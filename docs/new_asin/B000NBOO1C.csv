The producer must have known one person that had pits b/c all you'll see is the same shots of the same dogs shown. The only people who are interviewed are ignorant and hide behind masks. He claims to be pro-pit bull, yet there's not a single footage of all the positive and responsible owners.

2764209,1,B000NBOO1C,"1. This looks like someone's final project from a high school film class...it is completely amateurish in design, conception and presentation.

2. The ""filmmaker's"" heart does seem to be in the right place BUT he really has absolutely no knowledge of dog training, development, behavior and breeding (things that someone who is undertaking a documentary about dogs should have at least a passing unerstanding of); thus the information he presents is simplistic and not always accurate. He doesn't make good use of the interviews with professionals and spends way too much time interviewing idiots.

3. The filmmaker alludes to the APBT being a loyal, loveable family member; capable of succeeding in a number of activites. However does he interview and depict any of the thousands of pit bull owners titling their dogs in obedience, agility & weight pull? No. Does he show any of the pit bulls that work daily in search and rescue and as therapy dogs? No. Does he show pits cuddling on the couch with their families? No. He shows what seem to be his dogs, kept outside, on chains, looking completely untrained and quite frankly neglected. He makes a big deal about taking one of his dogs ""off the chain""...he then proceeds to let it drag him around the yard on a leash...WTF...anyone ever heard of ""heeling"" as in actually taking the time to train your dogs? I thought I would be treated to his dogs doing an obedience run through: sit, down, roll over, shake...whatever. NOPE. I did get to see a game of tug of war with an old towel that seemed to be trying to play up the dog's ""tough image"". When I play tug of war with my pit bull she sits for the toy to be presented and waits for the ""take it"" command. She also ""outs"" on command when the game is over. I expected the filmmaker to show something similar to really show how obedient and trainable these dogs are. Again, great big NOPE!

4. He spends his time interviewing inarticulate dog fighters who speak from behind masks, turn their backs to the camera and use the F word way too often (not a moral judgement here...but when you use it as every other word...are you really even saying anything remotely cogent?)

5. He interviews 2 breeders who (again, while their hearts seem to be in the right place) are not stellar examples of breeders ...which is who the filmmaker should be looking to if he is indeed trying to defend the breed. Unfortunately we are treated to some feel good rambling by back yard breeders who make absolutely no mention of genetics, health testing, early & on-going socialization and of course TRAINING.

6. I made it through the entire video; but it was painful. The pictures of dog fights and injured dogs were unpleasant to say the least. However the greatest difficulty was; from what I had heard, I thought finally the APBT was actually going to be SHOWN as the wonderful, loving and intelligent family companion that it can be...only to be treated to more footage of inarticulate, idiot dog fighters.

2764211,2,B000NBOO1C,"Procrastination is a funny thing! So it's taken me how long to write a review of this since first seeing it wayyyy back when it first came out? So, Bloodline! Kinda funny! Love Gino's eyebrows. The fake letter is good. It's something like 'Can I meet up with you, if you have the time'. Gotta keep those fans in check, Gino! Priory of Sion? I think it's a secret sect of hairdressers just itching to get their hands on his hair! Bendy Hammott is funny too! Ebay did well out of him :) Love to know who's hair they took away for analysis. It wasn't one from the top of his head, but may have been chest hair or something a bit lower? Middle Eastern descent, eh Ben, or is it Bill? Lots of weed out there!(British joke!) Gotta love vodka! What was up with all the expanding foam in the 'tomb'? Was there just lots of it in the shed?

There were some credible people in it. I like Tracy R Twyman, Margaret Starbird and Tim Wallace Murphy. Bruce was, well Bruce! Did we really have to see him in the middle of the night semi naked though, or at least in his vest! I suppose it created a bit of suspense, but it gave me nightmares for a while afterwards! Then there was Rob Howells. I have nothing bad to say about Rob. He's a nice guy. They didn't really go down into the Louvre museum to do an interview!

And then......Da Da Daaaaa, la piece de resistance, Nicolas Haywood What can I say about Nic that can be read by the general public? Not a lot! I think there may have been a bit of laughing during that long interview! Watch Nic try to keep a straight face at one stage. Well the gist of the movie is that Jesus and MM were married, had children and the environs of Rennes Le Chateau is their final resting place. It was because of Nic that I became interested in the area. I looked on from the outside, watching everyone fighting, arguing, speculating and going in circles. (Should it not be pentagrams and sacred diagrams?)Then something/one grabbed me by the leg and I got slowly sucked into the Rennes quicksands!

Nic is a nice guy, really. Probably the most fascinating person I will ever have the priviledge to speak with. Priory of Sion? Nah! I know most of you who know me, were expecting me to go Nic bashing, but I won't. I miss him!  Sorry!

So my summary of Bloodline? Has Nic in it and some other people who believe Jesus and MM were married and had children. Fake dummy and fake treasure trail. There is something about the Rennes area that will suck you in. If I find anything when I'm there, I'll make a movie about it :)",1394496000,,2540,4.261410788381743

2764215,1,B000NBOO1C,"Planted ""evidence,"" etc. Truly a sad story of lack of ethics: the maker of this movie admitted that he decieved people who were collaborating with him making this movie. Nor the deception was revealed to cinema owner who distributed this movie, etc. Things didn't seem right in this movie, so, after some research I found out that indeed the main ""archeologist"" did fake everything, fake ""mummy"" including. Now the maker calls it ""hoax."" No, a hoax is documentray like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kumare/dp/B00AMBJWB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kumare</a>&nbsp;in which fake guru explained to people he decieved them, that it was a hoax before the movie was even finished. Ben Hammot, on the other hand perpetuated the scheme for longer time for monetary gains. On the deception level even worse than<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Million-Little-Pieces/dp/0307276902/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Million Little Pieces</a>He apologized, and explained, but still the movie is an elaborate fraud. But kind of entertaining, in spite of lies.

Why I got tempted to see it in the first place?  Some documentaries can be entertaining, informative, and so on. Not this one. The evidence looks fake. The bottles strangely just above the surface of not very compacted earth, rather soft (there were supposed to be there for circa hundred years!), look fresh, with no discoloration on the surface, rolls inside unroll easily without breakage, and don't hold the shape strongly as would paper rolled for such long time, etc.no discoloration or foxing on the appear, fresh looking uniform ink, bottles easily opened. All looks fake. Than curious mistakes in Latin and French by a French priest! Was the priest really so semi-literate in his own language and also Latin he supposed to know well? This is funny! And all this stories about danger, etc. Oh yeah, there is deadly conspiracy to keep the secret.

The mummy itself is truly strange: what is the white stuff in the nose? Never seen a mummy like this, when noses shrivel they get dark like the rest of the body, and how  mystery in the movie for me.
Why? I doubt if anyone cares about such stuff, with exception of some treasure hunters and others. The idea of some powerful organizations some groups is childish, or paranoid, or for the sake of seeking attention. If the man is in such danger, why the maker shows him? It doesn't sound true.

 The antiquities of this kind can be bought cheeply also. They are nothing special of great value. I hope this documentary will not give a bad example and bring other amateur ""archeologists,"" or/and material to the area, as people who will be not able to recognize that this so called ""discovery"" is fake and will believe anything. Given the fact that the maker of this movie tries to bring a dose of anticipation and sensation, and I assume he can be very convincing. But not for everyone, luckily.

But the movie makers are able to give the sense of anticipation and create obvious sense of mystery, and sensationalism combined with thrills I think can make good money for the maker. Some people don't want to know the reality, anything which thrills is good enough. And because of this the others make money on the sense of boredoom some want to escape.  I doubt if many people care if the claims are spurious, because if the story is interesting they will not mind, I am sure. Sorry to be mocking, but this movie deserves it, and deserves a real critique, and in general maybe the claims by makers, or some authors relating to the subject should be more scrutinized? I am sure this would make a very interesting documentary. Who knows what relevant revelations would come up regarding materials and claims peddled by other makers/authors?

I find it strange that Amazon is continuing to sell this title after the recent public admission by Ben Hammott that the entire tomb story was a carefully contrived hoax.  I already own a copy and saw the film during its brief theatrical run.  There were many, many evidential flaws in the film, and these have been explained satisfactorily by Hammott's confession.  If anyone is still looking to purchase this title, they should be aware of the fact that many of the claims are fraudulent and much of the evidence faked.

2764219,1,B000NBOO1C,"The kind of ""documentary"" where almost every archaeological discovery happens at night because that's the best time to dig up artifacts and prowl around in churches. Thank god the local drunk had keys. Spookiness helps with mystery solving apparently, just ask the Scooby Doo crew. With ridiculous clues to the supposed location of the tomb of Mary Magdalene found in what looks like modern bottles and written on new looking paper with bright red ink in grammatically incorrect French, this documentary tries to be both treasure hunt and mystery. Too bad much of the data they present as facts has been debunked many times over (The Priory Of Sion) or is just plain wrong. Other discoveries don't really add up to much, though much is made of them. So ultimately this documentary comes off not as a voyage of discovery so much as a voyage of crap undertaken by a ship of con artists and as real as the Blair Witch Project. Too bad it's not as entertaining.",1330214400,,957,4.7023809523809526
2764220,3,B000NBOO1C,"In ""Bloodline,"" documentarian Bruce Burgess explores the theory, made popular by Don Brown's recent bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code,"" that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were lovers, that they fled to what is now modern-day France, and that French royalty can trace its lineage back to them and their children.  The theory also posits that this ""truth"" has been carefully guarded by a shadowy organization called The Priory of Sion, and that the Catholic Church will literally stop at nothing to keep the story from getting out.  Some contend that The Priory has been letting the details slip out little by little over the course of the centuries - mainly through art works with ""coded messages"" embedded in them - in a concerted effort to prepare the way for an illumination of the truth which, when finally revealed, will rock the very foundations of Christendom and thereby change the world.

Burgess spends much of the film interviewing people supposedly connected with or at least knowledgeable about the secret, individuals he meets in clandestine, off-the-beaten-path settings who speak in hushed tones about their theories and discoveries, and who claim to live in fear of their lives for even deigning to speak on the subject.  The bulk of the second half of the film is taken up exploring what Burgess and amateur archaeologist Ben Hammott claim may be the tomb of Mary Magdalene, located in an isolated area in the south of France.

In all honesty, who knows what to make of this film or the conspiracy theory itself?  Half the time the open-minded viewer feels as if he's watching something at least partway plausible - and the other half believing he's probably being made the dupe in an elaborate and colossal hoax.  In fact, there are many sites dedicated to debunking the whole theory, including the entry on The Priory of Sion found on Wikipedia.

As a nonbeliever myself, I have to say that nothing put forth by this film strikes me as being any less plausible or historical than what is contained in the gospels themselves - which is to say that I find them both HIGHLY implausible and a-historical.  I have no doubt that many people throughout the last two millennia have BELIEVED what Hammott and his minions are proposing, but that doesn't mean that any of it ever actually happened in real life.

Bloodline"" is one of those movies that comes replete with a website where you can look up further information on the topic if so inclined.  I suggest you look up quite a few others as well.",1327363200,,2501,4.793023255813954
2764221,4,B000NBOO1C,"I initially watched this online at snagfilms.com (free documentary website), and then I ordered it, and watched it again. This is a very good documentary- very high quality. It unfolds like a detective story, and the full impact of its discoveries are yet to be felt. For the uninitiated, this could be a jaw-dropping, mind-blowing, thought-provoking DVD.

I was already very familiar with the research behind Dan Brown's DaVinci Code, having studied it since reading ""The Passover Plot"" in the early 1970s, and ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" in the 1980s. I have formulated my own theories based on all this research. The evidence presented in this DVD is more than circumstantial. Much more. In fact, it is downright scary. Can the body of Mary be in France? Certainly. Can the body of Jesus be in France? Well, it depends on your point of view. As a Christian, my answer is NO! But can a body be found that matches the wounds that Jesus received on the cross? Absolutely! And if that happens the Bloodline that still exists today could become very important. And even if a body is not found, that Bloodline could still wield a tremendous amount of influence at just the right time. So, in my opinion, there is a reason why this story continues to gain more and more credibility.

I've gone online to try and find some follow-up information based on the findings presented on the DVD, but the government of France doesn't seem too motivated to excavate, plus they didn't seem that concerned about opening up a wall to get beneath the Church at Rennes-le-Chteau, and possibly accessing what Abbe Franois Brenger Saunire found there. There is plenty of mystery about this whole thing, and makes for an exciting DVD. I highly recommend it as long as you keep it in perspective.

Update: Ben Hammott has since come out and said he faked this whole thing, purchased the elements on the antiquities market, constructing and fabricating the site in a warehouse. The producer Bruce Burgess was unaware of this, and was duped along with the rest of us. Hammott said he did it to raise funds to continue looking for the body of Mary Magdalene which he truly believes to be in the area. However even his motive is questionable, because it appears that he has come out saying that he found the Ark of the Covenant in the Rennes-le-Chateau area, producing the same sort of photographic evidence; and he has also fabricated a picture of the Loch Ness monster. This is one guy to stay away from. He is a conman plain and simple.",1316390400,,2509,4.697727272727272
2764222,5,B000NBOO1C,"Firstly, I would highly recommend watching a BBC video titled ""Jesus-The Complete Story"". It is a video that brings a lot of information to light in regards to whom Jesus was, how the bible and he intertwine and how man's interpretation as well as science brings better clarity to so much of this specific history. Once armed with this information you can watch ""Bloodline"" with an open mind and see that this makes very good sense for the continuing story of Jesus and how ""God"" did not forsake Jesus while he was in the process of dying (or appearance of such) from crucifixion.

As children many of us were taught the traditional story. I, for one, asked many questions while in Sunday school (after all, I was in ""school"" and I wanted to do well) only to be told by the teacher to ""stop asking so many questions"" and that ""when I died and went to heaven God would answer all my questions."" It was foretold by many past cultures throughout the world that this time in history the truth will come out and that is exactly what is happening. To have ones life belief system shaken to the core is indeed very frightening. By accepting truth with an open heart & mind we can not only heal the past but grow and thrive in the future.

Another wonderful documentary pertaining to thriving in the future is ""Future by Design"" with Jacque Fresco. Very inspiring!! For the first time in a long time I feel strong hope that we can indeed make it through. Focus on the reality you wish to create.

I first watched Bloodline via Netflix and have come to Amazon to buy copies.",1310515200,,1565,4.465034965034965
2764223,5,B000NBOO1C,"An extremely good movie.  A documentary about Jesus Christ asks the question did Christ marry Mary Magdalene and did they have children?  I am not a Christian so it did not raise issues of faith for me, but did make me think of course!  The film makers suggest the Holy Grail are the children of Christ and Magdalene.  Just wonderful  and made so much sense.  The film maker tried to be as thorough as he could be but was blocked by adamant believers of Christianity at times.  Makes you think what ever your beliefs are.  A very good movie.",1307404800,,541,4.393939393939394
2764224,3,B000NBOO1C,"Christians have nothing to fear from this movie.  Even if Bloodline isn't a hoax (and I believe it is), filmmaker Bruce Burgess never delivers any credible evidence to back up his argument that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene, had at least one child with her, and, thus,  did not die on the cross.  Even if the discovery of an ancient tomb near Rennes-le-Chateau is real and does contain the body of Mary Magdalene (as the filmmaker believes), it does nothing to prove any of the film's wild suppositions that Jesus was anything less than the divine Son of God.  In fact, some of the supporting evidence of other finds presented in this documentary prove problematic to just such an argument.  In terms of entertainment value, Bloodline is quite good, complete with a fair amount of suspense, fascinatingly eccentric characters, a veiled sense of danger, and seemingly remarkable discoveries.  As a documentary, though, Bloodline leaves much to be desired - a one-sided presentation of ""facts,"" a series of huge leaps based on assumption, questionable evidence, and a sickening disregard for both the dead and the most basic rules of archaeology.

In between candid, confessional close-ups, filmmaker Bruce Burgess conducts interviews of questionable individuals, wanders around Rennes-le-Chateau (not always legally), and eventually teams up with amateur treasure-hunter ""Ben Hammott"" in a Dan Brown-inspired quest to discover whether Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene, fathered at least one child, and possibly settled in France (he can never decide if Jesus accompanied Mary Magdalene to France and died at the age of 45, whether Mary smuggled his body out of Jerusalem, or if the Knights Templar discovered His body and brought it back to France after the Crusades).  His main avenue of inquiry consists of making contact with representatives of the so-called ""Priory of Sion,"" said to be the centuries-old keepers of the great secret involving Jesus and Mary Magdalene.  Here we get to meet - among others - the wildly eccentric Gino Sandri, who claims to be the General Secretary of the Priory of Sion, and Nicolas Haywood, a spokesman of sorts for the Priory and, as far as I'm concerned, one of the coolest cats on the planet - if this man is just a mere actor, he is outstanding.

Things really begin falling into place once Burgess makes contact and establishes a working relationship with ""The Tomb man"" (""Ben Hammott""), who shows him video of a tomb he discovered in the hills near Rennes-le-Chateau - in the video, one can clearly see what appears to be a corpse covered by a shroud bearing the sign of the Knights Templar.  Burgess basically goes along for the ride as Hammott follows a series of cryptic clues supposedly left by Father B&eacute;renger Sauni&egrave;re, the priest who allegedly found a cache of revelatory hidden documents underneath the church in the late 1800s (which the Vatican quickly took possession of).  A series of bottles are discovered hidden around the countryside, each of them containing further clues to the mystery; then  a box is unearthed that supposedly holds relics from the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.  Ultimately, Hammott returns alone to the secret tomb he discovered, records more video of its contents, and then cuts open the shroud (thus desecrating the entire site in terms of evidence) to reveal the mummified face and hands of the corpse, whom he and Burgess would have us believe is Mary Magdalene.

Conveniently enough, the tomb remains inaccessible, so none of its contents can actually be tested for age or authenticity.  The scrolls which are uncovered in hidden bottles look remarkably good given their supposed age and did not crack at all when they were roughly opened up - and the writing looks every bit like that of a ballpoint pen.  The remarkable contents of the box that was unearthed (using a dowsing rod, of all things) are authentic but common objects from first-century Jerusalem which could easily have been purchased from antiquities dealers today.  Each of the objects is problematic in some way; the ungenterium, for example, is supposedly the jar with which Mary anointed Jesus' body - but the real jar was much larger and was broken by Mary at the time of anointing.  The filmmakers also make the mistake of equating Mary Magdalene with Mary of Bethany, despite evidence that they were two different women.

This story will have its proponents, but - in the end - it is all based on conjecture.  There is no way to know if the discovered corpse is even real, let alone that it is the body of Mary Magdalene - and there is nothing to indicate that anyone else was buried there with her.  The whole story plays like a scavenger hunt organized either by the filmmakers or some outside group feeding them the information they are hoping to find.  Fascinating?  Yes.  Believable - not at all.",1307232000,,4887,4.959558823529412
2764225,1,B000NBOO1C,"Ridulous if competent attempt to catch the coat-tails of Da Vinci Code. This is plainly a hoax, fairly well-acted by the lead, the putative filmmaker. He's oh so skeptical - as evidenced by his repeated claims that he's skeptical. He's not a shameless exploiter of the stupid - no - he's Open Minded. He's a Maverick intellectual, no less. You don't need a PhD to make great archaeological discoveries, he insists. This, of course is true. And also, there is no license for making movies; any crackpot or fraudster can (and does) do it.

Yes, true believers - Mary Magdalene is buried in France. The Man doesn't want you to know. (The Man = the Catholic Church) But you, brave truth-seeker, will go boldly, where no hoax-ster has gone before! Yes, into her very tomb. Of course, the Man will surely suppress these astounding discoveries. But you, noble Seeker of Truth, you now HAVE THE TRUTH on film.

I kind of enjoyed the wild-eyed goofballs they had playing representatives for the fabled Priory of Sion. (People, just google this. This is well-established as a hoax.) Were they in on the joke? Or did the movie makers troll through the underbelly of the lunatic world of conspiracy theorists, to find these people - dropping hints, looking knowingly, pretending to be afraid, or to be holding back on much more information. Hungry actors, or crazies? You be the judge - IF you have what it takes to sit through this dreck. They did go after, and get a small amount of usable footage from real scholars - not that what those PhDs said supported the silly premise of the film.

So if you really want to know if Jesus was married - seriously, you should look elsewhere. Ask any real historian, who isn't on the crackpot fringe. There is not a shred of credible evidence in this ""documentary"" for anything about ancient history, and abundant evidence of hoaxing.

2764228,1,B000NBOO1C,"I'm fond of the notion that every conspiracy theory contains a grain of truth. Indeed, the Jesus story is thoroughly misrepresented. Herein lies the ultimate irony and grain of truth. A conspiracy within and about a conspiracy, Bloodline inadvertently bumps up painfully close to the ultimate truth about the ""real Jesus"".

Wake up literals and fundamentalists! The story of Jesus was always a grand allegorical myth. Even Saint Paul himself never referred to Jesus as a flesh and blood person or anything more or less than a synthesis and distillation of the best of hundreds of years of pagan mythology. Granted, these stories woven together are rich with lessons and morals of great value. Nonetheless, overall orthodox fundamentalism has to be regarded as the most singularly damaging conspiracy humanity has ever known.

One of the most overt and damaging anthropocentric literal-isms is that humans are the ""chosen ones"", and are obligated to take dominion over the entirety of the natural world, consuming as much and as fast as possible. The perennial famous quote from the bible is illustrative: ""be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth"". Indeed, we've literally obeyed this directive with such a vengeance (except for the replenishing part) the planet is overpopulated by 5-6 billion and most earthlings are headed towards a massive extinction event.

It's the most unfortunate commentary that as educated as we may be, our current human condition and predicament results largely from a lack of comprehension and conception of the term ""metaphor"". The perennial questions (how and why we're here)will never be fully explained by science, much less charlatans or new age hucksters.

The ultimate collective conspiracy is that much of the continued exploitation and destruction of Earth is under the pretense and ruse of ""the second coming"". These lies are happily perpetuated by elites who know better; they see our bickering (and resulting polarity and division)over whose mythos is more comforting to our afterlife or apocalyptic fantasies as neatly convenient to their endgame.

Obviously these many falsehoods, regardless of the solace they may have originally offered, have not merely outlived their usefulness; they are now threatening our very survival. In my opinion if we stop treating ancient memes as sacred and off limits to the scrutiny of the time tested method of scientific inquiry; we may find that what we consider as self evident was only once so, and then only due to the narrow confines and the context in the times they were created.

The only real miracle is that we remain oblivious to the astonishing gift we've been given; a paradise and environment which has allowed us to evolve to the high level we have, (which is probably extremely rare in any universe) beings self-conscious of their self-consciousness.

It's insanity that we allow ourselves to be entranced, hypnotized and sidetracked by charlatans, while the truly sinful commentary continues to loop and cycle in our collective subconscious perpetuating a vast environmental conspiracy and the final assault on Gaia/Earth. This killing amounts to nothing less than matricide, eco-cide and Terra-cide.

This is such a laughable attempt at a hoax, it almost seems like a parody. Around every turn is some mysterious, deadly presence. Strangers approach the filmmaker with unheard-of historical finds they've never revealed to anyone else. A researcher finds not one but FOUR hidden bottles with earth-shattering evidence, buried just ever so sliiiiightly beneath a handful of dirt in a cave or underneath a rock. Within the bottles are parchments that are clearly modern-day note paper in absolutely pristine condition, spelling out all the secrets of Christianity. These ancient documents and artifacts are handled with all the care of a child rummaging through a box of Cracker Jacks. Every time an important artifact is found, the camera suddenly and inexplicably begins to move erratically and goes in and out of focus, despite being perfectly steady and clear moments before. Interviews are conducted always at night, sometimes with eerie, low-level lighting like you see in old-time horror movies. The filmmaker speaks into the camera lens in a manner reminiscent of ""The Blair With Project"". It's too much. It would have made a hilarious parody, if only they'd had the presence of mind to go in that direction. Instead, it's a dishonest attempt to cash in on the hype created by The Da Vinci Code. Just pitiful.

One especially hilarious image is the filmmaker in his seat on a train, reading ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"", with about a hundred different colored page markers, none labeled, covering just about every inch of the book.

2764233,4,B000NBOO1C,"Bloodline is an entertaining pop documentary that purports to examine the controversial assertion that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and like any red blooded American schmuck passed on his DNA down a line of descendents to the present day. This secret and the existence of evidence in support of it are supposedly currently guarded by the secret society the Priory of Sion. Our investigator/filmmaker Bruce Burgess takes us to the belly of this mysterious beast by way of Rennes-le-chateau, France where it's said that the evidence and possibly Mary Mag's mummy are entombed.

Once there our intrepid investigator attempts to solve the case by way of a motley crew of characters most of whom lean towards the comicly shady to say the least. Amateur archaelogist Ben Hammott's suspiciously successful mini ""quest"" is a hoot for sure and takes up the better part of the middle of this thing. Sion member Nicolas Haywood lends his own special brand of levity to to the proceedings, but it's hard not to imagine that he's really Peter O'toole having some fun at the filmmaker's expense. There are also suggestions of danger and murder conspiracies which are sadly laughable.

For anyone with two brain cells to rub together it's obvious that there's no attempt at due diligence by the filmmaker. There's barely any real critical analysis here although the material is just begging for it. Questions that would be obvious to a 10 year old are just left like so many loose ends. There are no real questions to be begged here though. The filmmaker doesn't take any of this to any real conclusions. He tells us what he believes no more no less - no harm no foul. As is usually the case with this type of documentary ""you be the judge"". To his credit he does occasionally question whether he's being scammed or not. By the very end he also provides us with the only voice of reason via Prof. Robert Eisenman who provides the sole instance of intelligent skepticism so lacking in the rest of the documentary. It's a little too late but it's enough to demonstrate that the filmmaker's intention isn't merely to scam less critical viewers.

As goofy as this film was I was gladly entertained by it. The controversy is intriguing and it's handled imaginatively here. It has much in common with those ufo/bigfoot psuedo-documentaries that were so popular on television and in theatres in the 70's and 80's. 'Bloodline' is only a hairs width more legit than those, but of course it comes no closer to being serious journalism. Anyone clueless enough to review this as a such has only punked themselves. If you're at all entertained by the tall tales related to Dan Brown's 'Da Vinci Code' you might like this.

The comments by Margaret Starbird and Rt. Rev. John Shelby Spong at the very end of the film are certainly food for thought and warmed me to the film enough to recommend it as light entertainment.

2764234,4,B000NBOO1C,"Bloodline Review

""Bloodline"" is a documentary from the Cinema Libre Studio directed by Bruce Burgess that explores the popular belief that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and fled to France with their child by following clues left in churches. It sounds very ""DaVinci Code"" and according to IMDB was released in 2008, 2 years after the ""DaVinci Code"" movie, more than likely in response to the peak of interest in the subject raised by the book/movie.

Bruce Burgess right away comes clean that the interest in the book is what propelled him to investigate the claims. He goes straight to the Louvre within the first few minutes and talks about the hidden messages in paintings and literature. The footage in the film has been taken from 2005 to 2006.

Burgess speaks with a spokesman for the Priory of Sion that became a public organization in 1956 but could not give away all the answers. This man indicated that certain works of arts are coded to allow a journey to the truth but it is too dangerous to say outright on film. Another mysterious guy in a cafe walks up and hands the spokesman a card with writing on it after which he shut up. Is the Priory real or a hoax? If it were a hoax, it is unlike any other hoax in history making the documents and ""proof"" so difficult to come across hiding the materials in libraries and churches. By releasing information gradually over a great deal of time, it is a lot more likely to eventually become widely accepted.

Tim Wallace-Murphy, an author on cracking codes speaks about Latin and anagrams and solving puzzles. He speaks of it as a game but asks the question, who is playing it? The claim is that Jesus did not come to die on the cross for the peoples' sins but to guide others to a path of a way of living and spirituality which would be a different version that would undermine the church's message for years. If a bloodline could be proved and came to light, many changes would take place. Some people the author met claiming to be from the bloodline were descended from Jersuleum, but it is unclear if they are direct from Jesus.

Burgess does a lot of investigating into his subject's backgrounds for authenticity and some people refuse to go on camera and are instead audio recorded. He tracks down a Nicolas Haywood who claims not to be a Priory of Sion member though others are convinced that he is. Haywood does agree to go under the lights on camera and agrees for the record that there is a bloodline and there is evidence for it, but the series of items that prove the bloodline are kept together in secret that he will not divulge. He puts on an aura as the cigarette smoking man like in ""The X-Files"" and seems much more mysterious with the smoke whirling around.

Suddenly Burgess' phones are apparently being bugged and he gets more involved in the story and it is hinted Burgess himself might be in danger too as well as people he is bringing into it. Haywood indicates that men who talk too much get poisoned, labeled as a cerebral hemorrhage including one person who dies before they can interview him. This is just the beginning!

The drama makes it very exciting with more at stake and might make you feel like you are living the DaVinci Code story all over again but you have to ask how much of it is contrived and how much is real. It is presented in an amazing way with discoveries supposedly being made live on camera, but from another perspective it all potentially could have been planted. There wasn't anything in the film that it wasn't possible in manufacturing circumstances, but then again it could all be real depending on how much you want to buy into it. The filmmaker obviously comes to a point of belief and continues to relate it in commentary. Whether you believe is completely up to you, but it's an interesting ride to say the least either way.

DVD Extras:

First off, the trailer for ""The Beautiful Truth"" that automatically played to get to the main menu caught my attention right away because it was so off topic of this piece and plays on a common fear people have about their teeth and claims to expose the greatest mercury poisoning one could have might be from fillings in their mouth and ominously asks ""How many fillings do you have?""

For bonus features, there is an extended interview with Nicolas Haywood without being cut up like in the film. Absent of the music, it's a little less spooky but more informative and realistic. The deleted scenes are in low resolution video with the website address etched across the center and show footage of taking the chest to a museum, coded messages in a church, exploring a quarry and underground labyrinth, and more tomb footage.

Director Bruce Burgess and Producer Rene Barnett have a commentary track for the film. After starting off talking about his red watch strap and the difficulties of looking pensive in the car while his cameraman attempted not to fall over, he admits that Haywood is the Bloodline version of Cancer Man from X-Files. They remark on how exciting some of their findings were and how some people were mysterious and withholding in their giving of information. Also the many warnings that Rene gave by phone are acknowledged but not explained. Many facts are just acknowledged but not expanded very much on.

More fascinating are the images of scientific documents examining hair found at the tomb and the fact that they aren't afraid to put them on the DVD. If you get the chance, check out this movie's website. It has a really neat opening graphic and is very detailed with more information about the film including news, a blog, and a photo gallery.

2764235,2,B000NBOO1C,"Recently I watched the ""feature pseudo-documentary,"" including all bonus features, Bloodline. In a nutshell the documentary presents a series of interrelated claims like the existence of Jesus' and Mary Magdalene's offspring; the protection of this bloodline by the 12th century, still existing and very powerful secret society the Priory of Sion (the real mover behind the Templars); and its coming out of hiding through its recent grand master Pierre Plantard. Central to the story is also the Roman Catholic priest, Brenger Saunire, who found around the turn of the 19th century evidence of the whole lineage hidden in his church in Rennes-le-Chateau. He became subsequently very rich and left curious clues of his knowledge for later generations to find. Burgess did interviews with self-declared representatives of the Priory, Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood, who were so kind to corroborate many of the astounding claims. Burgess was also to meet a British Lord to receive important additional information, but the chap suspiciously died a few days before the meeting would take place. Burgess then buddies up with a British treasure-hunter, Ben Hammot, and together, following Saunire's clues left in little bottles, find very suggestive evidence in a tomb close to Rennes-le-Chateau with possibly Mary Magdalene's remains. Hammot provides some footage of the inside of the tomb, though it's not really clear when and where the footage was taken. It has a mummy draped in something resembling a Templar tunic. They take a hair sample and have it analyzed by a professional laboratory and present the results indicating a middle-eastern origin.

Before giving my own interpretation, it looks that reviews of the film range between Paul Smith's debunking two-liner and Rob Humanick's enthusiastic assessment. Paul Smith described the documentary as an ""[a]ssortment of pseudo-historical claims, hoax treasure discoveries and motley crew of charlatans. Totally uncritical 'documentary' giving the doubt to the extremely ludicrous."" (1) Rob Humanick stated that ""[c]oncrete or not, however, the physical evidence of his [Jesus'] bloodline as shown here is awesomely compelling, from interviews with individuals claiming intimate knowledge on the Priory of Sion--the organization rumored to have long protected the secrets of Jesus' life as covered up by the Catholic Church--to an extended exploration of a French tomb that contains what may very well be the mummified remains of Mary Magdalene.""

There seem to be at least three ways to deal with the whole Priory of Sion / Rennes-le-Chateau / Jesus' bloodline issue:

2764239,5,B000NBOO1C,"This was a great film. Unlike ANY others on the subject, both in what was presented and how it was acquired and what other possibilities it might uncover and what the implications might be. It is exciting in and of itself without needing the usual dramatic special effects to make it that way.  And it has value for a number of reasons ...one in revealing unusual and surprising information (even for those who have other research on the subject) NOT revealed before and surprising to most...while leaving you to assess for yourself what that information means to you. The methods shown of the acquiring some obscure and yet very relevant information, was interesting (for some i know, it kept them on the edge of their seat), highly informative, and extremely thought provoking  and even more so, if you have a mature desire to really know the historical, spiritual and scientific truths that might affect our perceptions of reality and our individual life journeys.

So, everyone at all interested in this subject, should see this and would benefit from its presentation of information that everyone has a right to have access to, but up to now didn't, to this extent, even with some of the other good research already done both popular and obscure.  I think it suggests and questions what the evidence shows rather than imply that anything at this point is absolute and conclusive and that it was designed to do that...so any criticism that it is overdramatic and it doesn't prove anything is sort of out of place and is missing the real message inherent in the manner of presentation of the material and intent of the film itself.

Done the way it was, viewers are given the opportunity and encouragement to think for themselves and it does not claim to prove anything at this point and time...but does show information, interviews and experience shared that most do NOT HAVE access to and SHOULD and should want to if they want to know the truth (the whole truth that is).  I believe that it also encourages independent thinking and soul searching as to what the implications are IF certain things are true that we may not have thought about before...as well as open discussion of things typically hidden or suppressed. It further encourages the questioning of long held beliefs and dictates to see if THESE ARE SOUND AND PROVEN OR JUST SOMETHING WE DO ACCEPT AND CHOOSE TO BELIEVE and if we do question ...where the answers to those questions can be found along with what are the repercussions of that to ourselves individually or as a collective consciousness.

 Isn't that the purpose of most documentaries?....to  expose or show possibilities and probabilities and even to suggest further exploration of these without necessarily claiming the knowledge thus far to be absolute or conclusive? So i don't think anyone can criticiZe it on it's validity of the evidence that is shown or the value of it's being meaningful and provoking to a mature, intelligent, mind, as well as exciting and potentially life changing for us who do see its implications and continue to learn and refine our ability to assess what any sources of information tells us.

Everyone i know who saw it did not want to miss this opportunity to see this kind of documentary on this subject. The BEST that I see that this film has to offer is that IF what is presented here as evidence of certain possibilities IS TRUE and if it CAN be proven beyond a doubt it IS....it's implications are profound and important to all people everywhere, regardless of individual beliefs and historical claims of the past.  For that alone we should find ourselves worthy of such an opportunity to experience that which someone found value in searching out and presenting to us.

Finally what the producers of and contributors to this film gave of their knowledge, minds, thought provoking insights and personal experiences shared is of high quality OF HONESTY AND COURAGE and INTERGRITY along with extremely high level of dedication WHEN UP AGAINST GREAT CHALLENGES, greater even that what is often the qualities of works produced on this subject.

I can say this without hesitation or assumption, having viewed the film in a theatre and having met and spoken with the producers/ director in person where additional information and insights into it's creation were revealed to a much greater extent than could be acquired from only viewing the film itself. After that, I saw it several times over and  with a more expanded and deeper understanding each time, of what was going on that might be missed in just one viewing.

For this reason I would want to own this DVD TO VIEW OVER AND OVER again and to revisit, as new information and conclusions are drawn along the way from whatever sources. This will mean so much more once you view the film and once you see what i cannot say in words without giving away what should not be said out of context as part of a sequence of events that took place in the making of the film.

What makes the film most interesting ....beyond the subject matter...is the UNEXPECTED that occured and what direction each bit of information or experience took the inquisitor every step of the way. You almost experience/ live the journey with him...and it is NOT ACTING and NOT FICTION because it is a filming of something as it is happening.  So it is more than a documentary.  It is both a journey and a documentary and an unveiling and it is history in the making. I hope many more people see this film and i think it makes a great gift.",1229644800,7,5527,4.751565762004176

2764243,2,B000NBOO1C,"Man creates documentary about the bloodline of Jesus, with compelling evidence that Jesus did not die on the cross. It sounds like a great premise. Unfortunately, the evidence is not compelling and the attempt to make it more exciting comes across somewhat overblown, like the kabuki acting in Ran (Kurosawa's kabuki version of King Lear - great film; this isn't).

If you have read The Da Vinci code (or saw the Tom Hank's cliff note version - another good film), you have an inkling of what is going on. In this film, Bruce Burgess digs deep into the world of the Priory of Sion and the mystery of Brenger Saunire and Rennes-le-Chteau, the village where he was a priest. If you have read the source material Dan Brown used (Margaret Starbird's books, or Holy Blood, Holy Grail), you are right on track.

Within the first few minutes, we are thrown into a faux thriller, with unseen baddies that are apparently out to hurt, maim or kill all of the participants in the film. I say unseen as we never get a glimpse of any of the bad guys, nor does anyone associated directly with the film die. There is one person who dies of a stroke, or cerebral hemorrhage, but there is no evidence this person could have given any information or was killed due to his association with this film.

The film lost me within the first few segments. Rather than state allegedly or possibly, all of the theories, no matter how out there, are stated as facts. Characters known to have perpetuated fraud are presented as persecuted visionaries. It gets a bit annoying after you realize the entire film is going to be this sort of propaganda.

Where it starts to get funny is when the narrator (Bruce Burgess) starts re-enacting bits as if they were filmed as the story unfolded. You know the bits are re-enacted as no low-budget documentarian would film every time he picked up the phone, just in case his producer was calling to tell him some guys (the invisible bad guys) were coming to get him so he should stay away from his hotel. It continues to get more and more sensation as the film goes on.

After tooling around Paris and London, talking to a couple of ""Priory insiders"" (both of which appear to be a marbles short), and speculating about a possible murder by stroke, the filmmaker and his French producer finally get to Rennes-le-Chteau.

In Rennes-le-Chteau, they find a local artist who takes them down to a secret room that nobody has seen (except of course anyone who has asked, according to many Rennes sites) and start to unravel the mystery that leads to the tomb.

During the last half, we find a secret box that contains a stone chalice (Indy fans will be thinking ""carpenter's cup"") a perfume annointing jar and a variety of ancient coins. These are found in the well known ""Cave of the Magdalene"" across the valley from Rennes-le-Chteau. They are very fortunate, indeed, that no Rennes explorers were smart enough to find this.

Then, it gets better. Late at night, Ben Hammot takes them down a side road and has them stand guard while he goes to film (and desecrate) the tomb. Just like any other documentarian worth his salt, Bruce says ""sure, go film that all by yourself and I will stand guard."" Okay, so he doesn't actually say that, but the film in the movie is supposedly shot by Ben, all by his lonesome.

The best part of the movie, for me, is when he talks to Robert Eisenman, a well known liberal bible scholar and archaelogist. Eisenman nicely hands Bruce Burgess his head on a platter, explaining why he should not be too excited: ""It's too perfect! Why is the shroud sitting there with the cross so you can see? Why, in a wet climate like Southern France, hasn't that whole thing rotted away?"" Priceless.

If you don't mind loose facts, you can very well come away a bit excited about this film. If you are looking for a film to ""prove"" religion is bogus, and don't care much about how loosely the evidence is chained, you might like it.

Despite the fact the film is horrible on facts, I would have given it a better rating if the cloak and daggar stuff actually worked. As it stands, it feels like it is woven into the story to make it an easier sell. There are parts that are so obviously restaged that it comes across as Vaudeville.

On the plus side, the film is fairly well filmed for a low budget documentary. The filmmaker also does not take potshots at his guests (ala Bill Maher or Michael Moore). But he also stacks the deck with Rennes enthusiasts, ""experts"" simpathetic to the Bloodline theory and liberal biblical scholars. Not exactly the balanced approach.

I would like to see this subject revisited in a fair, unsensationalized documentary. I would also like more information on what has transpired with the evidence since they finished editing the film last year. I would like to see the DNA test results, etc.",1224201600,13,4844,4.592592592592593

2764249,1,B000NBOO1C,For those of you INhuman humans who are attracted to dogfighting you should realize this viciously cruel pursuit of yours is ILLEGAL in ALL 50 states!  And Amazon is NO better for selling dogfighting propaganda!  I'm just glad the feds are keeping records as to who is buying and distributing this dvd for prosecutorial purposes!,1187308800,12,329,4.963636363636364
2764250,1,B000NBOO1C,"For at least two years, Amazon.com has been infamously--and incorrectly--touting its ""right"" to sell materials promoting illegal animal fighting, blatantly peddling dogfighting videos as well as cockfighting magazines like The Gamecock and The Feathered Warrior. Even the recent storm of publicity about the evils of dogfighting has not deterred the company from profiting from illegal animal fighting.

Amazon.com's persistence is all the more disturbing because it comes after Congress passed legislation making it a FELONY offense to ship publications containing ""commercial speech"" for the purpose of promoting or ""in any other manner furthering"" animal fighting.

Amazon.com's refusal to acknowledge this is perplexing, as it most certainly is aware of the illegality of certain materials. In 2005 and again in 2007, Amazon.com removed a dogfighting video from its website, in recognition of a federal law that prohibits profiting from depictions of animal cruelty. Amazon.com has pulled Nazi propaganda from its website based solely on its offensiveness.

This should not be sold.",1187222400,9,1086,5.775

I mean, really?! If they truly thought the find was legit, they should have taken the artifacts to a specialist immediately so that they could be authenticated. The stupidity is just unbelievable.
