3959299,5,B002NKD4B2,"Excellent all around video.  Great child's learning toy was purchased for my granddaughter who just loves noddy:)she loves to ""sing along with noddy""!",1344729600,,150,5.521739130434782
3959300,3,B002NKD4B2,"Having grown up reading the Noddy books by Enid Blyton and then discovering the series on youtube for my one-year-old to watch (he LOVES them), I was thrilled to find it at such a reasonable price on Amazon. However, when our DVD came and we popped it in, imagine my surprise to find that Noddy and all his friends had suddenly become Americans! Huh?!!! I do NOT understand why PBS (or whoever) felt like it needed to be completely redubbed for an American audience. British English is completely intelligible--well for the most part--if you don't let kids hear British accents they might grow up to become like my friend who was unable to watch any of my awesome BBC dramas because she couldn't understand what they were saying, and that would be real shame :^) Seriously toying with sending this back and continuing to watch it on youtube.",1331856000,7,841,4.6891891891891895
3959301,5,B002NKD4B2,"I was skeptical about ordering this DVD set because of the negative review, but for the price, I thought...well, why not.  Kids, much like us adults, have their own preference anyway.  So, I let my  toddler watch it.  He loves it! The shows do not have very dull moments which is great because kids, especially toddlers, have very short attention span.  The show teaches good values and lessons.  It teaches words in a variety of languages which adds to the fun.  I don't quite expect TV shows to teach foreign language thoroughly anyhow.  All in all, my very active little boy finds this very entertaining.  Definite 5 stars as far as I'm concerned - we definitely got more than what we paid for!",1328140800,4,697,4.6016260162601625
3959302,4,B002NKD4B2,Lots of Noddy for a fair price.  Now that the show is off the air this collection is an adaquate substitute.,1304208000,,108,4.142857142857143
3959303,5,B002NKD4B2,"I absolutely love this for my three year old. It teaches new words in different languages like Spanish, Russian, and Mandarin. It also emphasizes diversity, helping others, being moral, and sharing, as well as many other good manner type lessons.
I first found this show on pbs and my daughter was unhappy when they cancelled it. I was so happy I found it on amazon its the reason I became a customer. Its also good for boys and girls. my only wish is that it wasn't a double sided disk but other than that perfect.",1302652800,5,515,4.431578947368421
3959304,1,B002NKD4B2,"First of all, we don't have cable so I purchased this dvd having never seen Noddy before. I was less than impressed. The characters are kinda weird looking, the stories are not realistic (the episodes occur in Toyland), and they teach kids words in different languages, but never the words or the same language. I remember one word being Russian, and they also said a word in Swahili. I guess that makes it educational but I'm just not sure there is much use in my son knowing how to say a bunch of random words in all different languages.",1299715200,,539,4.454545454545454
3959305,5,B002NKD4B2,This DVD set was purchased for my 4 year old granddaughter to watch while she is here at my house...she loves watching Noddy... Thank you so much  What a Great Value it was for the DVD Set!!!! And for the fast shipment..,1283558400,,220,4.238095238095238

3959310,5,B002NKD4B2,"My toddler loves this DVD.  I found him watching it at daycare and noticed nothing could take his attention away from it.  So we started watching it on my laptop at home everyday. No I can have my laptop back and he can watch his Noddy DVD's in his room.  Thanks for shipping this so fast!!!  No scratches, packaging was perfect and I will purchase again soon.  Thank You!!",1368662400,2,373,4.3478260869565215

3959314,4,B002NKD4B2,"My daughter saw Noddy for the first time at daycare. It comes on Sprout, right before Barney (which, much to my dismay, she also loves). As the On Demand menu only offers a limited number of Noddy episodes and watching the same three with her over and over for weeks was driving me crazy, I ordered this! I was expecting a little more actual Noddy episodes, and less of the language lessons but I'm not disappointed. I would have prefered one-sided discs, but two-sided are better than none!",1360540800,4,491,4.590909090909091
