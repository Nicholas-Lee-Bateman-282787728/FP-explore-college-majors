Luciano Salce is a classic Italian comedy, reminiscent of movies
from the 70's, such as Duddley Moore's 10, for example.

This movie may interet those with a passing interest in Italian
cinema, comedies from the 70's, generally, and couples who have the
are able to measure or see their relationship objectively, such as
needs, wants, desires, the ups and downs, the frustrations, and
disappointments over 5, 10 or more years.

The story succeeds tremendously, with a number of risible
scenarios, helped by a credible cast of actors comprised  of the
lovely (youthful, almost unrecognizable) Barbara Bouchet, as well
and the amusing, charismatic Monica Vitti, coupled with with the
macho yet family-man Ugo Tognazzi (playing Vitti's husband.)

The visuals are great, the filming locations attractive, such as
the wealthy modern home, featuring an villa architecture, furnished
with every high-tech device imaginable at the time (VCR, movies,
handycam, etc). There are some segments on location at a private
beach, including a yacht,  underling the Sunny Italian coast and
good weather on Italy's coasts.

Indeed, there is a mature treatment of relationships, while at the
same time, a biting humor to the interactions between man and woman
... the dynamics  often  extreme, in the oscillating emotions, from
jealousy  to passion, from a calculated mental approach, to an
irrationality stemming from various emotions and circumstances
faced at various times.

The action unfolds seamlessly, with  a dream-like quality, aided by
unpredictable twists in the story.

The version of the DVD reviewed, was released is the native
Italian, with Spanish and Italian subtitles (no English.)

Although extremely rare in 2011, it's a definite cultural gem and a
milestone in European cinema over 100 minutes.",1307491200,2,1857,5.377162629757786
