The whole movie is a convoluted mess and comes off more nonsensical than anything. Its just really not interesting and its complexity loses the viewer to boredom. The acting is pretty decent and I guess there are a couple of cool scenes but for the most part its not very entertaining.",1476489600,,445,4.6455696202531644
8746829,4,B01A9QVZMG,"Three Americans in Australia for fun and sun come across a couple of local boys who tell them a ""real live"" ghost story. The story goes, a motorcyclist was killed one night on the road by a car of speeding teens. If a carload of teens go speeding down the highway, a light appears behind the car that looks like a motorcycle. The kids do it and sure enough they see the light except for Maya (Jessica Tovey) whose hobbies include nose bleeds, bad dreams , and sleep walking.

After a night at the local's house they go try it again, this time stationing Oscar (Andrew Ryan) on the side of the road with phone camera to catch a close up of said ghost...things don't go the way the kids would have wanted it.

The script shows originality. I thought the twist was a letdown as compared to the biker story. It was at this point the low budget aspect entered the film. The build up to the killings was more scary and suspenseful than the killing themselves.

Guide: F-bomb. Brief rape and nudity (Piera Forde) 3 1/2 stars",1464739200,,1017,4.37037037037037
