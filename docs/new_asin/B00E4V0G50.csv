8601155,4,B00E4V0G50,I am a huge fan of Crystal Gayle even after all these years.  I wish that there was more of Crystal and less of Davidson and Loring on this DVD.  For this reason I liked CRYSTAL GAYLE-CHRISTMAS IN SWEDEN better because there  was much more with Crystal. There was a quick delivery time as usual with Amazon.  Good item!  The locations are beautiful.,1400544000,2,349,4.476190476190476
8601156,3,B00E4V0G50,"We love Crystal Gayle and were expecting a rather recent Crystal Gayle concert experience when we ordered this DVD with the release date of 2013.  However, as we viewed it, it was obviously a very old production.  Not enough Crystal Gayle and it wasn't in HD.  At the end of the DVD and the credits appeared, it was apparently produced in 1990.  Very disappointed.",1391472000,,364,4.640625
