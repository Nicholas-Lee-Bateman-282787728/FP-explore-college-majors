8030047,2,B0002OXUTW,"If you are thinking of buying this, you should be aware that it includes absolutely no nudity or sex. It does have some graphic violence, if that is what you like.",1304208000,2,163,4.290322580645161
8030048,3,B0002OXUTW,"I liked the connection between the two main characters. The idea is quite good, alas the acting and the story could sometimes do better. Anyway, worth seeing.",1249430400,,158,4.888888888888889
8030049,5,B0002OXUTW,"It was definitely worth picking out from my local video store. Thank goodness, this was not a slasher horror movie. I love this movie cause it was creepy and strange. It made the story seem more real compared to the recently produced and commercialized horror movies. Carl is an evil man. He made me cringe everytime he was flirting with the girls. You can tell from this, he doesn't know how to socialize cause he spent so much time being home alone and browbeatened by his mom. What a psychotic family. This is a movie worth seeing.",1154390400,,534,4.515463917525773
8030050,2,B0002OXUTW,"I ordered this movie,having never seen it. Once is more than enough. It was just an all-around dud. It might appeal to some people,but it just didn,t grab my interest. Buy at your own risk.",1152576000,2,189,4.428571428571429
8030051,5,B0002OXUTW,"With a good director, good unkown actors, and a good script, this is what quality story telling is about. The story is compellig and twisted, but you can't take your eyes away. The dialogue is witty and snappy. The funniest scene is when the killer talks to his Mom on the phone and she's telling him her story as to why she ran out of toilet paper on Tuesday instead of Sunday. The sickest is the dinner with the killer, the captive and Mom. I highly reccomend this taunt thriller. It never goes where you think it will.",1117756800,2,521,4.326530612244898
