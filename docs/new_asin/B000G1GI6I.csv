2597474,5,B000G1GI6I,This DVD gives an outstanding and intelligent exercise and relaxation experience and provides variety and challenge as one becomes comfortable with the routines.  Thank you.,1155254400,14,173,5.92
2597475,5,B000G1GI6I,I use this video to help about 15 seniors stay active everyday! they love the pace and clarity of each segment!,1478563200,2,111,4.333333333333333
2597476,5,B000G1GI6I,"I have never been able to coordinate my breathing and movements always so stressed by yoga programs which frustrated me which, let's face it. not the mood Yoga should engender.  But this DVD is fantastic! John, the instructor, has a great way about him and occasionally has a pattern to the breathing, but more often he just reminds you to breathe. And that always makes me smile.
I have to say here that I have never exercised and only tried Hatha Yoga many years ago for a brief time and did enjoy the few times I went to a class. But that is the issue for me.. going to a class somewhere. I am not a joiner by any stretch of the imagination and this is why I like this DVD so much. You can do it in your jammies...or nude if you are that kind of person. :-)
I had previously purchased a DVD that was supposed to be Yoga for inflexible beginners and the airy fairy music drove me crazy before I had gotten a few minutes into it. Couple that with the fact that they were floor exercises.. and that was an epic fail for me. I mean, if I could easily get onto the floor, would I really need Yoga?
The fact that many of the exercises are done while sitting in a chair, with no creepy music to jangle your nerves, makes this a great program for nearly everyone. Thank you John Schlorholtz!",1477526400,21,1286,4.185483870967742

What did I find - that anyone who buys this DVD is getting screwed. The DVD stops and stutters; there is no way to go back to the previous page.

2597520,5,B000G1GI6I,"this is a wonderful dvd. It's deceptively easy, but as it says in the dvd just because the moves are simple doesn't mean you 're not getting a good workout. highly recommended",1392336000,,175,4.5
2597521,5,B000G1GI6I,"My Mother has been doing John's yoga routines daily for six years now. They are especially meaningful and valuable as she uses a walker and has great pain and difficulty walking due to orthopedic issues. These chair exercises enable her to see seniors doing what she is doing, increase her circulation, exercise both halves of the brain, raise endorphins/mood, and empower her every time she does them.

We alternate John's with Anne Burnell's exercise DVDs of chair exercises for seniors/physically challenged persons; Anne's DVD has 2 discs, one for 'strength' and the other for 'stretch.' Anne's methods are fun and easy and stimulating and lend variety to the 'workout week' my 88-year-old mother does daily.

I highly recommend these products for physically challenged seniors. We prefer them to other DVDs as the participants onscreen include seniors, physically challenged, and not just young 'hot bodies' who are not operating at the same level as the older participant.  Excellent for home use, and in senior living facilities too.",1390608000,14,1040,5.253012048192771

2597533,5,B000G1GI6I,"I've decided to edit my review and put the cautions first - since it's so long-winded I'm afraid nobody will read through the good stuff and get to them :o) It will always be a 5-star program for me regardless.

Cautions for anyone with weak knees or stiff hip joints so you won't hurt yourself like I did before you realize it:  beware of any movement described as Bounce, Swing or Shake until you know you can safely do them.  This was made for strong healthy people but can be adapted by anyone old and stiff if you are careful of just those few movements. Watch the DVD more than once before you start, and imagine yourself making the movements and you should be able to tell what might hurt.  The program automatically goes to ""Joint Freedom"" first which is wonderful for loosening up all your joints.  The toe exercises loosened up my frozen toe joints in just a few days - no more excruciating toe cramps and improvements in the numbness.  Don't rush into the ""swing your knees"" as vigorously as shown if you have any stiffness - start with gentle slow movements and over time you will find you can actually swing your leg out from the knee a little easier.  The only movement in this particular segment that caused me longterm pain was the second routine standing behind the chair ""find your hip joints"" - the first one with your feet straight is fine.  But the second one where you are supposed to turn your toes in and go through the movements again, puts too much strain on the knees and might rip a ligament loose which is what it felt like I did.

The second one to watch out for is in the segment ""Stretch Out"" - again part of the standing routine.  ""Bounce your legs to relax your groin"" can cause instant pain in your hip joints, then ""bounce your knees"" while in a lunge position puts way too much strain on sore or weak knees.  It says do tiny movements if you have sore knees, but the strain of being in the lunge position even standing still can still hurt them.  Find something else to do until he gets through this - you will find other safe leg movements to substitute in the time allotted.

The ""Strength"" segment is great - the only thing to be careful of is the ""knee swings"" and that's only if you have sore or weak knees.  Knee swings are also in the next segment called ""Loosen Up"" plus a ""bounce like a spring"" that might be avoided or do it slower. The last one is ""Balance and Breath"" which is great for improving your balance.

Now for the good stuff:  It has taken over a year and numerous useless DVDs from other people to find something to alternate with my Anne Burnell Yoga which I consider the gold standard in senior yoga, especially if you have fibromyalgia.  I've been using her program for over a year and a half and plan to use it the rest of my life as the slow deep breathing leaves you feeling energized and refreshed, all the movements are seated and very slow and easy, no strain anywhere.  Now I've got John's to go with it for increasing mobility and which I also plan to use the rest of my life as they provide different benefits.  I couldn't believe the improvements in range of motion with John's exercises in just a few days time - I've been using this about 5 months.  I've had health issues for many years that prevent me from doing any strenuous activity and I credit Anne Burnell with literally saving my life by allowing me to start moving again.  John's program enhances the improvements in movement - I couldn't reach my feet to tie my shoes, now I can. :o)  Getting up out of a chair and getting dressed is much easier too.

John presents the exercises in a very upbeat encouraging way and makes it fun.  Thank you John!  There are five different great sessions done mostly sitting down and only last 15-20 minutes so you can do a different one every day of the week, and that's just the basic part.  There's enough variety in the 5 segments you will never get tired of them - Stretch Out,  Strength, Loosen Up, Joint Freedom, and Balance & Breath.  They are all so easy to do you might think they wouldn't do any good, but I promise you will notice a cumulative effect in a very short time. There's a lot more on the DVD for people in better health that I haven't even looked at.  One segment is not enough for me as the time goes by so quick,  so I always choose at least two and sometimes add a third to do in a row - by skipping the end relaxation until the last one, it only takes about 45 minutes for 3, about the same amount of time I spend on Burnell yoga plus Mark Johnson's Tai Chi on alternate days.  The only disappointment is the 30 minute sitting routine - I wish it had been a planned out sequential 30 minute workout, instead it's pieced together with segments from the 5 short sessions and seems a little disjointed as it jumps around.

I'm so used to the slow deep diaphramatic breathing after doing Burnell yoga for 19 months it's hard to breathe in time with the much faster movements by John.  In fact if I try to deep-breathe as fast as he's saying 'inhale, exhale' it makes me hyperventilate LOL.  Some of his movements lend themselves well to the deep breathing and I find myself slowing down to breathe deep and doing less repetitions.  I highly recommend this DVD as a more gentle exercise-oriented type of yoga, and Burnell's as healing yoga (it is based on Iyengar) that gets oxygen to every cell in your body - you will find your lungs won't let you slump when sitting or standing because they are so happy to be expanded to their limits :o)  Thank you John and Anne for making my fibromyalgia bearable!",1357776000,14,5595,4.35645472061657

2597535,5,B000G1GI6I,"This dvd is such a part of my life now that I had to buy it twice. You can work on balance, strength, breathing, joint loosening and others for any length of time you choose. He includes a very good meditation at the end of each session.

I have one of those bp cuffs at home here, and after I complete my yoga time, the drop in my bp numbers are always lower. The longer the workout the longer the benefits last. This is a most excellent program. He has 2 dvd's. One is sitting work, the other is floor and standing work. He had an illustrated book out some years ago which I owned and practiced some of his illustrated yoga exercises. He really knows his work!

This yoga program provides a good indoor routine which is varied, makes me feel better consistently and provides a nice meditation time. If you are searching about for a good effective routine to do indoors, you might want to check this one out.",1353283200,4,909,4.309941520467836

My orthopedic specialist said that gentle yoga would be good.  The yoga exercises on this DVD really work for me and the way the video is set up you can create your own daily routines and change them so that you won't get bored doing the same routine everyday.

The other people in the video that do the exercises with him are everyday people - no glamorous bodies in revealing outfits. There are many options in routines and a beautiful music section. The exercises are stretches and movements, not poses like The Sun Salutation or The Downward Dog for example.",1337990400,6,609,4.495495495495495

As it turns out -- the tortoise and the hare applies to fitness -- you don't have to be fast, thin, tall, or anything else... slow and steady is all it takes.

And boy am I glad.

The instructor is easy to follow, and the exercises are simple to adapt to my own particular needs.  I haven't tried everything on the DVD (and may never,) but those things I do -- are perfect for maintaining flexibility.

Also, the exact times are given, so a routine that fits one's schedule can be chosen.  (Most are around 18 minutes.)

There are also complete relaxation positions in between each practice performed. Meditative in quality, this is a huge asset and incentive for them to attend class regularly. They know they will leave relaxed and loosened.

Six weeks ago I found that the pain from my osteoarthritis of the hip and back had become too much for me to bear. I knew that I needed authentic healing beyond pain-killers or surgery. I am only 56 and yet my condition had degenerated to the point that I could hardly walk. I purchased John's 2-DVD set of all of chair, floor and standing routines, and I began with the chair program. Six weeks later I am doing the gentle floor and standing routines quite well, feeling stronger, more flexible and happier by the day. But even though I can do the standing routines now, I still think with fondness of the chair routines I did first. John gets a lot of breath and movement out of you in a chair! and I gained my first strength and sense of hope back through these routines. I have thought of my own deceased Mother so much as I became strong in the chair. How I wish that I had known about this DVD for her sake when she was alive. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who feels weak, confined or hopeless because of their age or disability - even those confined to wheelchairs.

2597573,5,B000G1GI6I,"John's chair yoga dvd is excellent.  I am a yoga teacher and one of my classes is teaching chair yoga to seniors.  What I learned from the dvd is helpful in teaching my seniors.  My students enjoy the routines so much that they clap after class  The routines are easy to follow with precise directions.  In addition to demonstrating himself, he has two other students on chairs offering alternative positions for those who are less mobile in certain areas.  I feel John is actually here with me during the demonstrations.  Also, the dvd is divided into different types of practice, e.g., joint mobility, gentle, looseners. This makes it easy to select an appropriate routine for that particular day.  I believe these routines will help students of any age to gain flexibility, strength, increased circulation, a sense of confidence and accomplishment, and through that to experience more joy in their life.

8128419,3,B000G1GI6I,"I came across this DVD at a used book sale.  I am a yoga instructor, and I admit, I fell for the description on the DVD case, which said that this DVD offered innovative teachings ""whether you are a yoga instructor or a beginner.""  I also expected that as the subtitle suggested, there would be both chair AND standing yoga sequences, plus I assumed that with the vast variety the DVD had to offer--over 60 routines!--there would be plenty to suit my needs, whether for practice or to assist with my teaching.

Unfortunately, the way that this DVD is marketed is extremely deceptive.  First, although the DVD does include both chair and standing stretches, there are NO practices that are entirely standing--some are all seated, and all others are a mix of seated and standing work.  This is obviously fine if that's what you want (and may be better for those wanting chair yoga only), but it was NOT what I had expected.  Second, while there are TECHNICALLY 60 practices on this DVD, by no means are these unique footage!  By my count, there are about 11 unique sequences on this DVD--5 labeled as Gentle, 5 called Challengers, and 1 meditation.  The various practices on the DVD simply feature these practices strung together in different ways--e.g., a single sequence, or 2, 3, 4, or 5 sequences combined together for a longer routine.

A final issue that I had with this DVD is that it is VERY hard to navigate.  There are actually instructions in the DVD insert for the ""Technologically Challenged,"" but not only are these poor done, they would not even be necessary if the DVDs menus were simply better constructed.  Part of the problem is that instead of defaulting to a Main Menu, the DVD loads an E-Z or Quick Start Menu (and yes, it is called different things in different places--also confusing!).  It is difficult to know where the options on the Quick Start Menu come from in relation to the rest of the DVD, but here they are as listed:

Sitting Only, 30 minutes
Stretch Out, 18 minutes
Stretch, 19 minutes
Loosen Up, 17 minutes
Joint Freedom, 18 minutes
Balance & Breath, 18 minutes
MORE OPTIONS

More Options leads to the Main Menu, which offers Gentle-Sitting Only-Challengers-Meditations-Credits.  The Sitting Only segments are taken from both the Gentle and Challengers series.  For Gentle and Challengers, there are the exact five same segments under each--Loosen Up, Stretch Out, Joint Freedom, Stretch, Balance & Breath.  The only difference is in the length--each Gentle segment is about 18-19 minutes, whereas each Challenger, 5-6 minutes.  The submenus simply let you choose the options for stringing the various segments together.  So, for Gentle, you have shorter routines of 18-37 minutes (1-2 segments) or longer of 54-90 minutes (3-5 segments) and for the Challengers, the short routines range 5-12 minutes (1-2 segments) with the long routines being 15-32 minutes (3-5 segments).  Finally, for the Meditation sub-menu, you have various options as well (With Quiet-With Music-Just the Songs-With Ocean Sound-With Chanting), but all of the guided meditations feature the same Balance & Breath segment followed by whatever meditation option is chosen.

With respect to the practices, they are okay.  There is focus on the breath, which I like, but no more formal pranayama (breathwork).  There is also plenty of stretching and joint mobility, great for warming up, but there's not much here that will be recognizable yoga postures, even as adapted for the chair.  Again, that's fine if that's what someone is looking for, but it doesn't really seem consistent with what was described on the DVD case.  If this was billed as an exercise routine for those with physical limitations only, I would not have purchased it, but it seems like that's the best audience for these routines.  Even so, I would still be somewhat hesitant to recommend the DVD--i.e., if you don't choose an-all sitting routine, the other routines have a lot of frequent up and down movement, which may not be ideal for some.

I'm still trying to decide whether to keep this DVD.  If I teach chair yoga in the future, there might be some things here I can use, but otherwise, this has not been a good fit for my needs.",1497225600,2,4214,4.88061797752809
