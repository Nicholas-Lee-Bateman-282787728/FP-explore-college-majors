3174711,5,B0017ON6R2,"My granddaughters, ages 4 and 6, love this video (as do my daughter and I).  It's a nice, sweet, slow-paced show (not all loud, noisy and soooo busy like some children's shows are). Love the music, and lessons in these shows too.  The show used to be on the Noggin (no longer called Noggin) channel some time ago (with 2 or 3 episodes for about a half-hour per show), but then it disappeared for a few years.  Now it's on the Sprout channel, and they only put on 1 fifteen minute episode, with lots of hostess (and puppet) talk before and after the show.  Seeing that, I was determined to get this video, and I'm glad I did.  All the characters and episodes that we loved and remembered are right on this video.  It runs about 85 minutes with back-to-back episodes (and no blabbing LOL).  There's also the ""Georgina the Giraffe"", and ""Giggles and Tickles"" DVD's being sold here at Amazon as well (which I also bought).  We're very happy with this DVD.  Thank you Amazon for carrying/selling it.  ;)",1348617600,,998,4.4944444444444445

3174713,4,B0017ON6R2,The video was fine. The hoops and false advertising of products you do not have turned me off Amazon for the future. Too old to go through garbage to find a nugget. I have better ways to spend my time and money. Wrote about this when the problems occurred. No one seems to have noticed. Just one example of administration and managemt grown to large to care. Apply for a government bail out.,1291766400,,391,4.36986301369863

The animation is wacky, in a comic style kind of way. It kept my toddler
entertained through the whole show. The music is quite catchy and the
voices is with a British accent. Great for young todllers 2-4 year olds.
My 2 yo daughter watches it again and again.
