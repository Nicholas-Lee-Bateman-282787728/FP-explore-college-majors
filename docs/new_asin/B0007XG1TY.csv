8053356,3,B0007XG1TY,"good installment of stories about the afterlife, and death and the bridge of conscienceness between them.

many of these stories have a medical backdrop (doctors and scientists trying to learn more about the supernatural state of the afterlife).

haven't watched all the episodes yet, will update this review soon..

recommend the following episodes:

""New Lease"" - two doctors have the ability to bring the dead back to life through molecular reorganization.  But when one of the doctors is killed by a mugger and reanimated, will the killer be brought to justice?",1282348800,3,565,5.164835164835165
