8258180,2,B0015ESZ98,"An agreeable time killer that mixes comedy and suspense, although the latter element is cut off short by an abrupt ending. Nice to see Joan Woodbury (""Brenda Starr"") in a starring role, albeit on Poverty Row (PRC). Print quality and sound are acceptable, but nothing more.",1240790400,,272,4.934782608695652
