8159037,5,B00004REQT,This intimate portrait gives a viewer an interesting insight to Jaclyn Smith's life. She really is a true class-act in television and a classic beauty. I have watched this tape over 10 times :),1089244800,2,193,4.705882352941177
8159038,5,B00004REQT,"This ""intimate portrait"" documentation of Jaclyn Smith is truly an outstanding collection and a must for all the fans of this beautiful woman.  She's somehow managed to survive it all--from being a superstar of the hit 70s tv series to being one of the most-sought-actresses in hollywood up until today--she's determined to remain soaring as Charlie's most durable Angel.
The always elegant and beautiful Jaclyn seems to managed to float high above the squabbling and double-edge gossip life in hollywood. She has managed her professional career shrewdly, exploiting ""Charlie's Angels"" as a career launching pad for her sky rocketing career--from being an actress and now a famous clothing designer. She seems to chosing her career steps carefully.
Her undisputed good looks certainly helped her secure sucess in modeling and television but this woman knows how to take care of god's given blessings and I guess, hollywood appreciate an actress who doesn't let success go to her head.
A truly remarkable woman. Beautiful, sexy, beautiful kids, soaring career, a loving husband, what more can you ask? Some people are really born lucky!
A must see!",994809600,6,1147,5.233695652173913
8159039,5,B00004REQT,"This video shows how a woman can look even better with age. Usually, you get remarks on how pretty she was in her prime. But here, from her earliest photos to her current interviews, you can not believe how lovely an older woman can get!
John Forsythe is wonderful, (and quite nostalgic-sounding, I must add) as the narrator for this angel who was in each and every episode of Charlies' Angels. Fellow angel Cheryl Ladd gives candid remarks on her mock jelousy of Jackie's looks (""I wanna slap her!"") as well as her her take-off (swings hair) on a typical angels episode.
And interviews with Robert Wagner,  whom she met before Charlie's Angels and  their subsequent reconnection is interesting. Getting to know her third husband on this video was a surprise, totally someone you would not associate with her. Not an actor or a filmmaker. But what a lucky man.
Jackie herself comes across as a real person, not only a beautiful star but someone you'd like to meet or live next door to. If you feel like doing that, pop this video on.
Especially poignant is seeing our heroine break down every time she greets her kids on video. Tells you that her favorite role all along is that of being a mother!",972086400,13,1197,4.588785046728972
