8448219,5,B004YDSMZY,Truly great dvd about two great generals on opposing sides of the civil war. This dvd shows us the lives of these two men and how they tried to win the war for their respective sides. In other words it showed us how very human they both were after all.,1448150400,,252,4.06

8448222,3,B004YDSMZY,"Ive always entertained a certain fascination with the American Civil War. Im not alone in that regard, which explains the ongoing output of documentaries, books and memorabilia associated with that terrible conflict.

Lets face it. There have been great achievements (Ken Burns The Civil War) and dozens of imitators. Finding a new angle to present this compelling subject matter is a challenge that is seldom successfully met.

As Civil War documentaries go, Lee & Grant isn't bad, but is so caught up in style that it overshadows the content. This is really too bad, because a detailed examination of the two most well-known generals from that war is a compelling topic.

Perhaps the most-often speculated theory about the American Civil War is the idea what if Robert E. Lee had chosen to remain loyal to the Union? Would the war have been shortened? Would it have taken as great a toll as it did?

Lee was arguably the greatest American general of the period. Its a pretty safe bet to say his decision to put State over Country resulted in more death and destruction than many people are comfortable to admit.

OK, so how could this subject not fail to measure up as a great documentary?

Because Ken Burns comprehensive exploration of the subject matter has made it virtually impossible for any subsequent film about the Civil War to be as highly regarded, director/producers are tempted, I think, to try to find a totally different approach to presenting this subject matter.

Fair enough, but the result, in LEE & GRANT, is overkill; style over substance.

For example, when filming an historian, I don't want to see a gigantic close-up of an oak tree in the foreground taking up two-thirds of the screen, with the dwarfed speaker sitting in the distant background. Such visual tricks are meaningless and distracting.

Similarly, when explaining Grants aversion to blood, the filmmakers tell how, as a boy, Grant was exposed to the slaughter of animals as part of the family business. This is accompanied by repeated shots of a little boys bare foot stepping in a pool of blood as he runs along. Surely this is (excuse the pun) overkill?

There is a wealth of information about Generals Lee and Grant that will be of value and interest to students and historians alike, but I, for one, don't like my facts overshadowed by attention-grabbing camera work and direction. Subject matter this good simply doesnt need it.",1397433600,2,2422,4.871046228710462
8448223,5,B004YDSMZY,"Good price and extremely well done ! An interesting and other perspective to the Civil War. Lets you realize that all men has low points in their life, but can still be very effective leaders.",1396224000,2,192,4.514285714285714
8448224,5,B004YDSMZY,"The HC (History Channel) has produced another ""winner"" in this film, Lee & Grant. First, of all, and in today's tech world, most important to most ""people,"" (aka HS students) it is NOT boring! :)
I used Lee & Grant for my CW Unit in my College Prep HS US History classes. It was a great visual aid for a compare and contrast ""study"" of the two major commanding generals and the major Civil War battles they were involved in.
I wish I could have purchased this in the ""streaming"" version instead of DVD, only for the fact that it will be stored and preserved safely in my teaching files. Regardless, it is worth your time and $ either way. Even if you are not the history ""buff,"" you will find the lives of these two generals very interesting and learning something new...",1372464000,5,771,4.398601398601398
8448225,3,B004YDSMZY,"For me the most important Civil War Battles....NOT COVERED did involve Lee and Grant. There was nothing on COLD
HARbOR, THE WILDERNESS, or Petersburg....a glaring oversight on an otherwise Good documentary. Grant's arrival in the East...had a larger impact then this documentary covered. Previous to Grant, Generals like McClellan would lose battles and run back to Washington. Grant advanced. Nothing like that was discussed in this documentary. Also Cold Harbor was very controversial. Again ""Silence"" from the history channel. Disappointing.",1337990400,2,544,5.8125
