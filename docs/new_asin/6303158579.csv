576143,5,6303158579,"I love this film. I do. For me, a long time Abbott and Costello fan, this is one of their funniest movie ever filmed. I grew up watching their films on sunday mornings after church. I've seen all their films, but this one for me, is one of the best. I don't want to give away my age, but let's just say that no longer a child, and not yet a senior, this film still makes me laugh out loud. All of them are funny; some of them are funnier than others. Some are just outright funnier; this is one of the latter. When I feel down and/or just need a laugh, this is one of the A&C films I watch. A&C Meet Frankenstein, Meet the Mummy, Hold that Ghost, Who Done It, Go to New Orleans, and Buck Privates are all my favorites to watch over and over.
See what happens when Abbott and Costello meet ""the killer"" and it isn't who you think it is. Costello plays a bell hop. Abbott portrays the hotel detective. Boris Karloff guest stars. This film is full of their routines and slapstick. You'll cheer for them. You'll tell them to run. You'll tell them to hide. You'll laugh with them and at them. This is an easy movie to like and will entertain, as well as provide an escape, if only for a little while. If you're an Abbott and Costello fan, or just a fan of comedy, this is a must-have for your video shelf. This one is funny.",1346803200,,1319,4.116279069767442

The police detectives arrive and begin the investigation. Angela visits Freddy and asks him to sign a statement. Then they have cocktails and a comic scene follows.

Then Freddy finds something in his closet; this leads to a comic disguise. The same thing is found in another closet. The police continue to question people. They try a trick of selling evidence. Freddy can prove his innocence if he becomes the next murder victim! Will the murderer fall for it? Will another body turn up? Freddy gets a call to go to the caverns alone at night and bring the evidence. A mysterious stranger wants the evidence of the handkerchief.

All the guests are assembled in a room for the ending. The questioning reveals the actual murderer for a surprise ending. The reason was to cover up a blackmail scheme.

576146,3,6303158579,"A very good murder mystery.  However, this is not the funniest performance Abbott & Costello put on.  One of the better stories for an Abbott & Costello movie.  This movie reminds me much of ""Clue"" and has it's similarities to the Pink Panther's ""Shot In The Dark"".  Overall this is a fine movie for murder mystery fans but if you're looking for laughs there aren't as many in this one.

A famous lawyer gets kills and the evidence points to Freddie and as Casey tries to help, Freddie gets into worse trouble. The Swami (Karloff) tries to hypnotize Freddie into killing himself but with his subnormal mentality Freddie can't be hypnotize - at one point Freddie is ask how he want to die and he responds ""old age."" Finally Freddie is lured to the Lost Caverns and finally chases the real killer back to the hotel.
The movie has lots of laughs with dead bodies turning up and moving around on Freddie. Seeing Lou dress up, as a hotel maid is a sight one must see. Karloff's main scene is when he tries to hypnotize Freddie - his part is not large but effective.",1030924800,,831,4.509933774834437

Trivia (from imdb.com): This was originally intended as a vehicle for Bob Hope (1903-2003). After the huge success of ""ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN"" (1948), Universal-International wanted another thrill comedy with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello so the script was rewritten for them. Oddly enough, the role played by Boris Karloff was originally written for a woman.",947721600,,2084,6.314606741573034

7839424,3,6303158579,"I wouldn't want to accuse Universal-International of ""stunt casting"", but one does get the feeling Boris Karloff's sole purpose for appearing in this movie was the marquee value of his name attached to it. Given his actual role in the movie--a role by some reports that was originally supposed to be played by a woman--it's kind of hard to argue that point.

Karloff is only a minor player in the overall scheme of things--and perhaps Boris' reasons for taking the part was his way of trying to make up for not playing the part of the ""Frankenstein Monster"" in Abbott and Costello's legendary first ""Meet"" picture.

In any event, as I've said elsewhere, this film was produced during that time period when A & C's feature films were becoming very hit or miss. There are some funny scenes--particularly amusing was when the cops & Bud think Lou has been poisoned & Bud proceeds to pour a whole bunch of solutions down Costello's throat.

Still, this film is very heavy on plot & seemingly light on Abbott and Costello action. There are some intermittent chuckles throughout, but I would say this film pales badly when compared to the ""Meet Frankenstein"" film--but maybe it's not fair to compare the 2.

Now that I think about it, most of the ""Meet"" pictures, aside from the first were pretty underwhelming & this is coming from a longtime Abbott and Costello fan.

3 stars",1423958400,,1371,4.7196652719665275
