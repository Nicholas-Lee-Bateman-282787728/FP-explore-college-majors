I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. This is a low budget UK drama/thriller about a woman who murders her husband and lives to regret it. It is a self-contained kind of film which centers mainly on the very likeable lead actress Maria Thomas. Despite the low budget, the story draws you in and there is particularly great sexual chemistry between the two lead actors. All in all, I'd say it was a pretty good thriller to watch on a rainy night. There is also a good twist at the end, which on second viewing, casts a completely different light on the characters. The only snag for me is that the DVD doesn't really have any extras apart from a photo gallery. A director's/actor's commentary would have been nice. Still, it is nicely packaged and overall it is a good film with strong performances.",1246233600,,941,4.508771929824562
8299436,3,B001ES6Y16,"Couple things to get out of the way real quick, this is labeled as a R1/R2 PAL title, with no mention of NTSC but it still says R1. It played in two of my computers but not in either BD player. The only part of the product description here that is correct is the ""nothing is as it seems"" part, otherwise skip the rest.

This is a very low-budget, low-key ""love-triangle"" kind of film taking place in the UK. The story centers around an unhappy wife as she plods through her loveless and uneventful life, and they go to great lengths to showcase this minimalism with her daily chores taking up minutes at a time with no dialogue. When there is dialogue, there is plenty to go around once the nosy neighbor finally shows his interest in this woman. Once things actually start moving, the editing and sound mixing try to create this suspenseful environment revolving around this woman's psyche. There are only five or six actors in the whole thing, and most of them have not been in anything before, so in that sense they were all believable this being a first-time outing here.

The violence always happens off screen, and the sensual scenes are subtle, as is the entire movie. It throws one realistic plot twist at you for the ending, but it was really the only outcome there could be with how the characters were written. No special features (the low-res photo gallery not included), not bad but not great, and if one enjoys piano key scores, this might be a decent overall watch for you.",1245801600,,1488,4.5278810408921935
