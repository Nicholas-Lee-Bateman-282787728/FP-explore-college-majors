8730035,5,B007TWBH4A,"This is a wonderful TRUE story of challenges faced and overcome, determination, grit and talent on the part of an amazing horsewoman and a particularly difficult horse. The original film footage kept by Jane Pohl is beautifully edited, and Jane's son is a superb and moving narrator. The interviews with people who knew Jane, worked with her and loved her, are expertly done - a great credit to a very fine film maker, Lou Buttino, whose documentaries have won many awards. Anyone who loves horses or wants to hear an inspiring story will love this film. Five stars and two thumbs up!",1515369600,,584,4.735294117647059

8730037,5,B007TWBH4A,"The Lady and the Outlaw horse is a beautifully told and visualized documentary about a missing chapter in showjumping history. The film tells us how Jane Pohl found the outlaw horse Fitzrada and worked with him for five years to bring out his natural jumping ability through patience, courage, and determination.  With great use of the song ""Unforgettable"" and stunning period images and film of horse culture from the forties and fifties, the film reminds us to value the skill and discipline of those early hunter jumpers.  We learn of the military background and training of early show jumpers, of the challenges Pohl faced as a woman rider, of her ability to show Fitzrada in both the hunters and jumpers, and of what it was like for her to be a free agent, showing her own horse and paying her own way. This is a must see for all riders and parents of riders today. We should be humbled by the partnership between Pohl and Fitzrada.",1357862400,4,937,4.63855421686747
