8746315,5,B019ZU6GQM,Bought for our family to view together. It kept the attention of our three teens.  Our state just legalized recreational use of marijuana and teens around here are thinking it must not be so bad.  The rise of use by 12 year olds and up has seen a dramatic increase in our area since legalization.  It is truly frightening how little kids and adults truly know about pot.  This DVD makes it VERY clear!,1513296000,2,401,4.378378378378378

8746322,5,B019ZU6GQM,"As a school board member told me recently, anyone preparing to vote on marijuana legalization should view this documentary first, just so they understand the full nature of the impact this drug has on our youth. Too few in the general public know what addiction counselors, educators and psychiatrists have witnessed over and over again.  The Other Side of Cannabis takes you on a journey experienced by one brave mom who decided to find out what had happened to her son, and through filming the testimonies of so many others across the United States, you realize the scope of the problem is large and tragic.  By the ending, you care so much about these kids who are trying to emerge from marijuana-induced psychosis, depression, anxiety, lack of motivation and addiction that you hope for a sequel to find out what they made of their lives.  They are super stars and the dedicated professionals helping them on their way are true heroes. Only suicide can end their dreams, and sadly, marijuana leaves that in its wake as well.",1451692800,4,1028,4.796610169491525
