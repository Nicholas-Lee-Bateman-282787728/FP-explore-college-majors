8560312,4,B00B0IBB8Q,"This DVD has provided me with a needed training tool.  In the absence of actual force-on-force training, this DVD does the job in providing various scenarios where the viewer can choose defense options based on the scenes as they run.  Analysis after each provides the viewer with additional information/training points.  Good product.",1434326400,,335,5.403846153846154
8560313,3,B00B0IBB8Q,"Surprised this is the only training dvd like this I could find. Quality could be much better (film quality, acting, scenarios, etc) but otherwise a great step in the right direction for decision making skills if you do carry. Be advised not good as a law enforcement tool (my mistake, should have looked into it a bit further. we don't have the option of walking away)",1404172800,,368,4.590909090909091
8560314,3,B00B0IBB8Q,"This DVD is TOO outdated. I'm law enforcement and I would NOT recommend this DVD for civilian to relay LEGAL STAND and justification. I CAN only recommend to use this DVD to practice the DRAW of your weapon, BUT NOT for legal stand.",1396742400,,232,4.4186046511627906
