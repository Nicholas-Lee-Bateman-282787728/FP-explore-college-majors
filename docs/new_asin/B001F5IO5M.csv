3564285,5,B001F5IO5M,Excellent adaptation by Ashton of the famous stories. Brings back memories of childhood and visits to the Royal Ballet from the time that the company occupied the reopened Covent Garden,1375228800,,185,5.2
3564286,5,B001F5IO5M,"Frederick Ashton has claim to be my favourite choreographer and whose work unfailingly exudes style, charm, poise and humour to name but few of its attractions. All of these are clearly exhibited in this marvellous choreographic confection with music arranged and orchestrated by John Lanchbery and which was first performed at the Royal Ballet in 1992.

The original tales themselves may be less familiar to the younger generation than previously as there is so much more competition for younger readers to be found on bookshelves today. In addition, their use of language is not so easily accessible to modern young readers. However, the ballet is another thing entirely being very modern with a very modern sense of humour which appeals right across all ages and generations as can be seen in the very enthusiastic audience's responses.

This ballet has proved to be very popular and features seven of the most familiar tales after the opening Mouse Waltz. The finale brings all the tales together in time-honoured fashion. Each tale is delightfully portrayed and equally delightfully danced by all concerned. The costumes and sets are of the same high calibre.

The camera work is totally sympathetic giving nice balance between detail and more general shots. The sound is presented in DTS surround and in stereo and faithfully captures the expert orchestral playing.

The disc is available as a multi-region issue and, as such, can be bought from abroad if it proves to be difficult to locate in the UK. I have found it to be a delightful addition to my library of Ashton ballets and am sure that it will give great pleasure to children of all ages, including those of more advanced age such as myself! This is, in my opinion, a clear 5 star issue and therefore well worth tracking down.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

I agree with the substance of your review--and take issue only with the word ""unfailingly"" in your first sentence. Ashton's ""Marguerite and Armand"" is, in my view, one abysmal exception that disqualifies use of the term; in that work, there is virtually nothing that is balletic: it may even be construed as an attempt (deliberate or otherwise) to destroy the very concept of it. But the work at hand is, as you aptly point out, quite happily the opposite. (U.S. review)",1341619200,3,2380,5.010126582278481

3564288,5,B001F5IO5M,"I had the good fortune to see this film when it first came out: when I was five years old.  Mum and Dad had already read many of the Beatrix Potter tales to me: this film made me only a stronger fan.  This film also inspired me to dance, at first as a five-year-old prancing round the living room and later as a student of dance, and all along it made me a huge fan of ballet.  May I humbly recommend parents, grandparents, or aunts and uncles give the gift of this film, the soundtrack, the books, and lots of space in the living room to the children in your lives?

And then, after you have shown the kids how nifty the ballet is in the film, won't you please take the little ones to a real ballet?  It's in 3-D!

Thankfully, everything except the ballet tickets can be found here on Amazon.com.",1263686400,7,797,4.176470588235294
3564289,5,B001F5IO5M,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER TAKEN THE TIME TO WRITE A REVIEW, (AS I AM MUCH TOO BUSY FOR SUCH THINGS) HOWEVER, I SIMPLY HAD TO TELL OTHERS THAT THIS IS TRULY A CLASSIC WORK OF ART, A JOY, AND A DELIGHT!  AGE DOESN'T MATTER (I AM 67 YRS OLD), YOU WILL BE THRILLED WITH THE ROYAL BALLET'S SUBLIME CHARACTERIZATIONS OF ALL OF MS. POTTER'S WHIMSICAL CREATURES!
NOW, YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY A WOMAN OF MY AGE WOULD BUY A DVD USUALLY INTENDED FOR CHILDREN...
WELL, IT'S THIS SIMPLE: I LOST MY PRECIOUS LITTLE DOG ""ANNIE"" ABOUT A YEAR AGO, (SHE WAS 15-1/2 YRS OLD), AND SINCE THEN, I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WHERE SHE IS AND HOW SHE IS.  WHEN I SAW FREDERICK ASHTON'S TALES OF BEATRIX POTTER WITH THE ROYAL BALLET DANCERS ON THE COVER OF THE DVD, I WAS INSTINCTIVELY DRAWN TO IT...  NOW, I KNOW WHERE ""ANNIE"" IS, AND WHAT SHE'S DOING, AND QUITE FRANKLY, I CAN'T WAIT TO JOIN HER THERE IN THE LAKE DISTRICT WITH ""JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK, AND ALL THE OTHERS...  THIS DVD IS TRULY A RARE TREASURE AND A ""MUST-HAVE"" IN ANYONE'S COLLECTION.",1260576000,17,1023,4.3125
3564290,5,B001F5IO5M,"I first saw it and loooooovvvvvveeee it!!! It's very cutie animal costume dancers.  It's my favorite famous author of Beatrix Potter.  I'm truly fan of author since in my childhood.  Also, I was ballet dancer too.",1255910400,3,213,4.861111111111111
8301034,5,B001F5IO5M,"I had seen a version of this ballet over 40 years ago, and was completely charmed then. Something brought it to mind, so I ordered a DVD to share with my husband, who is NOT a ballet fan. This, however, he enjoyed. The costumes are absolutely amazing, the best 3D renditions of Beatrix Potter's paintings that I can imagine. I was also very impressed with the dancers' ability to mimic some of the little ""mannerisms"" that bring each type of creature to life. I highly recommend this.",1482105600,,484,4.574712643678161

8301037,5,B001F5IO5M,"My 3 year old granddaughter and I love this DVD.  All of the original music is beautiful and charming, the dancing is excellent and the costumes are perfect.  The dancers look like the Beatrix Potter characters come alive.  Our favorite to watch is Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the gentleman frog who struggles with a large trout and survives to tell about it.  The DVD inspired us so much, we are now reading all of Beatrix Potter's stories, and then we find it so amusing to watch the dancers perform each story.  I only wish there were more DVDs like this one. It is truly one-of-a-kind.  It is fantastic and I would recommend it for anyone who loves dance, or has a child/grandchild of any age who loves dance.",1463011200,,704,4.503937007874016
