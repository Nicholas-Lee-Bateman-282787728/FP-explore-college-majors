2493058,5,B000E5N6NO,"This video sends chills through my body when I watch it.  It shows Michael at his best and in the prime of his leaping days.  This video is a motivation to me, I try to put it on every morning when I wake up.  I strongly reccomend this video.",1045699200,,242,3.8979591836734695
2493059,5,B000E5N6NO,"Airtime came out after the Bulls second championship, during a time when Jordan was being touted as the greatest player that ever was just preceding the final season before his first retirement. What is captured here is the last of the youthful Jordan who beat you with speed because he didn't have to out think you. This video is only second to Micheal Jordan's playground in capturing the athletic marvel that Air Jordan possessed. Whether you are a basketball -or- Jordan enthusiast or impressed by the things Micheal Jordan could and did do on the court, I recommend this video. The people at NBA Entertainment packaged it so that it is not some romp for enthusiasts only. Quite entertaining. Expect to see Micheal Jackson, as well! Hey, maybe that works for you, eh 8-)",977356800,,774,4.7835820895522385

8106027,5,B000E5N6NO,"Michael Jordan: Air Time takes a closer look on the man behind the legend. This video takes us into the journey of his life - on and off the court - during time the Chicago Bulls won the back-to-back NBA championship in 1991 and 1992 (when this video was released) and as part of the Team USA a.k.a Dream Team when NBA superstar took part in the '92 Barcelona Olympics.

Watching this video provides the viewer an insight on the life of the Greatest Of All Time in the NBA during a period when Michael Jordan has become the most recognized celebrity in the world. It takes a look on how he deals the situation as the media can't get enough of him as well as the controversies that goes along with it like his allegedly ""gambling problem"" and the negative points provided by Sam Smith's The Jordan Rules with regards to how he deals with his teammates through his love for gold. In addition to that,we also get to relive great moments during the Bulls' championship run like spectacular plays on court and interviews that were conducted during these moments.",1410825600,,1057,4.534031413612565
