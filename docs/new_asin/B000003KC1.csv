7903087,3,B000003KC1,"Coast to Coast is an Okay movie. Trucker Flick with a Cool GMC General Sleeper truck, mediocre acting and actors. silly plot. Robert Blake the Murderer is in it. I just got the movie at a cheap price originally before the whole blake thing because of te GMC truck in it. It's no Smokey and The Bandit and Certainly not Convoy. Yet still fun to watch. I guess I hate romantic Comedies.",1293667200,,384,4.347222222222222
7903088,5,B000003KC1,"I remember seeing this movie as a youngster on HBO and watching it again and again - completely mesmorized by the chemistry between hard luck cowboy (turned truck driver)Robert Blake, and the flakey, lunatic character played by Diane Cannon.

It was years before I was able to find it on VHS, and I treasure my copy!  Not only did Blake have a hard packed, sexy physique at the time, Cannon was as beautiful as usual.

It's funny, if not downright silly sometimes, but it's a great Saturday night diversion with an unbeatable Country-Western soundtrack, featuring Johnny Lee's ""Pickin' Up Strangers.""

Highly recommended!",1097452800,,621,5.0588235294117645

A down on his luck trucker, has more than his share of bad luck and then he meets  Cannon and it goes south from there !  But, after intial clashes and a few twists and turns, you can feel the sexual tension building and will no doubt feel some of it in your own pulse.  Cannon is a very sexy lady.  If you like to see the good guys win one for a change, you will leave this movie with a warm feeling inside and a smile that lasts the rest of the evening when you think over some of the scenes.  The soundtrack is EXCELLENT !!!!  I loved it.",1075852800,,626,3.96
