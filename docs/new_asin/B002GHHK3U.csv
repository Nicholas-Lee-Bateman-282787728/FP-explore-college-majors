3924741,5,B002GHHK3U,"I loved this movie! It was unexpectedly exciting. Beware! It is very different and a little slick. I had no idea what to expect. The trailers were very misleading (thankfully). Usually too much of a movie is given away in the trailer and I usually decide not to see it but I'm glad I went ahead to see this one. This movie was quirky, had a lot of twists and turns, a lot of stereotypical ethnic characters, introduced me to a lot of new actors (Wood Harris and fine-ass Omari Hardwick!) and had a surprise ending. It kept me engaged until the very end. I've seen it three times and I have recommended it to all of my movie friends.",1261267200,7,632,4.275

I put mine in the trash can.  Too bad the description of story is rated a low class liberial. Not a family movie..

Find your FF button and just get to the, thank-goodness, brief shootout and weak ending. Summery: Story - stereotypic. Acting - what acting. Backdrop - delivery truck and apartment.

3924762,5,B002GHHK3U,"Black comedy is a literary form of comedy that employs both farce and a morbid sense of humor while making a point through the use of action comedy. In this case a passage from the Bible is literally thrown into your face: Blessed are those who hear the Word of God and keep it. When Shavoo rises from the floor and views the carnage from the gunfight over the cocaine his words of advice to his dead friend return to haunt him. Knowing what to do and being able to do it are quite different. Shavoo has learned his lesson but the other two survivors still don't understand. After Shavoo walks out of the room and hopefully shakes off this way of life, the other two rise off the floor but their reactions are different. The driver, Leo, has taken the money while Jesus, the street dealer, directs his woman to gather the drugs off the floor before the police arrive. Leo and Jesus simply aren't ready to put it aside. This is a far better film than people realize. It does indeed like an action comedy but as the film progresses it dawns on the audience there is nothing funny about it. Shavoo did something about it. Leo and Jesus are now far more deeply involved in it. While there was nothing lewd in it, I just don't think kids would understand. Black comedy is intended to be frightening. It has a point to make. In this circumstance what happens to people who are foolish and greedy in this sort of world. It consumes them..",1437436800,,1431,4.383458646616542

3924784,4,B002GHHK3U,"Too many people expect blockbuster visuals or plots with a decent or low budget movie. Like it was good for what it was. Straight to DVD movies aren't to be critized on the same level as million dollar budgets. I'm not too critical either but they're independent for a reason. Either finances, star power or distribution. And it was actually a pretty decent movie. I found it on BET & thought ""Oh no, I'm changing the channel"" but Mike Epps humor caught me before I could change the channel. Next thing I know I was invested in this movie & didn't want to change the channel. Then I had to look it up to see if I can get it on Netflix or Amazon Prime to stream it since BET blocks curse words & that sort, I'd rather watch the movie without the bleeps &/or fake curse words. So if you're watching it on Amazon or DVD there should be little to complain about. It had a little funny spin to it so it wasn't dry at all. Add the black star power, you cant hate on that. And OMG Omari Hardwick is so fine! That alone is a great reason to watch the movie. LOL But seriously, decent plot & great actors (Mos Def, Donald Faison, Wood Harris, Darius McCray & more), you cant complain too much. I would definitely recommend to watch this one. Those that think they are Roger Ebert in reviewing movies might take this film too seriously. But if you're just looking for a couple of hours to watch something new that's not too serious, good plot & has some action. I'd say check it out. Also great to see it was associated with Benny Boom. He was/is a big time music video director. So I'm glad he's branching out. And this movie was a great start. I hope to see more films like this. Wish the ending was a little bit more played out. But it was good none the least. And I would watch it again.",1388361600,,1781,4.19533527696793

The movie wasn't bad and it wasn't good, its one of those movies that you might watch and after the movie was done, you cant remember what it was about.  I gave it two stars only because of the girl thats in the movie, (the one on the cover) she wasn't funny but she was the eye candy for the movie and she did her job.

3924800,4,B002GHHK3U,They advertised this move as another over the top Soul Plane type comedy (God knows why)but its not that kind of comedy. In fact this was a dark comedy with sharp humor with a bit of pulp fiction (the genre not the movie) in it. Whoever developed the marketing strategy for this movie should have given the urban community a little more credit for having an ability to digest a multilayerd storyline instead of promoting this as something that it wasn't . Those expecting a slap stick comedy were disappointed and those (like myself) who would have appeciated something different from an all black cast probably never gave it a chance.,1290643200,,635,4.72972972972973

3924803,2,B002GHHK3U,"The previews and Amazon description of this movie suggest that this is a comedy, and that the stars are Donald Faison and Mos Def.  I wish.  Although Faison's character is responsible for setting the sequence of events in motion, he's definitely not a main character.  This is really a Mike Epps movie.  As for Mos Def, it seems like the director wanted him in the movie but didn't have a part for him to play.  So although Def is featured prominently in the previews, his character is inconsequential and he's on screen for less than 10 minutes.

As for the movie itself, while there are some jokes, there aren't enough to make it a comedy.  And as a crime drama, the plot is obvious, boring, and predictable.  In fact, if you saw the extended preview, that actually is the entire movie--including the best jokes and the climax.

Take a pass on this movie that couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a crime drama and ended up doing nothing well.",1268870400,2,955,4.473988439306359
