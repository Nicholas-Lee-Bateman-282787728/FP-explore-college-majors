7954999,3,B00005UQ7G,"I noticed many reviewers refer to this flick as Amazing, Great and the Best Ever.  I'm not sure about that.  It does have good fight scenes from the start to finish, an acceptable plot and the picture quality and choreograpy was good.  But certainly not a 4 or 5 star performance!!  Yeah I would recommend it, but don't go into it with your hopes too high, you could fall kinda hard!!",1149465600,,384,4.366197183098592

The fight chorography is great sometimes ecsousting just watching, one fight last like 15 minutes its great oh and Sammo Hung does have a couple fights,one is just awsome like the other reviewer mentioned with the spears. I do recommend this one.",1082937600,,332,4.741379310344827
7955001,5,B00005UQ7G,"Ground Zero and the Wu-Tang Clan have done it again!  This movie is an old school kung fu classic.  Starring Tung Wei, Lee Hoi Sam and Samo Hung this little winner is full of chop sockey fun from start to finish.  Lots of training scenes featuring wing chun vs five animal shaolin, lama kung fu and a crazy fight with Samo Hung vs a bad guy with double spears!  All the above plus a really cute chick make this dvd a must have for real kung fu fans.  Buy it now!",1027123200,,462,4.032967032967033
