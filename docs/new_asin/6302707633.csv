I don't know enough about actual kung-fu to say weather or not the kung-fu was good, but the acrobatics were excellent and the diolouge was so funny that I peed my pants like: ""oh we were helpless before them, like little goats.....before a tiger"", or ""You'd better not fight with me, I'm pretty tough stuff!"" I think that there was a total of ten minutes acting and diologe in the movie, and the rest of course was KUNG FU FIGHTING!! And you know what? There was actually some intentional humor thrown in that worked well with the movie. I don't think this movie won any ocsars, but it was funny none the less. Because it was ""so bad, it's funny,"" I wasen't sure if I should give this a very good or very bad rating, so I comprimised and give it a 2.5 stars.",999388800,,835,4.32484076433121

7830204,4,6302707633,"This is one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen, but it is an joy to watch!!  There are simply gobs of scenes that you will never expect, but they also never disappoint!  There probably isn't even a three or four minute gap between each fighting scene, but you will actually be happy because each action scene manages to out-do the previous one.  This is far from a movie you watch for the plot or for realism.  In fact, there is hardly a story here at all, but it does have just enough continuity to connect each fight scene (which were clearly all organized before the plot; it appears to me that they merely came up with a loose plot just so that they could put all the fight scenes into one movie).

In the end, out of quite a few ""underground, 'B rate,' kung-fu movies"" I have seen, this one is BY FAR, leagues ahead of the rest!  Even Dragon Lee's other films don't hold their own to this one.  If you watch one kung-fu movie in your life--make it ""Martial Monks of the Shaolin Temple!!!!""

Plus, this movie has maybe the very best ending line of dialogue of all time.  I will not spoil it for you...",1453075200,,1117,4.2559241706161135

7830208,4,6302707633,"I was scourging all over the internets for this and a couple more of filmmaker Godfrey Ho's classic kickups and finally found a few at bargain prices at good ol' Amazon.
The usual kung-fu formula here, an Abbott from the Shaolin Temple has been murdered and one of the disciples must exact revenge and goes on a lil adventure along they way and possibly gets a girlfriend. Bruce Lee look alike Dragon Lee gives a decent performance as the Shaolin master seeking revenge but playing a street hustler in disguise. Hwang Jang Lee aka Silver Fox is the usual villain with the feet from hell, quickly disposing anyone that opposes him.
Action and comedy blend is the usual style of Mr. Ho and there is a lot of the expected combined with hilarious dubbing and voice acting. Don't expect fine scripting writing or Oscar worthy acting here' it's all chop socky action and there is a scene with a guy with a big ass sword and he was eating chicken and had the meat all over his beard, gross and funny at the same time!!!
Look my taste in films aren't like everyone else's and don't expect this flick to be some high class action/comedy kung-fu extravaganza, it's low budget to say the least. My only gripe is that the releasing studio could have done better with the DVD release and sharpen it up audio/video wise. It looks like they just sloppily copied it over to DVD from either VHS or Betamax and had a generic menu with no features. But for the price I can't complain and it's low budget Godfrey Ho at it's best. Enjoy it for what it is... BTW the ""Lick It"" is from a scene where Silver Fox captures Dragon and forces him to lick his shoes",1314403200,,1636,4.420529801324503

7830211,4,6302707633,"If you get as much of a kick out of these movies as I do, and I mean for all the wrong reasons, like the poorly-dubbed dialogue, the embarrassingly over-wrought characterizations, the endless Kung-Fu choreography, and the downright dismal production values, then put this one on your list. It's really good for a laugh. Then get ready for a bit of a surprise. Because despite all the 'wrong reasons' its better than most. Dragon Lee has a fairly effective 'Jackie Chan' persona-won-choppa, including a pretty good funny-man bit. And for all you legions of female Kung-Fu fanatics, he's built like an advanced body builder - fly-weight division, of course.
Needles to say it's full of the usual tricks and gadgets and the story is just a seemingly endless chain of revenge killings until he works his way up to the top man. Dare I give away the ending? It's not quite what you might expect...  And, yes, there is a restaurant scene where the owner is a timid little dork with a silly squeaky voice.",1015027200,3,997,4.6971428571428575
