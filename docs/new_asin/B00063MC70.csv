Half of her routine consisted of her imitating her drunk family members at a get together.  It got real lame real quick and has been done many times Darrel Heath was surprisingly lame as well.  He suffers from the same dilema as Shepherd in staying with the same long joke about his old school pimp uncle even though it's not working with the crowd.  You mat remember Heath in Don't Be A Menance To Society While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood.  He played the guy who couldn't adjust to being out of prison.  Now that's comedy!!  Juan Villareal is the standout in this DVD.  He also appeared in Cedric The Entertainers, Starting Line Up.  What I liked about his performance is that it's fresh.  He's not doing the same jokes from previous perfomances.  You shows that he's keeping up with his craft and really attempting to be big in Stand Up Comedy and in films.  Watch out for this guy.  He's gonna be great!",1120003200,,1053,4.439790575916231
