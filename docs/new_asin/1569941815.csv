7797151,5,1569941815,"When Bradbury was 12, a magician, Mr. Electrico, told him to ""live forever,"" and Bradbury thought that was a great idea.  The video interview was filmed when he was about to celebrate his 75th birthday (he was born in 1920), so it is not a new interview; however, Bradbury's wit is amazingly sharp, and his stories and messages are as relevant today as they were over 50 years ago.
Included in the video are excerpts from some of Bradbury's short stories (part of The Ray Bradbury Theater that aired in the mid-'80's).  I remember watching the program when I was younger, but back then I hadn't yet started reading Bradbury's novels.  I can honestly say that Ray Bradbury is my favorite contemporary author.  He IS an American icon.  His stories about small-town life are universal.  He's an amazing writer, and this video offers an enlightening view into Bradbury's world.",1062374400,6,873,4.825503355704698
