2463832,1,B000CFX7DU,"Every so often people trot out this Barbra Streisand ""porno"" tape. For once and for all IT IS NOT BABS.

The footage is a sloppy, grainy black & white mess. The DVD has a bar blocking out any view of genital nudity and...

IT IS NOT BABS!

The woman is actually a well known Jewish porn actress from the late 70s/early 80s named Tasha Vous.

The other notorious film here: the Go-Go's backstage ""porno"" consists of a drunken and drugged out, bleary eyed Belinda Carlisle and a sweaty Kathy Valentine trying unsuccessfully to get some girl fan to give one of their roadies head. She will only jack him off, he can't get hard and all Carlisle does is yack, yack, yack. Carlisle, Valentine or the girl fan don't get naked and really nothing happens.

Once again you will not find any hardcore pornography or clear nude shots here.",1140134400,6,827,4.523489932885906
2463833,5,B000CFX7DU,"I must tell you, if you want to see a vintage local New York adult cable show, this volume is for you. Midnight Blue was a leased access program on Manhattan Cable TV's Channel J back in the `70's. Al Goldstein and Alex Bennett hosted the program and to this day, these men are my heroes of New York cable porn, period. The segments in the volume are pure gems and the commercials are out of sight.

I was very disappointed with the first volume, The Deep Throat Collection, because of the annoying factoids popping up on the screen, thus, ruining the entire DVD itself.

I am very happy to report that the pop ups are now an extra. That way you can disable it and finally enjoy the show in the clear. Honestly, New York After Midnight and Blue Underground should redo and reissue the first volume because of that problem.

I am disappointed of the lack of the show open of each segment. Volume 1, The Deep Throat Collection, added the original 1975 - 1976 opens to each of the show segments, but this volume didn't and they should because that was a part of Midnight Blue as well. Remember the ""Late Late Blue?"" I still have the open on tape from 1982.

I hope they will correct it in future sets.

Midnight Blue is a must buy to adult entertainment fans!!!

Something old? Something new? Something very little Midnight Blue...",1138665600,9,1328,4.444444444444445
2463834,5,B000CFX7DU,"Proof that porn chic of the 70s and 80s attracted strange folks to the light, here's Al Goldstein landing interviews with Arhunld, OJ and Tiny Tim.  OJ gets interviewed at the Hookers Ball.

Plus there are early glimpses of Penn and Teller before they became Vegas bigwigs. And a visit with the great R. Crumb.

And Al pulls out  the stops with clips from the infamous Go-Gos video. The guy in this film wishes his lips were sealed.

This isn't your mother's Entertainment Tonight show. Plus more of Al's amazing adult entertainment ads.",1137801600,5,537,4.731182795698925

8098904,1,B000CFX7DU,"On the odd chance that you're buying this for the interview with Tiny Tim, all I can say is don't! You can find the exact same interview elsewhere on the internet. I purchased this thinking there would be more to the interview (as the version currently viewable on the internet cuts out in the middle of a sentence), but I was disappointed to find the same one here.",1346889600,,366,4.397058823529412
8098905,1,B000CFX7DU,"if your looking for real honesty to GOD pornography
you had better chose another DVD because this one does not provide it
alot of AL GOLDSTEIN taking about it but never doing ""IT""
also a very grainy shot of is that really barbara striestand?
it looks like her nose but that's about it",1324771200,3,284,4.377358490566038
8098906,2,B000CFX7DU,"If your cup of tea is Al Goldstein interviewing Penn&Teller, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Al Lewis and Tiny Tim then by all means buy this.  There must be some historical significance here somewhere.  The only interview that was even close to watchable was that with Russ Meyers. The one with R. Crumb, which could have been interesting, devolves into a discussion of his masturbatory fantasies.  Yeech.  Unless you're into that sort of thing.  The Tiny Tim interview is especially disturbing as he is a ""moral"" christian with some wacked ideas about what constitutes human sexual relationships.  And watching O J Simpson sends shivers up the spine.  He seemed like such a nice guy.

The real ""come-on"" here is the alleged Barbara Streisand porn movie that is so out of focus and grainy it is impossible to identify the ""actress"", and the Rob Lowe porn movie most of which is a male butt humping someone, but wherein you actually see an erection.  Is it Rob Lowe's?  Who knows.  Who cares.

A good deal of what you'd want to see in this dvd is censored, such as the infamous Go-Go's bathroom masturbatory sequence which features a potted Belinda Carlisle weaving back and forth and essentially being too drunk to do anything but weave back and forth and attempt to direct the ""action""....if you can call a roadie masturbating whilst sitting on a toilet (censored, of course) action.

Of course, this dvd comes complete with escort service ads.  They may actually be the best sex scenes in the entire video.",1144972800,7,1500,4.8313725490196076
8098907,5,B000CFX7DU,"Lots of famous celebrities are aired on this show O.J. Simpson. You also get to see Arnold Schwarzenegger posing with a nude woman. Plus Jack Nicklson, Donald Trump, Howard Stern, Larry Flynt and many more famous people. But what I really love seeing is the naked women in this dvd.",1141948800,2,282,4.66
