8660044,3,B00KMIO71S,"I checked out this particular offering from 'Bound Heat' productions based primarily on its' price point. Anyone looking to sample what the Bound Heat product line has to offer has undoubtedly noticed that these can be remarkably expensive little skin shows - for some reason ""Sold At Dawn"" had a price tag that wasn't quite so outrageous. I've watched a few of the B.H. discs now and I can sorta see where their appeal lies, but I am perplexed as to why they command such steep prices when there is so much similar fare available for a fraction of the cost.

Regardless - I found ""Sold At Dawn"" to be an amusing watch - totally typical of the Bound Heat formula - but actually a little goofy in some of its' elements. The premise of the tale involves a 'widow' living in a lovely rustic cabin who is actually a white slaver and the 3 'slave' girls she has hidden in her basement 'cavern' awaiting sale to some nebulous clients somewhere.  As the 'film' opens the trio of captured girls are being chastised by the lone widow for trying to escape and all are given a nice topless lashing to force them to reveal who the 'ring-leader' of the escape attempt was.  The 'widow' actually looks to be only in her mid-twenties, a gorgeous blond!, who goes thru the whole show wearing a pair of massive army combat boots - a charming Eastern European touch!

A hallmark of the Bound Heat franchise is the use of, apparently, the same 'cavern' set in many films and the concept that: girls are sexy when they are 'forced to work' without clothes on.  In several (other) B.H. flix the women are made to do mining type jobs in the underground realm, with many scenes of their sweat-sheened naked bodies hauling rocks around - BUT - in ""Sold At Dawn"" FIREWOOD appears to be the preferred commodity, and the viewer is 'treated' to extensive coverage of the errant girls being 'punished' via naked log sawing and wood splitting activities in the subterranean lair!

Of course 'all work and no play..."" isn't good for a soft core sex flik - so the ladies are brought up from the depths to 'amuse' their captor with some sapphic action while she eats a leisurely meal of boiled root vegetables. Ultimately, another female slave dealer arrives on the scene to pick up the 'merchandise' - the 3 girls get 'oiled up' (another popular icon of the B.H. universe!), are drugged into unconsciousness, and carted off to some ignominious fate of sexual servitude. Roll credits.

What I noted about THIS particular (2010) production was: that it had a female Director (no sign of franchise originator Lloyd Simandl in the ceditis!) - featured NO males in the plot - and showed a little more graphic sexual action than other B.H. flix I've seen.  Generally the B.H. line provides a LOT of 'full' female nudity (its' primary selling point I would image!) with really cute young Czech gurlz - but they mostly keep their legs closed & the pubic triangle is about as 'daring' as it gets.  ""Sold At Dawn"" provides a few fairly hot lesbian scenes where things 'open up' a little and the camera gets right in there.  Beyond that it's all basically soft core girl/girl action. Familiar territory! - BUT - that seems to be 'what sells' with this particular production company.  If you enjoy seeing naked girls splitting logs and making sawdust - this one cud B 'right up your alley'!  Fullscreen mode - super clear picture quality - funky English lang. dub - no extras.

Please also note: this is a Euro Region 2 PAL format disc and requires a 'region free' DVD player to watch, if you are not a resident of the parent zone.",1420761600,,3587,4.5859375
