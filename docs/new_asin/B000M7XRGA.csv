2726160,5,B000M7XRGA,"Premium is one of the BEST movies I have seen to date. The story is relational to everyones lives in so many ways! Pete is a visionary and the potrayal of what happens is so on point to the lives of every human being. You will find yourself looking inward and remembering right along with Cool and Charlie. This is as Chatmon calls a REAL ""New Wave in American Cinema"" If this is the beginning, than I know we have the Next Great director on our hands. Not to mention the talent and range portrayed by Missick and Saldana. Be on the lookout for these ""A"" listers!!",1173398400,6,564,4.280373831775701
2726161,5,B000M7XRGA,"Kudos to the filmmaker and his multi-talented cast for putting together one of the most refreshing films I've seen in a long time!  It's not often that we get to appreciate the organic, home-grown goodness of a truly original script. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the lead characters, Charli and Cool (Zoe Saldana & Dorian Missick), as well as the rest of this loveable cast.  It was nice to see familiar faces like Frankie Faison and Hill Harper play such original characters, very different from their previous films.  I especially appreciate Chatmon's talent for writing clever dialogue (which is extremely funny too) and his dedication to the authenticity of the human spirit.

The experiences of these characters hits very close to home for many people, including myself. But to see it portrayed on screen helps to remind one of the beauty of our everyday lives.  This is the perfect romantic comedy/contemporary-coming-of-age story, enjoyable for all audiences, and it definitely leaves me hoping for a sequel!",1173398400,3,1025,5.150602409638554
2726162,5,B000M7XRGA,"I believe Chatmon when he says Double7Films is making a new wave in American cinema. Chatmon has made a socially aware yet sensitive and universal story with no strings attached. The filmmaking is spot on and the humor is witty. The characters are unique and multidimensional. In the end, you can't really ask much more of a film. And this is only Chatmon's first feature? Not a film to miss.",1173312000,3,392,4.614285714285714
2726163,3,B000M7XRGA,"I watched this at the American Black Film Festival in Miami last year and found it quite an enjoyable experience.

It was certainly refreshing to see black characters not playing the fool or indulging in the usual stereotypical fare for a dumbed down audience. However, I felt it didn't really have anything particularly new or insightful to say and is the kind of movie you're glad you've seen but won't really linger long as a memorable movie moment.

Having said that, it's a welcome addition to the much needed diversity in black film entertainment.",1173312000,,553,4.872340425531915
2726164,5,B000M7XRGA,"I had the pleasure of viewing this film with Pete and another NYU buddy.  To say the least, I was blown away.  Cool's character was complex...funny, engaging, but struggling and sensitive.  The love triangle between Cool, Zoe's and Hill's character were compelling and rich.  The scene where Cool crahses their dinner was CLASSIC!

Love is messy, and it's also so achingly simple. This film shows the wide range of emotions felt when you deal with love.  And beyond that, Cool struggles with his identity, and to see that run through the entire film was great.

See this film. Trust me when I say that Pete Chatmon will be at an Academy Awards ceremony VERY soon. :)",1173052800,4,666,4.689655172413793
2726165,4,B000M7XRGA,"Premium was one of the best films I saw last year.

In a climate of formulaic plots and predictable storylines, I found Chatmon's writing to be authentic and CREATIVE, two elements often missing in today's cinema. I enjoyed the perfomances of the actors, especially Zoe Saldana. I don't think I have ever been moved by any of her performances until seeing Premium. I really liked her and belived her and I attribute that to direction, once again, Chatmon bringing something fresh to the screen. Dorian Missick was textured and Hil Harper, tangible.

I love seeing people of color on screen with purpose and presence. This film delivers that for me and I will buy it to have it alongside the other credible films in my library.",1172880000,3,726,4.753968253968254
2726166,5,B000M7XRGA,"I'm constantly on the lookout for richly developed characters and sincere storytelling, and if you feel the same way, you'll be delighted by Pete Chatmon's PREMIUM. There is a ton of heart in this film. It made me laugh, but it also made me think - about relationships, about stereotypes, about the decisions we make and how they shape the course of our lives. This is not a typical ""black film"" with an exclusive audience - its universal themes apply to everyone. Great performances by all the actors, including Dorian Missick and Zoe Saldana, enhance what was already a very entertaining and well-written script. Props to Chatmon, who beat the odds to make this touching film, despite limited resources and all the obstacles that accompany independent filmmaking! Whether you are an aspiring artist struggling to make your own creative visions into a reality, or simply maneuvering through life's ongoing issues of love and longing, you will gain something from watching PREMIUM.",1172793600,3,981,5.099378881987578
2726167,5,B000M7XRGA,"If you're looking for options in black cinema, this is for you.  If you're looking for a solid love story, this for you.  If you've been missing characters that you can relate to, this is for you.  PREMIUM offers up a twenty something love story built on a familiar foundation to many folks...that one relationship that changes us forever.  I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention the appealing sarcasm and dry humor that add to the experience.  I thoroughly enjoy this movie more each time I see it and enthusiastically recommmend it to folks of all ages and walks of life.",1172707200,4,573,4.578431372549019
2726168,5,B000M7XRGA,"I saw an advanced screening of this film in NYC.  It was great.  The story is sweet, charming and funny.  Dorian Missick is charming and charismatic as ""Cool"" and the supporting cast is supurb as well.  Pete Chatmon, who wrote and directed it is going to be a superstar!~",1172707200,6,271,4.469387755102041
2726169,1,B000M7XRGA,Oh now I get why they named the movie Premium... cause the guys a filling station attendant... ok... and why was thiy movie EVER made... just BAD!,1236902400,,146,4.444444444444445
2726170,5,B000M7XRGA,I saw this movie on HBO yesterday and it was great!  I just had to buy my own copy on amazon.  This is a wonderful love story that everyone can relate to.  The one who got away and possibly may still be with later in life.  It reminded of my own experiences.,1232323200,,258,3.9038461538461537
2726171,5,B000M7XRGA,"This is a story about a guy trying to found out who he really is, with a love story twist.  I was really impressed by the actor playing the lead character.  I had never seen any of his work , but his portrayal of an out-of-work actor was engaging and realistic.  There is a lot of meat to the script; and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Let me not fail to mention as well, that actor Hill Harper had a small part in the film that was equally compelling.",1229904000,,446,4.045454545454546
2726172,2,B000M7XRGA,"I absolutely love Hill Harper and adore Zoe Saldana.  It is a shame that this is the best that these amazing African American actors can get in terms of work.  Hill Harper's character is days away from marrying his beautiful fiance Charli (Zoe Saldana) when Charli runs into her former fiance and still aspiring actor Cool. Cool's reappearance in Charli's life makes her rethink her pending marriage. It's not that this is a completely horrible story, but the story line and production are average at best. These movie is slow in parts and contains out of place comedic scenes that border on buffoonery. Too bad for these amazing actors and some of the other good African American characters in this film.",1229472000,3,705,4.818181818181818
2726173,4,B000M7XRGA,Premium offers a fresh perspective on relationships flavored with a mix of family comedy. It's wonderful to watch and the characters are developed enough to carry out the theme and plot.  I look forward to more of Mr. Chatmon's films- I am sure as his career develops he will leave an indelible mark in the industry.,1211932800,2,316,4.642857142857143
2726174,3,B000M7XRGA,It started out slow.  Very god acting. IM glad they dint use  Eva from top model fame as the lead actress just because.  But good looking cast.  Realistic story. I didn't particularly like some of the dialogue or the scenes where he is going for auditions but the chemistry in the lvoe story is great and it rings true with a decent message.  IM debating whether to purchase however.  Will i really ever watch it again?  hmm.....  rent it.,1210377600,2,439,4.468354430379747
2726175,2,B000M7XRGA,"This movie should not have an average rating of 4 stars.  This show is definately not 5 star material. It's a 3 at best, but I'm giving it a two.  I didn't hate this at all, but I didn't like it very much either.  It was so long, and dry, and boring...I managed to push through and watch it all but it was difficult.

All of the actors were pretty good in this, except for Zoe Saldana.  This woman is a terrible actress to me.  Her acting is so bland.  I don't know what her problem is, it's like she takes a tranquilizer before she goes on set or something.

This was a boring movie, and the sordid ""relationship"" between Cool and Zoe Saldana's charachter was senseless.  It was like watching a movie within a movie, but this particular storyline didn't fit.

This movie really didn't look like a B-movie.  The lighting was good, the audio was great, and there was mostly veteran actors in it, too. I would say definately rent before you buy.  I was going to buy this until I saw it at Blockbuster so I rented it and ermmm......

I have no intention of buying.",1200960000,4,1061,4.271356783919598
2726176,4,B000M7XRGA,"This was a really good film. Loved the soundtrack and the way the director marked the scene changes. It was seemingly realistic, and I really appreciated the honesty the film portrayed. Although it was a little lenthy, with parts that could be taken out, I would love to see this as a play.",1199232000,2,290,4.490566037735849
2726177,5,B000M7XRGA,This has to be one of the most real and relatable movies I've seen in a long time.  Well written and well performed!,1189987200,,116,4.043478260869565
2726178,1,B000M7XRGA,"I love my black ""B"" rated movies but this one just didn't pull it off for me. It looked like cheap production. This wouldn't be a good pick if your into black movies like me.",1188345600,4,174,4.0
2726179,5,B000M7XRGA,"THIS WAS A VERY, VERY GOOD MOVIE!!  I REALLY ENJOY EVERYTHING THAT THE  TWO STARS ARE IN, ZOE SALDANA AND HILL HARPER BOTH ARE AWESOME.  I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE.

2726180,4,B000M7XRGA,"This movie kept me up all night, and I really only put it on as something to fall asleep to!  The acting was great, I loved the chemistry between the two main characters, and the storyline was real.  It's a definite keeper for me that I will be watching again, in the future.",1185580800,4,275,4.169811320754717
2726181,1,B000M7XRGA,I did not like the movie. I think the price was a little to high because the movie was poor. It didn't hold my interest.,1182816000,3,120,3.84
2726182,1,B000M7XRGA,"I think the actors in this movie have talent.  The material just didn't work for them.  The first thing that irked me was the cut to's.  If you know how to complete a movie, you shouldn't have to inform me of what's going on inbetween sceenes.  I hate that as much as I hate talking on a music CD.  I am paying to see a movie that explains itself.  This film does look like it has a decent budget, but the story doesn't work.",1182297600,3,425,4.0
2726183,2,B000M7XRGA,"I'm starting get a little disappointed in African American ""B"" movies these days. I have a lot of BET movies and they were really good. But lately, they are just stupid. Like this movie Premium. I'm so glad I rented it and not buying it. I'm just looking at it shaking my head. I mean, it wasn't horrible, but it's certainly a movie that should be rented.",1178409600,6,355,4.313432835820896
2726184,5,B000M7XRGA,"I've been tracking the buzz on this project for a few years now.  I'm glad it's finally out to the masses.  This is a charming smart film about the real relationships and the truth is it really isn't about the Black experience as much as it is the universal love experience that we've all been (or hope to go) through in life.

The cast is surprisingly on point for a small indie film with a nice ensemble of veteran actors such as Frankie Faison and Hil Harper also turning in great performances. Honestly, I'd see it again just for Zoey Saldana who not only beautiful to look at, but a true actress who turns in  a powerful subtle performance.

Not only does this film touch on some real universal relationship issues, it's also funny as hell which keeps things from ever getting too heavy. If you're sick of the same old hood crap, try this smart funny film.  (But don't just take my word for it, the very picky reviewers at ""Variety"" magazine also LOVE this film.)  5 Stars, baby!",1174867200,3,984,4.433333333333334
2726185,5,B000M7XRGA,I saw Premium in the theater in Atlanta and absolutely loved it. The performances were great and the story was smart and funny. It's a must-have for my personal collection. I can't wait to see it again!,1174780800,2,202,4.486486486486487
2726186,5,B000M7XRGA,"Pete Chatmon has created a gem of an indie film with Premium.  By turns romantic, sad, laugh-out-loud funny, and bitingly satirical, this picture manages to transcend the idea of genre and become a universally relatable musing on the complexities of love and life.  Chatmon's writing is spot on:  The dialogue is clever and quirky and the characters and New Jersey setting are rendered with a honesty and realism that effortlessly draw the viewer in.  The protagonist, Cool (Dorian Missick), is charming but not without his flaws and moments of frustration.  He's a good guy who's good but isn't perfect, a character who you want to root for from beginning to the film's bittersweet conclusion.  Great movie.",1174435200,3,708,5.060344827586207
2726187,5,B000M7XRGA,"Premium is one of the most believable movies about love I've ever seen. The extremely realistic performances from both Dorian Missick and Zoe Saldana present what's missing in romantic comedies today. With authentic characters and story-line, who needs Hugh Grant?",1173571200,6,264,5.625
2726188,5,B000M7XRGA,"PREMIUM is a refreshing approach to the relationship film. Not only does it handle relationships with honesty and humor, but it still makes you long for love, and remember the rocky road that it takes you on.",1173484800,3,208,4.648648648648648
8166961,2,B000M7XRGA,"I kept trying to catch this movie on BET and never was able to catch it. Thankfully Amazon prime had it Which finally gave me the opportunity to watch it. Now that Ive watched, Im disappointed that it didn't turn out the way you would expect it to be when previewed on commercials and so forth. This film needed lots of work & writing to be done. Thankfully it was just a low budget film because if I was to pay to see this on big screen, I would be pissed & request a refund.",1512777600,,476,4.021052631578947

8166965,4,B000M7XRGA,"If you are a Tyler Perry fan, move along, move along. Nothing to see here. And I'm not saying that to disparage you or Perry but rather as a description of how this movie compares to what TP puts out. I liked Premium because it's kind of a breath of fresh air in the field of African American romantic comedies. It stands on its own, being less a story about black people in a particular situation and more showing the relatable and funny interactions of a group of people who happen to be black. It is well-written, well-acted and well-paced. I saw it on Netflix and went to buy my own copy so that I could always catch it.",1402531200,,624,4.2521008403361344

8166969,4,B000M7XRGA,"Pete Chatmon is an intelligent filmmaker and PREMIUM is proof.  Not your average Hollywood roamtic triangle flick, PREMIUM is a thoughtful piece.
