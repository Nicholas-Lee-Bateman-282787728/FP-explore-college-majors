5375341,5,B00A2H9I5E,Loved the movie in the theater and am really happy to see it released on DVD!  Reflection on how we find our way as we work to stay vital as we become old goats!,1386460800,,161,3.735294117647059
5375362,4,B00A2H9I5E,"I expected to hate this film as I thought it would be another series of stereotypical views of oldsters.  I'm so tired of the ageism portrayed in most movies showing older adults as blubbering fools.

This film has great writing, the kind where some lines just make you smile due to their wisdom, or levity, or truth, or just well-crafted verbal thoughts.  The acting was better than many recent films I've seen.  There was something very authentic about the actors and when the credits rolled, I understood why.

Loved the sets.  And the characters.  This film was a wonderful surprise and quite entertaining.",1403568000,,610,4.864077669902913
5375363,5,B00A2H9I5E,"This movie was filmed in the Edmonds/Lynnwood, WA area. It is about three old guys and their different ways of handling life. My husband watched it three times now and is still chuckling.",1403308800,,187,4.696969696969697
5375364,3,B00A2H9I5E,"Largely unscripted, this is a clever film. The characters are quirky old men who enjoy meddling in each other's business. My main issue with it is that after all is said and done, little changes.  It is fun to watch.",1398902400,,216,4.4
5375365,5,B00A2H9I5E,A wonderfully quirky movie. Characters are real and story is engaging and entertaining. Outshines Hollywood big budget boring movies by a large margin.,1396137600,,151,5.608695652173913
5375366,4,B00A2H9I5E,"It was really funny, and more interesting since i personally knew one of the actors, as we were friends for over 40 years.",1395100800,,122,4.3478260869565215
5375367,5,B00A2H9I5E,"I really enjoyed this film. The story of Britt, Bob and Dave inter splices their real life friendship into a fictional fun and non depressing look at getting older. Taylor Guterson was able to harness these non actors and let them for the most part improv through a story that is quite funny and touching. I'm probably 40 years younger than these guys but it looks like it would be a blast to go have some beers with these guys sometime.",1394150400,4,437,4.407407407407407
5375368,5,B00A2H9I5E,"'Old Goats' is a sincere and enjoyable film about three men each trying (in different ways) to find meaning in their later years. Led by the honest and engaging performances of three amateur actors, it stands apart as a refreshing take on a 'bromance' comedy. Avoiding the monotonous 'old guy jokes' that plague so many geriatric films, Guterson provides an engaging snapshot into the lives of these three colorful and amusing characters. I would recommend this film to people not only of retirement age, but younger viewers as well!",1394150400,3,533,5.0

5375370,5,B00A2H9I5E,This little film is a real sleeper.  I saw it at the Seattle International Film Festival a couple of years ago and loved it.  I've been waiting for it to come out in DVD so I could give it as gifts to friends.,1392768000,4,209,3.8372093023255816
