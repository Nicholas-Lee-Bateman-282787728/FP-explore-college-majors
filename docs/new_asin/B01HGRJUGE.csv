7786516,4,B01HGRJUGE,"If you haven't figured it out ""Z"" is for zombie in all these misspelled titles. After the first viral zombie outbreak, ""Brimstone Protocol"" was issued, which were drone strikes...in Star Trek philosophy it is ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the zombie.""  Two billion people died, and Valerie Wilton (Claire Goose) is now making great profits by turning an island not cleared into a resort hunting ground. People pay outrageous sums to hunt and kill zombies. They have a careful Jurassic Park set-up. It is more like Deer Camp where ""sportsmen"" rest in a tree stand while shooting animals with high powered rifles in a baited field.

Melanie (Jessica De Gouw) has issues dealing with what happened. So in order to deal with killing 2 billion people (she also lost her father) it is recommended she go kill a few undead herself...like taking more poison to cure the effects of poisoning. We watch Sadie (Elen Rhys) download a virus into the Rezorts computer (My spell check is going crazy). We already know the outcome as the Brimstone Protocol was issued for the island. This whole story is a flashback. The only question is will our final girl escape, how, and will anyone else survive? There is also a slight twist.

I liked the film and the character Archer (Dougray Scott) which could have used a high dollar tough guy star. Melanie, our main character was by design to be slightly mousey. She projected a protagonist that was bland. I liked the original idea, decently executed. Valerie Wilton needed to be a more of a flamboyant showman. The island was supposed to located about where the Azores would be, but was filmed in the Philippines.

8765373,4,B01HGRJUGE,"Pretty good zombie movie! I liked the idea of a ""zombie vacation resort"" and that's just what it is! A little bit Westworld and little bit Jurassic park with ZOMBIES. The acting is good, some likable characters, the movie doesn't look cheap and there is plenty of action. I'm hoping there will be a sequel!",1517875200,,306,4.581818181818182
8765374,4,B01HGRJUGE,"Take Jurassic park and mix it with the games dead rising and Dead Island and that pretty mush sums this one up. So basically the world suffered a series of zombie outbreaks but managed to battle its way back and eradicate most of the undead, but an entrepreneur found an island full of zombies and turned it into a zombie-hunting safari resort much like Jurassic park. Despite some uninteresting characters I was surprised by this film. It makes great use of sound and does have some great tense moments, something that many of these films lack these days. The zombie make up is simple but done well and they are well acted and did make me feel I was in danger. Really the only thing I didn't like is that it started off slower than I would have liked but they manage to take an idea that was risky and a easy fail and pull it off into great movie but it did feel a little short.",1517270400,,879,4.269461077844311

 Was looking to buy it on DVD but I guess I can't so when it's available in the United States I'll buy it",1501459200,,194,4.162162162162162

8765377,4,B01HGRJUGE,"(The Resort) is one of the better Zombie films of late! It's fast paced, well shot and has an engaging story with some surprises. The casting was good ,I especially enjoyed (Dougray Scott) as a guest who's quite the sharp shooter and extremely good at killing Zombies.

There's some gore of course but they traded over the top gore for lot's of non stop action,which I really enjoyed. Most of the film is spent as the main characters are being stalked and terrorized by the Zombies whom escape their confines due to some shady business!

I believe lovers of horror and action films will really get into this flick.",1485388800,2,614,4.623853211009174

The ReZort is a safari park that offers paying guests the opportunity to kill as many zombies as they please following an outbreak.

This is certainly one of the most original and enjoyable zombie movies in the last few years, there are so many made these days and only few stand out and the ReZort is certainly one of them, great story that's the perfect set up for a zombie massacre, great overall cast and soundtrack, the movie is a huge blend of bits from resident evil, Jurassic park, west world, a hint of Romero movies in the score too, its really good fun, decent budget too for effects, certainly recommend checking this one out.

8765380,2,B01HGRJUGE,"Really hard to give this a four star rating since it had all the typical characters-we're-supposed-to-PERSONALLY-hate-so-much-that-we-viewers-turn-into-fantasy-murderers-who-relish-the-character-deaths -- which is quite a foul form of audience participation.  Then there were all the derelict buildings and grounds and basements for not a single reason at a first class resort.  Then there's all the no-reasons given for at least dozens of other elements of the film.  Okay, it's going down to three stars now that I've relived the film I just saw ten minutes ago.  Hero characters were as stupid as the other a-holes.  Way way way too many maddeningly stupid characters and almost no one written to be sane and smart enough to close a door when zombies are chasing.  Seriously, maybe two doors were closed.  Guns that scene after scene seemingly never ran out of ammo for a thousand shots and then ran out of ammo.  Not fair.  I liked a couple of the actors because of their other films, so I kept giving the film a break, but in the end I was worn down and just wanted the film to end.  Actually, okay, two stars it is.  Even the b-roll lacked continuity.",1484524800,,1157,4.94300518134715
8765381,3,B01HGRJUGE,"Oh come on. What could possibly go wrong with an idea like that? I was expecting an Asylum kind of movie full of cheesiness but its much better than that. Its a serious movie and done well. The acting is good and the direction isn't bad. The zombies look great and theres plenty of violence as the people who paid their way in get what they were hoping. Then, in Jurassic Park style, the system goes haywire and the zombies get some revenge. And you kind of root for them because most of the people are entitled douchebag types. So its fun to see them get ripped apart. Could have been gorier, maybe a bit more exciting. But not bad at all, way better than expected.",1476489600,2,666,4.2936507936507935
