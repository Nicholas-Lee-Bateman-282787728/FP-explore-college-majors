3123183,4,B0014567LQ,"FrightWorld (RedScream Films) has plenty of blood and gore to satisfy any splatter fan. There is more blood and gore in the first ten minutes of this movie than most movies have in their entire running time. There are a few boobs and thongs, but there could have been more skin. The film quality throughout was much better than the average no-budget film. The lighting was impressive in the intro and added a lot to the artistic look. There were plenty of cool shots. Some of the dialog audio was muffled and difficult to understand for a short time after the opening credits, but it got clearer as the film went on. Even though it probably had a smaller budget,  Fright World was as good as a lot of cable B-movies that I've seen.

The basic story is about a group of people who are mostly Goths previewing a haunted house inside a warehouse while a psycho killer who may have magical powers is brutally murdering them one by one. The acting is surprisingly good. The directing isn't bad. The dialog isn't very impressive, but hey, it's a splatter movie. If you want Shakespeare, you're on the wrong website!

My two biggest problems with the movie were the stylistic shift about twenty minutes into the film and the film's length. Imagine someone deciding to make a DVD of techno and goth music videos. About twenty minutes into the project, they realize that they don't have enough videos to fill a DVD, so they decided to fill the rest of the space with a splatter movie. Watching that DVD would probably be a lot like watching FrightWorld. Artistically, there are a lot of very cool visuals during the first twenty minutes, but then there is a major style shift that makes the movie feel fragmented. The stylish, gory, blood-soaked and artistic introduction sequence gives the back-story...sort of. This intro, the opening credits that follow, and even the lettering are presented like a music video in the style of Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Tool or Rob Zombie. The music, which was ok, sounded heavily influenced by the same bands. Then about twenty minutes into the movie, you have a whole set of new characters and the entire style changes from that of a music video to your standard dark B-movie. Neither style is bad, but the shift from one to the other makes you feel like you changed the channel. After the change, you have another ten minutes or so of build up before anything happens. Then the movie really picks up and settles into a solid story for a while; chainsaws, blood, gore, boobs, screaming, running, etc. Unfortunately, the final scene drags out for about ten minutes of dialog. Although the does tie things together with the beginning, it felt like too much talking. You've already seen just about everyone die and the climax is over. I think if the filmmakers had an outside editor, they probably could have cut a good size chunk out of the movie and it would have flowed a lot better.

Overall, FrightWorld was a pretty good movie. If you're looking for blood and gore, you'll find plenty of it here.

8254444,2,B0014567LQ,"A group of young adults visit the world-renowned Frightworld in preparation for the grand re-opening, but the ghost of a magical serial killer still roams the corridors of this haunted house waiting to pick them off one by one.

Well it started off with an appealing atmospheric style but sadly morphed into a rather generic, relatively bloodless slasher. (There are moments of gore but for the most part it's relegated to the beginning and ending) its a shame as if the film could've fully capitalized on the promise of the beginning we would've had a pretty memorable film on our hands.

8254445,1,B0014567LQ,"Frightworld begins showing a news reporter interviewing people about a murderer going around.  A guy won't respond to his wife being murdered.  We see a woman hanging in a basement while cops run around outside.  The killer grabs the hanging woman's stomach as the cops break in.  The killer sneaks up from behind and slashes the cops with an ax.  One cop has barbed wire lowered into his face and eyes.  Another cop gets an ax to the stomach.  The next cop sneaks around quietly and has a pole shoot up through the floor which pokes through his body.  The final cop says ""Shut up, drop your weapon and get to your knees!""  The killer walks up to the cop and sticks a sharp object in his stomach.  Another cop sees a ghost of a woman he knows say ""It's been so long, I love you real bad"".  He points a gun to her head and shoots.  The hanging woman says ""Get me out of here!""  The cop dies before he can untie her.  It's now the next day.  The killer crawls across the ground under a building.  He sees images of ghost children.  He's injured but barely makes it in the door.  What a long introduction!

The movie relies heavily on quick images immediately shifting into more quick images, and it's really awful.  We have horrible music to hear while this happens too.  This means it's hard to see what's going on and *especially* hard to follow the story.  The whole movie's like this, but for now some of these images include a man hiding in the corner of a building, a spider crawling on a dead guy's face, and Steven Tyler standing around with blood dripping from his mouth.

We see a black and white video of a man who opened up the Frightworld amusement park back in the 50's.  The factory of fear himself Dr. Solomon fled the revolution of bloody Sunday in Russia.  He says the horrific images he saw there influenced the horror we see in this amusement park.  But he loses money and staff, and eventually has to shut it down.  He puts away his amusement park equipment in an underground storage facility, goes home and hangs himself.

In present time we hear generic action music as these young men and women party to celebrate the grand opening of this amusement park.  These teens have no personality at all.  I mean *none*.  The generic action music is causing more harm than anything because this movie feels like a soap opera.  A man announces in 2 weeks we'll reopen the doors to Frightworld.  The picture switches to black and white as we see these men and women drink and smoke.  One of them lights a joint.  Even the way these characters converse is boring.  One man invites the group of young men and women inside Frightworld.  The man says the amusement park is complete with clowns and colors.  Never before has so much been put under one roof.

He continues.  The dead hate being dead.  Death is not the end of pain- it's the beginning.  The fences that surround the graveyard are there to keep in the dead.  Solomon brought in real grave soil for his amusement park.  Historians have observed the amusement park and throughout time evil forces have always been present here taking the lives of unsuspected passersby and adding their spirit to their very power.  The spirits still exist and roam in this amusement park.  They say the spirits can be seen sometimes.  Your phobia's are realized, and fears you thought you never had are exposed here in this amusement park.  Your mind begins to slip as you know you'll never get out.  After the instructor finishes he says this was his first draft and he has time to tweak it.  Well done, something constructive actually said!  They say ""Let's party!""  That's not constructive.

The women of the group smoke and pretend they're in a strip club taking their tops off.  At least one woman does.  The other women pretend they're guys sitting around enjoying it. A man and woman make out... somewhere in the darkness.  It's the most boring make out/sex scene ever too.  The woman says she's a virgin.  He says she doesn't look like one.  She says ""What does a virgin look like? What am I supposed to look like?  Would you prefer I wear a sun dress!"" The boring sex continues.  It's so boring I don't even know if this man and woman are the same ones from the previous make out scene.  When they fall asleep the spirit of the murderer appears.  Blood drips on the floor as bad heavy rock music plays.  Terrible screaming vocals.  We see hands swimming through silky blood.

After this the movie shoots back to the man and woman making out.  The drunk stripper girl staggers around as an actual song plays.  With a melody!  And piano and cool drumming!  And a cool lead singer who reminds me of the guy from the Monkees!  The lyrics are pretty extreme about killing and fornacating though.  The song even uses some weird effects with the carnival-like piano.  While the woman squats and pees she calls the clown on the wall a pervert and talks to him, comparing his big shoes to a small weiner.  She now sits there and gets off with her hands down her pants.  We go back to the man and woman having sex.  Suddenly he screams and covers in blood.  I guess his girlfriend bit his weinee off but it's hard to say for sure.

Another woman tells his boyfriend to keep a secret.  We can't make out the words but she's been traumatized by it and the boyfriend becomes sympathetic.  They stumble into an area covered in blood.  After her boyfriend says something silly she sarcastically says ""Do you think all this blood came from a nosebleed!""  They try to round up the rest of the group but the girls have a hangover and aren't exactly quick to leave.  The woman who was traumatized by something freaks out.  The men and women struggle to find a way out.  They get nervous and antsy.  They argue over who calls the shots pertaining to how to get out.  The woman sarcastically says ""I didn't mean to disrespect you master, yes master!""

The men find a dead body or blood (or both).  The men say they have to keep this private from the women.  The one man disagrees.  The men head back to the women and say they'll be out of here in a half hour.  A half hour from now the movie ends.  Can't wait!  The men find a puddle of blood, and then one of them gets poked in the back by a metal stick.  The one woman freaks out and threatens to kill someone in the group because she believes one of her friends is secretly the killer.  Nobody knows what she's talking about.  Makes me wonder why someone so freaked out over a traumatic event she experienced at this very place at an earlier time would return.  She tells everyone to stay away from her or she'll stick a pole in their brain.

The nerves remain tense as the group finds a way out.  They climb a ladder and try to break a metal gate.  They look through the metal gate and see it's black even though it's supposed to be morning.  Not darkness, but totally black.  Maybe, I dunno, there's something blocking the back of the wall?  That's how we usually see black in the day.  Just saying.  The guys finally reveal the dead body they saw, and when the one woman freaks out and pushes her boyfriend into a wall a claw comes out and rips him apart.  In another room a woman freaks out and punches a man.  She and her friend tie his knocked out body with rope.  The women think they've figured out who the killer is.  The one girl recommends barricading the door.  The other one disagrees and calls her a cow.  She says ""You don't go in the attic, you don't go in the basement and you darn sure don't go in creepy places!""  When persuaded to go into the creepy place given the life or death predicament they're in she freaks out and says if she dies she'll kick the girls butt sideways.  She'll also turn her butt sideways and turd cut her throat, lol.

The girls slowly calms down and think their friend will come back for both of them and get them out.  Suddenly the one girl gets her insides ripped out when she leans against the wall.  The blood splashes all over her friend's face.  Traumatized, she runs away when a monster appears.  Really terrible hard rock music plays.  It's excruciatingly bad and ruins the horrific moment.  She runs up to another woman who's a demon.  She turns around and somebody else grabs her face.  She screams and dies.  The demon girl apologizes.  I guess she's one of those on again/off again demons.  The horrible music plays again.  The camera is all over the place so we can't see what's going on.  It appears a monster is getting a metal pole shoved into him given the squirting blood though!  Wow, the camera moves so fast I can't see who's doing the killing *or* the person being killed!  This movie is so bad.

The woman who was freaking out over her traumatic ordeal from an earlier time stabs someone.  We see blood squirting on her face but the room's too dark to see who it is.  The killer appears and talks to this woman.  He says when you die your insignificant life becomes as insignificant as this movie...  I mean becomes universal awareness.  He says if she actually was able to grasp what he's saying her head would explode.  He says nothing matters in this world.  The world turns a blind eye when major catastrophes carry out.  He says God isn't here and nothing in the amusement park matters.  The woman says he's insane.

The killer says there are dark forces, and she can call them Elvis as far as he cares, lol.  He says he kills for the dark forces.  He's like Hitler or Jack the Ripper.  He says all these people have something in common- they kill for these dark forces.  The killer says he's actually dead and not used to the skin he's in.  He made sure if he died he had a back up plan.  He needs virgin blood.  The killer says he could hear this woman's voice and saw her face on the surface of some woman's eyes.  He says he didn't follow the rules so people who were supposed to live had to die.  He has to kill someone named Poptart.  He says he can relax when this virgin woman he's talking to can die.  She's the only one left.  He says he'll visit Canada for a change of scenery. ""I dunno, they seem bored!""

He goes over all the victims he killed.  In a fit of rage the killer says he can kill anyone he wants.  The woman reminds him that she was supposed to be his first victim but he saved her for last for his sick needs.  He then strangles the girl, but the appearance of a blinding light stops him.  The bad music is consuming him!  ""Stay away from me"" too!  He lights up in a ball of fire.  The girl  has visions of something evil.  She says ""I understand now"" and stands up with claws on her hands.  ""Stay away!"" plays again.

This movie has nothing but big problems.  The camera jerks around like crazy so you can't catch up to the events happening on screen.  The surroundings are dark almost the entire time.  Nothing related to the amusement park rides ever kills these characters or plays a part in any way.  Really bad hard rock music plays often.  The male characters are all completely bland but a couple of the female are decent at least (the one who had the traumatic event as well as the one who punches that guy out and ties him up).  I don't like anything about this movie.",1500768000,,11169,4.373229115779189

8254450,1,B0014567LQ,"This video is a cross between a bad, low budget soft core porn flip, and a bad, low budget, high school death metal garage band video. The only influences in this film was the alcohol and lines the producers did to put up money for this pile of garbage. And, I loved the fact that one of the stripper/victim's really appeared to be drunk throughout the move, and not just a little. Urinating on the floor and then sitting in it while talking to a wall mural of spooky clowns, classic. Another stripper/victim, claimed to be a Marine early in the film and then later a virgin right before she jumps on and cowgirl's her boss. At first the ultra low definition picture, coupled with the terrible lighting was annoying, but with a film this bad you just get numb to it. Can't be forgotten soon enough.",1484956800,2,798,4.4353741496598635

8254452,1,B0014567LQ,"You can safely ignore the longer review from the four star reviewer - HE IS THE DIRECTOR of this train wreck and obviously has a financial stake in getting you to watch this. If you are wavering, trying to decide if you will rent this, DON'T. It is shot terribly - horrible angles, terrible lighting, just...atrocious. The dialog and script, plot and pacing - all abysmal. The acting is beyond bad and well and truly into the realm of unwatchable. Even for C-horror (the relatively new genre of shot-on-video-no budget-""backyard"" productions that are so prevalent in this age of inexpensive video filmmaking), this one is a waste of time in every aspect. You can very safely ignore the four star rating one review chose to bestow on this. You can also safely ignore the somewhat catchy DVD artwork, which admittedly suckered me in. Just do yourself a giant favor and keep looking - there are many good C-horror movies out there (if you enjoy C-horror). This, as they say, ain't it.",1273190400,4,981,4.742690058479532
8254453,2,B0014567LQ,"If you've spent years yearning to see a woman masturbate to the images of spooky 3-D clowns while sitting in a pool of her own urine, then, brother, Frightworld is your perverted dream come true.  For the rest of us, Frightworld is - at best - 103 minutes of pure cinematic torture.  It's a pity because the film does have a unique hook - it was filmed in Buffalo at Eerie Production's Frightworld, ""a dark ride amusement featuring five different haunted houses, live costumed actors and state of the art special lighting and sound effects.""  Having access to one of the country's most popular haunted attractions obviously helped the filmmakers out budget-wise, but I don't think the scares of ""Frightworld the Amusement"" transfer over very well to film.  I found the abundance of visual effects (flashing sequences of images, strobing lights, etc.) more annoying than anything else, but at least now I better understand why the film was shot in this manner.  Speaking of annoyances, there's the loud heavy metal soundtrack that, on a number of occasions, drowned out some of the film's dialogue.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, as said dialogue is so bad that I couldn't help but wince at some of the characters' lines, especially early on when the cast apparently set out to break the Guinness world record for the most lame sexual innuendoes crammed into a single scene.  What about the gore, you ask?  There's definitely plenty of blood and gore to go around, I'll grant you that, but I didn't find it exceedingly realistic (especially when it came in the form of extended minutes of flashing images).

After a bloody introduction to Verden Fell (Gary Marzolf), a serial killer of 29 victims cut down in the prime of his murderous life, we join Jack (Andrew Roth) and a group of his exceedingly non-conformist friends in the warehouse holding all of the goodies from the famed Frightworld amusement park of yesteryear (which just so happens to be the location where Verden Fell died).  Jack is set to reopen the place in a couple of weeks, and we are among the first to endure his grand tour of the environs.  Of course, these crazy kids can't go too long without stopping to get drunk, smoke the biggest doobies on the planet, and - of course - pair off in couples to fornicate.  By this point, you're halfway through this overly long movie and - if you're like me - seriously considering pulling all of your hair out, downing a bottle of drain cleaner, and running stark naked out into the night in the grips of utter madness.

Finally, and not a moment too soon, the killing begins, and the movie actually becomes almost watchable.  I found a number of the murders somewhat confusing, though.  When I clearly see X kill Y, I can't help but be confused when the body, when discovered, ends up being that of X rather than Y.  On top of that, I know there's some sort of soul transference thing going on, but that's just one of many aspects of this film that doesn't work very well at all, in my opinion.

It's difficult to figure out which is worse: the script or the acting - but I'll go with the acting.  With characters saddled with such names as Albino, Acid Poptart, Sick Boy, and Susie Creamcheese, you don't expect Oscar caliber acting, but Gary Marzolf is the only actor in the entire cast who just might be able to act his way out of a dark room with a flashlight.  I have to believe that Creamcheese girl is either a heroin addict or else she is physically unable to open her mouth when speaking, as you can't understand a word she slurs.  The director only adds to the film's problems with some of the worst transitions from one scene to another I've ever seen.  I feel sort of bad for laying into this movie so viciously, as I appreciate writer/director David R. Williams' attempt to give the world another wonderfully gory horror movie, but the sad truth is that Frightworld just isn't very good in any way, shape, or form.",1214179200,5,3955,4.6134094151212555
