3467399,1,B001AV3BXG,"I'm sorry to say I rented this just because of the title, without doing any research! My bad...I didn't expect anything particularly intellectual, but just wanted to be entertained, maybe see some nice male bods and some beautiful scenery. (After 6 years of training, these guys looked like they better find a new workout guru. The one they had sucked!) The dialogue was absolutely ridiculous, especially based on the time period this was to have taken place...writers must have been under the influence of something! There was a total lack of acting ability and ho-hum action scenes, but I kept watching, thinking it MIGHT have some redeeming quality. NOPE. Save your money folks! This one's an absolute stinker!! I accidentally gave it a one-star rating, but it doesn't deserve even that! You can put this in the fantasy category, if you want, but the real fantasy is that someone actually thought this was a project worth putting money into.",1219881600,3,944,4.943396226415095
3467400,1,B001AV3BXG,"I remember seeing the first Scorpion King in the theater and I LOVED it. It had pretty much everything I could expect in a spin-off from The Mummy- Great action, lots of witty humor and very beautiful Egyptian location, and THE ROCK! What a fantastic and underrated . Now I saw the trailer for this one and thought ""Another one?"". Sadly, it looks like I was right. *Another* one. A movie I could laugh, cry, and gawk at how bad it is. So I decided to rent it anyways, because, well, hey, it's a Scorpion King movie. And oh, I couldn't even make it all the way through. It's that bad... well, actually it's WORSE!!!!! The location is AWFUL and nothing like the other movie which had BEAUTIFUL scenery in Egypt, the actors seem to have gotten their acting talents from 4 year olds, the battle scenes are awful too- shaky camera, constant jump edits, it's like you're having a seizure the whole time. Oh and the dialogue is mind-numbingly awful too. Overall, if you like mindless idiocy that's so-called ""Cinema"", be sure not to miss this stinker.",1219449600,4,1044,4.558510638297872

3467402,1,B001AV3BXG,I purchased this at Wal Mart on sale for $16 thinking it was in the vein of the previous series...boy was I wrong.  To think that the makers of the Mummy Series came out with this is unbelieveable. They must have been drunk when they made this.  It is the most sorry movie I have ever seen in 56 years of life.  If I could recycle this DVD I would but then I would be trashing the planet earth.  DO NOT waste your money..take your significant other out for dinner instead.,1219363200,3,472,4.153846153846154
3467403,1,B001AV3BXG,"The original Scorpion King wasn't anything spectacular to be sure, but it did the job in helping cement Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's transition from professional wrestler to action film star.  Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior is a direct to DVD prequel that is worse than you could possibly expect, this time with former Power Rangers cast member Michael Copon taking over as the young warrior Mathayus, who swears revenge against the evil Sargon (UFC star Randy Couture).  What follows are a string of boring and contrived action scenes that feel like veteran director Russell Mulcahy (Resident Evil: Extinction, the original Highlander) is phoning it in, and even his camera tricks can't hide just how small budgeted and sloppily assembled flick this is.  The acting, for lack of a better word, is about as good as it could be, with Couture coming off as a stiff villain.  Now it's no secret that viewers expected little out of Scorpion King 2, but who's to say that it could have at least been a little bit enjoyable or at least a guilty pleasure like it's predecessor?  Avoid.",1219363200,6,1081,4.790322580645161
3467404,1,B001AV3BXG,"Poor graphics, the characters didn't stand out.
The action never seemed to reach you and the acting and entire movie for that fact is what you would find in a really really low budgeted film.
Not worth seeing, even if you are a fan of the first installment or Mummy francise.",1219363200,3,275,4.411764705882353
3467405,1,B001AV3BXG,"No need to answer this question.  This movie should never have been made.  That's how bad it is.  The makers of the film were slick in giving us a glimpse of some of the better highlights of the movie.  The acting was poor, the dialogue was atrocious, the action was missing for most of the movie.  I shouldn't go on any further, because anything else I add to this will be worse.  Let me say that this movie is bad all around.",1219276800,5,427,4.146341463414634
3467406,1,B001AV3BXG,"This could be the worst movie I've seen in years. Total waste of a good blank dvd disk. No one in the movie can act. The special effects are a true joke consedering the technology available today. Talk about low budget. I'm embarrassed to say I actually threw away money to buy this truly horrible sequel to a decent but also not very good origional movie. SAVE YOUR MONEY. If you must,it will probably be on cable next week for free. I can't see it even going pay per view....",1219190400,8,477,4.311111111111111
3467407,2,B001AV3BXG,"I had looked forward to seeing a Scorpion King 2 movie. Needless to say I picked this up not expecting much and luckily my expectations weren't shattered.

First the movie lacks, well it lacks the Rock. Second, it lacks the pure fun factor of the original Scorpion King movie. With that said, the acting wasn't oscar worthy but I didn't pick it up expecting it to be. It is worth watching, it is NOT worth spending 30 on it to pick it up in blu-ray. DVD, maybe. This movie is for those whom liked the old B adventure movies/tv shows. Kevin Sorbo, Hercules, Xena..though those shows are better then this you get the idea.

This movie is for those who aren't overly critcal and just like to watch adventure movies. If you are one of those people that analyze and rip every detail to shreds, this movie isn't for you.

The movie stars ex Power Ranger Michael Coupon. While he brings decent fight skills to the movie, his acting is subpar. Not horrid just not great.

The plot is your basic I need to get revenge for the death of my father. His father was suppose to be this elite warrior who frankly looked more like the janitor at my local health club. He wasn't believable as this invincible warrior that Matheyus looked up to.

The wizard/king was a complete waste of time, not believable and reminded me more of an ex wrestler and maybe he is, I didn't find it worth the effort to look up. He was no replacement for Memnon in the first Scorpian king who oozed evil fairly well.

I would go into more detail, but to be honest, after a few weeks, I've already started to forget half of the movie where as I still remember the original Scorpian King years and years later.

I for one like B movies as I'm not overly critical. But this movie is not worth the blu-ray purchase. DVD maybe but I'd wait for cable.",1219190400,14,1807,4.3601190476190474
3467408,1,B001AV3BXG,"First, the Rock is not in the movie, but that's no great loss.  The ""star"" , the bald dimwit, must be one of the absolute worst actors ever to disgrace the screen.  Laughably bad.  The SFX? Low budget, low tech, low quality.  Most situations - idiotic.  Nothing action packed, sexy, or remotely interesting in this waste of time.  If you removed the title of ""....Scorpion King"", you would not even look twice at this in a closeout bin.

Come on - the ""Black Scorpions"" - the elite of the elite, have the build and muscle mass of a 14 year old girl - after they have undergone 6 years of training.  Totally predictable plot, lousy sword fights (no skill - just really bad moves!), b-grade all the way.",1219190400,8,701,4.421875

3467438,4,B001AV3BXG,"After suffering through the abominations that were Scorpion King 3&4, I decided to revisit the last entry in the franchise that adults can enjoy. Scorpion King 3&4 failed because they sacrificed thrilling action scenes for poorly-done slapstick humor, especially crotch shots, and they featured people burping and farting on each other. What's even worse is that the filmmakers seemed to forget that the Scorpion King is supposed to eventually become a villain, so there were dark elements that were missing. Whereas those films were comedies masquerading as action films, Scorpion King 2 is a legit action/adventure film with only occasional comic relief, which is the way it should be considering it's tied to the Mummy franchise. The action scenes are very well done, with the first couple scenes rivaling the first movie. The stakes really feel high in this one, and for the most part the tone is dark and serious, and from the surprisingly cool deleted scenes, it's clear that it was originally intended to be even darker. The CGI was alright for a straight-to-video movie, but there were some CGI scenes that took me out of the movie. Randy Couture as the villain Sargon looks pretty badass and menacing, and is an excellent opponent for Michael Copon as our hero Mathayus, who does a great job in the lead role. When I first saw this film, I was disappointed that Dwayne Johnson wasn't in it, but it's important to remember that this is a prequel with a much younger Mathayus, so it wouldn't have worked to bring him back anyway. Karen David is sexy and plays the strong female lead who can really kick ass. As for the comic relief sidekick, which every PG-13 action/adventure film apparently needs, his jokes are hit-and-miss, but he isn't obnoxious and is actually very helpful, unlike the horrible sidekicks in 3&4. Judging from the way the franchise has gone, I highly doubt it will ever get this good again. Scorpion King 2 is as far as the series needed to go, and it's a fun ride, so check it out!",1432512000,,2011,4.781609195402299

She makes the movie worth watching. I've watched this film three times now (today being the third), and I'll still have to say, the story is not so great, but I love seeing Karen David in that sexy outfit.

I could detect almost nothing having to do with Egypt in the film; the lead character could just as easily have been in Conan's Hyborian world.

The entire film is very similar in theme to the first season of Spartacus, except that Spartacus was extremely well written and executed.

3467531,4,B001AV3BXG,"Like the running gag so often repeated throughout this movie: ""Never trust a Greek,"" my review title offers a pretty good rule of thumb, but is it always true?  Is it true in the case of this movie?  To my very considerable surprise the answer was no.

Because I had simply assumed it was awful, I'd avoided it for years, despite knowing from my own experience that similar assumptions about the prequel it is a prequel to had turned out to be false.  So does that mean The Scorpion King 2 is another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Scorpion-King/dp/B00005JKYX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Scorpion King</a>?  Not quite.

The lower budget definitely shows as does the cast of even more unknowns, even less barely knowns, and even less well known character actors.  Randy Couture's performance is so wooden you'll expect him to sprout leaves.  Finally, the writing is even more constrained by subsequent events as not only the young couple but the entire Akkadian civilization is known beforehand to be ultimately doomed.  (Like The Scorpion King this movie works best if you forget about everyone's eventual dark fate.)

Nevertheless, cast and crew put in a mighty effort, and it shows.  Simon Quarterman steals every scene he's in as the untrustworthy Greek in question, and Tom Wu does an amazing job in what is essentially a nonspeaking part as a hopelessly lost Chinese acrobat.  Natalie Becker gives a nicely disturbing performance as a borderline psychotic goddess, through deliberate mannerisms Michael Copon manages a better Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson imitation than I would have thought possible, and Karen David gives us a spunky, more believable than it ought to be, performance as the girl next door who insists on being one of the boys.  In particular there was good effort all around to make the necessarily low budget fight scenes look good.

Could it have been better?  Absolutely, but IMHO no one involved has anything to be ashamed of about a good solid (if not as professionally polished as I would have preferred) effort.",1349395200,3,2089,5.212574850299402

When it came time to open presents, I exchanged gifts with one of my dear friends. He gave me an iPod full of my favorite Kenny Chesney songs. I love Kenny Chesney. I knew then that what I got him would be worthless in comparison, but he assured me it's the thought that counts. So I handed it over to him, at which point he paused thoughtfully. ""Before I open this,"" he said, ""I just have something real quick to say. Just something real quick."" He proceeded to ask me if I'd ever seen The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior. Before I could answer, a somber expression came over his face. He informed me of how much he hated the movie, specifically on Bluray. He absolutely hated it. Then he gave me a smile and began unraveling my gift to him. Once he popped open the box, he was visibly overcome with joy at the sight of his favorite dripping wet jumbo shrimp that lie within. He decided to save them for later, probably because he was so stuffed with fruit cake. To his surprise, he discovered that there was indeed another gift beneath the shrimp. But gradually the surprise turned into dread, as he realized that the second gift just so happened to be The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior. Specifically on Bluray. I was humiliated and horrified. He looked at me with such shame. ""This is just awful,"" he said. ""This is terrible. I don't even want the shrimp anymore. The shrimp is tainted. It's just tainted.""

And then he flung the remainder of his egg nog upon my person. To my dismay, everybody else in the room followed suit. By the end of it all I was soaked in egg nog. It permeated my flesh. No one loved me. I was alone, and all because of this movie.

I don't mind sword and sorcery hokum, even the low budget variety, but I ended up feeling sorry for the actors in this one.
We have all the standard makings of a franchise follow up.

Hero - check
Babe - check
Geek - check
Bad guy - check

Add the stock additional characters to add supposed depth, but there chiefly to die in some grisly fashion, some tricky situations, monsters, and a good dose of ""dark magic"" and you've about got it all.

3467558,3,B001AV3BXG,"THE SCORPION KING 2
RISE OF A WARRIOR

When watching this film I couldn't help but think three things, one is that how awesome is it that Randy Couture has a starring role in this, two this would have made a better episode of Hercules The Legendary Journeys, and three this is in no way as good as the first. Ok maybe that last one is a bit false since this one has great production value going for it like the first but that is about it. When I first found out about this film all I could think was that I needed to buy it because of Randy and that I owned the first one. After watching all I could think was that was all right I guess, if it would have been a stand alone it may have faired better. In fact what is up with a prequel to a prequel, oh well I guess it was worth exploring. Still this isn't as bad as I am making it sound if you go into it knowing what type of film you are in for.

Our story this time sees a young Mathayus [Michael Copon] wanting to join the ranks of the Black Scorpions which is the king's army. But all does not go according to plan as his friend Layla [Karen David] joins in on the try outs which is only for boys, of course the head of the guard Sargon [Randy Couture] is not about to let that happen. As she is about to be punished Mathayus steps in and therefore must be punished as well. This does not set well with Ashur [Peter Butler] Mathayus's father so he steps in to save his boy and get into it with Sargon, the king has to break it up before it gets ugly. It is this moment that sends Sargon into a rage that ends with Ashur dead and a young Mathayus wanting revenge.

So off he goes to join and train as a Black Scorpion so that one day he will have the skills necessary to defeat the murderer of his father. Once back things don't go as planned and he as well as Layla are off on a quest to find some magical sword in the underworld that can defeat Sargon's black magic. It is here were they run into a young poet/writer named Aristophanes or Ari as the obvious short. It is also here that the film contradicts the first one but more on that later. Here our group of young heroes travel across sea, deserts, a labyrinth, and even the dreaded underworld [which actually looks really cool]. They also do battle with minotaur, other people, and the queen of the underworld, sounds like quite the adventure. All of that is fine and well and is entertaining but it comes off as a TV show like Hercules more so than a feature film.

This is far from a perfect film as there are plot holes every were and this film actually contradicts the first. I won't go into a list or any thing but the most obvious is the Egypt thing. I am pretty sure that at the beginning of the first one the voice over says something like ""in a time before the pyramids"" right? Well when they are getting their tickets for the boat they say they are taking a trip to Egypt to see the pyramids, now if the first was before the pyramids and this is before the first, well. I won't go into any more of those but that is a big enough one right there at least for me, I hate when they do that. I guess the fault would be with writer Randall McCormick, he should have at least watched the first one and noticed that. His writing isn't all bad though because unlike most people I really don't mind the mixing in of all the other myths like the Minotaur and such. Sure it doesn't make full sense with this film, but hey at least it is entertaining.

Director Russell Mulcahy did ok with this film but his direction seemed uneven at times, but watching the behind the scenes and listening to the commentary it is obvious that he wanted to make a good film. I guess my biggest complaint is that I really did not see the character of Mathayus coming up like this, I don't know but it seems like he would have came up a little harder and in a more realistic struggle. And while Michael Copon did a good job with what he was given to play Mathayus I just didn't see that same character in him. But that may been due to the writing of the character, but at the same time the performance should have been there. Karen David was good as Layla and as the romantic interest of Mathayus and Tom Wu was excellent as Fong. Still the stand out characters were Ari played by Simon Quarterman and like I said in the last one I am a sucker for comic relief. And of course Sargon played by Randy Couture who does a good job for what is first major role, you can see flaws at times but for the most part he is good as the evil lead.

This is a decent movie over all and is worth a rental to see if you are into it first, but if you didn't like the first you will most likely hate this one. One thing I must say though is that the production value was good on this, the underworld looked awesomely creepy with those faces and stuff sticking out moaning in pain and loneliness.",1242691200,,4868,4.092146596858639

3467565,2,B001AV3BXG,"Scorpion King 2:  Rise of a Warrior is a prequel to the original film, telling the story of  Mathayus (the role played by Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson in the first film) as a young man.  He is trained to become one of the feared Black Scorpion mercenaries.  Returning home, Mathayus finds that Sargon, the man who killed his father, is the new Akkadian King, alleged to have murdered the previous King Hammurabi.  Mathayus vows revenge against Sargon (played by UFC champion Randy Couture) and attempts to kill him.  Sargon, however, has sorcery to aid him and Mathayus finds himself on the run with his childhood friend and love, Layla (Karen David).

Onboard a ship they meet Aristophanes, a Greek scribe, who tells them about the legendary Sword of Damocles that can cut through anything.  The trio sets off on a quest to find the sword located in the Greek Underworld.  Along the way they will pickup a group of former prisoners as allies, battle a Minotaur, and take on the Goddess Astarte to try and claim the weapon.  The story climaxes in a battle between Mathayus and Sargon, who has transformed himself into a giant scorpion.

Historically accurate Scorpion King 2 is not.  The first film is said to take place before the time of the pyramids and yet when Mathayus meets Aristophanes, the Greek tells them he's on his way to Egypt to ""see the pyramids"".  Sargon and Hammurabi are both well-known figures from ancient history.  Sargon indeed was King of Akkad and his rule fits into the general time period of the film, roughly 2250 BC.  Hammurabi, however, was not around until some 500 years later.  This period is also about a thousand years before the rise of ancient Greece so Aristophanes' presence is completely out of place.

The Scorpion King 2 is one of those films that are so brazen in its ""badness"" that it is actually good.  There's no attempt to make the dialogue sound authentic and modern slang is used throughout the movie.  Like the first film, it doesn't take itself serious at all, although I'm not sure all of the humor was intentional.

Couture accounts himself quite well.  He's not asked to do much other than to growl and play the bullying king but he's not as wooden as you might think.  Mathayus is played by Michael Copon, best known for playing the Blue Power Ranger in Power Rangers: Time Force.  He's not a physically imposing as The Rock but he's got a solid physique and admirably carries the role of the younger character.  Karen David is a lovely actress of Indian descent and while she doesn't look Middle-Eastern, she has an exotic look that fits the part..

What was particularly impressive for a direct-to-video film was the quality of the set design.  The ancient city of Akkad looks good, even if it does seem like they run down the same street every time.  Scorpion King 2 is not a great movie...it's not even good, really, but it is cheesy, campy fun filled with action and ridiculous yet amusing dialogue and characters.

I call it ok cause I paid like[...] for it I would definately not pay the 20 they're askin for it right now buy it used or rent it but it's definately not worth more than [...] and no where near the stories of the Mummy movies or the first Scorpion king.,1228089600,,892,4.0397727272727275

That being said, it was better than Indiana Jones Crystal Skulls, and even better than the most recent installment of Narnia: Prince Caspian. So I can't be too harsh, given it had a fraction of the budget of those other films.

It had some decent special effects (the underworld, the battle scenes), but other effects (the scorpion, the minotaur) were simply awful. And yes, the acting was pretty bad.

Enough said about this movie. If you like B-movies, if you're really into the Scorpion King/Mummy franchise, if you're into cheesy, then you'll like it. If not, it might be best to avoid. (2.5 stars)",1221436800,,712,4.725806451612903

I thought it was just alright, but something confused the crap out of me! Mathayus's brother died in the first one, but this one takes place before the original, and his brother dies in this one. Unless he had two brothers, that did not make sense. Other than that, the storyline was okay. Mathayus wants to avenge his father's death, so he trains for six years. When he comes back, the man who killed hid dad became king. Later, Mathayus and his girlfriend Layla end up in the Underworld. There are some funny moments, but it's still not as good as the original Scorpion King! I probably wouldn't recommend THE SCORPION KING 2: RISE OF A WARRIOR!!!",1220832000,,780,4.423611111111111
3467612,1,B001AV3BXG,"After only amassing a moderate box office success with 2003's ""The Scorpion King"" starring former wrestling superstar Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Universal Pictures apparently put on hold any potential sequels to the prequel (that sounded funny... oh well) of their popular ""The Mummy"" series. In 2008, Universal dusted off the character of the Scorpion King for another shot at movie audiences; however, this effort would not star The Rock, as it was to be a prequel (a decision that I believe was prompted by The Rock most likely rejecting the notion of starring in another `Scorpion King' movie), and it would also skip any kind of theatrical release, going directly to DVD. So, let me think about this for a second, the star of the original movie most likely rejected the idea of reprising his role for a sequel, potentially causing the shift from sequel to prequel, then the movie skips theaters altogether and goes directly to DVD, finally getting released around the same time as another `Mummy' movie was hitting theaters. Does anyone else besides me believe that this spelled potential disaster for this second entry in the inferior spin-off series to ""The Mummy""? Let's have a show of hands... Yeah, that's what I thought, pretty much everyone sees this movie as nothing more than a hack job primarily made for cashing in on the recently released ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"".

""The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior"" centers on a young Mathayus (Michael Copon) as he begins learning the ways of an assassin in order to better serve his king. However, when a warrior named Sargon (Randy Couture) murders Mathayus' father, Mathayus forgoes his oath of honor to begin a quest for vengeance against the evil Sargon and all those that side with him.

Wow, I don't know if I can think of a time when the description on the back of a DVD could have been further from the truth. The description touted this action/adventure prequel as ""...a heroic adventure filled with heart-stopping action and thrilling visual effects!"" Well, I'm not sure what movie the marketing people that came up with that load of bull were watching, but it sure wasn't ""The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior"", I can tell you that right now. For a movie with supposedly ""heart-stopping action"", I was fairly bored a good majority of the time, and as for the ""thrilling visual effects"" they were more like B-movie effects or worse. In fact, I think that the Sci-Fi channel original movies have better effects than what was employed here.

It's also a pity to note that director Russell Mulcahy comes fresh off of helming the successful third entry, ""Resident Evil: Extinction"", in the popular zombie franchise to directing this Direct-to-DVD piece of garbage. Now, I'm not trying to insinuate that I feel like Russell is an A-list director at all; in fact, I don't think he will ever compare to the likes of Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorcese, but regardless of that, he still is a decent enough Hollywood director that has had his fair share of successes that he deserved better than to be directing this movie. If Russell chose this as his next movie of his own free will then that's one thing, I personally would be shocked if that were the case, and would have to seriously question the judgment of a person who would willingly subject themselves to the kind of criticism this movie will draw from critics and movie fans alike. It is possible that whoever convinced Russell Mulcahy to direct this movie made the concept sound a heck of a lot better than the end result ever could hope to be, and if so, then kudos to whoever did the selling, because whatever you said worked and you managed to get a decent Hollywood director to really demean himself by working on a project as pathetic as this one.

The cast for this movie was comprised of relative newcomers to the industry, several of them did have previous movie experience, but not much and what little they had wasn't all that impressive to be worth mentioning. For instance, the actual star of the movie (even though he doesn't get top-billing), Michael Copon, his biggest claim to movie fame was the third installment in the `Bring It On' franchise (a franchise that apparently will not go away) with ""Bring It On: In It to Win It"". I must point out that Michael was a good choice for the role because he does appear to be a decent enough resemblance to The Rock to pass off as a believable younger version of the first film's star. Getting top-billing for this movie, even though he only appears in maybe half of the movie, is UFC star Randy Couture. Days before watching this movie, I had seen Randy in David Mamet's ""Redbelt"" where he played a commentator for a fighting organization similar to UFC, and in that movie I thought that Randy showed some real potential to be a good actor; however, whatever potential I thought he had, was completely squandered by the time I saw his performance in this movie. Randy apparently didn't know how to effectively play the villainous role whatsoever, because there's nary a scene in which he isn't snarling or saying his lines in a menacing way, even if the line doesn't warrant that type of reading. With such a laughable performance as the one in this movie, I now feel that Randy has little to no hope for a future in Hollywood films, at least from my humble perspective.

""The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior"" has got to be one of the most blatant, and poorly executed, attempts at cashing in on a theatrical release that I have seen go directly to DVD in a long time. The writing is horrible, the acting is sub-par at best, and the visual effects are possibly worse than an episode of The Power Rangers on TV. There is nothing much to praise with this prequel other than these two points; 1) Michael Copon was a good casting choice and did an alright job with the role, and 2) the movie does eventually end after an overly bloated, almost two hour long running time; so that those who were like me, and suffered through every moment of this crap, can eventually begin to work on putting the experience out of their minds. Perhaps some therapy could help, who knows.

""The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior"" is rated PG-13 for violence and sensuality.",1220486400,32,6255,4.666364460562104

8279784,5,B001AV3BXG,"Mathayus is a warrior from the Akkadian Empire trained into the Order of the Black Scorpion. There are a few glaring historical mistakes during the series, such as the Akkadian Empire ended around 2300 BC yet the lands between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers is described as 'desert' but back then it was rich grasslands, a bread basket, the Cradle of Civilization; it wasn't until the end of the Bronze Age which was about 1200 BC that the area of modern day Iraq began to turn to desert. Also, throughout the series we see Roman Armor and Medieval castles. We also see sword designs which would never survive in battle and armor which is totally fantastic. But all that aside, the series is not half bad although it must be considered a B-Movie series including skimpy outfits and sometimes cheesy lines. They fight scenes are pretty good. There is no frontal nudity although there are some suggestive dialog and situations.

The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior is the origin-story of Mathayus, the protaganist of the series. His co-star is a tom boyish kick butt girl and there is also another hard fighting character that is a goddess of love and war featured in the story. Mathayus' father is murdered by Black Magic and Mathayus sets out to revenge his father's death, traveling to the Underworld to retrieve a magic sword to kill his nemesis.

The Scorpion King stars The Rock and is the only film he appears in. An evil king is trying to take over the world, and doing quite nicely as he is using a sorceress who can foresee the future to tell him when to attack. A unit of Scorpion Warriors are hired as mercs to stop the evil King.

The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption stars Victor Webster as Mathayus after he loses his Wife and Kingdom. In this movie Mathayus goes to India and fights a guy who summons three dead heroes to aide him in conquering all of India. Mathayus teams up with a The Cobra who is fighting a guerrilla war against the bad guy. Again there are two tough female fighters in this movie with great fight scenes between them.

The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power again stars Victor Webster as Mathayus. In this movie our hero teams up with a displaced Princess and her crazy tinkerer father to over throw a power mad King and reinstate the rightful line onto the throne of a European mountain kingdom. This one has the most laughs in it.",1525478400,,2377,4.546728971962617

The first Scorpion King had the classic Mummy formula: swords and sorcery, vague Egyptian mythology and history, adventure, and sexy chicks in pointlessly revealing outfits who can fight but generally need an similarly clad big strong man to save them. The only difference is that in here, the special effects, the sets, and the prop work are so badly, badly, badly done that I literally wondered if there was something wrong with my TV. The acting is horrendous - Mathayus is acting like he's in some teen action movie and Randy Couture is so wooden I could carve a doll out of his forehead that would act better. Karen David is an actress of note, but not in this movie. She's just Mathayus' cute gal pal and that's it. Do you remember that Mathayus has a father? You can forget, since besides the vengeance plot he's pretty much pointless and forgettable.
