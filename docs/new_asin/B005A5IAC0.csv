4639550,1,B005A5IAC0,"This is going to be the last season of Torchwood because there is no way it will ever be picked up for another season. The writers have NO idea how things work in the USA or they are just too lazy to portray things correctly. Both the American and UK actors are just not that good, especially the main characters. The story is mostly padding and filler as they try to stretch a thin storyline over 10 episodes. Also, Doctor Who and Torchwood canon is ignored in several instances, either because the writers have no grasp of the canon or just do not care. Save your money, this series has no rewatch value, it barely is watchable the first time through.",1310428800,10,653,4.404958677685951
4639551,5,B005A5IAC0,"Imagine that no one dies. Plants and animals continue with their normal life-cycles, but humans don't. They sustain massive injuries, get blown up, stabbed, burned, what have you, but yet they live and live and live without the great surcease of pain. For some this would be a blessing; time granted to them while surgeons repair damaged bodies. To others it would be a living hell no one should ever endure.

This is the situation the world finds itself in at the start of ""The New World,"" the first episode of Torchwood: Miracle Day. It's the fourth series to of the Doctor Who spinoff be produced and the first to be co-produced with the American television network Starz.

As the story opens, we find a man, Oswald Dane (Bill Pullman), about to be executed for the rape and murder of a twelve-year-old girl. His defense? ""She should have run faster."" Not the most sympathetic character. We watch as his execution begins and then starts to go horribly wrong when, in a scene that went on almost long enough to become funny, he starts screaming in agony and breaking loose from his restraints.

He's not the only person to survive apparent death. CIA agent Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), is driving while being told that the word ""TORCHWOOD"" is appearing on screens all over the CIA, only to disappear as quickly. As he's processing this, and indulging in some job hunting, some rebar falls from a truck in front of him and does, oh, some very nasty things. He's brought to the hospital where, to everyone's surprise including his own, he lives.

Soon word of undying people spreads around the globe and everyone begins looking for answers. Matheson's friend, fellow CIA agent Esther Drummond (Alexis Havins), thinks there may be a connection with Torchwood. She raids the CIA archive, finds a photo of Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), and then is confronted by the man himself, who saves her from an explosion and then is troubled to notice that a scratch on his arm isn't healing.

Matheson himself soon leaves the hospital and begins investigating the case, eventually traveling to Wales where he complains a lot and tracks down Gwen Cooper, who has been leaving peacefully with her husband Rhys and baby Anwen. Rhys is less than pleased to have anyone snooping around trying to get his wife involved. Cooper on the other hand seems to have become bored with domestic life and is quite keen to return to the fight; a fight that becomes all too literal as assassins try to kill everyone.

The show is off to a great start. All the characters we know and love from the British series (well, those still alive at any rate), return and are put to good use, though the show is nearly stolen away from them by exceptional performances from Mekhi Phifer and Bill Pullman. The central problem of a never-dying population is also handled with intelligence and logic, including a couple conversations about why, exactly, this is a problem.

The program is also doing an excellent job of building off the darker, more adult feel the series gained with 2009's Children of Earth, but isn't nearly as buried in dread. Fans of that series will also be pleased to know that it hasn't been forgotten and that numerous references to the 456 turn up throughout the first episode.

While it is hard to evaluate the entire series on the strength of this first episode, I will say that it seems to be off to a great start. At no point was I bored or disinterested in what was happening, and I am very much looking forward to what happens next. Producer Russell T Davies has created an exceptionally fascinating conumdrum and watching how he gets everyone out of it promises to be vastly entertaining.

GRADE: 4 stars out of 4.

Returning to the series are stars John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness, Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, supporting actors Kai Owen and Tom Price, as well as Russell T Davies and some of the rest of the production staff. Joining the cast are Mekhi Phifer, Bill Pullman and Alexis Havins. The program begins airing in the USA on Starz on July 8, and in the UK on BBC One on 14 July.",1310083200,18,4093,4.664355062413315

4639584,4,B005A5IAC0,"Big change from the first three seasons, but well worth watching.  Fans of the first three seasons may find Miracle Day difficult to start - Jack and Gwen have changed and the first four episodes emphasize those changes in somewhat painful ways.  However, if you persevere through the fifth episode our old friends re-emerge, new bonds/friendships are forged, and it is fast action through to a fascinating ending.  It is too bad this series has been permanently shelved.",1492300800,,471,5.012820512820513
4639585,4,B005A5IAC0,"Despite the malicious absurdity of Season Three, Season Four ascended back into the quality realm of Seasons 1 and 2, albeit shifting from fighting against extraterrestrials over to coping with the day to day criminal schemes of corrupt and abusive goofermints and their puppeteers.  Interesting action adventure series again in Season Four with mostly plausible technobabble.  Particularly cute was the switcheroo at the very end of Episode 10 where a transfusion of immortal blood created another immortal while real experience has had numerous hetero humans murdered with transfusions of HIV infested blood supplies gathered by the American Red Cross from homosexual donations and sold to medifraud ""hospitals"" to expand the incidence of the felony religionist insistence on ""heterosexual AIDS"" as part of their felony abrogations of the human and civil rights of heteros to practice our own hetero religion.",1490918400,,911,5.546762589928058

(Christ said I've a new commandment for you, Love one another, paraphrase of course I don't have a photograph memory, but close enough,it's nice the pope loves gay folks,and is more inclusive) I've always thought God tests folk, to see who loves ,who hates, nde are not proof positive, but still that's what serious studies suggest! For an atheist to put that in, shows a more open mind,I like that! The acting is really great, especially the bad guy who is really superb,just to watch a pro at work, and Jack holds his own when he steals the scenes he's in!",1487462400,,642,4.4033613445378155

Something about John Barrowman was bugging me, some thing familiar but I couldn't place it. It wasn't until  Miracle Day that I finally figured it out.  Barrowman looks like a young Mark Harmon (Gibbs/NCIS).",1486080000,,323,4.925925925925926
4639623,4,B005A5IAC0,"Going into season 4 I didn't really know what to expect but even though it was one main event carried through 10 episodes, it was good! Some of the new characters' stories aren't fully told. Jack and Gwen aren't the same as before because they lost so much and things have drastically changed. In the first few episodes, you can kinda tell Jack isn't his usual self. Near the end there I thought it was gonna be one elaborate love story, and I did wish they delved a bit more into the 'morphic fields' and the alien tech.
All in all, it was a good show and I'd recommend it. It's kinda more about real life than aliens. If you want aliens, go watch Doctor Who.",1485993600,,660,4.246031746031746

4639644,1,B005A5IAC0,"The first two seasons of this show were decent.  The third got a bit dull, and the fourth one just lost me.  Halfway through, I stopped watching because I didn't care about what happened to any of the characters.  Their motivations were barely there, all the charm was sucked out of the series when they tried to make these big, grand conspiracies, and frankly everything that drew me to Torchwood in the first place is gone in the fourth season.  It could be any espionage-heavy show with convoluted end-of-the-world scenarios and frankly if this is where they planned to take the show from the start, they never should have been given a  third season.",1483920000,,653,4.692982456140351

4639646,4,B005A5IAC0,"The 5th season is very much about a single event that changed the world. On one day suddenly death no longer existed on the earth. People with injuries that normally would bring about death live.  That doesn't mean that the injuries didn't happen, and for the most part the injuries don't heal. Somehow Jack is the key to this whole event, and somewhere buried in his long past is the solution.  The Torchwood team is joined by two CIA operatives who are very well played and much of the series takes place in the United States.  The acting was excellent and the story was very complex with lots of twists and turns to the very end.  In fact the movie ended with a little surprise.  My only gripe and I guess that makes me a prude, but I realize that Jack's character is homosexual but did we have such a long scene with him and another guy. I would have still objected if there was such a long scene involving a man and a woman. Still I very much recommend this series.",1483315200,,970,4.3076923076923075

4639680,4,B005A5IAC0,"I started watching the series after it was already gone, because I was introduced to the character Captain Jack Harkness in the ""Dr. Who"" series.  Although the show suffered greatly from the loss of key characters (I won't name to avoid being more of a spoiler), I was please to see the major transition in the final season and hoped that more episodes would come.  The situations were largely unbelievable and as many syfy shows do, it painted itself into a corner, but viewers (fans) don't care so much that the logic is flawed.  We just want to see how our clever heroes survive each week.  Mekhi Phifer made an excellent action hero and the final season blend was refreshing.  I want to see more!  Hmm. Perhaps Phifer could be the next Dr. Who!",1480291200,,748,4.544776119402985

I liked when Torchwood was working with the government and dealing with aliens but I don't like it so much when it is just about them being chased by the government.  Also, in the last two episodes I did not need to be shown gay sex, it did not need any sex gay or homosexual.  It was almost as if they needed something to fill the time.

4639712,1,B005A5IAC0,"Seriously. So bad. Such poor character development., only the original characters remain likable as they struggle through the cheesy (and not fun cheesy) scripts. New characters chew the scenery in their attempt to create something out of  the thin stereotypes they are assigned to portray (honestly, how many ""brash, boorish, homophobic, tough-guy CIA agents  who are so busy wise=cracking that they miss the vital clue"" do we really have to endure?). Dumbed down version of the witty, sexy, smart and funny series of earlier seasons. In the last 3 episodes, there's also something hinky in the sound editing, making the dialogue muddy and mumbled while action scenes and music are over modulated.

4639718,2,B005A5IAC0,"Technically, this individual Season 4 of Torchwood is the American NTSC version which will play in American BD Players.  I did not have any problems with this version playing as I did with the mixed version, four season set.  Season 4: Miracle Day of that inclusive set was released in PAL format for some stupid reason while all the others were NTSC.  Did the distributor not expect the consumer to watch all four seasons?  I went to great lengths to complete this collection before I started watching any of the episodes.  I really liked the new Doctor Who series and wanted to see more of the characters from this spinoff although the Doctor never made an official appearance other than references and sounds of a certain TARDIS.

As for the overall show itself, the continual multi-series subplot was very confusing and ruined what could have been a really good standalone sci-fi series.  There were many sex scenes with nudity.  There was also a substantial use of the F-word in the first two seasons, although it was almost eliminated by season 3 and 4.  This was definitely not a series for my nieces and nephews who are sonic screwdriver toting fans of the Doctor Who series.

The main character, Captain Jack Harkness is an immortal time traveler from the 51st century.  All people from that time period have advanced pheromones, and this supposedly makes them irresistible to all members of both sexes, but being enlightened, Jack's preference of choice is gay men.  Russel T Davies, the creator of the series, and John Barrowman, who plays Jack, are both gay.  Instead of going with the ""born this way"" theme, Jack keeps choosing relationships with both men and women and sometimes married women.  In case we were unaware of Jack's proclivities, there are several graphic gay sex scenes with nudity.  Occasionally, Jack's past wives, children, or grandchildren are integrated into the plot.  So does Jack prefer men or women?  This was a big and unnecessary distraction from the main plot.  In addition, each of the main characters in turn bedded on screen first someone of the same sex and then someone of the opposite sex.  There was even one lengthy sex scene where one hetrosexual couple was interweaved with Jack and his boyfriend trying to mimic the exact same thing.  I guess I flunked basic biology.  The show tries to explain this away with Jack's evolved futuristic pheromones and the effects he has upon normal people, but what about all the people from the 21st century unexposed to this siren's song?  They cannot seem to make up their minds either.  Overall, if you like gay eroticism disguised as enlightened sci-fi, then this series is for you.  Contact me.

4639782,2,B005A5IAC0,"The first two seasons of Torchwood were a unique and very pleasurable 5-star experience. Despite being an offshoot of Doctor Who (Torchwood is an anagram of the two-word title), the atmosphere it creates is all its own: aimed for an adult audience, with clever and convoluted plots, plenty of dry wit that only the British can interweave so seamlessly, impressive use of CGI, settings and costumes, great directing and acting, Torchwood left me completely mesmerized and absorbed into its fantastical world. In addition, the story contains many iconoclastic/sexually daring scenes that are way beyond what Doctor Who could provide for its much younger audience. But beginning with the 4th season, there is a quantum leap--or rather, fall--in the quality of the series. The partnership of Starz with the BBC shifted the center of gravity some hundreds of miles in the direction of the United States. The rich imagery and sparkling humor are gone, replaced with the typical shoot-'em-ups of American TV. Devoid of imagination, witty dialog or interesting characters, the series flops with a loud thud. From sublime the whole enterprise turns into low-brow pedestrian. What a sorry ending to a phenomenally good series.",1470614400,,1216,5.27319587628866

4639785,5,B005A5IAC0,"This season of Torchwood had a continuous story line with an interesting story.  It got a little into conspiracy organizations and had more violence than the previous 2 seasons, but they didn't go overboard with those parts of the script, so it didn't detract from the story.  The cliff hanger was amusing.  I'd really like it if the story would pick up from there.",1470009600,,365,4.671875

Miracle day is NOT the miracle it seems, in fact the rapid non-death quickly shows just what a curse eternal life might be not merely for those not dying but those being born on a planet with finite resources.

4639808,5,B005A5IAC0,While the series Torchwood itself left me less than thrilled sometimes nobody is perfect.  This particular story hit all the marks.  While Torchwood is certainly not the first to talk about the ramifications of an end to death I think this is one of the best examinations.  And the other themes were just as good.  Captain Jack is one of my favorite characters from Dr Who.  I hope we see more of him.,1469232000,,401,4.438356164383562
4639809,5,B005A5IAC0,This season brings the show to a close with a different spin as the torch wood team was whittled down after the last seasons. Some decent new characters show up and the storyline has solid twists and turns.

I think each episode stands on  its own pretty well, but I may not be a good judge of that because I watched it from Season 1, Episode 1, to the end of ""Miracle Day."" It is a modern melodrama and the slight over-acting makes the mood crystal clear ... and great fun, mostly. I love the characters, well-portrayed in all their glorious brokenness, as they struggle to save the world. I'm rather sad that it (Torchwood) seems to have ended.",1466035200,,545,4.608247422680412

4640026,4,B005A5IAC0,"It was great to see a 4th season of Torchwood.  I would love to see more seasons.  This is one of the best sci-fi shows of all time.  Miracle Day has some great parts to it, but I think it missed some of the better script writing that the first three seasons enjoyed when it was only with the BBC.  But it is still a must see for any Torchwood fan, and I would encourage Torchwood fans to also read the great books that are on Amazon. They are written by some of the original script writers for the show.",1464220800,,504,4.01

4640224,1,B005A5IAC0,"The final Russell T. Davies story from TORCHWOOD should not have been made. It's terrible from begining to end. It is an awful story which was dragged on for ten days. It could have been told in one or two. Boring American characters dominate the ten days of this story while TORCHWOOD, or what's left of it, takes a poor back seat. Most of the music, if you can call it that, is annoying. The ethos of TORCHWOOD was utterly destroyed by R.T. Davies in Children of Earth in which he destroyed what remained of TORCHWOOD following the second series in which he senselessly killed off two popular characters. Removing TORCHWOOD from Cardiff ruined the show for me. But, I wanted to see what happened so I purchased the DVD set. I wish I had not spent the money.

4640226,1,B005A5IAC0,"Do not purchase this product in any format. Miracle Day is a disgrace which should not have been made nor broadcast. People often compare American and British standards in television programs. Here we have the absolute worst of both: A British program made in the U.S.A. I'm at a loss to identify which is the worst aspect of this nightmare production. The story, the basic premise, is ""fair"". Casting, acting, and directing are mostly terrible. The original cast is subordinate to new flawed American counterparts. Actually, it feels like a British mis-interpretation of American life. The absolute worst of American TV values take center stage here. The music is HIDEOUS! Unlike music provided by Murray Gold and Ben Foster for the UK version the crap in this score is ugly, far too loud, and mostly unnecessary.

Too many characters were made into caricatures. For example, how many high ranking U.S. medical professionals these days are chain smoking tramps? The main physician in this show is a chain smoker and pretty irresponsible. The lady in red, the public relations clown, is so addicted to cigarettes she can barely hold onto the things. She's a very shallow character. Overkill.

The entire story is too dark in nature. Gratuitous homosexual scenes including male nudity are inserted without dramatic need. Russell T. Davies has a penchant for shoving his homo erotic in the faces of viewer who may or may not appreciate such things. In every case such material has nothing to do with the story. It's there merely to shock or indulge those who desire such material.

I have no understanding of why Russell T. Davies went out of his way to destroy TORCHWOOD. The first series (season in the U.S.) was charming and much of the second was better. In my opinion he set out to destroy the series. He senselessly killed off two popular characters - Tosh and Owen - in the second series. In the third series, Children of Earth, he destroyed almost everything remaining which was attractive in the program. He quickly desposed of the TORCHWOOD SUV, he blew up the main character and the entire HUB in Cardiff, made fugitives out of all of them, and later killed off the last remaining original cast member popular among fans - Ianto Jones. Since that wasn't enough to kill the series entirely he presented us with the horrid Miracle Day.",1459123200,,2342,4.85

4640232,1,B005A5IAC0,"This story is not as good as the earlier seasons. Too many loop holes in logic.

So what went wrong?

Previously killing off 3 of the 5 original characters was a huge mistake. By the time this story came around, Torchwood had lost its personality with the exit of the 3 characters.

Then there are the plot holes and illogical flaws to the story. One of the new main characters is involved in an accident. A pipe impales him through the chest and there is severe damage to a leg. A few days later, he show's up at a house walking, but collapses  in the front yard.  But a few minutes later, he's escaping and running like nothing ever happened. His chest is shown at one point, but instead of a round hole from the pipe, the wound looks like a long scratch.

Later, he is running up multiple flights of stairs. I guess his leg healed miraculously.

Gwen is punched in the face, but when she is shown a few moments later, there are NO marks or welts.

There is no explanation as to how they are getting food or water., or even new clothes. They suddenly have money to buy a computer server.

At the beginning of the story, Jack and Gwen were kidnapped and taken on a plane without luggage or carry-ons. They get off the plane without any luggage or carry ons. But later in the story, Gwen has contact lens that are also a video camera she claims she saved from the original Torchwood days. But how did the contact lens and other large equipment get here that were in the original Torchwood series? The Torchwood base had been completely destroyed previously.

Another thing that is included with this season is video clips before each episode of the creator and John Barowman separately giving a synopsis of each episode. This clips are just horrible. In one clip, we see Russell T. Davies wipe his nose on the back of his hand.

These kinds if slips in logic brought this once enjoyable show to a 2 star rating.

****SPOILER*****

This is where, after 10 episodes, you'll realize just how stupid the logic is. At the climax, it is revealed Rex had a transfusion of Jack's blood. He dies, but is brought back to life moments later, just like Jack has done a million times. A few days later at a funeral, Rex is shot dead only to gasp back to life, and everyone is shocked. Why? He just did the same thing a few days before and everyone knew he could return to life then, so why act shocked now?",1449100800,2,2393,4.362612612612613

4640238,5,B005A5IAC0,First came out Was great I have a copy of it when I download it but its worth keeping,1440374400,,85,3.526315789473684
4640239,4,B005A5IAC0,"Its 12 months since the happenings of Children of Earth. CIA operative Esther Drummond sneaks into the MI6 archives. She is looking for any old files on something called Torchwood. She finally finds one, highly redacted, but it has two photos, one of Gwen Cooper and one of Captain Jack Harkness.

The latter turns up in the archives and helps Esther escape when the guards come after her. Wouldnt you know it, Captain Jack saves her twice before they even introduce themselves. He tells her, Torchwood no longer exists. And then wipes her memory.

Why was she looking for Torchwood? All over the world, people aren't dying. They might be burned beyond recognition in a fire, but they won't die. They might be suffering incredible pain from terminal cancer, but they don't die. Its a Miracle Day, and maybe only Torchwood can solve it. If the CIA can kidnap Gwen and Jack to America.

Series 4 was produced by the American Starz network. Its 10 episodes were largely filmed in and take place in, the U.S. It is thriller sci-fi and has a lot going for it. In particular, the psychology and interactions of Oswald Danes (in an incredible performance by Bill Pullman) are outstanding. The writers also do a good job, I think, of positing the types of problems and coping that could happen if all of a sudden no one, under any circumstances, could die. And it aint pretty.

On the downside, the plot also got a little melodramatic and the ending seemed to fizzle out.

I only gave Torchwood: Series 1 three stars (could be so much more and better) but Series 2 was better. Torchwood 3: Children of Earth was incredibly good, so I had great hopes for Series 4. I would say, unfortunately, that it is back to the quality of Series 2. Not terrible, but not what Id hoped. It looks like I wasn't the only one disappointed, because its been four years and no Series 5 is contemplated.

But never say never, right? Look what happened with Doctor Who.

4640279,2,B005A5IAC0,"I'm reviewing the first episode in this new season 4. Miracle Day features choppy and bland performances by Bill Pullman and some of the rest of the crew. The only good performances come from Gwen and her husband. The dialogue is terrible here. They must have gotten an all new crew to make this. They are mostly just choking on their words.
The idea of a force that won't let anyone die is fun and terrible. I think they wanted to make some kind of suspense with lots of characters, but a lot of them are boring government agents. Nothing funny or sexy going on. They just ruined the point of the show.
The team feeling from 1-2 is not here. The photography is amateur compared to the crisp colors of season 1 & 2 (all the way back ten years ago now).
I feel really bad for liking season 1 & 2 so much and then watching this. It just seems like it lost its fun. I'm sure its none of the original people's fault. They just didn't know what to do with this after Toshiko and Owen were gone.",1424217600,,989,4.183246073298429

It's not all going to happen however many of the aspects of our reality are already here that the similarities we can't ignore. FEMA, camps with burners , the 1% out to control the world working on their plan for hundreds of years. The red and blue designations. There are many references. So if you want to know what will happen in the US in 2015-16 this will give you a bit of a preview.

4640289,3,B005A5IAC0,"Surprisingly tame for a pay cable series, they did manage to make an interesting story line though. I won't spoil the story it is a good one and one that could be looked at as being controversial but it's only controversial if you are easily offended to begin with. It's called entertainment after all and you will be entertained. Would have given it more stars but the conclusion is a little to quick for my tastes.",1420243200,,416,4.4868421052631575

4640358,5,B005A5IAC0,"I personally thought that the final season of Torchwood was its best.  A century old conspiracy based on Jack's ""unique qualities"" in which we are introduced to a far fetched yet in many ways reality based picture of what would happen to the healthcare system should it suddenly be hit with an overwhelming number of customers.  They simply took the projections of a serious worldwide epidemic and placed the root of the same house of cards folding but from a little sci-fi applied correctly.  I thought Season 5 took the writing to a new level and liked the introduction of Rex and Esther as they had their own unique bond and never say die attitude.  The only part that I don't like is that it ended on one of the great cliffhangers with the families still in place, adding a foe in addition to aliens, and with Rex as a CIA counterpart to Jack.  Unfortunately a Season 5  is as likely as my winning the powerball tonight, but each season was unique and improved from the preceding one.  I like closure, so they could pick this up at any point in the future with a season, an episode, a movie, a mini series, and it would fall in line with how things were left.  Unfortunately high levels of interest and making money don't seem to be enough to drive it to happen.  So if your considering, do it, enjoy it, it's sci fi so parts are totally unrealistic, but given it is derived from Dr. Who I'm not going to pick on quality.",1411862400,,1425,4.387832699619772

4640372,5,B005A5IAC0,"Although I didn't care for the way we Americans were portrayed (sadly, fairly accurately), the basic story in this series is frightening. Some of the ""recent"" history of Jack is painfully depicted. Power hungry humans create a way to cruelly save the lives of everyone -- nobody dies, no matter how severely ill or hurt they are. The politicians devise a plan to solve the earth's overcrowding due to the lack of deaths and ever increasing births, and that plan harkens back to Nazi Germany.

The majority of this was filmed in the US, not in Cardiff, Wales, as the previous seasons. I'm not sure that was a good thing, although we got to see that the rift in Cardiff isn't the only bad thing in the world.",1411171200,,706,4.515625

4640375,4,B005A5IAC0,"The story itself wasn't bad, but with the whole Torchwood series they seemed to promote Jack's homosexuality to the point of ad-nausea.  If they would stick to the sci-fi and not try to promote immorality, that would help focus the movie and the series on it's true focus.  I would not want to see any show that promotes the type of immorality that Jack's character represents.  That's the reason I stopped watching the show on BBCA.",1410739200,,433,4.671052631578948

4640438,4,B005A5IAC0,"This is my favorite season of Torchwood.  The first two seasons are comprised of stand alone episodes where each character gets an episode to develop their character and the aliens all come from the pages of tvtropes.  It's more adult themed than most science fiction.  Captain Jack ran Torchwood like the Romans ran their legion-- they encouraged buggery in the ranks to promote unit cohesion.  At times, the show seemed half sci fi, half orgy.  I'm exaggerating, but not by much.

Miracle Day and Children of Earth are very different.  Davies uses the science fiction series Torchwood as a vehicle for airing out his disgust at the human race.  I have a low opinion of the human race, so for me it was a stroke of genius to have as a messiah of the new world a murderous pedophile who told the family, ""she should have run faster.""  Without giving a spoiler, there was a scene in a car when Jack was handcuffed by Gwen and he told her his true feelings.  It was raw and ugly.

I don't know if Miracle Day works well as science fiction.  It has a simple premise:  No one dies and let's see how the world changes.  Though many of the changes seemed probable, they were all bitter indictments of the human race.  Much of science fiction puts a pretty mask on humanity and then tells us to look in the mirror.  Miracle Day removes the mask and underneath we see blood and muscle and bone sneering out at the world.

Most people do not like to have ugly thoughts.  They like to talk about pretty ideals.  Not all of us are wired that way.  Nietzsche wrote about an ""Apollonian"" and structured 'skin' to cover up a chaotic and ""Dionysian"" core.  Some people, full of positive and youthful energy carry ""Hillary"" signs at an event.  I'm the kind of person whose sign would read, ""Hillary-- it's about time a woman takes us to war"".

Have I scared you off yet?  If you didn't have a reactionary response to my sentiments, then you will probably enjoy Torchwood.  Be warned though, that there's a gay sex scene that goes on forever!  Spoiler:  Turns out Jack was a bottom, who knew?  But seriously, all the gay stuff greatly diminished my enjoyment of the series.  If it wasn't for the constant images of homosexual affection, I'd give it 5 stars.  I wonder if gay people think the same way about literally every other tv series?",1404950400,,2322,4.4988009592326135
4640439,4,B005A5IAC0,"What an interesting story line! Towrchwood is a top notch televeision series produced by BBC and aired in Great Britain. Wonderful actors like John Barrowman and Eve Myles portray believable characters in unbelievable circumstances. This season, Season 4, revolves around the last two members of Torchwood as they struggle against the domination of the world under the tyranny fronted by government and pharmacutical giant, Phicorp. Bill Pullman gives a creepy good portrayal of an enigmatic criminal thrust in the center of the cover-up. The creative story keeps you enthralled without dipping into cheesiness. The human issues are dealt with a caring hand.

4640461,1,B005A5IAC0,"I read the awful reviews of Miracle Day, but I bought it anyway because it was Torchwood and I wanted to see what would happen to Capt. Jack.

I discovered, however, that this isn't really ""Torchwood."" It's like a spinoff of Children of Earth, which in itself is a like a spinoff of Torchwood. Unlike the easily seasons, this isn't even canon for Doctor Who. I spent a large portion of each episode yelling at Jack to do something at least nominally scifi. They even visited Cardiff once, and I thought, ""Finally. There will be aliens, because there are always aliens in Cardiff."" Nope, apparently the rift went away.

The writers of the show seem totally aware that it's crap, too. In the second or third episode, someone complains that the lemonade has gone flat. Jack (I think it was Jack) explains that ""only the British version has fizz. The American version is flat."" Gwen deadpans, ""I think that about sums it up.""  That was probably the only moment in the whole series that I enjoyed.

*Spoliers* Oh, and I hate the Tea Party as much as anyone else, but even I was bothered by the very obvious Tea Party Concentration Camp Nazis.  Because that is the bad guy in this series. Not Weevils or sexy sexy Captain John, but Tea Partiers Holocausting people. If I wanted to hear about how the Tea Party will round us up into camps and kill us all, I'd just watch Maddow. Doctor Who and earlier series of Torchwood had very strong anti-Bush sentiment, but they put it into metaphors about aliens. Aliens are fun to watch. Torchwood is fun to watch when it's aliens and Captain Jack banging everyone. (Especially Captain John. Sexy, sexy, evil, sexy Captain John.)

4640472,4,B005A5IAC0,"I first took a Torchwood DVD out of my local library a few years ago on the recommendation of a friend who liked it. As with many science fiction shows, things started out somewhat slowly, as Torchwood and its members were introduced as sort of a ""MI-7"" team that dealt with alien invasions, trans-dimensional rifts and time anomolies. During the first series, Torchwood was a show with a kind of ""alien invasion of the week,"" approach. Butas time passed, the show began dealing with more and more serious themes and longer story arcs. What was a 5 or 6 member team has been whittled down over the years to series stars Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles).
The show relies on character development, strong writing and solid acting, and is an example of using science fiction not only to entertain and explore possible futures, but to ask questions about current controversies and issues.
In ""Miracle Day,"" something has caused people to stop dying. On its face, that may sound like a good thing, but we soon discover that not dying is not the same as living. For instance, Mekhi Phifer, a CIA agent, is impaled by a metal rod in an auto accident. He should have died, but doesn't, but is in great pain and is soon popping pain pills as if they came out of a Pez dispenser. Health-care systems are overwhelmed and it's not long before concentration camps spring up and governments begin denying rights to those who should have died.  The story develops in other ways that keep the viewer guessing and on seat's edge.",1402012800,,1546,4.6838235294117645

After losing Ianto, this is not the same at all. I read in other reviews that some people luv it, others hate it. I think I know where I'm sitting. I'm only half way through and it's taken me forever just to get to this point. While we can surmise there's alien activity somewhere behind the scenes, I agree with Jack (John Barrowman) when he states ""Torchwood should be fighting aliens, not getting involved in politics."" I agree. This season is seriously lacking. YICK. I actually had to turn my head away from some of the scenes due to the graphic nature. :( :( :(",1400889600,4,795,4.414965986394558

Big-budget American movies are pretty much devoid of such things. And American TV is just trash - no one knows how to write - how to write a really good story (Keifer Sutherland and the ""24"" team being the exception). So here in Torchwood: Miracle Day you get this kind-of spin-off of a spin-off of Dr. Who and it possess more engaging content than an entire studio full of Hollywood scriptwriters seem to be able to muster in many years.

Also, I find it a little odd that they didn't explain more of the back story since this changed channels from the BBC to Starz and presumedly picked up a few new audience members along the way.

4640493,4,B005A5IAC0,"Ok.  I love Torchwood.  I watched the entire series in a couple of months and loved every minute of it.  However, this one was just hard to get into.  It was something about the cast that was lacking.  I missed, the dark, headquarters far underground; the campy, creepy creatures from another world; and the sexual tension between all of the characters.  Maybe it was because most of the original cast had been killed off by this time, or that new characters from the US were introduced... I don't know.  I just didn't get into it - though I can say that a really classic scene is stuck in my head (Gwen holding a huge gun trying to shoot a helicopter out of the sky with her baby strapped to her chest).

4640497,1,B005A5IAC0,"After killing off almost all of the Torchwood Team in the preceding seasons, this forth and final incarnation tries to Americanize the BBC sci-fi drama in an unworthy spin off.  Torchwood's original mission is a distant memory and the storyline in this 10 part mini-series is filled with continuity errors and forgettable characters and none of the feel or excitement of the original series.  It's incongruous to me that the British TV shows like to kill off major and sympathetic characters with gusto.  Only Jack, Gwen and Reese (along with a secondary policeman) continue from the original series (because everyone else is dead). If you are a Torchwood fan you already know these things.  The mini-series Children of the Earth was grim enough, but this one tries to take grim to a whole new level.  If you were a true fan of the original series perhaps you'd be better off skipping this one--and spoiler alert--it seemed to be somewhat open ended implying they thought they were going to make another mini-series--but thankfully I can't find any references to a revival on the web.  I almost did not watch the whole series through because I wanted to find out what the mystery behind it all was--but with it's rather anti-climatic ending even that was not satisfactory.  I don't think the writers knew where the hell they were going with it all--several promising subplots were never fully developed.

Season 2 and 3 of Torchwood were excellent examples of how this combination can be done. However, Season 4 fails in that regard. The first episode had an interesting Sci-Fi plot device with the entirety of the human race not being  able to die. But besides the ""Miracle"", there is absolutely no Sci-Fi; no aliens, no awesome technology, no Sci-Fi theories. Besides the lack of Sci-Fi, the plot itself was also lackluster. The only reason I even finished the whole season was due to the each episode's cliffhangers. Cliffhangers which were no where near as exciting as they were expected to be. My advice? Stay as far away from this Season as you possibly can. Torchwood ended with Children of Earth. Miracle Day is not Torchwood.

4640536,2,B005A5IAC0,"My husband and I are fans of the Torchwood series, so we were looking forward to ""Miracle Day"". But this last arc of episodes was often tedious, at times disappointing, and occasionally offensive.

Torchwood is an arm of British intelligence that addresses alien invasions, and its leader is the intrepid , immortal Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman).  Jack is very handsome and charming. Jack was originally  a character in the Dr. Who universe, and like Dr. Who, this series is cleverly developed and fun.

But by the end of the last story arc, the Torchwood headquarters and team were destroyed. ""Miracle Day"" finds surviving Torchwood agent Gwen settled into an anonymous life with her family in rural Wales. Jack is gone, as in ""off the planet"" gone.

Then, suddenly, reality gets turned on its head: death disappears. Nobody dies.

Society edges toward collapse as the world tries to cope with an ever-expanding, never-dying population.  How did this happen, who's behind it, and how can this unnatural order be reversed?

Captain Jack reappears, Gwen gets pulled back into the fight, and they team up with two CIA agents to hunt down answers, so they can, once again, save the world.

""Miracle Day"" has lots of plot twists and unlikely characters, so it's interesting to watch as the story unfolds. It's also campy and self-mocking, which is fun. You can tell the actors really enjoy these episodes.

But I was disappointed by some of the developments in ""Miracle Day.""

Here, Captain Jack is now waaaaay out of the closet as a gay man. This has been building over the previous story-lines: his sexual preferences were hinted at, then revealed, then he launched a romance with another male Torchwood agent. Okay, Jack has supposedly lived thousands of lifetimes, so it's no surprise he's experienced much on the sexuality spectrum, and that he would currently settle into a gay lifestyle. But now he's out and proud, and snarky, and manipulative and picking up random sex partners at bars. There's a direct and strong correlation between his overt identity as a gay man and his becoming more self-absorbed and less likable.

I thought the writers handled Jack's gayness pretty well, initially. It was just one aspect of who he was. But now it's THE central fact of his life. Really? He's had millenia to get used to his orientation and behave a little bit maturely, and this is the best he can do? Do the writers--or John Barrowman, who at this point probably has a lot of creative control--think that gay people are naturally insufferable if they're allowed to be open in this regard? Kind of stereotype-y, dontcha think?

But then they attack groups that are not part of the Rainbow Revolution, or so they think.

Never mind the villainous ""Tea Party candidate"" who is crushed into a cube at a junkyard (but left alive). There are probably people who think there's no such thing as a gay Republican or conservative--just like Iran's president claimed there are no gay Iranians--but I suggest that the only people who really buy into this are liberal gays. FYI: there's a lot of diversity, even of political opinion, within the gay community, just as in the world at large. To actually NAME the Tea Party and then paint it like this is lazy and intolerant.

Far worse is the Catholic-bashing that is incorporated into this show. This is probably just as much a function of the fact that it's a British production, and a lot of Brits HATE the Roman Catholic Church, and anyone who belongs to it. (While simultaneously patting themselves on the back for their ""tolerance"" in other areas.)

The first anti-Catholic volley is fired when the issue of quality-of-life comes up in a discussion among doctors. A sentimental, weak, chubby physician advocates for the dignity of all people, but he's shot down by the glamorous whip-smart female ER doc who snaps, ""I used to be Catholic, but I got BETTER!"" See, Catholicism is a disease, and one that probably wouldn't get triaged into the ""worth saving"" category.

Not to mention, if you substitute into that scene the name of ANY religious or cultural group for ""Catholic,"" the producers wouldn't DARE leave that in the final edit.

Then we have Jack and his love affair with an Italian immigrant, Angelo, in 1920's New York.

In one scene that takes place in a Catholic church, Jack goes into a confessional and mocks the sacrament of penance. Then he has a transaction with a priest for wine, which he'll bootleg, and mocks the Precious Blood.

I can't even begin to convey how offensive this is to Catholics. That it's done with kind of a wink-wink to the audience is revolting.

But then there's the scene that follows Angelo's discovery that Captain Jack Harkness can't be killed. He can be shot through the heart, but after several minutes he'll wake up. Angelo freaks out, and tells others in his building, and soon Jack finds himself shackled to a pipe overhead while ""Ignorant Italian Immigrants"" crowd around, stabbing and shooting him to watch him die, then revive, and then they stab and shoot him again.

The whole time, the ""Ignorant Italian Immigrants"" gasp, repeatedly make the sign of the cross, catch his blood in bottles, pray aloud, and behave ridiculously. This stereotype of southern Europeans who cling to a 2000-year-old superstition is highly offensive, and I'm not even an Italian immigrant. I am surprised the Catholic League and the Sons of Italy haven't launched a protest about this. It really is over the top.

And Jack being hung up and tortured while blood runs from his wounds is a not-so-subtle reference to the Mathew Shepard case in Wyoming, where the (gay) college kid was tortured to death and then strung up on a barbed-wire fence. Making a mockery of that young man's death is disrespectful to the Shepard family and to Mathew's legacy. What happened to Mathew Shepard was NOT entertainment. Shame on the producers for letting this scene be shot.

I can't say I look forward to the next Torchwood series. I like a lot of the characters, including Jack, and I hope he tones down his act a little in the future. You can be gay AND a regular guy, you know.

And I hope the production team works on being a bit more open-minded and accepting of others who may not share their  political, religious or ethnic backgrounds. Emulating the Know Nothing Party is not cool, and doing so makes them look like jerks.",1395360000,,6397,4.813868613138686

4640564,5,B005A5IAC0,"I enjoyed Torchwood from its very first season, but I always had reservations. Torchwood worked outside the law, and was not without its fascistic side (though not quite as bad as MI-5, as presented in the series of that name). Also, although it was part of his character, I found rather irritating the frequent references to or demonstrations of Captain Jack Harkness's lighthearted sensuality. I fear, also, that creator Russell T. Davis had a strong inclination to the maudlin. The latter tendency did great harm to the third ""series,"" ""Children of Earth."" --The problem with Captain Jack *may* be due in part to Mr John Barrowman's acting abilities. He never convinces me that he is suffering, has suffered, or could suffer profoundly.
  ""Miracle Day"" still has a touch of the maudlin, but insignificantly so in light of its virtues. And there is no chance for Torchwood to be fascistic, since it is on the run throughout. As for the virtues:
  1) A truly serious science-fiction idea, treated (for the most part) seriously; one that has really serious social and human consequences and terrific dramatic possibilities.
  2) Excellent writing, a goodly part of which I gather was due to Jane Espenson.
  3) Excellent acting, particularly: the two C.I.A. agents, ""Rex Matheson"" (Mekhi Phifer) and ""Esther Drummond"" (Alexa Havins, looking like a younger Julie Benz); and especially Bill Pullman as ""Oswald Danes"" (his performance should have been Emmy-bait). Eve Myles (""Gwen Cooper"") I have always liked, and Lauren Ambrose is a delight. C. Thomas Howell is nicely threatening in a small part, and John D. Lancie is fine as an honest, hard-working senior C.I.A. something who gets blown up (I loathed him as ""Q"").
  4) Well-done, pertinent special effects; good production values throughout; nice location shooting.
  I am inclined to call this series ""sublime"" (my highest category).",1394496000,,1887,5.150819672131147

4640570,4,B005A5IAC0,"Finally got around to watching Torchwood: Miracle Day and overall I really loved it. The story was complex, with multiple storylines running throughout, which helped to maintain a steady pace for the episodes. It was great to see Captain Jack and Gwen back in action, and the additions of Rex and Ester felt comfortable and believable. It was fun seeing so many big names from the world of sci-fi in this season, such as Ernie Hudson, Nana Visitor, John de Lancie, and of course Bill Pullman. Also, I was pleasantly surprised to see Jane Espenson, one of the lead writers for Battlestar Galactica, getting several writing credits for the episodes. And, for the most part, the acting was really superb, and kept me entertained.

Having said that, because this season was co-produced by Starz, and had a US production team, it didn't feel like the Torchwood of old. This felt very American, whereas Torchwood previously felt like a UK produced show. It is hard to explain, but if you are a fan of prior seasons you will pick up on the change in tone immediately. Also, some plot points seemed to hang in the air but go nowhere, such as the idea that people were suddenly ""more alive"". It was implied that people were changing emotionally due to the Miracle, and that this change led to people becoming more sympathetic to Oswald Danes, but then that seemed to vanish as all the main characters just saw him as a vile human being. Plus, the storyline involving Gwen's father felt really tacked on and unnecessary. It felt like the writers/producers were trying way too hard to promote the Nazi genocide analogy that was being demonstrated in the story. I could have done without that story arc and still gotten the point.

Overall, it was great to see Torchwood back in action. I am hoping that the quasi-cliffhanger involving Rex will be picked up in a potential new season of the show. It would be great to see Mekhi Phifer return as a cast member for another season. I'm looking forward to seeing what the direction the show will turn next.",1394323200,,2040,4.67966573816156
4640571,2,B005A5IAC0,"You can see my review of the final season and this one echos that.  Writers strayed from the original ""alien thing"" and put to much personal stuff in a show that didn't need it, at least originally.",1394323200,,198,4.351351351351352
4640572,1,B005A5IAC0,"SPOILER ALERTS ALL THE WAY DOWN:

The show is a long love letter to socialized medicine.  Hilariously, the socialized medicine includes uncaring bureaucrats deciding from a 3 second glance if sick people (literally) go to the ovens.  The decisions are beyond appeal.  The entire show is spent complaining about private health care, all the while fighting government run medical death camps.  I'm certain that the writers have utterly no clue of the cognitive dissonance.

The plot has bigger holes than a coal mine.

If everyone is so bursting with life that they can't die, Jack would be Superman, not puny mortal.
Why didn't Jack use his magic watch to travel back in time a century to instantly heal?

Where did Angelo get nullification field technology?
Why didn't the null field let Jack instantly heal?
Why didn't Rex fall over dead in the null field? (his heart is shredded)

225 million years ago, Shanghai and Buenos Aires were part of the same landmass on the same side of the planet.  Did the aliens who built it in a U shape just plan for continental drift?  Why did they plan it to be straight now?

Who decided that police hunting for hidden category 1's had to dress up like Gestapo?
Why does the Tea Party, famously ""right to life"" to absurd lengths, suddenly become ""Dead is Dead"" cheerleaders?
If private medicine is so evil (as everybody constantly complains about)...
Why is it the *government* throwing helpless living people in ovens?
Why is one young, harried, overworked intern doctor deciding in 3 seconds who goes to the ovens?
Why is a single category 1 decision utterly beyond all appeal?
Esther changed a category 1 decision with 20 seconds of typing.  Why couldn't Molly do the same?
Why are the British so dedicated to throwing their helpless in the ovens?
Why couldn't Molly walk in and say ""I'm taking this old man off your overworked hands"" and walk out?
Why do the Brits post guards to keep people IN hospitals?
Who authorized Brit hospital guards should fire machine guns at escaping patients?

4640601,1,B005A5IAC0,"Let me start by saying that I have been a huge fan of the Doctor Who and Torchwood franchise for many years now.  Having originally watched Doctor Who, I decided to record a few of the original Torchwood series to see how they went.  The originally aired BBC series was quite gruesome and ""real.""  When it was cancelled with Children of Earth I thought it was both amazing and sad to see it go.  When Miracle Day got picked up I thought it would be a great return for American audiences.  Unfortunately it lacked in almost everything but plot.  I wanted to even give this two stars but couldn't.

Every character except for the two main, and original, characters are the best parts of stupid, arrogant, and painful.  This was written as an almost joke of British loathing of Americans.  It's like watching a racial stereotype of what many British people believe about the United States.  Every American is beyond arrogant, and they're constantly doing whatever they would like to do regardless of how dumb or what the consequences may be.  Thankfully there's the great British characters of Jack and Gwen to save the day.

The plot is a typical Russell T Davies scenario.  It's well written and has a lot of depth.  I really wanted to get into it, but unfortunately about halfway through my wife and I realized we were just watching to see the story unfold and gritting our teeth through the terrible characters that were created.  It was really like Russell Davies was told to make it an American story, and so out of spite he did make it American, but how he felt Americans were.  If you've watched Top Gear, or really any television show where they bash Americans, this is essentially hours upon hours of that stereotype played out around a plot that, under normal circumstances, could have been great.",1393286400,,1805,4.6645569620253164

There were some odd moments though: a massive government takeover of healthcare (including creation of something pretty similar to the bogeyman of ""death panels"") was an evil right wing conspiracy, beloved of the Tea Party, who really just wanted to put people in the ovens. There were also some fairly graphic sex scenes (at least by normal British sci-fi standards), both gay and hetero.

I can deal with reading my phone or tablet for a few minutes for progress.",1392854400,,405,4.075
4640621,5,B005A5IAC0,Still full of surprises. This was an awesome Mini series and I wish i could count on more but who knows. If you loved the Original series and Children of the earth then this is another for you. Great storyline and a bit freaky!,1392854400,,227,4.181818181818182
4640622,3,B005A5IAC0,"This Torchwood series lacked the cheeky humor the Brits are known for. I am not a fan of Mekhi Phifer. HIs delivery of lines is abrupt and he doesn't fit into the Torchwood family very well. I felt the ""American"" characters were forced onto the ""British"" ones and the outcome was simply oil and water.",1392854400,,301,4.490909090909091
4640623,4,B005A5IAC0,"I missed Torchwood. I did not like the last season finale. I thought it was the finale for the series and felt disappointed. It was nice to see the interaction, again protecting the earth,  renewing old friendships.",1392768000,,215,4.8108108108108105
4640624,5,B005A5IAC0,"Torchwood has all the mystery and thought provoking content of the X-Files and wonderfully ambiguous characters who find themselves in the middle of challenging and tormenting physical and emotional situations.  The characters work hard and play really hard.  Well-balanced writing, good plot lines, and super fun to watch.  I especially like being able to watch as much of a season as I like in one session and really enjoy getting it free through my Amazon Prime membership.  Go, Amazon.  Any more Captain Jack planned for the future? I know, I failed to specify which future.  Then again, there's always the past.  Limitless possibilities.",1392768000,,642,5.174757281553398
4640625,4,B005A5IAC0,"It was a pleasant discovery, finding Torchwood still around.  I have not kept up with television in some time, but running across the series on DVD has given me a pleasant diversion, without the intrusion of a salesman with his foot in my brain that TV leaves me feeling.
The fact that the individual episodes are only parts of the story told over a ""season"" is not a problem when you have access to the whole of the ""season"" at once.
The plot keeps one seeking the ultimate solution.  The characters are well written and well played. This is Sci-Fi at a more believable level.  Torchwood is a ""What If?"" series that plays well without all the SFX and CGI usually found on the screen.
I recommend looking into the collection if you haven't been previously exposed to it.",1392768000,,770,4.525179856115108
4640626,3,B005A5IAC0,"I loved the old Torchwood, and watched every episode. But this newest  one doesn't have what the old one had. The characters made the show and most are missing here. And this Miracle Day theme, just went on and on and didn't have much action. I got tired of watching long before it ended. Hope others enjoy it more than I did.",1392768000,,326,4.258064516129032
4640627,2,B005A5IAC0,"Inconsistent.  Just one example:  A person gets his head cut off and retains consciousness and another gets crushed up in a car crusher and also retains consciousness.  But someone has a heart attack and becomes a 'category 1'.  I hate when shows overlook simple stuff.  You don't just have to suspend belief, but accept poor writing.",1392768000,,334,4.892857142857143

4640629,4,B005A5IAC0,I'm a fan since Dr. Who. So my rating may be a little biased.  I was sincerely thrown back when one of the actors was killed off. She seemed to have a future with her character.,1392681600,,177,3.9166666666666665
4640630,5,B005A5IAC0,"I really enjoyed the latest installment to the Torchwood franchise; while I agree with some of the other reviewers that the deceased characters (Ianto, Tosh, and Owen) are missed, it is a really good story.
The new characters add a lot to the plot, and let's face it, Bill Pullman (of Independence Day) played a stellar bad guy.",1392681600,,328,4.672413793103448
4640631,4,B005A5IAC0,I enjoyed Torchwood: Miracle Day; action pacjed and thrilling.  I had to go back to watch the other seasons.  I hope there will be more seasons.,1392681600,,144,4.5
4640632,5,B005A5IAC0,"The premise is quite interesting, acting was good. It was interesting to see how the female lead handled having more than just a boyfriend/husband at home. The way they depicted society eventually having to accept the holocaust events brought home how some Europeans must have accepted the same deeds on their watch during WWII.",1392681600,,328,5.092592592592593

4640640,4,B005A5IAC0,"This Sci-fi program was better than I expected. I was pretty impressed with both the writing and the acting. Though special effects have been minimal, they have been very good quality. I watched the pilot and will definitely be checking out some more episodes. I only gave it 4 stars cause I haven't seen how well they will develop the plot.",1392508800,,341,4.60655737704918
4640641,3,B005A5IAC0,"The plot was good, but the middle to ending led to a somewhat less eventful reveal. There were too many long sex scenes as usual if you need those in your movie or series the potential of the over all quality of the product being good is low. The long drawn out sex scenes made the series at times seem like a late night cable soft core porn series.

But still Captain Jack and Torchwood carried the day and Miracle Day is a good watch just not for kids under 14 without parents because of violence, some gore and a couple of long semi nude sex scenes.",1392508800,,552,4.158878504672897

4640644,4,B005A5IAC0,Great show enjoyed how the story progressed. Characters were good ...enjoy the action and ending was great.  Would be great if they had more esposides.,1392422400,,151,5.04
4640645,5,B005A5IAC0,The show felt like it was setting up for a new season towards the end I still enjoyed watching Captain Jack and remaining team from Torchwood at work. I do hope there are additional seasons in the work. Some episode are even better then past episodes. Overall if you liked Torchwood this a good addition. But you will still miss the team members who are no longer with us.,1392422400,,372,4.405797101449275
4640646,5,B005A5IAC0,"I had the best fun watching the series start and then the last season so disconnected and definitely not fun..I didn't get  that feeling  of ""what is next"" feeling and wanted the old team to stay together...Boo...Hiss on the last series...K from San Diego",1392422400,,255,4.7727272727272725
4640647,2,B005A5IAC0,"could have been good.  Seems to go too par to promote certain agendas and the story ends up too fragmented.  The cute blond kind of saves it for a while.  The British female seems a little over the top, lacking finesse in her acting.",1392336000,,233,4.25

4640649,3,B005A5IAC0,"So not giving away any plot and if you know Torchwood then you know how it goes.  The gay is over the top this time so hide your children if you do not want them seeing man butt and sausage.  Lots of man on man kissing too.  Premise is less depressing than Children of Earth and not over the top attacks on Christianity but they are still there.  If you love watching Gwen Cooper crying then this is the series to watch...she can't help but make the ugly face and cry at the drop of a hat.  If you like watching Jack die as every series they kill him and he uses his death all the time as a crutch well this one is a bit more tame and he only is killed like 10 times or so during this series and for once it seems to make sense why he is being killed.

Get your Sci-Fi fix but not a lot more...",1392249600,,794,3.8404907975460123

4640655,4,B005A5IAC0,"I really did enjoy this season.  However be advised that there are scenes that are definitely not suitable for younger viewers.  Ditto for those that are homophobic or those that feel uncomfortable watching gay love scenes.  Personally, it did not bother me, but I know that it will some.  I do feel it was a little too intense, but I would say the same if it were a man and woman.  (yes, label me as a semi-prude if you wish) Please note, there were only two episodes that had this ""erotica"" (for lack of a better term), the rest did not.

Without offering spoilers, the season deals with something occurring that causes people all over the world to stop dying. (the ""miracle"").  Gwen, Captain Jack, and two American CIA agents join forces to find the cause.",1392163200,,759,4.536764705882353

4640669,2,B005A5IAC0,"If you're a fan of the Torchwood series, don't watch this. The acting is good, but didn't seem true to the characters as much as it should have been, especially given that we only have two of the Torchwood team members left. The storyline was ridiculous.

4640685,4,B005A5IAC0,"Not your average Sci-fi tale, a very open minded series. You really need to find and watch the Dr. WHo episodes that made Captain Jack Harkness immortal and unable to die and then the episode about the founding of Torchwood.

The ""secret agents"" are incredibly careless about breaking cover. One potentially story-changing piece of supertech (the Null Field Generator) is introduced and then immediately discarded by the characters.

4640692,4,B005A5IAC0,"At times there is nothing to watch on regular TV? In my search for something I found this BBC series. So far I watched the first 2 episodes of the newest season and then went back and started at the beginning with season 1! Very unusual story line with a nice blend of drama, suspense and science fiction. Good character development also adds to the story. I am enjoying them. I do NOT like nudity, sex and horrible language in what I watch. I have had to leave one episode partially watched due to nudity? I have totally skipped another for that reason too. There have been some use of unacceptable words but not to the point I turned it off. I would have much preferred they left them all out of course!

Warning:  there is adult content that you do not want a child to see--sexually explicit.  i enjoyed the story, and felt it had much the flavor of Dr. Who. where Capt. Jack Harkness was first introduced (at least to me).  The concepts of nobody ever dying and the subsequent consequences were interesting, and some peoples solutions were horrifying.  I like being made to think.",1391212800,,442,4.615384615384615
4640701,1,B005A5IAC0,"The show has potential if they focused more on writing a good plot and more believable characters.

The writers seem more intent on showing gay-porn vs sci-fi. It is too bad that homosexuality (or any sexuality) has to be the staple of what is suppose to be sci-fi show. I would feel just as disturbed if they focused on heterosexual porn vs sci-fi. If I want to watch pornography I would do so. I want to watch science fiction.

So shame of the writers of this program as well as the directors and producers. Keep your porn (gay or not) to yourself vs polluting my eyes with it.",1391126400,2,579,4.351851851851852

4640711,1,B005A5IAC0,I started watching without seeing the previous seasons.  The show was interesting and I was enjoying the first few shows till the main guy...went into a bar and picked up a guy.....at first I thought it was something along the lines of getting information from the guy.  But then they showed a scene with these two guys making out....then shortly after they showed these two guys in bed humping.  That was enough to turn me off of this show and I will not watch it.  I do not understand why Hollywood (or the British equivalent) has to insert things like this that has nothing to do with the story or add anything to the show.  It is a free country and they can add stuff like this in the movies.....and people can do what they want in their own private lives...but I don't want to watch it.  Stupid show.....,1390953600,,809,4.395973154362416

They could easily reboot with new characters and have an amazing run with great stories. Like doctor who, all they need is the magnificent and wondrous universe with all diversity to bring in new and interesting protectors of Earth. Although they had no super powers, the team was able to function well with the technology. I think a reboot and continuation of the TORCHWOOD story is in order.",1390953600,,487,4.609195402298851
4640718,3,B005A5IAC0,I had been looking forward to seeing this since I was not able to watch it when it was on Starz.  I enjoyed the first few episodes when the team was grappling with a progressively larger and larger puzzle.  What was disappointing was the way in which the ultimate climax and confict resolved.  It ended in too convenient of a manner for such a grand concept.,1390867200,,358,4.393939393939394

4640721,3,B005A5IAC0,"The miniseries format is great. It keeps your attention, is easy to follow and wraps up nice and tidy. No death!  So tired of shows where death, doom and gloom are the theme. I like that it's based on an fresh, interesting concept of exploring worldwide immortality rather than the run of mill overdone typical sci fi shows. However, the first few episodes don't really connect to the plot. Probably could have done it all in 2 or 3 episodes but was stretched to 10. Was hoping for a little more, but still entertaining.",1390867200,,520,4.531914893617022
4640722,3,B005A5IAC0,"As a longtime Torchwood and Doctor Who fan, I had put off watching Miracle Day for a long time due to all of the negative reviews I had read from fellow fans.  I had heard that it felt nothing like Torchwood, that it had been ""Americanized"", that there were new characters and that Captain Jack and Gwen had basically been marginalized in the series.  Due to having such low expectations going in to my viewing, I was very pleasantly surprised.  Jack and Gwen are very much the lead characters, and heroes of this series.  Yes, there are several other characters; there would have to be...the rest of the Torchwood team has been killed off, you can't very well have a series this long and complex with only two characters. And no, it doesn't ""feel"" very much like the original Torchwood.  It doesn't take place in Cardiff, it takes place in America.  It wasn't made on a BBC budget for the BBC audience, Starz was involved, and the American market was targeted.  It had a much different feel....but I enjoyed it.  No, I didn't enjoy it the way I enjoyed the other seasons of Torchwood, and if they ever do anything like this to Doctor Who, I may become suicidal, but for a series that seemed to have ended, I will admit, they didn't do a bad job.  The story line left much to be desired!  It started out interesting, but the resolution was completely nonsensical and irrational...because, you know, everything dealing with immortality normally is rational and sensible!  I won't go into my issues with the plot, you can all hash that out for yourselves.  I will just say that this is pretty pleasing if you go into it with very low expectations.",1390867200,,1645,4.57679180887372

4640724,2,B005A5IAC0,While it is an amusement park ride of SCI FI fun with many familiar faces it lacks so much in the way of consistency both in terms of the previous Jack Harness and Torchwood storyline and in its own internal storyline that it is really just not a very good story.  Too many plot holes to have been drawn out over 10 episodes.,1390867200,,325,4.158730158730159
4640725,4,B005A5IAC0,"Watched in in a week. Definitely worth watching. It starts out kinda weird but it does get better.

4640727,1,B005A5IAC0,I love the story line and sci- fi world in this show. Great actors and love how they are crossing ocean into US. I had to stop watching and supporting this show because of the graphic homosexual sex. It is so unnecessary for the story line. The fact that the male lead is gay is not the problem. It's the visuals that are just plain nasty and I will not support by watching.,1390867200,,374,4.136986301369863

4640732,3,B005A5IAC0,"Thoroughly enjoyed the original Torchwood series. Loved Captain Jack and his invincibility. This series starts off with Captain Jack being human.

I have loved John Barrowman from the first moment I saw him and Eve Myles has a tough beauty that I find captivating.  I love it when she states her Welsh proclivity for action before words.  The other stars deserve comment too, but I can't remember their names.  The entire cast was a perfect foil for the dynamic duo of Gwen and Jack.

4640761,4,B005A5IAC0,"I've enjoyed the previous three series of Torchwood, and was waiting for Miracle Day to arrive on Demand. This Showtime version brings the remains of the team (John Barrowman and the ever interesting Eve Miles) to the USA and adds Mekhi Phifer as a government agent. I really like Phifer, but I have to say he has some of the worst lines in the show, especially where he videos himself spilling the beans about the government cremations centers. My favorite is when he tells Category 1's (comatose patients) to avoid the centers, how I don't know.

Since it is Starz there's more sex, especially between Capt Jack (Harkness) and his male paramours. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the sheer ambition, what happens if people simply stop dying? Government response and that of individuals are both realistic and chilling, and the series explores them well. There's even a twist ending (well, two of them)in the ultimate world saving moment and after the funeral (true to BBC habits not all the main characters live). And there's a hint of continuing the story, although Russell T Davies put the series on ""Indefinite hiatus"" in late 2012.

Oh yes, Bill Pullman plays a smarmy, slimy child killer reprieved by the miracle, redeeming himself at the end for the American audiences, and the delightful Lauren Ambrose as a PR specialist, who generates one of the best lines of the movie - during the climax, while fighting to control an elevator, Eve Myles looks at her and says ""How can you wear so much lipstick!!!!!"".

4640768,2,B005A5IAC0,"I loved the first series.  Although a bit dark, it was hopeful and the characters were given a story line that allowed them to develop and have interesting interactions.  Honestly, I think Miracle Day is horrible.  I love John Barrowman, so I force myself to watch it, but the series is too violent and imparts a sense of hopelessness.",1389916800,,335,4.6440677966101696
4640769,1,B005A5IAC0,"You know, Torchwood is a great concept...and most of the time, it's a great sci-fi show.  EXCEPT...for all the times that it isn't!

Hey, there's way, WAY too much in the way of unnecessary and completely extraneous distractions in here...and they're pretty much all about sex.  WOOO HOOO, so I'm a freak on sex on TV [or, so some will say!].

The problem is, the sex scene insertions don't advance the plot in ANY way...and are way, way beyond appropriate.

If you don't want your kids asking some detailed questions about gay sex (in particular, because that is what is most focused on)...then don't let them watch this show.  If you don't want your daughter to get the idea that casual recreational sex is just fine, even expected of women...don't let her watch this show.

Torchwood, this is a self-inflicted wound!!  You're back on my forever-banned list.",1389830400,3,860,4.802721088435374

4640775,5,B005A5IAC0,"Sort of a guilty pleasure for me. This is a British (BBC) series similar to Dr. Who. Sort of a SciFi fantasy. The characters are great, and I love the ""non-touristy"" views of Wales and London.",1389744000,,192,4.361111111111111

4640780,3,B005A5IAC0,"There are those that have said that this series ran too long, and would have been much better with 5 or 6 episodes instead of ten. I agree. It's good to see at least part of the Torchwood gang back together, but it felt like the writers were trying to stretch things out to make ten episodes instead of good writing. Just my 2 cent's worth.",1389657600,,340,4.166666666666667

I like Capt Jack going around universe banging aliens and whatnot, but noone needs a naked queer scene over and over again... we get it... you poop rainbow gerbils and like it...

4640787,4,B005A5IAC0,"Torchwood (original BBC series) was very neat and I liked the interesting story line and background of Capt. Jack and everyone. This spin off of Doctor who is indeed interesting. But I digress. I am reviewing Miracle Day. I thought it was good. Love that quirky Gwen. Cant get over that cockny accent! Interesting Storyline (Noone Dies!) Very Cool ending. They left it open to more series/movies and I am interested to see where it goes from here. Been  while since the tv show. Didn't fully stay true to flow of the original, in my opinion, but still not bad, so 4 stars. For those of you who may not know, Capt. Jack is Bi (in the series), or possibly gay, thought there are some feelings between him and Gwen (you only ever see him with men, though) SO, some homosexuality is present. Rather disconcerting to me too, I just fast forwarded/skipped.",1389571200,,850,4.592105263157895

4640792,5,B005A5IAC0,"Disappointed way the series ended. This had more Adult content that could have been out. Still give the season 5 stars. I watched the session in 2 nights a lot of suspense, action, sci-fi, and thriller.",1389484800,,202,4.638888888888889

4640801,3,B005A5IAC0,"I thought it was okay.  Again I like sci-fi movies, etc.  However, they changed the characters in Torchwood.  I guess they are trying to put an American spin on the series, which I do not like.  I don't think that this is a series that would take off in America like the ""X Files"".  I like Torchwood as being strictly Canadian or U.K.  That's what makes it unique.

I guess I would recommend the series to all the people that enjoy a good sci-fi movie/show.",1389225600,,457,4.305882352941176

4640805,4,B005A5IAC0,I really enjoyed what I hope is not the ending of Torchwood.  They left me wanting more and hopefully they will continue.  The new characters were ok but not really explored as well has they could have been.  My biggest complaint is that they tried to squeeze too much into too little space and time.  The ending was completely unexpected and came to a wrap all too fast.  I will watch it again but really hope they do another season whether it be in America or back in the UK.,1389225600,,477,4.2555555555555555

4640809,3,B005A5IAC0,"I am a long time Doctor Who fan and somewhat enjoyed the original Torchwood, but this version goes just a bit too far out of its way to not only show that Jack prefers men, but it also includes him in full length sex scenes that leave little to the imagination. I have no issues with anyone preferences, but I watch shows like Doctor Who and Torchwood  for the sci-fi, not the T&A or in this case the D&A. I suggest they tone down those aspects a little and stick to the story. For me, sex in sci-fi breaks the flow of the story and makes the whole experience less enjoyable.",1389225600,,575,4.18018018018018
4640810,5,B005A5IAC0,Classic Torchwood.  If you like the original series what is there not to like about this short story arc version.  No spoilers but they rebanded with a bit of american help to find out why no one dies.,1389225600,,201,4.2631578947368425
4640811,4,B005A5IAC0,"I loved the concept of the story: the implications of no death while aging, illness, pain and suffering still continues. How this will be exploited by companies and governments?

4640824,3,B005A5IAC0,"I watch torch wood for scifi, including monsters or aliens.  I get the message that humans can be monsters, but the scifi story underlining the series was sadly weak compared to the everyday conspiracy story that dominated the series.",1389139200,,234,5.0
4640825,4,B005A5IAC0,"I thought Torchwood died after the third season or so.  I was surprised to see this one get listed on Amazon.  The production has really moved away from the earlier amaturish feel and offers a much more refined look and feel and flow to it.

Now that I'm further into it, I am growing to like the new characters so I guess you could say that the writing and acting are 4 star worthy because they have sucked me in. it's not the original Torchwood, but it is worth watching.",1389052800,,356,4.1

4640832,4,B005A5IAC0,"I was not impressed with the first several episodes, because it was hard to reproduce the creativity and comradery of the original Torchwood cast and episodes.  However, I have to say the final episode was fantastic!  The characters and plot improved over time, and the old Torchwood excitement returned.  I sincerely hope a Season 5 is in the works.

The result is a bit long-winded -- could have been 6 episodes to cover

condition that works so well.  This, in contrast to that horrible ""Childhood""
year which stepped over the line into dark disgusting ""why did I watch this""

4640848,4,B005A5IAC0,Bet good show. I like the new characters and how they blend with the current cast. The story line was weird and interesting.,1388793600,,124,4.434782608695652
4640849,4,B005A5IAC0,"Inventive show, definitely not for the kiddies! Would have given five stars if Jack had been the focal point. Regardless, it was entertaining.",1388793600,,142,5.217391304347826
4640850,5,B005A5IAC0,"This is classic sci-fi television.  As someone who watched the first Star Trek, I am addicted to good sci fi of any kind, and this is it; I only wish there were going to be more!!!!",1388793600,,181,4.027777777777778
4640851,4,B005A5IAC0,"I haven't made a successful transition to the new Torchwood yet,but I think I will.  The old series was great and this looks promising.  The right characters survived.",1388793600,,167,4.928571428571429
4640852,3,B005A5IAC0,"I liked the first 3 seasons better. Maybe it is me, but the plot never really enticed me; did not care for last few episodes & ending.",1388793600,,134,4.0
4640853,5,B005A5IAC0,"I can not say much without spoiling the plot but I will say I found myself captive to the plot needing to watch episode after episode.

I has the right mix of conspiracy theories, and brings to life the worst fears of those who fear what could be if government is left unchecked.",1388793600,,279,4.264150943396227
4640854,5,B005A5IAC0,"OMG I never saw this before, definitely my new favorite,.Very addicting series.  I want to see more, want more, want more.",1388793600,,122,4.809523809523809
4640855,5,B005A5IAC0,I never got into Dr Who but I really enjoyed this spin-off. I love the characters and I love the way the BBC produce their TV series. Highly recommend it.,1388793600,,154,4.166666666666667
4640856,4,B005A5IAC0,"This series started out pretty oddly, but got better and better...besides, what's not to love about Torchwood?  Go, John Barrowman!",1388793600,,131,5.55
4640857,3,B005A5IAC0,"This series has always been quirky (and original). But the storyline is still depressing. Not a moment of humor and joy, just a steady onslaught of bad-to-worse world-ending activities.",1388793600,,185,5.413793103448276
4640858,3,B005A5IAC0,of course not it's as good as the original. It will entertain you if you have nothing else to do.,1388793600,,97,3.9
4640859,5,B005A5IAC0,Excellent Movie cannot wait for part two of Miracle Day. I it's soon. I would recommend this movie to all!!!,1388793600,,108,4.45
4640860,5,B005A5IAC0,"Not quite as good as season 3; but ""Miracle Day"" still holds up to repeat viewings. Too bad there doesn't seam to be a season 5 coming because season 4 certainly leaves it open for more.",1388793600,,186,4.194444444444445
4640861,4,B005A5IAC0,"Love the first one. After that the next couple are kind of as let down,i'm going to watch the rest just to see if it gets better",1388793600,,128,3.7777777777777777
4640862,4,B005A5IAC0,Miracle Day adds an interesting twist to Jacks story and is fun to watch. It is best watched as a miniseries however as its connection with the original torchwood story line isn't very strong,1388707200,,191,4.647058823529412
4640863,4,B005A5IAC0,"Each episode was very good and suspenseful.  Bit much though on the gay scenes though, as that was the only kind of intimate encounters that happened.",1388707200,,150,4.769230769230769
4640864,5,B005A5IAC0,good development of the characters--make you think--what would happen if no one died--would be a big mess who knows what would happen,1388707200,,133,5.090909090909091
4640865,1,B005A5IAC0,"I've never been a fan of Torchewood, but I was hoping because my love for Doctor Who, and once again this disappointed me.",1388707200,,122,4.3478260869565215
4640866,5,B005A5IAC0,I have missed this show. It ended poorly and left you in a sad spot. This show lulled you back and was a keep you guessing thrill. Really enjoyed the episodes. Watched the entire season in one day. Just couldn't stop. Cannot wait for more. .,1388707200,,241,4.260869565217392
4640867,4,B005A5IAC0,"I have not watched it enough to really have a better opinion but so far it look fine.
I will continue watching it",1388707200,,113,3.9565217391304346
4640868,5,B005A5IAC0,For a serious Sci-Fi it is one of the best. I would recommend this to anyone. One does need to start at the beginning of the series and go in order so everything in plot line can be understood.,1388707200,,193,3.9743589743589745
4640869,5,B005A5IAC0,"Of course, I think ALL Torchwood stories are fine. I could live without the homosexuality, but the performances throughout are excellent.",1388707200,,137,5.571428571428571
4640870,5,B005A5IAC0,"Great mix of futuristic, pharmaceutical and good over the unethical. The actors work great together and the all have a family connection with someone..",1388707200,,151,5.333333333333333
4640871,5,B005A5IAC0,"I am addicted to this series and wish it will continue. You never know what is going to happen next. The main characters flawed, and I love that.",1388707200,,145,4.214285714285714
4640872,5,B005A5IAC0,"love torchwood. wish the series was still on.  Its not part of this season, but my all time favorite episode is Gwen's wedding,",1388707200,,127,4.521739130434782
4640873,5,B005A5IAC0,"I tried watching many of these as individual episodes, sometimes out of order and was disappointed I couldn't get into it. I love Captain Jack and Gwen and many of the guest actors, but until I watched it serially at one go, I could not lose myself in the whole story and really enjoy it.",1388707200,,288,4.254545454545455
4640874,4,B005A5IAC0,"This season looked at Death squarely. And with enough ""sci-fi"" to it that it could be thought of as a reality at some point in the near future.",1388707200,,143,4.142857142857143
4640875,3,B005A5IAC0,"Heavy emphasis on sexual encounters, both gay and straight, did nothing for this season of Torchwood but make it not safe for the kids.  Eve Myles performance was consistently brilliant.  While John Barrowman did a good job, his character seemed to lack depth this season and was reduced to snarky one liners with potential bedmates.  Not at all surprising that Torchwood series went on indefinite hiatus after this run, which is really sad as the first couple of seasons were brilliant.",1388707200,2,487,4.987654320987654
4640876,4,B005A5IAC0,I thought this was a very good show I liked the plot and storyline.  I wish there was another season,1388707200,,100,4.0
4640877,5,B005A5IAC0,Having been a long time fan of this DOCTOR Who spin-off. Was very glad to see the gang back. The storyline is provocative and compelling. Looking forward to the next season,1388707200,,172,4.580645161290323
4640878,4,B005A5IAC0,Much better than the original Torchwood. Better acting and story line. I was actually interested to see where things were going. I found the original like a bad Dr. Who.,1388707200,,169,4.666666666666667
4640879,5,B005A5IAC0,"I love Torchwood, I love Doctor Who, I love just about anything the BBC craps out.  It surpasses most American television to say the least.  With that said, the first two seasons were the best, and I only give Miracle Day five stars because it was the last hurrah.",1388620800,,264,4.36734693877551
4640880,3,B005A5IAC0,Streaming and sound were great. The story was okay and I wanted to finish the series. Barrowman is my favorite. It is not the old Torchwood though.,1388534400,,147,4.481481481481482
8463207,5,B005A5IAC0,Super cool story,1520553600,,16,4.666666666666667
8463208,5,B005A5IAC0,"It's much better the second time around. Plus - CAPTAIN JACK! What is there not to love!

Odd format with commentary before each of the episodes, but it's easy enough to skip through that so you don't have the spoiler thing going on. Must be an American thing.",1515369600,,260,4.416666666666667
8463209,3,B005A5IAC0,"if your invested into the series kind of need it to finish the story.
Was not a huge fan. Cool idea but seemed forced to wrap it up at the end.",1513641600,2,143,3.6451612903225805
8463210,4,B005A5IAC0,"Okay. Here is the thing. We really like Torchwood. REALLY. (sans Random Shoes) And before you ignore this because you think it's anti Miracle Day- it's NOT. We have cyberbullied people for being anti Miracle Day. But listen. Listen. We just finished this season for probably the 900th time and what the ****. What the ****???????

Also. It would have been better if throughout the show there was a small minecraft pig with Greg Austin's (the actor not the country musician) face on it. Everyone would think he's really cute. Okay.",1512950400,,530,4.824175824175824
8463211,5,B005A5IAC0,"I enjoy watching it, again and again.",1510704000,,37,4.428571428571429
8463212,3,B005A5IAC0,"If you are a Doctor Who fan and want to get into this show, know that it is NOT family friendly. Do not let your kids watch this. Explicit contents. Featuring both heterosexual and homosexual sex scenes. Saw the first few episodes on season 4, it was rather interesting, until explicit contents show up while watching it with the family. Call it quit.",1504569600,,351,4.587301587301587
8463213,5,B005A5IAC0,excellent,1504224000,,9,9.0
8463214,1,B005A5IAC0,"As much as I have always loved Torchwood and Dr. Who, this was terrible. Boring, poorly written and a waste of good talent. Skip Schoolnik did Buffy as I recall and other great shows,  but  bringing this British gem to the U.S. was a bad idea.",1501372800,,243,4.260869565217392
8463215,5,B005A5IAC0,"This is a great extension of the Torchwood series. The story line, acting, and production values were very good and a great compliment to the original series. For all the bad reviews, I think it mainly is a complaint that Miracle Day was too much of an American intervention into the British series.",1500681600,,299,4.660377358490566
8463216,4,B005A5IAC0,"as one reviewer already said, this season lacked the wit and character development of the real Torchwood and a lot of the same old - 'it's your fault, Jack."" - totally ridiculous.
but it was enjoyable, nonetheless.  the actors, as usual, were incredibly good - the CIA guy really gave it his all - there was a complex person developed from not a lot in the script.  the actress who played the PR person was superb.  and the actor who played Dain -the so-called bad guy, was just amazing - how intricate he played it emotionally -  watched to see how he play the Dain as it went on. . .  the actress who played the CIA computer person developed her character beautifully.  All the actors were wonderful.  and the direction cinematography were quite good, also.  too bad the two main Torchwood characters didn't get anything to do but repeat the same over and over.  had to watch though - as the plot was really good - how fascism takes hold and people react. . .",1499126400,3,961,4.4147727272727275
