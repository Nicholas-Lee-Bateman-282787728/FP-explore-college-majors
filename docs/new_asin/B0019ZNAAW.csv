8275664,1,B0019ZNAAW,"While Behind Green Lights is a very good movie, this DVD is not. It is a shame that a Carole Landis film has fallen to this disarray and people actually selling it in this poor condition. Whats even worse, is that the ""download"" available from Amazon, is the exact same horrible copy.",1283126400,,284,4.480769230769231
8275665,4,B0019ZNAAW,"Not the best movie ever made, and was probably beneath Carole to take a part for, but she as always lights up the screen whenever she's on camera! She's one of the most talented, most beautiful, and most sexy of all the actresses of the 1940's!",1255305600,,244,4.326086956521739
