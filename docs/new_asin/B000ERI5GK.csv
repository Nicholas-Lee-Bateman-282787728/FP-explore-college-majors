8113514,5,B000ERI5GK,"The Fugitive, 1994 film

The film opens with a woman being attacked; it is the wife of Dr. Richard Kimble. The police take the husband in for questioning. They had been at an event, and Dr. Kimble was called to the hospital, leaving his wife alone. There was an attack by a one-armed man; his wifes death leaves him rich. Dr. Kimble is convicted for her murder and sentenced to death. (This is based on the 1960s TV series.) The surprise in this movie is not in the ending, but the events that lead to the ending. The legend of a surgeon wrongly convicted is based on the real case of Dr. Sam Sheppard. As an action suspense story, this is excellent! [It is set in the Chicago area, perhaps because Cleveland would have no part of this story.]

Deputy Marshal Gerard shows up to personally take over the investigation, and search for the fugitive. Dr. Kimbles escape in cold weather reminds me of the similar escape of Rambo. Dr. Kimble hides in the urban jungle. The pacing keeps the fugitive one jump ahead of his pursuers. When he is trapped in the tunnel, Dr. Kimble goes underground (literally). Gerard is relentless for a man who doesnt care. Dr. Kimble escapes with a desperate leap into the air. We then follow Dr. Kimble as he attempts to search for the real killer, like in a detective story. There is exciting action until the final minutes when Justice triumphs.

This story was updated to reflect the business world of the 1990s, and its many scandals. Professional rivalry could not be mentioned in the 1960s (between Cleveland General Hospital and the small clinic owned by the Sheppard family). This is a film that can be watched and enjoyed every year. I wonder if that ethnic neighborhood was chosen for some significance? The parade in the street reminded me of the scene in Blow Out or The Net. The film does not tell of Dr. Kimbles future. Will Dr. Kimble face the same problems that Dr. Sheppard faced after his acquittal? We hope not. It will take another court case to reverse the first verdict.

The real story of Dr. Sam Sheppard is better than any movie or novel. F. Lee Bailey said anyone who is a suspect should immediately get the best defense lawyer around. Would a pharmaceutical company take such desperate action to hide the bad effects of its proprietary medicine? It would be liable for millions for producing a harmful medication. All medicines have side effects, that is why they are controlled substances. Is there any independent testing of a new medication? What is the FDAs policy. After this watch Wrongfully Accused, a parody of this story.",1431993600,,2584,4.647702407002188
