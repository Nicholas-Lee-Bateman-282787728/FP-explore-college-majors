8275351,5,B0019USGH4,"My son Julian loves this movie!  Julian has autism and has always had a fixation with fish, dolphins and anything that swims.  Mickey the maker of the film Soul Fish used music from my band The Whys throughout the movie.  When you combine Julian's love of fish with his Daddy's music you have a winner.  Doesn't hurt that there are world-class fishermen and amazing exotic locations to boot.  Soulfish will always be a part of our family and even though we have worn through several copies due to overuse and too much attention we keep buying more and chalk it up as the cost of doing business.  Buy it!  You don't need a personal connection to feel the love of fishing, food, music and life in this film.  Keep it real Mickey we love your work.

8275352,3,B0019USGH4,Good footage and nice fish.  Great locations with character.  I would recommend this to the fly addict who loves watching adventure type content.  Dialogue is a little weak.,1323216000,,173,5.107142857142857
8275353,5,B0019USGH4,An awesome dvd taking you to remote areas to view flyfishing at it's very best. From Mongolia to the Florida keys this video offers the viewer an insight into a sport growing by leaps and bounds. A must have!,1243814400,,208,4.358974358974359
