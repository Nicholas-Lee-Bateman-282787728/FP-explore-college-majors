8198805,5,B000R4GVIO,"Myself and a few dozen of my friends are avid S Factor fans.  Many of us have not only purchased the DVD sets, but we also attend classes at the local S Factor studios in LA, the various retreats, and have even invested in a pole for practicing at home.  If your budget and location allow it, I highly suggest taking in studio classes prior to trying the DVD's.  The instructors are extremely helpful and encouraging.  If you can swing it, I also highly recommend the retreats- they are truly life-changing.",1483228800,,507,4.538461538461538

8198807,5,B000R4GVIO,"Ladies, don't miss the true gift of this instruction.

This isn't about becoming a sexy gymnastic contortionist or about performing for someone else. It's far deeper than that. It's about connecting deeply with your erotic creature and your feminine power. Just for yourself. It takes something to touch your own body in the spirit of exploration and love, owning your ""power and beauty"", as Sheila puts it.

You may feel awkward or bashful at first doing these slow, ""boring"" moves. (Once you're really into it and feeling like being magnanimous, you can show a man one or two of these moves and you'll see how boring they are when he goes utterly catatonic.) If you do it with a friend, resist the urge to be silly with it. Don't miss the gold. Once you have the moves down, put on some REAL music (the music on the DVDs does admittedly suck) and close your eyes and get down with your bad self. You'll start feeling the magic.

You can make these workouts as hard as you want. If you really grip your muscles and move slowly (it's harder slow, people!) you'll get a workout. Get level 2 if you're worried about it being too easy. This is for every shape, size, and flexibility level (I mean, we don't all get as low in the stretches, but be compassionate with yourself).

And if you are in LA, SF, NY or anywhere else they offer them, go to an intro class. I loooooved mine and you'll definitely get how these moves come together into something alchemical!

(PS- I have only ever been a student, they don't pay me to say nice things hahaha)",1422316800,4,1543,4.476868327402135
8198808,5,B000R4GVIO,I love this video... now I just need a few more hours in the day wihen there are no kids around so I can actually do the workout.,1362700800,3,129,3.642857142857143
8198809,2,B000R4GVIO,The dance routines in this DVD are too slow. My friend and I felt silly doing it and it made us want to go to sleep. Very boring. We both did not feel like we got a work out.,1356912000,,174,3.4871794871794872
8198810,1,B000R4GVIO,"I had seen Sheila Kelley on many television programs over the years. I knew she had created a successful business and was clearly passionate about what she did, so I expected a product quality that was commensurate to her success. Unfortunately, I was very, very wrong in my expectations. This product is so poorly made that I can only urge you to save your money. First of all, the video quality is really poor. It does not look like something that was professionally done but rather shot as a home video. The workout itself feels so terribly outdated. I was really looking forward to it, but it's rather boring and not something you would really want to use as a reference or a work-out video. Save yourself the money!",1326326400,3,720,4.589147286821706
8198811,4,B000R4GVIO,This is a great workout! I first saw Sheila Kelley on Martha Stewart's fitness show and decided to try it. It is great for people at all fitness levels because you can make your own modifications if need be. I love it and I plan to buy the more advanced DVDs as well as a pole! :-),1314921600,3,281,3.9473684210526314
8198812,1,B000R4GVIO,has nothing about pole dancing so it's a little mis leading.  Exotic dancing she does give you some tips.  Level one means what it says.,1287014400,3,136,4.4
8198813,5,B000R4GVIO,"Sheila Kelley has a friendly personality and she is very encouraging.  The exercises are pretty easy to follow, but they are not easy to perfect.  Most of the moves here are circular. They are also painfully slow, which is good so you won't be huffing and puffing, and it makes your muscles work harder.  Your flexibility will increase (over time) and your confidence will also increase on the first day.  You will also feel so sexy and comfortable with yourself, that you might even find yourself walking differently after this workout is over. There is an ""s-factor walk"" and a ""crawl"" section after the hour-long workout, but I haven't done those yet, since my livingroom is not all that big, but I'm sure I will move the furniture around so I can finally do them.
Warning: You will feel it in your abs the next day.",1212105600,36,819,4.589041095890411
