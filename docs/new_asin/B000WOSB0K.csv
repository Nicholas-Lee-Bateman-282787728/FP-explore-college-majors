It did not give the foundation for the war in Vietnam from the beginning for the United States during the 1950's.  It did not point out the reasons the French were originally there colonizing the country, who authorized it, what countries encouraged it, or the 1000-year history of the fight for autonomy by the Vietnam people.

Good footage of some major battles provides insight into what it was like to be there. Anyone interested in a real ""America haters"" viewpoint of the war should check out the ""comments"" left on a post here titled ""The View of a Vietnam Combat Vet"" by sethspeaks ""wa"". There's a running dialogue among the comments between ""Erroll"" (the world's pre-eminent America hater) and myself (Elvin Pelvin, Vietnam Vet). I got involved in this when I read Erroll's comment criticizing ""sethspeaks"" post. Erroll, who claims to be a Vietnam Vet himself (though I seriously doubt it) was attacking Seth (who has suffered greatly from his service in Vietnam) without mercy. So I decided to speak out against Erroll in Seth's defense and this, in turn, shifted Erroll's attention away from Seth and brought the fullness of his wrath down upon me. Not a problem though, I've been dealing with his kind for years, although I will admit that Erroll is, without question, the worst ""America hater"" I've ever encountered. He's so extreme that I'm convinced he's a member of some terrorist group who want to overthrow the American government. Read it for yourself and see who you think the mentally disturbed person is in the verbal exchange, then get back to me on this post and leave a comment of your own.

The true sounds of the war.  What it felt like  to see your best friend in pieces on the ground. I to was a Volenteer, and came back 3 times total, not because I loved it but I was young dumb and single. I really thought I could save a Dad with kids from going over. War is War  I won't go into the details this missed or  was right about it. When I came back from my last tour I was in the Hospital For  over a Year. During the last few month I was able to leave the hospital for afew hours, that I loved , what I hated we were not allowed to wear our uniforms off base.  Seems they were offencive to many of the locals. The things that went on in that country cost me alot , my first heart attack at 29, 3 bouts with cancer, at 61 I can bearly walk, but that is ok I am better off then many. For many many year I hate what the war did to me and others ,  I hated the way We were treated when we came home, I hate the fact that many more died after coming home from everything for cancer to taking their own lives.  For year I could not stand watching how good the troops were treated when they were coming home from other wars, I felt cheat again, I was jealous. Two weeks ago that all changed.  I was in a Fry's store (a supermarket ) It was Vetern's week so Had on a Viet Nam vet  hat and shirt. I was standing looking at something and felt a light tapping on my back.  I turn to find what looked to be a brother and sister  maybe  7 to 8 years old, they looked up at me ( i could see just alittle fear in their eyes ).  The little girl said to me ""Welcome Home  and the Little boy  put out his hand for me to shake and said to me  ""  Thank you for Serving "".  I know it was the parents that told the kids what to do and say. I  thanked them both with a salute and a thank you and spent the rest of my time in the store  with  tears in my eyes.  That meant more to me then all the metals, everything.

8224717,4,B000WOSB0K,I'm giving this 4 stars because the first DVD was excellent but the second disc was just plain stupid. What is with the multiple choice questions? I'm trying to watch a movie not take an exam!! I was extremely disappointed with disc two. After disc one I was excited to watch disc two and it was so irritating I had to shut it off. Why did they add multiple choice questions to a Vietnam documentary ?? I'd love to hear the reasoning behind that.,1469923200,,446,4.321428571428571

8224721,1,B000WOSB0K,"With the History Channel logo I expected a factual documentary....WRONG...This is a product of CBS ""News"" and loaded with anti-war propaganda from the political agenda of CBS.  I only watched a part of this video because I ran out of barf bags.",1437350400,2,244,4.809523809523809
