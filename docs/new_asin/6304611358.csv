7874869,2,6304611358,"When I saw this listing I was hoping that this would be the Three Stooges guest appearance on one of Danny Thomas' Wonderful World Of Burlesque specials from the 1960s.  It is not.  Instead it is two different black and  white tapes which have nothing to do with each other.  The Danny Thomas  stuff is separate from the Stooges stuff, and all of it is public domain  stuff, that shows up over and over again under a myriad of titles, but the  same old stuff.
I am not knocking the actual material.  I enjoy the  Stooges, and Danny Thomas is great.  I am just concerned that so many  people are making money recycling the same material, which is poorly  transferred and for which I know none of the original participants are  sharing in a royalty.  I feel this sort of thing should not be supported.  Buyer Beware!",962755200,8,814,4.442176870748299
