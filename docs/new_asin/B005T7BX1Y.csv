4888362,3,B005T7BX1Y,"i was wondering if anyone knows if the seasons 1,3,4,5,6,7,8 are complete or not because i to have been waiting to purchase all 9 complete seasons i did contact amazon by phone and asked them if they know when or if they are going to release the second 13 episodes of season 2 to make season 2 complete and i was told that a soon s they know they will post it on web site and i also asked them about the last 4( 8 stories) like what someone else mentioned because i saw that the last season 9 says on it the best of so if anyone knows if the other seasons are complete meaning 1,3,4 ,5,6,7,8, the other thing i noticed that all the seasons are priced differently also i thought that they would all be the same price. so if anyone knows if these other season are complete or not i would like t know before i buy them. i also read somewhere that the shout factory might be coming out with thse same seasons so i contacted them to check on this and i haven't heard back yet so i don't know if this is true or not. and i guess that they are just being sold exclusively here on amazon.",1320105600,,1080,4.027906976744186
4888363,1,B005T7BX1Y,I think it is very sad that amazon can't release and can not release the full seasons of 2 and 9. I think if we just don't buy the seasons that have not been put on a full season then they might release them in full sets because we don't want some episodes from seasons packages we want it all. Especially since it is not on TV anymore. So amazon please release the full seasons. Thanks for reading please tell amazon this. Thanks,1318550400,10,430,4.192771084337349

4888369,5,B005T7BX1Y,"I'll admit, I knew of the Rugrats seasons being on DVD for quite sometime now, but I'm glad I waited to get this one until after the entire season was released, as I would have been disappointed had I gotten the final season prior to 5/15/14, when only part of the season had been released. No matter, while this was the final season of Rugrats, it's a great season, and I don't regret it one bit. In this final season, we get the hour long special, Babies in Toyland, where we celebrate Christmas for the first time with Kimi and Dil, we meet Phil and Lil's British relatives in the episode, The Perfect Twins, along with Betty's college roommate and hyper active daughter Alice in the episode, Hurricane Alice, and if you liked seeing Taffy at the end of season 8, and are looking for more fun filled adventures with this really cool babysitter, you get them in season 9! We get everything from going to a video game arcade in Diapies and Dragons, a basketball game in Bug Off, and we even get a scare of our Lives in Who's Taffy when Angelica and Taffy trade places, or they do as far as the Rugrats are concerned. And if you thought planting Dil was bad in season 6, looks like another Dil and dill mix up comes into play in season 9, when the babies go to a fast food restaurant for the first time, only to learn that Taffy doesn't like dill pickles, when they once again, get it all mixed up, and think she doesn't like Dil Pickles. We also get another scare when they're at a baby sale, worried they'll be sold, we meet their snow baby friend, Steve, we learn where Stu and Chaz met for the first time in Fountain of Youth, and to end it all off, we see Kimi turn two in Kimi Takes the Cake.

This season is formatted just like season 2 was, with the theme song before each 22 minute episode, or at the start of the hour long special in the case with Babies in Toyland, and out of all of the seasons, while it's the same length episode wise as seasons 1 and 8, totaling 13 episodes, if you count Babies in Toy Land as 1 episode rather than 2 episodes, but disc wise, it's the shortest season to date, only containing 2 discs. No matter, while it's the final season, don't cry, because you can always go back and watch all of the episodes again and again and again, cuz a baby's gotta do, what a baby's gotta do! So hang on to your diapies babies, for the final season of Rugrats, in season 9, that's so mighty fine!",1438128000,,2422,4.23110151187905

4888374,5,B005T7BX1Y,"The final 14 chunks of episodes of Rugrats are contained in this 2-disc set of dual-layered DVD-R discs (including Babies in Toyland taking up 2 episodes in production order). What's more, they all contain closed-captioning, a modern Nick jingle to start them all off, like the last half of season 2, and with the recent FBI-Homeland Security Warning before each show, or just once for each disc if you choose ""Play All"". Due to SpongeBob's popularity and Klasky Csupo's changing tastes, the original Rugrats series ends here. However, it did continue with the 2 Tales From the Crib movies on DVD in '05 and '06. It's hard to believe that the original series ended in similar ways that it began; a birthday party gone horribly-but-memorably wrong, in this case, Kimi's 2nd birthday in the final episode Kimi Takes The Cake. Other ""'ventures"" that wrapped up the series include a family-filled vacation to Club Fred, Phil and Lil meeting their British cousins Hedley and Smedley, the hour-long Christmas TV movie Babies in Toyland (which runs as a whole hour-long episode without being broken up into 2 parts, and marked the 10th anniversary of the show's original Christmas episode, The Santa Experience; as The Book of Pooh's The Wishing Tree did the same for the 10th anniversary of Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too back in 2001), the babies having a ""rewards"" show, ""saving"" Taffy in an arcade, thinking Dil is really strong from ""baby power"" (powder) when it was really earthquakes that occurred, trying to stop a bee-like mascot and his ""followers"" at Taffy's High School basketball game, discovering the crawl space in Tommy and Dil's house; Kimi being cast in a movie (whose director was voiced by toon legend Dom DeLuise), Phil picking up trash like one of Taffy's crushes (voiced by Amanda Show co-star Drake Bell), Pepper getting her name after an expensive visit from a whacko dog expert; Phil, Lil, Tommy and their parents trying to avoid Hurricane Alice (or in the babies' case, a hyperactive relative of Phil and Lil's named Alice, at the same time); Angelica, Susie, Stu, and Chas in a pet show, the babies worrying about Taffy not liking ""dill pickles"" in a burger restaurant, worrying about being sold in a ""baby sale"" and creating Steve the snowbaby, Tommy tries to find an ""A"" for his mom to keep her from crying; a campout at Stu, Drew, and Chas' favorite campground, and several others, like the series finale of Kimi's birthday going out of whack (in this case, it's not trying out dog food and acting like dogs, but Stu getting the wrong castle for Kimi's party, yet it went off great in the end like Tommy's 1st birthday did). Other guest stars in season 9 include Digimon actresses Mona Marshall (one of the boys from Baby Sale) and Melissa Fahn (one of the carolers from Babies in Toyland), and of course Andrea Martin who played Aunt Miriam for the last time (in this series anyway). No glitches to be spoken of with my season 9 set, and thank ""Bob"" for that. All our fighting to make Amazon and Nick put out the entire 2nd and 9th seasons of Rugrats has finally worked! Who knows if they'll release All Grown Up in season sets soon, especially if you've really wanted to go that far in the Rugrats legacy? Complete your Rugrats DVD season sets collection with the whole 9th season set today! There's also the movie trilogy and 2 Tales From The Crib movies if you wish to add them to your collection too! What a swan song for such a beloved Nicktoon series, on top of their sharing a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame! It's amazing SpongeBob hasn't gone that far yet, even with his popularity still bypassing that of Rugrats! With this very DVD set, I've now seen every episode of the original Rugrats series! You won't regret how the final season of Rugrats goes, if you're a long-running fan of it!",1408492800,11,3829,4.699404761904762

I mean yeah now they are playing it on the 90's are all that but not every episode. The creator's want to bring it back for one more season but that hasn't happened so amazon needs to release the full seasons of 2 and 9 i mean seriously couldn't they have made season 2 volume 1 and 2 for half.
and judt added the two other episodes to season nine who's with me huh",1371945600,2,561,4.017857142857143
4888384,1,B005T7BX1Y,"Okay, we have had to wait a long time for these season sets to be released. Not only has the quality not been updated, there are a few errors throughout the season set where the discs cut out -sound, static, etc. (And I believe it is the discs because it has happened on other DVRed Nickelodeon shows and with replacement copies.) Now we don't even get the whole set with season nine. Amazon is a big company. So is Nickelodeon. There is no reason why this shouldn't be a complete set. Not only that, but ""best of"" is subject to individual opinion. There may be some people who think the episodes missing from the set are the best ones of the season. I will not be purchasing an incomplete set.
The second half of season two is also missing. One of these missing episodes is ""The Box,"" my favorite Rugrats episode.
There is also some unaired episode that I have never seen before called ""Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing"" that would have fell into season one. Logically, that should have been a special feature for season one.
Amazon, please release all the episodes and consider updating the quality.",1320105600,19,1108,4.545

I know they do the re-runs and 90's blocks but it was truly a great time to watch these. I am nearly done collecting the original series - need seasons: 1,3,4,5 & 8. No extras or bonus material - still good to have the episodes on there. The end of an era - the All grown-up series was adorable but this was the end. :(",1489708800,,475,4.0638297872340425

Before SpongeBob SquarePants and The Fairly OddParents succeeded with more episodes, Rugrats was the only Nicktoon to end with 9 seasons. I believe every other Nickelodeon show (not just Nicktoons) ended before 9 seasons. I also love how the last episode relates to the topic of the very first episode of the series. The first episode deals with Tommy's birthday, the last episode deals with Kimi's birthday. I'm glad to say I now own every season of Rugrats!",1486771200,,529,4.888888888888889
