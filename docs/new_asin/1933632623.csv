203366,5,1933632623,"Spend an hour of your day to watch this jaw-dropping beautiful movie. This film will move you, will feed your soul and stay with you long after you finished watching. Very little dialogue but a total joy for the senses.",1290038400,5,219,4.5
203367,5,1933632623,"Simply amazing and stunning. Beautiful and peaceful...
(I wonder, if they are going to republish this unique work in HD format?)",1280361600,2,128,5.142857142857143
203368,5,1933632623,"This was the most awe inspiring work of art I've seen in a long time, whenever I want to have a moment of peace, I put this on and melt into my environment...makes me want to dance with elephants...a must see!!!

Can't wait to read the book!",1272326400,2,241,4.127659574468085
203369,5,1933632623,"I find the greatest way to relax, open my heart, experience a spiritual transformation, imagine the unimaginable and drift into new dreams is to watch this movie.  Any part of it.  The whole thing or just a few moments. Such a phenomenal exploration, gorgeous and minimal writing and powerful images that float in my mind's eye for hours and even days afterwards. This DVD is called a 'product', I find it to be an extraordinary encounter.",1270512000,,439,4.7631578947368425
203370,5,1933632623,"Listen to David Sylvan's ""Orpheus"" while watching the first underwater scene at the beginning of the film.",1265068800,5,106,5.294117647058823
203371,5,1933632623,The Film is one of the best arts that I have been seeing.  The cameras capture unbelieveble peaceful images between the wild animals and human being. Amazing! It touchs the soul!! It could help the education of kids.,1264809600,4,216,4.684210526315789
203372,5,1933632623,"This is the most beautiful DVD I have seen.  The cinematography is exceptional and the images are moving, to say the least.

Captured is the most symbiotic elegance between humans and nature that seems impossible to obtain.  This is an exquisite piece of art!",1260921600,15,259,4.840909090909091
203373,5,1933632623,"You've had a rough day--or maybe a series of rough days, right? Or maybe you feel really down about everything. Your head is spinning. There's too much noise. Even your living room seems too loud. What can you do? You can insert this DVD into the player (as long as the DVD player works properly), kick back, let out a sigh, and then watch this movie. It's about as relaxing as anything you'll find. But more than this, be prepared to be drawn into beautiful episodes of filmmaking. And just draw it all in, leave behind the ceaseless distractions and get back to the original source of sanity.

Okay, maybe I'm overstating that a bit. And I'm sure that this DVD would drive some people to madness because it is so slow and unassuming, and maybe too much sepia. But the good reasons why people ought to like this DVD have little to do with action and special effects, crowds and sepia. They have to do with discovery, with finding ourselves in despair in the cool, roomy world of cell phones and instant messaging, where someone is always asking, ""Where is it?"" ""Is it ready yet?"" ""How soon can I have it?"" Here, elephants float in lakes in languorous peace peddling Earth's only answer. Over and again, just one word: ""Hush.""

Now this is how I spell relief.",1256428800,40,1259,4.517543859649122

203375,5,1933632623,Same film as the ones that play on the resorts in Mexico. It is a great piece of art and gets my wife in the mood. Highly recommend it if you have an open mind.,1454371200,,160,3.6

203379,4,1933632623,"I purchased this because they play it in our rooms at Caribbean resorts. Very relaxing and ""Zen"". Reminds me of vacation. Although Amazon had the best price, I think generally this DVD is overpriced. Realistically it should cost around $20.",1428364800,,240,5.025
203380,5,1933632623,"Watching this video was an  absorbing and enchanting experience.

203387,5,1933632623,"I first saw this video several years ago at a boutique hotel where they played this in a loop on their channel for the hotel. It was hypnotic, we loved it and watched it whenever we were in our room. I always wished I could find out where to buy the video but it took a few more years and a trip to Zoetry in Riviera Maya this winter to finally pin down the name of the movie. They didn't have it at the gift shop there but told us how popular it was and that they had a hard time getting it. When we got back to the states I found it on Amazon and bought it right away. It's great for relaxation!",1394064000,,597,3.8225806451612905
203388,5,1933632623,"This was on the TV at  Secrets the vine when we walked in after 12 hours of planes, airports and taxi's. It was memorizing and it was better then any stiff drink relaxing us as we relaxed on the bed. ( less of a headache too)  if you have not been lucky enough to see it yet,check it out on YouTube and then come back and order. There are no words to explain the beauty of the film, swimming elephants, wild African cats sitting and acting as a backrest and a magnificent large bird flying through a open hall way. Your brain just quiets down, you focus on the beauty and movement on the tv. This is all brown, shades of brown that is very resting on the eyes. I could not wait to order it, and it arrived the day after we got back. If you are in need of calm, order it. It is also amazing to listen to while doing bills and other mindless things. We bought a copy for a new mom, for those wild early days of being a mom. What more can I say, it's better then any music I have heard.",1390521600,,983,3.95959595959596
203389,5,1933632623,"This is a mesmerizing experience!  I first saw the film in the Nomadic Museum when it came to Los Angeles, which was a an encompassing, meditative exhibit that remains powerful in memory... this magical DVD collects (IIRC) various bits of footage that were scattered through the museum.  It is dreamlike, and takes you swimming with elephants and whales, sitting in an unmoving boat as the world rolls past you, lying down with lions (well, cheetahs, at least)... a surreal journey that calms and refreshes.  Don't miss it!",1384300800,,523,4.988505747126437
203390,5,1933632623,We were in Mexico and saw this playing on the TV and we knew we had to have it.  Visually stunning cinematography.,1381968000,,114,4.181818181818182
203391,5,1933632623,This is artistry meets nature at another level... I do know the animals were sedated however the methods I have researched were with sound herbal and un harmful therapies... impressive and out of this world.,1380067200,,207,4.942857142857143
203392,5,1933632623,I would be interested in other Gregory Colbert's works or series.  What else is available?  As an artist and dancer myself I found Ashes and snow film not only spiritual but also profound.  Actually I was surprised to find out is was available.  A film I will watch over aand over and still see new revelations.  Thank you.,1370649600,,323,4.5

as soon as I got home I ordered 3 copies two were gifts one for me!

Divinely inspired piece of work",1358640000,,135,3.7857142857142856
203396,3,1933632623,pretty disappointed that the film didn't feature the lions or the baboons and what i bought it for which was the woman with the orangutan - feel a bit ripped off because the price is so stiff.,1357862400,2,192,4.216216216216216
203397,4,1933632623,"I bought it for a gift, hoping it is the same one she watched in the Dominican Republic, Dreams Tropical & Spa.  So not sure until I give it to her.  She fell in love with it, and asked for it for a Christmas. Just hope it is the same show.",1353628800,,240,3.6862745098039214
203398,5,1933632623,"The Ashes and Snow DVD I purchased far exceeded my expectations.  It's a great video

203400,4,1933632623,"There is nothing wrong with the product, but I was a bit dissapionted at the movie itself. It was so much better without any sounds and voices added (but that is of course just my personal opinion.) Also the were no options to choose any subtitles. Finally I would ask - Why does this movie cost so much more than what a DVD usually costs? It was not SO special. Could it perhaps only be because of the cover which was not in plastic but in some kind of hard paper? I don't know.",1339545600,,479,4.1063829787234045
203401,5,1933632623,Others have described it in appropriately flowing terms; I can only add that to me it is 24 photographic masterpieces per second for 3600 seconds.,1328313600,,146,4.88
203402,3,1933632623,"I was really expecting something extraordinary when I bought this, based on prior reviews. Unfortunately, while it is a good bit of performance art, it's just not something I'll be watching again and again.

The imagery is all scripted performance art, and it's all in sepia tones, which gets very tiring very quickly. While there are lots of animals in the credits, it's mostly elephants and one very long sequence with lions. The lion sequence is extremely repetitive, showing basically the same few poses over and over. If you're expecting natural interaction between humans and animals, you'll be disappointed, because this isn't that, it's more like carefully performed and exhaustively scripted dance.

The music is often also repetitive to the point of boredom. I love most ""shoegazer"" music, but some of the sequences are simply a few chords repeated endlessly - the worst of shoegazing, I'm afraid.

Both the music and images could have been relaxing and/or inspiring without being so overwhelmingly repetitive.

And lastly, there is no parent's advisory on the product page, but there should be, as it does contain some partial nudity that may not be suitable for younger viewers.",1325376000,4,1190,5.150259067357513
203403,5,1933632623,"My husband and I were on a vacation in Mexico and there was a TV channel that played this video. It is the most mesmerizing, relaxing piece of film I've ever seen and we ""tracked it down"" when we came home to the states. We had no idea on the name of it but thanks to my husband we figured it out. It's great to have on in the background after a stressful day, or put it on in the morning and stay zenned out. My husband who is type A, always working, never sitting still, wanted it and puts it in after a long 14+ hour day of work to wind down. A must buy!",1324252800,10,557,3.810344827586207
