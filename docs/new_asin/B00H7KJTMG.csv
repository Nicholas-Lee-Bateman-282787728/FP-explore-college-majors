6137022,3,B00H7KJTMG,"I will begin with what is good about this movie. The visual aspect is stunning. David Krentz (the dinosaur designer and animator) has done an amazing job and it shows with active, quickly moving and avian looking dinosaurs.
Sadly, the beautiful work of David Krentz was sabotaged by the nonsensical dialogue. Bathroom based humour, in an attempt to appeal to those too young to handle the more intense predation scenes, is only one of the schizophrenic aspects of this train wreck of a film (remember we are talking about the audio only in this critical part of my review). The dialogue shifts between toddler type jokes, to teenage banter, then to semi serious moral issues, then quickly back to the tail end of the digestive system, in case the audience did not already have enough reference to defecation and the rectum. Even the storyline is derailed by the dialogue.
I really hope that the producers of this film read the reviews from most every columnist, which echo my own commentary. For the DVD release PLEASE offer an alternate audio track, which will harken back to the original Walking With Dinosaurs, the beloved and groundbreaking series. Narration that does not attempt to run away, competing with the visuals, but offers insightful and thoughtful information, just as the brilliant work of Kenneth Branaugh in the original series, would rescue and redeem this film.
If it was possible to have and experience which does not insult the viewer, but instead offers to enlighten, educate and delight, would surely win over those put off by the grave errors this film committed in its audio choices.",1387843200,8,1609,4.940959409594096
6137023,2,B00H7KJTMG,"A FILM ONLY FOR CHILDREN, borrowing heavily from Disney's ""Dinosaur"", ""Land before time"" and ""March of the dinosaurs"",
Even if the title is the same this children oriented film has virtually NOTHING IN COMMON with the ground-breaking 1999 BBC series ""Walking with dinosaurs"", as far from being a document, this is in fact a film for kids, in which dinosaurs and birds are intelligent and can talk. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

PARENTAL WARNING! Some scenes in this film can and will TERRIFY youngest children, especially in 3D (both in theaters and at home) - the scariest scenes include very large predators (there are numerous Gorgosaurus in this film) jumping towards the public and seemingly trying to gnaw at the spectators with their mouths (filled with scary looking teeth) wide open and violently snapping. I would rather avoid showing it to children below at least age of 7. There is also a pretty scary and impressive scene of HUGE RAGING FOREST FIRE and some terrified and crying for help pachyrhinosaurus DROWNING in a freezing lake...

First, let's stress it again, in this film, like in Disney's 2000 film ""Dinosaur"" and like in ""Land before time"" series some dinosaurs (and one bird) are fully intelligent and can talk. Like in Disney's film, we begin with the main hero, a young pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi, being just a hatchling - and the runt of the litter... Patchi, his big bully of brother named Scowler and his other siblings speak, A LOT - on another hand for some reason their parents don't talk. At all.

Patchi is very badly treated by his brothers and sisters, but he befriends a prehistoric bird named Alex, who plays with him and talks. A LOT! Later Patchi will meet Juniper, a little female pachyrhinosaurus of same age as him, who will become the love of his life. As you can see, the main dinosaurs here are fully ""humanized"" as in ""Dinosaur"" and ""Land before time"" and they will continue this way during all the film, even when they are fully grown up. On another hand other dinosaurs and other creatures (including some pesky cretaceous mammals) don't speak.

This film borrows A LOT from Disney's ""Dinosaur"", with Patchi being in many ways similar to Aladar, Juniper being a carbon copy of Neera and especially the character of Scowler being an almost identical twin to Kron. To continue the similarities, bird Alex simply replaces the lemurs and the pack of gorgosaurus takes the place of the pair of carnotaurus. The species are different, but the characters are not... Sorry, SPOILER here: even the final fight was copied from the final confrontation in ""Dinosaur""...

On another hand, this film is also in large part inspired by a good document called ""March of dinosaurs"" (see my review of this one) made in 2011 and narrated by Stephen Fry. Both this film and ""The March of the dinosaurs"" are centered around the yearly migration of a huge herd of dinosaurs living in Cretaceous in North America to the south in autumn and then back to the north in spring. In ""The March of the dinosaurs"" the main character was a young edmontosaurus called Scar because it was hurt in childhood and the pachyrhinosaurus are secondary characters - here the main hero is a pachyrhinosaurus called Patchi, who was hurt and scarred in childhood and the edmontosaurus are secondary characters... In both films we also meet some gorgosaurus, troodons and scavenging pterosaurs. I personally found ""The March of dinosaurs"", which is a document trying to stick very closely to science, much much better and at least as interesting for older children and teenagers.

My 12 years old daughter - who likes dinosaurs, monsters, aliens, mutants and anything else that goes nicely with popcorn - enjoyed this film, which contains some pretty humouristic moments, provided mostly by wise-cracking bird Alex. Me on another hand, I was only partially satisfied, for following reasons:

- the images are certainly gorgeous but ultimately not really better than in the ""Walking with dinosaurs"" which was after all made 14 years ago

- the 3D is useful in a couple of sequences (I was really tempted to try to pat a quetzalcoatlus pterosaur on its beak...) but not really so much needed during the rest of the film.

- the number of dinosaurs species shown is really rather limited for such a long film - only four species are really shown for any duration (pachyrhinosaurus, gorgosaurus, troodon, edmontosaurus) together with the quetzalcoatlus pterosaurs one bird and a couple of little mammals. There is also one ankylosaurus and a couple of chirostenotes, parksosaurus and hesperonychus all appearing like for 10 seconds... and that is all.

- the film doesn't know really where to go. Most of time it is a film purely for children, but then by moments it tries to be also a document - and as a result it is not entirely succesful in either category.

Bottom line, this is a watchable dinosaur film FOR OLDER CHILDREN and YOUNG TEENAGERS, but nothing else. For adults and older teenagers I really advise to skip it and watch/re-watch other great British dinosaur productions like the original ""Walking with dinosaurs"" series and ""The March of dinosaurs"" or the excellent American series ""Dinosaur revolution"".",1387411200,2,5244,4.920814479638009

Andrews Blu-ray Review: WALKING WITH DINOSAURS 3D  THE MOVIE [2013] was originally a BBC TV series that aired as a documentary series in 1999 before it was turned into this spectacular Real 3D film. The gigantic voice talents of Justin Long and John Leguizamo take you on a thrilling prehistoric journey the whole family will enjoy! In a time when dinosaurs rule the Earth, the smallest of the pack and a playful Pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi embarks on the biggest adventure of his life. As he tries to find his place in a spectacular world filled with fun-loving friends and a few dangerous foes, Patchi will discover the courage he needs to become the leader of the herd...and a hero for the ages.

What are truly extraordinary about this Real 3D film are its stunning visual achievements. Without a question there have been amazing films made about dinosaurs, and every interpretation of what these long-gone creatures looked like is more impressive and interesting, but since it was based on a documentary WALKING WITH DINOSAURS this has to be one of the most accurate and up-to-date visualizations of what dinosaurs truly looked, and performed like. Don't worry though, it isn't all just science, the IMAX 3D film features a loveable story as we follow best friends Patchi, Scowler and Juniper, three Pachyrhinosaurus's as they grow from babies to adults, struggling all the while to find their footing in the world. Especially Patchi, who learns how to become leader and takes control of the herd of dinosaurs.

Filmed with the latest in cutting edge Real 3D technology, WALKING WITH DINOSAURS 3D  THE MOVIE taps into the masterminds behind visual hits like the 3D film AVATAR and using James Cameron Pace Fusion Real 3D technology to fully immerse viewers while recruiting animation house, Animal Logic, to bringing the digital dinosaur magic to life by creating photo realistic dinosaurs based on paleontological research from world experts retained by the BBC organisation.

Blu-ray Image Quality  20th Century Fox brings us this Dinosaur Real 3D film in stunning 1080p image presentation, which is enhanced with a very nice 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Sold under a banner that states it is a 3D Movie, and this Dinosaur tale will suffice when viewers put on their 3D glasses, they will experience absolutely brilliant images. Direction is in full consideration of the format, snapping maws leaping from the front of the frame towards Real 3D enthusiasts. Images are notably bright with considerable contrast, and when not, moonlight is valuable. 3D action pushes flame embers, flawless underwater views, floating butterfly arrays, and forested depth with natural beauty. Skyward flying scenes recreate a sense of height and rotund creatures establish a depth propelled girth. WALKING WITH DINOSAURS 3D  THE MOVIE is an intelligent and careful display of the technical features and what is striking about the Real 3D images you view is that you experience a grand 3 dimensional feel not just in distance, and especially regarding objects and beings themselves.  With such a highly detailed CGI dominated picture you cannot help but get a grand sense of scale and depth. The black levels are very nice and varied. Colours give us a much more natural and a real approach, especially in the New Zealand and Alaskan locations, that is totally natural beauty with lots of Real 3D action, especially with the flaming embers, flawless underwater views, floating butterfly arrays, and forest depth of field to give you totally natural beauty. Skyward flying scenes recreate a sense of height and especially the rotund large and plump creatures establish the depth of their girth. WALKING WITH DINOSAURS 3D  THE MOVIE is an intelligent and brilliant display of brilliant technical detail at its very best. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox brings us this Dinosaur Real 3D film with an amazing 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience, especially with the stomping prehistoric herds will invigorate your subwoofer, adding substantial weight to the happenings with all the herd of dinosaurs. This is a very good and excellent audio, especially when we hear the special sound effects that are 100% clean, crisp and quite well defined. All of your speakers are mostly used for ambient sounds and the film music score. The highlight though is during the devastating forest fire, where it creates a true sense of a very dangerous environment. Dialogue is clean and crisp, but the problems here lie in the source, as everything sounds like a voice over narration instead of natural dialogue in the sense of its environment.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: WALKING WITH DINOSAURS: Ultimate Dino Guide [2014] [1080p] [2.40:1] This special feature gives an introduction of a very in-depth interactive feature where you can learn very specific qualities about the different dinosaurs featured in the film. This is a very educational feature, and not necessarily aimed at children either. It allows you to select different creatures to learn about them as well as where they lived on the Earth and other information and they are as follows: PACHYRHINOSAURUS [4:04]; ALEXORNIS [2:19]; GORGOSAURUS [1:58]; HESPERONYCHUS [1:19]; ANKYLOSAURUS [1:10]; CHIROSTENOTES [1:31]; TROODON [2:05]; PARKSOSAURUS [1:09]; EDMONTOSAURUS [1:56]; PTEROSAURS [1:40] and ALPHADON [1:24]. Narrated by Finneas O'Connell. Unfortunately, you get the Dutch and French subtitles appear and you cannot delete them.

Special Feature: PREHISTORIC VERSION: Discover and view the film with only the sounds of the Dinosaurs, composed music, pop songs and sound effects without the silly prehistoric animal voices.

Blu-ray Sneak Peaks: AFRICAN SAFARI 3D [2013] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:30] [Dutch Voice], BELLE EN HET BEEST [2014] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:30] and OORLOGSGEHEIMEN [2014] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:30]

BONUS: With this Dutch Blu-ray Release you get a stunning very colourful embossed slip cover, which is far superior in design to the United Kingdom and USA Blu-ray cover releases.

Finally, WALKING WITH DINOSAURS 3D  THE MOVIE gives you a fantastic Real 3D image presentation. The Real 3D release of this film actually includes a feature where you can turn the dinosaur voices off if you do not feel they are realistic enough. The Real 3D film is intended for young children and thus the bonus materials provide plenty of educational learning experiences for them to interact with. Although, I think this film will quickly outgrow young children and move on to better things, but on the other hand some children might like to have repeat viewings when they feel in the mood for a Dinosaur fix. While this Real 3D film, 20th Century Fox was probably hoping it would become a modern classic dinosaur film, but sadly this never happened, but for me personally I really enjoyed the film, and especially viewing it in the stunning Real 3D process and I know I will enjoy watching with repeat viewings. Highly Recommended!

The overdubbed voices are a bit off putting because the dinosaurs mouths don't move but let's not act like this is the first movie to do so and the kids don't seem to mind. It's not all fart jokes either, there are some lessons about friendship/family in there so it won't rot your kids brains. The dinosaur intoductions aren't that bad either.  If your kid actually likes dinosaurs (since you're reading this, then they probably do) they won't find it distracting and instead actually learn something.  Imagine that. The CGI and animation is fantastic so the kids usually stay glued (if that's a good thing) to the movie.

All in all, it's a good movie for dino loving kids, which is who it was made for, not the picky adult internet critics.",1459468800,,802,4.626760563380282

6137164,1,B00H7KJTMG,"Just finished watching ""Walking With Dinosaurs - The Movie"" released by 20th Century Fox.
""Walking With Dinosaurs,"" from all the accounts I've read, was an innovative stage show that brought dinosaurs rather brilliantly to life on stage to the delight and enchantment of stage audiences everywhere.
Pity the movie version forgot what made the wonder and magic of ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" such a delight to the imagination, and decided to flush the tried and true wonderment of the fans of the stage show down the proverbial toilet for a story that most viewers. like myself, will be left wondering WTF were the producers of thinking during the production phase of this movie.
First, let's be realistic.  No matter how vividly dinosaurs are brought back to life in CGI animation, we're still only making guesses on their behaviors based on the fossil record and from what we can currently correlate in wild animals.
For ""Walking With Dinosaurs,"" reality was tossed out for a fantasy motiff of a bright, but runt-of-the-litter pachyrhinosaurs - given the cute nick-name of ""Patchi,"" to figure out not only how to save the herd from it's stupid pack leader - his older brother - but also a rather bad side story about a bird relating Patchi's life story to a bored teenage boy in order to help him disconnect from the Internet and rediscover his love of dinosaurs with no outside peer pressure decrying him as a DORK.
""Walking With Dinosaurs"" could have been a masterpiece of a lost world recreated.  Instead, ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" is a hackneyed a weakling boy dinosaur meets girl dinosaur and managers to get her by going against the inborn natural social strata of the herd.  Patchi doesn't like to fight, nor does he become herd leader by besting his brother in a match of might.
NOT RECOMMENDED!
Dinosaur enthusiasts should avoid this KER-STINKER at all costs.

6137202,1,B00H7KJTMG,"I was incredibly disappointed!!!

When I heard that 'Walking With Dinosaurs' was going to be made into a movie, I had flashes back to the program of the same name that I had watched when I was younger, and was very excited...until I read that the dinosaurs were going to talk, and that excitement immediately died. While the movie looked amazing and beautiful, I watched clips from the movie & listened to the poorly dubbed and awful dialogue, and was just all around disgusted (the Dinosaurs' lips didn't even move, so why did they bother??) There was just no way I could justify even buying a ticket to go see such a travesty, and was not surprised that this was a box office bomb (though I feel pity for all who were involved with the movie before the studio heads poor decision).

Then, I heard that there would be a supposed ""Cretaceous Cut"" of the film that eliminated all the useless, juvenile dialogue. Again I was excited...and then once again disheartened, when I found out that this special Cut would only be available on the 3D version when released. I happened to come across a few people online, however, who said that you don't need a 3D Blu-ray player to watch 3D movies, so I thought I would go ahead and give it a try...once again, more disappointment! This was a complete waste of money, as those people had no idea what they were talking about! I ended up just selling the movie for way less that what I spent, but was not sad to see it go.

This is just a prime example that the management of major motion picture studios (this is not the first Dinosaur themed movie to suffer from a similar decision) have no idea how to make good movies anymore. They really need to take a clue from Universal Studios and 'Jurassic World' that Dinosaurs are not just for kids. There are plenty of older generations, who would love to see realistic, non-juvenile Dinosaur movies, and there seems to be an extreme lack of them. So movie studios, get with the program!!!",1438473600,,1973,4.5210084033613445

what more can I say that hasn't been said all ready?
This movie is horrible.
Really very awful.
While the naming and explanation is fine the dramatization is the worst. Maudlin and melodramatic. The humor is beneath childish.

There are movies with voiced dinosaurs, even cartoons, which are not so awful as this is. I have seen probably most of them.

Not only is the voice acting poor but the script is nonsensical. The CGI is okay but very dated when compared to the infinity superior Walking With Dinosaur series and that was made in 2003. SERIOUSLY, if you are looking to pick a dinosaur movie for children the buy Dinosaur Island. While it is short it is superior in most every way to this drek.

The DVD edition contains only the theatrical release. The Deluxe Blue-ray contains both the theatrical and a Cretaceous Cut. The Cretaceous Cut has no dialogue but is otherwise the same film.",1433376000,3,945,4.715151515151515

The dialog also helped some of the scary parts not be so scary for her. I like that the animals make the roars and noises right along with the dailog, it's like an audio closed captioning, but it's for the dino language impaired.

Visions of boardroom executives kept running through my mind: ""There's no story! Nobody in their right mind will like this movie without a star! My kids want to act, put them in the movie during a fun and heartwarming intro!"" Why would they choose take a triceratops-sized poop on this already-finished movie? Is it some sort of a conspiracy?

These movies are essentially identical except that they focus on different dinosaur types as the leads with the Korean movie featuring a Tyrannosaur type carnivore and WWD a harmless frilled herbivore.  Both dinos have to show plenty of heart to survive but, honestly, the Korean feature is more interesting (dont worry, you can listen to it in English).  WWD is hampered by far too many anachronistic sayings and tries to feel contemporary and hip to a rounded down juvenile audience.  And thats too bad because dinosaurs are quite the fascinating beasties.  The BBC series of the original title did a far better job in exposing us to what a dinos life might have been like and without all of the awful I must overcome this and that tropes.  But we cant be too harsh on this movie because it is aimed squarely at kids and youngsters might not be overly thrilled with this movie but they should also get through it without a yawn on first viewing.

as a adult this movie is pretty lame..its fun seeing the dinosaurs but the voice overs are so stupid..but as a sick 5 1/2 year old this movie is pretty entertaining...she watched the whole movie and was really into it she even went and brought out her dinosaurs(and dragon) toys to play along with...

6137345,4,B00H7KJTMG,This movie has problems big time but it's still enjoyable the voice acting is pretty good the action is cool the story is really mostly simple the dinosaurs look cool but they don't look as good as Jurassic park dinosaurs the humans they really pointless you don't really learn anything about them other than is the father digs up dinosaur bones and he has two kids that also dig up bones but that's it though the voice acting didn't always match the emotions being shown and a ignoring thing Is their are 8 characters three of them don't stay long but out of 8 characters only 4 had a voice acters and its like they was using their minds to talk to each other they didn't open their mouths to talk and I can see that this movie is a bit of a slap in the face to fans of dinosaurs cuz of how they make the dinosaurs be funny but that's the movies stronge point is being funny so if your looking for some good laughs that's if you don't hate how some of the dinosaurs act then you should give it a watch,1412294400,,1002,4.143589743589744

6137353,3,B00H7KJTMG,"This should have been five stars, but, as I'm sure you've already read in the other reviews, the STUPID DECISION TO ADD DIALOGUE RUINS IT!

Pros:  The visuals are beyond excellent.  Quite believable, even in HD on a big TV.  They put a whole lot of money into the visual creation of this, and you can see every dollar.
The research was pretty good.  Unlike Disney's ""Dinosaur"" (which had pretty decent visuals, except for ALL THE LEADING CHARACTERS), they made an effort to get only dinos that were in the same place at the same time.  So we don't see Iguanodons mixed with Styracosaurs mixed with Carnotaurs mixed with Velociraptors mixed with Brachiosaurs mixed with advanced primates mixed with a big rock that falls from the sky, yet turns out NOT to be the K/T bolide.  Purists can point out that the Alaskan mountains (right place) didn't exist in that form in the Cretaceous (wrong time), or that ceratopsians tended not to herd with hadrosaurs due to different environmental preferences, but I'll give it a B+ for research.

CONS:  The talking.  The stupid jokes.  The needless modern ""story"" bracketing the reason we're watching it.  The totally predictable ""underdog becomes leader of the herd"" storyline (like we haven't seen THAT before!).  The besmirching of the WWD name.  And, of course, the talking dinosaurs.
Did I mention the talking dinos?  The producers needs to realize that, despite all the grannies who write that their 4-year-old grandkid loves his dinosaur show, there really is a sophisiticated audience hungry for good dino footage.  The success of the original WWD should be proof enough.  It didn't pander to five-year-olds.  Neither did Planet Dinosaur.  Neither should this.
In fact, many of the dino-maniac kiddies will find this insulting.  This isn't a Saturday morning cartoon.  They're sophisticated enough to enjoy the real thing.
So - IF THEY'D LEFT OUT THE INSIPID DIALOGUE - I'd just say, make it a lot longer.  Because, visually, it's a feast.

Five stars for visual, because it's brilliant.  One star for the dialogue, because Amazon won't let me give zero.  So it's a strong three.",1410825600,,2124,4.949008498583569

6137384,4,B00H7KJTMG,"For as long as I can remember, I've loved dinosaurs.  I think my first real exposure to dinosaurs through film/animation was the Rite of Spring segment of Disney's Fantasia, which got me hooked on the subject from an early age.  And ever since then, I've CRAVED a feature-length dinosaur film that had absolutely no human characters, no talking dinosaurs, and no documentarian voice-over to muddle a truly immersive experience.  Indeed, for a long time, filmmakers have dreamed of creating such a spectacle: ""The Land Before Time"" and Disney's ""Dinosaur"" both began as attempts to bring a voice-free dinosaur film to the big screen, but both caved to studio pressure to add dialog, presumably to keep the kids in the audience engaged.  It always seemed like a rather bone-headed move to me.

""Walking with Dinosaurs: The Movie"" began as the latest attempt to realize this seemingly unattainable dream, and also failed to see it through to the big screen.  And it failed worse than the aforementioned films, as the dialog was added at the last possible minute, and no attempt was made to give the dialog with any sort of drama or emotional sincerity, or to even re-animate the dinosaurs themselves so that they synched with the chatter.  It's just the voice-acting comedians running their mouths for 99% of the film, as if they have a deathly fear of silence.  It robs the film of any emotional impact and the rapid-fire jokes ALL fail miserably.  When I rented it, I couldn't believe how savagely the presence of voice overs tore the film the shreds.

Thankfully, the original vision has survived in some form, and is largely intact.  It still has some flaws left over from the theatrical version of the film in the form of its gimmicky editing choices - the rewinding moment when the young Patchi and his friends tumble into the river, and a freeze-frame of the gorgosaurus that repeatedly focuses on his tiny arms (the bird character was heckling them in the theatrical cut).  Still, on the whole it's a FAR superior film.  It's known as the Cretaceous Cut, and is found only on the 3D blu-ray/DVD set.

I'd heard of it before, and how it was supposedly the film I'd always wanted, so when I saw it on a store shelf for a significantly reduced price, I decided to take the chance and buy it.  I'm happy to report that if you DON'T have a 3D blu-ray player or a 3D-capable TV, it will still play perfectly in 2D format with a normal blu-ray player/PS3/PS4.  Just remember, you'll have to look for it under the extra features menu to find it.

I can't stress enough how AMAZING the Cretaceous Cut is compared to the theatrical.  It's the difference between diamond and coal.  Free from the burden of the comedians' voice acting, the film's visuals and sound design can really sink in, and now the emotional current of the narrative can run strong and unimpeded.  It's a genuinely heartwarming and thrilling adventure, backed by striking visuals and a beautiful score.  You can marvel at the scale and the eye-popping colors of this world, feel the power of the dinosaurs' earth-shaking footsteps and deafening roars, and hear the tenderness in their coos and squawks.  Even the pop songs (most of them) actually kinda work for the movie in their own strange way now that the awful voice-overs are done away with.  The film is so much more powerful when it isn't buried beneath a lazy script... that is, if the actors were even given a script to work with.

If you're a dinosaur lover with a blu-ray player and you want to see this film, don't even waste money by renting the theatrical version (the only one I could find at Redbox, unfortunately). Just go ahead and get the 3D set for the Cretaceous Cut.  I guarantee you won't regret it.",1407369600,,3738,4.696319018404908

To be honest I couldn't tell if it was a comedy or an action adventure. There was waaay too much humor, like OVERKILL and the way the dinosaurs spoke you could never tell who was really talking. Plus how can anyone really decide if this is a kids movie or an adult movie?

It's lack of realistic dinosaur violence tells us its a kids film, but then at the beginning we see the main character's armor bleed rapidly and get bit, up close. So what is this garbage?! It's an insult to dino lovers, that's what! This is trash!

Poor voice acting, bad graphics compared to Jurassic park and even Disney's Dinosaur and lack of plot. The ending is very anti climatic and really fails to keep your interest. The little kids voices introducing the dinosaur's names randomly was ANNOYING.

And the bird's narration got annoying over time as well. The trailer made it look alot more epic than it actually is. Don't let the trailer fool you. Because though mere 2 minutes are the only cool scenes in the whole film. SAVE your money, do NOT buy this movie!",1407024000,,1177,4.465116279069767

My little boy used to love dinosaurs but was replaced with Lego mini figures instead. I think this help rekindle his like for dinosaurs again.

Watching the Bluray version is AWESOME. the clarity and texture on the dinosaurs is wonderful. This kept my son entertained.

6137473,5,B00H7KJTMG,In the day and age when crap is praised and something decent is lothed this was actually good.  For once we have a movie that tells the day to day story of a dinosaur in a unique perspective and not the end of the worth through meteorite extinction.  The Dino's don't talk but rather their thoughts are communicated.  I hope this way of telling animal stories catches on.  The only aspect of this movie I didn't like was the little girl telling the type of Dino's being shown whenever the opportunity came up.  Just let everything play out.  To show support for this movie I bought the Blue-Ray/DVD.  I hope the creators do few more of these telling the story of other Dino's day to day life in this style.  It can only get better...

It's as if the movie was first made as a nature documentary, and then the producers decided ""let's add celebrity voices.""

I love dinosaurs & it was so much fun to share my interest of them with the youngsters in my family.  It starts them on a road of learning & an interest in science & keeps them from just playing video games!  Keeping the movie for myself cuz I love it & will share & watch with them again for family time.",1400284800,,459,4.193181818181818

We knew that they had to re-write the script so that it was more like a ""story"" than the tv show.  It was disappointing as we are HUGE fans of the show.  I felt that they discounted a child's interest in dinosaurs and made it about poop.  I bought the movie anyway because it was beautiful to watch and my kids love dinosaurs.",1399766400,,499,4.103092783505154

It didn't hurt its popularity that one of my grandsons is named Alex! You'll have to watch the movie to understand why. Of all the DVDs I've purchased for them to watch while they're visiting, this one is their favorite by a long shot. Real life video and CGI are expertly blended to yield a visually stunning experience in Blu-ray on a large LED. Its story line has time-proven aspects of Bambi, entails sibling rivalry, puppy love, the logic of a herd (especially the constant churn in and competition for male leadership), risks from both Mother Nature and predators, and throws in some educational material on dinosaurs and early mammals along the way. Highly recommended for dinosaur lovers of all ages, but especially the budding paleontologists in your family.",1399680000,,894,4.811688311688312

She loves dinosaurs and was super excited to see it. Grandma loves kids movies too so she came along to see it. Basically, my kid loved it and my mom and I both did not.

The story is so typical of dinosaur movies. Nothing original here. Not very funny, the story is not that great, the voices are not matching to characters in my opinion, and the story starts off weird and ends weird with people digging up dinosaur bones and then a bird shows up and tells the story with him narrating it a lot.

To each their own but I suggest renting before buying this one",1399248000,,708,4.01418439716312

6137521,1,B00H7KJTMG,What's wrong with allowing the images to breathe and tell their own story? The narration was childish and didn't add to the experience. Please release a version without the dialogue.,1399075200,6,182,5.1

6137524,2,B00H7KJTMG,"My 4 year old saw this advertise and wanted to watch it, so I reluctantly downloaded the instant video version after reading the reviews. The visuals are great (reason for the 2 stars), but wow...this dialogue is horrendous. My son enjoys it (he's four, and repeats more of the actual dinosaur sound/roars when playing vs. the dialogue), but I really can't be in the same room if he's watching it. I'm glad we didn't see it at the cinema.",1398902400,5,438,4.556962025316456

6137527,1,B00H7KJTMG,I saw the preview at a theater and thought it would be a great show to watch.  I rented it to see if it would be age appropriate for my son.  I would not finish watching it.  the animation and videography and basic story is fine.  The dialog and the lines that are added to the story to narrate it are awful.,1398816000,2,308,3.9193548387096775
6137528,5,B00H7KJTMG,My 3 yr old grandson loved it.  So interesting to capture his attention.  I recommend it to anyone with young or old kids.,1398729600,,122,4.260869565217392
6137529,5,B00H7KJTMG,Recommend to any parent or grandparent. Interesing and educational. We enjoyed watching it with our grandson. The color and description was terrrific.,1398729600,,150,5.863636363636363
6137530,2,B00H7KJTMG,Bad. Just... bad. What else can I say? Story is recycled. Voice acting is flat. The ventriloquism effect of motionless mouths is an odd choice. Just bad. It's kinda pretty here and there I guess?,1398729600,,195,4.6
6137531,5,B00H7KJTMG,"A lot of people have  been saying that the dialogue in this movie isn't good, but honestly I think it would be dumb without it because even the original walking with dinosaurs has a narrator so if it was just the dinosaurs walking around making noise it would be more confusing. ESPECIALLY for the younger kids to which this movie was intended for and not adult dinosaur fans because this is really more of a family film and  not an adult documentary. So basically don't shy away from seeing it because some of the more negative reviews about the dialogue because it is an awesome movie with amazing visuals and graphics that the whole family can enjoy.",1398643200,,653,4.572649572649572

6137533,5,B00H7KJTMG,"An amazing movie! It reminds me of a live action version of the land before time movie without the singing! These dinosaurs grow and change as they grow with evolving personalities, you basically hear the thoughts of the dinosaurs and don't see their mouths move that would take away from the tales of the ancient animals. There are also some human aspects and characters thrown in and names of the scientific names of thedinosaurs are thrown in.",1398643200,2,446,4.805194805194805
6137534,4,B00H7KJTMG,It was really funny and enjoyable.  I didn't like the way it changed between the present and the past and did not tell the story of the tooth but it ended with that part.,1398643200,,170,4.0

Milly, a 4yr old, likes this as much if not more than Frozen...I didn't think Frozen was spectacular.. But she liked it enough; I'd give it 4stars... But this movie, I may have to purchase or @least get the sound track.

Do toy like exploring dinosaur bones? Do you like discovering dinosaurs that are new to you for the first time? The thing I liked about it which is the film is that at the begining. The main dinosaur which is patchyhe was adorable!  He even fell in love! (top that!) and they had a war in the end!

6137572,5,B00H7KJTMG,"First off, I'm not reviewing the theatrical version as it is a insult to the original series, and I'm sure others have already seen it and agreed that it was a travesty, so in this review, I will refer to it as the Travesty Cut.

The Cretaceous Cut however is pretty darn good, as there is no Dialogue whatsoever, and you are allowed to watch the animals without any annoying voices,(There are still pop songs in film, but I personally like them), the animation in the film is just superb, and the dinosaurs are some of the best I've seen in any movie, and there a lot more enjoyable in the cretaceous cut. The one dinosaur I like the best is Alex the Alexornis. He is beautifully rendered and  has a vivid color scheme plus(IMO) his actions and sounds make him kind of cute, that isn't to say the other dinosaurs are inferior, I just found him to be the best.

The Cretaceous cut is not Flawless. Some things that were apart of the original film just don't go well with this cut. When the Villain(a Gorgosaurus is first introduced it cuts into a sequence were In the original travesty cut, Alex explains about how Gorgosaurus was a mean predator while making fun of the size of its arms. in the Cretaceous cut, its still there, only there's no one doing the explaining. Another moment that makes this film flawed is a scene were the Main characters fall into a river, and then it rewinds. I know why they did that in the original travesty cut, but here, it just gives a hiccup to the whole experience. I wished they removed that and the Gorgosaurus scene to make this perfect, then again they probably didn't give a **** because they thought stupid things like that
Would make money in the Travesty Cut.

Now for everyone's information, the Blu-ray disk in this edition Does play on regular Blu-ray players, and no you don't need a 3D tv to see it properly. I highly recommend you all buy this Edition  Just for the cretaceous cut, Even if you don't have a Blu-ray player, I still think you should buy it for in case you will ever obtain one, the cretaceous cut is worth the price",1396828800,31,2081,4.422976501305483

There were a few things that were supposed to be funny that failed and my kids did not even realize they were supposed to be funny.  Also things like when one dino talks about acting like a ""ninja"".  I understand ninjas are very popular with kids so they are fine with it, but the fact that this predates ninja by millions of years is silly.

6137577,1,B00H7KJTMG,"As others have described, the voice dubbing is awful. Another audio track without voices, just the dinosaurs' grunts and growls would have made this 5-star. The dubbed voices are too loud and drown out the ambient sounds of water or anything else. It was a poor creative and/or marketing decision. It's beautiful-looking, and the story is nice enough and strong enough (and cliched enough, admittedly) that the voice acting adds nothing to it and in fact harms what is otherwise a great show. My kids were excited to watch this but after a while one of them started reading a book and another started playing with something else. A voiceless option would let kids use their imagination about what is happening.

Compare this to Disney's Dinosaur or the Korean Dino King. Were I to rank these three similar movies, I'd rank DD #1, Dino King #2, and WWD #3. Too bad, because WWD looks the best. If it had a voiceless track it would have dominated.

Trust me, I checked.  If you want to see the movie without the horrible dialogue, then you need to buy this version.

I also wanted to address a MAJOR question that many seem to want answered.

I want to let everyone know that even if you do NOT have a 3D blu ray player, you can STILL watch the ""Cretaceous Cut""!  I have a standard blu ray player and it's still viewable!  It is located in the Extra Features.

This film is SO much better WITHOUT the childish talk and poop jokes.  It's beautiful to watch and it's almost like you're watching a documentary.  The effects are brilliant and stunning.  The cinematography is superb and you don't need dialogue to follow the story.

I personally think this movie is wonderful.  I've loved dinosaurs since I was a child (I'm 37 now) and it's nice to watch a film like this when it's not overpowered by last minute voiceovers.

There are a few pop songs thrown in which seem a little ""out of place"" but other than that - I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",1396137600,5,1172,4.3657407407407405

This is the movie Disney's Dinosaurs could have and SHOULD have been. Seriously entertaining. Some VERY funny moments. Great one-liners. As a loooong time dinosaur and Walking With Dinosaurs series fan, having someone add dialogue to the setting was extremely entertaining. ( They NEVER once talked -- not one mouth ever moved to a spoken word here -- think MSt3k ad-lib humor ). My only regret?: We should have waited two weeks to pay $1.20 instead of being overcharged alongside our Prime membership to see it. I do have to admit, for the life of me, I cannot figure out what in the world Fleetwood Mac's Tusk had to do with the scene it was in, let alone fitting anywhere in the entire movie.",1395792000,,716,4.637795275590551

6137608,4,B00H7KJTMG,"The Deluxe Edition is definitely the best version to get if you don't want to listen to the horrible character dialogue.  The Cretaceous Edition (which is a special feature only available on the Deluxe Edition of the movie) is basically the movie with no character dialogue.  It is still in HD, however it is not in 3D (which worked fine for me since I prefer watching blu-rays in 2D). It improves the movie greatly and is worth the extra money--in my opinion.  The movie was quite easy to follow without the character dialogue.  The character dialogue was intended to make the movie appeal to children.  I haven't watched the standard version of the movie yet.  The character dialogue seems like a last minute gimmick added for its run in theaters.

As for the movie itself, the visuals are very impressive and the audio is very clear.  You can actually see the pebbled texture of the dinosaurs skin very clearly.  Some of the more pop-sounding songs (there are only short excerpts of 2 or 3) seem a little out of place on the Cretaceous Edition, but they don't last long and I didn't mind them that much.  On the whole, the soundtrack is very good.

Oddly enough, the 3D HD, 2D HD, and Cretaceous Edition are all on one Blu-ray disc.  This means there are actually 3 different versions of the movie on one disc.  The Blu-ray releases of this movie involved a similar gimmick to the Blu-ray releases of The Wolverine.  In the case of The Wolverine, the extended 2D version was only available with the 3D release of the movie.  I don't like this practice and hope it doesn't become common with Blu-ray releases, but in this case I'm glad I paid the extra four bucks.",1395705600,11,1666,4.562289562289562

6137626,1,B00H7KJTMG,"It's just so disappointing seeing a movie with such potential crash and burn. Making the dinosaurs talk was a very unfortunate, last minute, post-production decision that ruined the movie. As you may have noticed there was no talking in the first teaser trailer. So here's what went wrong:
--The dialog was full of nonstop dopey `humor' and poop jokes to the point where you can't even enjoy the film. I found myself being lost in the amazing FX for a brief moment... before being slapped in the face with a stupid wise-crack or poop joke. URG! Some have argued that: ""Well it's supposed to be fun for kids!"" NO. NO. A THOUSAND TIMES NO. The dialog is extremely patronizing to child audience's intelligence. They do not need to be spoon fed nonstop silly humor to be entertained.
--The talking NEVER STOPS. Like I said, the talking was added later in post -production and OOOooooh does it show. It doesn't match up with the film and all and feels very forced (like someone reading quickly from a script while the movie is playing in front of them). Even dark and serious moments in the film are ruined by goofy jokes. If you MUST see it... bring noise canceling headphones so you can just enjoy the visuals.
--Only the 4 main characters spoke... which was just awkward... why are the rest silent? Once again making the talking feel like it doesn't belong.
--The film pauses every time a new dinosaur appears for a child to tell you it's name and its eating habits. This `feature' really interrupts the movie and you don't learn anything (any dinosaur loving kid would already know the information given).

REMOVE THE TALKING.

The visuals are great, but that doesn't save it. I'm saying this as a lifelong hardcore dinosaur fan and paleontologist...",1391644800,131,1749,4.731147540983606
6137627,3,B00H7KJTMG,"Shot and released in 3D, Walking with Dinosaurs has very impressive CGI, re-creating the prehistoric Alaskan wilderness where dinosaurs lived. The beautifully shot landscapes and dinosaurs are worth seeing, but they hardly make up for the lack of interesting story the film really needs.

Walking with Dinosaurs follows the adventures of a young Pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi and his competitive elder brother Scowler. Patchi is also smitten with another dinosaur Juniper. There is also an Alexornis bird Alex, as a narrator and comic relief.

Those principal characters can talk as the studio provided voiceovers played by human actors. In fact, the film begins with a brief, live-action frame story where Uncle Zack (Karl Urban) takes out two kids in a car.

I know the film is primarily made for children, and filmmakers are only trying to make it easier for younger audiences to connect to the characters, but this time they went too far. There is also toilet humor that seems out of place here.

I am not sure why this film had to be made in the first place when there is an original TV series. Watching dinosaurs on a big screen is certainly thrilling; following the generic story is not.

6137629,2,B00H7KJTMG,"Walking WIth Dinosaurs is now a guaranteed box office bomb and for those of you who saw it , Its not very hard to see why. The 28 on Rotten Tomatoes is crushing this thing. Like i said , i do not hate this movie because it has animation like Frozen were its that good and since this is an animated film made by no big studio that is a compliment. The rest of this movie is a mess like a story that rips off The Lion KIng and Land Before Time which are much better films than this , I will admit Some storytelling is richly told and you can feel for some characters in the end , but as it is , it is a mess with so much filler with its characters and storytelling. This gets a C-",1390608000,3,678,3.8156028368794326

6137631,2,B00H7KJTMG,"It is tough to judge a kid's film. As an adult you don't want to sit through this one. The film uses some talking dinosaurs (some don't talk) to introduce various species of dinosaurs through a story...every fossil has a story. There are problems with this film. Our main character is annoying. The setting is modern as our grazing dinosaur herds live in climates that lack the vegetation to support them.

If the kids have to see it, pay someone to go with them so you don't have to.

Dinosaur horror and violence.

6137632,5,B00H7KJTMG,"I loved this movie and am totally perplexed to read the snarky comments of those who didn't like it.  The computer generated animation was truly amazing.  We saw it in 3D and were just blown away.  We are adults, not children.  Okay, the story was a bit simple but so what that it didn't have a complex involved story line depicting angst and betrayal in the dinosaur world.  It's a great fun movie well worth owning and watching many more times in the future.",1389398400,7,460,4.428571428571429

6137634,1,B00H7KJTMG,"We follow the story of Patchi, the pachyrhinosaurus, as he grows up to lead his herd.

What we have here is an anti-Pixar film.  Whereas that company produces film that can delight both parent and child in equal measure, this is a film that the young and old can revile together.  Its actually kind of awe-inspiring how so many intelligent people can combine their efforts and end up with such a black hole of stupidity.  The original BBC TV production was a fascinating documentary series that I enjoyed as much as my young son.  The film is a prime example of losing faith in the source material and changing it into something we have seen before in fear that the audience is too simple-minded to appreciate on the big screen what they have already demonstrated their love for on the small screen.  This means adding juvenile dialogue, including the poop and puke jokes that are requisite for any modern family film.  The result is absolute garbage.  Im not swayed by the impressive effects.  These days, everything including my cousins wedding films, has great CGI.  When my six-year-old son, who loved Turbo and adores Ultraman, says your film is stupid, you know you have utterly failed.",1389312000,53,1192,4.770731707317073
6137635,1,B00H7KJTMG,"Honestly, Im not sure how it could get any worse than this.

I was dragged to this film by my children who expressed no desire to see it until their friends invited them on a play date and I was then forced into chaperoning alongside a friend of mine who apparently got into this movie.  I don't get it, and obviously everything has an audience, but this is one of those films that just don't deserve one.  Pointless, unfunny, redundant, silly and boring; Walking with Dinosaurs is easily the worst film Ive seen all year, and itll take an absolute miracle of crap for something to dethrone it.

I said to my wife upon returning home that any film that opens with a rebel teenager opposed to fossil digging being talked to by a morphing bird and then taken on a journey in his mind to prehistoric times is just a complete a total joke.

Please get me out of this theater!

There are many problems with Walking with Dinosaurs, but that was a big one.  The films bookends are so obviously tacked on for some strange way of enticing a younger crowd.  Like making a straight up fictional documentary wouldnt work.  Instead, we have some horrible acting and a ridiculous set up that leads to some dumb story about a runt who falls in love with a girl from a separate pack only to have his bullish brother take her out from under him and he has to come back and earn everyones respect because hes obviously smarter than the rest of those dumb animals.  The entire movie being narrated by John Leguizamo trying his hand at a bizarre accent that resembles no notable ethnicity is bad enough, but the fact that these animals are all communicating telepathically (yes, their mouths never move) is a distraction and makes it pretty clear that this was originally intended to be a mere documentary with narration and was scrapped for this great idea (note the sarcasm).

'Walking with Dinosaurs' somewhat plays out like an extended episode of 'Dino Dan' (some horrible kids show I'm forced to stomach every once and a while) and has these pointless pauses in the story to explain what each dinosaur is, how to pronounce their names and what their names mean.  It takes you out of the story (what story?) and further confirms that this movie was really supposed to be something else altogether and got butchered in production hell.

The graphics are decent, but nothing noteworthy, and as I mentioned, the story is just plain dumb.  Follow that up with some terribly redundant jokes and awful delivery (it was funny the first time Alex, the bird, stopped talking to eat a bugbut the next thirty times were just unnecessary) and you have a film that is an absolute chore to get through.",1389225600,28,2672,4.586134453781512
6137636,3,B00H7KJTMG,"I was almost not going to see this movie but I decided it looked pretty cool. One thing I didn't like was it can't decide if it wants to be a documentary or just a normal movie. The graphics were really good and the baby dinos are cute but pretty much I think only kids would truly appreciate it, probably older kids because some scenes are pretty scary.",1389139200,4,354,4.220588235294118
6137637,4,B00H7KJTMG,"I read a ton of reviews about how horrible the added dialog was so I went into the theatre with very low expectations, but my 4 year old son really wanted to see this. Maybe because I was expecting it to be extremely annoying, it ended up being okay. It's no more silly in dialog than other animated films (think Ice Age, Happy Feet) with kids as the target audience. So if you're expecting a documentary then I can understand the disappointment. If you go into it knowing it's a kids animated movie based on those actual documentaries others have referenced, then I think you will be able to enjoy it with your young children.",1388880000,4,627,4.460869565217391

6137639,2,B00H7KJTMG,"Computer-generated dinosaurs are no longer as novel when Jurassic Park and Dinosaur wowed audiences awhile back. The ones in WWD are competently realized, to be sure, with solid attention to Paleontological details. But there is too little creativity in WWD, so the animation is largely ..... pedestrian (as in ""walking,"" get it?).

In addition, to secure a family-friendly PG rating, the tooth-and-claw reality of herbivore vs. carnivore is underplayed. No blood is ever in evidence, despite the robust duels and attacks -- and conflict is easily resolved and glossed over. To be more candid about this would have given a greater drama to the dangers of seasonal survival and migrations. We get lots of butt and poop humor instead.

And this leads me to the script and character voicing, two elements that sink this film for anyone but the most easily entertained. The writing is inane and out of synch with the lives the dinosaurs lead. Wise-cracking and adolescent rivalry are dolloped on as heavily as dinosaur droppings -- brontosaurus grade. This asphyxiates the pathos that underlines the story which in structure is comparable to Disney's ""The Lion King."" There the comparison stops. The latter is an enduring classic; DWD evaporates as the credits roll.

In addition, the film score is way too varied (& unmemorable) and often mismatches the action on the screen. Only 4 characters have voices and anthropological intelligence: Pachy, his older brother, Pachy's love interest Juniper, and an irritating pre-historic bird voiced by John Leguizimo. The later wearied me after less than 2 minutes on screen. Every other animal: dinosaurs, pre-historic birds and primitive mammals just squeak, squawk, roar and snarl and act out of instinct, instead of the intelligence written into the 4 voicing characters. This makes for an uneven and annoying film that is already hobbled by forced plot contrivances.",1388534400,5,1909,5.23202614379085

6137641,1,B00H7KJTMG,"Neil Nightingale and Barry Cook direct the BBC Earth animated adventure, Walking with Dinosaurs, starring the voice of John Leguizamo as a bird named Alex (named after his Alexomis species) who takes viewers back to the Cretacious period (roughly 70 million years ago). There, he narrates and interacts with his dinosaur buddy, Patchi (Pachyrhinosaurus), voiced by Justin Long, who is initially the runt of his family. At an early age, Patchi learns about the various dinosaurs and birds living in his area (Alaska), along with the generalized theme: survival of the fittest.

As winter approaches, his herd prepares to migrate south for the winter. While following the path to their destination, he and his older brother, Scowler (Skyler Stone), have a life-altering encounter with a pack of meat-eating Gorgosaurus (just imagine a small version of T-Rex). Eventually, they reconnect with their herd and Patchi establishes an emotional friendship with fellow herd member, Juniper (Tiya Sircar). In the days and years ahead, the once young group ascends into adulthood, facing various challenges, including a brotherly rivalry in regards to who will lead the herd into the future.

Dinosaurs have really lost their flavor in the post Jurassic Park era. Naturally, there's been successful films featuring dinosaurs since the original Jurassic Park, like Journey to the Center of the Earth and Dinosaur, but when a film features animatronic dinosaurs chasing after humans, it really takes the thrill out of watching dinosaurs in any other environment. In their natural habitat, dinosaurs are limited to walking around and randomly eating anything and everything in sight  at least everything that isn't composed of dirt or rock. And, sadly  that's about all you'll get if you make the decision to watch this particular film.

The Walking with Dinosaurs designation comes from the title of a popular BBC television documentary that aired in the United Kingdom and on the Discovery Channel in the United States right around the end of 1999. Just like the film's title, it follows a group of animated dinosaurs endlessly migrating from one place to another. There's so much walking going on over the course of this brief (not even 90 minutes) film that at times it will feel like it's moving just as slow as they are. Regardless, one would assume this film would be some kind of spin-off or continuation of the television miniseries. If you're thinking about watching this film under that assumption, you're in for some monumental disappointment.

To be quite honest, this film would have been much more unique without all the voice-overs. There was really no need for a narrator, voice actors, or the absolutely out of place opening/final scene where Karl Urban makes a cameo has an uncle attempting to spend time with his niece and nephew. This brief appearance just felt completely wrong, largely because he was playing a happy-go-lucky character. He's currently well-established playing moody characters, like Judge Dredd and Dr. McCoy from Star Trek. Those aren't exactly the most cheerful roles, so when you see him being so happy and cheerful here, it's almost a shock to the system.

Without a doubt, the voice over work absolutely ruins this film. John Leguizamo, who is a relatively recognizable face in several films these days, is also a pretty successful voice actor. His voice is so recognizable (mainly from voicing Sid the sloth in the Ice Age films) that you'd think whoever made the casting choices for this film would have been better off using someone less associated with prehistoric animated films. I'll admit, hearing his voice in this film bothered me to no end because of his prominent role in Ice Age. And, while we're on the subject of speaking roles, does anyone know why some dinosaurs in this film can talk and others can only grunt? If there's humor in that somewhere, it honestly escapes me.

If you're wondering how the animation looks, believe me when I say there's no debating that it's the most impressive part of this film. These dinosaurs look more realistic than ever (at least in animated form)  but that's to be expected these days with multiple state-of-the-art animation studios around the world. Still, the $80 million budget that went into this film seems a bit excessive. It's hard to imagine actors like Justin Long or John Leguizamo commanding that much of a pay day. Based on the limited interest and documentary-style, it really makes you wonder how a studio justifies putting that much money into a movie like this...

Overall, Walking with Dinosaurs is a film reserved for children with an interest in dinosaurs. To some young ones, there might be a moderate amount of entertainment here  and it does contain a few positive theme-based messages, like the importance of developing self-confidence and facing down criticism. However, this film is still mostly dull and unoriginal, focusing far too much on insignificant moments, like trying to make jokes about a dinosaur's tiny arms. I realize one of the film's goals was to introduce new dinosaurs, but they could have at least incorporated a few familiar faces, like T-Rex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, or Raptors. But, at the end of the day, you'll have to settle for impressive animation that's horribly overshadowed by annoying voice work, a poorly designed plot, unfamiliar dinosaurs, and characters that are completely mundane.
