7936787,5,B00005B6KF,"This singing cowboy is one of the most famous---for his early television shows, his singing and his land owning.  A very astute actor who portrayed the old west in a lively way...yet, held onto a sense of goodness and innocence.",1396224000,,228,4.7

7936790,5,B00005B6KF,"This DVD is the typical Gene Autry Western.  Each show portrays great moral value and ideals.  In ""The Star Toter,"" Gene show a young boy that the good guys can come out the winner, thus overshadowing the bad influences of a father on the wrong side of the law.  In ""The Posse"" Gene show that everyone deserves a second chance, when he helps an ex-con who refused to give into backmail from the bad guys. These are just two examples that the children that grew up watching Gene Autry learned from.  In ""Doubleswitch"" and ""Blackwater Valley Feud"", Gene tangles with the bad guys and as always, the cowboy in the white hat is Hero again.  The Wrigley Chewing Gum commercials are a flash back into the early years when life was simpler and the Silver Screen legends like Gene Autry were looked up to as role models.  The picture quality is great.  As an Autry Fan and Collector I give this DVD 5 stars and I strongly urge you to let your children watch the man who as country Singer Johnny Cash once said was ""a champion riding on Champion"" for a good dose of moral integrity and values.  All this Autry Fan can say is ""I am glad that Gene Autry Still Rides The Trail.""  America still needs a Hero like him today!!!",1025136000,7,1212,4.375
7936791,5,B00005B6KF,"Now that I have had a chance to see two  of the episodes of this DVD, I would like to to make an additional comment about the shows episodes, the background music is almost unbearable. The music shows no relationship to the action whatsoever, it really grates on the nerves. This is a great pity, because it spoils to some extent what are excellent shows. The shows as I said before have been excellently copied and restored, the shows have all the ingredients of good Gene Autry westerns, good music, plenty of action and have a good moral theme. It's a pity that Gene Autry didn't pick a musical director who knew how to add the proper music ,and when not to add music, to his shows.",990662400,7,685,4.393700787401575
