203192,1,1933057696,"Let me preface this with, ""I LOVED reading Dr Stewart's 'Healing Oils of the Bible' book!  I respect Dr Stewart very, very much!! When I saw there was a Bible study available, I was ecstatic!  I waited quite awhile for the delivery of this DVD to accompany the companion Bible Study booklets. After finally receiving it, I was expecting the quality of this production to be as fantastic as David Stewart's publishing. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!  The production and presentation quality of this DVD as a tool to teach and/or lead the ""Healing"" Bible study were absolutely horrible!  Dr Stewart has an amazing wealth of information to share. The books he has written are fantastic and extremely easy to read and follow, with a wealth of excellent information! But Dr Stewart is NOT a public speaker. I don't know any other way to put it. It is bad. I asked my Pastor to review it b/c we were co-facilitating the study and he had an even worse rating!

And the accompanying ""help"" DVD for leaders and facilitators?? Agh! Even worse! I know there is good content within these DVDs, and the subject matter should be able to carry the load, but the manner in which this visual aid was produced is of no help.

PLEASE, for the sake of all of us who wish to present such valuable information regarding the wonderful gifts God has given us, PLEASE hire a professional speaker who can offer the viewer something to capture their interest! I am too embarrassed to play this DVD in our Bible study b/c I fear losing my participants before the first session is over. We will not use it.

 I am truly SORRY to be so blunt, but all of this is true. I have no disrespect for Dr Stewart at all, but PLEASE just keep on researching and writing.... Your talent lies there!",1393804800,47,1748,4.544585987261146
203193,5,1933057696,These dvds are excellent. I plan to buy several more to share with friends. His information is deep and easy to understand. I will listen to it again and again....so much to learn. Can I say again....excellent presentation!!!!,1386115200,10,226,4.973684210526316
203194,5,1933057696,We are more than half-way through this DVD series and have been pleasantly surprised by how information this is.  It is helpful to be able to go back and replay it as necessary.  The music and background is complementary and pleasant as well.  Very informative.,1384214400,12,261,4.7555555555555555

203196,4,1933057696,"Love the info, Love everything Young Living, and have respect for Dr. Stewart. That said, I think the videos could use a little updating, as far as presentation goes, and perhaps a different approach on the organization of it all. Either way, I don't regret my purchase and would recommend on the messages, alone. Though, I highly suggest getting the book, as well.",1424736000,3,365,4.809523809523809

203198,5,1933057696,"I'm hosting a Bible study using this DVD and the study guide and we're learning much about God's EOs and how we can use them in our daily life for healing body, mind and spirit.",1411430400,3,177,4.085714285714285
203199,1,1933057696,Not worth the money.,1410393600,,20,4.25
203200,2,1933057696,This is just a sales marketing tool for Youngliving multilevel down line. The 1st DVD was informative on their oils but the second DVD was just telling you what the first DVD was telling you. I think it should be advertised as a marketing tool. If you are in that company it would be a great tool for you.,1407888000,6,305,4.186440677966102

203204,5,1933057696,"I prefer DVD's over CD's for Bible Study, as I am hearing impaired. The speaker/narrator is not dynamic, by any means, but if you are open to learning more about THE ORIGINAL MEDICINE, that God gave us during creation, as opposed to synthetic drugs that are doing nothing to Heal you.....this might be just what you are looking for in a good basic course.",1396915200,14,355,4.5625
