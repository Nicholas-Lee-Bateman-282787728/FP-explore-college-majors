7932158,2,B000056IE8,"I agree with another reviewer who said it teaches incorrect phonics! Also, they made odd choices for some of the letters. For example, for ""I"" they say 'insect' - but of course my toddler says ""I"" is for bug! Which I have to then correct every time. They could easily have used ""igloo"" from one of the Maisy episodes, where Maisy and Charlie play inside one. But the worst is the letter X. They say ""X"" is in 'excited' and 'excuse me'!!! Ridiculous! Especially since they immediately show Maisy and all her friends playing instruments - and Eddie is playing a XYLOPHONE! Duh! The only reason I gave this video 2 stars instead of 1, is that my daughter loves it. I do not - there are better videos to teach the alphabet and phonics.",1129593600,,731,4.4222222222222225
7932159,1,B000056IE8,I had to return this tape because it was damaged when received - to date I have NOT received the replacement.  Tape was send back and received by the seller 10 days ago.,1125964800,,169,4.121212121212121
7932160,1,B000056IE8,"I bought this video because my 2 year old adores Maisy, which she sees on ""Noggin"".  However, I  had to cringe, horrified when I watched this:  the phonics taught in this ABC video are tremendously WRONG.  For example, ""B"" is for ""buh"".  ""S"" is for ""suh""  (should be ""ssss"").  ""T' is for ""tuh""  (should be ""ttt"").

As a reading specialist, I can't tell how many children have developed problems in decoding due to this type of faulty phonics instruction.

If, for instance, your child tried to phonetically sound out the word, ""big"" - she would say ""buh-ig"".  Or for ""snake"":  ""suh-nake"".

Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.

Do NOT buy this video.  It is extremely bad pedagogy!

As much as we love Maisy, we are exchanging it for another story.",1098576000,10,734,4.645669291338582
7932161,5,B000056IE8,"My now-4-year-old watched this tape many times over the course of a few months, and, honest-to-goodness, it taught him to read. Now I'm buying a copy for my 20-month-old to see if it eventually does the same for him.",1088553600,,216,4.564102564102564
7932162,5,B000056IE8,"i love this video, primarily because it doesn't concentrate on A B C D but rather ah, be, ce, de... it makes much more sense to try and teach kids how to read/spell by using the annunciation method, and this video does a great job of it.",1053734400,3,237,4.0638297872340425
7932163,5,B000056IE8,"My 2.5 yr old has learned the alphabet, numbers, colors and shapes from Maisy. We have all the videos and only wish that there were more.",1042502400,4,137,4.3076923076923075
7932164,4,B000056IE8,"My daughter has always enjoyed Maisy books and videos and she received this video for Christmas.  Rather than have short stories this is one long video concentrating on the alphabet.  Each letter is given a couple of minutes and several words are highlighted.  Not only do they show the letter but have many words so you can hear the sound and also use the words in sentences.  I think the video has really helped my daughter's vocabularly, sentence building skills and pronouncation.  A great Maisy video - any Maisy fan would love it.",1017187200,4,536,4.720430107526882
7932165,5,B000056IE8,"It's wonderful. My two-years-old son like it very much. He watches the video at least four times a week. He also watches ""Count with Maisy"".  He is now crazy for Maisy and likes all the product of Maisy.  He learns many words from the video.",1004486400,4,241,4.333333333333333
