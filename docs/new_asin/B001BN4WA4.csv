3495294,5,B001BN4WA4,"This Solomon Amazon reviewer is an idiot. First off, Aria is not a shoujo series. I can't say exactly what it is... it's not exactly seinen, but it is most definitely not shoujo. (I've read/watched hundreds of shoujo manga/anime... I know shoujo when I see it) This guy name-throws in Azumanga Daioh (is it the one other anime he's seen?) even though it has absolutely nothing in common with Aria. Azumanga isn't even slice-of-life. Yes, there is a genre name for this kind of show. It's ""slice-of-life."" There is no overarching plot or intense drama. It's a subtler form of escapism, and it's only boring for ""older viewers"" with zero attention span and no appreciation for this kind of anime. This isn't really a kids anime, either. I'd think most kids would be bored to death by Aria. Like Kokoro Toshokan (another slice-of-life anime--not as good as Aria, but worth a look nonetheless), it takes you to a very romanticized version of the world, and eases you into its pace for a while.

That said, I was not so -very- impressed when watching the first season for the first time. I thought it merely a fairly good show. It was during the second season that I really fell in love with Neo-Venezia and its characters. By the third season it was one of my favorite anime of all time.",1230940800,33,1283,4.602620087336245
3495295,4,B001BN4WA4,"It's rather hard to explain this anime. If you are a fan of Azumanga Daioh, you will appreciate the rather slow moving, meandering story line. It's nice to see the beautiful animation and the characters and music all flow nicely. My only complaint is that it does border a little bit on a little too much simplicity. There were a few times where my attention started to waver. Also, having been to Venice a few times, I did like the concept of recreating that city on another planet, but at times the buildings and background seemed a little too bland. I did enjoy this anime, but I don't think many people would do the extreme slow pace. However I am looking forward to season 2, to see if they up the ante a little with some more complex stories and character developement.",1229644800,,775,4.464788732394366
3495296,4,B001BN4WA4,"I downloaded Aria the Animation (and it's next seasons) because there wasn't a box set or DVDs available.

Now Right Stuf brings us a box set for the first season of the Aria story.

You receive a rough cardboard box. This isn't flimsy cardboard, nor is it double corrugated. Feels more like a hardcover book's material. It houses 4 slim DVD cases and the ""Guide to Neo Venezia"", which is a nice addition that features character art and some fun facts that are presented though the series, but in a more informative setup. We miss out on 2 DVD covers, since the Japanese release was in a 6 volume set. Akira and Athena are left out of the box art.

The episodes themselves (13) are split 4-3-3-3 on the DVDs. The quality is great, the series has more color and warmth than the TV rips that I have. Though the TV rips look sharper, I believe this to be from a lack of color. Though the trade off is not having intro credits and TV sponsor delays.

Now here's why I didn't give this fantastic bundle a 5. Years ago the anime companies decided to make their subtitles this awful yellow with karaoke text in white. I'm sad to say this hasn't changed.

Please, PLEASE use at least white thin type. The TV rips have this nice white font type with a blue outline that looks GORGEOUS! And the karaoke fades as the song progresses through the lyrics. I will not believe that it takes a great deal of time to make the font prettier and more appealing without increasing the costs of the package.

Also, this set DOES NOT include English dubs. I can't tell whether  this is a good thing or bad thing. By not making a dub it decreases production values, makes the set cheaper, and allows for better quality video to be on the DVD. But on the other hand a series like this begs for a great cast to be assembled. Maybe they'll make a dub set in the future.

I'm not going to complain much though. I have a GREAT anime series in a quality box with nice bonuses packed on the DVDs, not to mention the free guide and the fact that it's finally available.",1225152000,4,2037,4.31413612565445
3495297,4,B001BN4WA4,"ARIA is a beautifully crafted piece of anime, brought to life by Junichi Sato (Sailor Moon, Kaliedo Star and others).  His optimistic characters shine through and this ""slice of life"" series about gondoliers on a foreign idyllic water planet called Aqua has life and substance.  The stories are as light as air, and deal with three girls and their mentors as they train their hardest and most earnestly to become Prima Undines, gondaliers who scull boats through the water canals of a Neo-Venice.

The color and art design are breathtaking, water lapping, gorgeous blues and golds washing the screen to give a cool, soft feel.  There are the typical episodes, such as the one where the girls go on a mission to train, but the training turns out to be different than they expect.  A cat goes missing.  There's a trip back into time to see the past in the present's eyes.  There is the hot springs episode, the holiday episode... but its all well done and has a calm, uplifting feel to it all.

Those who enjoyed series such as Haibane Remnei, Somedays Dreamers and other slow moving, slice of life series will find themselves right at home here.  It's calming, beautiful to watch and has a charming sense to it too.

All 13 episodes are represented from the first season/series.  Japanese language with English subtitles (there is NO dub).  An array of bonus features populate the four discs, including one that shows clips of the director in Venice (with commentary) by Sato, which is quite entertaining.",1225065600,10,1504,4.786821705426356
3495318,5,B001BN4WA4,"This series is, simply put, a masterpiece. Every detail, from the characters to the pacing to the scenery to the soundtrack, is expertly crafted to create an immersive atmosphere of pleasant calm and relaxation. Those looking for a gripping story will likely be disappointed, but they're also missing the point. Not to say that there's no plot whatsoever (it is there if you look for it, it's just quite subtle and slow-paced), but the focus of this series is not really to tell a story in the first place. Rather, it's to draw you into another world, a wonderful utopian future made that way not so much by the power of technology, but rather by the brighter side of human nature rising to the fore. The pace may be leisurely, the characters highly idealized, and the conflict minimal (when it exists at all), but the experience is anything but boring. In fact, it's precisely that leisurely, idealized, low-conflict setup that makes it so great -- it's all about taking the time to savor the beautiful and wonderful. It's the sort of inactivity that accompanies restful contentment, more ""kicking back to sit and enjoy the nice weather on your day off"" rather than ""watching paint dry"".

Aria is a show that can legitimately change your outlook on life, inspiring you to slow down and look more carefully for the little everyday miracles in life. But even if it doesn't have quite that profound of an impact on you, it's still at the very least an excellent way to relax and unwind. I have yet to find anything that beats a nice cup of tea and an episode of Aria to unwind after a long, stressful day. Or even just a normal, not especially stressful day, for that matter.

Simply put, this is one show that I simply cannot recommend enough. The artwork is gorgeous; the music is to die for; the characters are quite colorful and likeable; and overall the execution of the whole thing is just fantastic. Regardless of age, gender, or even whether you're particularly into anime as a general rule, Aria is a true gem that anyone can enjoy.",1373587200,,2039,4.645429362880886
3495319,5,B001BN4WA4,"This series is very well done and stays pretty close to the manga. The first season is pretty good, but its the second and third seasons that bring it to life.  This is definitely a ""slice-of-life"" anime and if you want to see a bunch of fights, gore, or nudity, then this isn't for you. If you want to see something that is somewhat peaceful, sometimes humorous, and a bit nostalgic then it is. This is definitely one of my favorite animations, but it is definitely not for everyone.",1361923200,,484,4.438202247191011

3495322,5,B001BN4WA4,"As a big fan of anime, Sci-Fi, and political fiction: If 1984 and the Lathe of Heaven describe the worse possible, ARIA describes what is the best possible - the anti-Orwellian per say (""anti"" is such a negative word to describe something beautiful like ARIA - ha!). As some reviewers pointed out - ARIA stands out itself as different what ""anime"" and its typical genres are. In fact, I think the best enjoyment that one can get out from ARIA is to stop considering ARIA as a stereotypical anime of big robots and exciting action, but as an animated poetry of beauty.

Regardless, the underline is - ARIA is the manga/anime I reach for after tough day of in the real world - an escape from the non-stop reporting of terrible news on TV, and office/work stress and politics. Highly recommended for anyone who want something to relax to, something to dream for what perfect life will be. While ARIA is Sci-Fi (and anime), but it is great title to who are traditionally not anime and Sci-Fi fans. I do think ""older"" people will enjoy ARIA better - to who have seen the harsh realities, are the ones who long more for the utopia.",1280880000,4,1125,4.514705882352941
3495323,5,B001BN4WA4,"I agree wholeheartedly with Nat.  The Amazon reviewer seems very confused and inept.  This is clearly one of the most beautifully plotted and executed anime series ever to come out of Japan.  The American dubbing also does it full service.  Apparently the reviewer is looking for another gundam or tenchi derivative, which this is most certainly not.  Instead it is a gorgeous attempt to portray an idyllic lifestyle.  One can argue, as the Amazon reviewer (Solomon) does at least implicitly, that Aria the Anime is not somehow not ""real"".  Hello!  What anime is??  Where has this reviewer been the past several years.  (Hence, Nat's comment -- 'is it the one other anime he's seen?' now appears very appropriate.) Given that the Amazon reviewer is looking for ""reality"" in Japanese Anime, one has to, like Nat, wonder how much anime this fellow has actually really watched.
I actually am an older, and fairly sophisticated, viewer; and, contrary to the reviewers (unsupported) claims, I was anything but bored.  Instead, I found myself increasingly entranced with the complex 'slice-of-life' (as Nat aptly puts it) Aria draws one into.  In regard to classification, the reviewer again gets it wrong.  The proof of the pudding so to speak is in how outlets classify anime.  I went to several shoujo listings, like that at Anime-planet, and none of them appear list Aria as a shoujo release.  Therefore, one inescapably concludes that the reviewer is both inept and mistaken in this also.  I think the bottom line is that this Amazon reviewer came into the review process with preconceived notions of what this anime release was, or should be. But, because was not at all what he had envisioned, it led to some fairly miscued attempts to somehow pigeon-hole it with unrelated anime sub-classes.  I am not sure how Amazon selects its reviewers, but this is definitely a case of a square peg in a round hole.",1271376000,9,1905,4.903125
3495324,5,B001BN4WA4,"The Amazon reviewer is completely out of it, as other reviewers have rightly said.

In fairness, it's not easy to describe this series in a way which conveys just how good it is, and why it creates that ""just one more"" feeling which makes you watch half the episodes at a sitting ...

There's no plot worth mentioning, the setting is about as close to paradise as you will ever see, and all the characters are just so ... nice. By rights it ought to be terminally dull and horribly twee. It isn't, but it's not so easy to explain why not.

I think what makes this special is that, strangely, there is always, somewhere in the background, a deep melancholy. The planet Aqua is a paradise, sure, but it wasn't always so; people suffered and died to make it the way it is, and in some way, the planet remembers. The Undines' life is blissful, but they know they will grow up and leave this life one day. The effect is a bit like remembering a very happy childhood, from a perspective of maturity; a happy time that it's delightful to remember, but which will never come again.

The reviewer has it quite wrong for this reason. The series is much more likely to appeal to older viewers than to small girls, who won't pick up on the sadness, or will just be mystified or bored.

""Aria"" certainly isn't for everybody. It's just about the polar opposite of a Giant Mecha anime. But people on its wavelength will want to buy all three of the series, believe me.",1265241600,16,1453,4.386617100371748
3495325,5,B001BN4WA4,Cheerful but not too sappy. In fact one character yells at another one for sappy lines. The guidebook they provide gives background information for people who did not read the manga and is a fun read also.,1252627200,,205,4.5675675675675675
3495326,5,B001BN4WA4,"It is nice to watch an anime without attacking aliens or evil syndicates [Haruhi]; this anime ponders those quiet ""wonderful"" moments in life. This can easily be mistaken as 'escapism' but maybe the more ""sensational"" anime are the ones that should carry that label. Breath ...relax ...enjoy.",1243555200,,292,5.23404255319149
3495327,5,B001BN4WA4,"""Aria"" is one of those series that drifts along without much of a plotline, but it's so beautiful that it doesn't need one.

The main story focuses on Akari Mizunashi, who is training to become an Undine, a professional gondolier and tour guide for Aqua. She works for the Aria gondola company in Neo-Venezia. However, she spends most of her time chatting and relaxing with her friends, the hard-working Aika and the shy, reserved high school student Alice.

However, Aqua itself is one of the most scenic planets, due to the wide expanse of water surrounding the entire planet. Believe or not, the planet actually becomes a character in this series, with plenty of mysterious spirits.

Because of the gorgeous backgrounds, the detailed character designs and the incredible voice actors, ""Aria"" is a masterpiece of art--it's the most wonderful oceanic utopia in an anime.

And Akari, her friends and her mentors make for excellent characters. One especially touching episode centers on the three gondolier mentors telling Akari, Aika and Alice how they became close friends when they were young. It's a nostalgic and impressive character analysis of the laid back gondolier Alicia, the perfectionist Alicia and the clumsy diva Athena.

With a lovable cast of characters and one of the most relaxing landscapes, it's no surprise that ""Aria"" is one of the best anime of 2008. I look forward to watching season two of ""Aria"" as well.

The season set is packed with great special features as well, such as interviews with the Japanese voice actors, clean opening and ending sequences and a special set of episodes called ""Venice, I'm sorry!"" These episodes document director Sato's trip to Venice, and how he integrated these shots into the anime. Also keep in mind that there are no dubs--the entire series is in Japanese.",1239321600,2,1819,5.006622516556291

8283678,4,B001BN4WA4,"In the future, humankind are expert terraformers, and in our finest hour we took a desert planet and covered it with water. Christened Aqua, the planet is now home to interstellar tourist trap Neo-Venezia, a replica of the Italian city constantly plied by gondolas piloted by young women known as Undines.

Mizunashi Akari has come to Aqua to work as an Undine at the Aria Company, one of the four major gondola companies on the planet and inspiration for the title of the series, ""Aria: The Animation."" As she trains for the demanding role of an Undine, she makes friends with the trainees at the other companies and explores the pristine world of Aqua.

""Aria"" is perhaps the slice-of-life-iest slice-of-life anime Ive ever seen. Akari is sweet, the townspeople are friendly, conflict is limited to the challenges the protagonists face as Undines-in-training. There is mystery, adventure, and a bit of excitement, but never serious danger or darkness.

The series has a certain rhythm. It wants the viewer to drift along with Akari, like a passenger in her gondola, and take in the world as it goes by. Although the animation itself is not especially sophisticated, the backgrounds and scenery are gorgeous, and actually merit the attention and drinking-in the show encourages viewers to give them. The music sets the mood without getting overbearing (the closing theme is a standout).

The pace and tenor of the show are restrained, but the characters slowly grow on you until you find yourself genuinely rooting for them. The cast is composed largely of archetypestheres the Sweet One, the Loud One, and the Precocious Child, among othersso the way they become people we enjoy spending time with is something of a surprise, albeit a pleasant one.

Pleasant: thats the word to describe Aria. Even at its most frantic, the show is somehow calming. When you're feeling stressed or hurried and you need to take a deep breath and slow down, this is the DVD to reach for. Its easy to relax into this soothing series and let the waters of Aqua carry your cares away.

8283679,5,B001BN4WA4,"I have to concur entirely with Nat. The Amazon reviewer is a clueless idiot. Aria could - and it would be really, really stretching it - be maybe classified as shojo - but I'm a guy in my 30's, a light heavyweight karate blackbelt with 15+ years of competitive experience - and I still wholeheartedly love it (though it would be a bit embarrassing to admit in real life). it's just so pure, innocent and sweet, while at the same time often paying attention to a lot of the little yet important things that make life worth living - an appreciative nod from an old friend, a genuine and honest joy from someone you just met after going out of your way to help them, a sincere awe at seeing someone's being really skilled and good at what they do, a childish awe of the beauty of nature or the wonderworks of engineering genius, a sad appreciation of someone' subdued sorrow for someone you really care about, or the many, many, many other little things that make Aria so magical.

for me, it's those little, understated emotions and modest situations that make Aria so mindblowingly cute and relaxing to watch. although I don't really think many people under 30 can appreciate it all. the author of the manga is around 40 now and was 30 when the first Aria manga was published, so it's really nothing for children in my opinion.

and that's not mentioning all the other beauty of the series - the impressionistic backgrounds, the cute trademark funny-faces the characters make in appropriate situations, the beautiful and very well-matched music, the superbly skilled seiyuu (names like Oohara Sayaka and Saito Chiwa speak for themselves), or the surrealistically-phantastic episodes where Akari travels into the past of Aqua.

to put it short, Aria was the reason I went to Venezia in July (not all that far away, 5-hour drive from Switzerland where I live, but still - normally I wouldn't bother). and Aria made the real place seem way sweeter and more interesting than it probably is when seen objectively.",1386374400,,2007,4.728571428571429
8283680,5,B001BN4WA4,"This is just an Anime that helds pictures from the heart.  No fancy machines, no figths: just a great relaxing yet wonderfull history that carries your soul in a beautiful fantasy world.  What makes this anime so great are just the way the told the story by using the caracters and by putting them into funny or tender situations in wich you can see them how the next story is created.

The only thing i dislike of this anime, is the lack of more seasons to continue the story.

If you can use 25 minutes a day to forget the whole day of trouble and watch this anime, you will feel ligthhearted and renewed - even motivate for the next episode the next day.

8283681,5,B001BN4WA4,"When Kozue Amano conceived the manga series for Aria (it's original title was Aqua) upon which Aria: The Anime is based, he aimed for a utopian fantasy series. Amano has said as much in interviews, and you can find similar notes to this theme on various sites discussing the show. Personally, I learned about Aria: The Animation from a loved one and decided to get the DVD set of the first season after watching a clip where Athena (a top Undine/Gondolier) sings an angelic melody that truly embodies its overall viewing experience. Here you will find an emphasis on the natural wonders that surround people every day, from the simple pleasures of watching the first snowfall of winter to mysterious happenings no one can explain. The whole point of Aria is to enjoy each moment for what it brings, which is one reason why you get a lead character like Akari, who finds whatever she does sheer bliss.

The story takes place on another planet terraformed to resemble Venice (or, at least, the place focused on by the show), but most of the time you can forget this fact. To tell the truth, in the anime that fact doesn't really matter so much as how beautiful the location itself has become through the hard efforts of the people who genuinely care to see Aqua prosper. If you want an anime with a lot of drama or action, Aria may not be what you're looking for--but there are so many anime with drama and action available that having a series that's sweet and easy-going is a pleasant change of pace. I've relaxed after many a stressful workday by putting on an episode while sipping tea. It calms you down and reminds you how wonderful the world can be, and the kindness people can possess.

Besides that, the soundtrack for Aria is gorgeous. Celtic Women fans (and everyone else, of course) would doubtless love listening to Athena sing, and the orchestration for most moments in the series makes for soothing background music. The producers and director for Aria: The Animation also went out of their way to make this series beautiful. It's an art-lover's dream animated for all to enjoy.

In short,  if you can walk away from watching Aria feeling just a little bit better about yourself or life in general, then Amano has done his job well.",1381708800,,2245,4.647355163727959

There is very little that could be described as ""action"". The adventures are quiet and slow paced, the people friendly and the atmosphere mostly on the soothing side.
