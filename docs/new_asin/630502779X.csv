7880647,2,630502779X,"I am a huge Jerry Lee Lewis fan, and it's with reluctance
I don't recommend this dvd.  I have often wondered why
D.A. Pennebaker's fim of the 1969 Toronto Rock 'n Roll
Revival Peace Festival has never been released as a whole.
Now I know why, bad sound.  Of course the sound of
the live performances is great compared to the sound
of the archaic video clips interspersed among the live
performances.  While watching this dvd I constantly had
to adjust the volume.  The sound of the old video clips
is way below that of the live segments.  As for the live
performances you get barely audible piano on most
songs, tinny guitar, and too much bass.  Only the
drums seem to have been recorded properly.  As for
Jerry's performance I would say it's about average for
that time period.  There are other dvds of this festival,
one with Little Richard, and the recently released
John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, all using Pennebaker's
film footage.  After watching this dvd, I will probably
pass them up.  If you want to see Jerry in his prime,
get the Austin City Limits 1983 show on dvd.",1246406400,9,1077,4.5625

7880649,5,630502779X,"I've just ""discovered"" Jerry Lee Lewis since getting the ""Last Man Standing"" CD. I have always known of his existence, but not much of his music. I recently got this DVD and I have to agree with the reviewer that said it was a ""truly orgasmic experience"". This man was hot back in 1969. He is incredible. My only wish is that it would have been about 3 hours longer. Now all I want is more Jerry Lee. Wow. What a show.",1170460800,7,418,4.109756097560975

No doubt in my mind that he still ""has it"" and any fan of his will ""want it""!  He literally rocks the stage! Don't miss this downright orgasmic experience!",1122249600,8,212,4.861111111111111
