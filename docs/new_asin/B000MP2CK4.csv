8170479,2,B000MP2CK4,I bought this to use in my classroom thinking it would be a little more exciting for 6th graders.  I found it to be stale and a real drag.,1468195200,,138,3.7586206896551726
8170480,2,B000MP2CK4,"I was disappointed in Peter O'Toole's performance. He's a great actor and I thought he'd make an excellent Holmes. Maybe he was not feeling well the day he recorded the voiceover.

This is not bad for young kids so I would not rule it out for small children as an early intro to the Holmes Canon. There are three others he did but unfortunately they arrived with the discs loose and sliding around in the package so I'm sending those back. I will repurchase them and hopefully they will have been recorded on a better day for Mr. O'Toole.",1420329600,,538,4.434343434343434

8170484,4,B000MP2CK4,A very well done adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's excellent plot. High quality entertainment - recommended to those who like mysteries and also to those who just like good cinema.,1355875200,,181,5.066666666666666
8170485,3,B000MP2CK4,"The colorful animation sometimes almost achieves a proper moodiness in scenes that take place on the moor.  But even then the fog that lays heavy on the Grimpen Mire is colored too bright a blue.

The artwork is quite good, but the limited animation that was so often used in 1983 (Think of the classic animated Christmas specials of the time.) severely limits its appeal.

But the real culprit that holds back what might have been classic TV is the truly terrible sound recording.  The voices are all recorded in the same mind-numbing monotone and the over-done music is unrelentingly awful and of a volume that calls attention to itself, rather than punctuating the action on the screen.  Often, the music all but drowns out the flatly delivered dialogue.

Peter O'Toole's considerable talents are sadly wasted in this production.  You will find NONE of the fun verbal runs of logic in this presentation.  Holmes' lines are clipped and terse - and recorded in the same flat monotone that characterizes all the other dialogue.  I was VERY disappointed.  It was for O'Toole's performance that I bought this DVD.

All that said, the storyline does indeed touch on ALL the major plot elements that might be found in a contemporary live-action Hammer Film's telling of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"".  Not a kiddy version of the story - this program contains the kidnapping of the peasant girl for immoral purposes and all the deaths that are found in those worthy efforts.

This is very much like a Classic Comics version of the original novella.  As such, it might be a suitable introduction to the Sherlock Holmes story for a youngster who could never be induced to read a book. (The DVD disc also does double duty as a decoder ring for code enthusiasts.  That is actually kinda fun.)

This DVD would also be of interest for the Sherlock Holmes / Baskerville completist who wants to experience as many versions of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories as he can.

One can only wonder why the producers did not stick with the original title.",1315612800,4,2034,4.765714285714286
