8215046,4,B000OPW6E4,"This dvd is  so rare. I used to  have  this dvd but  an irresponsible co worker misplaced it so i had  to buy it again, only negative comment  i have about  this film is that actor Mike tan's voice was dubbed with a different  voice:( Maybe he sounds too 'ngo ngo' when talking specially in english wahhahah. Overall, jennylyn and rainier's tandem is hilarious  and makulit. Will denise end up with the guy she loved all her life or the guy who knew her all her life?:)",1358553600,,469,4.2988505747126435
