laughed a lot, was moved, and obviously felt identified with the

protagonist, director, factotum Moretti. But overall I felt this film

was a political disappointment. If he were truly a political man, he

could NEVER turn into musicals! Period.

Such a cleansed, ideologically perverse genre is incompatible with a)

political conscience b) brains.

OK, we don't always want to ""save the world"" or discuss hefty topics

(like French cinema), but I find musicals a distasteful, tacky

aesthetic option. That is why I felt so disappointed with Nanni.

I feel he has the potential to be a great director, a ""beacon"" of

intelligent but not haughty film-making. Like Woody Allen, for

instance. (I saw Caro Diario twice on cinemas, in spite of his long

""tempos"" at ""Islands""). Instead, he makes the jokes too long, overacts,

is outright stupid when coming up with nonsense while ""doing the

documentary"".

By the way, I'd LOVE a life in which ""shooting a

documentary"" were ""duty"". I wonder what ""pleasure"" would have to be :)!

The inclusion of his baby and family may serve his a purpose, but I

found it irrelevant at best.

Overall, I would like him to be the powerful director who could shoot this scene with the ship full of Albanians and piano music, touching without pounding a ""message"".

I'm afraid he would rather take the ""playful/ escapist"" way. It is very

common in people dedicated to ""the arts"" (even the most brilliant, like

Woody). But very frustrating to ""us, social scientists"".

Whichever our ""rank""!

Conclusion: ""If I could"", I would say to him THE SAME HE SAYS TO HIS

political CANDIDATES when facing Berlusconi on TV: ""React! Say

something!""

A musical will never tell any moving human story, nor be beautiful.

Allen makes a GREAT missile/ pun on them in ""Match Point"" (when the

silly wife loves them, and the couple goes just after he misbehave a

bit . He deems them SO irrelevant you only hear it for a second :).

THAT is intelligent cinema!",1156982400,2,2046,4.790229885057471
