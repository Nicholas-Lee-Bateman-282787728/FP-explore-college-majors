4237618,5,B00402FGI0,one of the best movies was weekend at bernie's laughed so hard the others were very good also miss  the 80's,1391817600,,108,4.142857142857143
4237619,4,B00402FGI0,"Clearly a classic for all time, Weekend at Bernie's is a gem I had forgotten about.  This leads the pack with undeniable hilarity and the fantasy of two regular joes trying to get rich.  The other movies are good, but Party Animal is creepily forgettable.  I didn't like that guy, the music was ok, but easily the lowest of the four.  Hot Dog: the movie is more cheese with some impressive Shannon Tweed footage, Meatballs 4 was the worst of the four IMHO.",1357516800,,456,4.457831325301205

8411591,5,B00402FGI0,"Let me say I would have given this box set a two star rating, if Hot Dog...the movie wasn't in this set. The good thing about this set, is that the Hot Dog movie is cheaper in this set than on it's own.",1499990400,,202,3.7209302325581395
