7967128,5,B00006CXGA,"WOW.

For any book to provide ""new"" facts, or insight, about Elvis Presley is quite the accomplishment and Elvis and June: A Love Story does just that.

This book pulls back the curtain to Elvis life offstage during a time when he was not only the most famous singer in the World but opened himself up to June in way that is both moving and passionate. They say that "" a picture is worth a thousand words"" and this book has many photographs that are wonderful to behold and are a ""snapshot in time"" when Elvis and June were (truly) in love.

I truly enjoyed this book and I am thankful that June opted to share her personal story about Elvis Presley.

7967129,5,B00006CXGA,"Only the archaelogist in us would be interested in the effect of fame, materialism and special treatment on early Elvis. We know how it ended and this wonderful home movie shows what Elvis had before his rise and fall. Gentleness, playfulness and a relaxed sweetness. Just seeing ""the King"" shooting BB guns with his buddies, doing what all of us did in our teen years and cozying up to his girl was very touching. Perhaps if his buddies could have shown him this early footage in his later life, he might have postponed his sad end. This time-capsule of innocent love and simple pleasures in the lazy 50's should be seen by any aspiring singer or Elvis admirer before reaching for the stars. When you recall his demise after viewing,you will be seriously moved.",1147305600,8,762,4.6940298507462686
7967130,5,B00006CXGA,"The color film and photos make a great compliment to June's book. It is very interesting hearing June tell the story  although ""In the Twilight of Memory"" contains more detail. It is also very interesting hearing Geroge Klein tell his story as well. I recommend reading the book and then watching this movie to see Elvis in the time before he was influenced by Hollywood and Col. Parker.",1095379200,5,387,4.6911764705882355
