8467777,3,B005DZ35SQ,Thought-provoking but too long & drawn out with too many blank stares & not enough dialogue to explain what was going on exactly...also the acting could have used work.,1488672000,,168,4.827586206896552
8467778,4,B005DZ35SQ,"The Sylvian Experiments is more creepy than it is terrifying, and it leaves a lot unexplained. However, it is an excellent foreign language J-Horror entry in the mother horror genre.

In particular, the film depicts destructive/creative fallout from maternal abandonment in an already devastated family. There is also plenty of Jungian madonna/goddess archetype imagery if you are into that stuff (I am - it is part of what I like about this kind of story). Color, especially red, is used to convey what the dialogue mostly does not (of course, I have no way to know how good the subtitles are), and while I have to admit to being confused here and there, for me, the film was profoundly affecting and deeply sad.

Well worth watching on a streaming subscription or other on demand service.",1483747200,2,790,4.844444444444444

8467780,5,B005DZ35SQ,Ignore the lpwer quality camera work at the beginning because this film is very powerful once it takes you through the story. It is a true original.,1435276800,,148,4.518518518518518
8467781,5,B005DZ35SQ,"Oh my , I loved this. Such and interesting plot. I just watched it again today. Arrive fast and well packaged",1426809600,2,109,4.238095238095238
8467782,5,B005DZ35SQ,A great movie! Creeped me out!,1424476800,2,30,4.166666666666667
8467783,2,B005DZ35SQ,Not even close to what I expected. I don't think the writer or director had any idea of who or what was suppose to be presenting itself to the case study patients. - - - Seems like no-one had a clue (including the viewers) what was really going on in this film .,1396051200,,262,3.9622641509433962
8467784,2,B005DZ35SQ,"Remember the good old days of J-Horror? When Japan was cranking out horror movie hits like The RIng, The Grudge and Infection. Well, the Sylvian Experiments tries to bring back those days. But, unfortunately, it fails. The pacing is too slow and there aren't really any genuine scares in this latest release from the land of the rising sun.",1323302400,2,340,4.779661016949152
8467785,1,B005DZ35SQ,"It looked like the storyline of this movie was going somewhere, but it's like the bridge to nowhere.  In addition, it does also get somewhat confusing.  Save your money for something else.",1318550400,,188,4.84375
