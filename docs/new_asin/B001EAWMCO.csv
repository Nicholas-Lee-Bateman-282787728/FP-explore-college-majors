3547642,5,B001EAWMCO,The title says it all!  His portrayal of Billy Ross has inspired the 10's of people that have seen this movie!,1224633600,,110,4.238095238095238
8297284,1,B001EAWMCO,"I gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero. I live in the area where this movie was filmed and takes place. The only thing that this movie has going for it us that it has a little more class than the city it represents. And they changed the name of the film, so that it is no longer stigmatized by the instant association with the Spirit Lake/ Okoboji area.",1431043200,,365,4.083333333333333
8297285,2,B001EAWMCO,Boring!!,1415836800,,8,8.0
8297286,1,B001EAWMCO,"It is not a well done film.  I only bought it because a lot of it was filmed in Okoboji, Iowa.  I live in the area and it was fun to see places I know.",1361145600,,151,3.2857142857142856
8297287,1,B001EAWMCO,"This movie is like a plot from a daytime soap opera that would be played out over a year and a half, here pieced together to form a feature-length film.  Like most soap opera plots, it's corny and ridiculous and has many holes, flaws, impossibilities, etc.  The acting is also horrendous as is the script, loaded with corny and laughably bad dialogue horribly delivered by the actors.  It does have potential to be a so bad it's good piece of entertainment, if you're in the mood for that.  Then again, it really is so bad that you may not even find it that good.",1301529600,,563,4.384615384615385
8297288,5,B001EAWMCO,"If you are a fan of bad movies this is one worth watching again and again. Right up there with the all time greats such as ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"". You can practically hear the MST3K crew cracking wise during the long and pointless pauses in the nonsense dialogue. Not since Manos itself has there been so many seemingly randomly inserted scenes where characters do inexplicable things seemingly unrelated to the main plot of the film... if there is one. Overall a masterpiece of bad film making from the photography (visuals are blurry and hard to see in at least half the scenes even though the film is on DVD format)to the script (oh god the script!) to the acting, location, and just plain logic choices (going to a baseball game outdoors at Christmas time in Minneapolis?). I literally laughed out loud when an unnamed character from the beginning of the film showed up and shot another character for no reason, then the main character was fine 5 minutes later. There was never any explanation offered, and likely there was none possible. Just another randomly inserted scene among many.",1300924800,2,1095,4.768421052631579
8297289,3,B001EAWMCO,"I visited Arnold's Park since I was very young.  The roller coaster was long and crickety - the best way to get a thrill!  I have to admit, I hunted down the film because it was set at Arnold's Park.  And, I'd watch it again to see... Arnold's Park.",1294617600,,249,4.040816326530612
8297290,4,B001EAWMCO,"I did not expect much from this movie, I bought it because I know the Okajobi Lake area and thought it would be nice to see the park again.  But I must say I really liked it a lot.

The two women in the movie, Jessica Stier and Maitland McConnell are just stunning beauties and very very good actors.  Tac Fitzgerald is a stud and also a great actor.

I am really good at guessing the end of a movie but this one had me guessing right to the end.

One more thing, the music by Shelter Belt was fantastic!  Who is this group I need to hear a lot more of them!!!",1252281600,,560,3.911504424778761
8297291,1,B001EAWMCO,"the film concerns the death of a young girl at an amusement park several
years previous to the start of the film and how it has haunted the nearby
town. the film begins with a young man and his uncle trying to revive the
park. it has got to be one of the most unevenly developed slowest paced
suspense thrillers i've ever seen. the only reason to buy the dvd are the
numerous shirtless scenes of star hottie Tag Fitzgerald.",1233878400,,423,4.3
8297292,3,B001EAWMCO,This movie is refreshing in a unique way.  If watched knowing it is not a major motion production but a low budget I think you'll appriciate the movie.  It keeps you guessing til the end.,1228435200,,187,4.314285714285714
8297293,5,B001EAWMCO,"Interesting, entertaining. It reminded me of movies from the 40's, when more emphasis was on the script and actors versus explosions. Nice twist at the end.",1225238400,,156,5.038461538461538
