706093,4,6303696813,"This movie is NOT supposed to be 100% realistic.  This is for the benefit of all you couch potato landlubbers out there.  But it is an AWESOME film about power, and moral conformity.  Silly details like the captain yelling  ""Hard to left!"" (instead of ""Hard to PORT!"") are not  enough to lesson this film's true value.  Buy it, see it, love it.",947635200,4,344,4.467741935483871

706095,1,6303696813,"I detest movies that put on a false air of profundity, pretending to be a lot deeper and more thoughtful than they really are. This movie is a prime example of that. The captain vs soldier confrontaion cliche has been done  many times before - and better too. Hackman vs Washington is a pale  imitation of the terrific Gable vs Lancaster confrontation of ""Run  Silent Run Deep"". I was extremely offended by a scene in the movie  which depicts Hackman letting his dog urinate on the sub. Perhaps, the  director thought this would add drama to the movie, and add further shades  of arrogance to Hackman's character. Instead, it exposes the movie for what  it is: a hyped-up farce which fritters away a believable and extremely  significant movie premise.",913852800,13,752,4.775193798449612

This is a very well made movie.  The acting is excellent, Denzel and Gene have a ball - and so do we. The  plot is good.  The production spot-on.

706207,4,6303696813,"I did enjoy this movie, however...being a USAF Veteran and not a Navy Veteran, I still found it highly unlikely and unrealistic. It definitely had it's cringe moments and anyone who talked to another officer like the Captain did in this movie would be in trouble in some way. Assaulting a fellow officer several times buy punching him in the face, going ahead with orders to fire nuclear missiles when a military message gets cut off from knowing the official outcome of said message is just not going to happen. There is strict military rules of law and code, no matter what rank you are.
Several of the officers that were involved in certain events would have their careers ended soon after. Many of the officers that were aboard went against their Navy laws and regulations in an armed ""coupe"" against the XO, just because they didn't like him when he came aboard? Utterly ridiculous.
The cast and music were great. I also enjoyed the action, but if you are looking for a movie that has realism in it that would portray our Navy, this is NOT the one.
This movie looks really good on the UHD TV. Whoever did the menu design did a great job.
There are Several Special Features on the Blu-ray, with some being carried over from the DVD Edition.",1517356800,,1244,4.558035714285714

It's not the fact that that would never occur, it's the fact that the CO character allowed the dog to piss on the deck without cleaning up after it. This display of Total Disrespect for the crew was maddening to me. That would never occur in the fleet. Leave it to Hollywood to mess up a decent flick.",1488153600,7,489,4.433333333333334

The message is cut off.  Hackman thinks the U.S. has been attacked and wants to launch.  Washington thinks they should wait until they get the rest of the message.  Washington pretty much leads a mutiny and takes over the sub.  Some of Hackmans's men remain loyal.  And put him back in control.  This is a intense, exciting movie.  I think it's probably compared a lot to Hunt For Red October.  I think this is the better movie.  The performances are good all the way around.  3.5 stars.",1485820800,,652,4.614035087719298

Brilliant screen writing there, boys... Capital job. Congratulate yourselves. You slipped the ""f"" word or some variation of it into the script some 28 times, with each shtick-filled scene delivered with suitably DEFCON-4 apoplexy & juvenile rage. The only thing missing on the faces of the cast were pimples, but perhaps the Navy issues Clearasil in cursing school. ""F"" this and ""f"" that...oughta win you a Pulitzer.

<Director: ""CUT!!! Who wrote this crap?"">

This could've been a great movie. Instead, it's not. The premise is good, but the dialogue is vintage illiterate 8th grade trash, and in its totality only achieves showing Navy officers and enlisted men as a bunch of foul-mouthed, hysterical, bordering on fanatical f*^#ing lunatics in charge of a significant number of nuclear weapons. We were rooting for the Russians in the Shchuka (i.e., the Akula class sub - now replaced by the far more advanced Severodvinsk) if only to end the ordeal and teach these punks some manners.

707512,5,6303696813,"This terrific film from 1995 features Denzel Washington in the earlier part of his acting career, cast as the second-in-command on a nuclear sub, pitted against Gene Hackman in the later part of his career but still acting with full power, in the role of the Commander of the sub.  Hackman first plays nice and then plays cat-and-mouse with his new XO through the first half of the film, until the gloves come off and there's a direct ongoing confrontation between the two that crackles with energy.

Directed with a sure hand by Tony Scott, who knows how to direct and pace an action/ suspense film, the film it doesn't seem the least dated even though it's 20 years old now.  Color and overall visual quality is quite strong, and the audio also holds up very well, again without seeming dated.

I am sure that dogs and fishtanks are not allowed on subs, but they added to the entertainment. Also thankfully, no decapitations or torture. Also, no sex. This is a film about wars of wills on the micro and macro levels, which shows filmmakers that great tension can be built without extreme violence. And one can see how James Gandofini got the roll as Tony Soprano- great malicious facial expressions, worthy of a prince or a mafia don.",1446508800,,571,4.72
707515,5,6303696813,"The film is packed with genuine 'tension' the world is on the brink of a nuclear holocaust,the sub's Captain 'Frank Ramsey' (Gene Hackman) is convinced the last order recieved gives authority for a devestating 'strike' ....but comunication is down, the number 'two' 'Lt Commander Ron Hunter' wants to wait for further communication which causes a serious split in the command chain.
Taking over the heavily armed vessel becomes the only option left for the number 'two' and those that feel the same way.
Both men have a point, but who's decision will turn out to be the right one ?
'Denzel Washington' and 'Gene Hackman' afford you some compelling viewing, this is such a good film, i've seen it several times before, but still wanted to watch it again on the 'Blu-ray' format,...........

707927,5,6303696813,"I don't think officer training school can adequately prepare someone for the no-win situation, which I believe is at the heart of ""Crimson Tide"". This film is not terribly complex in its storytelling but the theme of a decision-making dilemma aboard a nuclear submarine makes the entire experience extremely compelling from start-to-finish. It's one thing if orders from on high instruct a ship or sub to patrol a certain geographical location and those orders may have been recanted. It's quite another if the orders are to engage in a nuclear launch, and there is a question about whether those orders were rescinded. The story takes place on the USS Alabama, a United States nuclear submarine on the verge of a possible nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States. The title is a kind of play on words as it references the University of Alabama nickname, the Crimson Tide.

Gene Hackman is perfectly cast as the hot-headed/don't-question-my-orders Captain Ramsey, top commander of the USS Alabama. On the other side is Denzel Washington as Commander Hunter, Executive Officer (XO) of the sub and Harvard graduate who has probably memorized the officer's handbook and military code. Ramsey probably hasn't seen the handbook in years, his decision-making prowess derived from experience on the high seas which began when Washington was in kindergarten. Even early on, Washington and Hackman seem somewhat at odds in the officer's lounge when Washington states that ""war is the enemy"", while Hackman is bent on carrying out orders without question, and he expects his senior officers to give him the same courtesy. Hackman says during the same discussion that he studied military tactics, not 19th-century philosophy. The best line of the film is when Hackman states ""We're here to preserve democracy, not practice it.""

The two senior officers collide when at first the sub is given orders to launch their nuclear weapons toward Russia and then shortly thereafter receives a fragmented communication. The question posed is whether the initial communication should be honored and the fragment discarded or should the launch be delayed in order to obtain the second message in its entirety. But faulty communications prevents the sub from receiving further messages, and they are under attack from another enemy sub which knows their capabilities. The moral dilemma is as follows: If the nuclear weapons are launched and the order had been rescinded, the sub would be responsible for provoking World War III. If the orders to launch were confirmed by the second message, and the sub doesn't act, the United States would be compromised in terms of a nuclear exchange. The film becomes a power struggle between Washington and Hackman on the best course of action.

A really engrossing film with not only outstanding performances by the top leads but a great supporting cast to match, including James Gandolfini (of Sopranos fame) and Matt Craven (A Few Good Men) as supporters of the captain, and George Dzundza (No Way Out) as the Chief of the Boat who reluctantly supports Washington. Honorable mention goes to Viggo Mortensen who has the combination to the safe which contains the nuclear launch device but can't decide who he sides with. The main thrust of the story is interspersed with interesting dialog, some of which has nothing to do with the situation at hand, probably provided by Quentin Tarantino who is uncredited. A perfect combination of action and drama within the context of a military thriller.",1433808000,,3521,5.130662020905923

708048,5,6303696813,"Yes little ducks, that's a line from one of the opening shots of the movie when Gene Hackman who plays Captain Frank Ramsey of the USS ALABAMA nuclear missile sub is addressing the crew before they start their mission.  The mission is to set sail and be on the ready to launch their nuclear payload toward Russia if worse comes to worse and the rebel force that suddenly took control of several russian subs and a russian nuke base tries to launch their missiles against America.  This movie was released in 1995, had a 53 million dollar estimated budget and Tony Scott was the director.  Who the heck's Tony Scott?????  He was/is the brother of Ridley Scott who did a little space movie called Alien.  I say was because he's no longer with us (suicide, 2012).  Tony also did another fairly popular movie you might know called Top Gun, another military themed movie that made the American Navy and their fighter pilots look the badazzes that they are (again going up against the russians).  In this movie you have Denzel Washington playing Lt. Commander Ron Hunter the Alabama's new XO (executive officer) who's well educated but relatively inexperienced in actual combat as compared to Gene Hackman's character Captain Frank Ramsey the old school, self made, well seasoned boats commander who's seen it all done it all.  Another notable performance came from a little known actor who became America's favorite mobster hitman Tony Soprano was delivered by James Gandolfini (passed away in 2013, heart attack).  Viggo Mortensen plays Lt. Peter 'weps' Ince who is in charge of weapons launch/control.  He gets tugged between Denzel and Gene's characters as they fight each other for control.  Control goes back and fourth between the two with Ramsey being relieved of command by Hunter then Hunter being ousted by Ramsey.  It all boils down to the radio man vossler being able to fix the radio and get the vital EAM so they can find out if Ramsey was right and they should've launched or if Hunter was right and the launch called off.  The more I watch this movie the more interesting the story line actually becomes to me.  Think about it, you have the old captain hellbent on following his orders and launching his nukes and you have the younger officer saying wait a minute, we should check this out every way from sunday before we launch.  The principal actors all deliver good performances, some of the newbies are borderline so so but still in the tollerable range.  I wasn't left with a feeling of ""oh my lord why did I buy this PIECE OF CR*P"" .  Viggo went on to do the Lord of the Rings trilogy, his career has more or less been on a low simmer since then.  This dvd has captions, an on the set of clip and a making of featurette, no director commentary, the blu-ray is crisp and clean and will provide nice viewing and if you don't like my review please keep it to yourself cause I have a fragile ego.  So little ducks my advice to you is get this movie and a big greasy tub of popcorn, plop down in front of the seventy inch widescreen and let Gene and Denzel take you into the amazing, fantastic world of underwater politics on a nuclear sub.",1428624000,8,3152,4.5964285714285715

Two very different officers with different approaches are on display here, and a story that could prompt discussion is given a conclusion that kills it.  The writers even throw in some animal cruelty to make sure you get the message and take the side you're supposed to take.  Though I get tired of foreign films that treat ambiguity and inconclusiveness as virtues, I have to say that a story like this one would have been better off in non-Hollywood hands.

708785,2,6303696813,"Hollywood Pictures should sell the distribution rights to Warner or Universal so we can get a decent Anamorphic transfer.

This is a title, along with many Paramount and other titles that desparitely need Anamorphic transfers. A modern HDMI DVD upscaler is not compatible with non-anamorphic titles. Non-anamorphic titles contort the screen to the point where black bars fill 80% of the screen, leaving only a small, unviewable slit to which the Movie shows. Miramax chose to give rights to Echo Bridge, which distributes the films in 6/8/10 packs with less than stellar quality, almost VHS quality. It makes your brand look bad, Miramax.

It's not hard to do, a simple transfer of the HD copy to DVD without any enhancements and at a high 8500 bit rate would provide a very high quality viewing experience (on an HDMI DVD Upscaler) that rivals even Sony's Superbit DVDs. Even a home viewer could do it with an HD copy of the Film and a program like DeVeDe (Linux). It's dead simple and would cost them (Paramount etc) pennies to do. It would also rival the quality of modern DVD quality. I know this since we've done it with local production companies for their publications, legally of course with their material and for their distribution.

It's 2014 , more than 70% of the movie watching peoples still choose to do so on DVD. Blu-ray is too consumer unfriendly and has failed to catch hold after 9 years with it's strict DRM and Internet requirements. I might add that various Virus and Malware have been reported to be infecting these Blu-ray players so it's only a matter of time before that format implodes. Digital downloads are the next likely choice, except you don't actually own the movie you pay for and it could disappear at any time.

It's a common theme ... chain of command setting, idealogue vs man of action . Also a classic power struggle. The reason I did not give it 45 stars is simply because it had too much of a Star Trek ""I only have 5 minutes to fix this and I'll do it in 4 minutes and 59 seconds"" feel to it. Hey I love Star Trek and this movie did have great suspense, but it was bordering on sci fi caliber. This was supposed to be a plausible situation. That said, it's an exciting movie with alot of good actors and believable action. I recommend it.

Submarines are ""boats,"" not ""ships."" Both Captain Hackman and Lt. Commander Washington refer to the ""ship"" at various points in the movie and more than once. This is totally inauthentic and was quite noticeable. The submariner reviewers pointed to other mistakes: the stock video of an attack submarine was used to represent the ballistic missile sub USS Alabama underwater (I easily recognized this as a mistake), the galley grease fire not automatically extinguished and then a weapons drill started before the fire was contained, the captain allowing his dog to urinate on a deck, the supply officer was allowed to serve in the control room, and most conspicuously the captain was arrogant, overbearing, easy to anger, did not take the time to reconsider the missile launch communication problem, and threatened an enlisted man with death by holding a gun to his head to force the weapons officer to remove the launch key! Submarine captains are just better than this. Of course, this is a movie and the plot is contrived to create drama. Perhaps that is all the producers cared about.

709128,3,6303696813,"A beloved teacher of English Literature, himself a successful novelist, instructed me 50 years ago as follows: Let character drive the action.  Over-rely on chance events, and your audience will perceive gimmicks propping up your plot.

Indeed, I enjoy a good action film loaded with spectacular effects and cheap thrills.  Hollywood understands this formula for market success.  But here, the story and film dramatization had the seeds for something greater.  Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman were equal to the challenge.  The chaos of a world teetering on the edge of war could provide killer subs credibly firing on the protagonist's ship, and so on.  A narrow escape or two is OK.  But in rapid succession, a first, second and third hair's breadth escape, with the improbability of actual survival rising, and still forty minutes left in the film???  You start to experience the predictable formula: Casualties are allowed, but the protagonists WILL survive to finish the film.  What fails to survive is the drama.

The excesses of narrow escape are worsened when Planet Earth is once again on the line.  War Games (1983 version) introduced us to the nuclear missile version of this genre.  Independence Day.  The Sum of All Fears.  How about Space Cowboys?  The list goes on ...  But one thing in favor of this Almost Planet-Killer:  By THE FORMULA, the global threat supports the Real Drama: salvation of the protagonist's kith and kin.  Space Cowboys: A Planet-Killer asteroid is deflected so that the hero can marry his sweetheart.  The Day After Tomorrow: the freezing death of billions is a backdrop to our joy over the survival of the protagonist's family.  At least this drama focused our emotions on a credible planetary threat.  It did not lean on our Darwinian instincts for survival of tribe and offspring.  It challenged us with a concern for survival of the planet that supports all tribes and all offspring.  We need more of that.",1365811200,,1951,4.987577639751553

talent of these two gifted actors who portray naval officers, in a life threatening situation.
No communication from the outside and they hold the fate of the world with their decision.
I'm sure no one would ever want this responsibility. Yet these actors and cast
present a dramatic portrayal of people caught in this dilemma. To me, this movie is an opportunity to watch acting at it's best.

709200,5,6303696813,"While I have this exciting film on Standard Def, this is a review of the Blu Ray transfer only.  So many people provide plot summaries and opinions on acting and accuracy, I only review the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray itself.

The video transfer is what all transfers should be.  It is excellent in every way with strong contrast and spot on colorizations.  Skin tones are very realistic and there is no noticeable grain, nor artifacts or aliasing of any kind that I can see.  I don't say that too many transfers to Blu Ray are DEMO quality but Crimson Tide on Blu Ray definitely is and would be an excellent choice to add to your collection.

I often focus more on the audio than video, but the video on this BluRay is only rivaled by the superb audio and not beaten by it.  The lossless audio, DD PCM 5.1 is perfect.  Its levels are nicely set and the disc will make full use of your surround system.  There is a good amount of panning between channels and excellent use of the discreet channels for appropriate directionality from both the front and rear audio stages. Nice foley fx from all channels a great many times.  There is lots of opportunity on the DVD to put your LFE sub channel to work as well.  The audio, is also most DEMO worthy.

There were a great many extras including all extras on the Standard Def version.  I have not taken the time to look at them yet however.

All in all, I found no fault with this disc other than too many previews(advertisements) for other films.  It is a great one to have and if you have the Standard Def DVD version, a good one to upgrade.  A great Blu Ray to show off your home theater system with.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

After all we're talking about nuclear destruction if the orders were bad or rescinded!

One wonders if the show would have been as great with two lesser actors.  Great flick. The tension is thick! The acting is great. The subplot tension between the two top officers is overwhelming.  You keep saying to yourself, ""Hey, you guys are on the same side.""

Aside from this, there are moments where reality wanes.  For instance, the Captain would be court marshaled for threatening to execute an officer while pointing a gun, point blank at his head.

An international confrontation causes the military and the world to go onto alert.  A revolt in Russia leads to missiles being aimed at the USA and Japan as a blackmail attempt to stop the conflict within Russia and to prevent intervention from outside sources.  The submarine USS Alabama is sent to patrol the waters off of the area in conflict and they are there to make sure that the missiles do not launch under any circumstances.

The boat's Captain is Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and he has to find a new XO who is Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) as his present XO is ill with appendicitis. The Russians have been seen fueling the nuclear missiles to prepare them for launching.  The sub receives notice to attack and before they can receive the entire message they are attacked by a Russian sub and they lose radio contact.....

This is an intense film regarding an over domineering Captain and a younger and less experienced XO who are in conflict with each other over what their orders might really be.  The crew is split into a mutinous situation and a lot of action and anger is released over who is in charge and what to do and who to follow.  This is an all-star cast with many stars and a great storyline.  The only downside for me is promoting the belief that something like this could really happen on an American submarine.

709367,4,6303696813,"I enjoy going back to this movie on a regular basis for more viewings; it's that good. In fact, ""Crimson Tide"" has to rank as one of the greatest submarine movies ever, in company with ""Das Boot,"" ""The Enemy Below,"" ""The Hunt for Red October"" and the sadly underrated ""K-19: The Widowmaker.""

I've knocked off a star because I'm a submarine fanatic and know there are some inaccuracies here. For more on that subject, read the review here tagged as being written by a ""real submariner."" He makes some valid points that potential viewers might want to consider in deciding whether to see the film. None of the innacuracies bothered me very much, but they are there.

Basically, though, I have to say that the great performances and tight direction win the day. Gene Hackman, Denzel Washington, Viggo Mortensen and George Dzundza as, respectively, the captain, executive officer, weapons officer and chief of the boat are no less than spectacular, and the supporting cast is excellent as well. The late Tony Scott directed, and while he's probably best-known for ""Top Gun,"" I think ""Crimson Tide"" and ""True Romance"" are his best films.

The situation set up by the script is enough to put anyone on the edge of his or her seat: In post-Soviet Russia, a possible coup is in progress, and rebels may or may not be successful in fueling land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. If they do, they could fire them at the United States.

The USS Alabama, an Ohio-class SSBN, or ballistic missile submarine, is sent to sea along with other ""boomers"" placed on alert during the crisis (SSBN stands for ""ship, submersible, ballistic, nuclear"".) Unfortunately, the boat's XO has come down with appendicitis, so Capt. Frank Ramsey (Hackman) must choose a replacement: Ron Hunter (Washington), a lieutenant commander with more theoretical knowledge than combat experience.

The Alabama receives orders to launch its nuclear missiles. Minutes later, a second message begins to come in -- but is cut off during a time of confusion, as the Alabama is being attacked by a Russian sub. Hunter argues that the Alabama should try to re-establish radio contact to see if the second order countermanded the first. Ramsey disagrees, saying that the second message is not a legitimate message at all but only a ""message fragment."" He feels the Alabama must waste no time in striking at the Russian rebels. Hunter refuses to concur -- and states that, according to the rules under which SSBNs operate, the Alabama cannot launch unless he agrees with the Captain. After an angry confrontation, Hunter orders the chief of the boat (Dzundza) to arrest Capt. Ramsey and confine him to his quarters.

The story ratchets up from there, in a sequence of events so tense and gripping that it's impossible to lose focus. Supporters of Ramsey try to come to his aid, even as Hunter's supporters seek to slow everything down till the Alabama can fix its communications gear and receive the rest of the ""message fragment.""

""Crimson Tide"" is a relentless thriller. One last observation: The special effects are terrific -- much better than those achieved earlier by ""The Hunt for Red October.""",1345766400,,3161,4.9640831758034025

709369,5,6303696813,"My bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Crimson Tide"" starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. Good movie. Well done! It was something that could have come right out of the Cold War, but this was in the 90s. The story involved a nuclear-armed U S submarine (the Alabama) operating in the north-central Pacific. A renegade Russian general, involved in a civil-war conflict threatened to launch nuclear warheads toward the U S and the American sub was there as a possible counter attack. The timing of everything was crucial.

The American sub was under order to file it's warheads at a precise time, unless otherwise directed and the skipper (Gene Hackman) was not one to question orders. However, in the meantime, the U S sub had an encounter with a Russian sub and was damaged to the point where they could neither send nor receive further orders. The last available order was that the warheads were to be launched and that set up an internal conflict within the sub resulting in the overthrowing of the skipper (Hackman) by the second officer (Washington) and some regarded this as a mutiny and it set up a second mutiny, all within the confines of a damaged and sinking submarine. Well, It was a suspenseful and dramatic story, to be sure, and might result in a catastrophic nuclear conflict and World War III in the balance.

It was a good tense movie and the acting was excellent. Believe me, One felt as if they might be on that sub. Personally, I felt that it was the best acting I've ever seen for Gene Hackman. Washington was excellent also, but was not as believable as Hackman. The rest of the cast was excellent, as was the directing. Five stars!

Second in Command Denzel Washington and Captain Hackman have different conflicting philosophies that must be resolved while contending with a highly-charged, and ambiguous environment.

People have to stay in shape.  Not only do you have to pass a physical test every 6 months(doesn't seem like much), but you can't be obese either.

Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so.

It's too hard to believe the mutiny.

The weapons drill after the fire was unbelievable.  A fire on a ship is too dangerous and unpredictable to have crew be doing any other major event at the same time or even shortly after. The captain would have to KNOW the fire event is completely resolved before doing something else with the crew.

Besically this movie requires you to believe that a person has come through the ranks and is near the top of their game while ignoring common sense.

One thing that came to mind - and this occurred to me MUCH later after thinking about the events in the movie - is that would the U.S. really launch a nuclear strike from a submarine in a scenario such as depicted here? Seems like a carrier airstrike with F-18's dropping conventional bombs would be enough to wipe out the rebel missiles without risking WW3.

2/08: Big, bad Denzel Washington goes against big, bad Gene Hackman in Crimson Tide.

That's the fun part about the film.

Although Crimson Tide is a pretty good submarine picture to relax with, it isn't great enough to join the ranks of Das Boot and The Hunt for the Red October.

The acting by the two principal leads, Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, is not that bad at all. Surprisingly, Viggo Mortensen helps out and does relatively well.

The tension between the main characters has kept me gripped, allowing me to overcome the sluggish start which would last for 45 minutes.

I sort of like the ending, even though it's a surprise and a sharp 180 degrees at that.

What I mean by that last part, usually villains would be overcome with egoism and must have it all, but not this time with Gene Hackman's, admitting that he was wrong and took it like a man.

SPOILER ALERT for those who haven't seen the movie yet:

``Crimson Tide'' deals with a clash of egos and wills between a U.S. Navy submarine captain played by Gene Hackman and a young executive officer, or XO, played by Denzel Washington, who are brought together aboard the missile submarine ``Alabama''. The Alabama is deployed in secret to the Pacific to attack as a pre-emptive strike option should the Russian extremist Radchenko attempt to carry through with his threat to launch nuclear missiles at the U.S.
Hackman and Washington's characters stage mutinies and counter-mutinies to gain control of the Alabama before it can go through with the authorized launch of nuclear missiles.
Washington's character, Mr. Hunter, is convinced that the nuclear launch order was countermanded, but the transmission was cut off during an attack by a Russian submarine. Hackman's character, Captain Ramsey, believes otherwise and the senior officers are split on who's right. The movie comes across as a pretty believable thriller about nuclear brinkmanship and mutiny aboard a U.S. nuclear submarine.

709518,5,6303696813,"AND YOU THINK JAWS WAS SCARY?

Try Crimson Tide for an edge of your seat movie that will leave you thinking in spite of the Navy disclaimer at the end (which I didn't believe for a second).

Everything about this movie was perfect: the acting, script, score, direction, photography; and, of course, the plot.

As usual Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington turn in fantastic performances, but so do the strong cast of co-stars who supplement the main characters.

The plot as well as the acting is extremely believable in this tale of a submarine deployed due to a recent rebellion in Russia resulting in the capture of a Russian Missile Base by the rebels.

Hackman, who plays a veteran captain with battle experience, goes by the rule book; while Washington, as executive officer, is more educated, has a family, and the kind of mind that searches for every possible alternative before pushing the fatal button that will start a nuclear war.

Although their ship, The Alabama, receives a communication ordering them to launch their weapons, as they are winding up their missiles a second message comes in but is cut off in the middle of transmission.  A number of mishaps follow which damages their radio leaving them unable to retrieve the rest of the message.

The sub and its crew face the dilemma of division.  Hackman wants to launch immediately according to orders while Washington wants to wait until communications are re established realizing that the end of the second message might well be orders to abort the launch.  The viewer is caught up in the drama because each side has a compelling argument, leaving each one of us wondering just what we would do were we in a similar situation with millions of lives hanging in the balance.

This is a well done scary movie and the Navy disclaimer at the end somehow does not ring true.  Perhaps there is a type of fail proof system that provides a 100% guarantee that communications can not possibly be cut off even under the worst of circumstances, but I am not aware of any man made system no matter how carefully planned, that doesn't have the potential to malfunction.  Considering that the main bulk of today's nuclear weapons are  under the surface of our oceans,  and considering the number of ideologically driven nuts that may have their hands on the bottons, this movie should be taken seriously and provide food for thought about the direction in which mankind is traveling.

(USA - 1995)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

At the height of the Cold War, a battle of wills erupts between the captain of a US nuclear submarine (Gene Hackman) and his second-in-command (Denzel Washington).

Unusual blockbuster from the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer stable, which foregoes flashy set-pieces for an intimate - though no less gripping - drama involving two experienced submarine officers who lock horns over protocol as the world teeters precariously on the brink of nuclear war. Hackman embraces the 'shoot-first-ask-questions-later' point of view, while Washington prefers adherence to the rule-book, and both men are determined to prevail. Michael Schiffer's screenplay contains echoes of THE CAINE MUTINY, especially the dramatic sequence in which Washington is forced to assume command of the sub, though Hackman's subsequent attempt to regain control is pure melodrama, done to a turn.

Performances are first-rate all the way down the line, helped by gleaming production values and terrific dialogue (pop-culture references to ""Star Trek"" and the Silver Surfer betray evidence of an uncredited script polish by Quentin Tarantino), and director Tony Scott keeps a steady hand on the rudder. Also starring George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini, Danny Nucci, Rick Schroder, Steve Zahn and an unbilled Jason Robards. Look quickly for Ryan Phillippe as a young crewmember.",1254960000,,1458,5.700460829493087

Denzel Washington's character takes a difficult stand based on a clearer head considering the effects of what the captain proposes.  There is a delineation of loyalties between the crew, forced to take sides.  One old friend has to make a most difficult choice, and his hesitation itself saves the day in the end.  Highly suspenseful, extremely realistic, and with an end that is almost satisfying, though colored by centuries of tradition.  Fine performances by at least a dozen actors, including some who often get roles less important to the suspense.  The story shows how important the efforts of all members of the crew are to safety and mission accomplishment.  Heroism comes from staying on a hopeless task, from going against personal feelings, from recognizing when right is more important than power.  Everyone should see this film.",1235779200,,992,5.15

709675,3,6303696813,"I rented a VHS of this film a few years ago, and my review is based upon that viewing of Crimson Tide.

Having served in the Navy for two years at COMSUBPAC Staff in the early 1970s along with officers and enlisted submarine sailors, I fully respect the thoughts and comments made on this page about Crimson Tide by submarine veterans.  And they are right - the public needs to understand that what is portrayed in this movie would not really happen aboard a boomer [U.S. Ballistic Missile Submarine] if the reception of missile launch orders is intrerrupted in real life.

Unlike another reviewer on this page who felt that these submarine veterans should ""get off their high horse"" and wondered what really goes on down in the deep if they don't like the inaccuracy of this movie and ""whine about it like a sissy"", I will only tactfully say that all people who view this film, be they veterans who have been there - done that, or be they civilians who have no knowledge of the life of a ballistic missile submariner, or the strict regulations and code by which these boomer submariners live, that all should keep in mind - this is only a movie.  It's purely a fiction made only for entertainment, and not a documentary intended for the dispersal of truth.

Having said that, I also think that Hollywood needs to seriously review it's way of looking at our brave men and women in the armed forces, even if their product is meant for entertainment, and not for fact.

If you are looking for a film to accurately portray what would really happen on a boomer if it received incomplete radio orders regarding a missile launch, then don't look to Crimson Tide for the truth.

If you are looking for an entertaining story of conflict between strict obedience of orders and the responsibility of reason, then Crimson Tide is a film you want to see.

Somebody else wrote that ""The Hunt For Red October"" is a ""thinking man's action film"", and it is.

In a very different way, so is Crimson Tide.

Whether you feel this movie is good or bad, is up to you, really.

Captain Ramsey [Gene Hackman] is the captain of the USS ALABAMA, a real-life ballistic missile submarine.  His new Executive officer is Commander Hunter [Denzel Washington].  After a former Soviet Republic has fallen under control of a despotic dictator, and gained access to formerly Soviet ballistic missiles, and threatened to launch them against the United States, the ALABAMA is sent to patrol the waters surrounding that country.

While on patrol near this Soviet Republic, the  ALABAMA receives an authenticated order to launch missiles, followed by a second order that gets cut off when the ALABAMA is attacked by a Soviet attack submarine.

Captain Ramsey believes it is his duty - and Commmander Turner's - to simply obey the first message, and launch the missiles NOW!  Commander Turner believes it is his duty - and Captain Ramsey's - to resume radio contact with the Chain of Command BEFORE taking any further action.

That conflict sets up the drama - and the action - throughout the film.

What would YOU do?

Thought-provoking, and entertaining.

And much of what is portrayed in the film is very different from what it would be like on a real boomer.

Submarine Veterans have posted thier comments here, critical of the film's accuracy, and with good reason.  They have been on those missile boats, and the producers and writers of this movie have not.  That's the way it is, folks.

The Submarine veterans whom I was fortunate to serve with - and under - at COMSUBPAC were, to a man, fully professional sailors, all.  They are men of their word.  So when boomer sailors weigh in here to compare this movie with how these circumstances would really be answered on a sub in real life, you can rest assured that they're telling it like it is.

Listen to them.

I recommend this movie only with the caveat that the viewer be fully aware that Crimson Tide is only a well-written fiction, and nothing like what really happens - or would happen - aboard the Navy's ballistic missile submarines.

Listen carefully to what the Submarine Veterans have to say about this movie.  Read their comments about it on this page.

Then - Enjoy the movie with your eyes open.",1203206400,9,4229,4.672972972972973
709676,5,6303696813,"Blu-Ray has been releasing some great looking titles as of late. Sure there were exceptions last year. Even a few uneventful releases this year too. But, this title is sure to please. First off, I viewed this movie on my 40"" Sony XBR4 LCD. Calibrated with the Digital Video Essentials disk. Using Monster HDMI cables. Audio was through a Sony 910, 7.1 receiver. Speakers were Bose Acoustamass 16 series 2. I used a Sony PS3 for playback. So with that said, this is a great flick. Very good cast. Hackman and Denzel play a great goodguy vs badguy. Or should I say old school vs new school. Hackman is the old guard. Denzel is the new guy. Tons of action. Just as you would expect from director Tony Scott. He also directed Top Gun, True Romance, Enemy of the State, Man on Fire, and Day's of Thunder to name a few. So if you like his action adventure style. This will surely please.

The picture is Very, Very clean. No visible dirt, scratches, blemeshis. No edge enhancement of note. It truely appears to be reference quality. Details are very sharp. This is a dark movie. Shot entirely under water. The blacks are very, very black and true. There is not much color in this movie to talk about. Submarine movies are not a tropical paradise. But a beautiful film none the less.

Next is the sound. Very clear voices. Clean through and through. Battle scenes have great base. Once again, reference quality. Your subwoofer will hit hard several times. No crackling at all.

709677,5,6303696813,"...even without gratuitous sex and graphic violence. It has been almost 12 years since I first saw this movie, and I can still watch it today with great interest. The acting is superb, the dialogue convincing, and the plot intriguing. Director Tony Scott sets up the antagonism/contrast between the two main characters from the beginning. And each subsequent scene advances the building conflict until it reaches a boiling point when they disagree on how to handle an incomplete communique. Washington and Hackman give Oscar-worthy performances as Executive Officer and Captain. One of the most believable performances I have ever seen in a movie occurs just before the Captain is first relieved from duty. The movie is worth buying just to witness this confrontation!

And the co-stars are no acting slouches either. Stellar performances are given by James Gadofini (sp?), Matt Craven, George Dzundza, Viggo Mortensen, Rocky Carroll and Danny Nucci. There are not many movies my husband and I agree on -- he likes action and violence while I like action but not 'graphic' violence -- but Crimson Tide is one that we have both enjoyed over the years.",1192838400,,1150,5.084656084656085

709713,5,6303696813,"After the 80's unthinking testosterone action movies, the 90's marked a real change in action ouput, even from the Bruckheimer / Simpson producing team - and so came about this unusually intelligent war movie.
Following in the tradition of classic submarine movies like `The Hunt for Red Octobe' or `Das Boot', there are all the traditional action notes you would expect - torpedo attack, flooding compartments, sinking towards crush depth etc., all done with the technical and editorial perfection you would expect from Tony `Top Gun' Scott.  However, all the action is merely a backdrop for a real character study and moral dilemna.
Hackman's veteran Captain is of the old school, `I like things simple' approach.  When unrest in Russia becomes critical enough for them to receive orders to launch their nuclear payload, he sets out to perform his duty.  However, a second message is received - and it is incomplete, therefore can not be verified.  The radio goes down, and the sub is now out of touch with the rest of the world.  The `new school' Executive Officer played by Denzel Washington feels strongly enough that they should not follow through with the launch until the message is verified, leading him into direct conflict with the Captain and a tense, riveting and exciting showdown ensues.
The action is note perfect, but it is the acting that makes the movie stand out.  Seeing Washington and Hackman `mano-a-mano', cannot fail to knock your socks off with its intensity.  Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including a pre-Lord of the Rings Viggo Mortensen, and an excellent George Dzundza playing `Chief of the Boat'.
One early scene encapsulates all that is good about the movie - in the officers mess, a philosophical debate occurs around the launching of the atomic bomb on Japan.  Hackman defends the bombing, but Washington at the end of a verbal cat and mouse interplay, replies that `In the age of nuclear weapons, the true enemy is war itself.  It is this conflict of ideas that haunts the movie, and the viewer, long after the movie is over.  There are no out and out bad guys - just two principled men with different world views -surely there can be no greater drama.
The extended cut offers no substantial difference to the original, and seems to have little reason for existing.  The scenes reinstated are almost all minor character moments, giving the minor characters in the movie more time to shine, and helping consolidate the feeling of camaraderie in the submarine, which makes the eventual schism that much more shattering.  Other than that, there is a small documentary about the movie which is more promotional than educational.  If you have not seen the movie, do so immediately.  If you have seen it, and wonder if the extended cut is worth getting? I say don't waste your time.",1187913600,6,2834,4.877083333333333

709773,3,6303696813,"I gave this movie 3 stars because ultimately, I was entertained.  The acting (for the most part) was outstanding, and the tension that was created could be cut with a Knife.

That being said, Let me put some peoples mind at ease, and relate some of the inaccuracies of the movie.

1.  No Animals on Board.  Period.  Lose the Dog and the Fish Tank.  An aquarium would be a terrible missile hazzard, and a dog crapping and pissing onboard, not a chance.

2.  The supply officer (James Gandolfini) would never be allowed near control.  Nor would he have the ability to force a seaman or petty officer to do push ups onboard a bus.  The Supply Officer is a ""restricted"" officer, which means they can not participate in ""command"" of the vessel.  The ""Chop"" would simply be in charge of the ships stores and the galley, nothing else.

3.  There is no countermanding a launch command.  Period.  If the CIC (The Prez) issues a launch, the birds are flown.  All the fail-safe measures (authenticating the flash traffic) are pretty much spot on, yet when word comes down to launch, you launch.  The Navy asks it's young submariners to be prepared to do the unthinkable, and are trained as such.  As long as there exists the slight possibility that a valid order may be later recinded, you take away the confidence of the crew in it's orders.  The safe guards regarding authorization and two person concurrance is designed to prevent a single officer from launching weapons.

However, once a properly formatted, and authentic order is received, it is expected that it will be carried out.  To do otherwise would always give crew members a moment of pause, wondering when the order to stand down would occur.  This hesitation can not exist. Thus once the birds are ordered to fly, they will fly, as certain as if the president had pulled the trigger himself.

4.  While some submariners have been on the heavy side, the number of obese people seen on the boat is not consistant with a real crew.  And I have never seen ANYONE as obese as the COB was in this movie.

5.  There are no secret ""crawl spaces"" in which people can move around in.  The boat is not that big.  Thus, Hunter and crew would have had to navigate actual passageways to get to control, and would have run into whatever guards were stationed.

6.  The ""submarine"" diving in the exterior shots was not a trident ballistic missile boat, but rather a Los Angeles Class attack boat out of Hawaii.  I was in Pearl Harbor when the filming took place, and Pearl is strictly a Fast Attack sub base, with Tridents only coming once in awhile for a stop over after the end of a patrol.  The boat shown in the dive footage was actually an LA attack boat, and not a boomer.

7.  While boat commanders frequently run multiple casualty drills, there would never be a ""weapons drill"" run just after a potentially fatal fire.  The boat commander is ultimately responsible for the boat, crew, and it's payload.  No commander would brush off such a large conflageration and ""run a drill"" until the fire had been fully extinguished and the reflash watch reported no possibility of reflash existed.

8.  Enlisted Submariners by nature are picked for their maturity and intelligence.  Submariners, especially Nuclear Trained, are encouraged to ""question"" orders.  The safety of the boat and the crew depends on each person being able to accurately determine if an order given is ""lawful"".  The ""boys"" on board Alabama showed none of those traits.  The fact that the ""chop"" could bully his way into the Captain's Quarters by simply yelling is a testament to the poor opinion the film makers had of enlisted men.

In a ""real"" boat, the ""chop"" would have been staring down the barrel of a .45 caliber handgun, and would have been wrestled to the deck while a ""security violation"" was reported over the ship and ""away the security alert team"" was sounded.  Security on board a sub is so crucial, that there is a story in which a seaman actually ordered Admiral Rickover to kiss the deck face down because the admiral while wearing full dress whites, refused to show the deck watch his military ID.  He was spot promoted to Petty Officer by Rickover himself.

So while my Sailor side has issues with all the inaccuracies and fairly poor treatment the military gets with this movie, I do find the movie suspensful, entertaining, and sometimes too close to comfort (the flooding sequence is a nightmare all sailors share)

So kudos to the film makers for making a slick, taunt, thriller, but thankfully, that would and could NEVER happen.",1150416000,268,4566,4.675879396984925

709775,4,6303696813,"The original DVD release of Crimson Tide occurred at a time before the trends of including cut scenes, commentary, and animated menus.  While it makes sense to re-release the film with what we now considered the standard features, missing from the original, I found the overall experience somewhat disappointing.

For die-hard fans of Crimson Tide, this DVD is worth getting just to see the 7 minutes or so (Original release was 116 minutes, this version is supposed to be 123) of exra footage.  The title menu is much nicer than before, and the addition of the documentary is a great bonus.  But under deleted scenes, we're shown only three very short ""scenes"": an extra line of dialogue onboard the crew bus, a longer version of Radchenko's speech to the reporter, and a half-minute long nearly silent waiting scene before the panel at the end of the movie.  All three are shown as raw footage, without any cleaning, or explanation.

All of the content in the deleted scenes is in the primary feature, in a cleaned-up and nearly seamless state.  None of the new footage is more than a few seconds in length, but it's clear that all of it consists of short pieces of dialogue removed either for time constraints or clarity.  What this means is that throughout the movie we're treated to bursts of extraneous dialogue that the editor had originally removed, usually for a reason.  It's interesting from the point of view of a film student, but as a consumer release I think it degrades from the experience ever so slightly.  Crimson Tide is all about suspense, and anything that distracts the focus of the audience is consequently lowering the quality of the movie.  None of it is very overt, but there's enough of it that it might harm the experience of a first-time viewer of the film.

Overall, the extras contained in this release make it a must-have for previous fans, but for new buyers I would still recommend the original DVD cut.",1147824000,108,1938,4.7351190476190474
709776,5,6303696813,"One wonders how much more you can push from actors like Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington, but when surrounded but an absolutely STELLAR supporting cast as in this new classic submarine movie, you expect more, and you GET it.

The plot is of course well thrashed over and I will recommend the extended version for those who don't own it--but also for those who DO own it, like sub flicks, and won't wan't to miss a pixel.  It is worth the extra just for that, and to have a loaner copy.

Submarine combat (or near-combat) films are a genre unto themselves, and this rates in the top ten easily.  For war and action thriller buffs--you have to like your action psychological, because that is what is presented here.  It is more than ""the new Navy"" versus the old ""blood and guts Navy"" but actually a film whose backdrop is the classic ""On War"" by von Clausewitz, a 19th century Prussian military theorist who, I am sorry for you ""Art of War"" fans, puts, Sun Tsu to shame for depth of thought about the use of armed forces.

To my knowledge, this is the ONLY major action/war thriller to mention von Clausewitz, so if this alone leads to to find a copy of his work, it is well worth the trip to Amazon or your local bookstore, if you're lucky.

I won't drop Denzel's captivating line about the nature of war, but even in isolation, that clip makes the movie.  Whether we reach armegeddon is, really, kind of beside the point--isn't it?  Especially in a film in which Richard Valeriani of CNN plays himself in an effort to drum up real-life drama.  We had enough real-life drama when the Clinton administration bombed the last defense of Europe against the Asian hordes in Sarajevo.  Wait a minute--that wasn't PC, was it?  And, neither is Captain Ramsey with his Jack Russell non-governmental issue terrier, but you'll love him anyway.

709777,5,6303696813,"CRIMSON TIDE is one of the ultimate thrillers about the clash over who's right and who's wrong, with Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington delivering Oscar-caliber performances. In this brand new unrated and extended version, you get never before seen footage (most of which just adds depth and dimension to an already stellar movie). Plus you get an excellent supporting cast, including Sopranos' James Gandolfini in an early role.

The movie follows the story of two officers on the USS Alabama, a submarine sent to the Atlantic to keep an eye on Russian submarines threatening to launch nuclear devices against the US. One of these officers, a strict and headstrong captain, is committed to following everything by the book and making the big decisions. The other, an executive office also very by-the-book and brilliant minded, is there to oversee that his orders are followed. However, when a fax transmission to the submarine is cut off, a clash begins over what might be the next move. Captain Ramsey belives that the government has condoned the use of nuclear weapons, but his other officer, Commander Hunter, believes that the government has sent a very different message. This leads to a split over who may have the upper hand, and tensions escalate to the boiling point.

The movie features very real tension, every moment that someone is  ready to snap, you will feel it chill down your spine. This movie is realistic without being overzealous or overdramatic.

CRIMSON TIDE is a superb action thriller, and with this all new extended unrated cut, you'll see more action than you bargained for the first time around. And with two terrific performances from Hackman and Washington, you can't go wrong with a movie of this caliber.",1147564800,6,1738,5.003460207612457
709778,5,6303696813,"This is a simply amazing movie, and what makes it even more stellar is that we've had several fantastic submarine movies in the past - Das Boot and Red October come to mind. We've already seen the claustrophobic, booming power of being trapped in an underwater submarine. That this movie is able to make that closeness even more powerful - and draw us into a story that really grips you with its meaning - is rather impressive.

We begin with two powerhouses of actors, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington. Gene is in charge of the sub; Denzel works for him. Gene is an unabashed alpha male, not unheard of in a commander. Denzel is intelligent and respects the chain of command. Suddenly, we're thrown into a situation where the sub *might* have been ordered to launch a missile attack on an enemy to protect the US. Unfortunately, the sub can't get confirmation. So either they shoot and risk starting WWIII for no reason - or they fail to shoot and leave millions of people open to slaughter.

The plot and dialogue is incredible because it explores all the shades of grey in the characters. There's no right or wrong. Both scenarios are equally plausible. Gene wants to do what he was ordered to do, to save as many lives as he can. Denzel is desperate to get confirmation rather than risk mistakenly starting a world war. Both men suck up the men around them into their sides. Nobody WANTS the war. Gene doesn't take pleasure in firing - but he sees it as a necessary action to save lives.

In such close confines, every person on screen makes a huge difference. This movie had not only two stellar top men, but also a fantastic supporting cast. James Gandolfini a la Sopranos. Viggo Mortensen a la Lord of the Rings. The music from Hans Zimmer is just amazing. He is a genius and can give incredibly subtle nuances to his works.

If I had to find something to nit-pick in this movie, it's that I don't think the sub scenes were truly ""realistic"". It seemed more of a Hollywood sub than a real working piece of machinery that trained soldiers were living in for months. I think Das Boot did an exquisite job of getting that sense across. But really, the sub in this case was a ""set"" for the dialogue and character development to happen in. It wasn't the showcase, and this wasn't a sub documentary. So I'm willing to accept that tradeoff, so that we could have as tightly woven a story as we got.",1144627200,3,2400,4.497706422018348
709779,5,6303696813,"The very best war movies resonate with viewers not just because of top flight acting but because there is always a subtext present that demands that viewers think as well as view.  In CRIMSON TIDE, director Tony Scott allows the events on the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine, to force viewers to confront some truly ugly but inevitable revelations: that in some dicey situations there are no good versus bad guys, just decent men who demand that events follow their own unique perceptions of those events.

Gene Hackman is Captain Ramsey, a tough nuclear sub skipper who has just received an order to launch his sub's missles at Russia, which has just discovered that one of its military bases has been taken over by a rogue general who is determined to launch his missles at America.  Just after Ramsey receives his order to launch, the needed verfication to launch does not arrive due to an unexpected underwater confrontation with a Russian sub.  The Alabama's radio is damaged. Should Ramsey launch anyway on the premise that to delay can lead only to the certainty that the Russians will get the first blow in? His XO, Lieutenant Commander Turner (Denzel Washington) does not think so.  Both believe that the other is totally wrong.  Turner leads a mutiny to prevent the launch.

CRIMSON TIDE is a claustrophobic testosterone filled plunge into the icy waters of duty versus rationality.  Hackman injects his role with the total believability of ruthlessness that has come to mark his essential film persona.  He can slug Washington in the face in one scene to enforce his decision to launch.  Then in the very next scene can placidly discuss horse breeding with the same man with the same believability. CRIMSON TIDE is a film of men under stress with some handling it better than others.  George Dzundza has a powerful supporting role as the head of security who is forced by circumstances to back Washington, whom he believes to be in the right over Ramsey, a captain whom he greatly respects but believes to be in the wrong.  When Ramsey regains control, Dzundza grudgingly admits, ""Half of me is glad that he did.""  And that right there is the compelling subtext of the movie: that events force both actor and viewer to decide whether unfolding events ought to fill us with fear that one or the other side may be in the Right--but never knowing which is which.  CRIMSON TIDE is a terrific film that requires the viewer to face such a choice whether he wants to or not.",1144454400,,2479,4.748251748251748

One of the best military flicks I've ever seen.  Chock full of emotion, intensity and suspense, ""Crimson Tide"" takes the viewer on a whirlwind tour of life, death, and warfare on a nuclear Naval submarine.  Hackman is the captain of the Alabama, a sub destined to launch nuclear missiles on Russia in a last ditch attempt to suppress rebel forces in that country.  Denzel Washington is the handpicked XO that is forced to make a terrible decision.  During an undersea battle with rebel forces, an emergency message is lost during transmission.  Was the message sent to stop plans to fire the nuclear missiles or to go ahead with the plans?  Hackman insists he go ahead with his original orders to launch the nukes.  Washington stands against him and has the captain sent to his quarters.  All of this is done by the book.  What results is a mutiny by the captain in an attempt to regain control of his sub and continue his original mission.

Full of intense sequences involving life and death situations, this film left me exhausted by the constant decisions made and the timing of each event.  Hackman and Washington were superb in their roles.  Each conveyed the emotion and allegiance of their respective characters flawlessly.

But the list of excellent actors doesn't stop there.  Viggo Mortensen, of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hidalgo"" fame, plays Webster.  He's Washington's friend and a loyal officer on the ship who literally holds the fate of the world in his hands.  Steve Zahn (""Saving Silverman,"" ""Daddy Daycare,"" ""Happy, Texas"") is solid in a supporting role.  Former child star Rick Schroder also appears in a brief but moving role.  Danny Nucci (""Titanic"") plays an officer who stands for what he believes is right.  James Gandolfini (""The Sopranos"") is also here in a wonderfully sinister role as Hackman's loyal shipmate.  Oh, and don't forget to throw in Ryan Phillipe (""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Cruel Intentions""), who has a miniscule role but does well none the less.  There are other faces in the crowd who haven't achieved as much fame, but you'll recognize them from smaller roles in other films.  For instance, George Dzundza, who's been in a ton of films but never a star and Scott Grimes, who I only knew was in this film when I saw the credits role.  You may recognize Grimes' name from ""Critters.""  In short, this motion picture has a very capable cast of well-known performers, future stars, and minor players who fill out the plot exceptionally well.

Highly recommended to fans of claustrophobic cinema such as ""The Hunt For Red October"" and naval stories in general.  Also, fans of intense drama will definitely enjoy this film.",1134518400,,2920,4.844444444444444

It has been said very often that when most of people affirm: ""Everything is under control, is precisely due they do not know what's going on.""

An old marine lion (Gene Hackman), accustomed to deal and win in other scenarios, will be severally confronted in a double panel: first against a premise, based on the uncertainness about the true potential of the enemy. But there is still another obstacle to defeat: An officer of the new generations, trained under the concepts of asymmetric wars, emotional intelligence and that ancient Chinese legend: ""Listen the forest sounds.""

When the discussion reaches unbearable levels, and escapes of rational limits it appeals very often to ancient arguments, experience, patriotism, the voice tune gradually increases to silence perhaps you have not any cards to show on the table and once this occurs, the passion acts and your acquired instructions are ignored and verbal violence works out as a boomerang, degrading your previous status of maximum authority and relegating automatically your nominal command pressed and besieged under this unsaved circumstances. Remember Macbeth `s last moments. He has credibility and when this happens your weakness surge as a volcanic eruption.  It is a similar case when you are playing chess and know the end is near. You can move your supporting pieces to save the king but these are just desperate actions to prolong artificial or nominally an irreversible result.

The struggle is between a hard-headed veteran sub captain (Hackman) and an ivy-school (Harvard) and Annapolis-trained Executive Officer (Washington) -more than that, the tension lies between the cold warrior realism of the past and the relative pacifism of the modern age - the nuclear age.

The story and sub take unexpected twists and turns in this dramatic encounter with the rebellious Ruskies. Will the crew remain faithful or not? Will the chain of command win out over caution? Will strength bow before perceived weakness? Will it be peace or war?

709853,4,6303696813,"This is one of the best films about submarines that has been made, joining the classic Das Boot and The Hunt for Red October among many others.  It's got two heavyweights in the lead roles - Gene Hackman as the Capitan of the USS Alabama and Denzel Washington has his First Officer.  The depth of the acting talent goes far deeper than the two main characters, including 'before they were stars' roles for James Gandolfini (The Sopranos) and Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings).

The film is generally well directed, although the Hackman character mostly gets its shadings from comments made by others rather than seeing character himself show off his facets.  This is not a major flaw, as the capitan is essentially a supporting character in a film told from Washington's point of view.  The film does not get off to a good start with some corny text about the capitan of a nuclear missile submarine being as powerful as the President of the United States.  After a few rough scenes, however, the film hits its stride as the crew go off to sea; director Tony Scott does an excellent job of keeping the plot moving, and there are enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Even if you've seen the film 10 times, you will still feel the tension of the final scenes on board the submarine, a mark that the film is truly well directed.

The score by Hans Zimmer adds to the tension of the confrontation without being intrusive.  It's nothing you'll be humming when you leave, but it is another solid piece of work from a veteran composer.  Likewise, the way that the film is shot emphasizes the close quarters on board a submarine as well as any film in recent memory.

Besides the opening text, the main problem with the DVD is that there's basically nothing of interest on it besides foreign language tracks.  This is unfortunate, as commentary by Hackman and Washington would probably be a classic for film students and aspiring actors to listen to.

  And yeah, the Amazon reviewer is right, The Caine Mutiny is also ripped off. As well as Mutiny on the Bounty and about five different Star Trek episodes (especially The Doomsday Machine- Vulcans never bluff).

  At its absolute nadir, we find that the threat of nuclear war and different philosophies of the Captain and XO are not enough to create dramatic tension- there is actually a racial beef between the characters.

Ok, how about this: The boat (sub's are referred to as ""boats"" not ""ships"") is crippled by a torpedo explosion, and the Chief of the Boat announces to the XO (Denzel Washington),""forward ballast tanks damaged. we've lost forward air"". The next moment, the boat's main propulsion plant is lost, and the sub is shown heading downward into the depths. Do they move the bow planes / fairwater planes or stern planes to use forward momentum to help the boat rise? NO. Do they blow after ballast (the after ballast tanks are presumably still operational)? NO. What do they do? They just ALL STAND THERE staring at the depth gauge, awaiting their arrival at ""crush depth"", the depth at which the surrounding pressure of the sea will be more than the pressure hull can withstand and the sub will implode and kill them all.

709954,5,6303696813,"Surprisingly the most worrying thing about this movie comes at the end when it tells us that from 1996 onwards the key to launching Nuclear weapons no longer resides with the Commander of a U.S. nuclear submarine but with the President of the United States. Given that Bush is in power that should be enough to scare the living Jesus out of anyone and maybe the Hackman's of the world should be given back the responsibility as long there is a Washington beside him who is ready to turn around say ""King Kong ain't got nothin' on me!""
Not since John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" has there been a damn fine movie about paranoia and tension. Crimson Tide does all that in aces and then some more. Basically the premise is about a Commander and an XO of a nuclear submarine that are given orders to set sail and be prepared for EAMs (Emergency Action Messages) that will tell them if and when they should launch the Big One. One action message tells them to launch. The second is scrambled beyond all recognition. This leads to a standoff between the Commander and the XO and a crew split over whose orders they should follow.
So basically it is high-octane ping pong as the two commanders go back and forth, debating what they should do, putting guns to each others head, dodging torpedoes and generally trying to toe the official navy line while at the same time breaking all the rules in the book. The script is good except for some inappropriate references to Star Trek but all the actors do a good job with the roles they are given and Hackman performs to the point where we remember again why he is A-list material. Washington is on form and makes a good piece of opposition, but can not prevent the Hack from walking circles around him. Today however it is the opposite way around which shows how talent is something that may not be perpetual.
You can not go too far wrong with this one. Sure it is all USA! USA! with lots of melodrama and crew members patting each other's backs right up until the ""all is forgiven"" finale but then again we can give the movie its token gestures for coming up with a simple idea done exceptionally well. This is not ""Das Boot"" but it transcends ""U-751"" and ""The Sum of All Fears"" and also gives us much more edge of your seat stuff than ""The Hunt from Red October"".

Ron Hunter, the new XO on a nuclear sub The Crimson Tide, Captained by Capt. Frank Ramsey, Gene Hackman in another typically strong and dis-likable performance.  Gene's character is arrogant, slightly redneck, got-there-the-hard-way subdriver and has overbearing manner, right down to an irritating little dog named Jack Daniels.  He is slightly intimidated by Denzel's highly education, got there by hard study, and naturally tries to deny this - even to himself - but the personality clash is going to happen.

Gung Ho, slightly power-mad, Gene Hackman, believe is orders to the letter.  In this case, in lack of confirmation they are directed to launch to prevent a first attack against US.  Denzel, a less war-minded officer, prefers to wait for a bit to confirm before signing the death warrant on the world.  And he is willing to back this by taking over command of the ship.  Naturally, Hackman is not taking that and fights back.
In the middle of this struggle, is Weps (Yeppers, Aragon in a buzz cut!!).  Viggo Mortensen's character, Lt. Peter 'Weps' Ince, respects both men.  He is friends with Denzel, but he has served together with Hackman as more will to work with him.

Faced with such a confined environment, I'd go bonkers in minutes (heck, I don't even go into my closet).  So my phobia made watching CRIMSON TIDE even more of a heart-pounding experience, but a rewarding experience just the same.
Hard to go wrong with acting icons Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington; these two guys could read a recipe for blueberry muffins and make it spellbinding.  And the plot of this film is fascinating:  a maverick Russian politican taking control of a Soviet nuclear base and threatening to launch missiles into the U.S.; the deployment of American nuclear submarines; a crafty, veteran submarine captain (Hackman) pitted against his new executive officer (Washington); an order to launch a pre-emtpive strike; a subsequent order transmission that is interrupted; an attack from a rogue Russian sub; mutiny on the USS Alabama.

Yet it did enhance the look and feel of a tension-dripping military mission, a mission with the the fate of the world on its problematic shoulders.

710019,5,6303696813,"Crimson Tide is a high adrenaline drama, with a solid cast, and a terrific and engaging plot.  Probably the best submarine movie since Hunt for the Red October, Crimson Tide does everything it can to create instant suspense and interest in this movie and it succeeds.  The movie stars Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, who play off each other brilliantly.
Washington plays Hunter, the Executive Officer (Exo) of the submarine U.S.S. Alabama.  Hunter is the play it straight, humble but serious, follow the rules kind of officer.  Hunter follows his conscience and what he knows is right, and is not easily persuaded.  This is the trademark character of almost every character Washington plays, with the exception of his role in Training Day.
Hackman plays Capt. Ramsey, the hard-nosed, bull-headed, confrontational captain of the very same submarine.  Ramsey doesn't believe in advice or even his conscience, just his orders and making no exceptions.  Hackman, whose personna often comes across as arrogant and head strong, is a the exact kind of actor one would want for this part.
As noticed, Ramsey and Hunter are almost opposites, which leads us to the conflict of characters.  It's analogy can be described as hot air and cold air mixing...and one should know what that forms.  This is picked up very early in the film, when Ramsey is interviewing Hunter to be his next Exo.
This was the signal that Ramsey is not easily impressed nor does he truly think highly of Hunter.  A problem that does not go away throughout the film.
The plot is a little complicated, but it can be summarized.  Basically, it's about Russian rebels who seize Russian warheads.  These rebels then begin making threats towards America and Japan.  Enter the US Navy, deploying it's nuke subs all across the world to be prepared to launch if needed.  The U.S.S. Alabama is among them.
I think this is a terrific plot and I think the movie did an admirable job in attempting to make it appear real or quite very possible.  They did this by including live footage (obviously from other wars), interviews with the madman or leader of the rebels, and creating a series of events that quite possibly could occur.  I was really impressed with how they did all this in the beginning of the movie, so we all got a sense of what the movie was going to be about.
Unfortunately, I'm not all that impressed with some of the criticism given to this film from fellow reviewers.  The biggest gripe is that this film does not portray submariners accurately, that the way they acted is not possible and it's a slap in the face to our Navy.  Look, I have no doubt that there are inaccuracies in how Navy personel are ""supposed"" to act or how submarine life persists.  But that doesn't mean it's a slap.  It just means it isn't portrayed accurately.
Not to mention, this criticism is over-blown and it isn't what the movie is about.  I think people who get all upset over this film, as far as the portrayal of submariners, need to get a grip.  This film is about two things that not even the US Navy is immune to: human judgment and human error.  In order for that concept to be applied in this sense, you can't have all the submariners acting all perfect and do nothing wrong and create no conflicts on board.  This is a drama.  That stuff must occur otherwise it's a boring movie.  So wake up, get off your high horse, and just enjoy the movie.  The movie is about a broader scope than the portrayal of our Navy.  The movie is about the possible break down of our system, the break down of officers, and the forever curse of human misjudgment.
This film will make you think, and that's what I like about it.  You're entertained and you think about this movie during and after you see it.  This movie was made to create drama at the ultimate expense in the worst of times.  So if you want to see what I consider the best submarine movie out there, go see Crimson Tide.
Grade: A-",1065657600,,3939,4.600286532951289
710020,5,6303696813,"""Crimson Tide"" is certainly one of the most gripping and thrilling submarine films to have been released in several years.  From the intriguing initial opening moments of this submarine classic to the most suspenseful and tense moments of character conflict, this film will have you on the edge of your seat, whether it's the first or tenth time you've watched it.  I personally try to watch this film at least once a year as it can easily be said that this is one of my favorite movies from this genre.
It is truly quite scary to think that there is even the most ""remote"" possibility that something like this could ever occur on a missile boat.  Given the power that just one of these submarines has, they could hold the world's population in the palm of their hands.
The power of this film not only comes from the power of the extraordinary script but lies solely with the superb performance of the lead characters.  Whenever a tough and true grit role is to be had, Gene Hackman is the one to call as this role seems to have been written specifically for him.  Though not quite the villain of the film, he's not quite the hero either, his character of Captain Ramsey represents the old Navy and the ""way things were.""  In the role of the younger and extremely well educated Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander Hunter, is Denzel Washington representing the new Navy as he delivers another extraordinarily powerful performance.  In my humble opinion, this role represents one of his best efforts out of all the great performances he's given in so many films over the years.
One may also wish to take note of some of the other characters and the level of fame they've risen to since making ""Crimson Tide"" in 1995.  Most notable are Viggo Mortensen of ""Lord of the Rings"" fame and a much thinner James Gandolfini of ""The Soprano's"" fame.
Director Tony Scott deserves all the credit in the world for the perfection that is, ""Crimson Tide"" and the way in which he put this outstanding film together.
In the past, I've watched films of this nature where the soundtrack just didn't seem to ""go"" with the film.  That is certainly not the case here, the soundtrack is ""right on"" with the action sequences and serves beautifully to enhance every scene in the film.
The premise:
In the realm of ""possible predictabilities,"" a post Soviet Union, Russia is facing a possible civil war where one of the prominent leaders has broken away from the central Russian government.  Many forces have allied behind him and he has seized a base that houses, of all things, nuclear weapons and has threatened launch if he is openly opposed by Allied forces.  Fearing that this ""madman"" may actually get hold of the launch codes for these weapons, the NCA (National Command Authority or President for short) has decided to emplace nuclear submarines and hopefully preempt this Russian rebel if he does get hold of the launch codes and launches.  Not to mention the fact that the Russian rebel leader has also gained the support of a submarine base and has put to sea several Akula class attack submarines.
We learn most of that within the first few minutes of the film and this thrilling gripper of a movie ""actually"" kicks off when the USS Alabama and her crew put to sea, heading for their assigned patrol/launch area.  All the while, Captain Ramsey is testing his new Executive Officer, Lt. Commander Hunter.  Once the Alabama reaches her assigned station, they find themselves in very close quarters with one of the Russian Akula class submarines.  Concurrently, they also receive a flash message to go to DEFCON 2 and launch several ""packages.""  While preparing the submarine and its missiles for launch, they go deeper and on their way down, they start to receive another message.  Unfortunately, they go too deep and don't receive the entire message.  Here is where the major conflict begins because the Executive Officer wishes to confirm the orders and the Captain chooses not to and continues to prepare to launch.
What follows from there is, as stated above, one of the most gripping submarine stories to ever grace the silver screen.  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre as you will certainly enjoy every aspect of it.  {ssintrepid}
Special Features:
Here is where I have a ""bone of contention"" with the producers of this film.  There are exactly ""zero"" special features with this film, not even a trailer.

The story is fascinating, fast-paced, and the acting by Hackman and especially by Denzel Washington is excellent.  I thought the supporting cast was pretty bad.  Or maybe it was the script.  I still can't decide.
This movie only rates 2 stars because it contains one intractible flaw: the crew of the Alabama is portrayed as being a bunch of amateurs.  Not so: submarine professionals simply do not, would not, and could not behave as this movie portrays them.  Essentially, this movie shows a billion dollar submarine being crewed by high school dropout comic-book readers (really!).  It's just not so.  The movie could have been done with the same plot without making this assumption.  (By the way, I was never in the Navy--I don't have a dog in this fight.)  Having the events in this movie occur among an accurately portrayed submarine crew of professionals would have made this movie ten times better, and a candidate for 5 stars. That is what Seven Days In May essentially did--it showed the military accurately portrayed from a character standpoint. But no.

710097,5,6303696813,"In the tradition of other great submarine movies such as ""The Hunt for Red October"", ""U-571"", and ""Das Boot"", ""Crimson Tide"" provides non-stop action and thrills throughout.  Gene Hackman stars as captain Ramsey, a 30 year vet of the navy who doesn't tend to do things by the book most of the time.  Denzel Washington gives a top-notch performance as Lt. Commander Hunter, the ship's new X.O. A recent graduate of Harvard and Annapolis, he is the antithesis of Ramsey.  He tends to follow protocol and standard procedure.  This pairing of the two opposite officers eventually leads to all-out confrintation.
Russia is engaged in a civil war, and the USS Alabama is dispatched to the region after the rebel Russian leader makes threats about launcing nuclear weapons against the United States. Ultimately, a message reaches the Alabama stating that the Russian rebels are indeed fueling their nuclear weapons to launch, so the Alabama is to launch a pre-emptive strike first.  However, while under attack, another message comes in to the Alabama, but only part of the message is received.  Ramsey wants to continue with the launch preparations, but Hunter wants clarification of the second message before finishing launch preparations.  This confrontation leads to division between Ramsey and Hunter, as well as the crew.  The rest of the film is loaded with action and reaction as Hunter and Ramsey struggle for control of the sub and the crew.
I highly recommend this movie.  The performances by the actors are tremendous, and the battle and underwater scenes are good as well.  This movie is a must for action/adventure and submarine fans.  Roll Tide!",1034812800,,1653,5.062730627306273

 Overall, I was really impressed with the movie. It didn't depend on special effects, the actors did great at their part, especially Hackman and Washington, and the movie didn't drag. Plus, it wasn't even two hours, like Lord Of The Rings, Titanic, Pearl Harbour and Gladiator, were all too long.

710099,3,6303696813,"It is a cliche to dismiss/celebrate Tony Scott's films as being too enamroured of technology and military hardware to be very interested in character.  But for me, the two main reasons to watch 'Crimson Tide' are two performances that work against their noisy surroundings.  Most important is Gene Hackman in a stock role (the 'old school' sea-dog who despises the vacillation of newer, by-the-book men), who brings out his character's humour, perceptive intelligence, bravery and pathos (he has recently lost his wife) as well as his dangerous fascism.  The film's best scenes are those in the first third when, under the guise of friendly initiation, he tries to psyche out his insufferably self-righteous second-in-command, played by Denzel Washington.  Even when the film moves from a battle of ideas (about war, masculinity, nation etc.) into a predictable melodrama, Hackman survives the film's attempts to demonise him (horror lighting, racism) or worse, make him ridiculous, a kind of military Blofeld, plotting dark conspiracies as he strokes his beloved dog.  It is this omnipresent mutt who crowns Hackman's character, piddling all over the ship, alert to his daddy's every mood, tenacious in warding off threats (at one point left to torture two of his captors in the officers' mess). The prop of the dog was probably suppposed to be a mark of effeminacy, decadence or misplaced/perverted priorities, but only people who never had a dog, like Washington's stolid do-gooder, could even think that.  It's no coincidence that this apparent bad guy shares caps, cigars and attitudes with the film's creator, director Scott.  In spite of what he says, it is Hackman who is complex and Washington who is simple and one-dimensional.
The second, less obvious (at the time) pleasure is James Gandolfini's performance, already flashing brooding, brutal intimations of Tony Soprano, anticipating that legendary character's ease in tough male company, his colourful wit, his taste for ritual humiliation, and his warped attachment to a code of loyalty and honour.  Like Tony, he is a cinephile, and rightly punishes a junior for ignorance of Robert Mitchum movies.  This pop-culture patter that occasionally punctuates the film is the script's most dated aspect, and is the work of script-doctor-for-hire, Quentin Tarantino.  The attempts to add a self-reflexivity to a Simpson&Bruckheimer macho action movie by placing it in the tradition of previous submarine movies is just a fudge, as the modes of the action movie are reinforced.  However, this scene is a warning index of warped jingoism even at this early stage - Gandolfini knows about 'The Enemy Below' and 'Run Silent, Run Deep', but he's clearly never heard of a foreign film like 'Das Boot'.  And it's nice to see a mainstream Hollywood film that acknowledges the life-or-death importance of pop culture.
These two elements were enough for me.  I found it very difficult to follow what was going on half the time, so much suspense was lost; luckily, I was watching the film with a Tom Clancy fan who was familiar enough with the jargon (he'd never seen 'Das Boot' either.  Hmmm...)  Shorn of its trendy Tarantinoisms, the script was solid and interesting.  The introduction of characters was dispiriting - you know exactly who would take which side whenever crisis obtruded.  But there was an excellent satiric thrust: early, faintly sickening jingoism is quite searchingly and cynicially questioned subsequently - a pattern of twinning Hackman and Washington makes the latter less clean-cut than he first appears (e.g. both are betrayed by friends); while Hackman himself is the image of the military, Kurtzian mind turned in on itself and gone mad - another paralellism, when he twice gives Viggo Mortenson a count of three to save a life, equates the word 'sir', and all the ideological baggage it brings with it, with something more appropriate to his dog.  There is some interesting colour-coding too.  One wag compared the film's Tarantino-inspired homoerotics to Fassbinder's 'Querelle'.  A nice idea.",1020816000,3,4070,5.22273425499232

Alabama, is unsurprisingly paralled to the mutiny on the Royal British ship, the H.M.S. Bounty. This downfall to the script is only minor. British director Tony Scott (brother of Ridley Scott) presents audiences with a raw, explosive, brutal, and tense film that truly recaptures the era of the Cold War, and a time when the United States and Soviet Russia were enemies. Even the clash of wills between both the characters played by Hackman and Washington were intense. One wishes that Washington had just given Hackman the missile launch key, instead of being given the left hook twice. If there is one rule that new officers should learn, it is this. You do not turn any order into a debate with a seasoned veteran who has ""been there and done that."" Overall, a remarkable film with excellent acting, a semi-solid plot, and powerful soundtrack. It is certainly more entertaining than visiting the website of ACRENSHAW - Computer Primadonna.",1015891200,,1237,5.009708737864078

Tony Scott definitely brought his ""A game"" to this one.  Lately, I've been doubting his abilities with the recent viewings of some of his productions, but Crimson Tide changed my opinion entirely about him.
Also, there was a great supporting cast of then unknowns with the likes of Rocky Carrol, James Gandolfini, and Rick Shroder.  This movie definitely gave the boost to these men's careers that they so deservedly needed.
Crimson Tide is one of those movies that comes around every so often that leaves an imprint in your memory of how a movie should be made.  5 Stars",1007856000,,791,4.801470588235294
710156,5,6303696813,"After seeing this film, I'd sware that it was made from a Clancey script. Incredible! Very believable story. Very believable environment. The technology on a modern submarine is something that must be seen to be believed.
Gene Hackman plays a submarine commander that is past his prime. He runs a tip top ship with a tip top crew. Everything with him is all business.
Washington is his executive officer. Much younger with different political ideas.
The special effects are superb. The set for the submarine is awesome. Even all the supporting actors that play the crew do an excellent job.
There are some slow parts in the beginning as the main characters are introduced, but once past the first 15 minutes, the film takes off and the hunt is on.",1006214400,2,747,4.753846153846154

'Crimson Tide' is such a film, and it brings together the antagonist of 'Superman' (Gene Hackman) and the protagonist of 'Malcolm X' (Denzel Washington). In it, both actors battle against each other on the same side, and the film becomes a war of internal struggles rather than external victories. Overall, it is one of the best films of 1995.",1003190400,2,453,4.896103896103896
710158,4,6303696813,"If you must acquire a pumped-up thriller for an undemanding evening's viewing, I would recommend this one over such ghastly fare as 'The Rock', or the truly moronic 'Armageddon'.
'Das Boot' is generally acceped as the greatest submarine film, but this is certainly preferable to 'The Hunt For Red October', let alone the dire 'U-571'.
Gene Hackman is here in top scenery-chewing (but credible) form as the ball-breaking, cigar-chomping submarine captain, and even Denzel Washington's character manages to be something slightly more than a two dimensional cipher. The only other actor of note (apart from Jason Robards in an uncredited cameo at the end) is the great James Gandolfini in pre-Tony Soprano mode.
To be fair, most plotline fiascos are avoided and the storyline is handled with an element of self-belief. Although the climax of the film is as predictable as night following day, this is overall an enjoyable ride.
There is even an enjoyable and interesting sequence in the officers' mess when the nature of war is discussed. My advice is to regard the post-climactic board of enquiry as the film's genuine denouement.
In fact the only real cliches are to be found on the Hans Zimmer-composed soundtrack (all proto-Gladiator pounding rhythms and wordless vocalise), although to be fair his inclusion of a choral version of 'Those In Peril On The Sea' as the sub makes its initial dive is a masterstroke.
The DVD is bare bones, but with a superbly powerful soundtrack. The image is thoroughly decent, although the R2 DVD (which I viewed) is anamorphic and of very high quality - near flawless in fact. If the judge of a transfer is crystal clear depiction of perspiring flesh, when every bead of sweat and facial corpuscle has an almost dermatological clarity, this DVD passes with flying colours.
Recommended, especially if you fancy giving your sound system a thorough workout with groaning hulls and window-rattling depth charge detonations.",994723200,,1953,5.10625
710159,5,6303696813,"""Crimson Tide"" is a study of the possibility of a World War III. A nuclear submarine is one of the more powerful weapons that the United States of America possesses. For that reason, the men inside are trained professionals who understand what to do to take care of any situation that arises, until a disagreement develops between the captain and the executive officer.
The difference of opinions comes from an emergency action message that is cut short due to extreme weather conditions. Whether or not the Russians are going to attack us is the question at hand, and one officer believes that we should attack and another believes that we should abort. Ultimately, Washington and Hackman bicker at each other in an entertaining way and the environment spells fear of a nuclear holocaust. For moviegoers that aren't usually fans of submarine movies, this is a terrific movie regardless of your tastes.

With fine talent like Hackman and Washington (not to mention the intriguing quality of Hackman's character) and an initial plot premise loaded with potential, this could have been a top-notch drama along the lines of but much better than Seven Days in May or The Bedford Incident. Instead the writers developed a plot so attenuated in its relationship to reality (no boomer sailor can sit through this film without feeling the urgent need to howl bulls--- with ever increasing frequency as it ""progresses"") that all you're left with is a very low grade 'B' adolescent shoot 'em up picture.  What a shame.

This is yet another fabulous movie by Jerry Bruckenheimer, although, unlike most of his films, this one is a drama rather than an action movie.  The sequence of events is quite credible & authentic as to what does & could happen on an SSBN should the order be given to unleash her missiles.  The writers invoked the services of both Captains (Blue & Gold crew) of the real USS Alabama to make it as realistic as possible.  Great touch!

710165,5,6303696813,"Something about the world of the submarine lends itself to thrilling moviemaking.  From ""Das Boot"" and ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" to ""The Hunt for Red October,"" the blind, claustrophobic atmosphere of a wartime submarine at sea comes across very well.
""Crimson Tide"" comes in ahead of those other movies because of the caliber of actors involved.  Denzel Washington (the XO, Lt. Cdr. Hunter) and Gene Hackman (the CO, Capt. Ramsey) each give one of the better performances of their illustrious careers in this movie.
Russian rebels have captured missile silos in the far eastern edge of that country.  They then threaten to launch their missiles at the U.S.  The U.S.S. Alabama, a ballistic missile submarine, is deployed to the western Pacific to possibly launch a pre-emptive strike on the rebels.  After the Alabama arrives on station, its new orders are cut off before they can be confirmed.  Lt. Cdr. Hunter wants to wait and confirm the new orders delaying the strike.  Capt. Ramsey wants to follow the previous set of orders carrying out the strike.  This sets up a confrontation and darn-near full-scale mutiny as the entire crew takes sides with either the XO or the Captain.
The best scene of the movie is when the officers are gathered in the captain's mess.  There is an interesting debate between the old-school captain and the youngblood XO about the nature of war, and whether it changes or not.  Ramsey sums it up in this line to Hunter: ""When Rickover gave me my command, they showed me a button.  All I had to know was how to push it.  They'd tell me when.  They seem to want you to know why.""  The next best scene is after the entire operation is over.  Capt. Ramsey and Lt. Cdr. Hunter face each other and salute, a young warrior saluting an old veteran, their disagreements in the past and their mutual respect coming through.
I also give kudos to whoever is responsible for the scenes in the weapons room.  The few lights reflecting the sweat on the weapons officer's face really elevated the tension towards the end of the movie.
This movie will have you on the edge of your seat for over two hours.  It will also cause you to think, especially about the vast changes our world has undergone in the past 10 years.",974246400,10,2232,4.667519181585678
710266,5,6303696813,"If you think about it, Hackman can play it all; hero (Poseidon adventure), comic-book villain (Superman's Luthor), bad guy (Absolute Power, Unforgiven), good guy (Coach in The Replacements), action-hero (Enemy of the State), military hero (Uncommon Valor, March or Die), military anti-hero (Crimson Tide). That he can draw on his inner self to portray all these characters says a lot for him as a human being that he knows the range of human attitudes/emotions and can ""run with them"".
The music of Crimson Tide is what drives the movie as the submarine drives under the water DEEP. Need to get a CD of this sound track! What sets you on edge is as the submarine dives at an angle, the music reminds you again, again that the stakes involved are total. It builds to a climax confrontation and we are spared WWIII.
What makes the film special is the ending----I don't want to spoil it but if you have seen the film, continue. Hackman's character in the end respects and recommends the XO played by Washington and they mend fences and salute with the rousing score in the background. That's the way it is in real life when men have their differances; real men want others to stand up for what they believe in because in the hour of need we will need that perspective---we are only the sum of who we are and we are not infallible, this is why we have two men holding the two nuclear keys for each weapon system. This flies in the face of the popular go-along-to-get-along PCness which infects our age with mediocrity--had one of these thinking-of-his careeer-first types been aboard as the XO, the nuclear missiles would have been launched.

I have loved every  other movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer that I have seen, and this was no  exception.  One is instantly drawn into the story, with its shocking,  twisting plot, powerful lines, and dazzlingly spectacular imagery.  Washington and Hackman are at their best in this amazing movie, dealing  with emminent world war, a triple mutiny onboard the boomer USS Alabama,  and a pursuing Akula-class Russian fast attack sub.  The action is  abundant, the suspense palpable, but the movie's best attribute is probably  its dialogue, which is as emotional and forceful as the readyroom scene in  Star Trek: First Contact.

First  we have the authoritarian, do it my way or hit the highway, Captain Gene  Hackman.  Need I say he played this role to perfection.  Then we have the  Executive Officer who is intelligent and wants both sides of the story  Denzel Washington.  Need I say he did a great job with this role.
The  background info. is that the Cold War is heating up again as the Russian  republics are battling each other and the U.S. has moved in to help because  of the threat of Nuclear weapons being used.  The USS Alabama Nuclear  Submarine is called upon to move near Russia because if Nuclear Weapons are  stolen by the Russian President and his forces, the Submarine has a Nuclear  payload to destroy most of the country.  As they are getting closer an  incoming Emergency Action Message (EAM) is received and they are to arm the  Nuclear Missles and be ready to fire.  While going through this preparing  to fire another EAM is coming in, but they are also under attack by a  Russian sub so the transmission is not complete.  This is where Gene and  Denzel's characters argue over what to do.  Gene's wants to continue with  the mission and destroy the Russian's.  Denzel's wants to repair the broken  communication line and see if they are to continue or back off and wait for  further instruction.  What we have here is a Mutiny and one of the most  suspenseful films I have seen in some time.
This movie keeps you on the  edge of your seat the whole time and in the end, well you have to buy this  movie and see for yourself, because it is a good one.

710269,4,6303696813,"Wow! This is one that is sure to raise your blood pressure and get the old heart pounding! The movie is set in the near future, during a time of extreme instability and potential military adventurism in the crumbling  Russian republics. As a result of all that is going on, old cold-war  tensions are revived, igniting a heightened military readiness in the USA  and sending an anxious submarine crew venturing on patrol into position to  potentially launch its inventory of ICBMs at Russia if ordered. Under these  circumstance, and based on contradictory information coming in piecemeal  from the outside world, a mutiny occurs between the eccentric and stern  authoritarian skipper, played brilliantly by Gene Hackman, and his  executive officer, also played extremely well by Denzel Washington.
The  story line leading to the mutiny, and what happens as a result of it is all  quite plausible, and given the fact that the submarine has enough missile  power to destroy most of industrial Russia as we know it, it is quite a  believable and cautionary tale. The drama is well scripted and well acted,  and one is hard-pressed to know who is right and wrong regarding the  decisions made and actions taken. I was at the edge of my easy chair  throughout the movie, and at times it was intense enough to be what I call  ""white-knuckle time"". It is a movie I both enjoyed and learned  from, and it should soften even the hardest hearts among us as to the  dangers of having fully armed weapon systems like nuclear missile  submarines in the hands of fallible human beings, who no matter how well  trained and disciplined, are still frail and vulnerable people just like  us.

Right from the opening of this film you just know that this will  be something special. The title music, infact all the music, is incredebly  good and fits the story line of the film particually well.
Unlike other  submarine warfare I've seen, this had a carefully thought out story line.  Almost every phrase was metaphore or simile that had a deeper meaning in  life.

The plot? Russian dissidents seize control of a nuclear  missile base and have threaten to launch at the United States. The U.S.S.  Alabama has been ordered to launch missiles to take out the base, but the  crew is divided between their captain (Gene Hackman) and their executive  officer (Denzel Washington). After the ship is attacked by a renegade sub  Hackman wants to ignore an unconfirmed order to stand down. Washington  wants to confirm the order before firing.
The audience has the ultimate  catch-22. Do you side with Hackman, follow orders, and launch missiles? Or  do you do the safe thing and go with Washington? It's not an easy choice  and it is not presented to the audience with a clear-cut moral  either.
Kudos to the actors all around- Washington, Hackman, and the rest  of the cast do a terrific job in their roles. The music is stunning (I own  and LOVE the soundtrack) and the action will keep you on the edge of your  seat.
