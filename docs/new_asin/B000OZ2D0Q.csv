8187828,3,B000OZ2D0Q,"ST. CLAIR's ""signature"" series each consist of three public domain films (on a single DVD) that are good, but not necessarily the featured artist's best work.

THE JACK NICHOLSON SIGNATURE COLLECTION might be co-signed by inimitable producer/director  Roger Corman, who had a hand in two of these features.

THE TERROR has a storied history. Corman utilized sets from a previous shoot that were scheduled for destruction in a few days. The aging Boris Karloff was brought and and all his scenes were shot in quick order. Exteriors and other locations (a good percentage of this movie) were directed by a second unit man. The end result is this film has a sort of dual personality appearance, and a somewhat confused storyline. Nicholson is good here as a French officer caught up with a transmogrifying bird and eccentric old castle dweller.

THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS has Jack in a memorable bit part as a pain-loving dental patient. Primarily, this is the tale of a flower shop employee and his pet flesh-eating plant. Corman's most popular film was one that he considered throwaway at the time, which is why it soon fell into the public domain. LITTLE SHOP's popularity and cult status continue to grow almost 40 years later.

THE WILD RIDE is Harvey Berman's only directorial job and stars Nicholson as an amateur dirt bike racer who spends his off-track time partying and getting into trouble. Originally 88 minutes, this one was long ago whittled down to an hour. Based on what remains here, little was lost on the cutting room floor.
