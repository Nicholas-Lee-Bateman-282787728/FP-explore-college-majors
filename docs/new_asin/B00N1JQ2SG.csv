6606805,2,B00N1JQ2SG,"Couldn't get past the critics darling, Greta Gerwig, whose ordinary-ness and complete lack of charm, grace and talent, she has managed to turn into an indie career. Unfortunately, she has allot to do, and pretty much brings down every scene she's in. You can just see the lines on the printed page every time she opens her mouth, and has the emotional range of a zombie. She reminds me of the plain Jane teachers pet in the high school drama club who somehow got all the leads. Despite a pretty magnificent performance by Al Pacino, I failed to see the humor in this sour account of a fading actor's last gasp. Could be, as an actor of a certain age, myself, it hit a little too close to home.",1422057600,6,693,4.37984496124031

Where is the entertainment, it certainly is not in the telling of the story, no matter how well you can develop a  disputable character, whether it is the  main character, or the people who take advantage of him.  Where is the redeeming value in telling such a story in film?

6606894,3,B00N1JQ2SG,"It is difficult to know what to think when this film ends, a great performance by Al Pacino, but not a great film. Pacino plays an aging actor, losing his memory in bits and pieces, probably little strokes,mbut who knows. He goes to a rehab after a breakdown, and comes home to recuperate.

A young woman, played by Greta Getwig, professor at a woman's colkepge, a lesbian, daughter of old friends, and a woman who has had a crush on Pacino's character for a long time, comes to visit. They ultimately have a relationship, she breaks up with her female partner, who us transgender, and assumes a romance with the man. The film goes from interesting to muddled to OK, but nothing to keep the interest for 90 or so minutes.

Great acting,that is the best that can be said.

6606925,5,B00N1JQ2SG,"It's interesting that a lot of reviews compare this film to ""Birdman"". It's probably because both films center on the theatre and have ambiguous endings though there aren't as many flights of fancy on display here.  If nothing else see this film for Al Pacino's masterful performance as Simon Axler, a once renowned actor who is losing his feel for performing and is contemplates suicide. After a stint at a mental institution he reconnects with Pegeen (Greta Gerwig), a thirtysomething lesbian who's burned the torch for Simon since she was a child.  Simon's relationship with Pegeen reinvigorates him but it comes at a cost.  Pegeen proves to be a selfish manipulative parasite who causes Simon more anxiety and complications than his fragile psyche can handle. On top of that Simon has to deal with Pegeen's disapproving parents and former lovers.  This is a carefully calibrated turn by Pacino of a man on the verge of emotional meltdown and he wisely dials it down.  Pacino could have howled at the moon as he was prone to do in previous roles but allows his raspy voice, age lined face and mournful eyes do the talking for him.  Gerwig is equally fine making a potentially obnoxious character not only palatable but somewhat endearing.  Good supporting cast but I'd give a special shout out to Nina Arianda as a woman who hilariously tries to contract Simon to kill her husband.  Last year Arianda distinguished herself in the relatively obscure ""Rob the Mob"" so here's hoping Hollywood is taking notice.  Director Barry Levinson expertly juggles the comedic and dramatic elements of the film based on a Philip Roth novel. Octogenarian Buck Henry co-wrote an acidly wicked script fifty years after he helped create ""Get Smart"" with Mel Brooks and contributed to ""The Graduate"" screenplay.  Which leads me to the question as to when they are going to issue on DVD Milos Forman's first American film ""Taking Off"" starring Henry.  I don't know if you can categorize any endeavor of Al Pacino's as a small film but ""The Humbling"" is an exceptional undertaking.",1426982400,5,2062,4.913544668587896

6606942,2,B00N1JQ2SG,"Simon Axler (Al Pacino) is an aged actor who has difficulty separating reality from his acting which appears to be senility, although he is institutionalized for the condition. Here he meets Louise (Kyra Sedgwick) a woman who claims her husband has molested her daughter and wants Simon to kill her husband for her. He played a killer in a film. Simon refuses, but Louise stalks him anyway. We the audience never know if the husband actually molested the child or if Louise has issues imaging the event.

While at home recovering, Simon is visited by neighbor and fan, a girl who has had a crush on Simon since age 8. Pegeen (Greta Gerwig) is also a lesbian (VW bug dead give-away) and throws herself at Simon and introduces us to some more odd characters.

The film has a number of long boring soliloquies by Simon. It takes a while to build things up in a plot that doesn't move much. Through many of the scenes, I got a feeling of Deja vu, thinking I had seen this in another movie before. I don't know if that was by design and shows us the genius of Buck Henry, or simply shows a lack of creativity. I felt I was watching a film desperately trying to be clever at the expense of the entertainment value. It was difficult to sit through.

6606943,3,B00N1JQ2SG,"The downfall of greatness, in this case an actor, is of course a fascinating subject, but this movie is not interesting. The screenplay relies on oddball characters, dream/delusion sequences, and of course that device so beloved in Hollywood, conversations with a therapist. Stuff happens, the scenes go on and on, but it's all so banal! To be fair all this crap is not terribly boring, though that's mostly due to the always watchable Pacino, the rest of the cast contributes nothing of value. Pacino is certainly pathetic as the doddering old actor, and indeed this movie is such a travesty that it's like watching the death of his real career on screen, but elder abuse is a crime not entertainment.",1425859200,,702,4.858333333333333

After a stint in rehab he moves out on his own again and is surprised when Pegeen (Gerwig), the daughter of someone he used to know shows up at his door. The two begin a friendship that changes into much moreor does it? Al Pacino has been my favorite actor for a long time now and anything he is in I am excited about watching. This is a type of character that he rarely plays, the only other time Ive seen him play someone like this is in People I Know. That said, this movie shows why Pacino is such a force. The entire movie keeps you guessing what is real and what is imagined. He does a great job of really making you feel the way he wants you to. Whether he is sleep deprived in Insomnia or slowly losing his mind in this one you cant help but go through the struggle with him. This is a good movie but it is a little slow in some parts. Much like the recent Birdman, you watch an actor struggle with his inner demons, and while its not a happy thing to watch you cant look away. Overall, Pacino once again proves why he is such a powerful actor. If you liked Birdman then watch this one. I give it a B.",1424995200,2,1211,4.0041322314049586
6606986,4,B00N1JQ2SG,"Its unfortunate that THE HUMBLING was released so close to the debut of BIRDMAN because this Barry Levinson-directed comedy/drama features the best film performance that Al Pacino has delivered in over a decade.

Both movies deal with an over-the-hill actor having problems distinguishing between fantasy and reality, and in the case of THE HUMBLING we, as an audience, are never quite sure which is which.

Adapted from Phillip Roths final novel, THE HUMBLING centers on actor Simon Axler (Pacino), who feels that he has lost his gift for acting and is contemplating suicide.  After a month in a mental rehabilitation center, he returns to his Connecticut home and, shortly thereafter, meets Pegeen (Greta Gerwig), a young lesbian who has the hots for this man who is old enough to be her father.  As their relationship progresses, other strange folk intrude upon Axlers life, including two of Pegeens former lovers, one of which has changed gender since their break-up.  Even more bizarre, however, is a woman who was a patient at the rehabilitation center where Axler had stayed.  Having seen the actor long ago play a Mob hitman in a movie, she now wants him to whack her husband.

 This entertaining, albeit sometimes confusing, film boasts a stellar supporting cast that includes Dianne Wiest, Charles Grodin, Nina Arlanda,  Dan Hedaya and Kyra Sedgwick.

 The Blu-ray from Alchemy includes a Behind the Scenes featurette.

6606991,4,B00N1JQ2SG,"I finally got the opportunity to see this film while it was in limited release in LA back in Jan. I must say that Pacino turns in his best feature film performence since The Insider (1999) or arguably Insomnia (2002).  Lately, over the past decade Pacino has focused more on returning to theater with a couple Broadway plays and two riviting critically acclaimed performances in the HBO films ""You Don't Know Jack"" (2010) and ""Phil Spector"" (2013). It is truly satisfying to see Pacino sink his teeth into the role of Simon in this film, an ageing actor who feels that he has lost the passion for acting and quite frankly is on the verge of loosing his mind and through an experience of an affair with a young lesbian tries to re invigorate himself with his craft.

 This was a passion project for Pacino and was independently financed for very small budget and it's unfortunate that this film wasn't able to find a broader release nationwide. It's also worth noting that this film offers some similarities to the more complete film Birdman which was released around the same time, but is still able to stand on its own as a compelling character study. One thing that I also liked about the film is its uneven tone, swinging from comedy to drama much like a lot of the Shakspere plays that his character plays in the movie, although this was what found most critics mixed about that movie. However, all of the critics do praise Pacino for his performance as it is the strongest point of this film and is definitely worth seeing.",1424131200,7,1528,4.589743589743589

This woman happens to be the daughter of Axler's old friends, and she also happens to be a lesbian.

The main problem with the movie is that it couldn't find the proper balance of comedy and drama, as well as most of the comedy falling flat. The movie also felt awkward, which may have been the point, but it was poorly done. The supporting cast (Dianne Wiest, Dan Hedaya, Charles Grodin, Kyra Sedgwick) are unfortunately wasted.

8675678,3,B00N1JQ2SG,"Possible spoilers.  Al Pacino stars as Simon Axler, a 67 year old actor who is struggling to remember his lines.  During a stage performance, he falls off stage and is sent to the hospital.  He has hallucinations and has a hard time understanding what is real and what isnt.  Eventually, his psychiatrist, Dr. Farr (Dylan Baker) suggests he spend 30 days in a rest and recuperation facility.  In one long monolog during one of those sharing sessions, Axler explains what hes going through.  This is classic Pacino, hair askew, frazzled and delivering good lines.  Unfortunately the rest of the film is hit or miss.

Axler moves into his Connecticut mansion, complete with its own pond, woods and heated swimming pool.  An early visitor is a 30-something woman who is a stranger to Simon.  It turns out she is Pegeen (Greta Gerwig), the daughter of former best friends Asa (Dan Hedaya) and Carol (Dianne Wiest).  Pegeen has always had a crush on Simon dating back to when she was 8-years old.  She hangs around, much to Simons surprise.  They talk, have dinner and share some laughs.

Simon, already a bit befuddled, learns that Pegeen had recently broken up with her girlfriend.  Yep, shes a lesbian.  Why? Because she is now a he (Billy Porter).  Pegeen decides to give old Simon a whirl, often with the help of a variety of sex toys.  In one of the funnier scenes, Simons housekeeper lectures Pegeen on how to keep her collection of vibrators properly maintained.

Barry Levinsons film, taken from Philip Roths novel, jumps around going from dark comedy to tragedy to drama, sometimes in the same scene.  There is also an unnecessary subplot involving a woman Simon met at the rest facility who wants him to kill her husband.  And then Asa and Carol insist that Pegeen and Simon not have a relationship.  Any guess as to why?  Pacino is very good here and given her characters proclivities, Gerwig does her best.  But this is just an average movie overall.  Not all that bad, but not really good either.",1466208000,,2005,4.72543352601156
