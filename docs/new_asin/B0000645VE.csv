8588120,4,B0000645VE,"There is an interview at the beginning & continuing at the end.  After the initial interview section, is old footage of at least 3 bo kata; Tokumini No Kun/Kon (not purely the Isshinryu), 1 with circleing the staff (perhaps as disarming) & overhead swings (perhaps keeping back incompetent opponents or mosquitoes).  I think the one in color may have been the Chatanayara No Kon (taught to a group, step-by-step, repeating with adding a new step on each time till the whole form was taught). Sadly, no sound but for the music.  May have been another in the faded footage but I'm not sure if it was different. Then a ""jo"" kata, a faded nunchaku kata, clear footage of Chatanayara No Sai (maybe a 2nd sai kata but probably same) & Matsu Higa No Tonfa. Lacking is ""names"" of the kata that should be posted before the clips. Otherwise, great historical tape, good at least for advanced kobudokai interested in seeing &/or learning ancient Okinawan kobudo kata.",1065744000,2,956,4.746987951807229
