8144537,4,B000I8OOQA,"it's actually quite a good movie... i like the ending: it's rather realistic and logical, very much within  the story-line",1515196800,,122,5.1
8144538,1,B000I8OOQA,The plot seemed shallow and the protagonist's role was that of a narcissistic person -a spoiled brat.  I just didn't care for such a plot.,1462752000,,138,4.52
8144539,3,B000I8OOQA,"The story of a young pretty girl who is unable to cope with life. She can't hold a job because she is always late and is fired. She is unable to pay her rent, unable to pay her utilities. She tried to bum money from anybody that she knows but inevitably runs out of options and decides to try her hand at prostitution where she is also a dismal failure. This is a very sad movie about a totally irresponsible young woman. It began well but midway deteriorated into a series of itimate sex scenes and essentially a porn movie.",1461024000,,525,4.26

8144541,5,B000I8OOQA,Good movie,1449014400,,10,4.5
8144542,2,B000I8OOQA,"Life is hard for an entitled, self centered, spoiled young woman who has alienated and ripped off her family and friends. The movie does convey an interesting and depressing sense of how difficult things were in Argentina during a major economic downturn. One positive aspect is the exploration of the difficulty of finding meaningful work and still managing to pay the bills. This challenge is perhaps especially acute for young women who want to break out of conventional roles and find their own way. The actress does a good job of portraying the panic and confusion experienced when their is no clear path forward.",1431388800,,618,4.951923076923077
8144543,3,B000I8OOQA,The movie is depressing but tells a realistic account of a young girl who lives on her own and loses her job.  She cannot pay her rent and her family and friends are tied up in their own lives and are no help to her.  She is one day away from losing her apartment and being turned out on the street and makes the snap decision to sell herself to pay the rent.  In one night her life is turned upside down.  The movie is filmed like a documentary and could have had a better ending but was worth watching.,1416700800,,504,4.01
8144544,1,B000I8OOQA,"Terrible movie.  No compassion for Paula.  She is entitled, self-centered, and selfish.",1413849600,,87,6.166666666666667
8144545,5,B000I8OOQA,"Great movie from Argentina! It's like a docu the way it''s filmed; the verisimilitude is outstanding, as well as this young woman's acting, that is, if she is really acting....",1405987200,,176,4.9
8144546,1,B000I8OOQA,"the DVD was in good shape but the movie was really bad: bad argument, bad cinematography, pretty bat sonography and even worst photography.",1239408000,,139,5.086956521739131
