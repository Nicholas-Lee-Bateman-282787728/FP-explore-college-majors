3996332,3,B002VKE1KC,"It's hard to give this long awaited DVD more than 3 stars. Thousands of fans anticipated the release of the 3rd season, the height of the entire series. This is the season when it became more than a teenage drama, a new and more mature story line began developing. Jude began writing stronger songs and discovered love triangle with the boy next door and the producer.

This season is BEAUTIFUL. The release of the DVD was rushes though. There's nothing but 13 episodes on a dual disk. The disk lacks artwork. The DVD artwork is barely even good. The back tries to mimic S1 and S2, but fails.

If Echo Bridge has any hopes of making more money, then they will release a bonus DVD with all the features this DVD lacked.",1264723200,6,718,4.431818181818182
3996333,5,B002VKE1KC,"The rating I give this set is for the episodes ONLY.

After waiting so long for this season to come out on DVD I was excited to see it available to buy especially at the decent price compared to the two seasons before. Once I got the set though I could understand the pricing.

The only thing on the DVD is the thirteen episodes. There is no on-the-sets, no minis, not even a special feature to view the performances on the own without watching the full episodes.

All in all if you want to buy it so you can watch the episodes on your TV and not your computer go ahead. If you want special features and don't mind watching it on your home computer or laptop, try iTunes their download of season three has all the on-the-sets as shown on the N.",1264636800,8,744,4.188811188811189
3996334,4,B002VKE1KC,"I absolutely LOVE this show.  I have to admit I am obsessed with it.  So, like any other obsessed fan, I was anxiously awaiting the release of season 3.  I couldn't wait to see the extras and all the special features.  I was totally disgusted at the lack of effort that was put into releasing this awesome season 3.  The show deserved much better and what about us, the fans?  No special features, no minis, no 3 disc set.  This is a 1 disc, front and back, season 3.  I am obviously upset about that. With that being said, I am happy to have the episodes on disc now so I can watch them whenever I want.  I gave this review four stars only because the show itself is fantastic. If I were rating it on everything else, it would get zero stars.",1264464000,,743,4.13986013986014
3996335,3,B002VKE1KC,"Before I start: I am using my mother's Amazon account to write this review. She is in no way affiliated with this review.

Instant Star first caught my interest because I fell in love with a girl. Her name is Alexz Johnson. Her voice, her looks, her charm, her overall pure awesomeness that just makes me melt when I see her. I purchased Instant Star season 2 DVD set without knowing what I was getting into, I just knew I had to see more of this goddess and her talents. After watching season 2 without seeing season 1 (I couldn't afford $40 to watch season 1 :-P) I just got hooked and needed to see more. Also, a pleasant surprise, Supergirl from Smallville played my love's sister! Two of the hottest women I've laid eyes on in one series! I was in awe.

Anyway, back to seeing more. I could not wait to get my hands on season 3 when it was released. I waited patiently. And then it finally came in the mail! I opened up the envelope to find what to my surprise was double-sided single disc inside a very uncreative DVD cover. I popped in the first side anyway.

The DVD menu was, for lack of a better description, uncreative, sloppy and generic. Maybe the description for that is ""it sucked""? I pressed play. The video quality at times was pixelated and jumpy. Very unprofessional. When it finally reached the episode titled ""Heart of Gold"", the video had a slight gray colored tint to it and the audio was fuzzy. It looked like something you'd find on a bootleg DVD. And with the lack of special features, I found this DVD to be not enjoyable at all.

I'd like the DVD producers to know that if they're going to release something that's being awaited by loving fans, they should put some money and effort into it. This could have all been avoided with a two-disc double-sided set with some special features.

Now, for my review of the season/series itself. To be honest, it didn't really strike me to be as into it as I was with season 2. The whole Tommy/Jamie choice just bugged me because obviously Tommy is NOT the right man for Jude. It's just infatuation with Jude/Tommy, not pure and true love like Jamie/Jude. Jamie's known Jude his whole life, he knows more about her and shares a special bond with her that cannot compare to Jude & Tommy's ""It's wrong, but I just wanna sleep with you"" so-called love. Yeah, Tommy got Jude's music back in her rightful hands, but c'mon. A trip to wherever that obviously Jamie couldn't afford to compete with was total BS. Jamie's got a compassionate, honest, true and undying love for Jude. That's all that should really matter. Tommy just ""loves"" her. O_o

Patsy's story was sad, but also kinda felt rushed into for the series' sake. That kind of made me more emotionless towards it.

The whole ""you killed-I killed-we all killed Angie"" story was one of the stories that got most of my attention. I also liked the twist at the end of it, it caught me off-guard.

Speiderman and Karma's marriage was just like a WTF-moment for me. Not like an OMGEE!!!1!-WTF moment, but more like a WTF-so ridiculous moment. Hope they turn out alright on MTV. *rolls eyes*

WHERE WAS LIAM??? OH MAN, I MISSED HIM!!! He was such a great character and frienemy for the show. I just cracked up everytime he and Jamie had a moment in season 2. It wasn't the same without him.

In conclusion, I liked season 2 waaaay more than 3 and can only hope season 4 is better. Only, I won't be buying season 4. No no, if I'm going to get bootleg quality for a paid DVD, Then I might as well just get bootleg quality for free off the internet.

Overall: Alexz was absolutely beautiful-looking in all of the episodes, but her songs weren't among my favorites. I could have waited until someone sold this DVD used for $5 if I knew it was going to be like this, especially when I'm strapped for cash.",1264377600,,3813,4.432857142857143
3996336,4,B002VKE1KC,"I am so excited to now have season 3 of Instant Star on DVD.  The only downfalls are that it is a double sided disc(more potential for scratches at least that's how I see it).  Half the episodes on one side and half on the other.  And I had to order it on the internet because no where had it.  The other downside is there are no special features.  It is worth it however because I now can just pop in the DVD and watch season 3 whenever I want, although like a cassette tape I'll have to flip it to the other side lolz.",1264032000,,520,3.914285714285714

3996349,1,B002VKE1KC,"The quality of the dvd is super spotty. To give you an example, this show was shot around 2004-2008 but it looks worse than a show (dvd) that was shot from the 80's. I wouldn't even say that this is 360 pixels. If your a fan of the show, this is only worth it of you want the packaging that it comes in just to look at on the shelf every now and again.",1445212800,,352,3.77027027027027

As for the show itself, it's a good teen drama with great pop music. A classic that should have lasted longer (unlike other Canadian teen shows *cough*Degrassi*cough* that have overstayed their welcome).",1392940800,,440,4.569620253164557

3996371,5,B002VKE1KC,"I love this show. It's always been a guilty pleasure on mine. I have enjoyed both watching the show and listening to the music many times over the years. Once you invest your time in this show, you will not be able to turn it off. You will surely feel a plethora of emotions, because it's funny, sweet, silly, and dramatic. Every single time I see it, I laugh, and I cry. It's that good. That being said, the acting is great, and most of the music is wonderful. To be forewarned, this is an adult and mature teenage show. I would not recommend this for children, preteens, impressionable people, or for anyone who is easily offended. In short, this is definitely worth watching and buying.",1380412800,,689,4.476190476190476
3996372,5,B002VKE1KC,"As a writer of novels for young readers, I watch random shows on Netflix, where I can find entire series to watch as noise while I write, while allowing me an ear into my audience. When this show came up as a suggestion, I checked it out and one thing stood clear. Alexz Johnson has an amazing voice! The show is a well detailed look into the life of a teen star and the challenges they might face. And through it all, the music is a constant plus. Unfortunately, when I got to the end of Season 2, Netflix had no more. So, I went to my DVD source, Amazon and bought Season 3 and 4 on DVD. 2 days later, Prime had it there. The story continues evolving, as Jude continues her struggles with life and love and the music continues to impress.

If you like the music, definitely check out Alexz's soundtracks, as well as her solo work, which she independently produces via crowd-funding.",1377388800,,884,4.325301204819277

3996378,3,B002VKE1KC,"Loved watching the 3rd season of Instant Star- so much drama, and Tommy and Jude on her 18th birthday= priceless. Until I got to the 10th episode and the Amazon website tried to make me pay again to watch it! I bought the entire season but at episode #10, it acted as though I hadn't bought it.  Not to mention Amazon.com on Roku and streaming PC is not nearly as user friendly as Netflix. User has to click through multiple screens to get shows started, the streaming freezes, and there is no option to continue to the next episode automatically. Add this to not getting all my episodes that I paid for- Amazon fail. I'm not buying anything else Instant View on this website- sticking to Netflix from now on. :(",1366848000,,712,4.435114503816794

I love the hangups at the end of this series, so you wanna see more, but it is very hard to go through the whole series to get into the end, as there are some stories and some episodes that are just tedious, unfortunately, as I love the show and the songs.

The one thing i didn't like was the lack of creativity displayed on the disc menu. there is nothing there that would even remotely make you think it's an instant star dvd, nothing like the first season.

the main reason i wanted to write this review is because this: I also ordered season 4 and for those wondering where the season 3 extra's went, they are on a disc along with the season 4 extra's that comes with the season 4 dvd.
