6456174,5,B00L16P1QU,"""A picture is worth a thousand words."" Jack Marcus (Owen) is an English teacher that has a slight alcohol problem and is in danger of losing his job. The school hires Dina Delsanto (Binoche) a famous artist that has her own struggles she is dealing with to teach art. What starts off as a harmless comment about words being lies soon becomes a war between words and pictures. The teachers drag their students into the battle which end up helping everyone involved. This is a perfect example of don't judge a book (or in this case movie) by its cover. Going in I was expecting a cheesy romantic comedy that has been done over and over. While this did have the romance aspect this dealt much more with education. Clive Owen plays a teacher that the kids love but the administration hates. He does things his own way and actually gets through to the kids. Binoche's character is angry at having to teach but still makes a connection with the students. The movie is a back and forth argument over which has more power words or pictures with great arguments for both sides. This movie has the type of educational influence that movies along the lines of Dead Poet's Society or Mr. Holland's Opus has. This is a huge surprise of a movie that I just can not say enough about. One of the better movies of the year and I highly recommend this. Overall, if you like inspirational movies about education then check this out. I loved it. I give this an A-.",1410048000,7,1444,4.473484848484849
6456175,4,B00L16P1QU,"Words and Pictures is a testament to the enormous value of quality acting.  The film stars the very gifted, very sexy duo of Juliette Binoche and Clive Owen.  They portray teachers at an elite preparatory school in Maine.  Once a popular writer, he is now an alcoholic whose life is in stasis, though he still tries to engage and inspire his students.  She is a revered painter who, sidelined mid-career by rheumatoid arthritis, agrees to teach an art course.  The film charts their courtship, a Tracy/Hepburn-style blend of barbed wordplay and slowly intensifying romance, as well as an academic feud:  whose artistic discipline is more vital?  The way this debate is shown to ignite spirited conversation and debate among the dreamy-eyed students is an example of an artificial, borderline stilted quality which restrains this film overall.  Its comfortable, crisp, white-on-white, so-New-England-it-hurts depiction of high school rings false, particularly during  a climactic assembly sequence.  Yet Binoche and Owen electrify.  Each expertly conveys the way a sculpted persona (the devil-may-care wit, the ultra-icy stoic) can disguise painful demons, and their sophisticated chemistry is hard to resist.  They obviously cannot transform this minor-key comic romantic drama into a masterpiece, but they significantly ease the burden.  It goes down smoothly.",1407456000,61,1361,5.548543689320389
6456176,5,B00L16P1QU,"I just left the theater and this movie is deeply imbedded in my heart.  It is right up there with my all time favorite movies.

6456177,4,B00L16P1QU,"I really would be interested to learn how this crazy movie got written, how it could come out of someone's imagination.  I call it ""crazy"" because having two middle-aged, unlikeable people with a volatile half-academic, half-romantic relationship doesn't sound like it'd make an endearing movie, but in this case, it does.  The first half is much more lighthearted than the second half, as an English teacher who is trying to keep his job taunts the new female art teacher in word games he comes up with.  He's kind of flamboyant, but in more of a Nicolas Cage crazy-person way with strongly articulated speech and aggressive arm movements than in a ""gay"" way.  This is the kind of role Nicolas Cage would have excelled at, especially in the 80s and 90s when he was playing people who don't fit in with society and react with strong aggression in personal interactions.  The female art teacher is icier than the English teacher and just as rude, both to the students and to him.  The crazy thing is that they show interest in each other by taunting each other, and the students enjoy that and don't mind their rudeness.  It sounds crass, but like writer-director Billy Wilder managed to do, the snide exchanges have a strange refinement to them, because of the wittiness and because a more substantial theme is at the heart of the movie.  It's helpful that the movie shows background reasons why both of them are unpleasant people, without which their rudeness would make the movie unpleasant rather than funny.

Eventually the story spins into a much more serious personal one, moving out of the territory of snide romantic comedy into the deep personal problems the male English teacher and female art teacher have.  I didn't enjoy the second half as much because the lighthearted style was replaced with much more serious relationship issues, and it was unenjoyable watching them make relationship mistakes such as trying to escape their troubles by getting into an affair.  I am glad, though, that the humor wasn't sexual and that in the big scheme of things, they both learn the hard way that you don't just ""try out"" a relationship and then quit it, but that you have to be willing to open your heart MORE THAN ONCE when you get hurt, or else you end up separating yourself from any meaningful relationship.  Relationships require vulnerability and commitment, the movie teaches, and then it brings the mood back to the lighthearted battle of words vs. pictures and resolves happily.

It's really got a flavor of its own, defying a genre or formula.  Few movies are unique in this way.  Overall, I like it a lot because they do learn the importance of commitment in a relationship, and I really enjoy the sophistication of their sparring as they taunt each other in a half-academic, half-romantic way.",1403395200,110,2807,4.81875
6456178,5,B00L16P1QU,"A big hit at the 2013 Palm Springs International Film Festival (I think there were three sold out screenings), its among the better films, if not the best film, Ive seen so far this year.

Director Fred Schepisis compelling melodrama about two teachers at a Maine prep school who battle each other and their own demons satisfies not only for the story but also because of the undisputed chemistry of the two perfect leads.

Clive Owen is Jack Marcus, an aggressive, gifted, honors English teacher who preaches the power of the written  and spoken  word.  For a while, he manages to hide his serious drinking problem that threatens to destroy his world.  When Juliet Binoches Dina Delsanto the new art teacher arrives, Marcus is energized and soon theres an open debate in the school about whether words or pictures have the greater power.  Its a battle between the dominance of the left and right brain.  Delsanto is already an acclaimed abstract artist, but she no longer paints because of painful, crippling rheumatoid arthritis.  But soon she is forced to paint again when the war between the two teachers becomes a school-wide event.

One of the most amazing scenes in the film is crippled Delsanto painting in a way that cleverly allows her to spread paint as she wishes on a large flat canvas.  (In actual fact, Binoche is an accomplished artist and what she paints in the film is her striking original art.)

Gerald Di Pagos original script is richly detailed and tight.  And it stays on track.  What a welcome relief to idiotically flat so-called romantic comedies like Adam Sandlers BLENDED.  Di Pago is a veteran screenwriter (he wrote the cult fave SHARKEYS MACHINE).  He was also a high school English teacher and understands the specialized angst of curious young co-ed students and self-satisfied, sometimes glib teachers ensconced in a semi-closed setting.  The world of the story rings true as does the push-pull fascination between the two teachers who we hope will somehow get together and find healing for the pain they experience.  Im giving nothing away here as that is the core question the movie asks.

If you like intelligent, adult romances, don't miss this great looking, emotionally satisfying film that massages both halves of your brains hemispheres.  Highest recommendation.",1403222400,217,2304,4.981675392670157

6456187,5,B00L16P1QU,"Mainly I selected Words and Pictures bec of Juliette Binoche expecting good acting  and a light romance. Words and Pictures was not either of those. This is an intricate feast for the eye and mind and heart. It has everything. It addresses and portrays teaching from both the teacher's and the student's point of view, including the board of directors. What we are capable if what we value most is on the line. It addresses and portrays making art, with a rarely seen intelligence, heart and soul, and even the pure visceral physicality of painting enlivened and in a more extreme focus bec the artist is handicapped. The writing teacher, once a writer too, is also handicapped. Aren't we all? In his case he is an alcoholic who has finely found the love of his life but his drinking tramples all over it. The artist's  painful rheumatoid arthritis does not dominate her work but has severely limited her life resulting in a nearly impenetrable moat around her heart. Both of these people care deeply about teaching and just as deeply about their art. I am a painter, a poet, and a novelist now and I have never ever seen the arts portrayed more truely and with such real depth. The love story is particularly touching as one gradually sees them finding common ground based on hilarious irreverant humor. I felt great chemistry between the characters either real or portrayed very realitically by two great actors. Highly recommended!",1521676800,3,1434,4.801619433198381

Too bad, too, because the story germ is brilliant. But the writer and director relied on cliches and focused more on the predictable romance than the words-vs-picture concept. There's the burnt-out, once-talented author (Clive Owen) who, SURPRISE, wears a lot of tweed and drinks too much.

I liked the characters, too, so it was easy to cheer them on when they faced difficulties. One of the best movies Ive seen in years. As for the PG-13 rating, I guess its justified by a few swear words and an implied sex scene (you don't actually see any sex happening, or even any nudity), but 98% of the film is entirely suitable for the whole family as far as naughtiness is concerned.

This movie though in parts perhaps a bit formulaic, weaves together wonderful words, storyline and art and sets the stage for a war, a showdown, between art and words. If you enjoy literature, reading, and you can appreciate the beauty and expressionism possible with a painted brush you will like this movie, at least I think so. Yes the two main characters have flaws, the writer battles an addiction to alcohol, and the painter has arthritis. The scenes where these characters interact are wonderfully scripted and the viewer sees the seeds of battle planted early on.  There is a flow to the movie at least for me that matches a rhythm between written verse and brush. I really enjoyed the picture, as it focused on people and relationships, and for once was a movie devoid of special effects. This is a Friday night girls get-together type of movie.  It reminded me a bit of Nicholas Sparks movies minus a death scene. Thankfully nobody dies. Enjoy.",1475020800,2,1067,4.7005347593582885

6456733,4,B00L16P1QU,Juliette Binoche was wonderful.  Clive Owen was fine in the role.  It was a reasonably intelligent movie for a couple of grownups to watch. Watching Clive Owen travel down a familiar (for movie goers) of alcohol induced destruction was almost too painful to watch.  Seen it too many times.  Hasn't he?  Then all of a sudden he can quit drinking on his own with a brief instance of participation in AA.  Too easy and too soon.  Fortunately came to a quick end.  Seemed like someone's term paper that never was properly graded when a little padding in some places and a little less predictability in other places would have made for a better movie.  Aren't there a million English majors out there that can write?,1456876800,,711,4.624

Clive Owen, whom I usually think is great, does not shine here, partly because the material doesn't hold up. Scenes are disjointed and pacing is strange. Situations with students and premise are unbelievable and tension never rises. Main character gets his way by badgering and being annoying, which the film seems to endorse as funny and cute. Resolves the problem of alcoholism too swiftly. Film's attempts to deal with racism among students fall far short of actually achieving its aim. Of interest here is Binoche's performance as a painter living and learning how to work with R.A.

But, the script is good, characters seem spot on, the acting is (naturally!) superb, cinematography is excellent, the atmosphere is pretty believable. I'm not giving it five starts because, well, because, maybe, I relate too well to Binoche's character: the artist afraid of losing herself and her identity because of a relentless disease attacking her joints. I suffer from osteo and psoriatic arthritis, rather than RA. But I have seen my own life change because of my defect.  The disease chose me, as RA has attached itself to the artist in the film. Life becomes a way of living with an enemy that cannot be destroyed. Binoche gives a wonderful, sympathetic performance. Clive Owen as the brilliant alcoholic English teacher seems to be doing what comes naturally - nothing about his performance seems contrived or forced.

Seeing each other beyond our hangups, learning to look over and around each others walls. Staying, no matter what. This is not, in any way, a fast-paced movie, but that's one of the things that makes it delicious. Even though Clive Owen is not my favorite leading man, he really grabbed me with his performance. I'm sure it helped that he was cast opposite the brilliant Juliette Binoche, whom I absolutely adore on screen. This one isn't for everyone, but it's definitely a movie lovers of literary fiction would appreciate - it's full of subtle nuances, and thought-provoking moments about human strength and weakness, and the tenacity of the human spirit, but you won't see anything a very modest bathing suit covers, and the only blood shed is an accidentally cut hand when reaching into a trash can.

6457264,5,B00L16P1QU,"Language in this film is playful, precise, lucent and absolutely delicious.  Writer Gerald Di Pego is a new icon for me.  Director Fred Schepisi is skilled and meticulous and still keeps it wonderfully natural and fluid. The two teachers at a Maine prep school , Jack Marcus ( Honors English) and Dina Delsanto( Arts Honors) are played stellarly by Clive Owen and Juliette Binoche. Clearly, the author is a virtuoso wordsmith and this piece is so tightly and beautifully woven, that few words are gratuitous. But words and word games are the setting, playground, where Mr. Marc both connects with his colleagues and students and hides from them. Word games take the focus off him and his affinity for alcohol, allow him to show he's still got it -- through his literary references, quotes , definitions, derivations, multisyllabic alphabet jousting.  It's so great.  When Ms Delisanto appears on campus, he peeks out from his hiding place again to play and spar with her . She's also been hiding in the open. She is called the icicle and rumor has it  that she caned a student. She denies that, sharply, adding that it was a teacher she caned. Her crippling rheumatoid arthritis is only her most visible vulnerability, and  as an artist, she has, so far, been dramatically limited in her ability to paint. Together, clearly attracted to each other, they play the advance and retreat game, culminating in a full on intimate and sexual  connection. But his demon drink comes out to play too, and she becomes disgusted and repelled. The backdrop for all this action is another game or competition to determine whose subject--words or pictures --is most valuable. The real challenge here is how each will gain mastery over his/her own deficits, and the outcome will be saved for you. For folks who love good repartee and some really good smart ass style, and could eat language with a spoon, don't miss this one.",1444694400,3,1908,4.8343558282208585

It was as if the writers were in a contest and, running out of time, scribbled out the last three excruciatingly terrible lines in 2 seconds to make the buzzer. Or they wrote them as a joke that they accidentally submitted instead of the real, eloquent and hearf-felt version and rushed off to begin writing their next screenplay, only to learn the embarrassing truth as they heard the farce of an ending uttered by the characters at the premier. Imagine the horror, in that dark movie theater, of hearing your masterpiece end that way--- with a mistake. Imagine being surrounded by an audience that laughed, cried and held their breath at all the right times, who wove their affections around the lead characters so masterfully-voiced and then blanked in a confused silence as the last three excruciatingly terrible lines were spoken-- and they were a joke! A silly pull of the pen over paper to make the cute copy editor laugh. Meant for the trash, accidentally submitted and approved. A flirt turned farce.

She is one French actress who has successfully transformed herself into a believable American.  Owen draws a successful portrait of a man wallowing in alcoholic self pity.

But I kept wanting to turn it off. I'm glad the romantic interests weren't perfect. Both characters were flawed, some not due to their own fault, but some yes. It deals with RA, alcoholism, personality flaws. . . But I think there were too many flaws to deal with. Too much going on in each of the main characters internally that it prevented them from really going deep enough into the issues with the students, or really creating more heightened drama about ""The War."" I would have liked to see Dena's tutoring of Emily. And overall this was just kinda boring. I kept wanting to turn it off, but I wanted to see them kiss again, so that's the only reason I kept watching (and I like Clive a lot).",1441670400,,863,4.366459627329193

Dina (Juliette Binoche) plays the part of the worthy opponent art teacher.  This movie will engage you in the argument of what is more important, words or pictures.

The ending just made me roll my eyes. I'm not sorry I watched it, but doubt I'd watch again (except I really REALLY like Clive Owen, even when he's not clean-shaven, and this role gave him a chance to show his ""sensitive"" lonely-self-destructive-alcoholic-screw-up acting abilities).

Honor English Teacher, something of a maverick, Clive Owen, enjoys tormenting his fellow teachers with Word games. New Honor Art teacher, Juliette Binoche is a match for him and they exchange words, insults and put downs until WAR is declared. Her challenge is to prove that a picture is more powerful than words and his challenge is to prove that words are more powerful than a picture. The students and staff become engaged and the final outcome is.......oh well I can't spoil it. Watch it for yourselves with your family and teenagers. Some cussing and one sex scene, but today's teens probably know a lot more about this than their parents' generation.",1439856000,,786,4.873134328358209

6458055,3,B00L16P1QU,"A slow romantic movie based in a small town between an English teacher and arts instructor. It is for a change romance between two matured adults a one with a physical impediment and another a alcoholic. The lead pair has done an excellent job with certain scenes reaching intensity a movie like this deserves. I particularly liked the scene where Clive owen tells his son how sorry he is for failing him.

The war between words and pictures the clash some how does not feel like a competition it is meant to be. The romance seems a bit tepid and chemistry lacking between the lead pair. I loved the poem used in the movie a lot

He was quirky, so intellectual and convincing as a passionate man that took his career and life very seriously. Writers in particular face times of despair when the brain doesn't prove itself and the creative down-times can be devastating; but he works so hard and overcomes so many obstacles. The chemistry and 'war games' between he and Miss Dina were magnetic, funny and loving. What a departure for him from his violent, turbulent gutsy roles to a somewhat parallel persona in 'Words and Pictures"". English and Art Students in High School and Colleges all over the world should enlighten themselves to this delightful teaching motion picture novelette and come away more astride in their ability to communicate every faction of their lives more deeply.

I have taught in a private high school, and believe me, if I had acted as unprofessional as Jack, I would have been long gone.  Teaching is more than knowing your subject matter!  Plagiarism in any form is not to be tolerated, especially in an English teacher.  Very unrealistic.  On a bright note, it was good to see a lead character with a chronic health issue.  I loved the contrast between her expansive art studio where she really painted, as opposed to Jack's rundown house where he did nothing professionally.

This low budget film shot in Canada grossed just over $2M and at its widest release was only in 66 screens. Not enough people have seen it and I hope it's rental life is long an prosperous.  Very simply put...an art instructor (Binoche) and an English teacher (Owen) form a rivalry that ends up with a competition at their school in which students decide whether words or pictures are more important. Although not the freshest film to come along, the performances of Owen and Binoshe make up for for what the film lacks in originality. It is, nonetheless, a charming and worthwhile hour and one half.

Worse things could happen in film, and do, trust me. I'd watch it again. Love Juliette  Binoche and have throughout her career. Love Clive Owen who's proven very versatile.

6458779,5,B00L16P1QU,"I loved this story. Clive Owen plays the part of a divorced and gifted honors English teacher who battles alcoholism. His addiction has not only threatened his career as an exceptional teacher, but has put a wedge between him and an adult son he loves dearly. When a new art teacher, played by Juliette Binoche, arrives on scene, he is drawn to her and it motivates him into a debate with her about the power of words versus pictures or paintings. She too has a cross to bear. She's crippled from rheumatoid arthritis and is on medication for the severe pain. A relationship blossoms with pitfalls along the way. However, there is levity sprinkled throughout the story that will make you laugh. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone else, so I'll end by saying grace and redemption are important factors in this heartwarming story.",1435708800,,836,4.6938775510204085

6458800,4,B00L16P1QU,"This movie seems like an entire script was created around a preachy message someone desperately needed to get out of themselves. This is the best way to fail at creative genius. Nothing makes me want to kill myself like preachy messages. I don't drink but I felt bad for anyone watching who does. Clive Owen carried the movie with his sexiness and brilliant acting abilities. Somewhere in the making of this movie they decided that the story was so weak they needed to pretend the intended audience was teenagers all along. I wish I had known that in the beginning but there was no indication of intended audience. There really needs to be a ratings system for intelligence level. This movie gets an IQ65. I would have loved this movie at age 14. Except for the ending. What the heck were they thinking with that cliche ending? I was not embarrassed for either of the actors until that point. I couldn't even look up from my facepalm to see if they were kissing after that predictable spontaneous laughter. If the last one minute of the movie was rewritten to ANYTHING the movie would gain 20 IQ points.

Five FASCINATING Stars! Word and Pictures is about 2 teachers of some renown in their respective fields of literature and painting, and their deepening interrelationship, both at their prestigious prep school with students and faculty and on a personal level. Marvelously and humorously portrayed by Clive Owen and Juliett Binoche, both are at individual crossroads with health, career, and personal issues and both gravitate towards each other, until problems occur in their relationship. The movie is also about 'obsession': with words and pictures and the competition that develops at the school. This movie had several opportunities to go darker but the writers thankfully stayed on course. There are excellent supporting performances by Bruce Davison, Navid Negahban, Amy Brenneman, Valerie Tian, Janet Kidder, Keegan Connor Tracy, and others. Directed by Fred Schepisi. Highly Recommended as a romantic comedy with realistic roots. Five ENJOYABLE Stars! (Lionsgate. Rated-PG-13, Color. HD. 111 minutes)",1435190400,,1026,5.75

I appreciated the flaws that each of the main characters dealt with, for themselves & with each other; and how they were inspired by each other to be better people, despite the other one's flaws... that they accepted they weren't perfect, but instead works in progress.

I love romantic moviesthis movie was not just the run-of-the-mill girl meets boy, falls in love; it had substance which showed what you do and how you do it can make a difference to others, especially teachers. This country needs more teachers that can engage their students to THINK, to feel, to strive beyond the just-get-by mentality and strive to excel and grow. Highly recommend Words & Pictures!",1420588800,,727,4.635658914728682
6459289,3,B00L16P1QU,"Potential spoilers.  I didn't know much about this film but with Clive Owen and Juliette Binoche in the lead, decided to take a flyer.  Owen plays Jack Marcus and one-time semi-famous writer who no longer appears inspired.  Wow, how many movies start with that premise?  He takes on a job as an English teacher at an exclusive prep school somewhere in coastal Maine.  He's single but has a grown son (Christian Scheider) he rarely sees.  Oh, and he's an alcoholic.  The students kind of like him, because he's funny and often profane.

Jack's stride is altered when another famous artist (painter) comes to the school.  Binoche plays Dina Delsanto whose work has stalled as she has developed rheumatoid arthritis.  And yep, she's single too.  So with these 2 attractive adults without mates, it doesn't take much of a leap to think a romantic or at least, sexual entanglement will come to pass.  But not right away.  In fact, Jack begins to bully Dina and challenges her to a contest for their students.  Which has more power, ""words"" or ""pictures.""  I liked the two actors together and a bit more byplay would have been nice.

Instead we get too much of Dina struggling with her ability to paint.  She's forced to invent various mechanisms as she has limited range with her hands and legs.  She even comes up with a contraption involving a mop hanging from the rafters where she swings around on a chair on rollers.  Who hung that thing anyway?  And it looked to me like all that maneuvering would be more painful than just drawing with a brush.

Once the pair get together in the sack, complications ensue.  Not the issues of Dina's fragile body.  Somehow they get around that.  But remember when I said Jack was a drunk?  That!  Again, how many times do we see the alcoholic screw up a good thing?  So is redemption in the cards?  Take a guess.  The film is predictable and has some lame writing, especially for Jack, but damn if I didn't like it.  Mostly for the overall theme about the ""arts,"" be it writing or drawing and how they often complement each other.  I also liked the chemistry between Owen and Binoche.  Both a bit unsuited for this film, but they sure look good together.

So how are the ""pictures"" on the Blu ray?  Excellent.  This movie really shines in this 1080p transfer.  The aspect ratio is a wide 2.40:1.  Colors are terrific both inside the school and houses, but the late spring setting of Maine looks great outside as well.  Great detail on clothing and the artwork.  Flesh tones are excellent.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is also very good.  The film doesn't really lend itself to great dynamics but the dialog is clear and easily understood.  You will get some surround involvement with some ambient sounds and of course, the musical score.  Subtitles are available in English, English SDH and Spanish.  Extras include a commentary with Australian director Fred Schepisi, a behind-the-scenes short and a trailer.",1420588800,,2963,4.692007797270955

6459293,5,B00L16P1QU,"Gerald Di Pego's script for WORDS AND PICTURES deserves to be published as a book, so sensitive are his musings about art and literature. This film is filled with some unforgettable thoughts that should challenge teachers of writing and art and their students as well.

Fred Schepisi directs this lovely little film with restraint and sensitivity, allowing the brilliance of the performances by Juliette  Binoche and Clive Owen to shine. Though the school kids are a bit cookie cutter and thwart the momentum of the film at times, the overall response is one of pure pleasure in the drive of the story.

A flamboyant English teacher Jack Marcus (Clive Owen) and a new, stoic art teacher Dina Delsanto (Juliette Binoche) collide at an upscale prep school in Maine. A high-spirited courtship begins and she finds herself enjoying the battle. Another battle they begin has the students trying to prove which is more powerful, the word or the picture. But the true war is against their own demons, as two troubled souls struggle for connection - Jack is a chronic alcoholic who has distanced his son and Dina is an artist hampered by the insidious progression of her Rheumatoid Arthritis. The banter of battle is one of words in a game that is fascinating to all: the tenderness of their mutual needs sculpts the poetry of the script. Superb acting, excellent script, Oscar deserving recognition for many concerned in this refreshingly nuanced film. See it and memorize it. Grady Harp, January 15",1420329600,,1492,4.936254980079681

6459330,3,B00L16P1QU,"Juliette Binoche and Clive Owen are two of my favorite actors so I was eager to see them together. Binoche has aged gracefully and always lights up the screen. Binoche and Owen are together as teachers in a wealthy private school. Jack Marcus (Owen) is a troubled alcoholic whose brilliant way with words is fading. In contrast, Dina DelSanto (Binoche) is a brilliant painter whose talent is being destroyed by a physical disability. Needless to say, the two collide at the school as Marcus starts a war between words and pictures. Is it the written word or an artistic painting that better tells a story.
The ""war"" motivates and inspires the students to do their best and yes, the idea is lovely but so much is lacking in this story. Except for one bad seed student, the rest are decent and behaved, if just unmotivated. The big conflict is Marcus and his alcoholism that could cost him his job. Is it any surprise that Marcus is interested in an indifferent Delsanto who is aware of his ""issues.""
We've seen this story play out in so many movies. There is no surprise in the path the romance between Marcus and Delsanto takes or how the war ends. This film is so well-intentioned that it is sad to see an inspired story and a great cast wasted. It rates just an ""OK"" in my book simply because of the gorgeous scenery and seeing Owen and Binoche together.",1418342400,,1356,4.538775510204082

6459425,4,B00L16P1QU,"I read reviews of this movie online and most of them were not so favorable.  Personally, I liked it.  One of the online reviews felt that many of the scenes depicting the behaviors of the main characters were too repetitive.  I was intrigued by the way the artist was resolving her challenge and coming up with a way to paint successfully and was more focused upon that than analyzing it for repetition of scenes...and the English teachers way of dealing with conflict would have been repetitive...he was stuck in a downward spiral and dealt with his everyday challenges in the same way.  I have known alot of different kinds of people in my life and I saw these characters as believable.  Not all of life is cutting edge.  I enjoyed the comparisons of words vs. art being the most effective way to communicate.  Truthfully, one is not better than the other...the manner in which an individual processes and relates to life impacts upon the effectiveness of how a concept or message is received by them.  I think this movie relayed that message.  I may not have enjoyed the movie as much had a seen it in a movie theater but it is a good stay at home, late at night or rainy (or snowy) day movie.",1415059200,,1196,4.5

6459537,5,B00L16P1QU,"What makes a teacher more than interesting? Passion - and these two bring this to their students, and each other, in spades.  Clive Owen (as Jack Marcus) and Juliette Binoche (as Dina Delsanto) bring an emotionally charged chemistry to their pairing quite easily along with a snappy banter that ignites the flames even further. Director Fred Schepisi takes a brilliantly written screenplay by Gerald Di Pego and applies it to faculty, teachers and students in an all consuming debate between the importance of words and the necessity of pictures.

Jack Marcus, or Mr. Marks, as he enjoys being called is on fire as the English teacher in their elite prep school in Maine.  He has a great rapport with his students who seem to hang on each word he uses although the faculty is not impressed with his overall performance as a teacher.  Unconventional ways of making students interested to the point of being enthusiastic about attending his class has earned him a great place concerning literature and words, although not necessarily with how the school would want him to act. He exudes an overflowing love of the English language and the literature thereof that it is easily conveyed to his extremely attentive students. Being an English teacher and former writer, he challenges that words alone are the first and foremost path to greatness.

Dina Delsanto is somewhat walled off emotionally and nicknamed, ""The Icicle"", especially at first when she begins to teach her students.  She appeals to feel their artwork right in her heart, in her emotions, not only the viewing of it.  She is a tough cookie while having a class of fresh eager learners.  There are definite standouts in the film including, Emily (Beverly Tian). She is the shy student of both teachers enthused over each point of view as Mr. Marks declares ""War"" on Ms. Delsanto's point of view, that words lie and pictures are the path to greatness.  A distinct situation concerning Emily and another student is important to this story also bringing a disturbing reality but then a reinvigorated student in her.  Both teachers present intriguing theories for each side, can quote many famous people to back each position and are both eager to defend their personal standpoints.  It is their passion for never quitting and following through their personal pain that makes you cheer for the teachers and students.  A clear adventure in learning and growing through instilling the love of the creative process drives this story forward.

What is so personally wonderful about each teacher is that they have an obstacle of enormous struggle that they must constantly overcome.  The writing for these situations of both teachers is done so amazingly well that it never insights pity but incredible admiration for being able to overcome the obstacles in their way.  With both having these intense personal issues only serves to aid them to challenge the other as they are alike and different in equal ways.  They also are challenged in the romantic realm as there is a growing passion for each other as everything else in the school gets so intense, so do they.  The students are written with perfection and exclusive detailed portrayals that are so very real for their particular age group.  They are more than eager to learn and are affected by the happenings of the competition in the bang-up ending presentation.  An interesting point of discovery is that Juliette Binoche uses her own paintings for the film.  She presented her own works of art for the film and they are quite beautiful and have challenged Binoche to move forward in her own private direction.

6459549,5,B00L16P1QU,"Hard to know where to start with Words and Pictures as they are indelible intertwined. Jack is introduced to us by pouring vodka into his thermos. While initially only giving that a passing glance, we get the full scope of a destructive path when it escalates, illustrated by lone liquid lunches in the car. In spite of that shortcoming, his challenging word games are a motivational disruption for others to be more creative. The picture side of this, what is initially and aptly named 'artificial war' is Delsanto, a fine arts teacher simultaneously introduced to us, the school and of course, Jack. He immediately engages her in his word games. She holds her own, tough and resilient, repeatedly illustrated by various manifestations as we get to know her better.
They both have creative pasts, now being driven by their desperate passion to relive those fabulous times. He was a published writer while she was an acknowledged painter both now thrown together into a competition which thrives in motivating their students to become more accomplished. As inspiring as they may be for their students, both have been driven to accepting complacency due to their limitations: his alcohol and her physical deterioration which includes prescription drugs.
Jack's inebriation continues to worsen, adding more drama to an already thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining plot fully endowed with a great script. He reaches a trough when the confluence of his addiction leads to events including damages to her painting and the escalating alienation of his son.
Finally he acts to resolve it, no more hiding behind definitions and deflecting reality with word games. She takes on nature's cruel debilitating disease, rising above the malaise of the recent past to create again at a level to match her own very high standards. They inspire each other to reach their personal pinnacle.
The casting is perfect, the script superb and all the sub plots geared at resolving the personal demons driving them both - and oh yes, as well as resolve the imaginary war of words and images which truly compliment each other. We move from crude drawings on cave walls to words which attempt to describe art in its highest form. Movie making at its finest.",1412467200,4,2231,5.032432432432432

It was much more like a ""serious romantic comedy."" Two prep-school teachers, one in Honors English (Words) and other in Art Honors (Pictures), have immediate chemistry -- arguing about whether words or pictures have a greater meaning and influence. Their arguments motivate the students in both subjects, and you see a little bit of growth in some of the students because of it. But the main focus is on the teachers, and some of the students are a little unbelievable as real people. In particular, I was a little surprised that some teenagers could be THAT obnoxious, and I was a little surprised some other teenagers could be that affected by someone else's actions. So the students where caricatures, as you'd see in a RomCom. But there were real struggles (alcoholism, rheumatoid arthritis) of the adult characters. So it did have drama aspects there. Sadly, the ending felt forced -- even these two talented actors had a hard time pulling off the RomCom-like ending. It might have been a better growth story if things didn't end as well as they did.

The relationship between the two was compelling enough, and they both did a great job with that part, however once Clive got to the Jefferson/JFK/MLK mahsup, (Yes, author of the script rips off great speeches like a bad hip hop artist  samples others' music), it was too much and we had to stop.

The soundtrack, the writings, the art and the performances featured here are indeed entertaining and offer a cathartic experience as well. If you've lived some you will have an opportunity to relate to the honest explorations here. I gave it 4 stars because, though it resolved believably, for me the resolution was too brief, too off-hand, too forced. Another entertaining and reinforcing scene or two would have gone a long way to balancing these characters and to making this a better film. I do recommend it. But let me suggest that you give yourself enough time after watching Words and Pictures to enjoy some more beautiful music and another glass of wine. Then your reflecting will be on cruise control.",1410825600,,1001,5.22360248447205

6459638,2,B00L16P1QU,"Two good actors perform well in clich ridden film. I was expecting clichs from the description of the film ""art vs. language.""  However, with Clive Owen & Julliette Binoche are such good actors that I was willing to take a chance. However the film writers had to trowel it on: he has lost his ""inner fire"" and hasn't written in years and has become an alcoholic; she still has the fire but has RA and her body can no longer even hold a brush. Gag. I ended up using the fast forward button many time during this film because watching the clichs unfold was just too painful to watch. Do what I did & borrow it from the library, don't waste your money.",1410652800,8,649,4.276422764227642
6459639,4,B00L16P1QU,"Clive Owen and Juliette Binoche make a marvelous team, chemistry is there, but in this film the chemistry is the better part of valor. They both play aging artists in their own fields, relegated to teaching at a prep school. Juliette plays Dina Dagastino a popular artist, afflicted with Rheumatoid Arthritis that affects her painting skills, now teaching Honors Art. Owen, Jack,  is a former writer/poet, an alcoholic, teaching Honors English. Both are superb in their teaching and in their craft.

Dagastino, known as a cold woman without emotion, believes words are lies. To Jack, this is not acceptable and charges Dagastino and their Honors students to  a match. This is what enlivens the school and the couple. Such a well acted film, both actors so believable in their roles. Why this did not make the mainstream I guess is its romantic interlude.  The ending is a disappointment to me, but the film held up well.

6459647,5,B00L16P1QU,"Astaire and Rogers.  Tracy and Hepburn.  Burton and Taylor.  Allen and Keaton.  That's high praise but ""Words and Pictures"" is a throwback to a time when romance was between mature adults and not overgrown adolescents engaging in nonsensical foreplay before jumping in the sack.  Our protagonists are two artists who both suffer debilitating illnesses but refuse to surrender.  Jack (Clive Owen) and Dina (Juliette Binoche) are the ultimate odd couple but it's these very differences that infuse their debate and ignite their passion for one another.  Same passion and friendly competition ignites the minds of their young pupils at the toney prep school where they both teach but it doesn't feel clich.  Owen and Binoche have that kind of kinetic chemistry here that fuels both their verbal duels and their lovemaking that recalls a bygone era.  They are also impressive here in the scenes where they tackle their impediments, Jack is an alcoholic and Dina has rheumatoid arthritis.  You don't pity their lot but cheer on their resolve.  The kids in the film are very natural and you don't feel you are watching children acting like adults and vice versa.

They are WONDERFUL together, adding piquant wit and intelligent banter.  This film feels more like inspired drama than comedy but its a close call.  Delightful and painful in turns -- but always in a good way -- showing the raw pain, vulnerability, insecurity, beauty, and warmth of the human condition, relationships, and how human beings grapple with the grit of Life.

Acting was superb!! I've followed Juliette Binoche's work for quite a while, so I knew it would be good!! A work of art, actually!!! And of course, Clive Owens brought panache, but to be honest, I hadn't thought that he'd bring as much depth to the character as he did. Pleasantly surprised, enough so to say that I'd definitely buy the DVD!!!!!

There are several plot lines, which are intertwine and bring interest and resolution to the story. The writing is honest, and the dialogue is not only fascinating, but captures your attention from the beginning and doesn't let you go. Overall, excellent!!!",1410307200,3,833,4.777777777777778

6459652,5,B00L16P1QU,I give this a 5 star because of teachers who believe and love what they teach and the influence that can have on young students. 5 stars for those who struggle with afflictions and  what they [the actors in this movie] did to overcome or deal with problems.  I don't remember the last time I watched a movie where the storyline of  two character's left such a positive effect on so many others.  It was also wonderful to see how these two were drawn together because of admiration for the influence over/with the students each of them saw in the other teacher.  5 stars for the art!

8663010,4,B00L16P1QU,"Another reviewer wrote that this is a full brain movie. I like that analogy. It brought me memories of English classes that were really about the glories of the English language, the awareness of how writers draw pictures with their words. And then there is the art side of the movie which is about, well, pictures. Is a picture worth a thousand words? Are pictures inadequate to express what one is truly feeling, can words do a better job? The movie is sumptuous with both words AND art and I enjoyed that.

I didn't find the romantic side of the movie that appealing. I wish in a way that the screenwriters could have achieved the beauty of this movie without that part. Clive Owens' character is a toxic personality in many ways. The type of person who had probably destroyed as much as he uplifted. Yes, in this particular vignette he is charming, witty, challenging to the brain, brings one to an awareness of how we are truly feeling. But at what cost to the people who have gone before this film? Or am I taking it just too personally? Which is why I gave this film 4 stars instead of three because a good film DOES challenge us, makes us think of where we are at emotionally, artistically, mentally. In the end, I enjoyed it and it made me think about my own life. So all good.",1527206400,2,1286,4.4033613445378155
