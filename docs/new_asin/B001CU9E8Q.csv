8289755,5,B001CU9E8Q,"""Death Road"" refers to a 90-mile stretch of a trans-continental road in Bolivia, beginning at La Paz (its capital), and then heading to a 15,500' peak and downhill from there.  Grades reach 14 degrees, sections are covered in clouds, blind curves abound, and widths are as narrow as 10' feet - all with sheer cliffs at the edge of the gravel road. Making matters much worse, the road has heavy truck traffic, and commercial drivers work up to 20 hours/day driving.

Uphill traffic has the right of way.  Some sections have local volunteers that act as traffic directors, sometimes receiving tips.  Engines lose about 3% power for each 1,000' of altitude - thus, at 15,000'+ engines have only about half their power at sea level.

About 150 people die each year on the Death Road, mostly in bus accidents in which the vehicle crashes over the side.  Retrieving individual bodies can require as many as 20 rescuers.

Construction took place over nearly 100 years, often limited by funding, and at one point utilizing nearly 300 Paraguayan POWs.

The good news is that a new road is being constructed to replace Death Road; the bad news is that it is considerably behind schedule and over budget.",1224633600,,1193,4.785365853658536
