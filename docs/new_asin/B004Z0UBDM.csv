8449163,5,B004Z0UBDM,"Wonderful wonderful wonderful series of lessons from the Bible in American Sign Language and speaking. Songs, scriptures and great lessons that children can relate to. LOVEEE THIS!!! We're a hearing family but my daughter and I (2 years old) are learning ASL. We're a Christ following family so, this was a huge jackpot find for us. You will LOVE it!
