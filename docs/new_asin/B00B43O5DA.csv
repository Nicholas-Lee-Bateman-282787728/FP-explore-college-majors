8562211,1,B00B43O5DA,"I  have  never  really  cared  for  the  movie.
None  of  it  really.
Marc Singer  is  a  terrible  actor  in  this  movie.
Its  got  one  thing  in  common  with  (Masters  of  the  universe)
The  majority  of  the  movie  is  done  in  a  city.  All  the  acting  &  scripts  are  in  a  city?  How  Stupid!
The  Bad  guy  claiming  to  be  related  to  Dar  is  just  a  ridiculous  plot.  All  they  ever  do  is  chase  him,  The  bad  guy  is  just  boring.  In  this  movie  there  are  no  sword  fights  like  in  the  first  movie.  The  first  20  minutes  of  the  movie  are  fine.  After  that  you  may  as  well  give  it  up.
&  basically  has  absolutely  nothing  to  offer  to  keep  viewers  who  think  this  movie  is  a  good  movie  entertained.
This  sequel  shouldn't  of  been  made.  I  have  seen  it  in  the  past.
&  I  remember  liking  it  alright.
Now  I  don't.
If  you  want  my  advice  do  not  buy  this  movie.
Dar  isn't  the  same  as  he  is  in  the  first  movie.
The  first  one  I'd  watch  any  day.  &  I  do  mean  any  day.  Marc  had  a  little  more  to  give  to  the  viewers.
They  should  have  just  made  the  movie  to  where  Dar  goes  &  finds  out  where  Maax  &  the  Jun Horde  originally  came  from,  &  his  confrontation  with  them.
I  think  that's  what  viewers  would  have  wanted.  The  script  would  have  been  so  much  better.",1504396800,,1411,3.9541666666666666

8562213,5,B00B43O5DA,I wish I could get it on dvd along with a movie call The Quest which came out in the 1980's 1986 I think it was?,1441152000,,112,3.3461538461538463
8562214,4,B00B43O5DA,Audio English 5.1 Dolby digital. The video is a direct transfer of VHS.,1407542400,3,71,4.538461538461538
8562215,3,B00B43O5DA,"""Beastmaster 2"" is one of the most belated sequels of all time and like it's partner-in-crime sequel ""Highlander II"" goes against the tone and rules established in the cult classic original. Due to this tone shift and disregard the film has garnered a small but loyal fan base over the years that have clamored for a DVD release. I am happy to say that the film was released on an official Region 0/NTSC DVD but don't get your hopes up...

The DVD release is from Eagle Home Entertainment and leaves a lot to be desired. First off all the DVD was released under the radar in India and poorly distributed so it is EXTREMELY hard to come by. If you are like me and are able to hunt a copy down then the second problem is the transfer. All looks good at first with great cover artwork with a slipcover (featuring the artwork seen here on the amazon DVD page) and a beautiful silver pressed disc (unlike all the MOD DVD-R output by today's major studios) but this is deceiving. The transfer is nothing more than a full frame VHS transfer, a VHS transfer that has some damage towards the end of the film. Also the only special feature to speak of is English subtitles for the hearing impaired.

This is not the DVD release fans have been begging for over the years but look at the bright side as it beats the hell out of buying a wore-out VHS ex-rental and transferring it to DVD-R yourself or waiting for the tape to die a slow death. It may be only a VHS transfer but it's better than nothing for the moment and I encourage fans of the film to hunt the DVD down, just know what your in for before you purchase.",1376006400,12,1607,4.3003300330033
