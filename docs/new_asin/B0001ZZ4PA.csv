2050136,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"a collection of the early years,i laughed and laughed and a bonus with the 25 year re-uniun",1151798400,3,91,4.411764705882353
2050137,2,B0001ZZ4PA,"The Little Rascals collection is a set of 5 DVDs with a few shorts on each DVD, the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars. This set was poorly put together, the shorts included are quite random, and buying this set would be a waste of money.

Each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters. First there is Alfalfa, then Buckwheat, Spanky, Darla, Porky, Mickey, Stymie, then Fatty- oh wait, no that is Joe Cobb only they didn't know his real name, then Farina, and last Phil MacMahon- WHO you may be asking? Phil MacMahon, the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in Our Gang Follies of 1938. Still don't know him? Maybe that is because he wasn't a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection.

Disk One features the shorts Dogs of War and Derby Day. Dogs of War is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the Hal Roach lot; it is one of my favorite shorts from the series. However, it seems that they ripped off the Cabin Fever print and added a worse score. Derby Day also seems to be lifted from the Cabin Fever series. It is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races. The films themselves are very good.

Disk Two features a rarer silent film called Stage Fright. It is a film about a show put on about Marc Anthony by the kids in front of their parents. It is a total disaster. Just like in Reunion in Rhythm, one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry. The film has been seriously cut; there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length. The print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted. The music is much more childish than normal silent Rascals scores, but it works. There are sound effects too. Sundown Limited is a great short about the gang building their own train. It is a very cute film; Farina is especially funny in it. The train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood. The print is washed out and the music sounds just like Grapevine Video's soundtracks. The film titled The Pirates in this set is really called The Buccaneers. It is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship. When it sinks, they find a real one to destroy. This short has also been cut; there is no opener for it either. It is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it.

Disk Three opens with Mary Queen of Tots. It is a really enjoyable film where Mary receives toys that look like the gang. She dreams they come to life, and when she wakes up, she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life. This print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made DVD set. It is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though. The Fourth Alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters. The print on this one is not bad at all. The last film is School's Out, a talkie featuring a different cast. It is a film featuring Miss Crabtree, the new teacher. The picture is good; it seems to be the one from Cabin Fever.

Disk Four begins with Bear Shooters. This is a less than great film. The print is great; it is the one from Cabin Fever. Our Gang Follies of 1938 is a great film, very funny, long, and exciting. It features the later talkie cast. Waldo's Last Stand is a film from the later MGM years, a lesser film that seems forced. It was also released in a 5 part Rascals set.

Disk Five is the extra features DVD. It starts out with a segment from the You Asked For It television show. On it, some of the silent gang are reunited. Joe Cobb, Jackie Condon, Farina Hoskins, Johnny Downs, and Mickey Daniels are featured. The documentary called Kid Stuff really doesn't have a whole lot of information about the gang although Jackie Cooper is mentioned and Butch Bond does an interview. Other child stars like Jackie Coogan, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, Roddy McDowall, and Ron Howard are focused on as well.

The films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain. Many of them have been available cheaply for years. The only reason a fan might want to see this collection, the same reason I bothered, was to see the rarer silent films. However, the rest of the set is trash.",1133136000,40,4326,4.300613496932515
2050138,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"I have always loved the Little Rascals as child and as an adult.

I introduced my three children to watch and the loved it too, their ages are 8 and 11.",1121040000,4,152,3.903225806451613
2050139,3,B0001ZZ4PA,"The other reviewers for this product have no idea what they are talking about and are not true fans of the OUR GANG series. Just because you haven't seen the characters before, or because they are silent doesn't mean they aren't any good. That's just plain ignorance. If all you care about from the OUR GANG series is Alfalfa and Spanky, then you have much to learn about being a true Little Rascals fan. You might as well stick with the crappy 1994 remake while you're at it.

This collection has some VERY RARE silent classics of the original gang, including the classic baby Farina, who is arguably a much more adorable character than Buckwheat. People don't realize how amazing it is to have these gems restored the way they are in this collection. The collection of films in this DVD are hilarious and fantastic! This is for the TRUE Our Gang fan only. I would give this DVD 5 stars if it weren't for each disc being an hour long and for the unnecessary fifth disc.",1118361600,30,970,4.480225988700565
2050140,1,B0001ZZ4PA,I loved these guys as a kid. This collection sucks!!! Don't BUY It! The first 3 DVD's are silent and the 5th DVD is a reunion show. The grand total for shows you can actually watch is 4. Take your time and search out the specific shows and characters you love and get them individually. If I could get my money back I would RUN to the nearest post office and return this item ASAP!!!,1118275200,18,383,4.12
2050141,1,B0001ZZ4PA,"I agree with most of the reviews here.

I also grew up with watching the re-runs on Sunday mornings as a kid, and so when we introduced a VHS rented tape to my daughters they loved them. The ""talkies"" are the only films I'd consider buying and I think most people would only want as well. There was 1 DVD missing (we had two #5 DVD's)and missing the Spanky gang #4 disk. Right now we only have 1 original ""talkie"" and the rest documentaries and silent movies. I believe the company who produces this DVD set should be ashamed of themselves. They plaster Spanky's images all over all the videos and then we don't even have one of him!!!!!!

DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO (unless you like silent movies and bad documentaries) with film qualities that were bad copies (that are hard on the eyes!!!!

We're taking this one back and damanding a refund!!!",1111276800,17,841,4.4480519480519485
2050142,1,B0001ZZ4PA,"I am a Little Rascals fan, I watched them all the time when I was growing up. They don't televise the re-runs any more and I wanted to introduce my children to some of the wonderful and funny shows I watched as a kid. I was so excited when I saw this DVD collection but was very disappointed after viewing it. I found the description of contents given on the box to be somewhat misleading. The movies on disc 1 and 2 are silent movies with characters I've never seen. Disc 3 has two silent movies and one that actually had sound with some of the characters I was used to seeing. Disc 4 had sound, contained more of the characters I grew up viewing and was actually pretty good, disc 5 was more about a reunion with the characters along with information on other child stars from back in the day. If a slightly broader description would have been given stating that the majority of the movies were silent films and that only approximatly 4 of the movies not discs, had the actors Alfalfa, Darla and Spanky in it, I would not have purchased them. During the time I was a child and watched the Little Rascals, it always had sound. I never knew that some of their films were silent, it would have made a big difference in my selecting this paticular collection. It would have been nice to have this information disclosed in the description on the packaging.",1104192000,49,1353,4.394422310756972
2050143,1,B0001ZZ4PA,"Like the reviewer before me, I too was very disappointed in this dvd. The clips that have sound are terrible. Most of the clips were from the silent film era, and the players were unfamiliar to me. There was one clip with Alfalfa and Spanky that was fun to watch, but the majority of these clips was awful. No effort was put into digitally re-mastering and transfering the picture and sound. I could have done just as good of a job transfering these clips using just a VCR and a DVR. Don't waste your money on buying this disc. It is a shame, because with a little effort these clips could of had much better quality and it would have been more fun to watch these vintage clips.",1101081600,153,678,4.3046875
2050144,1,B0001ZZ4PA,"Well, I wrote the review about this set, and boy was I disappointed when I got it.  I see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters.  1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection.  The transfers are terrible and the sound is worse.  Come on guys, at least try to put some effort into it!!!  I got the set, watched it< and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use.  What a waste of money!!!",1090281600,147,561,4.148148148148148
2050145,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"I remember getting up Sunday mornings and watching the little rascals on T.V. as a kid.  I'm 31, and I still enjoy the madcap stories of Spanky, Alfalfa, and Buckwheat.  In a society where rude language and and nudity reign supreme, a little good clean fun can still make us laugh.",1089590400,,281,4.490196078431373

2050177,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"This is the second collection of Our Gang that I have purchased, the first being ""The Little Rascals Collected Edition: 88 Complete & Uncut Episodes"" (see my previous review) which was very good. I'm ecstatic to report that this collection is superior in every way imaginable.

To begin, the episodes are complete and uncut. All of the edited material hacked out back in the early 70's has been restored. Although this was true of the other set, each show was slightly cut trimming out the opening and ending credits. Not so with ""The Little Rascals: The Complete Collection""; it may be a minor point to some, but I prefer having the shows as close to perfection as possible.

Secondly, the episodes are presented in chronological order. This is sadly lacking from many other sets which are thrown together haphazardly, or in a ""best of"" format. Being able to watch the children grow from toddlers of 3-4 to pre-teens of 11-12 is rewarding in itself, not to mention the added enjoyment of observing the differing Rascals groups form and develop. It's quite noticeable in the Farina/Stymie/Buckwheat progression, as the outgoing Rascal tutors his new ""replacement"" coming in. Also, Spanky's childhood is effectively captured on film, and we watch him mature from precocious infant to mischievous child to charismatic young actor within 10 years or so.

Finally, unlike other versions which are extremely bare bones and without extras, this collection is loaded with special features. The first seven discs contain the 80 ""Our Gang"" Roach Studios talkies, each disc with a brief introduction from someone involved with the series. Sometimes it's an actual Little Rascal, other times a producer, writer, etc. Throughout these 80 shows, 3 feature full audio commentaries, which are quite interesting and informative. The final 8th disc contains many extras, all excellent. Mini documentaries on the Roach studio atmosphere and racial relations are two of the best included. But the greatest special bonus is the inclusion of 3 early silent films of the Rascals in action.

FINAL NOTE: read through these reviews and you'll notice a LOT of complaints about this collection. Sadly, they are valid BUT only for the original offering from the company. The sets available now contain updated discs without flaws. If you decide to purchase a currently offered collection, you'll be fine, no problems to be found.",1508025600,10,2402,5.119897959183674
2050178,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"sometimes something seems so obvious, it's hard to believe it not only had to be discovered, but actually set a precedent when it was. today, filmmaker Hal Roach's notion of ""kids being kids"" sounds about as radical as to suggest swallowing your food when you finish chewing it, but as it happens his career predates Leave It To Beaver by several decades. in the earliest cinema, child characters tends to be not only misleadingly non-mischievous, but were usually such ineffectual by-standers that they were more like props than performers.
one afternoon, after a particularly frustrating session attempting to cast just such a watered-down child part, a bushed Roach happened to glance at the lumberyard across the street. a group of kids were picking out sticks to play with, and there was the inevitable dispute over who got which stick, despite the fact that one stick was/is pretty much the same as another. despite the obvious juvenile nature of this little skirmish (you'll doubtless remember such things from your own childhood), Roach got so caught up in the spectacle that 15 minutes just whizzed by. it occurred to him to do films about actual kids doing actual kid things.
the inspiration was pretty bold, because conventional wisdom (or as conventional as it could be for something that was 20 or 30 years old at most) frankly doubted that real-world kiddie hijinks could be filmed without lapsing into chaos, that kids could ""carry"" a film (even a short subject), and/or the kids would have the work ethic to do the job even if they could. even Roach himself predicted that the concept might be good for half a dozen installments before playing itself out.
well, there's quite a gap between half a dozen and the 220 episodes that followed. only one other Roach Studios property had anything even remotely resembling the same staying power, namely Laurel & Hardy.
one of the earliest challenges was finding a title. Roach doubtless never guessed what a can of worms this would be, that having sold his first title, Our Gang, would necessitate a rechristening when the he offered his own films for television syndication in the '50s.
the series effortlessly captured the innocent shenanigans of childhood almost from it's inception. it may seem to of gotten off to a shaky start, though, because the times they were a-changin'. we begin with episode no. 86, their first ""talkie."" after several years of silents, the series had to adjust it's formula for sound. it was somewhat hit-or-miss for the first handful as the kids test the new waters and determine how best to utilize a sound format.
another thing that might catch you off guard is that what turned out to be the iconic ensemble - Spanky, Darla, Alfalfa, Buckwheat - came together fairly late in the game. (they begin to arrive about a third of the way into this compilation.) they had a number of predecessors, whom we encounter at first. as it happens, the single most famous actor to serve as a Roach Rascal was one Jackie Cooper. best known to my generation as Perry White opposite Christopher Reeve's Superman, Cooper is one of the very few who managed to build a viable post-Rascals career. (indeed, Robert Blake is the only other one that springs to mind.)
how much so, you ask? a kid named Farina is said to of been the single most popular character at the time, the longest lasting as well as the highest paid. well, needless to say, Farina has since faded into the shadow of Spanky & Company, and is all but forgotten today. how's that for The Fickle Finger Of Fate?
it's infectious brand of childlike wonder and subsequent mischief filled what some today would be surprised was a void. the precocious kids we take for granted in more recent tv series more or less germinated under Hal Roach's auspices. and somehow they managed to do so with becoming the sort of cloying brats or saccharine wads of cuteness that have since made child-actor a dirty word to some.
the series could be controversial on racial grounds. black characters like Stymie, Buckwheat, and the aforementioned Farina (who's basically a prototype Buckwheat) are sometimes criticized these days as the sort of stereotype that has since become a hot-button issue. the important thing to remember is that it wasn't considered malicious at the time. in fact, America was still largely a nation of immigrants, so cultural diversities of all sorts were regularly cited and embraced by comedians. in particular radio, where all you had to work with was your voice, thrived on what came to be known as the ""dialect programs."" (this was the age of Amos & Andy and Lum & Abner, after all.) so maybe it was less than flattering or ""politically correct,"" but it wasn't racist because it wasn't mean-spirited.
in any case, the racial angle for which Roach really caught heat at the time goes to the other end of the spectrum. what was then known as Our Gang was one of the first productions to display people in general, let alone children, of racially diverse backgrounds as friends. he even had the temerity to show his black and white kids in school together, at a time when many (just about the entire South, for instance) would've regarded it as one step removed from cannibalism. a number of installments would be subsequently edited if not banned altogether in certain municipalities, but Roach stood his ground. he knew he was showing a truth about how one's race is a moot point, and he wouldn't be silenced about it!
besides, it's easy to completely forget the issue if you let yourself. as with any series, you almost forget about such first impressions as you come to associate characters with their quirks and foibles. you notice that Buckwheat is black the same way you notice that Pete is a dog, and it doesn't take long to see what little it really has to do with whatever's going on.
but alas, it couldn't last forever.
in the late '30s short subjects were becoming regarded as more of an appetizer than an attraction in themselves. the Roach Studios, which did shorts exclusively, inevitably suffered, and Roach found himself having to sell his stars off one by one. when The Rascals came under that chopping block, the bid went to (cue shiver down the spine) Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. having served as their distributor for several years, MGM had what children of more recent generations would call ""first dibs.""
i'm not sure if it's quite fair to say the series went all the way downhill from that point. (for one thing, two iconic characters, lozenge-needing Froggy and Robert Blake-to-be Mickey, were introduced in the MGM era.) but it's true nonetheless that the series would never again be the same.
film historians will tell you that MGM, despite a sterling record with pretty much everything else, wasn't really geared for comedy. that's a little hard to believe given that they've since given us (to name but a few) Some Like It Hot, The Pink Panther, This Is Spinal Tap, and Spaceballs. for that matter, even then you could point out films like The Thin Man to argue they weren't completely hopeless.
it would be nearer the mark to say that they weren't sure how to deal with already established auteurs. the most infamous example, after all, is the way their meddling destroyed Buster Keaton's career. although ironically, the all-time champions of cinema comedy, The Marx Brothers, saw their careers reinvigorated by their association with MGM. the difference being that Metro's ""boy genius,"" Irving Thalberg, got what the Marxes were made adjustments rather than alterations. the two films they made under Thalberg's auspices, A Night At The Opera and A Day At The Races, were the most commercially successful of their careers as well as two of their finest.
it was Louis B. Mayer himself who screwed everything up here. it occurred to him if something appeals to kids, it should probably educate as well as entertain them. but alas, this was a few decades before Sesame Street figured out how to make that work. the lesson-to-be-learned was invariably clumsy and heavy-handed, and almost never managed to seamlessly gel with the comedy which was the draw in the first place.
take ""Three Smart Guys,"" for instance. Mickey, Froggy, and Buckwheat (pretty much the crux of the remaining gang at that point), opt to go fishing instead of to school. advised by a man they encounter that ""the greatest fish of all is success, and the bait is education,"" they drop everything and hightail it back to the classroom. it just doesn't ring true that such a corny analogy, so pompously delivered, would inspire such a prompt return to the straight an' narrow, does it?
another, ""1-2-3 Go!,"" is so overbearing with it's auto/pedestrian safety moral that it notoriously forgets to be funny. not fails to be funny, but actually makes little or no attempt to produce any mirth and/or whimsy.
while not nearly as infamous, MGM took another wrong turn that could only hamper the series. where Roach & Company saw this sort of thing as an art form and took it seriously, it was so trivial to Metro that they ended up using the series as a sort of training ground for up and coming producers, directors, etc. so in effect it went from being a professional production to a sort of film school.
well, everyone has their ""off days,"" i guess.
the good news is, The Little Rascals glory days, their original legacy of fun for fun's sake, are readily available for you to see and enjoy. what's more, there's an easy way to tell 'em apart. once Roach rechristened his own The Little Rascals, the title Our Gang became effectively exclusive to MGM's desecration. on dvds, tv/netflix listings, what-have-you, the words ""Our Gang"" are the red flag to be wary of.",1505606400,2,9697,4.821128451380552

2050198,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"The Little Rascals (actually The Our Gang Comedies) were some of the funniest and most memorable shorts of the 20's and 30's. Hal Roach's brilliant idea of filming kids being kids has never been duplicated or surpassed. Like most series that go on too long the series deteriorated into a mere shadow of itself in the later years.

While many of these shorts have seen their share of video releases most of them have been pretty shoddy. The Cabin Fever 21 VHS set was the best seen at the time with 84 total shorts including four silent shorts and all 80 of the original talkie series. The quality of these shorts ranged from good to very good all things considered. Edited? It's difficult to tell sometimes if there are edits with these shorts as they run anywhere from 25 minutes to 10 minutes (give or take). I remember Washee Ironee having an edit, but it was later fixed on VHS.

When this 8 DVD box set was released in 2008 fans were excited because it was said that the shorts would be unedited and restored. Unfortunately, the release did not live up to these promises and fans were very vocal about their disappointment. White the set was hardly a bust, it did not deliver the restoration we were hoping for, sloppy editing and the use of 13 Blackhawk title cards only added to the outrage as the original title cards were available for use on the set.

Fast forward a few years and while I am late to the party on this, I wanted to give an update on this set. The distributor has changed hands a couple of times, but the first reissue was with Vivendi Entertainment, who righted a few big wrongs on this set, first off, they replaced the Blackhawk title cards with the original title cards, it also appears that the shorts look slightly better too. These shorts are from the 20's and 30's and good care was not taken when storing these treasures. I never thought the shorts looked bad, but because Genius Entertainment raised everyone's expectations with the restoration promises it was only natural we were all disappointed with the results.

Here's where it gets a bit confusing, the set has changed hands a couple of times (Cinedigm is the current holder), but the set is still sold in the original packaging from Genius. (to save money I assume) The only difference is the original 7 volumes now have a photo of Pete the Pup on them, not individual various Photos of the popular gang members. The bonus disc included still says Genius Entertainment when you load the disc, but the other discs all feature Vivendi Entertainment during the intro.

I have watched the entire box set and while my first disc was defective which Cinedigm quickly replaced.  The others all played perfectly and I am happy to say this is a very good set, the shorts are presented in more than adequate condition and do not appear to be edited. I'm sure there are a few seconds missing here and there, but not for inappropriate politically incorrect nonsense.

The shorts are presented in production order which is great. The only down side to that is we get to watch the series deteriorate right before our eyes. For me, the series goes way down hill after disc four (once Spanky's puffy hat is replaced with the beanie) The Jackie Cooper shorts with Weezer, Mary and Stymie are probably my favorites with the Farina, Joe & Chubby and the Spanky & Dickie Moore shorts a close second. The series never captured the innocent, raw humor of these early shorts in the later years. Most the the classics shorts were directed by Hal Roach and Robert McGowan, Gus Meins took over in the mid 30's, disappointing style and tone changes were immediately noticeable, Gordon Douglas took over towards the end of the original run and are by far the weakest in the seres.

Oddly enough, the shorts most of us remember from TV in the early 60's were the mid 30's shorts which starred Spanky with the beanie, Scotty and later Alfalfa, Darla, Buskwheat and Porky. While these were hardly great, they were far superior to what the series would become when Hal Roach sold the rights to MGM. The shorts were more polished, but polished doesn't necessarily mean better, gone were the spontaneous feeling of the originals replaced with hammy acting and too many musical numbers. Though I must admit, The Love Bug Will Get You, if You Don't Watch Out"" and ""Learn to Croon"" will forever be etched in my memory. Overall, while memorable because we saw them so many times back in the day, the later shorts are a complete bore. The good news is the studio went from 20 minute shorts to 10 minutes during this time.making them tolerable. I really don't think I could have sat through these later ones at 20 minutes each.

There are a few bright spots in the later shorts, but they are few and far between, Spanky who was once a favorite quickly got on my nerves as he grew up. Porky was a terrible replacement, Buckwheat, well it's Buckwheat, he never seemed out of place, but he (and sometimes she?) was a far cry from Farina and Stymie who were top notch favorite members of the gang.

Addressing racial issues on these shorts, I wasn't alive in the 20's and 30's, but being a child of the early 60's I was alive when things were still wrong in this world. I never felt the Rascals were malicious in any way and I don't think the kids involved or the people making these shorts were doing anything mean spirited. It was a sign of the times and if anything Our Gang Comedies made us all color blind if even for a short time. I never looked at the gang members in terms of race, I only knew I wanted to be part of this gang. I have my favorites as much as anybody, Farina, Stymie, Spanky (early years), Jackie Cooper, Mary Ann, Dickie Moore, Weezer, Chubby and Joe in no particulate order will always be at the top of my list of favorites.

The extras and bonus disc are a little disappointing, the commentaries start okay but run out of gas half way through each of the three (during talkie shorts) and the two during silent shorts. The three silent shorts included here Dog Heaven, Spooks Spoofing and Barnum & Ringling Co. are different from the four Baby Brother, Derby Day, Dogs of War!, Cat, Dog & Co. included on the Cabin Fever VHS set. I also remember two more silent shorts being released in Our Gang Comedy Festival #2 they were titled Giants VS Yanks and Boys will be Joys. Its frustrating to wonder why some sort of deal couldn't have been made to include all 9 of these existing silent shorts on this set. The feature-ette is about 30 minutes and is okay, but I remember a two hour documentary titled the Our Gand Story that was released on VHS  and DVD that would have been a great addition here. There are some on screen memories from surviving gang members and a small piece on the racial aspect of the series.

Gripes aside, this may be the best set ever produced of these shorts and I'm pretty pleased with it now that the original title cards are all in place. I can only hope that sales of this set raise again making it a possibility for a future more extensive restored set in the future. If they can come anywhere near what has been done with the Chaplin shorts and films I'd be willing to plunk down the doe for the improved set. If you're an Our Gang fan and have been reluctant to buy this set, don't hesitate, it is by far the best set available.

Please note, there are still original sets of this being sold by major retailers which do not have the new discs in them, you can not tell from the outside as the packaging is exactly the same.",1495497600,,7529,4.486131386861314
2050199,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"As a child, I was a huge fan of The Little Rascals and bought nearly all of the Cabin Fever VHS sets that were offered in the mid to late 90's. I rediscovered these VHS tapes recently and decided I wanted a nice, neat collection of the shorts on DVD. I knew I would never find an ABSOLUTELY complete collection, but when I found this set, I was excited!

It has been so many years since I've seen these fantastic shorts--and in some cases, there are many I've NEVER seen cause they were never released to commercial video & removed from television circulation due to questionable content. So, as far as the shorts on this collection, the humor holds up extremely well! The storylines are fun and showcase the Little Rascals' talent. Unlike many modern child stars, the kids are cute, charming & funny--and not precocious & annoying.

The AUDIO & VIDEO are serviceable on the earliest shorts. Some of the sound is a bit muddy due to the source material, but nothing that takes away from the enjoyment of the films. The AUDIO & VIDEO greatly (and quickly) improve as the shorts move forward. Especially in the Spanky & Alfalfa years.

If there is some odd belief that your old VHS tapes are far superior to this set, that is simply NOT the case. This is a GREAT set for the casual fan or obsessive fanatic of The Little Rascals. Hope this helps!",1495238400,2,1343,4.495901639344262

2050214,5,B0001ZZ4PA,I guess I would start by saying this is probably one of the greatest series on television in the history of Television considering the time that it was put together. However they are saying is only 80 episodes or as it was called back then shorts when in fact there was 220 shorts that were produced of little rascals & Our Gang. There was a total cast of the entire series of 150 actors and actresses including 41 children. Which produced  child  actors as young as two years old  some who could not even read . Almost all of the children grow up  to be old age  with the exception of Alfalfa who was murdered at the age of 31 . This was a show that I believe we all watched as children if you are at least over 40 years of age that is. It is a clean cut non-violent television show that showed America that blacks and whites could work together. And in fact Buckwheat was the very first black African-American to have signed a contract that was considered long-term.,1491696000,,968,4.2967032967032965

2050218,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"I bought another collection that came in a green box.  HORRIBLE!!!  The episodes were blurry and looked like they were meant for VHS or old standard TVs!!

Then I read about this one.  Boy am I glad to have bought this one.  The episodes are wonderfully transferred. Although there was one episode, one of the earliest ones, (which I had never seen before), that was distracting 'cause the picture kept jumping.  It was weird, but with the more memorable episodes, they were fine.  So, apparently, this collection has episodes that you may never have seen before.  I think they arranged them in chronical order.  Which is why the earlier ones didn't have Spanky.  They had Jackie, Stimy, Ferrina, Joe, Chubby, Mary.  Later one, Spanky, Darla and Alfalfa, Buckwheat were the main draw.

If you are looking for a great collection, I recommend this one.  Another great collection is the ultimate Three Stooges collection.  Now that one was done so beautifully.  It was hard to know that these were back in the 30s'",1488672000,,1011,4.796511627906977

2050242,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"((((I have added an AWESOME UPDATE to the end of this review))))
LETS SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT!  A lot of people are posting false information about this set (The Little Rascals - The Complete Collection) and constantly raving about the 'Cabin Fever' Little Rascals release (that seems to be made up of fuzzy memories).
First - This set is pretty good.  All of the shorts are presented in what appears to be the original production order.  The picture is much better than the film prints that are used on a lot of the older VHS releases (cleaner, a lot less crud on the picture).  They are never going to look perfect.  They were made in the 30's and didn't get the care of the other 'Our Gang' (the original pre-TV title of the series) shorts that MGM retained the rights to. The sound is not really that bad for early sound films.  I can understand everything clearly and my hearing isn't perfect and I don't have a $3000 TV.  The picture DOES NOT have excessive cropping.  I compared it to other releases.  If your TV or DVD player tends to have a lot of overscanning, then it might appear that way to you.  The contrast looks the same as the much talked about Cabin Fever set (unless your equipment is faulty) The prints (with the exception of the Blackhawk sourced prints - which I'll get to in a minute) ARE the SAME RHI ENTERTAINMENT prints that were used in the old ""Cabin Fever"" set.  When played side by side, you get all of the same 'damage' on the film... It is identical.
The Problems with this set:  For some reason, 13 Blackhawk Films prints were used instead of the prints with the original theatrical titles.  (Blackhawk Films is/was a company that sold 8MM & 16MM film prints to libraries and for home viewing).  At least one of these Blackhawk prints (Hide and Shriek) is massively out of sync (the sound and picture do not match up).  (Vivendi has reissued all of the discs from this set, except for the bonus features disc.  They have replaced all of the Blackhawk prints with RHI ENTERTAINMENT prints.  These discs are super inexpensive and the same quality as the discs in this box set, but with the 13 substandard prints replaced.)
ALSO, people have complained about 2 of the shorts being edited.  ""Washee Ironee"" is not actually edited, but it appears that there was an error during the digital mastering that caused about a 4 second skip in the video.  The scene where the skip occurs makes no sense now.  It is irritating.  When Vivendi reissued the discs, they were unaware of the problem, so the error is on the new discs too.  People (who are probably just repeating things that they have read) keep saying that ""Bear Shooters"" is edited, but no one seems to know what is missing.  I have compared various prints and cannot find anything missing!  (If you know what it is and have actually seen this footage, please let me know.)  The Cabin Fever version is identical to the version in this box set.  The Blackhawk print has different repairs to the film from the RHI copy, so there may be 2 to 3 frames missing here and there (that's a fraction of a second... no missing dialog).
NOW, to briefly mention the Cabin Fever release of the Little Rascals shorts.  It is talked about as if it is the definitive copy of the series.  Well, it's not...  There were 21 one volumes released on 21 VHS tapes -or- 4 Box sets of Laser Discs -or- 6 DVDs (the 6 DVDs only contain the first 12 volumes.  The DVD release was never completed).  The shorts are not in any kind of order.  Each volume had a super brief intro from Leonard Maltin (a popular film critic and film historian) and (at least on the VHS tapes) an ad for the Little Rascals Book.  I haven't checked out the Laserdisc set, but the VHS set is mediocre quality (VHS doesn't even support full standard definition resolution).  The Cabin Fever DVD set is not as clean as this new box set.  Maybe if you own an old style -or- small screen TV, it looks fine.
IF YOU WANT THE DEFINITIVE SET, well, there is never going to be a set that will satisfy everyone.  WHAT YOU COULD DO is to buy this set, then buy Disc 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 of the reissue discs released on the Vivendi label and swap them out with the matching discs in this box set (same exact discs except for replacement of some of the lower quality prints).  Then find a disc with ""Washee Ironee"" on it that wasn't mastered from the RHI ENTERTAINMENT print.  Then you'll be fine....
Of course, if you are going to do all of that, don't forget to get the rest of the Our Gang Sound shorts in the box set from MGM.  ...and hope for a good box set of all of the silent films/episodes.
---> EXCITING UPDATE!!!!
I just bought another copy of this box set from W--LM-RT (for less than $10 dollars) with the idea to swap out the old 'Genius Entertainment' DVDs (that contained some Blackhawk prints) with the updated/corrected versions of the discs released by Vivendi.  WHEN I OPENED the brand new package, I found that the new lower price set (in IDENTICAL packaging) already contained all of the updated discs.  The bonus disc still says Genius Entertainment, but the other 7 discs say Vivendi Entertainment and have the 'Pete the Dog' Artwork!!  :D
WHAT A DEAL THIS REALLY IS NOW!!  As far as I can see, there is no way to tell if you have the updated box or the original box without opening it and looking at the disc art.",1464134400,89,5356,4.4279877425944845
2050243,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"Lots of hate for this collection. Not sure why. These are the UNCUT, uncensored and full collection of the Our Gang collection. Some episodes, haven't been televised since the 1950's!!!  This is by far the best collection out there, and while I do understand that people are complaining about the quality, but I'm actually thinking it's just fine.  The original shorts that were made in the 1920's before they were called the little rascals are a bit rough especially the first ones, but as I remember, that's how they looked when I watched them in the 70's and 80's.  They are completely watchable and acceptable in my eyes. They probably could have been cleaned up a bit more, but the later ones when Spanky, Darla, Buckwheat and Alfalfa are in the later shorts in 1930's look significantly better than than the 1920's shorts. Again, I will not complain. I've been waiting for about 20 years to get a DVD collection. I had the VHS collection and I finally gave up on VHS, so it was just a waiting game.  This is one of my favorite shows of all time as a kid and I'm so glad to see them here and uncut, and even saw some scenes I never saw on TV anymore.

Keep in mind, these were recorded in a totally different time and there is some things that will shock you, possibly. In the earlier episodes, I'm not sure how safe or proper the animals were treated, but they seemed to be downright abused at times and I sometimes had to cringe on some of those scenes wondering if the animals were okay after doing the filming!  Dogs, chickens, cats, etc.  And it wasn't just the animals! Very young kids getting harsh spankings, kids using guns,  overdosing on medicines and abusive parents whacking them when misbehaving. It makes you cringe sometimes, but ya know, that was the world.

You''ll never see kids doing some of things you'll see them do here, but again, different era.  The show mellowed out over the years and I loved when little Spanky was introduced. Considering how young he was at the time, he was an amazing actor right from the start and I fell in love with him instantly!  You'll love every single minute he's on screen and thankfully he stayed with the Gang till the end.

This was during a time when Blacks were considered inferior but you'll never notice with the rascals.  NO, they were all friends onscreen and off screen from what I heard and read .I don't think they knew or even cared about race nor did they notice, to see Buckwheat and Spanky mesh perfectly they were on-screen, I just loved how race was no an issue, nor did the producers think so either!  I believe the series was years ahead of its time in race relations and when you saw Farina and Stymie in action, you knew it was going to continue to be great. As you watch the Rascals, never was race an issue to these kids; they seemed pretty much color-blind to the color while the adults might have treated them how the real world might have at that time. However, looking back on these films with today's ""color-conscious"" eyes, some scenes seem racially stereotypical. At the time, racial and ethnic jokes were not uncommon. The writers thought nothing of including watermelon jokes and the like. None of these scenes are malicious, and are actually quite innocent. Before these DVD's came out, I did notice some scenes that were cut and you'll see them that might have been considered completele racist when these were re-ereleased in the 70's and early 80's. But these are UNCUT.  I remember seeing them, some entire episodes have been pulled from television broadcast and have not been seen in a generation and you'll be pleased to see ones you may not have seen back in the 70's due to the racial tensions. I loved seeing Stymie and Farina play their roles brilliantly, I wish they would have stayed with the gang even after they got older. But Buckwheat certainly filled the void when they left the show.  God bless all the Gang. May they R.I.P.",1464048000,11,3938,4.556657223796034

2050310,5,B0001ZZ4PA,Love it,1425340800,,7,3.0
2050311,3,B0001ZZ4PA,"Well, I grew up watching these on TV in the 1970s here in S. California. I loved them and anytime Tom Hatten was on introducing these on Sundays, it was an added little treat. This set by Genius Entertainment tried to get us fans to buy into the fact that this package stated UNEDITED, RESTORED shorts of Hal Roach's 80 starting in 1929. So, with owning a few of the VHS by Cabin Fever put out several years ago, I wondered just how amazing it would be. It was a let down. The company completely lied to us consumers and fans alike. They were NOT RESTORED, NO UNEDITED and several of them were titled from BLACKHAWK Films that covered the original titles! I was NOT a happy rascal!!
 However, I did watch the entire box set, from disc 1 to disc 8 over a few days time.

I found the special features exceptional as well as the introductions by some of the last remaining ""OUR GANG"" comedy cast members.
A nice brochure with information on each disc and the chronological order of episodes were a plus. However, the brochure had some minor mistakes. The packaging of the box I have is not the same as this one pictured. The wording on the package in front was changed as it should be!
Here are the BLACKHAWK titled films ~
DISC 1 ~ BOXING GLOVES, MOAN AND GROAN, SHIVERING SHAKESPEARE
DISC 2 ~ A TOUGH WINTER
DISC 4 ~ KID FROM BORNEO
DISC 5 ~ ANNIVERSARY TROUBLE, LITTLE PAPA
DISC 6 ~ LITTLE SINNER, PINCH SINGER
DISC 7 ~ THREE SMART BOYS, ROAMIN' HOLIDAY, BEAR FACTS, CAME THE BRAWN, FEED 'EM AND WEEP, THE AWFUL TOOTH, HIDE AND SHRIEK.
DISC 5 had ""WASHEE IRONEE"" as an EDITED version. You could obviously tell when the little Chinese boy comes to help them with the clothes. and DISC 1 ""BEAR SHOOTERS"" looked like it had a scene or two edited also. Why? Don't know why. If this Genius company took the time to actually go back and restore these classics like they said they DID on the package, fans would be ecstatic about this box set!
I do give them credit for a wonderful layout of the package and the special features on it. These I love.
DISC 8 ~ BONUS FEATURES:
""OUR GANG"" cast member JEAN DARLING introduction.
3 SILENT SHORTS: Dog Heaven (no music or sound), Spook Spoofing (no music or sound), Barnum and Ringling, Inc. (appears new music was made for this around 1984?).
~ THE STORY OF HAL ROACH and OUR GANG feature.
~ RASCALS and RACIAL ISSUES feature.
~ CATCHING UP WITH THE RASCALS featuring surviving cast members: JEAN DARLING, DICKIE MOORE, ANNIE ROSS, JERRY TUCKER.
  They discuss who they were and how the series affected their lives and after. Wonderful to see them all!
~ MEMORIES OF SPANKY with Author Rick Sapphire.

DVD introductions are as follows ~ DISC 2 by Tom Hatten, DISC 3 by Dickie Moore, DISC 4 by Jerry Tucker, DISC 5 by Jerry Tucker, DISC 6 by Author Richard Lewis Ward, DISC 7 by Annie Ross, DISC 8 by Jean Darling.

Now, if you should want the shorts with the original titles in place in all 80, then I might suggest you either get the Cabin Fever VHS 21 volume set and transfer them over to DVD yourselves with a VCR/DVD recorder, or get the individual DVD Vivendi releases with PETE the Dog on front cover. There are 7 I believe in all.

Overall, 5 STARS for the package and the Special Features along with the Silent 3 shorts on DISC 8. 3 stars for the content. It's fair, but could have been much better.
My personal all time favorite episodes are  FLY MY KITE, CHOO-CHOO, DIVOT DIGGERS, THE LUCKY CORNER, KID FROM BORNEO.

UPDATE: Original OUR GANG cast member JEAN DARLING passed away on SEP. 4, 2015 at age 93 in Germany. She died of natural causes and was living with her son at the time. So, it makes DISC 8 Introduction that much more special because of her. THANK YOU JEAN FOR ALL YOU DID FOR THE SERIES! YOU WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED HERE. We'll MISS YOU!",1424995200,7,3804,4.384397163120568

2050359,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"I thoroughly enjoyed most of the shorts in this collection; some of them never appealed to me to begin with (notably the later entries) but the majority of them still tickle the hell out of me.  I recently read an interview with Hal Roach from some years ago where he maintained that to him, Alfalfa (who was a very popular character with audiences) was not a ""natural"" actor like the other kids and somehow, his studied approach somewhat tainted the performance of his costars eventually, as they too, learned how to ""act"" and the films lost that spontaneity and charm the earlier shorts elicited from his young performers.  You can actually almost see this slowly taking place as you watch the shorts in chronological order on this DVD set.

The silent shorts in this collection were interesting to me as we kids never saw this on TV while growing up and they are often very amusing in their own right, even without dialogue.

Speaking of watching Our Gang/The Little Rascals on television as youngsters, I truly DON'T understand the criticism leveled at the picture and sound quality problems here and there.  After all, most of this film is OVER 80 years old now--you can only work so much ""restoration"" magic with faulty prints and negatives.  The major plus of all this is that despite some visible ""wear and tear"", we seem to have forgotten how just plain crummy these things looked and sounded as we parked in front of the old black and white TV--with it's little transistor radio-like speaker--in our living rooms after school to watch the Rascals.  Remember those days--back when TVs had knobs and you had to get up to turn the channel? It's hard to remember now as we've become jaded with digital technology.  The images we saw on that old TV were prints that were dim, grainy, crackly, scratched, you name it! And that's how they would have looked being projected on a screen, let alone how they appeared to us on our old tube televisions. Let's be grateful for what we have here in this collection and how much better they both look and sound.

But back then, we never complained--what we saw was what we got, and it never detracted from our enjoyment of the kids and their antics. Highly recommended! And for the record, my all-time favorite rascal surely must be the somewhat neglected Farina; I could relate to him as a kid because he always came across as just plain lazy and shiftless, but possessed a true genius for devising schemes to get other kids to do his work.  I used to pull similar stunts on my younger brother, so in my book, Farina is the man!

This collection is highly and enthusiastically recommended!",1400976000,3,2635,4.669546436285097

Our Gang Comedies (5-discs) is the follow-up collection you cannot be without. I find there is little difference between the two wonderful series.

2050399,3,B0001ZZ4PA,"I was not going to buy this collection, based on the reviews that I saw here.  Then, one of Amazon's amazing sales came up: $26.49 for the whole collection.  It was an offer I couldn't refuse.  And now, having finally watched all the DVD's, I have no regrets -- though I don't know that I would feel that way had a paid much more for it.  The picture quality isn't bad, with some unfortunate exceptions (notable Anniversary Trouble).  As someone who prefers authenticity, I found the Blackhawk titles increasingly annoying; they become more frequent toward the end.  The commentaries are few and far between, and in some cases, the commentator doesn't have much to say, anyway.  On one of the DVD's, one of the original Rascals, Jerry Tucker, gives an enthusiastic endorsement of the series; later on the same DVD, a commentator belittles Tucker's contribution to the series -- a rather strange moment.

As to the series itself: all of the films are wonderful, but some are more so than others.  Personally, my least favorites are the Gordon Douglas directed shorts.  The production values of these later films are higher, but the films lack the heart of the earlier shorts, especially those directed by Robert McGowan.  Other than Porky and Buckwheat, the featured characters in the Douglas shorts -- especially Alfalfa, Darla and the older Spanky -- lack the charm of Jackie Cooper, Chubby, Dorothy DeBorba, Wheezer, Stymie and Baby Spanky.  Yet the graphic design both in these DVD's and on the packaging favors the later period.  As far as I am concerned, this betrays a certain ignorance of the series, as if the series reached its peak in the Douglas films.  This isn't much, I know; but it just added to my annoyance.

So -- a great series, with less than a great presentation.  It you can get this collection for $26.49 or less, go for it.  Otherwise, let the buyer beware.",1362787200,,1881,4.773993808049536

2050401,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"I feel some of the reviews here may be misplaced because I don't think they are in relation to the Complete Collection released by Genius.  A lot of them talk about how most of the episodes were silent shorts and few of them featured the more familiar ""Rascals"" such as Spanky or Alfalfa, leading to negative reviews about them not being what they expected. However, to those reviews that pan the Complete Collection featuring the 80 original Hal Roach shorts, I just want to add my say, which is, I'm happy with this set. Except for about the first two episodes on disc 1 where the sound seemed to fluctuate, being too loud in some places and not loud enough in others, I was not bothered by the sound or picture quality. For a show that aired in the '20's and '30's I believe the picture quality is as good as you're going to get, short of looking like something of modern DVD transfer quality. The film on mine wasn't stretched or chopped. As for the maybe not so ""uncut"" status, the two episodes mentioned, Washee Ironee and Bear Shooters, don't happen to be at the top of my list of favorite shorts anyway, so again I'm not particularly bothered if any footage was missing from those. When I watched The Little Rascals on TV as a kid about thirty years ago, of course a lot of material wasn't aired, being un-PC or flat out racist for the times.  So to see the parts or even entire shorts that I didn't see then was fascinating. Me personally, I just enjoy reliving all my favorite characters.  All the old gang is here, Stymie, Buckwheat, Darla and they're as fresh as ever. The classic shorts I remember from so long ago are here and funny as ever. I guess your enjoyment of this set will depend what exactly you're looking for. Perfect picture and sound or a trip back to your childhood in the old DeLorean. I was looking for a time travel experience and that's exactly what I got. And to quote Buckwheat, in my book that makes this set ""Otay!""",1361750400,3,1952,4.416666666666667

2050425,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"There's been some criticism circulating in reviews about the tampering of these original ""Our Gang"" classics. I can only say that it's the CONTENT that matters. Yes, some have been edited for TV syndication or have different opening (generic) titles. But this collection, in my opinion, is the ""real deal"". It certainly brings back fond memories of watching these shorts on a local station at my friends' house on a hot summer afternoon growing up. Certain ones stick out in my memory, such as ""Teacher's Pet"", ""Hi!-Neighbor"" and pretty much all the ones with Alfalfa.
When sound hit the movie industry, all the studios were scrambling to adapt to this new invention, and Hal Roach Studios were no different. Thus, the earliest sound efforts (Ex: ""Boxing Gloves"" really suffers as sound keeps going in & out, resulting in a boxing match that should have the loud raucous noise of the crowd but instead, has eerie silence. It makes the short more bizarre than funny) are usually clumsy outings, with scenes marred by noise or awkward dialogue. But it didn't take Roach & co. long to master the use of sound, and the next season put the series back in stride.
Of course, any fan of The Rascals will tell you the most ""famous"" of the kids is the line-up of Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat (who never said much, but could ""speak"" volumes with a camera look), Darla & Porky. My faves? The Jackie Cooper era produced some thoughtful, charming shorts; and when little Spanky came along, there was a long string of comedies which really showed the series at its peak. And anyone can tell you that when Alfalfa opened his mouth to sing (off-key), it was the start of one long laugh.
Some credit is also due to Stymie, the black child with the bowler hat, whose timing & delivery were terrific; Tommy Bond, who later became Butch the bully, did the role so well that he could almost act rings around everyone else; and the overall cuteness of Darla, Dickie Moore, Scotty Beckett, and yes, even Petie the Pup, that canine scene-stealer.
Unfortunately, the last handful of shorts made by Roach suffered in quality, probably due to the fact that they would be discontinued soon, (by Roach, but picked up by MGM anyway) and the attitude was, ""Let's just get the series over & done"". Too bad.
The DVD bonus features are simply dandy. This is a DVD collection to treasure for all fans of the series, and to be watched by ANY generation. For this was a simpler time for kids, when comedy invention & imagination flourished, driven by the talent of these amazing children. Thank you, Little Rascals, for all the joy & laughter---your kind will never come this way again.",1347408000,5,2647,4.706896551724138
2050426,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"... this remains one of the best attempts to date at preserving the Our Gang/Little Rascals legacy on DVD.

While far from ""complete"" -- to date, no DVD package has come close -- this set does cover comprehensively the series' best-known (i.e. most televised) period: the 80 talkies shot by Hal Roach Studios between May of 1929 and June of 1938.

And on the whole, though there do appear to be minor cuts and presentation mistakes here and there, the shorts are in fine shape and many are still riotously funny.

For me, this middle period between the silents and the increasingly moralistic MGM-produced shorts of the late '30s and early '40s was the high water mark of the series. These children were wonderfully unaffected, the world in which they are set is instantly believable, the adults who enlisted and directed the children had a persistent and intuitive sense of their potential and the adults sparingly cast around them (like Edgar Kennedy, who is in two brilliant entries on Disc 1) are often spot-on. The films should appeal effortlessly to anyone who grew up before our current high-tech age.

True, there are occasional dips. These were shot in a less enlightened era and while ""racist"" may be too strong a word -- the tone is typically sweet -- you'll run into stereotypes about African-Americans throughout. (Especially egregious ones appear in A Tough Winter, which is effectively destroyed by Lincoln Perry's ""Stepin Fetchit"" character, and Our Gang Follies of 1936.)

The kickoff episode Small Talk still suffers from the sound issues that led to its being withdrawn from the TV syndication package in the '80s and other early episodes suffer from oddly long silences that suggest degradation of the audio tracks. (Subtitling would have been nice, too.)

Here and there are too-practiced performances (like Leon Janney in Bear Shooters) that are a poor match to the Our Gang vibe. And of course the quality fluctuates somewhat. There's an unhappy tendency in the later going to throw plot to the wind and just put on a show.

But overall, this is still an amazing experience. Even after 170 episodes (counting the 93 silents that pre-dated this set), Roach never gave up -- only a few episodes are ""business as usual"" -- and the riveting ""Hide and Shriek"" (the second-to-last episode) sets a lovely tone at the end. The shorts would continue for six more years under the aegis of MGM, but they'd never be as consistently good again.",1346025600,3,2454,4.884615384615385
2050427,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"This is a great collection (at least so far).
I received this yesterday and watched 4 or 5 of the shorts last night and they were GREAT.
My brother and I always watched the Little Rascals before and after school when we were kids in the early 70s and it has been a LONG time since I have seen them.
We still ocassionally quote some of our favorite lines.
The shorts seem much better now as a middle aged adult than they did when I was a kid.
My favorite character has got to be Stymie, he's such a smooth talking little guy.
""Them ain't babies, them's fidgets"" just kills me.
I look forward to watching all of the shorts and sharing the Rascals with my 5 & 7 year old niece and nephew.
Some reviewers have complained that this is NOT remastered or the the frames are ""blown up"" and do not fit their tv screen.
I haven't seen this problem but I have noticed some grainy shots or one scene where it looked like the film broke and was taped together.
This prints are 80 years old now and maybe the originals were not stored in the best conditions.
All I know is I enjoyed them as a kid and I will enjoy them again as an adult.
And for less than $40 (including FREE shipping)for all 88 shorts, this seems like a bargan to bring back childhood memories.",1345507200,3,1248,4.182572614107884

I myself was happy to watch this set for bringing back memories of watching them as a kid. If you are someone like me who hasn't seen the little rascals episodes in years and don't care about the exactness of each frame then you are going to be very happy with this set. I find myself going back to watching the episodes and laughing constantly. I am very happy that I purchased this set and I think many will find the same feelings as me. The set even comes with not only a list of episodes but a fact sheet about each of the little rascals and shows when each actor/actress joined the group and left. Lastly it has information about what many have heard in the past as ""The Curse of the Little Rascals"" in which many have died soo early in life. Just great reading material. There are former little rascals that give some insight on what it was like and to be a part of the gang lol.

Most prints are from 35mm elements whish is great, but the image has been altered and ""blown up"" which cuts off areas of the frame. Some titles are from 16mm Blackhawk prints. I don't mind that so much, but a few like ""Little Pappa"" are from WORN Blackhawk prints. What a disgrace this Box set is. When the set first came out it was $89.95.

I wanted to go straight to the tenth show on one disc and found that you have to watch or fast-forward through the nine that come before it.  That seems like a waste of time in my opinion.

The quality of the product is very good.  I enjoyed watching the interviews on the last disc.

The Little Rascals represent what was once right with America.  These kids had no Internet or social media.  But....they had fun, they learned from their mistakes, they failed, they succeeded, they got along, then they didn't.  They were bullied (by Butch), but learned to understand and overcome it.  There were no seat belts, no restrictions, and no helmets.  They risked everything, and came out stronger, wiser, happier, and healthier because of it.  They solved their own problems, without adults.  The kids today are missing that, and it's wonderful to watch unfettered freedom at play.  A simpler time, an innocence, a look at childhood the way it was meant to be.  Yes, it was fantasy, but still close to the reality of those times.  They were ""the greatest generation.""

If you zoom to fill a wide screen it will cut off parts of the screen. On normal you'll have the black bars on each side but you won't lose any of the picture.

Together with the Laurel and Hardy shorts from the same studio and period, the Little Rascals films contain a magic all their own, and as a lifelong devotee I'm thoroughly delighted with this set. Compiled in chronological order on 8 discs, the films look great - better than any prior editions, and as good as we're likely to see on DVD.*

 For extras, we get introductions and commentaries by film historians Richard Bann and Richard Lewis Ward, 3 bonus silent shorts, a documentary, a discussion on the Rascals' racial interplay, and a piece on surviving members of the series.

Do yourself a big favor and buy this. Perhaps more than any other films, these priceless gems capture the innocence and charm of a bygone era that you'll want to revisit often. Afterall, who could ever get enough of these totally natural and lovable kids?

*Update, August 22, 2012.

As other reviewers are saying, the 7-disc set from Vivendi surpasses this edition in overall quality. Genius was bought out by Vivendi and the shorts underwent a thorough re-mastering, this time having been transferred from 35mm prints with their original opening titles. The menu set-up, intros, and chronological order of the films is the same as the Genius set. However, the Vivendi volumes don't include the special features nor the bonus silent shorts included in the Genius set. If you're a stickler for the best quality on these particular films (as I am), get the individual Vivendi discs. If you're not that picky and want a more compact package with the bonus material, the Genius edition is fine.",1320883200,2,1700,4.943859649122807

I gave this 4 out of five (the one fatal flaw, as others had mentioned earlier, racial stereotypes in some of the very early shorts), but generally very hillarious. Among my personal favorite Rascal/Gang shorts, 1932's ""Free Wheeling"" when Stymie drives fellow rascals around in a cart, mule breaks lose, cart ends up rollind down Southern California roadway...and of course that's when all hell breaks loose. Another one is ""Lucky Corner"" when they parade, try to sell lemon aid (a bully steals it), then Spanky & Alfalfa plant some electrical devise in the bully's pants & the bully jumps, winces & squirms all over the place. I also like ""Divot Diggers"" where the kids are caddies for some golfers from 1936-the cause havok on the golf course as well (note Darla fast picking dandilions or flowers as the kids are on some flat board as they slide down the hill) right around the same time 3 Stooges did a short ""Three Little Beers"" where Moe, Larry & Curly creat havok on a golf course as well. Darla Hood & Spanky Mcfarland were always my favorite rascals with Alfalfa Switzer, Buckwheat Thomas, Stymie Beard not too far behind. These are the Roach shorts. I own several of the early MGM shorts--the first dozen or two of the MGM shorts were not bad, but I simply refuse to watch the later ones where too many of the classy original rascals left, replaced by Janet or Frogy, pretty much the same way I feel that the Stooges were right on the mark 80% of the time,with Moe, Larry, Curly or Shemp-but I refuse to watch the Joe Besser ones.

2050477,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"Hello to all Little Rascals fans. I felt compelled to add in my two cents about this collection, after reading certain negative reviews on the set here. Alot of people seem to think the cabin fever VHS set of 21 videos is somehow superior to this set. That just simply is not true. The VHS set is indeed the best there is for the VHS format, but after careful evaluation of that set and this, [I have both], This DVD set is clearly the winner here. [THE CABIN FEVER DVD SET FROM 1999 IS THE BEST OF THEM ALL, BUT UNAVAILABLE TO BUY AT A REASONABLE PRICE IF YOU CAN FIND IT]. The reason some think the VHS set is of better picture quality is simply because the VHS format tends to be slightly blurry, and because of that, it actually hides film defects. DVD is so sharp that it will bring out old film defects. Re-mastering of films from the 1920s and 1930s is very different compared to Re-mastering a film from the 1980s or 1990s. If you compare the two sets side by side, running the same film you will notice that on this DVD set, the trees look totally in focus and crisp, but on the VHS, the trees are blurry and out of focus. Written words on signs in the background on the DVD version are clear and readable, but on the VHS version, you can barely make out the words. As far as sound goes, the DVD version is a little harsh, on the VHS its not as harsh. That's because the sound on the VHS is analog. Again, digital sound on old recordings is so clear that you also hear the defects better as well. [Most, but not all] of these prints are the same prints they used for the VHS and DVD Cabin Fever versions. Some of the beginning titles are different than the Cabin Fever versions. That's really not such a big deal, the story is really what matters. I don't expect perfection from any film from that long ago. In the old movie house days, these films were just leaders to the main attraction film. The one big plus about this new set is the fact that they are all in chronological order! No other previous set offered that. We are all lucky to still have them available this many years later. To all people who decided to not buy this because of bad reviews here, I urge you to reconsider. This truly is a very nice set. All of the films are excellent considering their age. Very watchable and very enjoyable. Even at the full 80.00 price, its only a dollar a movie. On a non HD TV they look stunning! Old films in alot of cases never look right on a large HD TV. I know there are many exceptions, But i read alot of reviews for old movies that were mastered to blu-ray, and alot look worse on blu-ray. The technology doesn't match the old movie look. I really don't know what else to say, I feel bad for the folks that decided not to buy this just because of a few slightly misguided reviews here. I'm sure they meant well, and may think they are trying to help us all out, but in my opinion those reviews are a little misguided, they don't seem to be looking at the big picture, they don't seem to be considering all things involved that pertain to getting the best out of such an old film and technology. And maybe the copyright holders made it difficult and overly expensive for GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT to put this set out in a perfect way that we all would have preferred? There are alot of greedy copyright holders out there. This is the best that your gonna get for these old classics. And waiting for a blu-ray version might indeed end up being a big let down.

The dog Pete,The rascals couldn't have ask for a better friend and pal.

As I said I had many favorite videos but if I have to chose,I guess the very favorite was the one where Spanky was in bed sick and shooting at flies with a cork gun.

I looked the Rascals up on Wikipedia and they had some interesting happenings after they each left the movies.

2050488,3,B0001ZZ4PA,"Starting with RAILROADIN' in 1929 and ending with 1938's HIDE AND SHRIEK, there were indeed exactly 80 Little Rascals sound shorts produced by Hal Roach Studios. Two silent films were released early in this run of 82, both during '29: SATURDAY'S LESSON and CAT, DOG & CO.

Roach sold the franchise to distributor MGM in mid 1938. Spanky continued under Metro until he was 14. UNEXPECTED RICHES (1942) was his Rascals finale.

During these last transition years, new kids like Tisket 'n Tasket, 'Froggy' Laughlin and Robert Blake (as Mickey) were added to the mix, but once Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer retired from the group after KIDDIE CURE (1940), all the old magic was gone. George 'Spanky' McFarland failed to make the grade as a teen and adult actor, while Switzer had a decent career in minor roles for another 18 years.

Rascals collections that offer 87 or 88 titles pad the count by including several silent-era Our Gang comedies, but as is not made clear in this item's product description, 80 is the correct number of HAL ROACH sound shorts.

The one I ultimately chose and recommend is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Rascals-Collectors-Edition-11-DVD-Boxed-Set-87-Episodes/dp/B0014B7NG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Rascals Collectors Edition-11 DVD Boxed Set-87 Episodes</a>.

I'm getting blamed because I tried to help, tried to fix what they were doing. I couldn't; I didn't even know what all they were doing until paying customers told me. Leonard Maltin and I were originally supposed to do the extras, but the alleged Geniuses at Genius Products hired others instead. The first two people who the ""others"" who WERE hired came to for help were Leonard and me. Leonard had a conflict. But we agreed that I should see what I could do to mitigate the damage we knew Genius would cause. But I got involved at the end, I was not in charge, and they would not listen to what I told them anyway. After all, they're Geniuses. Or thought they were. In fact, they did not know what they did not know. And did not care, either. It's sort of like this: The Dodgers are off to a rough start this year. Let's suppose I have the best curve ball and fast ball since Sandy Koufax. The team signs me, but not until the season is almost over. And in any case, they won't let me play.

2050509,3,B0001ZZ4PA,"These are supposed to be ""restored"" films. However the quality does not look restored at all, in the modern sense that the image and sound quality has been digitally processed. About half of the shorts have obvious film scratches, jumpy video (sprocket damage), and poor audio. Several are obvious transfers from 16mm. This is a lot of money to pay for marginal quality. I can only say, that having this complete set is better than no set. There is no comparison to the restorations of the Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto films, for example. The later films look and sound like new, which is what the modern technology is capable of. I was hoping this would be the case with the Little Rascals; but no such luck. Hopefully, at some point in the future, a real restoration collection will be available.",1244246400,9,795,4.6453900709219855
2050510,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"The sound quality on some of the earlier episodes is awful and there are weird periods where the sound is totally gone.  Edits are jumpy and sometimes the picture is a bit blurred.  If you're a collector or someone who can't get past awkward production values, this might not be the right set for you.

But if you're someone who wants to relive treasured entertainment moments from your childhood and share them with a jaded new generation, this is magic!

My 7-year-old and I have laughed ourselves to tears watching these shorts.  I get all excited seeing episodes I still remember and my daughter just loves seeing kids like her getting into all sorts of mischief.  She doesn't care that it's black and white, though she was puzzled at first, and the choppiness of the edits strikes her as a planned technique to make it even funnier.  And it's guaranteed that when the action is speeded up, we'll both howl.

How wonderful to know that these rather simple and innocent little tales can still resonate and delight a whole new generation of kids.  I'm buying them for all the families in my life with kids to give the gift of shared laughter.

My only real disappointment (I expected the quality might be questionable) was the prominence of the NRA logo on many of the episodes.  Don't remember that from my childhood and found it truly disturbing.

2050512,3,B0001ZZ4PA,"Yes, it's a shame that a lot of the main titles are missing; that the MGM Lion often roars silently (a strange effect); that there is (unnecessarily) a shot missing in ""Bear Shooters"" (just after the dog swims out of the picture) and a critical shot missing in ""Washee Ironee""...  But still, all the great Hal Roach sound Rascal movies are here, and presented in chronological order.  True, there is some cropping in the print of ""Lazy Days"", but I didn't notice it anywhere else.  I don't care if a print is actually from the original 35mm negative or if it's a BLACKHAWK 16mm film, or what the sources are so long as images are clean and clear, and most of these are wonderful pristine-looking pictures (a few are not).

I compared the previous Hallmark release of ""Teacher's Pet"" with the new RHI print, and the print in this Complete Edition is definitely better and has fewer, not more, white specks; so they did do some restoration or they did go back to a better negative or interpositive.  On the other hand, ""Anniversary Trouble"" is terrible--the beginning of the title music is missing as well as the original title, and the print is old, scratched-up, it looks like mud, and the end music cuts off.  ""Little Papa"" is also a bad Blackhawk print, and the finale of the Roach series, ""Hide and Shriek"", my favorite from the final Hal Roach period, has a dark cloudy image, the soundtrack has no high frequencies, and the sound is about 3 frames out of sync with the picture.  So it cannot be denied, the advertisement at the top of the box set ""remastered * Restored * Uncut"" is a lie, and as you can see from so many of the reviews, as a virtual consensus, people are sensitive about and hate being lied to, especially in advertising...

It is impossible to imagine why the people restoring these movies would do such a great job on some films, and then blow others.  It's equally incomprehensible that they would not restore the titles and the title music.  (The title music often starts a few measures into the piece, or parts are missing making the sound jump.  This would be so EASY to fix, I bet those of you with Final Cut have already done it.)

Many have complained about the sound; the sound usually seems quite bright, but I have to admit that it is sometimes difficult and even impossible for me to make out some of the dialogue.

So yes, this set will have to be re-released properly.  Some day.  But for now, my recommendation: We have this, and it's worth getting.  Get it while it lasts.  I just hope that sometime before I die not only can we get a true-restoration of these movies, but that they will restore and release ALL the Hal Roach films.  So who do we write to -- Genius?

2050528,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"This was a pretty good DVD. The actual footage of all 80 episodes was uncut and intact. The picture quality was as good as can be expected for a 1930's group of films. The negative thing was that 20 of these episodes had the Blackhawk Films title cards of the 1980's and not the original title cards from Hal Roach Studios/MGM. Several early episodes had innacurate music on openings. A couple 1929 episodes had the circa 1934-slow version of ""Those Are The Good Old Days"" plaing over the intro. The problem is that 2 early episodes were made prior to that song existing. It was obviously added when Blackhawk Films had home video VHS and 16 MM rights.

The reason Blackhawk could not use original title cards was because MGM owned the rights to those and the ""Our Gang"" name and did not allow the original title cards until ""Cabin fever"" fot the rights to home videos in 1994. They then acquired title cards and the rights to use the title ""Our Gang"" for the first time. The reason Blackhawk prints were used for 20 episodes is unknown to me. Also several MGM prints were missing the MGM Lion roar and jump straight into the title cards.

Other than that, this DVD was enjoyable. Legacy could have done a better job with getting opriginal materials. At least the body of each episode continued to be complete.",1232496000,3,1310,4.546610169491525

2050533,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"I heard about this DVD on the radio. I was taken back to my childhood immediately. The imaginative ways these characters play is almost lost in our own children of today. Technology has taken the tools from them and placed them in front of screens.
 Because I'm lucky enough to work at a private progressive school, I still experience the vision of kids putting on shows, singing, and playing in mud.
I think every child should see this sweet and artistic way of interaction among kids from an era long gone...to spark a natural instinct towards vast expression. My only wish is for parents to explain the negative, narrow, and often racial undercurrents in these old films so that children realize the needed progress of acceptance and tolerance in today's world.",1231632000,,764,4.8320610687022905
2050534,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"In my opinion, the Little Rascals Complete box from Genius is `good, not great'.  I have no problem with the shorts themselves:  Each disc (the 7 shorts discs and the 8th `bonus' disc) runs around 3 hours or so, give or take, and whether or not you're familiar with the material, odds are you'll really like the shorts.  For me personally, it was great to finally see a lot of these again, which I hadn't seen in decades (since I last saw them on TV) and there are a fair amount that I'd NEVER seen before, due to syndication issues.  Except for some edits that others have noted, I assure you that many of these will DEFINITELY appear `new' to most viewers, as they're here `warts and all'.  I'm referring to segments that were edited out of TV versions, as they contained potentially sensitive racially-oriented material (such as the Stephin Fechit epi that I had never seen before, and certain elements of various plots that hinged on scenes containing politically incorrect gags).  Several of the stories now make sense, in their unedited form, now that the original material has been restored.  So from a purely creative and content perspective, these shorts get a 5-star rating overall: This part of the overall Gang/Rascals series (which had over 220 episodes in total, including the silents and the later subpar MGM shorts) had its peaks and valleys, but at various/numerous points (such as the Jackie Cooper epis, and in the middle of the Alfalfa/Darla/Spanky run), it really fired on all cylinders and there are back-to-back-to-back hands-down classics.  From a historical perspective, these films are awesome, esp. if you're like me and live in LA, and you can see that a lot of LA was still undeveloped in the 20's and 30's (locations included Culver City, Santa Monica, and the Roach Ranch outside of LA).  My late grandmother used to watch these with me, and said `that's what it really was like back then' (as far as life in the 20's and 30's), and seeing vintage cars, toys, appliances, etc. in mint condition is an excellent experience.  Any idea what Miss Crabtree's mint car is worth these days?!?!?!  Running Boards!!!  Castor oil!!!  Operator-assisted-calls!!!!  Added bonus:  a ton of the stunts, treatment of animals, gags (such as kids drinking gasoline/turpentine/etc.) would be absolutely prohibited by statutes/etc. these days - see `em in all their glory!

As for the presentation, there are some good and bad issues.  I'm not sure if these are truly `remastered' - sources seem inconsistent - some are Blackhawk films prints, some are the ones I recall seeing from TV.  Overall, quality is not bad considering some of these are between 70 to 80 years old.  Sporadic episodes have sound problems - where I had to jack the volume up and still couldn't hear the dialogue, and there are no subtitles (at least none I could activate)  Some grain on some of the prints (normal); others look great.  The booklet is somewhat skimpy and contains more than a few errors (as does the documentary where ""Sunshine Sammy"" is referenced but the footage is of a very young Farina).  DVD Extras are `good' if not hugely plentiful, and the somewhat longer interviews (5-10 min each with various participants) on disc 8 are insightful if brief.  The Roach documentary is about  hour long, and the min-docs are around 6-10 min each.  A couple of silents are bonuses on disc 8.  Handy tip: There are other video sets (I think one was from GoodTimes, years ago) that have some other archival footage - they'd make a good supplement to this set.  I'd also recommend searching out and/or keeping your Cabin Fever, GoodTimes and similar DVD's - some of the silents were on those, and to date I think those are the only places to get some of these.  Maybe someone will get on the ball and release a non-bootleg set of the silents?

Overall, a pretty good set, if not a total home run.  I definitely had many enjoyable nights watching the discs (it'll take quite a while to get thru them all) so I'm happy with my purchase.

Also - make sure you own a copy of the excellent Leonard Maltin/Richard Bann book - it's a nice 'go-to' for additional perspective once you watch these.  Get the updated (yellow-cover) version (as opposed to the red one).",1231632000,8,4248,4.7609289617486334

Two rascals are misidentified.  ""Mickey"" is actually Donald and ""Scotty Becket"" is Dickie Moore.  Evidently, the publishers never watched an episode or they would know.

In my opinion, they could have done a lot better with it, but it's worth the $55 price from Amazon.  It's true that some of the shorts appear to be directly from the Blackhawk prints.  I'm not tremendously discerning when it comes to quality of the print, so I think these episodes are acceptable in this regard, but I am disappointed not to have the original opening/closing credits.  And, despite the ""uncut"" claim on the box, I do detect edits in a few spots.  I don't think this detracts overall, but it's still something of a let-down.  In a couple of episodes, I also noted that the sound was a little garbled - particularly in parts of one of my favorites, ""Teacher's Pet"" with Jackie Cooper.  I never noted problems like this in the old Cabin Fever VHS format.  I am also disappointed that the discs are not individually formatted so that you can select a specific episode to view from the menu - you have little else but the ""play all"" choice on each of the discs.  It's possible to navigate (""skip"") fairly efficiently through the segments of each short, but this is something of a hassle - something the dvd format should be able to offer over VHS!

I love the Little Rascals / Our Gang shorts and I do have the Cabin Fever on VHS (both sets). I do not see any difference at all. I do have a VHS player but I rarely use it so I wanted to upgrade Our Gang to DVD.  I am glad I ignored all the naysayers and bought this.

This set is fine - the picture quality is great; overall the sound is fine (hey, it was the 1920-30's - what do people want - dolby digital? thx??). The sound on the Cabin Fever release was the same!  I do not know anything about the Blackhawk brew-ha-ha. These episodes start with the Blackhawk logo, which is jumpy and grainy. But when the shorts start the picture is 100% fine. I guess if you are a perfectionist this may matter; it does not matter to me. And there are only a handfiul of these anyway (14 out of 80).

2050545,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"Watching these shorts on TV during the late 50's / early 60's is one of my many fun memories. The Twin Cities host of these classics was named Axel, and our old Zenith TV was tuned into Axel and His Dog every evening after school.

Axel is long gone now, along with Bonomo's Turkish Taffy, and penny baseball cards. Picking up this DVD has helped me extend my childhood into my sixth decade, as I now I share these great flicks with my granddaughter.

I have read some of the comments about the less than perfect quality of some of these shorts. I don't remember them being ""all that good"" back on our old black and white Zenith. They seem fine to me.

I save old records. LP's and 78's. There's sometimes ""pops"" and ""snaps"" in some of those old discs, but as long as the record doesn't ""skip"" I enjoy them. The Little Rascals / The Complete Collection doesn't ""skip"". I'm enjoying all of the shorts regardless of the film condition.

I missed the Cabin Fever DVD release, but did get the complete 22-tape VHS collection from Tower Records.  In the taped version, the same sections were missing.
I can only surmise that perhaps the person doing the restoration might have been Asian and took exception to those particular segments.
My real complaint, however, is the chintzy presentation and packaging.  No index of individual shorts; you have to fast forward.  I've seen better packaging, and only a very thin booklet of 12 pages is included.  They could have done a far nicer job and few, if anyone, would have balked at paying a few dollars more.

I think these go up to the 'Our Gang' series(when Spanky and them are older and Froggy is introduced and Robert Blake is in the series). Maybe that is another set coming. No one really mentions it here. I'll give it 4 stars so it won't 'kill' the ratings(trying to stay neutral). I'll give a 2 for the reviewers. UPDATE: I did buy it and I love it.

2050554,4,B0001ZZ4PA,"The set is much better than many are making it out to be. The majority of the shorts on this set open up with the RHI logo--those are the same prints used for the Cabin Fever releases. I was disappointed that some of these open with Blackhawk titles, rather than the original titles. I can't fault the image quality on the ""Blackhawk"" shorts viewed to date though. With one possible exception, they're sourced from 35mm elements, and they look and sound as good as I'll ever expect them to look and sound.

I've compared ""Hide and Shriek"" on this release (opens with Blackhawk titles) to the same short on a Cabin Fever DVD compilation. Visually, the two versions look virtually identical, with the only discernible difference being the original title cards in the Cabin Fever DVD.

The Cabin Fever releases from over a decade ago were less than pristine as well, especially the two reelers from 1929 and into the early 30s. Given the age of the shorts, and the checkered history of ""Our Gang,"" it's a miracle that most of these look as good as they do today.

I was disappointed when one of my favorite one-reelers from the late 30s, ""Feed 'em and Weep,"" opened with Blackhawk title cards. Once the short began, all was quickly forgiven. Between the gorgeous image quality, Johnny Arthur's performance as Darla's father, and the impeccable timing of the kids, all was right with the world for the next 10 minutes or so.

I'm very grateful that I didn't read the reviews of this set before opening it, as I too might have returned it unopened. It would have truly been my loss.

***Footnote*** Since getting this set, it has appeared to my own eyes, when looking at some of the shorts with Blackhawk titles, as if many or most of the title cards were taken from 16mm source material, followed by 35mm for the shorts themselves. I'm now convinced, for reasons that I don't understand, that this is the case.

As an example, for those who have this set, try watching ""The Awful Tooth,"" on disc #7. The title opens in a less than promising fashion, with a fairly bad looking Blackhawk title card. It's very scratchy, there's noticeable vertical jumping, and the brightness/contrast of the lettering varies constantly. The Blackhawk opening, as it runs, slips slightly to the left, leaving a narrow white strip on the right side of the screen. To discern this, viewing on a computer monitor would be very helpful, as any overscan will obliterate this. Once the titles conclude, that white strip on the right disappears and a beautiful and stable 35mm transfer of this short begins.

Why did this happen? I have no idea. Bizarre legal issues that forced the removal of the title cards for some of these shorts, perhaps? Issues that did not arise when Cabin Fever brought out their own releases in the 90s? I wish I knew the answer.",1226793600,14,2826,4.674044265593562

Somebody at Genius certainly wasn't.  Somebody over there screwed-up big time.  They'd have had a hit on their hands had they done the set correctly.,1226534400,42,299,4.88
2050558,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"For many people the only way they know Our Gang is from countless Little Rascal shows on television. So many will see new things here. From episodes never aired on tv to full 20 minute versions of the older ones. Some reviewers commented on missing pieces from a few of the shorts. I didn't notice them, but after reading the reviews I recalled seeing those missing pieces. The set is refered to as :The Complete Collection, well almost. I'm not going to count the silent shorts we don't get, but there is a fair chunk of the talkies missing that isn't mentioned in the product description. These are the Hal Roach talkies only. The MGM shorts are not included. Either way this is still a good collection. There are a few inaccuracies in the booklet. For example there is a section about the curse of the Rascals. In it they mention the death of Scotty (Scotty Beckett) but have Dickie Moore pictured, Dickie is very much alive and gave interviews for the set. They also mention the death of Mickey (Mickey Daniels) who was one of the original silent kids, but the picture is of a member of the Gang whose name escapes me at the moment (...and third in the American League.) Even with these errors and the lack of the other shorts it is still a good set.",1226534400,3,1254,4.456521739130435
2050559,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"I have been disturbed regarding the negative reviews of this DVD set. I admit that if you are a purist for the highest quality, you may be upset with the release. However, if you expect above average video quality and don't care if the titles to the films are the originals, this set is one of the most superior out there.  When I was a kid, I was thrilled to watch some of these films on 8 MM or Super 8 format. I did not mind the quality then or even the lack of sound. The so called ""worst"" quality on this DVD is based on 16 MM film transfers with sound. The quality on DVD is quite good even for these. However, the quality on 90% of the shorts is even better than this and is based on 35 MM transfers.

Now for the good to great aspects of this DVD set. First, there are new excellent documentaries about the rascals that are wonderful in quality.
There is even one which discuss the racism or lack there of in the series. Best of all, you get to see new interviews with the surviving cast members plus a very enjoyable retrospective on Spanky. The set includes 3 silent shorts and two of these shorts include optional commentary tracks recorded for this DVD release. Wonderful indeed!

There is often a comparision to the Cabin Fever releases of 10 years ago. Back then, they released 12 different videos each having 4 shorts. This is a total of 48 talking shorts from the Roach era. Each of these VHS tapes cost about $15 each for a total of $180 for the 49 shorts.

The new DVD collection has 8 long playing discs and covers all 80 of the talking Roach pictures. You get 32 additional shorts, and the cost of all 80 shorts is about $50. What a deal no matter how you look at it.

Yes, a few, and I mean a very few (2 or 3), may have some material cut out but the normal not fanatics would probably not even notice or care. We get the entire set including the wonderful shorts from 1930-1931 that have not been released in the Cabin Fever videos.

I guarantee that you will not be dissappointed with the set, and that you will have enourmous hours of fun viewing pleasure. The total playing time of the 8 discs is 23 hours!",1226188800,20,2131,4.223587223587224
2050560,1,B0001ZZ4PA,"It's really too bad that a DVD package this anticipated has so many flaws on display. For one, there are several instances where the audio sync to the picture is off a little, and in some cases off a lot (TOUGH WINTER). In this day and age there is really no excuse for this easily correctable problem.

Visually, what were supposed to be nice new masters are also often quite disappointing. There is frequently heavy artifacting and posterization due to over-compressed looking masters. For several shorts the producers of this set chose to utilize inferior 16mm Blackhawk Films prints rather than go back 35mm prints and negatives, and in these cases the original titles are also missing.

I happen to know better material exists on these films, and was utilized for the long out-of-print Cabin Fever VHS and DVDs ten years ago.  If you have the Cabin Fever disks, in spite of the age of their transfers you're probably gonna want to hang on to them, as some of these are a step down.

Unfortunately, this is the most complete collection of OUR GANG stuff out there, and you may end up wanting it just to see these films again, but be warned if your a stickler for quality, it is a very mixed bag, and sadly a missed opportunity.

11/11/08 - FURTHER viewing since I wrote this review has only yielded further dissappointment. Sadly I must note that there are almost constant issues of texture and detail getting swallowed up in pools of digital mush. I don't know if this is due to over-compression, or some overzealous filtering to remove grain and abrasion. Whatever the case, the result is frequent blurring and flattening of detail, textures, even facial features.",1225929600,50,1670,4.744827586206896
2050561,3,B0001ZZ4PA,"The idea was awesome: collect all the Roach talkies in one box set, fully re-mastered and uncut. The execution, however is questionable: about a quarter of the shorts are mastered from Blackhawk 16mm prints of dubious quality. Heck, I reckon that one of the final shorts, HIDE AND SHRIEK, was mastered off a VHS! The enclosed booklet is full of factual errors that a casual fan could spot, including sloppy typos (HEARTS ARE THUMPS is titled HEARTS ARE THUMP). I know, I know. Quibbles, right? Not really, when you consider that widely available bootleg DVDs look and sound just as good and even give you the original MGM opening titles for a fraction of the price. I think the real shame is the participation of Rascals expert Richard Bann. I'd love to hear his take on this half-baked set. Our Gang fans deserve better than this. I can't believe that Genius would think that these DVDs, of an admittedly somewhat limited appeal, would squeak by the BS detectors of seasoned fans who've been waiting for these classic comedies to receive the same treatment on DVD as the Three Stooges shorts. I love the comedy but I'd advise the curious to wait until more discerning fans dump these in the Used bin before purchasing. Nuff said.",1225584000,29,1230,4.725581395348837

At least 16 or 17 of the shorts are inferior Blackhawk prints. Two of the silents have no musical score and the third silent is a Blackhawk print. ""Washee Ironee"" and ""Bear Shooters"" have material missing. This DVD set is by no means ""remastered, restored and uncut"". I sent two emails to Genius Products and have not received any reply. With just a little more effort and a knowledgeable ""Our Gang"" consultant this could have been one of Genius Products' finest and best-selling DVD sets. Shame on them. I am returning this falsely advertised and poorly made product. Cabin Fever did a much better job for RHI in the 1990's.

One error in the booklet. On the 'curse of the Rascals"" page, that's not Mickey Daniels who's pictured. I think the pictured kid's name is Donald. He was part of the Miss Crabtree era, but was not Mickey Daniels. I guess they saw freckles and assumed it was Mickey.

Fever Rascals collection with Leonard Maltin's brief but informative
introductions. I don't think I'll be giving those away just yet; not after
seeing this half-hearted effort. Yes, the collection includes all the
Hal Roach shorts, as well as three (only three?) silent shorts. But don't
fall for the ""fully restored"" claim. Some of the films look as tired and
worn as old Blackhawk Film versions of the shorts (oh, wait! That's
because some actually ARE the Blackhawk versions!) The DVD ""bonus features"" are shockingly skimpy: short interviews with a few of the surviving Rascals which are about as in-depth as the fluff pieces on ""Entertainment Tonight."" I've seen better bonus features on public
domain Rascals tapes that I bought for under $5.00 in discount stores
years ago. Each DVD boasts a special intro by one of the former Rascals
or a ""film historian,"" each intro consists basically of the Rascal or
historian announcing something along the lines of, ""Here's some more
Rascals shorts; they're really great, hope you enjoy them!""
  The bonus booklet included in the collection is mainly a list of all
the shorts by title and pretty much nothing else; one exception is a
single page on the subject of ""The Curse of the Rascals,"" a very short
list of a few former Rascals who died young; a few of the photos on the
page are misidentified (a mention of Scotty Beckett and his tragic death
is accompanied by a photo of Dickie Moore, who is not only very much
alive but is one of the Rascals who appears on the DVD set as one of the
hosts!) Apparently, the folks at ""Genius,"" the company that put this
collection out, don't live up to their name.

When I opened this DVD set, I learned that the set was not really complete.  The restoration in some shorts looks worse than the non-restored Cabin Fever VHS tapes.

If you are a collector, you need to continue your efforts and get them all - I feel that it is worth the time to view everything that this series has to offer.",1225238400,18,567,4.352380952380952

On the plus side it's not horrible......if that's any consolation! The Little Rascals are one of the most important short film subjects in the history of film and they deserve better than this!

When I watched the first disc I thought ""this isn't that bad"" and I was hoping that the shorts would look better as they went along. This is not the case as some of the newer ones look grainy because of the source print being taken from Blackhawk prints, which are missing the original title cards! I could live with the missing title cards if the other prints weren't available or these prints looked better!....they do not!

Don't throw away you Cabin Fever VHS tapes, because overall I prefer them to this. There are some minor cropping issue also and I think I counted 16 or 17 Blackhawk shorts including one silent in this so-so collection. There are two edits to add to the list of disappointments. Washee Ironee and Bear Shooters have edits!

The extras are cool, but there is even better stuff available! Oh why do they do this? If you compare the new Three Stooges DVD sets to these, they pale in comparison. Maybe someday on Blue Ray they'll do it right, but for now this is as good as it gets, unless you want to search for the best individual prints. Life is too short for this option in my opinion! The material is 5 stars the half a** job on these shorts bring it down two stars for a 3 star rating!",1225238400,40,1551,4.359861591695502

Two additional Blackhawk prints, at least on my set, are ""Anniversary Trouble,"" and ""Little Papa.""
Because of shelf storage challenges, I'm keeping this boxed set along with a number of dvds containing good prints of many of the titles replaced here by the Blackhawk prints. I've given away my bulky vhs copies as terrific as the prints were. Unlike the restored Three Stooges releases, the Hal Roach product seems to take a beating here in the states. Europe has greater respect. I saw some shorts in the UK release of the complete Laurel and Hardy. Germany and, I believe, the Netherlands have also done right by them.

There is hissing and crackling on some sound tracks and it is difficult to understand what the kids are saying sometimes.

2050570,1,B0001ZZ4PA,"The Complete Collection of The Little Rascals DVD Set is being distributed by Genius Entertainment with the statements REMASTERED, RESTORED and UNCUT printed on the top and front of this set. It is NOT Remastered. It is NOT Restored. It is NOT Uncut. I cannot believe Genius Entertainment is allowed to falsely advertise this set and charge such a premium price for a dvd set that is in worse shape than my old television copies that I bought over the years.

I must make it clear that I would give 5 stars to The Little Rascals shorts for the shows themselves, but this set is such a huge disappointment, that I have to give it one star, since I cannot give it minus 10 stars, which is what it deserves!

Since I have these Little Rascal shorts on other dvd's, which I am certain people taped from their tv's over the years, I have something to compare them to. As I watched some of the episodes from my old copies and this new set, side by side, the most noticeable thing is the size of the film. This dvd set is blown up enough to cut off a border around the edges, leaving heads and feet cut off! I hate when things are ""remastered"" like this, cutting off parts of their heads or feet! They did this with Route 66, until the complaints were so numerous about it, that the company remastered Route 66 in it's proper size, where everyone had all their body parts.

The next thing that was very noticeable, were very wide white lines and specs throughout many of the shorts, that make it far too irritating to watch. The only obvious thing that they did was make the contrast stronger, the whites are whiter and the blacks are blacker. As I viewed this strong contrast closer, I noticed that they have eliminated details on the film, gray buttons on black pants are now invisible, as everything is TOO BLACK! The films are totally ruined!

It is obvious that Genius Entertainment simply blew the film up cutting off a border around the film, which also cut off heads on the top and feet on the bottom and sharpened the contrast, making every detail disappear into pure black or pure white! They actually have the audacity to call this remastered, restored and uncut! In reality it is BLOWN UP, OVERLY CONTRASTED, and UNVIEWABLE!

There is a bonus disc that I did enjoy parts of that features: 3 silent shorts in horrendous condition, The Story of Hal Roach and Our Gang, Racism and The Our Gang Comedies, and Catching up with The Little Rascals. The last features 2008 interviews with Dick Moore, Jean Darling, Jerry Tucker, Annie Ross and Rick Sapphire (Spanky's manager).

This dvd set is a thousand times worse than my old copies taken off the televison stations many years ago! How Genius Entertainment could make worse copies than old tv copies, I'll never know! I hope a reputable company will really make a restored, remastered and uncut copy of these treasured Little Rascal shorts, but until then, I'll have to be content with my old television copies, which are a thousand times more viewable than these horrendous, unviewable discs!",1225152000,665,3044,4.596685082872928

First was the Hal Roach silent classics that are commonly found and sadly, bootlegged all over the place, even on Amazon. Then there are the Hal Roach sound shorts which is what this box is. Third is the MGM sound shorts. The MGM shorts are not very good and not very funny. In fact, one of them was a financial flop.

While the silents are cute, this box set contains the best of the Our Gang/Little Rascals when they were in their prime. Better yet they are in chronological order so you can watch the Jackie Cooper ones in sequence, when Alfalfa enters the picture, Farina to Buckwheat, and more. ""Mike Fright"" is one of my favorites, but ""Fly My Kite"" is a classic you do not want to avoid.

Also, if these are indeed DVD 5 discs, the bitrate is going to be set so low to fit all of those shorts on a one layer disc the quality is going to be awful.",1217894400,5,642,4.582608695652174
2050581,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"This collection spans the golden years of Our Gang - after sound came in and before creative control went to MGM in 1938. As for the ones made after MGM took control - let's just say that MGM, having no real talent for slapstick comedy, did the same thing for the Little Rascals that they did for Buster Keaton's career. The following is the spotty history of the Hal Roach film library, and might explain why we are just now getting a good collection of these shorts. It comes from a posting over at Laughsmith.

Hallmark owned RHI and the sound Hal Roach film library for several years.  A corporate reorganization in 2007 made RHI and Hallmark ""sister"" companies (which are part of a holding company), and each has its own, separate management team.  RHI received the Roach film library in the reorganization.

The 80 1929 - 1938 Roach ""Our Gang"" films already received complete restorations (from negatives in the Library of Congress) in the early 1990s.  Cabin Fever Entertainment marketed the shorts in 1994, on 21 VHS volumes and 4 laser disc box sets.  Cabin Fever went bankrupt, RHI bought it, and then Hallmark bought RHI.  Now, Hallmark and RHI are separate entities.

RHI is packaging this boxset from those restorations.  Outside of packaging, distribution and marketing in partnership with Genius Entertainment, RHI is not yet doing any work in regard to upgrading their Hal Roach archives.

All of the Hal Roach titles owned by RHI have the original nitrate camera negatives, and have been safely housed by UCLA for several years (after Hallmark decided to discard the volatile negatives).  Hopefully, RHI will someday access these materials in an all-out restoration project of the rest of the Roach library.

As for the history of these shorts, in spring 1929, the Roach studios converted for sound recording, and Our Gang made its ""all-talking"" debut in April 1929 with the three-reel ""Small Talk"". Note that this is before many of the larger studios went to sound, and yet the children are much more natural in their performances than their adult counterparts. That's because the theory behind Our Gang from the start was for the children to behave as naturally as possible. At this point, only the camera is nailed down, not the children's acting. Jackie Cooper was featured in three 1930/31 shorts, but he soon went to Paramount to pursue a film career.

George ""Spanky"" McFarland joined the gang in 1931 at the age of three and remained with Our Gang until 1942. Initially all Spanky is able to do is say ""Remarkabawl"" (Remarkable) in response to the situation presented. After all, he is only three. The Buckwheat character started out as a female - sister of Stymie, but morphed into a male in 1935 after Stymie left the series. Darla Hood and Eugene ""Porky"" Lee also joined the gang in 1935.

Most people are most familiar with the Our Gang cast as it existed after 1936: Spanky, Alfalfa, Darla, Buckwheat, and Porky, and the bullies Butch and Woim and bookworm Waldo. So the shorts from 1936 -1938 in this set will involve the dynamics that you most associate with Our Gang. The entire series went on from 1922 until 1944. Also, even though these are comedies, be prepared for viewing a harsh world from the viewpoint of the depths of the Great Depression. For example, in 1931's ""Fly My Kite"" the kids' good friend ""Grandma"" is about to have everything she owns legally stolen by her stepson. She is worried about having to go to the county poor farm if that happens. In 1931, before Social Security, the county poor farm was a real place and not somewhere you would want to be.

I'm looking forward to seeing these shorts, which I can't remember seeing on TV since AMC went down the drain as a true classic TV channel about six years ago.",1217721600,90,3766,4.745788667687596

I made the mistake of purchasing Universal's initial release of Alfred Hitchcock presents (1955-1956) three to four years ago. These were two sided discs and also dual layered. The discs would lock up, skip and jump past segments and sometimes even shut down. I tried them on five different players and got the same results. Even upon making an exchange I got the same results.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Rascals-Vol-1-12-Cabin-Fever-Box-Set-6-discs/dp/B000065GE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Rascals: Vol 1 - 12 Cabin Fever Box Set (6 discs)</a>

The edited titles in this set are BEAR SHOOTERS & WASHEE IRONEE, they were complete in the Cabin Fever DVDs.

The old RHI VHS master got used for WASHEE IRONEE, about 11 minutes into the short, when the gang askes a Chinese boy how to wash clothes, you see him drink some water but the close up of him spitting the water on the clothes  & saying ""Washee, Washee"" is MISSING. The shot right after with the gang looking puzzled is also MISSING. We pick up again with a longer shot of the gang spitting the water on the clothes.  The reason for this edit is really a mystery. It does not censor anything that we don't see elsewhere in the short, it must have been an editing error when putting reel 1 & reel 2 together.

Blackhawk never put their name on any 35mm material that they used.  They spliced their titles in to their 16mm negative.  The sad part is that we will be deprived of the original title artwork.

Here is the list of the 14 titles with the Blackhawk homemovie title cards:

Barnum & Ringling Inc., which does NOT have the original Hal Roach Music & Effects soundtrack!  This was one of the first Hal Roach silent films to be produced with a Music & effects soundtrack disc for theaters to run with the film.  The Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum often runs this short with its original soundtrack.  Too bad we get the Blackhawk Gaylord Carter soundtrack here!
Boxing Gloves
Moan & Groan Inc.
Shivering Shakespear
A Tough Winter
The Kid From Borneo
The Pinch Singer
Three Smart Boys
Roamin' Holiday
Bear Facts
Came The Brawn
Feed'em & Weep
The Awful Tooth
Hide & Shriek

--------Original review-------

Not only will we get all of the Hal Roach sound shorts in one package, but a nice surprise will be the inclusion of some silent shorts.  A few of these are making their DVD debut!

I am assured by Genius Entertainment that these will be dual layered DVD-9 discs, well capable of handling the amount of content on each disc.

The only minor disappointment is that MGM released 22 of the silent Hal Roach Our Gang (Little Rascals) Comedies and 17 of them exist.  RHI owns the rights to these which keeps them off of the public domain Our Gang sets.  It would have been nice to see all 17 of these in this set, but 3 is better than none.",1217376000,382,8772,5.173144876325089
2050584,5,B0001ZZ4PA,"WOW!  *ALL* the Hal Roach era talkies in one reasonably priced package!  While they are not *truly* remastered the overall video quality is excellent!  The downside are the ones from ""Blackhawk"" that are 16mm ""masters"".  The video on these is not as good as the ones from RHI.  While this is a bit of a disappointment it's not a ""deal breaker"" in my eyes.  I've not seen the ""Cabin Fever"" DVD sets but these are much better overall than my old ""Cabin Fever"" VHS copies.  There *is* video degradation on many of the earlier shorts and the audio levels are not great but this is really to be expected with films of this age and era considering that these have not had the wholesale preservation typically done for ""serious"" type films.  Even then, it's not bad enough to make the shorts affected unwatchable.  In fact these are far better than I remember them being back when I watched them on TV as a kid.  My largest disappointment is that there is no closed captioning or subtitles.  This would be helpful for some of the earlier shorts where some of the audio is ""in the mud"".  It's also sad that a couple of the shorts have been edited for, what appears to have be, PC reasons.  Again, disappointing, but *not* a deal breaker.

Others have mentioned the lack of original music and other issues with the bonus silent shorts.  I don't have this problem because they are *bonus* features and being silent films are really more of a curiosity to *most* viewers, something they'll watch once if at all.  While this is a major disappointment for film historians the majority of buyers of this product have probably never seen, nor even knew, there were silent ""Our Gang"" films.

These are the Roach-produced shorts with sound that were syndicated for television under the title ""The Little Rascals"", as MGM retained the rights to the ""Our Gang"" trademark.

As MGM retained the rights to the feature ""General Spanky"" when Roach purchased back the rights this is not included.

It's easy to say get this because we may never see a proper restoration of these classic shorts, but that's not a truly valid reason to make the purchase.  Get this because they are *true* classics every child (young or old) should have in their collection.

Highly recommended.",1216944000,21,4964,4.171907756813417
2050585,1,B0001ZZ4PA,"All movies are from the 20's and the 30's, silent movies isn't my thing. I honestly had no idea this collection was containing these old movies. One episode last up to 20 minutes, too much for me.",1199923200,8,196,4.324324324324325
2050586,2,B0001ZZ4PA,I bought these for my husband who loves watching the Little Rascals. He was disappointed with this set as there were not many episodes and many were very old and not the more familiar ones seen on t.v. I don't feel it was worth the cost.,1198886400,3,237,4.173913043478261
2050587,1,B0001ZZ4PA,"I was very disappointed in this collection of Little Rascals shorts.  We have a few other Little Rascal DVDs, but I remember so many other shorts from when I was a kid.  My son LOVES the old B&W Rascals.  I ordered this collection because it looked like it was going to have different stuff than the other collections out there.  And the description makes it seem like it's heavy on the ones with Spanky, Alfalfa and Darla (they are my son's favorites) in them.  But instead almost 3 of the 5 DVDs have the really old rascals that are from the silent movie time.  The few shorts that do have talking in them are the same 3-4 shorts that are in ALL the collections.  DVD #5 is a reunion of the Rascals 25 years later.  I know everyone looks for different things, but for me this collection was a waste of money.",1198627200,14,810,4.282894736842105
2050588,3,B0001ZZ4PA,"This is a great collection for those of us who are TRUE Our Gang fans.  Those who only know Darla, Spanky, Alfalfa and that cast don't know about Sammy Morrison, Mickey Daniels, Mary Kornmann, Alan ""Farina"" Hoskins and Joe Cobb.  Maybe these people who gave bad reviews should EDUCATE THEMSELVES on this history of Our Gang before trashing what they obviously don't know.

That being said, some of the video transfers are not that good, which is why I'm only giving this collection 3 stars.",1196208000,3,490,4.741176470588235

 Esp. if your from L.A. and acquainted with this area and can recognize certain areas, streets and buildings! You'd be surprised just how many! As for the DVDs themselves...well... some shorts are better quailty than others, but you expect that because this is from the 1920's!!!!

So, if you have a hankerin' to see L.A. back in its heyday and kids making their own toys to play with while invading the cops and parents too on some scratchy B&W film then this just might be for you! Roll em!",1185148800,6,740,4.625954198473282

2050591,3,B0001ZZ4PA,"Just a note to everybody:

The Little Rascals / Our Gang made almost 100 films BEFORE SOUND films were in production.  The ""Spanky & Alfalfa"" films you are familiar with are a small sampling of the total output of The Little Rascals. Unfortunately, that is mostly what was shown on television, so that is what most fans want.

If you are looking for Spanky & Alfalfe, I steer you to these Hallmark DVDs:
