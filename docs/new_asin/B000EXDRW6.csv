2542615,4,B000EXDRW6,"I loved the episodes on this DVD. I thought the Princess Ponies learned their lesson about being selfish with their argument on who should be queen when they decided to take turns in the end. A noticeable goof in Part 4 was when Wind Whistler called Locket Wind Whistler and Locket called Wind Whistler Locket, probably because they were both in the wrong place (i.e., when something fell on Wind Whistler, it was supposed to fall on Locket because Wind Whistler wouldn't question what already happened).

The Golden Horseshoes looked a tad bit odd when Mimic wasn't feeling well. Otherwise, that story was excellent with its happy ending.",1144886400,5,639,4.916666666666667
2542616,5,B000EXDRW6,I'm really excited that Rhino is relasing these episodes. When I bought the boxed set and it didn't have the Legend of the four golden horse shoes on it i was devestated! But now i can be complete! C'mon rhino now all you have to do is release The Movie and Season 3!,1144281600,5,267,4.056603773584905

2542640,3,B000EXDRW6,"This dvd is a blast from the past. It doesn't contain any of the newer ponies that my daughter has become familiar with, but she loved it just the same. She asks for Pinkie Pie everytime she watches it so I had to order another dvd that includes her but this dvd still holds her attention.",1278460800,2,289,4.178571428571429
2542641,3,B000EXDRW6,My daughter watched this movie about 3 times then was done with it :( I thought she would love it but she's more into the newer versions.,1267488000,6,137,4.111111111111111
2542642,3,B000EXDRW6,My little girl is a great fan of My Little Pony and this is the first one that she has not absolutely loved.  I am not sure why but she prefers others to this one.  The characters aren't as animated or bright as the other movies.  It almost looks like an old movie copied onto a tape.  Not sure about this one.,1262995200,3,310,3.9516129032258065

2542668,1,B000EXDRW6,This is not what one expects.  the additional stories are dark and I was very disappointed as they were not My Little Pony type stories and should not have even been on the same DVD.  PARENTS BEWARE!  The other My Little Pony DVDs were fine.,1236470400,5,241,4.311111111111111

2542672,3,B000EXDRW6,"My two year old loves Little Ponies.  We have almost all of the videos, and usually she sings along and watches without blinking.  She did not care for this one.  The characters were not as familiar and the songs not as catchy.",1193616000,,227,4.357142857142857
2542673,1,B000EXDRW6,"I was so excited to buy this video for my 3 year old daughter, as she is absolutely fascinated with My Little Pony toys, books, etc. What I never expected were the comments she made while watching it. I certainly never expected that I needed to review it for content before putting it in. When your daughter keeps saying, ""They are being really rude and mean, mommy... we should take it out..."" I knew I had a problem. The video actually scared her, as the movie is a FAR stretch from the innocence and sweetness of the other My Little Pony products. I absolutely would NOT recommend this for other children. If you do buy it... I recommend you watching it BEFORE letting your child watch it.",1174867200,9,692,4.456692913385827

2542676,5,B000EXDRW6,"I own the first season, I own the two DVDs that make up the second season, and I love them both to no end. But my question is, when will the My Little Pony Movie come out on DVD? It was one of my all time favorites, and it's a shame that right now, I don't even think that there are any plans to release it.",1145232000,4,307,3.6666666666666665

8115292,5,B000EXDRW6,This is a good movie to keep the kids quite while you are working on something in the house,1486339200,,91,3.8421052631578947
8115293,3,B000EXDRW6,"This DVD contains the first two story-lines from the second season of the '80s My Little Pony series; ""The Quest of the Princess Ponies"", and ""The Golden Horseshoes"". (Which makes the title a bit misleading, as there is only one ""other story"", not multiple ""other stories"".) The DVD ""Flight to Cloud Castle & Other Stories"" contains the rest of Season Two.

The classic My Little Pony series is a lighthearted action-adventure series with very little violence. The animation is about average for the 80s, which is to say usually adequate but with the occasional animation error. The writing is above average for the era, with many surprising plot twists; however it is weighed down somewhat by the huge cast, which makes it difficult for the writers to flesh out very many of the characters and for the viewers to keep track of them all.

""The Quest of the Princess Ponies"" is one of the better stories of the series, with a very interesting and well written plot (though there was one scene which was made somewhat confusing by the animators drawing the wrong ponies). ""The Golden Horeshoes"" on the other hand had a plot which made little sense, a prominent special effect which did not match what the characters were saying was happening, and most disturbing of all for a show intended for young children, featured the heroes stealing but failed to address the moral issues involved (granted the thefts were from somewhat villainous characters, and done for a good cause, but I still found the scene troubling).

I would recommend this DVD primarily to those who already have the Season One collection and wish to complete their classic MLP collection. Parents looking for a cheap DVD to entertain young children might also consider this DVD, however they should keep in mind that the characters and world of the classic series are completely unrelated to the current ""Friendship is Magic"" series, and they should be prepared to address the moral issues of ""The Golden Horseshoes"".",1438214400,,1983,4.913432835820895

8115296,5,B000EXDRW6,"I love the original My Little Pony. It's great for children and adults. I specifically enjoy the animation being an artist my self. I ordered this DVD from ""BACKTRAX Music, Video, Books, Etc."" and the condition was exactly the way they described it. I would definitely recommend them to anyone. However I also ordered a different My Little Pony DVD from ""Great Buy! USA"" and the condition was far from what they described. I would not recommend buying through them.",1389744000,,465,4.825
8115297,5,B000EXDRW6,"This is the other one , my grand kids watch too. it is like the first time. they love it, it is aan old movie. but they love this too. like the new ones. Thank you very much.",1372550400,,174,3.6052631578947367
8115298,5,B000EXDRW6,I remember watching this way back when I was a little girl. My two nieces have recently discovered a love for the current My Little Pony franchise so I though it would be cool to introduce them to some of the 'original' episodes. Hands down they loved it. My sister (much to her irritation ) reported they watch it all the time so my job as an aunt was done. So all in all a worthy purchase for those who want to share this with the future generation.,1367452800,,451,4.136363636363637
