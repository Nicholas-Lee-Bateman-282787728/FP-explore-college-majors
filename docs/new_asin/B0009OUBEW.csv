2307203,5,B0009OUBEW,"As a secondary English teacher, I know about the dangers regarding teacher/student relationships.  Teachers want to show students that they care, and students often need to feel like there are trustworthy adults in their lives who can assist them.
However, some people can exploit these needs for their own twisted purposes.
""Indecent Seduction"" is a true story about a young girl in a rural school who is victimized by her science teacher, Coach Nash.  Nash's charisma masks a perverted mentality in which he manipulates young girls for his own satisfaction.  It is truly shocking the amount of thhings this man was allowed to get away with! Those who try to report him are ignored because of Nash's masterful coaching techniques.  How sad that some school systems care about prestige instead of their students! Don't get me started!

This movie is heartwrenching, but there is a ray of hope as well.  The actors/actresses do very well in their roles, and Gary Cole is particularly convincing as the coach.  Please give this movie a chance.  God bless you.",1273190400,3,1057,4.965909090909091
2307204,5,B0009OUBEW,"I love the Lifetime true story movies. ""Indecent Seduction"" was one I have watched several times and really liked it. Perfect actors to play each character. Gary Cole and Nicholle Tom were great, I was crying for Nicholle(Amy) as her teacher and football coach did every trick in the book to ""love"" her and minipulate her. But a small town known for their football team was what was most important. She tried to get her life back and the whole town came down on her when coach got arrested. And he got prison time for a guilty plea. Glad to see a law passed to protect these kids.",1240099200,4,580,4.37962962962963
2307205,3,B0009OUBEW,"This movie was actually made for TV way back in the late 90's, and it's as good now as it was then. It's about a 15 year old girl who has a crush on her high school teacher, who is married with kids. He has a thing for young girls and they soon begin having an affair, and things get messy. He holds all the power and her experiences really give insight into how these teacher/student affairs work. It's a great movie with many familiar actors. It's worth seeing!",1229299200,22,463,4.213483146067416

Anyone who attended the real ""Tate"" highschool will enjoy this film.",1174780800,11,294,4.407407407407407
2307208,5,B0009OUBEW,"I saw this movie on tv and thought it was really good. I think the acting was great and why is someone giving this movie 1 star justt because they didn't receive their items?

2307217,5,B0009OUBEW,"Excellent movie! Very well done.

The story takes place in  fictional Tate High School in fictional Tate, Okalahoma, but this is a true story and it all happened in Taylor, Texas and is based on a magazine article cited in the movie credits.

Gary Cole portrays a highschool football Coach who seems to have never grown up, which Cole depicts in the movie as a mature man driving a teenager's type of pickup truck and behaving like a 17 year old himself with his flirting and worse, as well as providing the kids he liked with liquor.

In the movie, the Coach's method was to single out a young girl in his Biology class every year, always a freshman, whom he lavished with special attention and privileges, and then intentionally manipulated and coerced into a brief sexual affair that, once ended, left the teenage girl stunned and shunned by her classmates.  The irony of the story is that the Coach became completely obsessed with the last young girl he'd ever fool around with, played by Nicholle Tom, and his desperate actions to keep her to himself and control her brought him down.

Cole's portrayal of the Coach was his usual perfect performance and Nicholle Tom was riveting as the innocent young girl who was lured by flattering attention into a situation she didn't know how to stop.  The theme song, ""Oh What a Thrill"", by the Mavericks, stays in your mind long after you've watched this movie

Indecent Seduction was well done, careful to not get graphic, and portrayed the characters honestly enough.  The Coach pled guilty to a class of misdemeanor that kept him from a long prison sentence as well as allowing him to avoid graphic testimony in open court.

The young girl's parents, played exactly right by Mary Kay Place and Mac Davis, particularly Mary Kay Place as the  mother, showed them to be massively stressed out and dissatisfied with the sentence the Coach received.  Both the girl and her parents were very courageous in not giving up on bringing not only the Coach to justice but the highschool Principal and Board of Education as well.  They made history in Texas and Supreme Court case law as well, which provides a basis today for the protection of students from sexual predators and abuse of power by school teachers and administrators all over the country.",1318723200,8,2290,4.738035264483627

8064383,4,B0009OUBEW,"Coach Nash (Gary Cole) is one of the most popular teachers at Tate High School. When he pays special attention to Amy (Nicholle Tom), a 14 year-old freshman, she is flattered until he crosses the line by seducing her. Soon the rumor mill is in full swing and Amy is too ashamed to confide in anyone. The principal dismisses the suspicions because of the coach's importance to the football team. His behavior toward Amy becomes increasingly erratic and he even threatens suicide. Finally, Amy breaks down and confesses the truth to her mother (Mary Kay Place). Coach Nash pleads guilty and receives a jail sentence for his actions. But, Amy's parents feel the school system should be held responsible for failure to protect their daughter from this predator. With the help of an attorney who shares the same convictions, they are determined to set a precedent to protect other children in the future. Indecent Seduction is a captivating tale inspired by true events, featuring outstanding performances from Gary Cole, Mary Kay Place, Nicholle Tom, Mac Davis and Alyson Hannigan.",1504569600,,1077,5.022346368715084
