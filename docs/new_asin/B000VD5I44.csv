They try and do hit the major points - important historical events, the Roman military, the great leaders, the Rise and the Fall, with some details to fill in the blanks.  Good for a person with no idea about Roman history or maybe a World History class in which you needed to cover the history of Rome in one class.  But for those of you with some knowledge, who have already watched a few DVDs and absorbed a few books on Rome, this may be a waste of your time.",1319760000,,504,4.122448979591836
