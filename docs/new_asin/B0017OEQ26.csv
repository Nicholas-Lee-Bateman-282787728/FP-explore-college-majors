8266689,1,B0017OEQ26,Save your money do NOT BUY!!  So not worth paying for. I would not even watch were it something offered for FREE!!  Some movies (like this) should not even be offered for a cost to watch!!,1390780800,,188,4.194444444444445
8266690,2,B0017OEQ26,"As noted in the title, not great.  Wasn't expecting greatness, but this movie, the acting, everything was not so good.  Rent and watch at your own risk.",1357603200,,152,4.592592592592593
8266691,2,B0017OEQ26,"Beware films with reviews written by the relatives of people on the cast! Of course they are going to give it a high rating!

Overall I found it to be kind of amateur. I found myself fast forwarding a lot. I felt like it could have been more than it was. Take my review with a grain of salt as I am a very difficult person to impress.",1302048000,,334,3.911764705882353
8266692,1,B0017OEQ26,This was really not good. This is what u find on youtube for free. and 20 minutes over a finger? Paleez.,1299456000,2,104,4.0
8266693,2,B0017OEQ26,"For those of you that are seasoned investigators, this is not a movie, and it is not a professionally done documentary.  It is video footage from PSI investigators from one of their investigations in a supposed haunted house previously owned by ""Grandma and Grandpa"", who just happened to be devil worshippers.  There is only one EVP and not much technical investigating going on here.  The members of the team consist mainly of clairvoyants, sensitives, and mediums and that is what they are basing their investigation on.  There is a bonus episode at the end which takes place at what I am assuming is a mental hospital, and the investigation is based solely on what everyone is 'feeling'.  The investigators claim to have nurses and patients possessing them and walkie talkie malfunctions are taken for disembodied screams of long gone mental patients.  I found it mildly interesting, but there was a bit too much drama going on between the clairvoyants for my taste.  Not sure it's worth the $20.00 either, but if you are tired of reruns of Ghost Hunters, you might find this worth a look.",1262476800,3,1093,4.844086021505376
8266694,3,B0017OEQ26,"I love buying amateur stuff like this. This was OK overall. I did like the price point, which I think was a good purchase price. My wife didn't like it, but I am so-so about it. We are Ghost Adventures fans so we compare it to that. I was not sure if this was fiction or an investigation.

We didn't see any techniques that we would add to our investigations. We were confused on the point that the woman is a family member of the house owners but claimed she received information psychically that she could have simply witnessed growing up. I thought it was funny they argued about the alleged ghost shot since it all came down to personal perception, which is kinda the whole theme of the show.

I like that I only spent a couple dollars to get a view of what ghost investigators are doing in other locations without having to sit in on it physically.",1262390400,,853,4.325
8266695,4,B0017OEQ26,"Good investigation documentary.  Interesting uses of equipment that I wouldn't have thought to do myself. Sometimes funny. Other times spooky. Definately a good movie to own. You can watch it over and over again. I hope they make a part 2...I am curious to know more about the family, the house and its history.",1259625600,,311,4.7592592592592595
