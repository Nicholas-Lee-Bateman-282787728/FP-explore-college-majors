978282,4,6305191883,"There are two things which prevents this film from receiving the 5 stars that the contents merit.  The first and main reason is that the 130 minute running time listed gives the impression that, since this is the directors  cut, there are 47 minutes more than in the original VHS release.  This  isn't the case.  The running time for the film is totaled along with the  time for the suplemental materials.  There is no additional material in the  body of the film that I could discern (But the VHS screening copy I own may  be different from the general release copy in the video stores).  The  second gripe that I have involves the lack of letterbox.  But then again,  they may not even have a letterbox version since the original intention for  this movie was not to be shown theatrically, but on home video.",913507200,4,810,4.534722222222222

978536,5,6305191883,"Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986) is a dark and terrifying film. The opening 10 to 15 minutes are extremely effective, as we follow Henry (Michael Rooker) while he is on the prowl looking for his next victims. Intercut between this is images of the grizzly aftermath of his killings. This sets the dark mood for the rest of the film, which never lets up. We also meet Henry's acquaintance Otis (Tom Towles) who is every bit as disturbing as Henry, and they start to working together to hunt people. The film wraps up with a gut wrenching ending, that never looses its power. I've seen this film dozens of times, and it still every bit as effective as it was the first time I saw it. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of disturbing horror films. Its one of my favorites to revisit heading into the Halloween season.

Product review:
The 2009 MPI Media Group Blu Ray looks and sounds good.  Part of the thing I love about this film, is the rough grainy look. It adds to the overall creepiness for me, the same way it does for Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The Blu Ray has a good amount of interesting extras also. Especially the Henry Lee Lucas mini documentary, the real life serial killer who this film was based off of. Pretty grim stuff.",1504569600,2,1266,4.429184549356223

978542,3,6305191883,"So much for ""portrait of a serial killer""  Producers, Waleed B Ali and Malik B Ali, could have taken Ten minutes each, read up on Lucas and Toole then put together a truer to life nonfiction movie of their homicidal rampage.  Lucas never killed Toole, He did kill their traveling partner Toole's  ""niece""  Frieda Powell, not his sister as this movie proclaims.  They were just drifters picking up roofing jobs.

  The reality is Lucas really did not commit that many murders no proof of it anyway, However, he did read up on murders, some of which he knew a good bit of detail about, and used that information on law enforcement officials.  Affording him a pretty good lifestyle in prison and mini vacations to crime scene's in other states to provide murder details to detectives that they were all too happy to close.

  A friend of mine retired from U.S. Marshal's air operations, Once had the honor to accompany Lucas with detectives. He said Lucas enjoyed the attention and would say just what you wanted to hear, as long as it kept him out of his prison cell.

  This movie is a good one to watch,  I would refrain from believing anything in it as fact, other than about his mother. Who was truly about as evil as a person could be to a child.  Blaming her for his mental deterioration is the only fair and rightful thing to do.",1495324800,,1334,4.491666666666666

978675,5,6305191883,"""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is the type of movie that imparts an experience to the viewer that said viewer might not want.

A lot of reviewer have said that this is based on a true story, but I think it stands on its own as a testament to what can happen when people lose their humanity (or have none) in a civilization too often devoid of.

Henry (Michael Rooker) is a deceptively simple, quiet man who is strangely disconnected from others; this is because he is full of a horrible inner rage.  Otis (Tom Towles) plays his friend, a sick man who it might be fun to laugh at from a distance but, like Henry, has a rotten core.

There's nothing overly dramatic about the film, which is why it so horribly potent.  These two are just scumbags with absolutely no conscience.  It is the day to day experience of two natural deviants who talk dryly about their activities.  Unfortunately Otis' sister wanders into the picture, a sweet girl who only wants to experience the city, in this case a dreary and rainy Chicago with exactly matches Henry and Otis' insides.

The ending is what drives the point home.  Though much of what is said is quite ugly in this movie, it remains the unspoken that gives it an unfathomably horrible air.  Rooker and Towles are perfect, and and so is Tracy Arnold, the female actress who plays sister Becky.  This is not something I think I'd be able to watch again: not so for Rob Zombie, who comments on it most enthusiastically in the DVD version.",1494547200,,1484,4.479553903345725
978676,4,6305191883,"This was a good movie don't get me wrong. But if you know the story it's so misunderstood. This movie is the true story of Henry lee Lukas. Now they didn't involve any of his childhood drama at all. That would of help show why he was so insane. And when me was a kid till today he had an aggressively lazy eye that whey chose to not touch at all whit he pissed me off. Another thing is Henry was supposed to be fat and ugly. And they left out all the ritual, satanic and canibalisum acts that he did. Now aside for all that and a really slow start to the film it's actually not that bad.

979141,5,6305191883,"Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" made in 1986, is loosely based on Henry Lee Lucas, who confessed to murdering more than 300 people over a span of decades.

Henry (Michael Rooker) is a drifter who has left numerous bodies in his wake. He settles for a time at the run-down apartment of ex-prison mate Otis (Tom Towles) until Otis sister Becky (Tracy Arnold) turns up, fleeing her abusive marriage. Becky is attracted to Henry and looks to him as a means to get her life back on track.

This is the kind of horror film that truly horrifies. Without reference to the supernatural, alien monsters, or zombies, the film shocks by the matter-of-fact way it chronicles a depraved individual. Director John A. McNaughton uses a documentary-style objective camera to show the grim, terrifying reality of Henrys life. The film does not have the reputation of other 80s horror flicks, like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street, but it is far more powerful and definitely more unsettling.

Michael Rooker is excellent as Henry, managing to show a glimmer of humanity in the sociopaths personality. The film has no story per se. It simply observes Henry as he goes about his day, not much different from most peoples except that he randomly attacks people  sometimes out of need for release, other times because the victim annoys him. The film builds in graphic intensity, heightening tension and showing increasingly brutal killings.

Clearly, this is not everyones cup of tea. But for those who like their horror strong and unfiltered, Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer is a grisly, voyeuristic look into the mind of a madman.",1481068800,,1627,4.880434782608695

The revulsion some people feel toward this film is more do to the dark tone and realism than the gore, as any of the Saw films has considerably more bloody violence than Henry has. The home invasion scene is definitely hard to watch, but then movies about serial killers should make you uncomfortable rather than waiting for the next cool, kill scene--those movies are exploitation, while Henry is a work of art. Not for everyone of course, but a must for the brave and fans of good indie films. Michael Rooker is so great as Henry as he fits the role of lone nobody that you would never pay attention to passing in the street, which actually makes him more of a menace than an anonymous killer wearing a hockey mask. The other characters are well fleshed out as well, particularly poor Becky, who falls for Henry more out of her own desperation and disappointment with her own, terrible life. He's sort of nice to her, which it becomes clear no one else in her life has ever really been.

979481,5,6305191883,"Headline:  This is What a Horror Film Should Be

I saw this film for the first time last Saturday and I honestly have to say this may be my favorite horror film of all time. I enjoy horror, but because of dull films like Paranormal Activity, Sinister and the Insidious sequels it's not something I care to keep up with as long as dull jump scares are what studios pump out. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer was a breathe of fresh air.

In the 1980s, a film about a dude going around killing people was as common as finding Coca Cola in the soda aisle, and yet this one is able to stand out among the rest in a very big way. In my opinion, this film is so dark and gritty at times it makes Texas Chainsaw Massacre look like a children's program. The characters, especially Otis are more horrific than Freddy Kruger, Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees could ever imagine to be.

There's a brief scene with the main character following a woman walking home and the footage looks so cheap and gritty, almost like if you're watching footage from one of those machines people would put a quarter in and watch some girl show her breasts. The look and feel to me is the perfect idea of ""found footage"", where the film looks cheap but the camera is shaking around like Michael J. Fox is your cameraman.

The darkness and sticky cheap bar table top like grittiness of this film really makes the deaths in this film stand out. Once more, I have to add how slasher films ruled the 80s and how deaths meant nothing. In this film, they really stand out as something dark and disturbing. A level of uncomfortableness that probably hasn't been felt by a movie audience since Psycho is captured in this film.

There's one death scene in the film towards the beginning that felt so authentic and real that it gave me the feeling that I was watching a snuff film. A film that was made on I believe a $110,000 budget was able to capture this and yet horror films today can't even come close to this no matter the budget.

I love that this film clocks in at about an hour and twenty minutes. It really adds to the horror how this film doesn't really have time to explain itself and instead gives you the impression that you are watching a documentary where someone followed a sadistic killer around for a few days.

The ending is something I really loved because it's something that just happens without explanation. If this film was remade today, it would probably clock in at two hours and explain itself to death similar to the film Who's Next. I can only  imagine how the ending would have a ten minute flashback scene where we are beaten over the head with context.

If you're interested in seeing how a horror film is perfectly done, this is the film to see. There will never be a quality horror film as gritty and dark as Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.",1435708800,,2843,4.398095238095238
979482,5,6305191883,"Henry (Michael Rooker) is a thirty-something drifter, a nobody who is currently occupying the slummy streets of Chicago, shearing a rundown apartment with low-life friend and former inmate Otis (Tom Towles), and making ends meet working as a pest control exterminator, which coincidently, accommodates his true passion in life, that of a full fletched serial killer.
When Otis invites his estranged sister, Becky (Tracey Arnold), to live with them and to help her get back on her feet in the aftermath of a messy divorce, she comes to represent an influx which installs feelings in Henry, he didn't know he had. Otis meanwhile only has hatred and revulsion on his mind, after a botch dope deal has left him severely humiliated and Henry, a keen teacher in the arts of the macabre, is more than willing to show him the ropes when it comes to the craft of killing.
As the duo take to prowling the seedy streets of the windy city, their acts of depravity only intensifies as, especially Otis' bloodlust becomes more and more severe. But when his perversion starts to turn towards his sister, Henry feel inclined to intervene, but can he control his impulses around her or is Becky ultimately far worse off keeping Henry's company?

Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, much like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Tope Hooper, 1974), represents the absolute pinnacle in the art of low-budget filmmaking - you simply won't get it any better than this! Shot in roughly a month for approximately $100.000 with a lot of help from family members and friends, both in front of, as well as behind the camera, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer was only commissioned as a result of a planned documentary about the Chicago wrestling scene in the 1950s falling through, which then lead the executives Malik B. Ali and Waleed B. Ali of Maljack Productions, to the conclusion, that maybe the money would be better spent crafting a fictional horror film instead, and try to cash in on the popularity of the genre at that time.
They elected to keep John McNaughton (the planned director for the documentary) onboard for this new rather sketchy project and simply instructed him to go make a horror film with ""a lot of blood and gore"".
McNaughton, meanwhile was largely convinced that the relative low amount of money available to him, eliminated any and all supernatural approach to the subject matter and therefore struggled a bit to come up with an affordable scenario to center his film around. It was only after viewing an episode of the heavily sensationalistic news show, 20/20, about the exploits of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, that McNaughton decided that his monster for the film would take a human form.
It's fair to say that McNaughton weren't all that interested in reciting the factual aspects of Lucas' story, he merely used the names of Henry and his co-conspirator, Ottis Toole (which is spelled Otis in the film) and the fact that they were acquaintances that had ostensibly killed in unison as the only accurate accounts from the real life case. The character of Becky meanwhile was severely altered, presumably for dramatic effect. In real life her name was Frieda Powell and she was Ottis' twelve year old niece, whom Henry had a physical relationship with, and she furthermore partook heavily in the two men's criminal activity.
Whatever the case might be concerning McNaughton's decisions to ignore the facts of the case, it doesn't diminish what is undoubtedly an incredible powerful story in its own right. It merely ensures that the audience is afforded a far more satisfying narrative structure and resolutions pertaining to the basic character's individual arc as a consequence of the fictionalized elements incorporated. I for the life of me can't envision a more befitting ending to the film, than the one that's present in its current form, as it is unquestionably one of the most perfectly executed yet gut wrenchingly nihilistic and brutally uncompromising conclusions ever committed to celluloid.
Looking at the technical side of things, it has to be pointed out that one of the film's most appealing qualities is letting the decrepit city streets of Chicago act as the unmitigated backdrop for its deprived characters and their bleak and merciless story. It also lends the film an overwhelming sense of authenticity, that the messy milieu is captured with the sensibilities and fortitude of the cinema vrit inspired cinematography of Charlie Lieberman, who opted to shoot on gloriously grainy 16mm while not flinching for a second in bringing the viewer an up-close and personal look at the darkest corners of the human psyche.
The actors are equally impressive. Michael Rooker and Tom Towles (why isn't this guy in everything?) are both absolutely fantastic in their respective portrayals of pure unadulterated evil. All components from facial expressions and body language to delivering lines and dialogue make you certain that these are the guys, right here, in the flesh so to speak and the result is positively bone chilling.
The scene where the two sit idly by in their moldering apartment, apathetically glaring at the television screen while watching a video depicting their latest home invasion killing spree plays out, is quite simply a window's peek into hell. The character of Becky meanwhile, represents the antithesis to her malevolent male counterparts, a vulnerable naive woman, whose welfare the viewer ultimately comes to beg and plead for, as the narration plays on, which in no small part can be credited to a fantastic performance by actress Tracy Arnold. She instills the film with some much needed humanism and warmth to go along with the palpable savagery on display.
Lastly I want to mention the film's flawless score which John McNaughton's brother co-created with Ken Hale and Steven A. Jones - it is bar none, one of the most chillingly and effective of its kind.
Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is quite simply a masterpiece and a movie that no self-appointed serial killer aficionado should be without. It may be a genuinely disturbing and brutal peek into the mind of man-made monsters but it's done with a skill-set and sensibility that few motion pictures can match. An uncompromising story about the abused becoming the abusers and the tragedies and horrors they ultimately leave in their wake.
If you should feel so inclined, there is also a quite decent made-for-television movies available on DVD called Confessions of a Serial Killer (Mark Blair, 1985) which offers a more accurate account of the misdeeds of Henry Lee Lucas and company and I'll go one further in listing recommendations for that serial killer theme-night or random double bill of perversion and throw in a little known Austrian film named Angst (Gerald Kargl, 1983) which is an equally brilliant and highly unsettling home invasion style serial killer film, that should go down a treat with anyone who enjoyed Henry's exploits.
But be forewarned that Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is quite the handful on its own and as a result, it might make you crave a far more light-hearted form of entertainment the next time you reach for the shelf containing DVDs or Blu-rays.

The DVD reviewed is the R1 2-disc special edition from Dark Sky Films and it is without a doubt, the definitive version available. This release has since been re-released on Blu-ray but due to its 16mm roots it's not the most obvious upgrade if you already own this one.
The film is presented in 1.37:1 fullscreen and looks as good as it's ever going to and by that I mean that there is quite visible grain on screen, but this is as much a part of the established mood and feel of the film as everything else present, and should therefore be revered not criticized.
The audio is a clear-cut 2.0 Stereo track which does the job of handling both the music and sound effects perfectly.
The extras are plentiful, beginning with a feature length audio commentary with director John McNaughton, who proves to be a great talker. He goes into vast details discussing the film and the production in an informative and detailed oriented manner, resulting in a chat track that easily holds ones interest for the duration of its runtime.
`Portrait: The Making of Henry' follows suit and is an excellent new documentary clocking in at roughly 52 minutes. It offers interviews with the cast and crew, behind the scenes photos and clips, and does an exceptional job of filling us in on the origins of the film and the evolution that it went through during production.
Up next is a documentary running half an hour, entitled `The Serial Killers: Henry Lee Lucas' which offer a startlingly honest glimpse at the real life inspiration for the film, Henry Lee Lucas, who claims to have murdered over 350 people (this is a highly debatable claim, however). It's a fascinating watch, although it's obviously a very low-budget production that suffers from some poor and sometimes misguided choices regarding the visual style as well as highly amateurish music cues. Through recreation footage and interviews with some of the men involved, including Lucas himself, it does a nice job of covering the details of not only his killing spree but also his trial and the circus that it would eventually become.
There's also a 20 minute selection of deleted scenes and outtakes from the film, minus an audio track sadly, but the footage is available with a running commentary by director John McNaughton and although this isn't the most exciting material, it's still nice to see it included, if nothing else than for the sake of completion.
Furthermore there's an interview from 1998 with John McNaughton lasting 30 minutes, where he talks about the horror films that has inspired him, the making of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, the legacy of the film and working with the various cast and crewmembers. Rounding out the extras is a wealth of original storyboards and stills and the film's original theatrical trailer - a fantastic package for a truly remarkable film.

Hope you enjoy (if that's the right phrase) it.",1435449600,2,10089,4.944018856806128

I read about this movie years ago, when I was too young to see it on my own and knowing it would not come to my little old Texas theatre -- so I waited for a few years for it to turn up at Blockbuster and it was so worth the wait.  Mr. Rooker deserved an Oscar for this but the movie was so unflinchingly cruel I suppose it turned off a lot of the uptight Academy voters.  Rooker's simplistically quiet Henry belies a cruel savage streak, that becomes more worse when he conspires with his partner Otis.  The movie just feels dirty, the characters all broken and damaged people.  However, where Otis seems completely devoid of any shred of humanity, Henry displays some type of sensitivity and humanity.  It is Rooker's skill that makes Henry more than a one-dimensional perverted killer; he imparts a sense of vulnerability and hurt but don't be fooled -- ultimately, Henry has become a stone-cold killer.  A classic scene involves a television, horrific and darkly amusing only because you laugh because it is so horrible.  Terrifying is the home invasion and the brutality of Henry and Otis is frightening to behold (and so sad for the family).  No one is safe from these men, they will turn on anyone, even each other.  I can't see how anyone would regret watching this.  This should have been a star turn for Michael Rooker but instead most know him a Merle Dixon from THE WALKING DEAD (yes, still a great role).  He is absolutely fabulous in this and this is a great movie -- one of my all-time favorites. (I met Michael Rooker at a horror con and told him I loved Merle but I was crazy for Henry; he autographed my Henry DVD and told me hardly anyone asks him about Henry, what a shame I thought.)",1389052800,2,1757,4.422360248447205

980022,3,6305191883,"I had always heard that this was supposed to be a pretty disturbing film. Of course I couldn't wait to get my hands on this baby and when I did I agreed with the majorities voice, but what exactly IS it that makes this little film so deep?

Henry is your all around dysfunctional serial killer. While America drools over clever psychological romps as in Silense of the Lambs, or the con artist Ted Bundy who appears like anyone's next door neighbor, there's nothing entertaining about Henry. He's cold, realistic, insane. He is mild mannered and seems normal enough, quiet and almost reserved most of the time. But he has no remorse whatsoever.

 His sidekick/friend in the motive, Otis, is just as nutty but in a more sexually perverted fashion. Sister Becky shows up to stay. While she's not violent and knows nothing about Henry and dear brother's actions, she doesn't exactly have all her eggs in one basket either. She starts falling in love with Henry and he's uncharacteristically nice to her. What exactly does this mean?

 Henry kills indiscriminately. No pattern makes him harder to catch. His IQ isn't high either. But unlike a lot of other serial flicks out there - this one is soley on Henry and Otis. No police, detectives, victims, victims families. Only the two of them.

 This isn't an extremely violent flick as in Henry doesnt just go around killing people. But when it happens, it sure happens, and its disturbing. Especially the family scene. The ending was surprising. I think that, like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other disturbing flicks, you don't have to pile on the gore to get the point across, just use clever directing.

This movie began as another low budget flick but excels because it adequately explores the disturbing folks out there. You get a sense that what is happening is realistic, and it turns out to be a form of psychological study. Surprisingly this movie includes mucho drama in its execution; near the end of the film you're waiting to see if the main character turns around or not. It's hard to explain without having had seen the film, but there is a small possibility he will to some viewers when watching the scenes, and so the ending was a perfect touch on how it all really went down. As moral human beings we believe in the good of people to an extent, and it's hard to see how someone couldn't be capable of any love at all, which is what I believe the director toys with in some of the final acts.

Michael Rooker did his part expertly. No one could have carried off the role of Henry better. Tom Towles as Otis was also convincingly creepy. Becky, although her character was a bit irritating in her simple ness and naivety (which in a way was the point) was played out well by Tracy Arnold.

Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, was loosely based on the life of real time serial killer Henry Lee Lucas. While in real life the man did have a sidekick named Otis, what went down in the film was basically pure fiction. I think they were trying to make a point more than an accurate account. The two together were enough to give anyone the chills, and in a way it seemed Otis was the crueler of the two, more demented. What happened to the real Becky was not at all like the film either (she was actually under the age of 18 and taken against her will, and in real life Otis was more the master mind), but they used all the characters to make a realistic type of flick that worked in disturbing the audiences and capturing some of the almost unreal emotions these kinds of people sometimes have.

Do yourself a favor and watch Henry. Not ""entertaining"" but interesting. And what true horror is all about: the monster behind the mask of man.",1379635200,,3697,4.544360902255639

980165,5,6305191883,"The 4 and 5 star reviews here so well capture my feelings about the movie--which I think is brilliant, disturbing, haunting, etc etc--that I'm not really going to review 'Henry' itself, but rather address myself to the reviewers who hated it. Not just as a rebuttal, but partly as a warning to others thinking of buying the film based on misconceptions of what it's all about, who might then flood the board with more 1 star reviews that are based less on an evaluation of the film itself, than disappointment that it isn't what they bought it thinking it was going to be.

The main complaint seems to be that 'Henry' isn't scary, and doesn't hold up to other horror/slasher flicks. The reason for this may be that it isn't a horror/slasher flick. If you get nothing else from what I'm saying, get that. For the record, I like well-crafted movies in that genre. I like movies that keep me jumpy, on the edge of my seat, with sudden freak-out-scary-someone-coming-out-of-nowhere-with-a-butcher knife moments, gory murders that you relish watching and are grossed out by at the same time. But even though there are a lot of killings in, say, 'Schindler's List', that isn't exactly the feel you'd expect or want from that film, and it isn't what anyone should expect from this one.

The deliberately blunt, crude title is probably part of the issue, along with other fragmentary things the 1-star critics heard regarding the basic plot, because it's obvious that some people viewed it expecting something the movie wasn't intended to be. Maybe I was lucky, because from what little I heard about ""Henry"" before seeing it, I didn't go in thinking the title character was being set up as the new Jason or Freddy Krueger. In fact, I was expecting a slow, contemplative character study with lots and lots of talk; I actually didn't know that I'd be seeing any killings at all onscreen, which made what I did see all the more shocking. I wasn't 'scared' when Henry and Otis slaughtered the nice, suburban family; in fact, the static framing of the scene seemed intended to deprive the viewer of any pleasurable sense of fright and excitement of the kind a different film with a scene like this would convey. Instead, you just have a grim, purposely flat and steady view of the madness and horror within the still framing shot. You're not allowed to enjoy it, or even experience any suspense (you already know how it's going to turn out), you're just a witness.

Anyway, no need to go on. I just wanted to steer any unsuspecting, misdirected and potentially disappointed viewers away from ""Henry"" and back to Saw XXIII or whatever number they're up to now.

Oh,and if you haven't seen 'Schindler's List' but are planning to, be aware there is no ominous background music, creepy subjective camera shots from the point of view of the killers, and Hitler never jumps out and yells ""Boo!"" So when you write your reviews of that one, I don't want to hear any complaints that Steven Spielberg doesn't measure up to John Carpenter or Rob Zombie.",1376352000,3,3030,4.743833017077799

One of the best & most realistic serial killer movies ever committed to film, ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer,"" was quite controversial in it's day. A realistic film that hits to close to home, as Henry could be anyone that walks past you on the street, or sits next to you on a bus. Henry could be your normal next door neighbor, who is far from normal. Quiet & calm on the outside. Pure vicious rage on the inside. Henry is a apex predator. His prey, humans. His triggers are many & nobody is safe.

Not a sensational slasher type film, but all the more potent because it's not. ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer"" brings us in the dark world of a monster, that also happens to be human, & are not human monsters always the most disturbing?",1371081600,,780,4.335616438356165

980364,5,6305191883,"I don't know when this was set exactly, but looks like 70's, early 80's -- but it's not distracting once you get into the story.

This is a disturbing film on many levels, but significantly so, b/c it doesn't focus on the apprehension of the killer.  There's no sleuthing detective on his tail armed with a styrofoam cup and a pesky migraine, no concerned family members, ...it's just all about the rotten, empty world of the killer that no one seems to care about and a continuous stream of bodies gruesomely posed for our discovery.  He moves so quickly that, at first, we don't even experience the violence...it's just an echo of the past as he's already moved on to the next victim.

Technical/Plot issues (Read after you've seen the movie!):  The audio track separates from the action for a bit mid-way, but then gets back in sync.
This guy was in prison then let out as an adult -- so he's ""in the system"" yet he's leaving fingerprints and dna everywhere.  But this reflects our 21st century views.  As the 70's/ early 80's were without huge databases and desktop computers to run searches of prints and connect all the dots.  Also, the character acknowledges ""gotta keep moving"" so they don't catch up -- which may be more plausible since interstate communications are a known problem even today (as far as I know).

Which leads me to my last quibble.  A self-aware serial killer? Perhaps.  But this is unlikely given what we know about serial killers.  He seems to have analyzed the downfalls of other serial killers and applied this to his own activity to elude capture.  Murderers, including serial killers, aren't dispassionate about what they do....it's driven by emotion/rage/control etc.  Otherwise they wouldn't do it -- they'd be an accountant.  Indeed, emotional motivation is developed in Henry's story line and we indeed witness impulsive actions.  Emotion is unpredictable and hard to control and this leads to mistakes, impulsive actions, and capture.  As far as I know.  Perhaps there are indeed a league of Henry's roaming about....undetected....that would mean a lot of bodies.  Keep your eye out (not like the guy in the movie...).",1363478400,5,2156,4.873626373626373
980365,5,6305191883,This movie is a low budget masterpiece.  You will either hate it for the lack of gore or love it for the fact that it leaves you with that haunted feeling only good movies can deliver.  It is a look into the life of a serial killer who kills without any remorse as if it's a hobby.  While they do show some violence we are spared the gore and instead the film makers focused on showing the callusness of a serial killer as he selects his victims or just kills on a whim.  Michael Rooker who plays Henry (and Merle from Walking Dead) gives a very believable performance as a cold blooded killer. The rest of the acting is a little lacking but his acting and the whole creepy premise of the movie make it a great film.  This movie leaves you knowing that simple choices like letting an unfamiliar yet friendly face into your home can end your life.  These creeps are out there blending in while killing people like it's nothing.  It will and should make you be more aware of your surroundings.,1361404800,3,991,4.324324324324325
980366,5,6305191883,"I first saw Henry: when I was around 13 or 14, my brother and I used to show horror/sci-fi films at a comic-con in Pittsburgh.  Some of the classics I'd stick around for and watch year after year were Dawn Of The Dead, Phantasm, Clockwork Orange (we'd sneak that in as ""sci-fi""), Evil Dead trilogy etc.  When we would pop in the Henry VHS I'd pay attention for 10 minutes or so before leaving the room and trying to score some liquor at one of the many parties being thrown in various rooms.

I don't think it was until I was 19 that I sat down and fully paid attention to this shockingly real film, that's what makes it so horrifying is that this could happen any day, anywhere, in any city or small town.  This is what scares me, not zombies or demons or ghosts, what scares me are the people with no comprehension of sympathy or compassion.  The acting is this movie, I mean it doesn't even feel like acting - it feels like a documentary, I can't think of any lines or scenes that come off phony.  I knew people like this being a child of the 80s and growing up in a lower-class, and I'll say it, white trash neighborhood.

Amazingly, if you think Henry is about as base as a human being can get, wait until you meet Otis.  This movie is heavy.  Have you ever seen Apocalypse Now?  Heavy right?  This is like Apocalypse Now only the war is in Henry's brain and the commies are winning

tell you what, this movie gave me the creeps; it seemed so real.  i left the movie in the end, feeling so uncomfortable--like i was a willing participant (as an observer  in something incredibly and inconceivably  ugly--that i can't get it out of my mind 20 years hence.

980524,4,6305191883,"Why is this movie so disturbing? Why does it trouble people so much, considering low budget and a lack of special effects? I believe, it is because the human mind and a persons emotions demand reason and they demand answer. However, both Henry as a character and an entire film, gives us none. People want to know why, why did Henry Lee Lucas murder innocent people? Why is the fictional Henry randomly killing? WHY? There is no answer and that is why this film works. It works because you rarely see any real violence or gore in this film, yet your mind acts as a canvas for a film that paints with a lot of dark colors.  I also tip my hat to Michael Rooker, a relative unknown at the time, as this was only his second film, he really captures the essence of this film. The scene in which he is talking to Becky about his mother, her cheating on his handicapped father, his deceased brother and the murder of his mother, he does so with such an emptiness, that truly captures the film. Other characters as Ottis and Becky are there for the sake of keeping an extremely loose spin on real life Henry Lee Lucas but they're not that important. Frankly, Ottis comes off as a moronic closet homosexual pedophile who I don't believe murders for the reason Henry does. He murders because he is just a complete idiot and a follower being Henrys lap dog. While Becky on the other hand is a follower like her brother, lusting over men with abuse issues. (i.e a husband charged with murder and Henry). In fact, if the film just featured Henry, I feel it would work just as well, so I congratulate him on a tough performance well executed.

Now, I won't spoil anything big but I must discuss the end. It is simple and anti climatic, it just simply...ends. Frankly, I feel it has to, that way it doesn't contradict the message it was trying to get through for the past eighty-five minutes. You see, while this movie has a story and is about the mind of this disturbed man, the movie is about nothingness, the lack of reason, emotions, thoughts, responsibility for his actions or his remorse for them. This movie will not teach you anything, you will not view the world in new ways, unless it is a bleaker view of it. The point is, he is a man who murders people, films it, watches it and enjoys bringing others down to his level without even realizing it. His personality is best summed up best by the opening scene, which focuses from random murder victims to Henry committing mundane and normal activities. You could watch only that three minute scene and go away with the complete idea behind the film.

Finally and in conclusion, I rate this film four out of five. I had an emotional reaction to the film, it made its point with as much ease and grace as a film about pointless murdering can. Yet, at the end of the day I don't know if you can like this film. In fact, I doubt anybody could say they had an enjoyable experience watching this film. I think if you want to see a real disgusting and ugly side of the world that exists in reality, I recommend it and I think it will humble you but I don't know if you can like. You can appreciate it and see it for what it is. However, I think this is a film that doesn't want you to like it, in actuality, for it to work, it needs you to not like it.",1312934400,,3289,4.310177705977383

980722,5,6305191883,"After 20 years, Henry remains one of the most compelling horror films ever made. The basic premise - a slice of life approach to the daily activities of a serial killer - had been done before (Bill Lustig's nauseating ""Maniac"") as well as since (the overrated ""Man Bites Dog""), but none approached the impact or verisimilitude of John McNaughton's chiller.

Michael Rooker's intense offering is probably the only rendition of a serial killer that gives me nightmares. He seethes with rage and internal brokenness, and with the character of Otis, Tom Towles creates an inimitable caricature of a grotesque clown. Observing his progression from tortured accomplice to drooling necrophiliac is both disturbing and, occasionally, hilarious. In the audio commentary, McNaughton points out the humor that can be appreciated if you can tolerate the stench long enough to locate it. In the most reductive sense, Henry and Otis can be viewed as homicidal buffoons. Their reparte - particularly a post murder bit in a fast food parking lot, and Otis' ""slow on the uptake"" response when Henry hands him a gun in order to kill somebody - can be viewed as nihilistic Abbott and Costello bits.

The film's shortcomings mostly enhance its impact. The lack of funds necessitated a harsh, occasionally underlit 16mm look that makes the goings-on all the more realistic. This film is a masterpiece of aesthetic minimalism. Few directors have made equally powerful films under the umbrella of slick hollywood productions.

The DVD presentation is first rate. The transfer is clear, and the supplements - particularly a cache of deleted scenes, and a thorough doc present on a second disc - include pretty much everything a ""Henry"" fan could ask for.",1258070400,7,1730,5.106007067137809

Some will be turned off big-time with the shocking brutality of this film, but that's what it is about - a cold-blooded killer (Michael Rooker, playing real-life killer Henry Lee Lucas) with seemingly no conscience, and a stupid partner (Tom Towles as ""Otis Toole""), who is almost as immoral.

""Chilling"" is a good word to describe these two guys.

The only part of the movie which was repugnant to me was the scene in with Rooker and Towles break into a house, terrorize a woman and videotape it.

There are only three main actors in this film: Rooker, Towles and Tracy Arnold as a real dumb-but nice-but trashy kid sister of Otis, ""Becky. ""  All three are extremely interesting.

The rest of the people in the film are all victims of those two guys who go on a killing spree that is almost a daily occurrence for a short time. It's absurd, but that's the story.

About ten years ago, in college, I gathered with some friends to watch a movie that we had rented purely because the title had us laughing.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Spit-On-Your-Grave/dp/B0002CHIJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Spit On Your Grave</a>&nbsp;was the name of it, and to this day, it remains one of the most disturbing horror films I've ever seen.  Even though it doesn't presume to be filmed for real on camcorder or through the lenses of security video, it seems so true, the acting is so flawless, and the stylism is so harsh and unforgiving that all of us in that dormroom were left horrified and silenced by what we saw.

I bring that up here because HENRY is attempting the same thing.  Brutal, sere, and almost casually grotesque, the movie doesn't thrill with zoom cuts or false scares or even slow trawls around dark corners.  It doesn't care about building tension or creating suspense.  It just shows you what happens.  And what happens is people die.

You could watch the film and wonder what the point is, and you might be right.  I know people who would argue that the movie has a lot to say about humanity, or disassociation, or the emptiness of the modern human spirit.  Whatever.  I won't discount that, but I doubt it's anything but someone trying to dress up a hog in fine linens.  The makers of this film wanted to scare their viewers with an unflinching look at soullessness and hunger.  To torture the metaphor (ahem), they realized that some people just like hog, without all them fancy clothes on.

Although I appreciated the stylism and spirit of the film, I left it feeling as if it were unfinished.  That was probably intentional.  Henry, unlike so many serial killers, doesn't murder for attention, or out of ritual, or as a cry for help.  He murders much in the same way you or I might, say, splash water on our faces.

I wasn't sure which edition to pick up, since there are multiples, but I know that he's a big movie buff -- wants the ""bells and whistles"" version with commentaries, associated documentaries, special features galore, and so forth.  When it arrived and he opened it, he was ecstatic, because this edition has all of those included.

Henry Lee Lucas is one of the lesser-known serial killers in the US, and anyone who's interested in true crime stories, serial killers, or simply likes dramatic horror, this is a good choice.  Plenty of explanation about him in the movie as character narrative without getting boring, and doesn't drag out more than we want to know.  It's a good glimpse into a chunk of his life, and truly shows who he and his associates were.

The movie itself is a little rough, visually, but most movies made in the '70s fall into that category.  Considering the era, the special effects are phenomenal, with the victims showing just enough blood to be a mild shock, but not so much that it becomes almost ridiculous gore (as some movies go with).

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this version over a lesser single-disc version, simply because it goes into the story behind the story for those who are interested in getting ""the full story"" or those who've never heard of Henry Lee Lucas before and wonder who he was.",1232668800,,1438,4.678571428571429

980949,4,6305191883,"It's safe to say that films like `Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer' tend to make you feel, what's the word; unsafe.  The reason for this is that `Henry' is the type of film that doesn't glamorize or sugarcoat anything.  It is not a film that feels Hollywood made, thus killing its `this is only fiction' type stance.  `Henry' feels so gritty, so raw and so real that one cannot help but feel the skin crawl while they are watching it.  Case-in-point; my doorbell rang while I was in the middle of watching this movie, and no one EVER comes to my house (this was like 2 in the afternoon mind you, so it's not like it was `dark' out or anything).  I was petrified.  I did answer the door, and no one killed me (obviously) but I was truly terrified.

This movie will have that effect.

The film is loosely based on the real life murders of Henry Lee Lucas, a man whose life will seriously depress and disgust you (if you ever get the chance to look into the true life account of this man I recommend you do, especially if you have seen this movie, for it sheds a whole new light on the subject).  It follows drifter Henry as he joins forces so-to-speak with ex-convict Otis.  Otis is a vile creature, maybe even more so than Henry (who at least appears to have some morals when it comes to dealing with people he is not killing), who is living with his recently separated sister Becky.  Becky has lived a life of abuse as well, starting with her father and escalating when she married the father of her child.  In order to escape her husband she left her child with her mother and came to live with Otis, but Otis is as mentally abusive as they come, and seems to have eyes of lust for his sister.

Becky falls in love with Henry, for he seems vulnerable and wounded and in this the have a common bond.  He is nice to her and he respects her and he defends her against the advances of her brother Otis.

What she doesn't know is that Henry and Otis have unleashed their inner rage on countless random victims, abusing and terrorizing and murdering as many as they can get their hands on.

The film is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, haunting and disturbing.  That goes without saying.  What is a little disappointing to me is the delivery of the film.  The films title suggests something a little more to me than what we are provided with.  It is titled `Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer' and to me, I don't really get the portrait I was expecting.  The film would have been much more effective had the psyche of this demented and tormented man been truly fleshed out and examined.  Instead, director John McNaughton seems more interested in dissecting his murderous rampage.  We see that his selection was random, and that he focused his attention on women, and it is hinted towards the fact that his rage is inspired by his physical arousal, but perhaps these suggestions are too subtle.  As we watch Henry fall in love with Becky it is suggested that this relationship makes him rethink his desire to kill, but again, perhaps this is too subtle.

I am a fan of subtlety, but when we are dealing with the mental fibers of a human being it become necessary to expose them a little fuller, for what is meant to be subtlety can be interpreted as non-existent.

I also was not a fan of the musical score, which came off as B-grade and cheap and made the film feel like a `straight to video' type trashy thriller.  The decision to shoot the film as a collection of vignettes was effective to an extent, but not entirely advantageous.  It added layers of grit and reality (another example of this use was in Todd Field's `In the Bedroom', where the vignettes helped create a feeling of everyday life) it also took away at times from the horror of the happenings on the screen.  It was almost like `that's done now, let's move on' and it may have been more effective to allow the audience to linger a bit more.

Regardless of the director's decisions, the casting of Michael Rooker was genius.  The man looks like your next door neighbor and so his revelation is all the more chilling.  His portrayal of Henry as a broken and tortured soul is amazing, for he grabs you where it counts, creating a festering, menacing individual who is as tormented as the people he torments.  He also manages to capture his character's apathetic attitude towards his actions, without ever loosing the manipulated sympathies we are forced to feel for him.  When he bares his calculated soul to Becky we are given a glimpse of the misery this man has been through, yet at the same time, as his story changes and his emotions are bore we can see that this man is pure evil.

Brilliant performance.

I wish that a little more thought had been given to the exposure of this man, as a man and not a killer, for then I feel that the audience would have a greater idea of what type of man would kill in this manner.  Rooker does a fine job of doing what the script fails to do, but a little more attentiveness on the part of McNaughton could have really elevated this otherwise remarkably haunting film.  This is not a film for everyone, and while most of the violence is done off-screen, the aftereffects are disturbing and gut-wrenching so be forewarned, this will cause you grief.",1226275200,2,5251,4.43125

980951,5,6305191883,"Since millions of words have already been written about this film I've decided to take another approach, ammie permitting. I intend to compare it to another film about a murderer who is an Evil Genius, a film which the masses have seen fit to honor while living in blissful ignorance of the existence of John McNaughton's classic portrayal of two dull normal rednecks engaged in roughly the same line of work. I may have to be tricky about this since ammie doesn't like it when you say things that aren't nice about other films. You may have to guess the title and a few other things about the film.

My first objection is to the use of the Evil Genius concept in the film we shall call SOTL. The Evil Genius is an extremely trite concept and probably fairly far removed from reality, but its does seem to be one that the public embraces. Is it because it makes them feel more secure in their day to day lives to believe that it would take such a Genius to off them? Possibly. But the truth of the matter is that most serial killers are probably more like the ones portrayed in HENRY--two fairly normal, everyday guys of the variety you see and dismiss lightly all the time. And that is exactly what makes them so adept at what they do, they can pass by you unobserved. Single you out at the gas station, check your power meter, spray your house for roaches. No Evil Geniuses here--just two vicious killers who are much better at what they do than you are at staying alive.

The cast of SOTL has also been singled out for all kinds of recognition and awards while the cast of HENRY has had to content itself with playing second fiddle even within the realm of Horror where the awards also went to SOTL. Was the other truly the better film with the superior cast? No, but it was the film with the more famous, internationally recognized cast and that always seems to impress folks when it comes time to hand out the awards. The Main Star of SOTL played his role to the hilt with so much hammy verve that Orthodox Jews were unable to see the film because of his performance. Perhaps it was the type of role that called for such a performance. Compare it however, to Michael Rooker's interpretation of Henry in PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER and you will clearly see that it IS possible to be just as threatening and unnerving by playing it the other way. Rooker is so quiet, so polite---""Henry was always such a quiet boy""--that it makes what is inside him seem all the more ugly and (more importantly) all the more REAL. Reality is what scares me, not some comic book caricature of reality. And the horrible beauty of HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER is that every single moment of it rings true, especially Rooker's performance.

This ""review"" presupposes that you have seen this film. What follows contains a MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT  that will totally ruin the film for you if you have not seen it!*****

SOTL never once surprised me. It was a by the book film, but HENRY--whoa! That was a shocker! The film a was more or less true account of Henry Lee Lucas and Otis Toole, two famous serial killers who have since gone to their just rewards. So the questions arises, how do you surprise and shock a jaded audience that already knows exactly what your film is about and how it must end? (At the time Lucas was in jail in Texas awaiting execution and Toole was locked up in Florida doing the same.) The answer turned out to be simple, McNaughton led us down the primrose path! In short he allowed us to believe that's what we were seeing, but he never once mentioned the names LUCAS and TOOLE, just Henry and Otis and Becky. We assumed the rest since most of the film did fit in with the facts we knew about them, which meant that when the film reached its real climax with Henry's murder of Otis--we were all out of our seats screaming ""NO, THAT CAN'T HAPPEN!"" or just sitting there frozen in stunned silence. Absolutely brilliant!******END OF SPOILER*****

Lastly I'd just like to mention the one scene in this film that did manage to scare me, and as I've said only 3 films have ever managed to scare me; this one, THE THING (the original when I was 4 and 1/2), and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. It comes near the end of the film right after Becky has been coming on to Henry and to avoid her he decides to ""go out for some cigarettes"" which usually means that someone is about to die a horrible death. We follow him nervously as he walks to the store where he encounters a rude clerk and a couple of other people who give him lip, but he just ignores them. Then as he's going back to the apartment he runs into an old woman walking her yappy little dog. He stops to talk to her and of course she's rude too, and then SHE TURNS HER BACK ON HIM AND WALKS DOWN A DARK ALLEY! What on earth possessed this woman? Henry looks around to see if anyone is watching and then starts to follow her--we know its going to happen soon---and then he just changes his mind and goes back to the apartment. Just like that. Murder Interruptus.

Now I know a lot of you are going ""What's so scary about that?"" Well maybe its a female thing. I think at sometime or another every female has suspected that somebody really weird has been following her and its been bad enough to really spook her, but then she felt relieved because he turned off. Oh good,  she thinks,I was wrong he was never following me at all. Well, after this movie you can't help but think, if only for a moment, maybe that freak really was following me after all. And if you're not thinking that, maybe you should be. (Cue scary music)",1225065600,4,5581,4.369942196531792

980953,4,6305191883,"Henry is former convict who served in prison for killing his mother when he was just 14. A mother that abused and neglected him for years by forcing him to wear dresses and making him watch her have sex with strangers. We don't see this, it's merely implied by Henry when talking with the sister of his friend and roomate Otis, Becky who stops by live with the two for a while. This explains Henry's hatred for women and why most of his victims are such. He shows a genuine revulsion to any physical contact with women when he is seen killing a hooker in the backseat of Otis' car and when Becky kisses him during a home video session where he looks uncomfortable and wipes his mouth off.

Otis stands more as composite degenerate type with almost every type of sexual perversion that one can muster. He makes advances on young boys he sells drugs to, attempts necrophilia on a dead woman he just killed and is constantly making incestuous advances on his sister Becky only to be stopped by Henry who again shows revulsion to any kind of sex. However at first, he is not a killer until Henry shows him the way and enlightens him to the ""rush"" of the kill.

Under the ""teachings"" of Henry, the two go on a spree of killing random victims in different ways so not to leave a modis operande. A good samaritan is shot when fooled into thinking the two have car trouble. An illegal appliance salesman is stabbed with a soldering iron and having a TV smashed over his head. And in the most disturbing scene in the film, we see an entire family slaughtered in their own home as photographed from a video camcorder they stole from the murdered salesman. We then see them sitting on the sofa watching this video and drinking beer like they were watching the Super Bowl!

Sound powerful and disturbing? You bet! Writer/director John McNaughton holds nothing back in this realistic portrayal of diseased minds. Forget Jason, Michael and Freddy who are just fantasy killers with supernatural qualities that seemed to have just come out of adult comic books. This is loosly based on the exploits of real life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas (who claimed to have killed over 300 people).

The film is made in a sort of quasi-documentary style reminiscent of William Freidken's style in The Exorcist, using hand-held cameras and minimal lighting to give it grit and realism. The opening shot is that of a naked woman lying somewhere in a field with blood on her. Then we switch over to Henry doing his day-to-day activities and as he does this, we see brief shots of other various mutilated female corpses juxaposed while hearing the sounds of the murders that took place earlier. I consider this to be the best sequence in the whole film.

McNaughton made this film in 1985 for a mere $100,000 in his hometown Chicago but was not released until four years later. The MPAA refused to give it an R rating due to it's disturbing content so the film was shelved. Like George A. Romero's 1977 classic Dawn of the Dead, it eventually got released as unrated with no one under 17 admitted. It was this film along with Peter Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover that sparked the debate on a new rating that eventually brought in the NC-17 rating.

The acting is top notch, the then unknown Michael Rooker gives a real chilling performance as the title character along with Tom Towles as the goofy but sick Otis. Rooker went on to do several acclaimed films like Mississippi Burning and JFK. Towles moved on to mostly TV most notably with his recurring role as the internal affairs investigator in NYPD Blue.

Critical reaction was mixed when released, some critics like Ebert praised it for it's unflinching look into a killer's head. Others savaged it as exploitation gone way over the top. You be the judge. Scary? Not really, but very disturbing and it won't leave your head anytime soon after watching it.",1212278400,,3904,4.61671469740634

980955,5,6305191883,"John Mac Naughton's cult low-budget film is beyond any fictional story about murder and sociopaths. Beyond any logic explanation about the behaviour or consequences of brutal, cruel and random violence. Beyond the self awareness of one-self in front of a mirror, beholding the remaining pieces of a shattered human soul and a deep buried self-estime.

This provoking and disturbing raw true-crime drama was based loosely on the story of the serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, portrayed with devastatingly insightful talent by Michael Rooker in a career performance, and considered back in 1986 as a response to the slasher genre ruling  at the time, based on horror fantasy supernatural characters and socking gory visuals. I can affirm with fair arguments, this film is the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" of the 80's, because leaving beside the obvious astethics, style or generic differences between both masterpieces, they share the monumental task of disturbing the very essence of primal fear, the very core of insecurity and peace of mind,  in the most macabre possible way: The de-humanization of the murderer who shows no passion, no reasons and no existential issues except for the haunting of the past that made him a monster.

Henry and his roommate Otis (Tom Towles) selects their innocent victims and torture them till the most brutal and violent deaths ever portrayed on film. The videotaping of the killings represented extreme sadism inside a crude sadistic story. The graphic violence of the film prevented the theatrical release untill 1990. By that time it was compared to masterpieces like ""silence of the lambs"" because of its lurid, grim and creepy atmosphere and a menacing but downbeat humor.

This movie was the first film that made me feel safe behind the screen and grateful for the life i had,  after the first and almost unbearable viewing. Such crudety and menacing tension attacks with relentless strenght  the very foundations of  the meaning of  life in this cruel world. The devastating effects of a traumatized life in the confessions of the killer don't mean nothing compared to his brutal actions. There's no possible sympathy for this human shell covering a rotten heart, hell awaits this inhuman tormentor.

My fair recomendation for fans of disturbing and violent crime-drama, who will found in ""Henry: Portrait of a serial killer"" a cult masterpiece with no paralel or possible accurate reference in film history because of the harsh atmosphere capted in this low-budget passionate work.

This 20th aniversary DVD edition is a must-have, i own a previous one but i look forward to watch the flawless remasterization and extras, including the interviews with John Mc Naughton, who owes me a couple of  good night sleep and long hours trying to recover myself.",1207267200,6,2790,5.148230088495575

Whether it's Jason killing stupid teenagers for the millionth time, or watching Captain Rhodes in Day of the Dead get torn in half by zombies to the delight of audience, I never get a feeling of unease, nor do I ever wonder why am I watching this. But Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer was the first horror film that really made me uncomfortable to watch but in a good way. This is a horror film where the monster is not a creature from the pits of hell, but actually the guy who lives down the block from us.
The plot is so simple: Henry, played to perfection by Michael Rooker, is a nomadic serial killer going from place to place taking his anger on random victims while at the same time, just seen as the guy next door. He shacks up with his ex con buddy Ottis and his sister and is seen as a man with a haunted past. When Ottis sees Henry kill two hookers for almost no reason, Ottis gets drawn into his world and the viewer is along for the ride. Henry even explains to Ottis and the viewer the do's and don'ts of killing people
One of the most disturbing scenes is where the two men go to a guys garage to buy a tv. The fat guy selling the stolen sets is seen as so disgusting that I wanted something bad to happen to him. When they do kill him, it is done in such a realistic way that it made me feel like I was witnessing an actual murder that happened at some point in time. Even when Henry and Ottis use a video camera to record the brutal (key word) murder of a mother father and son, it made me feel like I wanted to take a shower and not even think about it again.
This movie is an amazing example of low budget film-making that puts the audience right into the mind of a serial killer who is just as realistic as modern monsters like Gary Heidnik, Leonard Lake and Charles Ng and more. The one thing you could say about this movie is that the film never comments on the after effects of murder or even about why Henry is committing these horrible acts. Great Movie",1204070400,,2043,4.11
981169,3,6305191883,"A lot of things were going through my mind after I watched this film. I wondered why I was drawn to it; I suppose it's because the movie was highly rated. There is no ambiguity about the type of film it is, based on the title. You pretty much know that you are going to see some brutality and blood. It's an example of the kind of thing I would never watch when my wife or kids were present. That concerned me a bit: why would I not want THEM to watch it, but think that it's OK for me to watch it myself? To be perfectly honest, I probably waited so long to see it because I would have been ashamed to select it at Blockbuster and take it to the counter to rent it. What would that have said about me?
Surprisingly, there is not huge amount of violence. More often, we see the aftermath of Henry's handiwork: corpses of women stabbed, raped, strangled, etc.. Even though we do not see the actual killings in many cases, these scenes are still very disturbing for many reasons, among them the fact that the accompanying soundtrack lets us hear the events, the screams, the actual sounds of murder and violence, muffled and distorted and thus made all the more savage. We wonder what it is that makes these killers do the things they do. These guys do not fit in; they are typically not churchgoers, they don't hold steady jobs, they don't play by the rules, they don't have nice wives and children. All of this in itself makes them different from most of us. This can result in a kind of weird fascination, like the compulsion we have to watch the auto wreck or the house fire. Also, we feel glad that it's not us.
The underrated actor Michael Rooker gives a very chilling performance as the title character. We do get a glimpse of why he turned out the way he did when he explains how as a boy he was mistreated by his mother. Other than that, we get no analysis, no explanations, no justifications for his monstrous behavior. He really comes across as more animalistic than human, or actually, more robotic than human; he is hard-wired for death and destruction, torture and pain.  The blonde sister of his murderous acolyte Otis reaches out to him, but he cannot respond in kind; he is too damaged to feel love or compassion for anyone. I've seen pictures of the real Henry and Otis, and they were two of the scariest-looking individuals I've ever seen; you could actually see and feel the presence and influence of Satan in their ravaged faces.
Warning: the videotaped assault on the family, which we see, Blair Witch-style, is one of the few actual ""live"" killings in the movie, and it remains the single most disturbing and horrible sequence I've seen in my entire film-watching life (58 years).
So it all begs the question: why watch a movie like this? I have no answer. We don't really have anything to gain. We would be much better off watching a comedy or life-affirming film, going for a walk, playing with our dog or our kids, praying, doing something good for someone, loving our wives.

heartbreakingly true moments than in a dozen more
pretentious ""straight"" features. Would like to point
out that this is really not a movie about the serial
killer Henry Lee Lucas. Michael Rooker looks nothing
nor acts like the real WEASEL like Lucas. I recommend
1987's CONFESSIONS of a SERIAL KILLER. In that movie
you have a actor playing Henry Lee Lucas that looks like the
135pd Henry. They should have called this movie MICHAEL
or something else. For with the exception of names has
nothing to do with Henry Lee Lucas. BE WARNED! This movie
is 2nd only to Ruggero's cannibal holoCAUST for me on
SCARE factor. The 2nd act HOME INVASION scene being
video taped from Henry I put right there with The
Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw on FRIGHT meter! This is
bar-none one of the most unsettling movies you're
ever going to see,with GRIM atmosphere that clings

Based on the real case of Henry Lee Lucas, Michael Rooker steals the film with a stunning performance in the title role. Given that the film was at least partially made as an exploitation piece, the quality of the acting is much higher than you might expect. As the DVD box says this is the uncut version that we wern't allowed to see when it was first released on video. So the attack on the family is shown in full without the cut-aways back to Henry and Otis watching the video tape they made. This is probably the most disturbing scene in the film and some will find this hard to take, so be warned.

The film is relentlessly violent, downbeat, gritty and just occasionally there is a touch of black comedy. Its very well done, but its not a 'Hollywood' serial killer film!",1190937600,,997,4.383783783783784
981176,5,6305191883,"I first saw this movie about 10 years ago and I remember being impressed with the sheer audacity and outrageousness of it. Now, though ""Henry"" is certainly brutal and bloody, the tone of it is definitely warmer, mellower (decidedly, this may have more to do with me and my current state of mind  as compared with 10 years ago...but be that as it may) and Michael Rooker (as Henry) is not only a vessel of depravity and feral misanthropy, he is also a fully rounded, though warped for sure, human being. In fact Rooker's performance is so thoughtful, his motives for murder so crystal clear that Henry is somehow transformed into a classical tragic hero: we can actually understand him....even empathize with him and this is a major feat on the part of both Rooker and director John Naughton. How do you turn a monster into a living, breathing human being? You write and perform him as if he is those very things. You give him a back-story that could plausibly bring him to unrepentant murder and you plot him on a course that naturally flows out of that back-story: very simple in theory but not often witnessed on the screen.
""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is a masterpiece of condensed, concise, spare and unrepentant mayhem.

Specifically because of the films real nature (almost cinema verite) you cannot dismiss it and it becomes a real chilling possibility.. I have not been quite as freaked out since the first time i saw pasolini's 'salo' a film which depicted fascist sexual and violent opression in a real style.. The camera does not flinch nor does it prepare us with any kind of a traditional warning so common-place in horror movies.. It does not follow a formula it just seems to present us with violence and death in their most real and disturbing forms.. This is what i like about the movie it doesn't gloss over or sugar coat anything it's as if it is saying this is what it is... the reason for such an approach might have been the miniscule 100,000 dollar budget - but the results are far better than nearly every big budget horror or suspense film i have ever seen - indeed it just might be the best horror film since psycho.. The film proves that the simple approach is very often the best.. and it proves that so-called amateur actors are often capable of incredible and emotional performances (if they are directed as expertly as they were here)..

I had never heard of it before, and I figured that I was in for your average, run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick.  Though it is low budget, it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie.  In fact, the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study.

Meet Henry, a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition.  Watch as he goes to work, watch as he hits the bar with his buddy Otis, and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people.  This film does not exploit the violence though; it is very frank and direct, treating it as though Henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park.

This movie is a lot of things, and when it was all over, I just had to sit back and take a few breaths, have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction(s).  I was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing, it is also pretty funny in some parts, though only funny in the blackest sense of the term.  There is no social commentary in this movie, nor does it provide any closure.

As entertaining as these scenes are, you totally understand why the scenes were not included in the final cut.  One of them includes a scene after the one where Otis kills the good samaritan who pulls over to help who he thinks are two stranded motorists.  The director cuts it because he says it came across as too funny, and seeing the scene with the director explaining what is being said IS hilarious!!

Powerful, brutal and unique psychological horror drama thriller with excellent performances by Rooker and the bunch, director Jonathan McNaughton here brings us a dark and disturbing look at the mind of a psychopath on the verge of killing. This film is based on actual life murderer Henry Lee Lucas and it's a thought provoking. gory and flat out terrific motion picture! It's not for the faint of heart for when this movie originally was made in 1986 it was slapped with an ""X"" rating for the subject matter throughout the movie and was held up for 4 years until finally it was released in late 1989 in theaters with no rating but a ""No one under 17 will be admitted"" warning and earned glowing reviews from critics especially Roger Ebert.

This 2-Disc DVD set has quality picture and sound better then before and has good extras like two featurettes, the theatrical trailer with trailers to other Dark Sky Films releases, audio commentary from the director, still gallery, deleted scenes with commentary, and storyboards.

Working with a small budget with Chicago as a canvas, he was able to paint quite a realistically real horror movie. The shortage of funds may have put the movie over in that with higher priced movies more money is used in special effects that often take away substance and acting. Casting was key and McNaughton (to play Henry) choice of another newcomer in Michael Rooker was on target. Rooker's chiseled jaw, coupled with a menacing demeanor brought Henry to life. His nave ways and burning disgust for anything immoral are also great traits Rooker displayed acting as Henry. The supporting cast of Tracy Arnold (Becky) and her brother Otis (played by Tom Towles) round out the newcomer cast which was quite solid. Towles especially does an exceptional job playing the vile Otis. Together Henry and Otis are an effective and heinous tag-team that indulge on their victims with a cold and savage manner. The family killing caught on film is as disturbing a scene I have ever seen.

Beyond the gore and brutal visuals, the movie does have a touch realistic humor. Otis especially brings out some of this often perverted humor.

981469,4,6305191883,"This low budget 80's film has become a classic for the genre and a focus of study for student filmmakers in its use of video to capture a realistic edge for the audience.

John McNaughton co-wrote the script, produced and directed the film, focusing on the protagonist, Henry, a composite of several real-life serial killers.

Henry (Michael Rooker) kills because he feels he has to, enjoying his work to the point where he has thought the process through, never murdering in the same method as the last killing. As he explains to Otis, (Tom Towles) the police are trained to find a modus operandi; therefore you never kill the same kind of person nor murder them in the same way. There is randomness in this madness, and one must continue moving on, never killing in the same place, thus confusing the authorities.

Not surprisingly, there is really no plot to this film, as its subject is random murder.  Henry shares an apartment with Otis, an ex con on parole working in a gas station and supplementing his income selling drugs. Otis' sister comes to live with them, running from her abusive husband. As the woman has been sexually abused since childhood, she is told that Henry has too, and they make a connection. It is here we see two sides to Henry's personality, a ruthless, conscienceless killer and a somewhat caring and thoughtful individual. Rooker portrays the psychopath extremely well, as his eyes express a vacant, emotionless stare in every scene. As most psychopaths are, he is impulsive, deceitful and highly manipulative. After a macabre murder of two prostitutes, a casual killing Otis and Henry perform when they go out for a few drinks, Otis gets the taste for murder and joins Henry on future killing sprees.

What put this film on the map is the scene where Otis and Henry video one of their killings. They break into a suburban house and torture the couple, killing the son when he unexpectedly walks in, stabbing the father and breaking the wife's neck. The slightly out of focus and grainy quality to the video and the performance itself, conveys a frightening realism to this scene. When the video ends, the camera pans to Otis and Henry sitting on the couch watching the murders on the television, mesmerized, expressions of objective fascination, an eerie detachment, as if they are watching a movie about someone else This film technique was relatively new, ensuring ""Henry"" would become the subject for future filmmakers.

The film was released in 1986, thus this 20th anniversary edition of the picture. There is no doubt that ""Henry"" is one of the most frightening films ever released. It set a precedent for most future films in this particular genre as well as other genres, ensuring its place in moviemaking history.",1140220800,17,2755,4.851063829787234
981470,5,6305191883,"John McNaughton's directorial debut has been hailed as one of the best by any first-time director. I won't be one to disagree with those who agree. McNaughton took $125,000 dollars, an idea of fictionalizing a week in the life of one real-life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, and a dedicated crew of filmmakers to create a raw, unflinching, visceral piece of filmmaking. Originally filmed and finished in 1986, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer languished in ratings limbo as the filmmakers struggled with the MPAA over its X-rating. In fact, it's been reported and written in many publications that it is one of the few films screened by the MPAA where they saw no way an edit here or there can ever lower it to an R-rating. I think its fortunate for film fans and academics everywhere that McNaughton and company decided to release the film in 1990 unrated.

Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer was loosely-based on the life of one Henry Lee Lucas. One of the most prolific (though Lucas has since discounted ever killing over 600 people) serial killers in American history. From the beginning, Henry plunges the audience into a world seen through the eyes of a sociopath and as, Ebert once wrote in his own review: ""an unforgettable portrait of the pathology of a man for whom killing is not a crime but simply a way of passing time and relieving boredom.""

The first scene is haunting in its graphic and realistic portrayal of the randomness of a serial killer's passing through the myriad roads and highways that criss-cross the American landscape. It was this stark and realistic portrayal of the aftermath of violence and death that has made some people label McNaughton's directorial debut as a snuff-film masquerading as an arthouse production. It's difficult to disagree with such people since the violence (though it doesn't go as far as most horror films of the era and barely a blip on the MPAA's radar in today's mega-blockbuster-shoot'em-ups) has no look of articiality and not glossed-over with your typical horror/suspense sensibilities. It doesn't have that exploitation look that the horror films of the 70's and early 80's. What it did have was the look and feel of a documentary. The titular character (chillingly portrayed by Michael Rooker) commits his murders as one who sees nothing wrong in what they're doing. To Henry what he does he does to pass the time and to break-up the boredom of his existence. This behavior shows the banality of Henry's view of the world around him. It goes to show that as horrific as Henry must seem to the audience there's a sense of reality in what he does. We read about it on the news, in true-crime documentaries, and in the sensationalist shows dealing with serial and mass murderers.

But Henry is not the only one who wades into the dark underbelly of American life and society. There's Henry's former cellmate, Otis (played with relish by Tom Towles) who at first seems like a buffoon, but later shows his own pathology for senseless killings as Henry finally brings him into his own world. In fact, Otis' reaction to Henry's revelations about what he does in secret looks similar to the reaction of the violence addicted mass audience who revel in the violence in action films and horror retreads. Otis is at first confused and knows that he should be disgusted with the killings he first witness Henry committing, but he later gives in to his own primal impulses. He soon revels in the act of murder and even sees it as his own form of entertainment. It's during the home-invasion and subsequent murders of the home's family captured on videotape by Henry and Otis that this change in Otis hits home.

This is the juncture in the film that posits the damning question the filmmakers want to ask the audience. Do we recoil in horror and disgust at this horrifying, voyeuristic sequence or does the audience continue to watch with the dispassionate eyes of one who has become desensitized to onscreen violence. There's no clear answer to this question and the filmmakers don't condescend to the audience and try to sugar-coat the violence. It is also this sequence where we see the difference between Henry and Otis. Henry almost feels remote and disconnected from the acts he's committing. To him breaking the neck of a teenage boy might be the same as stepping on an ant. But to Otis the killings themselves becomes his addiction and only form of joy. He's willing to go beyond what his mentor has done to sate his appetites. We see Henry's reaction to this change in Otis and realize that as much as the audience want to hate Henry, he is the lesser of two evils. He doesn't take joy from his work and we cling to that barely there shred of decency in the hope that salvation and redemption is at the end of the ride.

To the filmmakers' credit Henry doesn't trivialize the gruesome events from scene one right up to the end credits by tacking on a Hollywoodize happy ending. As the final reel comes to a conclusion and we see Henry and Otis' sister, Becky driving off into the night (a sort of reverse-negative of the typical riding-off into the sunset of Hollywood past), the audience is ready to breath a sigh of relief from the relentless visual and emotional pounding the film has put on the audience. But the rug is pulled out from under the audience's feet. McNaughton and his writers do not believe in the redemption of Henry. In fact, they know that such things are only seen in Hollywood and fairytales. What they give the audience instead is a scene that continue to show that the film is steeped in the real world. People like Henry do not find forgiveness and salvation from their evil deeds. People like Henry continue to ply the roads and highways of America. Their seeming normalcy hiding the calculating, sociopathic murderous instincts just below the surface.

I credit Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer as one of the truest work of American filmmaking. A great character study of a sociopathic individual whose banality can truly be called the face of evil. McNaughton's film is admired and reviled and both sides have credible points in taking their sides. It is a great piece of work that shows that filmmaking can go beyond its basic need to entertain. It is also a brutal piece of film that didn't have to be made the way it was made, but to do it in any other way would've diluted the message and impact of the story. 10/10",1138492800,25,6415,4.707925200356189
981471,5,6305191883,"Before discussing the film per se, I must say that I wish this movie had been called ""John: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" because I am tired of reading about it not being an accurate representation of Henry Lee Lucas' life.  Repeat after me: it is not a biography...it is not a biography.  With that said, this is not a typical serial killer movie.  There are no forensic psychologists and there's no cliched detective fighting his personal demons.  This movie captures several episodes in the life of Henry, which is rather banal outside of the murders.  Nothing begins or ends in this film, the characters aren't changed by its conclusion, even if most of them are dead.  Basically, Henry does odd jobs in Chicago and occasionally commits brutal murders.  He draws his dimwitted, drug-dealing housemate, Otis, into his exploits and enters an intimate relationship with Otis' sister.  As you can see, the plot is simple, but effective.  The film is shot in a grainy, bleak fashion that is more like a documentary than a big-budget film.  The acting is more than adequate; the titular character is especially well-played.  Beware that no punches are pulled and nothing is added to lighten the mood(except, perhaps, the line about the Bears, which had me in stitches).  In actuality, this movie is not very gory; it just seems that way.  My one bone to pick is with the distracting music, which detracts from the matter of fact direction and pacing.

981473,5,6305191883,"Every year, hundreds of thousands of Americans disappear.

Just up and go missing. Vanished. Into thin air, it would appear: gone, without a trace. Spooky.

Or not: some of then stash their loot away in the Turks or Caicos, flee the United States with their trinkets and pilfered greenbacks, change their names, change their faces, spend the rest of their happy sunlit well-tanned lives chasing nubile little thong-wearing creatures south of the Equator, where the climate's sultry and there's plenty of adultery, as Byron might have put it.

Some are not so well-heeled: they just run away, sing lonely songs of despair and love gone wrong in honkey-tonks and juke joints. Some waitress. Some go to Hollywood, become writers, singers, whores and scalliwags and confidence men (and women!) and grifters.

And then there are the Others: the vast legion of the Missing, the litany of names read off milk cartons and sifted along on postcards sighing like the silt of some vanished seabed, ""Have you Seen Me"" their plaintive, quiet lament.

Some of them run into Monsters along the way. Some of them encounter creatures like Henry, the night-gaunt lunatic and quietly determined psychopath who is the subject of director John McNaughton's 3000-volts-to-the-nuts flick ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"".

It's a portrait drawn from life, incidentally: this sick, twisted little sliver of grue is taken from the life of notorious serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, a real American master of the mordant craft, who claimed---before recanting everything---of having been involved in more than 350 murders, and who, according to investigators, may have slaughtered more than 3,000, proving that all work and no play makes Jack a very dull boy.

Anyhoo, ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is a classic, and it deserves its reputation as a real ice-pick to the cranium, even to the most jaded gorehound out there. Filmed on a budget capable of buying a six-pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon and a pack of smokes, John McNaughton gets right in there and shows us a few days in the life---warts, corpses, and all---of a good old all-American murdering nutjob.

It's a sere, bleak, brutal movie, and its simplicity---Henry (Michael Rooker, who turns the noise level wayyyyy down on the acting and comes off as a little too convincing) drifting through and then obliterating the banal lives of loud desperation of his buddy Otis (Tom Towles, who revels in a twisted, carniverous role as a sort of real-life Gollum) and Otis's sister Becky (Tracy Arnold, who does a fine job and looks perfectly chewed up by her working-class world).

You know why Henry packs such a punch, with its grainy, washed-out colors, its seedy back-alley setting, its slack-jawed, laconic murderer/hero?

It feels real.

Because there is not a second when you doubt its reality, its red-handed sincerity. Henry, scoping out prey in a mall parking lot, eyes darting from one hopeful to the next. Henry, showing Otis how to plug a dude a few blocks off Chicago's mag mile. Otis, all faded blue-collar damnation and pressure-cooker twisted sexuality, grinning those blighted choppers as he finally finds something in life he has a little talent for: cruelty. Oh yeah, and murder.

""Henry"" is as large and life and twice as ugly, and just as bleak and real as the unemployment office on a Monday in December.

The new release is stacked, baby: the full-screen remastered treatment looks and sounds as good as this beer-budget cheapo is every gonna get, and frankly---when grimy and doomed look this good, why mess with perfection? And you've got a director's commentary, a documentary on Henry Lee Lucas, and lots of other goodies.

But with that in mind, the real gem is the flick: Henry, bug exterminator, people exterminator, street cleaner, sicko, straightforward kinda guy. The natural inclination is to ask: Why?

The only answer---at least from the Monster---is ""because I can.""

They even interview that daring woman from the home invasion scene. The Henry Lee Lucas true crime documentary was just as good. They even interview the real Henry in prison(this footage was recorded before his death in 2001). They talk about his childhood, crimes, and what motivated him...Very evil man. This lil extra belongs on the disc. Plus outtakes that show some scenes that didn't belong including more victims and a scene between Henry and Ottis I don't even want to get into...yikes. But yeah guys, if you like this movie this is the definitive version, cause the transfer is beautiful and the extras rewarding.

981655,3,6305191883,"Well if you have seen any of my prevous reviews then you know that i have been watching some of the most ""disturbing, shocking and scary"" films ever made these past few weeks and so i was excited when my copy of Henry finally arrived.  Out of all of the serial killer/slasher movies i have seen lately Henry was hyped the most and perhaps that is the main reason for my dissapointment with the film.  Michael Rooker was great but i cant say that at any point in the movie i felt disturbed or uncomfortable in the least.  (spoilers)  If theres one thing i have learned from reading everyones reviews lately about these types of movies its that all it takes to offend people is a rape scene and all it takes to horrify people is a poke in the eye.  I cant tell you how many rapes and popped eyes i have seen this past week but its more than i care to admit.  I don't know who was the first to do it and i don't care but anyone who still thinks these tricks are the true elements or terror needs to see more films because after youve seen it done in 10+ movies it looses any impact it might have had.  Now don't get me wrong, Henry also delivered on the incest and the child killing (teenager really) but all in all i thought this movie was just another carbon copy of the same old tricks used time and time again in these types of movies.  The only saving grace for me in this movie was the performance by Michael Rooker.  He was very convincing in the part but none of the other actors were very good at all.  Also, the quality of the dvd sucks.  There are many points where the sound doesnt match the picture and it feels like your watching a cheap import dub, the words loose their meaning when they don't match the actors facial expresions or emotions.  I would have given this movie more credit had it not cheaped out at the end too.  First off the ending isn't true to the real Henry story but i could forgive that if the director had made it more sensational than the truth but he did not.  I guess we are supposed to be scared because HENRY IS STILL OUT THERE but i felt there could have been several points in the movie where we could have gone one direction but instead traveled down the same old serial killer road.  oh well, MUCH better than ""the last house on the left"" but not nearly as good a movie as ""man bites dog"".  Not the same type of movie but some movies have something new to offer while others just want to use the old tried and tested methods of blah blah...",1118275200,,2482,4.171907756813417
981656,4,6305191883,"This is a grimy realistic account of one serial killer's exploits. Michael Rooker plays the title role as an outwardly sane and shy type, living with an ex-cellmate and who happens to be, a serial killer. Henry is a thrill killer, he will kill when the mood takes him. Rooker plays the title role superbly, he really injects a frightening bluntness into the role. Henry is portrayed as almost inanimate, a perversion of stoicism... we haven't a clue about his motives or what emotions stir inside him driving him to commit murder. During the film his flatmates' sister shows up and joins them in the flat, she takes a shine on Henry and the relationship between them seems almost 'normal'. When Otis (his flatmate) tries it on with his own sister, Henry stops him telling him to stop, that he shouldnt be doing this with his sister, this injection of moral dissaproval from a truly amoral predator sets the tone. In this movie nothing is as it seems and we wish the innocent girl would just get the hell out of there!

Henry and Otis then go out for a beer and Henry introduces the leering Otis to the joys of murder, they snap the necks of two prostitutes, now Otis joins the game. Several murders later and we know there is a reckoning coming between the three flatmates. Truly enough it happens when Henry interrupts Otis raping his sister, after Otis is dispatched the two go away together but does this mean our hero is going to settle down for a normal life for once!? Of course not, the inevitable when it happens is described by the director just as dispassionately as he describes all the other murders. It is this grimy, casual vulgarity which is the films strength and it's weakness. Truly as art it is a very convincing take on serial killing but it leaves you feeling hollow and a little depressed at the sheer banality and pointlessness of the murders. It would be easier to accept he does it for some compelling reason, at least then it would give those deaths some meaning, however difficult to justify.

Otis' sister doesnt really have as many important scenes in the movie however in one way she is vital, she as a means by which Henry can show us just how despicably evil he is. When we meet her, we learn of her as a person she has a child she is hoping to raise somewere decent, she has just split up with her lover. She is unaware of the murders, she is someone we can empathise with, feel for. It is important that we know that Henry gets to know her as we do but Henry being what he is is unable to empathise with her as we can. Through her the viewer is made aware of the effects of murder, the killing of a sweet innocent girl is guaranteed to educate us to the horrible truths of murder. The mere image of naked silent corpses is not. Otis himself is good as the depraved ex-con, unlike Henry when he starts killing he takes his murders passionately and is perhaps more sadistic with his victims as a result, he is a warning to the viewer about human nature, anyone is capable of becoming unspeakably evil, given opportunity and desire. His degeneration is also charted by his sister, from the meeting at the airport when he comes across as concerned for her,  to the new murdering Otis who violates her.",1114214400,,3231,4.4636209813874785

981658,4,6305191883,"Personally, I don't find this film to be nearly as disturbing as lots of other viewers, but it's definitely a disquieting film, It also earns points for being different and for doing what it does remarkably well, particularly considering how little budget they had.

There isn't that much I can say about this movie, really.  It just follows the life and exploits of a serial killer, Henry, and his accomplice, Otis.  They pretty much just kill, and sit around their apartment.  There ain't a whole lot more to it.  The performances are all strong, and Rooker's much praised performance as Henry is worthy of it's reputation.  I find the different interpretations of his character interesting, as some think he seems like an ordinary guy who has strange impulses he can't control.  Though there's an argument for this position, I take the opposite, and I found him to be chillingly and utterly inhuman.  He doesn't seem conflicted at all, and his apparent normalcy and humanity at certain points in the film seem to be nothing but an act.  Not an act to deceive people, even, he just seems to be a void, reflecting those around him only because that's just what you do.  He acts human because that's how others act, but seems to lack to underlying motivations. Why he kills is a mystery as well.  He just does it.  Otis is a bit more conventionally human, at least in a number of ways.  Initially he seems like a joker, not a smart man or a terribly nice man, but not really fundamentally evil either.  He's particularly creepy as this side of him remains, and is assimilated into his new personality as, through the film, he is revealed as a [...] and sadist who quickly takes to Henry's grisly trade.  The only other character of significance is Becky, Otis's  sister who is apparently attracted to Henry(aware that he has murdered before, but not aware that he's a serial killer) and subject to advances from Otis.  She doesn't do that much in particular, just provides for conflict.

The biggest problem in the film is the music.  Occasionally it gets too loud and cheesy and detracts from the intensity of the film substantially.  Most of the time it's alright, but when it's bad it's really noticeable.  This problem is most notable during the murder of the stolen media vender.  I think it would be interesting to see the film virtually without music, perhaps never with anything more than the electric hum  used sometimes while surveying the victims. The films also has a tiny bit of unintentional humor, specifically at a few points where Henry is explaining the trade to Otis.  This is because describing horrific scenes and deeds in such a dispassionate manner is often used in black comedies, and I couldn't help but make the connection.  Still, this is only a tiny problem, and I don't think you can really blame the film makers for it.

 Since they had no budget, the gore is not remarkable, but they do it professionally enough that it doesn't detract from the film.  They wisely decided to keep it to a minimum, as overdoing it with their budget would've been sure to have extremely fake results. Besides, the horror in this film isn't dependent on the grossout, and it probably wouldn't have been very appropriate.  Pretty much the whole film has an unpleasant air to it, but the infamous home invasion tape that Otis and Henry make is truly horrific, and definitely one of the most chilling scenes I've ever seen.  Not gory, but definitely horrifying.  It easily puts the rest of the film to shame, but if the rest of the film had been that unpleasant it would've been unwatchable.

Reviews of disturbing films are usually pretty pointless, as what effects you is extremely personal, and it's pretty tough to gauge what will effect someone else.  Still, anyone interested in horror should see this, as well as anyone looking for a contrast to the slick, stylisitically dark serial killer films of the mainstream.(Not to say that those films are completely w/o value, but this is a total different game)

And, in response to complaints that this film is 'totally fake' and that Lucas couldn't have commited these crimes I say, well, no one is claiming this is a docudrama.  Maybe the filmakers claimed it was initially, and this is a crass, inappropriate marketing plot if they did, but this doesn't really effect the film.  The film is what it is, regardless of whether or not it has a specific, direct connection with reality.  And as far the suggestion that this film is somehow sullying Lucas's goodname, and is worthy of a lawsuit, I say that he is in fact a killer, if not necessarily one as the film portrays him, and that anyone who decides to confess to hundreds of murders he didn't actually commit has no right to complain when people suggest that he's a serial killer.(Though I wouldn't know if he's complained personally, just that others have complained for him)  In fact, the movie is easier on Lucas in someways, as it DOES mention how cruel and perverse his mother was, and that her murder was actually provoked by an attack from her,(replacing a broom with a whiskey bottle) yet fails to mention that she was 74 years old at the time, and thus perhaps not the greatest threat, and that Lucas was actually an adult, rather than 14 years old, as the film suggests.  But yeah, in case anyone out there is actually confused this film is definitely not closely based on the real life of Henry Lee Lucas.",1101859200,4,5433,4.696937697993664

981823,4,6305191883,"Body after body is depicted together with murdering agonizing screams as a background sound.  This is the beginning of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, which instills a nightmarish vision of the mind of a serial killer.  The film is loosely based on Henry Lee Lucas who was emotionally, physically, and sexually abused as child by his mother while living with his handicapped father who had lost his legs in an train accident.  Henry had been forced to wear dresses and watch his mother having sex with strangers, which has created internal enraged emotions toward women.  In addition, Henry shows an emotional numbness whenever he has killed someone as if he had just finished the last of his coffee.
The story takes place in the Chicago area where Henry lives with Otis and Becky.  Otis spent time in jail with Henry where the two became friends.  His sister Becky has recently escaped an abusive relationship while Henry goes about trying to find odd jobs and killing women in random ways as it will not leave a trail back to him.  However, when living in close quarters with others it is does not take long before Otis finds out about Henry's secret, but instead of going to the police they partner up.  Henry teaches him the secret of killing for pleasure and together they begin to find ways of sharing these grotesque moments with each other.
Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has some interesting cinematic moments where a camera is use for the main point-of-view, which later is transferred into the living room.  This brings a morbidly surreal experience to the audience as the fetish of the disturbed characters is brought to the eyes of the audience in a revolting manner.  Yet, it is a subtle transition, which most people have experienced through their own home video moments.  The story is filmed with highly grained film stock, which enhances the realistic acuity of the environment as it brings further horror to the minds of the audience.  Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is a highly disturbing film that experiments with audience participation in the film in a most clever way, which leaves the audience with a truly horrific cinematic experience.",1089417600,,2173,4.8432432432432435
981824,5,6305191883,"The reputation of John McNaughton's ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is enormous in the realm of independent cinema. Made on a budget of over one hundred thousand dollars back in the 1980s, the movie went on to polarize viewers and critics alike. Some praised McNaughton's unflinching vision, his nihilistic portrayal of two lower class killers with nothing to live for and nothing to lose. The other camp rejected the film outright, deriding it as the worst sort of exploitative trash cinema. I tend to favor the former opinion; I think McNaughton's film is a brilliant look at a microscopic segment of society we all know exists even if it is rarely discussed. Besides, bashing the film as exploitative beggars the question of who it is exploiting. Serial killers? Guys like Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Henry Lee Lucas (the killer McNaughton loosely based the film on) could stand to have a bit more mud slung on their already malevolent reputations. I cannot find one scene in the movie that idolizes what these two guys do in their spare time. And, unlike slasher films and sundry other horror films, ""Henry"" demonstrates that violent acts have serious consequences.
""Henry"" takes place in the dirty, gray streets and alleyways of Chicago. Henry (Michael Rooker) and his prison pal Otis (Tom Towles) spend their days working low paying jobs, drinking beer, and watching television. Otis toils at a gas station in between trips to his parole officer. Henry works as an insect exterminator (!). Things start looking up when Becky (Tracy Arnold), Otis's sister, moves in with the pair to escape the doldrums of small town life. Although she has some problems back home with a troublesome boyfriend, Becky takes a shine to Henry almost immediately. She pesters her brother for information about the man and is not disturbed in the least when Otis tells her that Henry went to prison for murdering his mother. In fact, she finds this information rather intriguing. Henry comes to like Becky too, so much so that he steps in when Otis treats her in a disturbing manner. The presence of Becky complicates the odd relationship between the two men, a relationship that is soon to take a horrific turn as Otis discovers what Henry does in his spare time.
Henry is a serial killer, a despicable murderer who preys on total strangers. He thinks nothing of following a potential victim home from the mall, or picking up strangers in bars and then dispatching them in grisly ways. Henry likes the feeling he gets from his crimes, and he soon involves Otis in his gruesome activities. Why his friend decides to help is a mystery. Perhaps he feels Becky driving a wedge between him and Henry. Otis exhibits many of the behaviors associated with a follower, and Henry is definitely a take-charge sort of guy, so maybe that is the overriding reason. Whatever the case, Otis soon becomes as enthusiastic about murder as Henry. When Otis complains about being angry one evening, his pal helpfully relieves the tension by tricking a passing car into stopping so the two can shoot the driver. A broken television set provides the impetus for a killing at a fence's office. The absolute worst crime involving these two, however, is something we see on videotape as Henry and Otis relive their thrills. Predictably, Becky soon discovers what her brother and his friend do when they aren't at home. The conclusion to the film is a shocker.
Any way you cut it (no pun intended), ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is an excruciating experience. The crimes, while not overtly gory, revel in the sheer sadism of the act. If McNaughton was attempting to evoke a sense of outrage on the part of the audience, he succeeded wildly. You cannot even stand to look at these people after awhile, so repulsive are their actions. I found myself praying for a police officer, a security guard, a neighborhood watch guy-anybody in authority to show up and put a stop to these two goons' activities. But as evil in real life often goes unchecked, so do Henry's and Otis's extracurricular activities in Chicago. The film accomplishes what it sets out to do largely because the performances of the two actors playing the principal characters do such a good job. ""Henry"" was Michael Rooker's first film, and I agree with McNaughton when he says in the interview on the disc that this actor had star written all over him. Rooker plays Henry as a sort of withdrawn, soft-spoken type that probably would appear unthreatening to potential victims. Just as good is Tom Towles as the grubby Otis, who portrays his character as an insufferable extrovert who occasionally sinks into pouty silences. Without these two actors, one wonders whether ""Henry"" would have become the cult classic it is today.
The DVD version of the film is a good one. A lengthy interview with John McNaughton tells the viewer everything they ever wanted to know about the movie. The director explains the long road to finishing the project, his experiences when it finally opened in a theater, and the lengthy battle with the MPAA over the rating for the movie, a battle which saw the censors pushing for extensive cuts to avoid the dreaded 'X' rating while McNaughton fought to keep his vision intact. Considering some of the extreme films floating around out there today, the concerns of the censors seem rather archaic now. Still, the film has lost little of its power to disturb deeply. Fans of offbeat cinema, if they have not done so already, will wish to pick this one up soon.",1087344000,41,5521,4.83104540654699

This movie begins and ends with the suberb acting of Michael Rooker, the main character ""Henry""... he does an absolute amazing job of depicting the heartlessness of many of these killers. Everything you hear associated with a killer is touched in this film. With most killers you'll hear about no sense of remorse for their victims and that is exactly the personality of the main character. One quote that I won't forget is towards the end when Henry says, ""I guess I love you too,"" in reply to Otis' sisters ""I love you Henry.""

981826,5,6305191883,"Well, a certain ""viewer"" from Seattle seems to think this is a message board, and has decided to single me out for his flaming.  Okay...fine.  I have no problem with that.  To address his/her/its points:
Movies don't scare me because they aren't frightening.  Yes, I can suspend disbelief and immerse myself in the manufactured reality of a film, if the film is good enough.  But how am I really supposed to get immersed in the faux reality of movies that don't even pretend to take place in reality?  Movies like the Friday the 13th series are self-parody.  So are most other horror movies...even if the film-makers don't intend it, the movies still become unintentional self-parodies.  There are a few horror movies that manage to escape that stigma.  TCM is one of those rare films...The Exorcist is another...Blair Witch was a more recent example.  But none of those movies scared me, either...or disturbed me, for that matter.
Henry, on the other hand, disturbed me because it's very close to reality.  The cinematic style is minimalist and very naturalistic, as are all of the performances.  The dialogue never lapses from conversational into that awful realm of stiffness.  There is no central plot...no interconnected series of events that all mount to some inevitable denouement.  Essentially, it's just a bunch of things that happened...kind of like real life.
And the subject matter is closer to real life than just about any horror movie you can name.  You want to talk about The Exorcist?  Find the number of documented cases of so-called demon possession in America in the past 25 years.  Then compare it to the number of serial murder cases in America in the past 25 years.  If you're walking alone in the city at night...deserted streets...no chance of rescue should something happen...do you think that you're more likely to become the victim of a serial killer, or of demonic possession?  I think we both know the answer...and whatever is most likely to happen to you is, by its nature, scarier.
It's okay if you don't like the movie.  Some people don't get it and they never will.  I understand that...and I really don't care.

THAT EVERY ONE RECOMENDS I SEE CAUSE ITS THE SCARIEST MOST DISTURBING FILM EVER MADE!  Give me a breake.  The only part I found explicit was the part were they are taping otis raping the young mother and the child walks in and gets a beating.
I don't get it.  THERE IS NO PLOT.  Just a guy killing people that he comes across.  I kept hearing how the ending was so brilliant and stuff and it wasn't as I expected to be.
I cant believe this movie got an UNrated rate.  It wasn't that
bad.  If you wanna see worse violent films go see Freddy vs jason and see what gore is or go see other old school horror films cause I still don't get what was so disturbing and scary about the film.  The part were otis is getting pumled to death and stabbed in the eye was funny for me cause it was so damn cheesy.
I don't mean to be so mean about this film but c'mon!
THIS IS THE FILM EVERY ONE IS SAYING IS THE MOST DISTURBING FILM EVER MADE!  Go see Red to kill and youll know disturbing.
Are you sure HENRY is the movie that is being viewed as the scariest film ever made?
HENRY:The sick mind of a man who go's around randomly killing
random people.  The same movie were you see Otis raping a woman and henry killing the son by snapping his neck.  YEAH RIGHT.
I cant believe this is the film.  I give it credit cause the actors were all right.  I liked the character developement
but all over all its an average movie.
I thought the begining was gonna be extreamly scary but noooo all you see is lame cheezy bodies.
Over all its an average ok movie for me but If you wanna try it out go ahead and you might like it....and you might not.
I cant believe this was an X rated film.  I thought passion of the crist should have bin NC-17 but it was for moral reasons I think.
OVER ALL Give this movie a try if you want but for me its just a rental....",1079654400,,1894,3.989389920424403
981828,5,6305191883,"Yes...this is another movie review by PR...but please don't delete and move on until you've read this.

I just finished watching a film I never knew existed until my demented camera film processor guy once again suggested I see a film that would knock my socks off.

He's done it again!

This one, entitled ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"", makes ""Natural Born Killers"" look like a baby.  This thriller has it all...and the title tells all.

Hannibal Lechter was frightening and sometimes unreal...HENRY IS REAL!!!!!  AND SO FRIGHTENING you may not survive the first 5 minutes.  If you do, then fasten those seat belts and get ready for one of the most chilling crime thrillers you have ever seen.

And figure this.  Most chillers, thrillers and killers involve the cops.  Not once during this 2-hour film do you see a cop trying to find this maniac.  This is, definitely, a ""portrait"" of a maniacal killer...and there are scenes that are so real, you may wanna add an extra bolt to your door, look more often into your rear view mirror, and never see another chiller again.

Henry is portrayed by little known Michael Rooker.  He is the spitten image of Woody Harrelson in ""Natural Born Killers"", but much more believable.  This guy is totally in tune with being insane...and he's great in this insane role.

Then  there's Tom Towles as ""Otis"", just as deranged, and even more so a total pervert.  He is the brother of love interest ""Becky"", played by Tracy Arnold.

This one is a solid ""10"" for crime buffs.  If you loved ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Natural Born Killers"", ya gotta see ""Henry"".

Each of you needs to have a buddy like I have at the local camera shop.  This guy is even more deranged than me.  He loves the same flicks that I do...and he has been an invaluable resource.

In the crime thriller...deranged serial killer...totally insane murder flick genre', ""Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is a top notch TEN....10...10...10.  Don't miss this one!",1074902400,6,1974,4.718475073313783

981830,1,6305191883,"What a waste of my $1.99!  I went to blockbuster to rent this flick, hoping that it would fill my horror expectations.  After watching it, I am in complete shock that this film has received so many recommendations from horror movie fans, I'm not longer going to rely on online reviews to help me decide which movies to watch.  Firstly, it's not even biographical.  The real Henry met Otis in a Florida soup kitchen where they both worked...among other things.
I don't really mind the inaccuracy of the film as long as the film itself is unique and presents a solid story.  Actually, I did not expect the film to be in-line with the real Henry, based on what I've read about the flick.  The movie itself contains no originality, nothing innovative.  It's like watching a bland 80's home video of Homeless looking people.  This film could have been made by anyone.  The writing is poor, the acting is moderate on a B movie level, and the general meaning of it is unoriginal.  Some of the things that people like about this film are so easy to think of, the backdrops of Chicago's slum filled streets for example.
The only reason the makers of the film named the movie ""Henry"" and used other elements that are similar to the real life Henry lee lucas and Co., is to sell a few more copies of the film.  Without the Henry Lucas connection(if you can even find much of a connection aside from the names of the characters)no one would even be talking about this flick.",1070323200,,1462,4.5
981831,5,6305191883,"When asking people what truly inspires them to be afraid, droves of answers can be counted.
Some will recount tales that they've heard within their childhood, noting how terrifying they were. They'll weave stories of monsters lurking within the shadows, of beasts going bump in the night, and of the weird things they've reflected on since they were children hiding neck deep beneath a garden of covers. Yes, many thing Lovecraftian, all with tentacles and teeth, preaching ordeals reaching well beyond the bizarre.
Others will tell of the things within nature that have made them afraid. They'll cite the fear they've been given that makes them stay out of the water or out of the jungle, that keeps them away from insects of sharks, and that makes them leery of the other manifestations that nature can bestow. They say that this is because of what they can do, knowing that these beasts are predators and are accordingly worth fearing.
A minority of people see something within that statement that others do not comprehend, however, noting how some portions of nature are darker than others. Some cannot be avoided simply by staying indoors and can blend in with the normality of terrain, walking the streets of our cities and living in the homes so close to our own. These are everyday terrors and not those that blindside those unfortunate enough to be frowned on by the stars themselves. No, these beast look like you or I do, only those beasts are something all-too-terrifyingly different.
Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is a story about just such a beast, living and making his way almost invisibly and existing just below the social radar. He earns money by doing small jobs, killing insects of all things, and he shares an abode with his not-so-bright roommate, Otis. He seems like a normal guy, too, with a quiet manner, a tendency to smoke Kools, and a smile that seems disarming. In ""reality,"" however, that couldn't be farther from the truth. In his spare time, Henry likes to pick up hitchhikers, to assail prostitutes and waitresses, and to visit ""Mom and Pop"" stores with one purpose. He likes to kill people. And he likes to do so in more-than-realistically horrific ways.
While this movie is touted as barbaric by some and pointless by others, this is a reflection of the truth within our world. It shows a side we oftentimes want to forget, thinking that terror keeps to the shadows and can't move into our neighborhoods under our very noises. Through an array of well-done performances, this low-budget movie worms its way into a person and leave a chilling calling card. And while graphic and not intended for those not wanting some thick with blood and random violence, it is one of the more frightening things I've seen in some time. And that's especially true in its ""uncut"" showing that is now available.",1069200000,4,2834,4.82135523613963
981974,4,6305191883,"""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is, not only because of its realism or its interesting main character, a very good movie.
With this movie, I discovered an actor that never really attracted me, maybe because of SOME of his more recent projects: Michael Rooker. I know, he played in ""Replicant"" with Jean-Claude Van Damme, but except for that, I was pretty impressed by his filmography. Mr. Rooker is far away from being a bad actor, really. And this film, along with other productions, proves it. It was his first film, and definitely a great role to start. Many actors started their path through glory with a bad guy role. But Henry is more than a simple bad guy...
The film, in 1986, had brought a strong wave of controversy. I have to admit that it's pretty violent (not SO much, but I can understand why it was censored in the 80's). I saw a 81 minute version, which is not the whole runtime, and sometimes it was obvious that some murders had been cut. But too bad, it's true to say that the sadism and brutality of the violence brings something really intense and somehow disgusting in the film, but even with the 81 minutes version I felt its effect completely. (SPOILERS) Many murders are atrocious to see because of the graphic aspect, others are gratuitous, and others are disgustingly brutal. The graphic aspect makes it a sometimes pretty gory film, like the guy that gets his head smashed with a TV, or the guy that is stabbed in the eye and then gets his head cut off. These murders bring a sense of strong disgust to the viewer. The gratuitous murders, like when Henry gives a gun to Otis and tells him to kill anyone to see how it feels to kill someone, are probably the ones that show how sick Henry (and Otis) are. The brutal ones, without pretending that they are not ALL brutal, are the worse to watch. If you've seen Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"", you'll understand. There is a very disturbing rape scene in ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"". But it's not only the rape that is SO disturbing, it's also the fact that they are filming everything, and Otis just can't stop watching it later. Those who found ""Deliverance""'s rape scene shocking, don't see this, really, because ""Deliverance""'s scene was very soft and had NOTHING brutal compared to ""Henry""'s.
But, the most important point, the realism. The setting is very common. Henry, Otis and his sister live in a very small house, have very normal jobs, are not wearing some Versace clothes, and are simply looking like anybody you could meet on the street. There's a scene where Henry cleans the floor with a broom, you know, all these things you have to do in every day life, but that are never shown in movies. Movies usually show the extremes: either very rich people or poor people. But the middle-class environment is so well delivered. But we still have to understand that this is a low budget film, so even if they had wanted to make a richer environment, I doubt they could have done so. But believe me, it's a very good element of the film. The characters are also very affected (in a good way) by a near setting. The way the speak, their accent, vocabular, their jobs, their clothes, everything.
It appears that the character of Henry is an interpretation of the not THAT renowned killer Henry Lee Lucas. It's an interesting concept to make a movie about a killer that is not known as THE MOST DANGEROUS killer off all times. They could have made a movie about Charles Manson's life, but they decided to make it on someone a little less known's life. And that's good. It's like the film ""Sweet and Lowdown"", with Sean Penn, who plays the SECOND best guitarist of all times. It's good to see that they give second places a chance.
The characters are not so important, except for Otis and of course, Henry. Henry plays some kind of teacher (in mass murdering) to Otis, but he has more personality than that. He's a man full of contradictions, a man that has a very hard choice to make in the end of the movie, a man that has is full of nuances, but that still consists into a very dangerous serial killer. We have many hints of his past life, and it somehow justifies all of his horrible acts. Otis is different. He discovers a passion in murder and rape, but doesn't control himself, ""exaggerates"" too much. And Henry is aware of that. The character of Otis becomes slowly something totally different than what it was before. At first, he's a pretty normal man, with a minor violent behavior, but discovers suddenly a way to express his rage. To me, Otis seemed like a stupid junkie while Henry seemed like an experimented and cautious addict of killing people. Otis' sister, Becky,is important, but not for her evolution. She falls in love with Henry, who simply doesn't know how to react to somebody's feelings. Becky doesn't have a very important role, but her character becomes useful for one thing, and only one: love. And that's the point where Henry will be full of contradictions. And that's the most important thing, because it tops Henry's deranged mind. Henry is a nice character to analyze.
But, even with all that said, you'll never know how brilliant the ending is if you don't see it. So, overall, the urban yet middle-class setting makes this film very realistic, the complex characters make it twisted, the brutality makes it shocking and intense, and the music, directing and atmosphere are a huge contribution to this movie, that is, for sure, not the most interesting to watch, because you somehow stay pretty distant to the characters and atmosphere, but the whole thing has lots of qualities. Pretty enjoyable, and terrifying enough. ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is a great movie. It's a different approach to a serial killer's life, way more original than movies such as ""Strangeland"", ""Resurrection"", and other thrillers that are not bad, but do not focus enough on the killer's mind...and in ""Henry"", they did not make that mistake.
I give it 7/10, but it's really close to an 8.
And, by the way, I just couldn't believe they made a sequel to this film. Really, this fact deceived me (though I haven't seen the second film), because the ending of the first one was perfect, and a sequel simply ruins all of its meaning.",1065484800,2,6252,4.633333333333334

981976,5,6305191883,"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (John McNaughton, 1986)
Whoa. It really is that good.
John McNaughton (Homicide: Life on the Street) really ripped it up with his first fictional feature film. His previous offering, a documentary, put him in the perfect frame of mind to direct this rather loose biopic, and the documentary quality of the photography is one of the many, many things about this movie that works on every possible level.
The casting of the film is absolutely perfect. Henry Lee Lucas is played my Michael Rooker in his big screen debut; eighteen years later, Rooker (nominated for Best Actor by three different film societies for his portrayal of Lucas) is a household name in Hollywood and has filled bills for many of the A-list directors. Ottis Toole is played by Tom Towles (who sounds more articulate than the real Toole ever did, a benefit to the film, to be sure), making his second big screen appearance. Towles has also gone on to a modicum of big-screen success, mostly in horror films (House of 1000 Corpses, the 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead). Toole's fourteen-year-old cousin Becky is made a twenty-five-year-old sister, possibly to stop from alienating both the audience and the MPAA, and is similarly well-played by Tracy Arnold, who then all but vanished from Hollywood. The three of them, living together in a small apartment, interact in the most ominous of ways throughout the movie, as McNaughton delves into the character of his somewhat fictionalized serial killer.
And what a character it is. Henry is the ultimate sociopath, a man who leads his life for the sole purpose of depriving other living things of theirs. Simply put, killing, for Henry, is fun. As the movie opens, he is living with Toole (a former cellmate), and we are treated to a montage of some of Henry's former victims. Toole has not yet progressed to killing, but is nothing more than a keg of dynamite with a very short fuse Henry is itching to light. Then Becky moves out of her house and into Toole's, and the whole situation explodes.
Those expecting your standard horror film are not going to get it. Despite the movie's original X rating (which was surrendered the year after its release, and the film is now listed as unrated), don't expect the gore factor of the films that usually make it to America unrated (Fulci, Lenzi, you know the drill). The MPAA rated Henry X in no small part because of the disturbing nature of the subject matter and the way in which that subject matter is presented; you can't make a film about a guy who hates women and spends his free time killing them without being a tad politically incorrect, of course. That the viewer comes to identify with Henry, thanks to Rooker's brilliant portrayal, makes this all the more disturbing. (And makes the movie's last scene, despite its complete absence of gore, the movie's biggest and most emotional sucker punch.) Simply put, this is a supremely disturbing film; as close to onscreen poetry as one is likely to find. I cannot recommend it highly enough; it made my all-time 100 best films list in very short order. **** ",1056067200,5,3119,4.7652495378927915
981977,1,6305191883,"I've been avoiding this one for years and then I find it's Laurel and Hardy with only marginally more violence. Transcendentally jejune, it stars Micheal Rooker (his screen mum's a hooker) as the eponymous Henry who has a dilemma. ""Let me think!"" he yells, which not not being his strongest suit, forces him to a previously held conviction, ""I am a serial killer"" and at the end of the film he rests his case. I said...never mind. Before then, this laughable film had already reached it's nadir with a seduction scene to the accompaniment of a blousey sax.
There's some commentary on the film's censorship history, but I couldn't be bothered. The BBFC has finally wised up to the fact that the biggest danger film's of this ilk pose to the public is to their individual IQ's.

981980,5,6305191883,"... What I find most horrifying in movies is human sadness, tragedy. In other words, the depiction of characters we can identify with being forced to suffer at the hands of characters who feel no remorse for their actions. What's even more horrifying is when the viewer can actually care for or identify with the culprits. That's the kind of movie ""Henry"" is. What's really scary about this movie is that it dwells more deeply inside the psychology of a killer than any movie I've ever seen, and that once you get to know him...he's really not such a bad guy. This is somebody you might be seeing every day in a gas station or restaurant, wishing him a good day, and having him respond in kind. And then you part ways and go on with your lives. You know what you're going to do, but he could be going to do the things Henry does in this film. That's what's horrifying about this. The character of Otis is much more obviously demented, actually, than Henry : He just simply is one that would be rejected by society automatically. But Henry actually has good qualities. He seems human. Everybody in this movie seems human. And by the end of the film you get the sense that there is no human life Henry is capable of valuing enough for it to break through the sickness in his soul. It's painful, it's depressing, it's gut-wrenching, and it's very disturbing. It's like watching a real-life documentary of the type of person we hear about on the news constantly. I would put this on a list with my favorite horror movies. The list would also include ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Last House on the Left,"" ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and ""Halloween."" Like those movies and other favorites, what makes ""Henry"" so effective is that it's set in such a realistic setting. That's what makes the horror so, well, horrifying. It's damn good filmmaking. Interestingly, I know people who saw this film and weren't scared by it at all, or disturbed. I could never understand why, but I know people who had the same reaction to the other films I just mentioned. One time I insisted some friends of mine see this, telling them how horrifying it was, and they weren't impressed at all. One of them even said it wasn't as scary as Freddy Krueger. Interesting. Then another, who was more knowledgeable about the art of film, said something to the effect of : it could be the times we live in. I think he was onto something. More appropriately, some people expect spectacle from a horror movie. When they don't get it, they feel they were cheated, which is why ""Blair Witch"" had so many detractors. Most people I know who saw this movie told me it really got to them. Like ""Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Last House,"" it's a little too real for many people's good.

982098,5,6305191883,"In the early 1980s, a group of guys wanted to make a new kind of horror film. Due to a very limited budget and time constraints, they knew they couldn't make one involving complex special effects and hideous-looking monsters - gore was not really an option. John McNaughton, first time Director, decided on a film about the everyday life a serial killer, set in modern day America. Much of the shoot would be on location, so no flashy soundstages or huge sets to eat up the budget. They cast an unknown in the lead and kept the cast and crew minimal. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer was born.
The effect of watching this film will flood you with many emotions as you go through it - anger, fear, empathy, sympathy, disgust to name but a few. It's very simple plot - a serial killer moves in with his ex-con cellmate and sister, then goes round killing people, is disturbingly simple. Absolutely everything about this picture works - the shoddy locations, the precision character acting (easily Michael Rooker's best film and his most intense performance) and matter-of-fact manner in which the murders happen, make this one of the most disturbing films ever made.
I think it is a masterpiece and creates feelings in the audience that go well beyond any that the huge Hollywood blockbusters could hope to get near to. It is I would say, the most disturbing film I have ever seen (and I've watched many, many horror films) because it works on an entirely different level - these are people you pass in the street, that live near to you. McNaughton offers no explanation as to why the things we watch on the screen happen, they just do - which ultimately makes this more terrifying. Thus, we are left with an almost flawless character study of a serial killer in his prime, no hope for redemption, Henry kills because he enjoys it, no other reason and we, as the audience are implicated into that, by our fascination with evil deeds and violence (otherwise why in the first place, would you even want to watch a film like this?).
Perhaps the most interesting element of the entire film is right at the beginning before it starts - a warning is displayed, giving the audience a taster of just what they're going to experience. McNaughton has oft claimed that anyone who sits through the whole film needs it, that those who leave early or don't watch it, don't need it. We are left with a film that makes you feel depressed about enjoying onscreen violence, forcing you to question just why you'd want to see people being killed and surely this can only be a good thing?
The DVD is fully uncut and includes insights by McNaughton which are interesting and add to the general feeling of the film - it's certainly worth getting this version if any, but be warned - this is a one-off - no ghosts, ghouls or buckets of gore, nothing so easy I'm afraid.",1026172800,74,2846,4.58235294117647

I decided when I started writing my opinions of movies, (yes, I know... they're just my OPINIONS), that I would only write about my favorites, why waste space on something I didn't like? But this movie so repulsed me, I'm still mad I wasted 90 minutes. I consider myself liberal, open-minded, against censorship, pro ""artistic freedom"", etc....but this film almost turned me into Nancy Reagan. The title says it all. It is a ""portrait"" of a serial killer and the sickos in his life, and their conscienceless exploits. The scene where they terrorize an innocent family and rape and kill the mother in front of her subdued little boy, all while they film it for later kicks,  is enough to make me vomit still. If you find this entertainment, then you need help, or at least some new hobbies. I'm not against violence in films when it's pertinent to the story as a whole, but I still can't figure out why anyone would have even wanted to pursue this project. I made the mistake of watching it. If you're a person (and sane) who wants to get so depressed that you'll feel like crawling under a rock, watch this ""entertainment"". Otherwise, throw it in the garbage, where it belongs. There...that's my ONE negative review.",1023408000,15,1240,4.662100456621005
982101,5,6305191883,"I finally saw this movie last week and I must say this is one truly great movie. I think what I liked most about the film was the realism. No monsters, cannibals, or aliens. Just a regular guy who is completly out of his mind. I guess the best way to sum up the movie is that as a young boy Henry was abused by his mother. She used to have sex with different men all the time and force Henry to watch. If he didn't watch she would beat him. Sounds like a nice lady huh? Anyway I guess that screwed him up pretty good and he started killing people. The reason for my title really only relates to one part. Henry and Ottis(his buddy who joins him in some of the killings)go to see a big fat slob who sells video equiptment and tv's. When the guy won't sell them a color tv for only fifty bucks, Henry and Ottis say never mind and were going to leave. But the fat slob starts putting them down and calling them names, just being a real d%*k. So, as so many of us who has run-ins with these type of jerks would love to do, Henry and Ottis kill the guy in a really cool way. I don't want to give away to much. But on the other hand, like in the situation with the innocent family, you wish the same would happen to Henry and Ottis themselves. This is a excellent movie, well made for a low budget film, and very realistic. I am pretty much a jaded horror fan but this one got to me a little. Just because it could be the guy next door or somebody you've known all your life doing these things. Great for a saturday night with a few beers. Oh, just a brief note on another movie I just won on e-bay. If you can sit through a movie with subtitles, try to get a copy of ""Red to Kill"" on dvd. It is a orential movie but the acting is great and the maniac is really disturbing and believable. It is one sick flick. The only reason I'm mentioning this other movie is that I haven't seen a ""bad guy"" in a long time that was as nasty and derranged as this one. You can find this movie real cheap on e-bay. I think I paid seven or eight bucks for it. Anyway get Henry and check it out, you won't be disapointed.",1017705600,2,2097,3.971563981042654

982103,5,6305191883,"In the 1990s there was a flood of ""smart"" serial killer movies, madmen who toyed with the cops and left clues for the detectives in charge to solve or else they were as much to blame for the deaths as the killer himself. These movies such as SEVEN and BONE COLLECTOR are good films, inviting you to play along, but the sad truth is the real reason most killers don't get caught is more like the reasons in HENRY...which makes the film all the more brilliant than the ""smart"" killer films. HENRY chooses to sink its teeth into the reality of a serial killer's life: here we have Henry, a low-class illiterate sexually repressed drifter who has numerous qualities that'd make you love the guy, but there is that nuisance of a tendency he has to just go out and butcher whoever he happens to come across first. Hell, he even helps his friend Otis kill someone just because Otis wa angry about something else! The film is essentially plotless, the camera drifting (just like Henry) across scenes of whitetrash melodrama and ruthless home invasions. The murder scenes here are far from the FRIDAY THE 13TH or HALLOWEEN style of flashy fun. In fact the only death scene that will make anyone cheer is when Henry smashes a TV set over the head of an annoying fat [person] selling hot electronic equipment out of what looks to be his garage. All in all, a shocking dose of reality that is an antidote to all those goofy slasher flicks that flood the American market. Course everyone is so burnt out on all the dopey FRIDAY knockoffs, who knows if they'll be able to appreciate the real deal?",1014681600,4,1583,4.538461538461538
982104,5,6305191883,"I don't know if these days, this movie is that great of an idea to watch. If you're already freaked out by the news, and too scared to do much, you might want to hold off. But if you feel nice and safe when you are somewhere alone....and want to really feel something cold slowly move up your spine...
As far as non-supernatural horror goes, this movie and Last House on the Left are the scariest movies I've ever seen.
I saw this at a film festival and the audience was very, very quiet (except when they screamed or gasped). My friend and I just sat there quietly cowering most of the time. It's just way too realistic. The opening and closing are probably the most frightening, and we don't even see Henry killing anyone, just the bodies of his victims and their terrified screams in the background, echoing. It will give you chills down your spine.
The stuff in the movie that scared me wasn't any big ""jumps"" or gore, just very disturbing, creepy moments (especially if you knew someone who was been the victim of a homicide, as I do). My friend I saw it with worked at the city prosecutors office and heard about plenty of local murder cases and said it rang very, very true to life. One of the most chilling scenes is early on, when Henry goes to a mall and just sits patiently in the parking lot, scanning. The camera looks coldly and calculatedly at different women in the parking lot from Henry's point of view. There are so many shots you almost start to wonder what the point of the scene is until it hits you: they are ALL potential victims, this is how he looks at women. I have always been careful as a woman whenever I am alone but after seeing the film, to this DAY I do not walk to my car alone at the mall without my mace in my hand, and I look all around me and never turn my back on anyone. The movie also does not glamorize the killing or violence against women at all. Also, it's a good primer on home and personal safety. (a good rule- Do not EVER let a stranger into your house when you are home alone if you were not expecting him.  Think I'm paranoid? Watch this movie and see how safe you feel).
The plot sounds simple but it's not boring. The movie follows the exploits of Henry, a young man who is practically a textbook case of a serial killer (male, white, 30's, drifter, soft-spoken, shy). Conflict comes when his disgusting nasty inbred cousin Otis Toole stays with him, along with his pathetic sister. One night Otis and Henry pick up a couple of prostitutes and are having sex with them in the car. Henry kills both of them sort of offhandedly, with no more emotion than you would swat a fly. Otis starts joining him on his exploits. Henry is more sympathetic than Otis, however, because while Henry does these things because he is sick and doesn't have a choice, Otis seems to get off on them, and also should know better. Things sorta go downhill from there, and the sister complicates things because she is so desperately lonely that Henry starts to look good to her. It culminates in one of the most chilling, downbeat endings of all time. I still find this one of the most disturbing, unsettling movies ever made. You haven't seen a really scary movie until you see this movie.",1013731200,14,3218,4.37228714524207
982105,3,6305191883,"The acting in HENRY is very natural, but the subject material is a bit sick.  There is one scene especially which was disturbing for me, and that was a house invasion where a family is wiped out in a realistic slaughter.  I usually am not disturbed by gore, but the way it was presented was upsetting to me.  The acting in the movie was realistic and exceptionally well done.  It doesn't seem to have a moral to the story, because the killer does not get caught and goes on to murder again in Henry II, although I felt this actor did a much better job.  Another thing which disturbed me was the running time, which is shown as 130 minutes, but ran just a bit over 80 minutes.

982106,5,6305191883,"Most horror films are like roller coaster rides--we get  thrills and chills, but we also laugh; we know we're safe. It's only an illusion of fear, not fear itself. John McNaughton's Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is fear itself. We cannot laugh after this movie, cannot recount its most famous scenes  with pleasure, because this film stands as one of the bleakest,  most relentless depictions of a murderer ever put to celluloid. It's practically a documentary. I rank it with ""Psycho"" as one of the greatest of all-time horror films.
This film is light years from Hollywood treatments of serial  killers. Sure, Se7en was really good, but come ON people, when did you EVER hear of a murderer with such an apocalyptic, clever, and convenient M.O.? Henry, as played by Michael Rooker, is an emotional blank, a human cipher. He's not sympathetic at all--no wisecracks, no catch-phrases, nothing that we can latch on to to understand him.
Therein lies the power of the movie. If Henry revelled in his bloodshed, we could despise him. If he suffered crippling feelings of guilt afterwards, we could pity him. But you can't do either. You just kind of watch him, hoping he won't go too far... that he'll stop soon... that some tough detective would track him down... But none of these things happen.
""It's always the same, and it's always different,"" Henry tells his friend Otis (Tom Towles), who eventually ventures out with Henry on his killing sprees. Why? Because he's stupid, restless, filled with unfocused loathing. What more of an explanation do you need? ""It's either you or them, one way or another."" That's all the rationale you'll get for Henry's compulsion, and it's as good an explanation as any.
The plot, such as it is, takes a twist for the worst when Otis' sister Becky (Tracy Arnold) comes to stay with him and Henry in Chicago. Lonely and destitute after the break-up of her marriage, she finds Henry someone she can talk to because he's not ""judgmental."" Read: he's a blank slate upon whom she can project whatever she wants, and right now she wants someone to understand her. In one subtly chilling scene, she tells Henry how she had been beaten and raped repeatedly by her father as a teen. Henry says to her in his deadend rasp, ""Didn't get along with your Daddy, huh?""
Henry's normally placid demeanor dissolves only when he talks about his abusive mother. I like how he misremembers how he murdered her. That strikes me as really true and accurate; serial killers are like THIS. ""It ain't what she done,"" he says, ""it's how she done it."" We see how brutality breeds brutality, how violence and despair and rage are almost a genetic code. But the director, John McNaughton, isn't making a message movie--you gotta pick up on this stuff yourself. Go watch an Oliver Stone movie if you want socially redeemable violence (which is an oxymoron).
While certain watchdogs of morality in film howl that the realistic depiction of violence in movies ultimately desensitizes the viewer, nothing could be further from the truth in Henry. Can anyone watch the videotape sequence herein, where Henry and Otis slaughter an entirely family and not be left feeling disturbed, violated, empty? The murders are virtually bloodless, and yet it may be the most unsettling screen violence I have ever seen (well, up until I saw Mr. Orange's torture bit in 1992). I wanted it to... go away... But then, real violence makes you feel that way. That's what makes Henry brilliant--no cheap thrills. McNaughton is playing for real. Like many people, I cringe when I see violence in a film, but unlike many, I can't turn away. We need films this raw and immediate and rough to explore such foul things--you can't expect Hollywood to do it.
""But if you strangle one, and stab another, and one you cut up and one you don't, then the police don't know what to,"" Henry explains. And there's the moral center of this movie. Sorry. This is not about good and evil, because there is no such thing in the serial killer's world. Don't pretend that there is. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is a horror film in which the truly horrified is not the character on the screen, as it too often is, but the audience itself.

A serial killer who leaves his victims mangled, slit, and often undressed. It would be sooo easy to turn this into a drive-in stalk-and-slash skin flick. Thank God they saw the possibilities beyond that.
This film is brutally honest and nihilistic. It doesn't sing it's message to you in a sweet voice, it just displays the cruel actions of characters who are too far gone to know exactly what they are doing. Urban isolation, anger management, they kill for all or none of these reasons, the viewer can never really tell. That's what makes this film so great. Often, serial-killers are so diseased mentally that their murders are beyond comprehension. The viewer is forced to watch the film and determine for themselves why these innocent people are killed. This movie was so explicit that it was held without a rating for several years, with the dreaded ""X"" rating threatened to be applied. It was eventually released un-rated, in uncut form.

He is brutal, without conscience, unpredicatable and deceptively smart.  His mind is a cesspool churning with a lust for death.  He and his equally deranged friend Otis, kill and kill and kill...never once seeming the least bit remorseful or ashamed.  I wouldn't say this movie is as scary as it is disturbing.  The graphic scenes of violence are haunting.  They stick with you long after the movie is done.  The slaughter of a suburban family and random shooting are particularly unsettling.

As harrowing as any experience can be, I must say I was truly disturbed after watching this film. Right from the first scene showing the bodies of some of the people Henry's killed, to the very quiet final scene, this film is truly a piece of grisly, yet wonderful Art. Director John McNaughton keeps the suspense running about the fate of the other characters, while he inexorably draws us in, slowly, bit by bit, murder by murder. Tracy Arnold plays a streetwise girl, who is also the sister of Tom Towles in the film. Tom is shown as being a very lecherous character, not sparing cute things, male of female; that aspect makes for some funny (albeit disturbing) scenes. The film undoubtedly belongs to Michael Rooker, who shines blindingly under the able tutelage of John. Some scenes are way too gory to be even DESCRIBED - such is the power and intensity of the film. Some moments are really, really bizarre, especially the ones that include the murders the two lowlives commit, deliberately, slowly, and very cruelly. There is no Police investigation ever, mainly because most of those that die are not THAT prominent...most have sleazy lives, worm-eaten and miserable. But there are also some decent people, living the good life, that fall prey to the two monsters.

""There are other ways of learning about the hind feet of a mule, than being kicked by them."" -- Uncle Remus, ""Song of the South""
In this ""review,"" I wish to discuss what happened to the real Henry Lucas, on whom this film was based.  Several years ago, Texas Governor George Bush (now US President) commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment.  This was the only death sentence Bush commuted in Texas.
It was shown that Henry was actually innocent of the murder he was convicted of.  A time card had shown him to be at his job in Florida the day before the murder was committed in Texas.  Also, many if not all of his several hundred murder confessions also appeared to be false, and even incredible.
It just goes to show how different things can be from what you think you know.",998524800,2,990,4.267379679144385
982235,4,6305191883,"""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" is based on the life of Henry Lee Lucas, who got his jollies by committing gratuitous acts of murder in a variety of forms. It's a brutal piece of filmmaking, an in-your-face horror film that possesses little story but really does not need one. This is not a movie about solving a mystery or finding a killer's identity; it's about murder, and little else.
What makes a film such as this scary is the fact that Henry is not a killer in a hockey mask, or someone who comes back only on a certain night each year to claim a victim here or there. He kills as he pleases, something he does to relieve his tensions and stresses. No money? Go kill a man and take his Visa card. It's this kind of blunt attitude that permeates the entire picture.
He lives with his friend Otis, whose sister has come to live with them until she gets on her feet. As Otis's sister becomes strangely drawn to Henry, Otis also begins to uncover the sensation one gets when killing someone, and begins going on drives with Henry to exercise that sensation.
There's little else to discuss in terms of plot; the movie is not concerned with developing the story. Director John McNaughton throws out any and all horror clichs and creates a film that is strikingly original yet extremely controversial. Some have hailed it as a masterpiece, while others have slammed it for its excessive use of violence and brutality.
I find the film to be very interesting. Watching Henry driving his car, walking the street at night, makes me think just how many people with similar skeletons in the closet do those same things each day. It makes you think about just what kind of people could be living right next door to you, or standing behind you in the grocery store. It's very chilling and unique.
But I'll never watch it again. For all its brilliance, ""Henry"" is too disturbing, too gruesome, too realistic in its acts for me to stomach another viewing. These scenes do have a purpose, yes, but once seen, they are hard to strike from the mind. A scene involving the murder of a family is haunting and almost unbearable, while the climax involving Henry and Otis is excessively violent.
So what is my final consensus on the film? A positive one. ""Henry"" is about a simple man who commits complex crimes, someone who is no different in his appearance than anyone we know in real life. The horror is more shocking than it is frightening, and while the substance is minute, the brutality is not. ""Henry"" will be remembered by all who see, even those who choose not to recall its events.",998438400,6,2580,4.550537634408602

The plot is simple enough; Henry visits Chicago during what is obviously for him an ongoing travelog of serial murder.  He joins up with the slimy parolee Otis and his hard luck sister and quickly draws them in to his web of unremorseless murder.  There is one scene, in which Henry and Otis film themselves slaughtering a suburban family, that is as disturbing as anything I've witnessed in a movie.  For sheer horrific power, it is absolutely without peer.  Director John McNaughton is hip to the fact that blood and gore are not what makes a scene scary, but instead plausibility and tone.

982381,4,6305191883,"Directed in a psuedo-documentary style, director John McNaughton's brilliant 'Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer' allows a look into a diseased mind. It is harsh and hollow, lined with an air of realism that chills to the bone. Serial killers have long fasinated the world, often times elevating them to superstar status. No one has any clue of what they are celebrating. They are looking at a monster, a person who kills people for satisfaction, sexual stimulation, and sometimes for the sheer joy of it. 'Henry' is different from most films in that it's characters are not painted as charming, good-looking, even interesting people. Michael Rooker's portrayal of Henry is so disturbing because it has no center to it. We find out that he was sexually and emotionally abused by his mother when he was a child (eventually killing her) but that doesn't seem to be why he kills women. It is simply what turned him off to the world, detaching him from the guilt of what he does. He kills because he's bored, or because the mood strikes him. His partner in crime, Otis (played by Tom Towles) is equally repulsive, an ex-con who feeds off Henry's distaste for mankind. His first kill is an adrenaline rush for him, his bloodlust soon becomes uncontrollable. The violence isn't very graphic, but it's the tone, the callous disregard for humanity, the way they simply off people without a hint of regret or hesitation, that gets under your skin. After videotaping themselves murdering an entire family in their own living room, Otis sits watching the tape on TV, switching it into slow motion, savoring every second of the family's pain. What was McNaughton trying to accomplish with this film? I'm not too sure. It's not exploitation so he could not have been looking for a mainstream hit. Perhaps he was simply showing us what humanity can degrade into, a darker side which lies inside of us all, waiting to come to the surface. Many will see 'Henry' and be disgusted, regard it as trash cinema. And certainly it is not a redeeming feature. But it is genious in the way it portrays the great American enigma of the serial killer for what it is and not what the movies have made it out to be.",985132800,7,2186,4.710182767624021

Then I saw Henry...
My review is 5 Stars because the film is simply chilling.  I've never even felt this sick watching a movie.  In fact, the first time that I watched it, I turned it off half way through!  Even I had never done that before!  Horrified and repelled, I rented it again and the film had lost none of it's impact.  That's why this is a great movie.  Presented in a documentary style fashion, the film is a straightforward nightmare that is essential viewing for fans who like to have controversial and important movies in their collection.  Rent it first... I think I'll buy it next time I go to the video store!

982385,2,6305191883,"I bought into the hype surrounding Henry and rented it.  Honestly?  I really didn't get what the controversy was about.  The movie was riddled with cliches (""Turn it on""), and it does not in any way, shape or form, hold true to the real story behind Lucas and Ottis Toole's deranged partnership.  Add a rather hokey music sequence and it comes across as a violent movie of the week.  The opening montages of the victims was effective, and the scene with the family IS disturbing and graphic enough to make you go ""Whoah.""  But one whoah doesn't make it a must-have.
I suggest those with a fetish for serial killers read about Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole instead of watching this.  The real thing will keep you up all night- this almost put me to sleep.",975024000,2,756,4.474452554744525

Not only is it based on the exploits of real life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas and his equally  whacked-out sidekick Otis Toole, but director John McNaughton chose to film  the movie in a bleak, realistic, documentary style adding an uncanny sense  of voyeurism to the bombardment of vicious murders, rapes and all out  debauchery.

982388,2,6305191883,"The movie itself gets 5 stars. No one who sees it will forget it. Case closed.
The DVD is another story. The extras are nothing to write home  about. The ""trailers"" are actually video trailers, like the  ""Coming soon to home video"" spots you see at the start of a  rental video. So basically you're seeing an ad for a DVD you just bought,  instead of the original theatrical trailer. The other trailer is for the  sequel; big whoop. What I saw didn't inspire me to buy what looks to be a  lame follow-up.
And don't believe the hype about this being the  ""director's edition."" This edition is the same version you've  always seen, in theaters, on VHS, and now on DVD. McNaughton never cut  anything from the film, so it went out unrated. So the ""director's  edition"" has always been available. (Maybe they mean the DVD has an  interview with the director. If so, big whoop again.)
But fans of  ""Henry"" really won't be able to get over how awful it looks on  DVD. The transfer is unacceptable -- it looks like they took it off a  second-generation VHS copy. It's not even letterboxed, for God's sake,  obviously because they pulled it off the video transfer. This modern  classic deserved better. For now, if you own it on tape, stick with that  until someone comes out with a better edition, with say a running  commentary, extras other than the no-frills basics you get on any $9.95  DVD, and most of all, A DECENT TRANSFER.",966816000,14,1424,4.513725490196078

982390,4,6305191883,"This is a true horror film. The main character is not a burn victim come back to life, a demon from hell or a backwoods cannibal with a chainsaw, but just your average loser. Henry is probably much like the polite, but  strange, neighbor next door, who really hasn't made much of his  life.
With his prison pal Otis in hand, the duo kill and maim people the  way most people would order their breakfast at McDonalds. Witness in one  scene how they pretend to be broken down, so they can shoot a man who  thinks he's coming to their aide.
Much like Man Bites Dog, this film  could be seen as a parable on modern society's bloodlust. After getting a  home video camera, the pair start to film their exploits, so they can watch  and enjoy them later on. Henry and Otis watching themselves kill a family  on video, is almost mirroring the viewers at home watching this film.
If  you're expecting a non-stop, all out bloodbath, then you'll be  disappointed. The film is very slow, quiet & low key. The violence is  much less than your average slasher film, but much like Man Bites Dog, it's  infinitely more disturbing and revolting, since it almost seems real.
Not  a single laugh in the film, people who liked Man Bites Dog's offbeat, sick  humor will be disappointed to find it's not here.
Like I said in my MDB  review, if you're game, be sure to rent this. And if you like Henry and you  haven't already, be sure to get Man Bites Dog, since it mines similiar  ground.",959731200,,1467,4.41044776119403

Most other movies about  serial killers involve the pursuit.  This movie is essentially filmed  inside the mind of a serial killer.  It was very disturbing.  The movie  wasn't gory like Seven, Henry just matter-of-factly killed people.  Seeing  it in a stripped down version as compared to other movies, it garnered a  greater sense of realism.

I turned a  friend of mine on to it; she was disturbed enough to decide to never see  the film again, though it was one of the most chilling movies she had ever  seen (she loves good, intellectual, chilling movies such as this).

This movie did not touch base at all in the  mind of a serial killer. The serial killer is very deliperate in his  picking of victims. There is nothing random about it. He is usually  extreamily intelligent, has a method to his madness, and is quite  deliberate in his execution. If you want a true picture of a serial killer  read John Douglas' ""Journey into Darkness"" or  ""Mindhunter"". Althought they are books, they will scare you,  because they are real cases. John Douglas was a real FBI Profiler on  murders and serial killing cases. Having read numerous books on the  subject, my money for a true sence of a serial killer movie would be  ""Kiss the Girls"". This(Henry) was not a bad movie for the time,  but Henry Lee Lucas was no ""Einstein"" in the serial kiling field.  He was frightening because he was sick, but not the intellectual killing  machine that most serial killers are.""Copycat"" was more realistic  as well.

The copy I'd seen before was exactly the same as this (I went through the movie and found no new shots,  scenes, or cuts).  The documentary with John McNaughton looks rushed and  incomplete -- nothing about the production history of the movie, the  involvement of Tom Towles and Tracy Arnold, or the music.  It does feature  McNaughton's funny description of his first meeting with Michael Rooker,  which is good for Henry fanatics like me.
Though the ""extras""  are a little disappointing as a whole, that doesn't change the fact that  this is one of the most intense films of the past two decades.  Lodge  Kerrigan's Clean, Shaven is the only one that pops to my mind right now  with the same amount of tension.  Henry triumphs on the strength of a  dedicated cast (even making use of Tom Towles' annoying habit of overacting  his creep roles), great writing, and McNaughton's cinematic sense.
Two  movies were made around the same time that were based on Henry Lee Lucas:  This one, and 1987's Confessions of a Serial Killer.  Just go with Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer.  Chilling and emotive, engrossing and  shocking, this is one of the rare occasions in cinema where a horror film  has achieved true dignity.",921024000,3,1327,4.774336283185841
982735,4,6305191883,"28. HENRY: portrait of a serial killer (horror-thriller, 1992) Henry (Michael Rooker) lives with his ex-prison buddy Otis whose sister Becky moves in with them. Despite his shy nature Henry and Becky are attracted to  each other. One night Otis and Henry go out with 2 prostitutes. In a fit of  rage Henry kills one of them and with Otis' help kills the other. At first  having second thoughts Otis gets a taste for killing and they set out on a  murder spree. Otis first shoots down a passing motorist. They then break  into a house and slaughter a whole family (dog and all). They record  everything on tape. Otis begins to lose control as his perverse sexual  urges lead him to rape his own sister. When Henry finds out things take a  turn for the worst.
Critique: This graphic, low-budget venture was made  in 1986 but due to the material was released 6 years later. The story is  based on the confessions of serial killer Henry Lukas (who allegedly  confessed to more than 500 murders). Since the plot eschews from any  reference of real events the theme is poorly presented. Writer-director  John McNaughton concentrates more on the nature of killing and the people  that commit them. The only sure thing we know as being Henry's murderous  excuse was that his prostitute mother beat him up, and sometimes forced him  to watch her have sex with clients. Besides that the scary thing is that we  don't really get to understand his (or anyone else's) motives for killing.  As is the case with most low-budget films the use of grainy stock footage  and cheap props prove very realistic. McNaughton shows flair by the use of  hand-held cameras (particularly in the disturbing 'family slaughter') and  good use of cinematography (invoking a visionary paranoia and suspense).  The ending further distances us from the nature of evil.
