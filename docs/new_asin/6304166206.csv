797147,3,6304166206,"Like reviewer ""tokieyasu"", I have read all of J.L.Burke's books, and have ""fanticized"" with friends about who should play Dave!! I'm not kidding! And , we both, ""tok and us"", came up with the same name! Tommy Lee Jones!!! So, Tommy Lee. are you listening. reading?? Alec Baldwin in ""Heaven's Prisoners"" was OK, but he is definitely too young!!! Dave is older than me, and I'm 58!! I know this because of his dates of attending college (briefly) and his total resume, and particularly, his out-look on South La.! I am a South La. native! And I have met at least 5 people who could play Dave Robicheaux, if they were actors, and another 5 who ""think"" they're Dave Robicheaux!!!So, all you powers that be, get with it! Let's make ""Electric Mist"" -one of our favorites- with Tommy Lee Jones!",996105600,5,787,4.628571428571429
797148,1,6304166206,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago and was so disgusted with it that to this day I still tell people that it was the worst movie I've ever seen. Nothing in the plot made any sense. It seemed that the whole 'conflict' with the drugdealers could have resolved in the first five minutes of the movie. It was quite apparent that the character's actions were motivated solely by the fact that a movie needed to be made. In other words, there was no character development and everything that happened in the movie only happened because it was a movie and would never apply in reality or anywhere else other than this incredibly long and frusterating movie. I would urge anyone who is even remotely considering watching this movie to at once put an end to those thoughts so s/he will be spared 2 hours of torture.",984700800,2,810,4.442953020134228
797149,3,6304166206,"I have read all of James Lee Burke's David Robicheaux novels.  They are  fantastic and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for some good  reading.
While reading the books I have often tried to pictures which  actors could play Robicheaux.  A few come to mind: Bruce Willis, Tommy Lee  Jones, Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin.  In fact, Baldwin was the guy I  pictured the most in the role.  And I was amazed to find out he actually  was starring and producing the film.
For whatever reasons the film does  not fully work.  The acting, casting and direction are great.  But the film  just does not cut it.
If you are fans of the books, the movie is  interesting just to see visually what we have been picturing in all these  novels.  If you are unfamiliar with the books you will find the movie  average at best.
My advice is to read some of the books and then check  out the film.",965779200,30,884,4.345679012345679
797150,4,6304166206,"Now, I know the above sounds cliche, but in this case, it's really true.  I give the movie four stars for atmosphere and for really trying.  I watched this movie twice and enjoyed it both times, for the cinematography  alone-- which captures everything from the dense, powerful nature of the  Louisiana swamps and bayous; to the gothic power of Louisiana Roman  Catholic churches; to the cracked, decaying but colorful beauty of New  Orleans itself.  And where the movie stuck to the book, it was a very good  adaptation.  Baldwin falls a bit short in his characterization of  Robicheaux, looking more often like he was having ""digestive""  problems than internal angst, but he obviously loves the character and does  his best to depict a very internalized personality.  Eric Roberts, by no  means matching the physically imposing power of the novel's Bubba Rocque,  gives his character the dark, attractive charisma and vitality that author  James Lee Burke so often infuses the ""gray"" characters Robicheaux  encounters in the novels, and adds some fun and zing to it, as well.  Teri  Hatcher is damn nasty, beautiful and seductive in the femme fatale role,  and Masterson pulls off her role with just the right amount of sympathy and  sass (though physically, each actress matches her opposite character in the  novel, but it's not a problem here).  It's unfortunate that Kelly Lynch  doesn't give Robicheaux's doomed wife such memorable character, but in the  novel series the character has one entire book behind her before her tragic  end.  The real problems come with the Hollywood ending--  why they did this  instead of the more realistic and affecting ending in the novel, I'll never  know (I recommend you read the book to find out-- it's a much more  satisfying and telling conclusion).  And the connection to the Giacano  family, a recurring Robicheaux nemesis in some of the novels, but not the  one on which the movie based, was unnecessary.  However, the highly  action-packed trolley car and rooftop chase, a purely cinematic addition to  the novel's plot does work, very well, in my opinion.  These kind of  additions are needed for the big screen and I appreciated it.  Lastly, the  production was very good (Baldwin was one of the producers of the film),  just as in Baldwin's ""The Shadow"" movie, which suffered  ultimately from a poor script, and I have to commend him-- this movie very  much seemed a labor of love.  I wish this film had been more successful,  because seeing other installments of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux series on  the big screen would be very welcome to me, but alas, despite the  ""good ol' college try"" this will never be.  But do pick up the  movie and watch it for what it does offer, and then get hold of the Burke  novels and you'll really be in for a treat.",925171200,74,2807,4.828752642706131

797466,1,6304166206,"Terrible James Lee Burke adaptation features what is likely a career worst performance from Alec Baldwin as Dave Robicheaux and glacial pacing, both courtesy of director Phil Joanou who also brought out the worst in Richard Gere in Final Analysis a couple years earlier.  Richard Gere is not someone known for badmouthing actors or directors but he made a very rare exception where Final Analysis and Phil Joanou were concerned.  Joanou didn't get to direct another Hollywood film for twelve years after Heaven's Prisoners--he's actually lucky that he ever found employment again.

Heaven's Prisoners sat on the shelf for a couple years before finally getting a doomed theatrical release but it should have been dumped straight to video.  The plot concerns ex-cop Dave Robicheaux who is retired from the force and from drinking and is living the quiet life with wife Annie (Kelly Lynch), running a boat rental business.  But when a twin engine plane crashes less than a hundred yards from his boat Robicheaux goes into automatic hero mode, swimming into the sunken plane to find a bunch of already dead bodies and a still living little girl desperately treading water with a couple inches of air.

Dave rescues the child which his wife unofficially adopts (she's illegal anyway, her parents are dead and she only speaks Spanish so it's not like anyone else wants her).  But after a DEA agent starts poking his head around Dave's property asking questions about the crash Robicheaux decides to start his own investigation which turns out to be a really bad idea.  It's hard to understand exactly what Dave Robicheaux is trying to accomplish besides making some big time hoods very uneasy and putting his family (I'm including the little girl) in completely unnecessary danger.

Alec Baldwin gives one of the dullest performances of his career--Joanou's direction of Baldwin seems to consist mostly of making him talk very, very slowly, the exact same thing he did to Richard Gere in Final Analysis.  Alec Baldwin's natural charisma is nowhere in evidence here--in fact if this was the only movie you ever saw him in you would never want to see Alec Baldwin again.

The only interesting performance in Heaven's Prisoners comes from Eric Roberts as a drug kingpin named Bubba who has known Robicheaux since childhood and who may have a hand in all the very bad things that start happening in his life.  Eric Roberts seems oddly immune from the lethargy that afflicts the rest of the male cast.  On the female side Mary Stuart Masterson is likable but unconvincing as a damaged stripper with a heart of gold and Teri Hatcher is nude and completely out of her depth as the supposed femme fatale of the film, Bubba's no good wife Claudette.

Except for a couple of reasonably well-staged action sequences Heaven's Prisoners couldn't possibly be more of a slog to sit through--it moves so slowly that at times I started to forgot what was supposed to be going on.  Heaven's Prisoners clocks in at a punishing 132 minutes, but if the actors didn't talk so slowly and with so many unnecessary dramatic pauses it would probably take a full half hour off the running time.

If you're a James Lee Burke fan you are much better off with Tommy Lee Jones and In the Electric Mist which had its own flaws but found authentic atmosphere in its Louisiana locations and featured some quite good performances, including a much more compelling take on Dave Robicheaux than Alec Baldwin manages here.  In the Electric Mist has the colorful characters and performances that are the bread and butter of the detective genre--Heaven's Prisoners, on the other hand, feels like it's always taking itself way too seriously to ever be any actual fun.  What's the point of making a genre film if not to entertain?  Phil Joanou seems to think he's directing Sophie's Choice or Macbeth but all he ends up doing is sucking every ounce of life out of what should have been some very juicy material.  With Heaven's Prisoners it's the audience that's held prisoner--if you make the mistake of checking this one out prepare to be bored, then confused, then bored again.  When you get so bored you're about to grab the remote you want to take a few seconds to consider how the same actor can be so alive in Miami Blues and Glengarry Glen Ross and so deadly dull here.",1429574400,,4328,4.813765182186235

He plays the role of recovering alcoholic (& recovering detective) so well, you forget you're watching Alec Baldwin.  That's not easy to do. Eric Roberts and Teri Hatcher are also stand out performances. Mary Masterson and Kelly Lynch less so. This is a longer than most movie, but you don't really notice it.  The soundtrack is pure heaven. Filmed in New Orleans and the surrounding area, it has the feel of the bayou and blues.

The female characters are all very well acted and Teri Hatcher was much better than she was given credit for as Claudette Rocque. The cinematography is excellent and the on-location filming in the swamps and bayous of southern Louisiana is a great asset. Having also seen the other Dave Robicheaux film ""In the Electric Mist"" with Tommy Lee Jones as Dave Robicheaux, I had held off seeing this vastly underrated film. I had pretty much thought Jones was the definitive Dave Robicheaux but Alec Baldwin does the role justice here. Baldwin, not his fault is probably a bit too handsome as compared to the descriptions given of the character in the books by James Lee Burke. Also, in the books Dave Robicheaux has a mustache.

Baldwin does a good job with Dave's character but it seems to me that Baldwin makes bad choices.  He should have franchised this part.  As in his chance with another great character (Clancy's Hunt fo Red October) he could have done a Harrison Ford (Indy was the name of the Dog?). Bad choice,instead he went on to take a part on Broadway.
The cinematograhy is great and Louisiana looks just like i remember it when i worked in Matarie in the late 70s. The infusion of great and often unappreciated music lyrics add a special dreamlike stream to the movie.
I like Bubba. Teri Hatcher's daughter of Satan acting is spot on even if her frontal nude scene was dissappointing.

There were a couple of plot points they changed which made it more satisfying on a Hollywood movie level but I won't give away spoilers.  The film did a mediocre job in showing the main character's downward spiral to drinking again.  Fans of this movie will probably want to check out the novel.

And do those reviewers each think that the mental images they personally formed while reading the book are identical to the images formed by ANY other reader of the same book!?

I am sick of reading those Amazon customer's reviews whose only REAL negative criticism of a DVD movie is that it isn't the book.

798294,2,6304166206,"I remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of HEAVEN'S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release. Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke's New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they're hampered by two things:

1.) The film's slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE!

2.) A plot that, as rendered in the film (whether it's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor, I can't be sure), never quite follows through on any of its elements. It's too bad, because these elements could've made for an exciting movie: drug dealing, illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself, essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named ""Alafair"" by the Robichouxs, after Dave's mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch, vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie's ads, none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: ""I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he'd made love as many times as he got beaten up, it would've been the sexiest picture of '96!""

To be fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes, but there's just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end abruptly just as they're about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou, Baldwin & Co. could've dredged a tighter, more involving thriller out of this if they'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is now...well, read James Lee Burke's books instead.",1121040000,9,3157,4.986717267552182

The BB King Blues music in the bars was alright but there could of been some Androux Bordoux music instead as so the movie could really live up to what they were trying to reproduce. I think all the cast did a good job (next time use some Buyoo stand-ins). Overall this movie is about the best Cajun movie around.

What makes Burke's novels so great is the psychic depth of the characters.  Each character, no matter how minor, has a birthplace, a childhood, memory and  environment that informs his or her presence in the story.  Even the scenery in his novels has history.  There are ways to bring all of this to the screen, but it doesn't happen here.  Alec Baldwin made a credible Dave Robicheaux, but the rest of the film is mostly eye candy, with the exception of Hawthorne James as the scary assassin.  James must have read the book.

Many seem to attack Alec Baldwin's portayal of the lead character, Dave Robicheaux, but I actually think he did a very respectable job. Sure his Cajun accent wasn't 100% dead on, but that isn't all that makes a character. The Robicheaux character, throughout the series of books, is a flawed character that is full of heart and that is exactly how it comes across on-screen. It seems as if every other role was perfectly cast, especially the role of Claudette (played by Teri Hatcher). Every last detail is done perfectly, from the accent down to the sultry demeanor.
The plot brings plenty of action scenes, with many scenes that bring out emotion. If the production studio hadn't been nearly broke when this movie was made (and subsequently put on the shelf for a couple of years), therefore going vastly unpublicized, it would have been more successful at the box office.

7863494,4,6304166206,"This is a solid, well-acted film with a very strong cast. Those who are familiar with the James Lee Burke books will likely get more out of it, but it fairs better than the other movie that was made from the series - Electric Mist - which was also a pretty good film.",1499299200,,267,4.056603773584905
7863495,4,6304166206,The DVD was excellent quality .  If you are a fan of James Lee Burke and Dave Robichaux you probably won't be disappointed .  While Alec Baldwin is not my favorite actor he did pick up some nuances that you would find in the book .  I have read or listen to many of James Lee Burke's Dave Robichaux novels but did not read or listen to this one prior to seeing the movie .  I'd say this is probably only for fans of James Lee Burke and Dave Robichaux although the movie could have stood on its own but probably would've been a little bit slow and most viewers would not quite get all of the nuances in this movie .  So this movie is based on understanding the characters and not based on the adaptation of the book since I have not read the book .,1499299200,,747,4.02027027027027
