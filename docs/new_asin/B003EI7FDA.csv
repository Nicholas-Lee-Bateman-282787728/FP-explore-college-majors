8395498,5,B003EI7FDA,Moe Norman's style of Natural Golf as interpreted by the Graves Golf Academy.  Very well done and easy to follow.  Helped my game by 10 - 15 strokes per round.  Especially helpful for the 'senior' golfer.,1412985600,,204,4.611111111111111

8395501,4,B003EI7FDA,"I have books, and this DVDs (more than 10 items) about Moe Norman's swing. This DVD is one of the item help to improve my swing, after one year of trial. I completely change my swing to this one. My best club is wood. It is dead straight. I have no one to help me, but DVDs and books about Moe Norman. My iron is still not quite good but is improving. I hope that there will be DVD about iron shot from Moe Norman, instead of Wood and Driver. Then my game will be perfect. Before change into Moe Norman swing, I shot around 100. And now is around low 90s. My best one is 87, 6 birdie chances contributed from my 3 and 5 woods.",1370563200,4,626,3.937007874015748
8395502,5,B003EI7FDA,"Having attended the Graves Golf Academy School, I must admit I am biased in writing this review. I also must state, that as a Board Certified  Orthopedic Surgeon I feel I am eminently qualified to critique the biomechanics of the golf swing.

Todd and Tim Graves teach the golf swing based on Moe Norman as the model. Moe is considered by many to have been the best ball striker who ever played the game. The Graves brothers explain why Moe was able to repeat his swing so consistently, and through drills developed by their vast teaching experience, show the golfer how they too can develop ""A Swing Like Moe"".

The video is superb, the narration simple and easy to understand, and the biomechanical principles correct and easy on the body to execute. No more back, elbow, or wrist pain if executed properly.

I would highly recommend this product to any golfer looking for a simpler, better, more consistent, and less body punishing golf swing. You won't be disappointed!",1277683200,26,973,4.773809523809524
