8617879,5,B00FPWWZTW,"Very nice and unique film. Good performance of Charlie Sheen. Lots of surprising cameos by famous actors/actresses. From the writer of Moonrise Kingdom, this film is a great treat for Sheen fans. For others it might seem a bit weird but it's definitely worth while seeing it at least once.
It has a nostalgic feeling and i really enjoyed it !",1427846400,,342,4.622950819672131
