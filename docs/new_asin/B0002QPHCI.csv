8030815,5,B0002QPHCI,"I loved this video! It's a moving, touching, often funny tribute to two of the greatest singers ever: David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks. It opens with a scene from David's funeral, but it is primarily upbeat. There are  interiews with David, Eddie and Dennis Edwards as well as Mary Wilson, Martha Reeves, Stevie Wonder, Daryl Hall and others. The June 1992 interviews with Eddie were especially touching because he had been diagnosed with lung cancer by then. In fact, he died four months later. It was sad to see him looking so frail. But he showed no signs of anger or bitterness. He exhibited the same elegeance, grace and style that he always had. I was really touched when he said that there's no point making the people around you sad. But overall, it was great fun to watch. He, David, Dennis, Mary Wilson and Martha Reeves seemed to have a genuine love and regard for each other. The street corner a capella harmonies with David, Eddie and Dennis are pure gold. Even though they must have sung those songs hundreds and hundreds of times, they seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves. One funny moment occurs when Eddie is standing outside by himself singing ""The Way You Do the Things You Do"" when a pigeon (obviously not impressed by Eddie) walks by and relieves himself. I guess the pigeon didn't know that he was in the presence of greatness. Scenes such as that and the backstage scenes make this video priceless. It features David, Eddie and Dennis's post-Temptation performances plus their performance with Hall and Oates at the Apollo. Another treat is the performances by the Dramatics singing the Tempts songs. These guys are great and have an obvious love and admiration for the Temptations. One highlight is when they sing ""Dream Come True"", a beautiful moving tribute to Eddie. The scene on the street where a fan asks Eddie for his autograph took me back to the night when my friend and I chased him down to get an autograph. He was just as gracious to her as he was to us years earlier. I can't say enough good things about this video. It's no longer available from Amazon, but I managed to find it on VHS at Street Gold Records.",1192492800,10,2149,4.640419947506562
8030816,5,B0002QPHCI,"I think it was nice how they celebrated the lives of Eddie and David and not made it seem like we should be mourning but celebrating their legacy! They left us with a lot of music and a lot of memories and we should remember them as they were when they were alive: happy and energetic! I loved the acapellas in the street corners! I thought they were a real treat! I like how they were teaching Arthell the steps to the songs and she was trying to get it! I also really enjoyed the interviews and just seeing them hang around and talk to each other! I loved Eddie's interview and how he said he and Paul were beating on Otis' group with their vocals! Haha. I also loved Dennis at the end and how he said that David was just David! And that he loved David and was good friends with both of them! I loved the friendship that they had! I loved how Eddie got stopped in the street and even though he was doing an interview he still stopped to sign an autograph for a fan! It just makes you feel like he did anything for his fans and that he was a very nice, humble, and generous man! I think the video was well put together! It gave you an appreciation for Eddie and David not just as entertainers but as people! It made you love what they did even more! I loved the way Eddie expressed himself! It was very insightful. Even though he might've been feeling ill at some time during the video you couldn't tell because Eddie just keep persevering like a true soldier! Some people said that Eddie was a closed person and didn't like people getting in his business but in this video it doesn't make you think that at all. It makes you love Eddie and David even more! It makes you go through so many emotions! You feel sad sometimes, happy sometimes and sometimes ecstatic and sometimes you can't believe what your eyes are seeing! I love how they added Backstage footage! That is really rare! I loved the entire thing! They did a great job on this! My only question is: Where's the one for PAUL  Lol. Man those tenors were amazing! This is truly a MUST-HAVE for any Temptations fan!",1160784000,13,2074,4.2639593908629445
