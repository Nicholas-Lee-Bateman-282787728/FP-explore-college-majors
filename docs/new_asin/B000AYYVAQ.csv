8081093,2,B000AYYVAQ,"Wow. Some striptease work in a bonus featurette and one full-frontal nude scene is the only thing that keeps this from being a one-star production as far as I'm concerned. I fast-forwarded through about half of it and barely paid attention to the other half. Definitely not what I was hoping for.

The three female leads in this movie, Culton included, are far past their primes. Actually I'm not sure that one of them ever had a prime. A fitting analogy might be to say that they're the best-looking women who live in the local trailer park. Culton's breasts look like they'd be great for use in a carnie's shell game.

Additionally, while this movie isn't supposed to be Oscar-worthy, it's a long way from being good even of this genre. I've seen a ton of movies like this, and some of them are intentionally funny and clever. This one tries to go there but fails at every turn. Remember that kid in your elementary-school class who thought that everything that he said and did was so cute and funny but really wasn't? He must have written the script for this.",1314403200,5,1062,4.554973821989528

What I beleive this review should focus on is the EXTRAS !
There are some amazing extras,First off this is a 2 DISC set and one whole dvd is for extras alone.
Their are multiple strip skits for LESLIE CULTON (Seen last summer at `Dragon Con `09' still plying her geek-adored wares).
JENNY WALLACE does a leather/cage/riding crop [...] piece and a Pole Dancing contest.
The hilight would be B-MOVIE THEATER ,a local tv show the `Scream Queens' hosted and this has whole episode devoted to `Giant Gila Monster',Including inserts by Leslie to liven up the B/W goings-on.
Almost forget the `NEW' Cover art by Trashfilmchristy, Its really cute(Almost ARCHIE-like) and more accurate than in the past renditions.
(What I said about VHS in 2005,Actually holds true for This DVD)...HOOKERS in a HAUNTED HOUSE . ...The video opens with a tribute to LADDER49 and a tip of the hat to ENTERPRISE fandom. Leslie Culton gets a chance to act & do comedy, Yes and her whole strip act. The script is very witty and tongue in cheek. One scene pays attention to the device of OUIJA board as a spiritual invitation for bad. HHH introduces a new serial killer ""BAG JOB"" a supermarket grocery bagger gone bi-polar. Paper or Plastic as killing instruments ? The couplings are interesting ; JENNY WALLACE has a nice shower scene with who might be TONYA HARDING ex-husband and LESLIE CULTON suffers thru mouth to breast resuscitation with either Wrestler CHRIS JERICHO older brother or GREG ""THE HAMMER"" VALENTINE son (I'm guessing, poetic license).",1253577600,2,1529,4.884615384615385
8081095,4,B000AYYVAQ,"Wildly unpredictable low budget horror spoof. Serious this movie is not! Busty blond bombshell Leslie Culton rocks in her first feature film. Red headed natural wonder Jenny Wallace shows her talents to the max. Highly recommended for anyone who is smart, a genre fan and has a sense of humor.",1106179200,8,293,4.88
8081096,1,B000AYYVAQ,"This is a very very low budget b flick. Would appear the star is very much in love with a new set of inplants. The star might be better off to go ahead with the 'Hardcore' films where what seems to be her only redeeming quality could be appreciated. No plot to get in the way of the story. Would say very bad acting, but I am not sure that is what they were trying to do. It's quite comical at certain points but unfortunatly those points are far and few between. Not a bad DVD if you can get it at a low enough price. If you can afford to waste a couple bucks, pick it up.",1078012800,15,573,3.864406779661017
