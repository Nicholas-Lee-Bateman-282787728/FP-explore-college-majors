8290951,5,B001D1ISRM,"I love this series and own five of the Yoga Live DVDs: two led by Jeffrey Cohen, two led by Elena Brower and one led by Sara Ivanhoe. Although all the instructors are great, Jeffrey's practices are my favorites in this series.

Jeffrey begins ""Core Strength for Abs"" by warming us up with nauli and side bends and then moves into a balance section (tip toes and tree) followed by sun salutations which build to include triangle, and reverse triangle into pyramid into warrior 3 with prayer hands. From there we move to the floor for a cat/cow series. Next is crow which is a real treat to find on a yoga DVD. That's what I like about Jeffrey's routines, he always throws some more challenging moves into the mix. From crow we move into a modified boat to warm us up for a full boat followed by bridge. Next is a modified head stand, after which we start to wind down with a seated spinal twist, seated forward bend, then tabletop into final relaxation.

The practice is about 40 to 45 minutes and, as with Jeffrey's other Yoga Live practice (""Energy Flow for Weight Loss""), I feel great when I'm through, not tired or overworked, but revitalized and refreshed. Jeffrey's instruction is calm and encouraging with a nice dose of good humor. For me, at least, his jokes have stood the test of time and frequent practice.

""Core Strength for Abs"" is an intermediate or advanced beginner routine. (It is definitely NOT for someone new to yoga.) As with all Yoga Live DVDs (at least the ones I own), modifications are shown by one of the instructors. It's an interesting set up because all three instructors are always present with one leading and one showing modifications and the other just following along. The instructors stand in front of a large group of yogis and yoginis of varying abilities/levels. The music is not your usual yoga soundtrack as producer Russell Simmons adds a bit of hip hop flavor to the mix. I don't find the music obtrusive or annoying (actually I like it) but that may be of concern to some.",1264723200,,2016,4.578947368421052
