8157217,4,B000KJTG1K,"I liked this film. I like French dramas like ""Pauline at the Beach""  too. They are simply soap operas I guess, but the French ones are more cerebral and thought provoking, this is exactly what I like the best. No rushing through scenes, letting it sink in for the viewer, no far out special effects, just raw drama. Close ups to show facial expressions and reactions. The story line was well paced",1468454400,,397,4.513888888888889

8157219,2,B000KJTG1K,It is evident i was expecting action that would be suspenseful but it did not really meet the action level expected based on the title,1395273600,,134,4.4
8157220,3,B000KJTG1K,"I saw it months ago.  My memory on this movie is weak.  The story is about a middle-age-man and a much younger girl.
It takes place in a river-side camp site.  Love at first sight?  Or lust?
The girl, unhappy with her parents' control, is always looking for warmer love and protection.  Love toward an older man.
This lonely man, however, has eyes on the free-spirited teen.  Lust is more than love.  In the end, he and the girl decide
to commit suicide together in a remote zone by the river.  The girl takes poison.  The man supposed to shot off his head,
changed his mind.  He dared not to kill himself.  He is criminally caught.

The whole love event is kind of parent's objection.  An affair is simply emotional.  No detailed vision about love.
Simply put, a wild and tragic romance.",1373328000,5,788,4.457746478873239
8157221,3,B000KJTG1K,"I gave this movie 3 stars only because the star, Isild le Besco, is so beautiful.  The movie itself is only okay and kinda boring at times.  I would still recommend it just to watch such a beautiful young actress.",1356652800,2,213,4.3
8157222,4,B000KJTG1K,Great French film. Young girl growing up and all it problems. Isled Le Besco is fascinating to watch.,1268265600,,101,4.666666666666667

mild porn this does not make it.",1235088000,5,94,4.277777777777778
8157224,3,B000KJTG1K,this is a (B) movie that is ok and it teaches you that you shouldn't mess with anyone when you are married or with a young in the mind person they can't handle the matters of the heart.,1191024000,2,185,3.8947368421052633
