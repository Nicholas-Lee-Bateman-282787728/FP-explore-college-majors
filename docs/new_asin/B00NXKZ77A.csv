8680952,5,B00NXKZ77A,"I bought this movie ""Best Friends"" after hearing other parents and grandparents RAVE about how cute it was and how much their children enjoyed it. Plus as an added bonus Best Friends included 3 BONUS movies that my family also enjoyed. I just ordered a few more for presents for some of my friends' children. You won't be disappointed with this adorable movie filled with over 60 animals-and who doesn't LOVE animals?",1434240000,,417,4.805555555555555
