8013219,5,B0001JUGJU,"""A Dolls House"" is a classic story for the ages. I have seen several versions and this version is good. The version with Claire Bloom and Anthony Hopkins in my estimation is the best one. I have to pretend that the main actress is not Jane Fonda and just pretend that she is the character in the story. It is too bad that Jane Fonda did not end up in prison for sedition.",1415750400,,371,4.095890410958904
8013220,3,B0001JUGJU,"The origional quality of the filming of this story is horrible.  There are plenty of movies out there that are older yet far better.  Also, the telling of the back story that doesn't exist in the play, but only become known to us through the dialogue is so much better.  Ibsen could write extremely well and his work does not need to be revised.",1290384000,,345,4.359375
8013221,3,B0001JUGJU,"This 1973 British and French adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's A DOLL'S HOUSE was released simultaneously with the Claire Bloom version, so it never played U.S. theaters but was shown on American television.

The picture opens with great promise-- an idyllic skating scene filmed in Rros, Sr Trndelag, Norway. Unfortunately, these few enchanting moments are the highlight of a rather disjointed story.

SYNOPSIS--
Nora (Jane Fonda) and Christine (Delphine Seyrig) part after a lovely day by a frozen lake. As Nora leaves, Nils Krogstad (Edward Fox) arrives; he begs Christine to marry him. She refuses, explaining that she must wed for money and security. Next, Dr. Rank (Trevor Howard) informs Nora that husband Torvald (David Warner) will die unless he convalesces for a year in Italy.

Suddenly it's six years later-- the Helmers have long since returned from warmer climes. Christine (now a widow) visits for Christmas week. After New Year's, Torvald, the newly appointed bank manager, intends to sack Nils and replace him with the woman who had spurned Nils so long ago, Christine. The uninvited Nils arrives at the Helmers' home and is rudely treated by Torvald, who then apologizes because it's Christmas. Nils speaks privately to Nora about an urgent matter.

Years earlier, when Nora was desperate for the cash necessary to take her sick husband to Italy, she borrowed it from Nils, never telling Torvald (a proud man) how the money was obtained. Now Nils threatens to inform Torvald of the long-standing IOU unless Nora can prevent Torvald from firing him. At wit's end, Nora contemplates suicide yet she gaily parties with her Christmas guests, Christine and Dr. Rank (who's just found out that he'll soon die from the syphillitic back he was born with).

Torvald reads the letter from Nils; he angrily berates Nora for compromising his authority at the bank. ""I'm ruined"" is the general tone. Nora hints of killing herself but soon after she tells Torvald that she doesn't love him and is leaving and she won't see her children before she goes.

If this attempted feminist statement hadn't been made with such heartless brutality and with no forewarning, it could have been an effective comeuppance for Torvald. Instead, the viewer is left feeling pity for him and disdain for a clearly uncaring Nora.

8013222,5,B0001JUGJU,"Filmed in 1973, this Joseph Losey-directed adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's play feels fragmented, its message sacrified to the lovely cinematography, stunning costumes, and then-controversial star.  In Ibsen's play, Nora gradually changes from being a brainless doll to a woman who realizes that she must leave her repressive husband and her children if she is ever to exist as a real person.  Jane Fonda, in this screen version, is manic and silly almost to the very end, her lack of gravitas making the conclusion more absurd than enlightening.
In both the play and this screen version, Nora is shallow and flirty at the outset, a woman who has married a wealthy man so that she can live a comfortable life.  Early in her marriage, she secretly borrows a large sum of money by forging her father's signature (so that she can take Torvald to Italy to cure an illness, in the film).  Now, unable to pay back the debt, threatened with blackmail, and fearful of Torvald's reaction if he finds out, Nora frantically considers suicide as the only way out.  When Torvald discovers her deception, he does forgive her, but Nora cannot forgive him for his attitudes, and she leaves to seek her own identity.
For nearly the entire film, Jane Fonda, as Nora, flirts, leaps around, and appears to have no ties to reality, interested only in spending money that Torvald says he does not have.  When she eventually speaks of suicide, it is not even clear that she is talking about suicide, rather than just going away.  Her decision to leave and presumably support herself is inconsistent with the character as Fonda has played her.  David Warner as Torvald is stultifyingly dull, and Trevor Howard, as Dr. Rank, is wasted in the role, seeming more like Nora's grandfather than a secret admirer.
Filmed on location in Norway in the winter, the setting is gorgeous, with lush and authentically reproduced interiors and snow-covered exteriors, featuring skating, horse-drawn sleighs, and period architecture.  The costumes by Edith Head are stunning, and the music by Michel LeGrand is romantic.  It is the casting that does not work here, lacking the tension that makes drama effective.  In the greatest of ironies, the liberated Jane Fonda, as the liberation-seeking Nora, is ultimately unbelievable in the role.  Mary Whipple",1089331200,7,2310,5.002610966057441
8013223,3,B0001JUGJU,"This movie was disapointing after reading the play. i felt the play had a lot more depth and the movie just didn't explore all of this. stick with the book. although the movie has some good points, i found the book to be much more entertainting.",980380800,3,245,4.3478260869565215
