8599514,4,B00DZQUJK2,"The style of this documentary is dictated by the ailing nature of Barshai who died very shortly after the series of interviews had been recorded. In effect Barshai is allowed to reminisce over the historically significant events of his life in the order that his memories occur to him. This gives the film its basic character which tends to ramble without much shape.

However, Barshai's life unfolded during the Stalin period and beyond and encompassed all sorts of privations and restrictions that were imposed upon Jewish people within Russia throughout that time. These controls even extended to state pressure put upon him when out of Russia. These events had damaging effects upon relationships within his private life and, although not delving very deeply, the musical restrictions upon his life are made clear enough.

The two musical achievements that he valued above all else were his completion of both Bach's unfinished Art of Fugue and also Mahler's unfinished 10th symphony. These two tasks occupied him for many years but were both accomplished to his satisfaction. The film dwells on these two driving forces and the film's title is a reference to the single note in Mahler's original score that opened the way to his completion of the score.

Another driving force was his creation of the Moscow Chamber Orchestra which achieved world-wide acclaim. This was a group of musicians that had been individually coached by Barshai and was created on the basis of its members being made up of chamber and solo players. This was not the same as a reduced symphony orchestra in concept.  His final departure from Russia meant that this close musical link was severed for ever.

Barshai also made arrangements for chamber orchestra of two of Shostakovich's string quartets, arrangements that had the approval of the composer with whom Barshai had worked as a duo team for many years. That particular duo relationship is not touched on during the film.

The film maker has done very well in his attempt to introduce variety from such a static subject and venue. This variety includes archive material and shots of manuscript detail as well as the surrounding countryside. The film concludes with Barshai's funeral.

This is an interesting film which charts the lifetime experiences of an important Russian musician working under considerable difficulty and restraints. As such it is an important historical account of those times. It is a pity that the film was not made a few years earlier with more sense of direction. Nevertheless we must be content with what we have rather than what we might have had.

Given those considerations and the limited circumstances open to the film-maker, this is has ended up as an interesting but inevitably flawed product. There is enough in it however to provide enough to be of interest to those interested in that period of musical and social history.",1392163200,2,2896,5.031315240083507
8599515,3,B00DZQUJK2,"NOTE was filmed quickly not long before Barshai's death.  It is an important document that works well for about 55-60 minutes (of 90 total).  During that time, the filmmaker lets Barshai ramble, providing stories that are near to his heart (with musical inserts and images that enhance topic or mood).  While it can be a bit difficult to follow Barshai as he jumps back and forth across years, the disjointed presentation provides an arresting take on what life was like for Barshai (and Shosti and others) during the terrible Soviet Union years - the constant sense of disorientation from pervasive fear and surprise.  (And in light of Putin's latest witch hunt, it could not be more timely).  As a result of the film's style and content, one starts to even wonder if some of the inspiration and beauty that resulted was perhaps due to the harsh conditions in which Barshai lived, not in spite of them (perseverance and sacrifice are themes explored in his own life as well as in the life of Beethoven and Richter).  But after 55 min or so, the very impressionistic take becomes a hindrance to fully appreciating this film.  Barshai starts talking about wives and kids and one cannot tell up from down.  The hands-off approach taken by the filmmaker goes from endearing and insightful, to misguided and neglectful.  Liner notes are meager and could have helped the viewer to better understand the history of Mahler's Tenth and Barshai's place in it.  Wikipedia offers an entry on this, though I cannot verify all the material there.",1387238400,,1533,4.839080459770115
