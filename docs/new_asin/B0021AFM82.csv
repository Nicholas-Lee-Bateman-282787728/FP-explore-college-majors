8348869,4,B0021AFM82,"This is a great movie pack, and the price was really good as well.  Donnie Darko was a great movie. I had never seen it up until about 2 years ago and thought WOW this is a great movie.  I would say it is Jake Gyllenhaal's best performance Ive seen (I never did see Brokeback Mountain).  Boondock Saints was a great movie as well.  Willem Dafoe has a great role.  And of course the classic Edward Scissorhands.",1262822400,,410,4.2727272727272725
