5049036,5,B0071U3MRA,"All I can say is WOW! For anyone who is a fan of Frank Sinatra, his movies or his music, this DVD set is amazing and you will be hard pressed to find anything as complete as this. On top of this the quality of the recordings were high grade and you get to see Sinatra at his best and of course you get to hear him sing in some of them as well. There is a great book that comes with the set as well that has some great images on it too which again shows Sinatra in the prime of his life. This was an amazing DVD set that I would highly recommend for anyone who was or is a fan of Sinatra, you will not be disappointed!",1335484800,26,617,3.753846153846154

Each of the10 dvd's has its own slot in one of the two folding cardboard cases which then slide into a single 'outer' case that takes the shelf space of TWO dvd's. I just wish they had included ""Come Blow Your Horn""  instead of ""Cast a Giant Shadow"" - which is really a Kirk Douglas movie with a Sinatra cameo appearance (check the imdb.com cast list). If you are a Frank-Fan, and you have less than four of these movies in your collection, you should consider adding this set.",1439769600,3,497,4.4021739130434785

5049058,4,B0071U3MRA,"Excellent films and excellent transfers, but the actual disk manufacturing leaves a lot to be desired.  Most of the discs are either out of balance or have a center hole too large.  Two would not play on my blu-ray, but could be played on my laptop.  One had problems on my blu-ray and was considered a blank disk by my laptop.  All rattled while being played.

These 3 films are (1) Kings Go Forth (4x3 pan-and-scan; the OAR is 1.85:1), (2) The Pride and the Passion (4x3 letter-boxed; the OAR is 1.85:1), and (3) A Hole in the Head (4x3 letter-boxed; the OAR is 2.35:1).

5049081,5,B0071U3MRA,"Fox has yet put out another great Film Collection of another excellent actor. Five films are MGM's and the other five are Fox's in which Fox is the distributor for most if not all MGM films.

5049085,3,B0071U3MRA,"I know it's a bit churlish to complain about 10 discs for $20, the current CostCo price, but I will anyway because it's another example of Fox's deceitful marketing practices. They, almost alone among DVD releasers, avoid specifying the quality level of their discs. This set contains some fine films, but they are a mix of (appropriately) fullscreen, non-anamorphic widescreen, and anamorphic widescreen. This won't matter if you watch movies on your phone, but, the bigger your display, the more crucial it becomes. Some of the films, like Can-Can, are anamorphic, and a bargain at this price. But some, like The Pride and the Passion, a near-epic, are not only non-anamorphic, but 2.4:1 to boot, meaning that the actual bit-rate used to create the picture is about a third of what you would normally expect. A Hole in the Head is another in this category. Cast A Giant Shadow, Tony Rome, The Detective, and Lady in Cement are anamorphic. I haven't watched the others yet.",1358640000,20,974,4.909090909090909
5049086,5,B0071U3MRA,What a great find this one was I've been slowly picking up some of Frank's movies as I came acrross them I have most of the rat pack ones but then I saw this. This is a great collection of Frank's movies a total of ten movies covering all areas of his acting from some of the musicals to the dramas then three of the delightful Tony Rome movies forget all those TV guys these are great. Not only was Frank one of the greatest singers of all time but he was a great actor with a wonderful body of work many right here in this collection . Starting your and this guy can act collection? This is a good start some down right wonderful movies. You just can't do wrong with this one.,1357862400,10,678,4.067164179104478
5049087,5,B0071U3MRA,I mainly got this set for the Tony Rome movies. But this collection gives you wide range of Sinatra movies. From wonderful comedies like a Hole in the Head to powerful dramatic roles like the Manchurian Candidate. Musicals like the Can-Can and war movies like Von Ryan's Express and detective moves like Tony Rome. If you want a set of Sinatra movies that gives you an overview of his talents this is a good set to have. 10 great movies at a great price. Nice package and a great price and Sinatra in some of his most diverse roles.,1357171200,40,532,4.383838383838384

I would have liked to see the end of the movies that I didn't know Sinatra made. I liked the diversity. There was Frank as a cowboy, a detective, a Spanish revolutionary and more. Frank really had range. What I could watch was very different and entertaining. Frank had good movies with other big name movie stars like Sophia Loren and John Wayne.
This would have been a prized collection if it didn't lock up my DVD player. I don't recommend buying this box set. If you want to make sure you get to see the whole movie, buy the titles individually.",1524700800,,725,4.148936170212766
