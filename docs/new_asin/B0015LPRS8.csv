8259051,5,B0015LPRS8,Great rendition of a willful young women living in England during the 19th century...Emily Watson is great!! This is a Masterpiece Theater Production!,1461715200,,150,5.565217391304348
8259052,5,B0015LPRS8,Read this book many years ago and it was great seeing the characters come to life. I highly recommend this DVD,1372636800,,110,4.285714285714286
8259053,5,B0015LPRS8,"The Mill on the Floss is a good movie, definitely worth purchasing.  It will hold your interest from start to finish.  But, as usual, the characters way of thinking and their behavior will have you chewing nails.  Again, 5 stars.",1365811200,,229,4.675
8259054,3,B0015LPRS8,"I have not yet read this book so cannot say if they left a lot out or changed things.  At any rate, the cast does a nice job with their roles. The story mainly concerns a proud father who loses the mill that belonged to his family, but is also about his son and daughter and the conflicts they have with two other fellows who enter their lives at different points.

I am still mystified at the way it ends.",1362355200,,406,4.0625
8259055,5,B0015LPRS8,"A longstanding dispute over water rights infects a family with disastrous results. Don't want to give too much away in this review but suffice to say Emily Watson's heartbreaking portrayal of the loving sister and daughter brings one to tears.
Although only movie length, this version of Mill On the Floss tells the story as well as any. Should be in every Classics collection.",1347753600,3,377,4.90625
8259056,5,B0015LPRS8,"If you are a fan of George Eliot or just the classics, then you should love this. Emily Watson and James Frain are great in this. Worth checking out!",1344643200,,149,4.172413793103448
8259057,3,B0015LPRS8,"George Eliot's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mill-on-the-Floss-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141439629/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mill on the Floss (Penguin Classics)</a>&nbsp;is one of my favorite books, and after seeing the low overall rating for this movie, I was a bit hesitant as to whether or not I wanted to watch it. But since I love the story I figured I would give it a try. I'm not yet sure of whether or not I made the right decision.

All of the actors in the movie were fine. I love James Frain in the Tudors, so I was really excited to see him play my favorite character from the book, Philip Wakem. While he did a good job in the scenes he was in, his character did not make a big impression on me. I had found him much more interesting than either Tom or Stephen, but I guess that whoever made this movie thought differently.

I was a bit concerned before watching this about the length: it's only about an hour and a half, and most good mini-series are three or four hours long. However, the short length was really no problem. They were able to include all of the important scenes without the entire film seeming rushed.

(Major spoilers-only read if you know the story) The filmmakers did not do a great job with the ending. While I absolutely love the novel, I've always felt a little bit uncomfortable with the ending. I think that Eliot just wanted to have a beautiful, tragic ending where both Maggie and Tom died together, but when she came to the end of the book, she couldn't real think of what to do, so she just ended up creating an unlikely, facile scene where they died together. Having the city suddenly flood just didn't seem to tie in too well with the rest of the story. I love tragic stories where the main characters die in the end, so I had nothing wrong with Maggie and Tom dying, I just was not impressed with the manner in which they did so. While the filmmakers did the typical things to make the ending beautiful, something about it seemed kind of corny to me.

The movie overall was entertaining, but it exposed how weak the ending of this wonderful story really is. Usually when I get through watching a mini-series or movie on one of my favorite books, I feel inspired to reread it. However, I felt sort of embarrassed to consider this one of my favorite stories after watching it. So, watch this at your own risk.",1265414400,3,2410,4.67688679245283
8259058,1,B0015LPRS8,"I just don't know what to say. I haven't read the book, and now I really really don't want to. My main issue is that the cover and description are very misleading. I like some of Masterpiece Theater's interpretations of classic literature, but I gotta say, DON'T WATCH THIS! Just to be sure, I'm going to pass along a spoiler:

So she's all like: ""I can't be happy. I want to be in love with you, but I can't because my brother will hate me."" And then her bedroom floods, and there's this convenient little picturesque canoe outside her window. So she goes and says to her brother: ""Join me in my canoe, and forgive my foolishness,"" and he replies: ""All right."" So then he tries to get in the canoe, but he misses it completely, and drowns instead. Apparently when someone doesn't know how to swim, they can drown, but it still doesn't stop them from trying to rescue other drowning people. So she drowns too.

The end.

Didn't expect THAT when you read the back cover, did ya?",1233878400,8,977,4.416666666666667
8259059,3,B0015LPRS8,I thought this one was very depressing.  Did not leave me feeling good about any part of it.  I know it is considered a classic but I would not want to watch it again.,1217808000,2,167,3.8823529411764706
