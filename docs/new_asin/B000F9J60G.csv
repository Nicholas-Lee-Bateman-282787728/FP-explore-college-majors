8541344,5,B000F9J60G,"I just received my purchase of this dvd last week. I was definately not disappointed. My family and I stayed up all Saturday night watching the games, the highlights, and all the extra stuff. This dvd is perfect for the true gator lover, it comes with plenty of bonus features (like a section on the little known Bradley team), Full length coverage of all the Final Four games, and condensed coverage of the entire tournament. This is not to be missed. The only point of contention for me was the interviews. The dvd claimed to have interviews with Billy Donovan, Joakim Noah, and Lee Humphrey. While there were interviews with all three, they were heavily edited and dispersed throughout the Tournament Recap portion only. That was my only problem and it is certainly not big enough to take anything away from what is an awesome comprehensive compilation of the gator boys electrifying season!",1200268800,2,894,4.849673202614379
