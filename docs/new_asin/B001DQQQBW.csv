8294557,3,B001DQQQBW,"Another Hollywood play on ""The Last Of The Mohicans"" but with a few switch arounds.  No Chingachgook and a added brother Davy to the two daughters of Col. Munro.  No romance between Uncas and Alice Munro (Evelyn Akers), but Hawkeye (Michael O'Shea) seems taken with her.  No romance with Cora Munro (Julie Bishop) and Hawkeye, but she appears taken with Maj. Heyward (Jon Hall) there is no real romance there either.  A good villain role as Magua for Buster Crabbe (Tarzan, Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers and Billy The Kid Movies).  The storyline had evil Magua leading the Munro family and Maj. Heyward into a trap, but rescued by Hawkeye and Uncas.  It follows their attempt to get back to their father Col. Munro and being pursued by Magua and the Iroquois warriors.  Average flick for western fans and Jon Hall fans.
Humorous scene had Jon Hall with a saber in his hand out swim Olympic Gold Medal winning swimmer Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe.  Also some of the settings appear in mountainous rocky ranges instead of forests and there are so many horses that I didn't know the Iroquois were great horseback riding warriors.  Hollywood, you gotta love ""em.",1429574400,,1147,4.781725888324873
8294558,2,B001DQQQBW,"In responce to the information given in the Editorial Review of The Last Of The Redmen.

The character Cora, (Julie Bishop) does not  enter into an ill-fated relationship with the character Magua (Buster Crabbe), she enters into a relationship with the character Uncas (Ric Vallin).

Michael O Shea, plays the part of Hawkeye, and not Major Howard.

Jon Hall, plays the part of Major Howard, and is not the least bit odious.

But, as in most versions of the novel, The Last Of The Mohicans, some of the characters from the novel do not appear in the adaptations.

In this version, a child character Davy (Buzz Henry), appears, if any character in the film is odious, it is surely this one, and he`s not mentioned in the novel.

The character Chingasgook, Uncas`s father, who is one of the main characters in the novel, and other versions of this book, does not even appear in this movie.

I think whoever reviewed this movie, should have watched it more closely, and at least got their facts correct.",1229126400,,1000,4.674285714285714
