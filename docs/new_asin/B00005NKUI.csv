1635127,5,B00005NKUI,"The original Wishmaster was cool for what it was...when Wishmaster 2 came out, the first one looked like a masterpiece!  When I first read about part 3, I was hesitant about seeing it.  But last night I was bored and rented it and was shocked at how good it really was!
A pleasant diversion from the first two movies, this Wishmaster takes place at a college campus, features lots of cool wishes/killings, great special effects for a direct-to-video movie, and many surprising and exciting plot twists.  The main character's second wish was such an out-of-nowhere surprise, I was just floored, and so was the Djinn!
Great movie, great effects...that equals a great time!  Buy this movie!",1014508800,3,687,4.896551724137931
1635128,2,B00005NKUI,"This was a good horror flick but a terrible Wishmaster. The Djinn gets physical instead of mental. Seems like the Director made this film for younger audiences ( set on a college campus ) A true Wishmaster fan would't mind if it was an insurance siminar! Plus there were two guys playing the Djinn! Bottom line, PAY ANDREW DIVOFF WHAT HE WANTS AND BRING THE REAL DJINN BACK!!!! This movie without Divoff is like watching Psycho without Norman Bates! Don't buy it.

I thought the special effects were pretty good,but the movie is not very scary at all and the genie makeup is pretty bad. I would reccomend that you rent it beforing buying it because some people may not enjoy it as much as i did. Rated R for strong violence,language,and nudity",1012608000,6,415,4.402597402597403
1635130,1,B00005NKUI,"This was THE worst movie I have ever seen.  I love Wishmaster 1&2 but this was horrible!  It didn't even have Andrew Divoff (the djinn) in the movie.  It didn't follow the Wishmaster rules.  Like he would force people to make wishes rather than trick them into selling their soul.  After the movie I was so depressed that I had spent any money on that movie, that I burned the movie in a burn barrel rather than ever even look at that movie again!
Take my advise, if you MUST see it, RENT IT.  FOR GOD SAKE DON'T BUY IT!",1010966400,13,520,4.15

1635132,2,B00005NKUI,"This movies lacks in many areas.  First, it lacks seriously in creativity.  It starts out with a young college student suffering from nightmares and trying to deal with a tragic accident that happened when she was young.  From there she finds the hidden gem and unleashes the Djinn.  Second, the Djinn that they have in this movie does not come close to the Djinn from the previous 2 movies.  Also, this Djinn only shows up in true form only a few times in the movie.  They probably shot all of the Djinn scenes over a few day period to save money on makeup costs.  Some of the death scenes are somewhat entertaining, but they could have thought them out a little more.  The movie could have been made with a little more effort and probably would have had better results.  Hopefully they can correct their errors on Wishmaster 4, which I heard that they are making.",1005782400,2,865,4.493589743589744
1635133,1,B00005NKUI,"Don't take that 1 star rating lightly. This is my first 1-star review. The first Wishmaster was great, the second was fair, and the third was awful.
Andrew Divoff, the incredible actor who played the Djinn and his human alter ego, Demerest, in the first two films has been replaced by an utterly dreadful actor who plays the part as if he's in a kiddie's production of ""The Ghost of Canterville Hall."" As for the human alter ego, a professor at a University, he is far too physical for the part. The Djinn is supposed to attack mentally with the mind, not throwing people at walls.
The story of this film concerns a college student named Diana Collins who unwittingly awakes the Djinn when looking over an ancient artifact. The Djinn kills a perverse college professor and takes on his identity to get to Diana. He then goes around the university, picking off students one by one on his quest for Diana. Sounds entertaining? It's not. The twisted wishes have none of the ghoulish irony that the original's wishes had and are no fun at all. I mean, c'mon! Think about how much material you have here! A thousand-year-old genie at a modern day university? What's happening to our screenwriters?
I wasted 5 bucks and 90 minutes of my life when I rented this movie, and I think the morons who threw together this awful movie should give me a refund!",1005523200,14,1345,4.5850622406639

It's unclear if this Jinn is the same one in the first 2.  This one was trapped in a Fire Opal, same the first 2.  But it was hidden in a different place, and this Fire Opal didn't need to be charged with human souls.  This Jinn just needed to grant his waker 3 wishes to destroy the world.

Dianna woke the Jinn.  He killed several of the people in her life before he came for her.  Using her friends and those she loved against her.  Her first wish was twisted into the death of one of them.  Her second was to summon the Archangel Michael, to help stop the Jinn.

Michael possessed her boyfriend, taking human form, but bringing the Sword of Angels with him.  In the hands of the Waker, that Sword could actually kill a Jinn.  Michael kept Dianna alive and safe, until she became worthy of the Sword.  The climax was Dianna running the Jinn threw and saving the world.",1454198400,,928,4.234285714285714

1635153,3,B00005NKUI,"WISHMASTER 3
I Guess because wishmaster 2 was so successful
that the Producers thought they could make another sequel
which turned out to be very average in my opinion, this 3rd sequel went direct to Video
it didn't even spend time at the cinemas which does not surprise me

after 30mins into the film i got bit bored with it
first of all the Djinn is now played by another Actor John Novak which he had a different way to play the Djinn
Different to Andrew Divoff's version that's for sure
Andrew Divoff's performance is amazing, so i didn't like John Novak's version much
it's anybody's guess why Andrew Divoff did not return as the Djinn
maybe he didn't like the script
it's like saying no other actor can play Freddy krueger like Robert Englund
it's the same here with the Djinn character
but it's a matter of opinion really
the written screenplay is very average and so is the Directing
this film is one of A.J. cook's first films, A.J. cook plays Agent Jareau in criminal minds

this DVD release released back in 2001 has both fullscreen & widescreen options
there's also an Audio commentary by Director and some of the cast from the film aswell
plus some behind the scenes footage

i'm a big fan of the first 2 films, this 3rd sequel is just tolerable to watch
i gave it 3 stars cause it's okay, the Acting, the script, the Directing is very average",1415318400,,1356,4.481781376518219
1635154,3,B00005NKUI,"Most of the reviews on here have said it and mine will be no different. But first to start things off; Wishmaster 3 was third installment of the 4 part Wishmaster series. Taking place 2 years after Wishmaster 2, in a new millennium, I guess the producers decided it was time to mix things up...and not for the better. For whatever strange reason the great Andrew Divoff was absent from this film and Jason Connery/John Novak replaced him as the evil Djinn.

Wishmaster 3 revolves around our main character, Diana Collins, a beautiful college student who's consistently being plagued with visions of her parents' death that came about from a fiery car crash that happened when she was a little girl. Meanwhile, after presenting an impressive lecture on Achilles in class; Diana's history professor, Joel Barash, invites her to meet him at the University's museum later that night to study a few artifacts with him. Once Diana arrives, she accidentally unveils the fire red opal that contains the Djinn that was confined within a box that was packaged and meant for Barash. Once Barash arrives, he's impressed with Diana's finding of the opal as well as some inscriptions that she also uncovered and invites her to celebrate with him so he can get to know her a bit better; slightly hinting to her that he has feelings for her. Diana kindly declines and leaves the museum, where the Djinn promptly shows up shortly after.

The Djinn demands that Barash reveals Diana's whereabouts but when he refuses, the Djinn threatens him into wishing for love, knowing that he's lonely and yearns for female compassion. Barash goes on to wish for 2 of the most beautiful women to be in love with him. The Djinn grants his wish but the 2 women eventually kill Barash and the Djinn goes on to take Barash's face to convert himself to human form. From there, Wishmaster goes on a murderous rampage across the campus, tracking down Diana and granting deadly wishes to everyone that crosses his path. With her back against the wall, Diana uses one of her wishes to wish for the archangel, Michael to assist her in defeating the Djinn. With help from her boyfriend, Greg and from a higher power, Diana must build the courage to use the sword of Heaven to slay the bloodlust Djinn or allow the Djinn to unleash the multitudes of his demonic counterparts into the world

Overall: Unfortunately, Wishmaster 3 is where the Wishmaster series begins to take a dip. Many fans of the Wishmaster series like to give this movie negatives simply for the fact that Andrew Divoff, who gave classic performances as the Djinn in Wishmasters 1 and 2 was absent. In my opinion, that's good enough! But just to give you an idea on how they completely screwed up the Wishmaster image, they broke 2 rules that the first 2 Wishmaster films followed. First; the Djinn can be killed in this movie. In the first 2, the Djinn was always immortal and could never be killed. Apparently that's no longer the case. The second is that the Djinn gets violent with people. The Djinn could never put his hands on anyone that was alive. Yet in this one, he's seen beating people up and throwing them around like neighborhood garbage. It makes no sense to stray away from the movie's original logic. Sean Connery offers up a decent performance as the Djinn (John Novak voices the actual Wishmaster though) but it pales in comparison to the amazing role that Divoff gave. Divoff took the role and made it his own and really made the Wishmaster seem sadistic. Connery just doesn't do a good job at making a believer out of me. Plus what I also hated is that Wishmaster 3 fell in line as a teen/college teen slasher sort of flick. As if there weren't enough of those in the 80s and 90s, the writers felt the need to be unoriginal and center this around college students getting killed off by an evil monster. It was 2001 for crying out loud! Because of that Wishmaster 3 doesn't come off as all that enjoyable. Wishmaster 3 does succeed in one thing though; gore. This edition of the film had probably some of the most goriest kill scenes out of all 4 films. How does the sound of a girl literally vomiting her guts out sound? I don't recommend eating when watching that scene. Despite Divoff's absence, had the writers taken time to make the movie plot seem just a little bit original and fall in line with the theme of the movie, Wishmaster 3 could've been a fairly good film. Instead it flops and comes off as mediocre that didn't do its homework in keeping with the original basis of the 2 films with a bland and rather worn out cliche plot. Overall, Wishmaster 3 marks the beginning of the end for the Wishmaster series and depending on how well you like cheesy, bad, cliche horror movies will depend on whether or not you like Wishmaster 3",1414022400,,4787,4.616197183098592
1635155,1,B00005NKUI,In this installment of Wishmaster they replace Andrew Divoff (the Djinn) not sure why but the movie is worse for that error. The movie moves incredibly slowly and the lack of Divoff leaves the Djinn character boring and underwhelming. I only made it 3/4 of the way through. I had to shut it off.,1411344000,,295,4.481481481481482

1635161,3,B00005NKUI,"All the gore and dumb plot but not of the Divoff's canny evil cheeky charm of the previous release.  A noticeable drop in quality for the franchise, but at least the effects are still fun and cheesy.  Wishmaster (1997) and Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies (1999) are both much better, largely for Andrew Divoff's ability to appear credibly pleased with his Djinn's evil.

First off, bad news guys.  Andrew Divoff (Wishmaster, Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies) will not be returning to play the Monkey paw, wish-twisting Djinn.  If you loved his performance in parts one and two, then maybe this movie isn't for you.

After an opening montage of museum relics including something akin to Pinhead's Hellraiser puzzlebox, the camera settles on a nightmare-plagued, semi-attractive college girl (A.J. Cook).  Diana, having agreed to help her classics/mythology professor with some Iranian exhibit at a museum, snoops around and discovers the foreboding puzzlebox-looking artifact.  I'll give you all one guess at what's inside?  BINGO!  A giant blood ruby!  As if it made perfect sense to do this, she immediately rubs this ruby (which was already clean and sparkling) with a rag.  Aaaaaaaaand GENIE!  But just like the previous two movies, the genie never seems to arrive until after the ruby-rubber departs, leaving the genie with the need to find them.

This box and ruby was shipped to her mythology professor who says the Iranian trinket is inscribed in Aramaic.  So he teaches classic mythology, studies Iranian relics and reads Aramaic?  Smart guy.  I get that some academics have weird combinations of interests, but this is up there with Christopher Lloyd in Piranha 3D (2010) being a fish store owner who is an expert in piranha biology (so he's into ichthyology), extinct piranhas and their fossils (a dash of paleontology; not too farfetched yet though), and the local subterranean bodies of water (yup, cave lakes) in a region with no piranha species (and now it's ridiculous that he has a fish store there).  Oh, and he owns a piranha fossil.  Doesn't that thing belong in a museum, bro?

Anyway, the genie arrives and two things are very different about this movie compared to its predecessors.  One, there is no highly memorable, uber-gory opening in which the genie must eat a soul to become fully constituted into the tentacle-headed monster we've come to love.  And two, Andrew Divoff's iconic evil voice has been replaced with some synthesizer-enhanced voice.  It's not good.  Worse yet, the franchise's budget clearly took yet another hit, leaving the Djinn's skin looking as rubbery as ever.  And what's with the goofy over-sized ears?

Amazon's editorial review claims this is ""the goriest installment of the hit franchise yet.""  That's a blatant lie to sell DVDs, people!  You'll find more truth in the Djinn's granted wishes!  This is no more gory than previous installmentswhich is sufficiently, playfully gory.  I'd say it's the least gory, but not by a lot.  The gore seems to drop with each subsequent sequel (and budget cut).

It's far beyond the stabs and blood in a typical slasher movie.  Gross, gory scenes include ""forced"" magical liposuction-to-death and gutsy limb regeneration.  Overall, the gore is a little less than part 2 (and way less than part 1) but the effects team made a decent effort with what they had.  The classic Wishmaster ""face peel"" looks a bit lame in this movie and his genie magic is still depicted as cheaply-CGI'd blue electricity.

The real downfall in this third installment--other than an actor who couldn't fill Divoff's shoes--was the Djinn's appearance.  If you think I'm being critical take another look at the Djinn's make-up and prosthetics paint job.  Like so many other lower budget horror movies, this sequel relies on nudity to fill the voidnot that it needed it to be entertaining.  I guess starving actress' breasts are cheaper than rubber guts these days.

The most totally random thing that happens is when, by Diana's wish, her boyfriend Greg (Tobias Mehler; Disturbing Behavior, Carrie [2002]) gets transformed into an archangel (i.e., Greg now has blue eyes and a sword) for a painfully bad fight complete with Djinn-flipping, pew-throwing nonsense.  This fight is about as bad as the story (which was admittedly about as bad in part 2) and the genie's attempt at evil humor (which was actually loads of fun in part 2--did I mention how much I miss Andrew Divoff?).

The twisted wishes are as lame as ever, there gore well doesn't flow as abundantly, and Andrew Divoff's replacement offers none of the fun personality that fueled the success of the first two installments.  So, why watch this one?  Honestly, despite the stupid story it's not bad for a ""fun"" 2001 horror and it's rather decent considering its budgetary constraints.  The effects are largely biased towards the second half, but once you arrive there they make for an entertaining ride.",1397865600,,4922,5.0147965474722564

1635163,4,B00005NKUI,Unusual movie series - make wishes but be careful what you wish for.  This particular movie had one of my favorite actresses in it A.J. Cook (currently in Criminal Minds).  I watch syfy movies on Amazon streaming at night to help me get to sleep but unfortunately the Wishmaster movies keep me awake.  But that's OK.  Not too gory but quite entertaining if you are a syfy buff like me.  I would recommend to all syfy enthusiasts.,1395964800,,429,4.51948051948052
1635164,1,B00005NKUI,"Look, no one is saying ""Wishmaster"" is among the great horror series, but it has some fun moments, and I count myself as a fan. I enjoyed Wishmaster, and loved Wishmaster 2. I was excited to see Wishmaster 3, though naturally I expected some dropping off in quality. (Yeah I know. I am probably way too tolerant of cheap direct-to-video horror flicks.)

Unfortunately, Wishmaster 3 doesn't even follow the admittedly vague Wishmaster rules. People make wishes, but then the Wishmaster basically just kills them. Example: a guy wishes for two hot girls to be in love with him - they turn up, kiss him, then kill him. How does that fulfill his wish? Heck, I can think of ten ways in which having two hot girls who love you can be transformed into something horrible and murderous - but the writers of Wishmaster 3 couldn't. Pfui.

The villain is not ominous at all. I miss the guy from Wishmaster 2 - man he could ROCK a creepy grin.

The whole show is crippled by an idiot subplot in which the girl heroine can't bring herself to say ""I love you"" to her boyfriend. Even though she sleeps with the guy, she is tagged as having ""intimacy issues"". Really? The only bright point in the whole film is that when it's over and the evil djinn returned to his gem, all the people he killed aren't magically resurrected. Man I HATED that in the other films. Sadly it's not enough to make up for the suckitude otherwise.

1635167,1,B00005NKUI,"For me the Wishmaster story/series wasn't as good or well crafted as the Hellraiser or Prophecy series or others.
The first two installments were so much better than the last two of this series from every aspect. In the third and fourth editions the production values take a huge dip so much so they look more like a daytime soap than movies. The soaps have better acting and even their storylines are better written than these last two movies.
Not having Divoff playing the Djinn is like Peter Pan playing Santa and come to think of it the costume looked more like Peter Pan's. Ok, that's a little harsh, but I didn't even remember that I had watched this before until 5 minutes in when I realized I snoozed through this movie before.
The movies upside is its attractive cast including ""the girl next door"" A.J.Cook and for those looking for nudity it has a few of those scenes. The CGI and special effects makeup are pretty lame as is the fight and kill scenes. There is a fair amount of four letter words tossed about including the big F word, but is still tame for the genre.

While watching this film the viewer is constantly thinking about the wishes that the wishmaster gives to those unfortunate souls. The special effects were awesome and the pace of the film goes very smoothly. The wishmaster character was super evil and quite scary. There is excitement every minute of the film and some very scary scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. Was hoping that there would have been more intimate scenes between diana and greg that would have spiced the film up a little. i plan on adding this film to my collection, and think that this movie would be liked by young couples watching tv at home.

1635172,4,B00005NKUI,"In the third installment of the Wishmaster series a beautiful college student named Diana Collins (A.J. Cook) releases the evil djinn from a mystical Persian case. The djinn first appears to a lonely college professor Joel Barash (Jason Connery) and grants him a wish which is to be loved by the two most beautiful women in the world. The two beauties turn into demon women who slash and cut the professor to death. The djinn kills the professor and steals his identity and takes over his job as the teacher. In the class the djinn as the professor tells the class that the ancient Greeks worshipped the Djinn through their mythological gods. In another scene a beautiful brunette who is attracted to the professor`s new charisma, charms and powerful personality and says to him that he strikes her as a man that can break a girls heart. The djinn in the professor`s form tells her ""you wish me to break your heart"". She says ""oh yes"" and her heart explodes and she falls on the ground dead with blood coming out of her mouth ! The Wishmaster uses his super-human strength and supernatural abilities to terrorize the college students and kill his innocent victims. The djinn is looking for the waker Diana Collins who freed him his imprisonment in the case to grant her three wishes so he can free his demonic brethren and open the gates of hell to cause Armageddon on earth.  Diana Collins and her boyfriend with the help of Michael the arch-angel must stop the evil djinn and send him back to the evil dimension where he came from.

1635174,4,B00005NKUI,"To be precise, a very gory and violent film. 'Beyond the gates of hell' proves horror films can simply exceed bats, vampires or haunted houses. Witness some genuine horrifying stuff here. The film may frighten or disgust you but its hard to ignore it. A.J Cook was amazing, so was John Novak. May not be a brilliant film, but definitely worth a watch!",1284940800,,351,4.587301587301587

Part 2 was OK. Definitely not as good as the first but not AWFUL. It still had some fun moments and was just cheesy enough to get by.

This movie, however, was devoid of all scares and almost completely lacking in the Djinn department. Seriously...what were they thinking when they wrote this??? It's the worst franchise sequel I have ever laid eyes on! Not a scare in sight and some of the WORST, most poorly put together gore scenes ever. Soooooooo completely lame and non-scary. VERY disappointing. I am watching part 4 now and am thinking it is going to turn out very similar to the way part 3 did. So far, it's looking more like a cinemax softcore porn then a horror film. Maybe that will change...oh well!

On top of that we had a wonderful excess of college kids running away scenes. The characters were garbage, the plot forgettable and the whole ending totally forced. Fastforwarded through plenty of the film after I got sick of pointless or extra long scenes, just stopping long enough to catch up on the plot. So maybe I missed some single line of dialogue that redeemed the entire film but actually that's entirely unlikely. It was awful and unwatchable. Luckily there's no connection between films after the second one so if you're looking to watch the entire series, you can skip from Wishmaster 2 right to Wishmaster 4 and not miss anything.

However, the good parts of this was...well, mainly the gore...the blood was pretty good as far as horror films go...the girl who thought she was too fat and the Djinn made her puke her fat out was pretty outstanding effects...i did like that alot..that basically made the film have 2 and a half stars. i just hope the Djinn wins and the gates of hell open up in the 4th one...maybe i could wish it!",1222905600,,750,4.364285714285714

1635182,3,B00005NKUI,"Other reviewers said it but I had to see it for myself. This is the worst of the series. The first two Wishmasters starred Andrew Divoff as the Djinn and had a different director. This installment features John Novak as the Djinn and there is a new director. Novak's performance is not bad at all. I actually liked him a lot. He is different than Divoff, but not necessarily better or worse. The trouble with this movie is that it deviates from the Djinn's usual duality of Djinn/Nathaniel and instead he becomes a totally different person for the whole movie. The character he takes over is dull and unemotional and totally not witty at all. Everything I love about his usual alter-ego is missing here. Aside from that, it is set on a college campus, which is always a recipe for disaster (or at least for cheesy plots). By far the worst part of this movie is when the heroine invokes St. Michael and he takes over her boyfriend. Geez! In some spiritual circles, St. Michael protects you by sending evil back from whence it came, so it made sense to me that she invoked him and I thought for a minute that this movie might improve, but when he took over the body of the boyfriend and turned out to be a total nothing, all hope sank for any plot improvements at all.

I give this movie 3 stars only for John Novak. He is the only redeeming quality in this movie.",1169683200,,1362,4.383399209486166
1635183,3,B00005NKUI,"Because I own the combo-pack of 1 and 2 together that I paid the same price for ($5.99) but I only bought them because I love the makeup on Andrew Divoff (yes the second one was kinda lame and they used a different actor in the 3rd) the first and 2nd had Divoff and I liked the voice inflections that they did with his voice even though in the extras he sounds very similar to this but I did not understand why they sub-titled it 'Beyond The Gates Of Hell' - (Sword Of Jistice) - because there were no gates of hell in the entire film so I did not really understand that premise. I thought the scene of the woman puking up her stomach could have been deleted as it was disgusting and pretty much unecessary. It seems that they wanted a few people to toss thier cookies.
 But now I think I might sell mine on Amazon now that I've seen it.
 The only reason as to why I liked the first one was because it was directed by Wes Craven. The dialouge and some of the acting in this series was wicked clever.
 So they killed the Djinn at the end of Beyond Gates The Of Hell with 'The Sword of Justice' so if the Djinn is dead then why did they make a 4th movie? They've never showed the rest of the legions from hell or the world between worlds where these demons are supposed to dwell in that poem, but as of this writing (10/11/06) I have no yet seen the 4th installment.",1160524800,,1364,4.082089552238806
1635184,2,B00005NKUI,"This is the weakest of the four in the Wishmaster series.  I had forgotten how poor this was.  If you have not seen the first two of this series, than this would movie would not bother you much.  As a low budget sequal (such as the last few Prophocies and Hellraisers) I'm sure this was churned out in about 20 days of shooting and about 2 million dollars total to shoot.  It meets all the expectations of a semi scary low budget horror/topless flashing girl thrill movie.

  However, Since most people who see this have seen the other two, then you will find this Movie very poorly done.  The finess of the Djinn character is lost due to the poor script.  The way he gets people to to wish is not subtle, the rules set up by the other two are not really followed (1001 souls to collect, the ""that which is eternal can not die"" line, ect...).  The acting affects at times are not congruent with the mood, again compounded by the poor script.  And the story line of how they find the jewel in a fed-exed artifact, right out in the open is lame.  1000 years hidden in box out in the open, passing through many peoples hands, and in 5 minutes a curious college girl can find it.  Not buying it.

OMG that fight was so bad it wasn't even funny...were talking about slow motion swings that i could avoid those moves by not even trying. I do admit that if you like gushing blood....there is plenty here to see.

I hope the original is better then this installment but i have no plans of watching it after this pile of evi(less).  You might want to watch it to complete the trilogy if you enjoy the first ones.

1635186,3,B00005NKUI,"We have had, by turns, hockey masked killers, Halloween masked killers, a demon from the underworld with nails in his head, a guy in a tacky sweater with razor blade claws on his hands, and a malevolent Leprechaun gracing the big and little screens. Well, someone in Hollywood thought, why don't we make a bunch of movies about an evil genie? We'll get some guy to wear a whole body latex suit, complete with horns, and throw him in front of a camera. Then we'll get a bunch of stars who will work for nothing to serve as cannon fodder, throw a script together, and watch the money roll in. The idea that eventually led to the ""Wishmaster"" films probably came about in a way similar to this description. And that's acceptable. There are plenty of us who will shell out bucks to rent or buy a movie about an evil genie trying to trick people into asking for three wishes so he can take over the world. I'd like to start out by reviewing the first ""Wishmaster"" and then moving through the list to the fourth installment, but I haven't watched the first two. Sorry about that. I'll get around to those two eventually. Actually, coming into the series half way through can be a good thing; I don't have any prior expectations to compare this movie against.
""Wishmaster 3"" takes place on a college campus where Diane (A.J. Cook) attends classes with her boyfriend Greg (Tobias Mehler) and friends Katie (Louisette Geiss) and Billy (Aaron Smolinski). A.J. has serious problems, not the least of which is reconciling herself with the death of her parents. Then she worries about her relationship with Greg. She also works with an archeology professor named Joel Barash (Jason Connery) who acts strangely around her. Still, Cook's character is a good student giving serious consideration to graduate school when disaster strikes. While mucking around Barash's office, she spies a jeweled box with strange Arabic inscriptions on it. Diane manages to open the box, thus releasing the evil genie (John Novak). She doesn't know it at the time, but Barash soon discovers what she did when the genie confronts him. The magical creature dumps Joel's body in a coffin and then assumes his physical form. The viewer knows Barash is really the genie because he's constantly cracking his neck in what looks to be a very painful manner. Regrettably, the students don't know anything about the transformation.
The genie that is Barash now begins to seek out students and teachers who will ask him for wishes. The whole idea, apparently, is that the race of djinn (genies, essentially) will take over the world if this genie can get the person who released him, in this case Diane, to make three wishes. This is the overriding goal of the genie, so most of the film consists of Joel Barash trying to track down Diane. In the process, he has fun granting wishes to other people. Sadly, these poor victims don't realize that a wish must be expressed carefully and exactly or the genie will distort the request into something disastrous. Heck, these people don't even realize Joel Barash is a genie. He tricks them into wishing for something and then turns on them. When Diane finally figures out what is going on, she and her friends read up on genies in the school library. Who said college kids aren't smart? By learning about the weaknesses of these evil beings, Cook's character knows she must summon up the Archangel Michael to combat the genie. This angel brings with him a huge sword capable of sending the genie back where he came from. What follows consists of chase and battle scenes between Diane, the angel, and the genie.
I liked ""Wishmaster 3"" for what it was. The gore is good for a low budget sequel. We see a kid flying through the air and landing on some horns (don't ask), a wish for losing weight gone horribly wrong, and another wish concerning a broken heart that is equally gooey. The acting isn't too bad, with Connery and Cook doing the best job. ""Wishmaster 3"" even moves along at a breakneck pace, always a good thing for low budget movies. What doesn't work as well largely centers on the Archangel Michael, a character that just doesn't feel like a good fit in the film. He doesn't really do that much, either, since Diane is the one who must ultimately battle the genie. Another problem is one you need to pay attention if you wish (no pun intended) to see it. The whole movie takes place on a college campus during the semester yet we rarely see anyone around. Check out that car chase on campus-where are all the people? The characters might as well be roaring through a ghost town. The university I go to always has someone driving or walking around, even during the summer. Not at this university. Director Chris Angel probably had problems digging up enough students to provide background. Too, college students would probably yell, goof off, and create a general ruckus. But it is a noticeable problem.
Extras on the disc include a commentary from Angel, Jason Connery, John Novak, and Louisette Geiss, some storyboards, production notes, a short ""making of"" featurette, bios, and a trailer. Not bad for a low budget clunker, eh? ""Wishmaster 4"" isn't as good as this one, which, depending on your attitude probably isn't surprising. I really need to go back and watch the first two, I think, since horror franchises usually start with a bang before tapering off into banality. Yet, I liked this film in a way, and would definitely watch it again.",1086480000,2,5458,4.710251046025105
1635187,3,B00005NKUI,"The third entry in the Wishmaster series pales in comparison to the first two, and the main reason is that Andrew Divoff isn't around to play the Djinn.  Divoff possessed such a canny sense of evil and enjoyment that Jason Connery just can't evoke.  Connery, a nice looking fellow, doesn't possess a third of his father's charisma or screen presence.  A. J. Cook (Final Destination 2, Ripper: Letters from Hell) is a stoic heroine, but she too doesn't possess the fierce determination the previous Wishmaster girls have shown.  Tobias Mehler as the stalwart Greg (and St. Michael the Archangel) is okay, but nothing to write home about.
The plot doesn't explain how the jewel got back in the case; at the end of the second movie, it just disappeared.  There is no mention of the 1000 souls and the Wishmaster doesn't really get into his granting of the wishes.  And since when was the sword of St. Michael able to kill the Djinn.  There is no mention of this in the previous two films.
The third installment lacks the visceral energy and clever dialogue evidenced in the first two films, and director Chris Angel's pacing isn't as tight.  I'll watch the fourth simply to see how the series turns out, but I was admittedly disappointed in this one.

1635189,1,B00005NKUI,"I love horror films when they are well done, but Wishmaster 3 doesn't come close.  The storyline is run-of-the-mill; essentially a weak excuse for a monster to kill a lot of people until he's finally done in himself in the final minutes of the film.  OH, sorry, I gave it away!
So if the plot stinks, the draw's gotta be either the acting (it isn't!), fabulous babes (not particularly), or most likely, the special effects.  And these are just downright laughable.  Anyone with the most rudamentary knowledge of how these things are done can tell immediately; but more importantly, nothing looks remotely real.  When the Wishmaster, in his earthly form (which he dons most of the time so we're even cheated of seeing much of the Djinn!) is struck by a car and re-animates, the viewer can only giggle at how obvious and poorly done it is.  And camerawork plays to this, too; cutting away suddenly when the tricky special effects should be used--such as when the Wishmaster regenerates his amputated hand from a glob of unconvincing red latex and goo to the actor's hand--no transition at all, but instead a camera cutaway and presto, it's a hand again.

As for the second sequel, let's just say it was average. It wasn't as bad as it could have been, being a direct to video sequel and all, but it was really just a rehash of the first movie with a way smaller budget. And that brings me to today's offering, Wishmaster 3. Recentley we have been flooded with horrible direct to video horror sequels(such as Mangler 2, Childern of the Corn 7). So when I saw the trailer for Wishmaster 3 I was really upset. ...After debating for 20 minutes inside of Blockbuster I decided to rent it. And I was pleasantly surprised that I ended up liking this movie. Sure the Djinn is not as scary as Andrew Divoff, but I went along with the movie anyway. I was shocked that this movie had some real twists to it that even had me fooled. And the acting was good. That is what really floored me! The college kids in this movie could really act instead of sounding like they're reading. Most direct to video sequels have terrible acting (again Mangler 2! but that's a different story).
