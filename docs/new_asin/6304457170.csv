I wanted to offer an enrichment project so I bought the movie for them so they could compare and contrast the book from the movie.  The kids absolutely loved the movie! The movie did a great job bringing the characters to life. I love how the movie never changed any of the characters name from the book and they included all of the main parts. Marty (the main character) was captured so well in the movie. The kids were able to get a great picture of a young county boy who was determined to save a dog that he loved so much. After the kids watched the movie, they were able to do a movie review. Then they wrote the cons and pros of the movie. During out class discussion, the kids mentioned that the movie did a great job portraying the characters as the book described them.

Abused by a mean, lonely, hunter who lived by the woods, in addition to his older hunting dogs, he got a one year old, Beagle. And was supposedly training him for the hunting of wild game by kicking, starving and beating his rifle bud into the skull of the dog, so he would obey. Shiloh, ran away and stayed under a bridge until he met Marty, his future owner. Shiloh, is initially returned to his cruel owner but is abused again, and runs away a second time. This time, Marty secretly fixes up a shed in the woods and feeds him table scraps, so his parents don't find out. That is, until his mom follows him and discovers his four-legged, tail wagging, adorable, secret.

885270,4,6304457170,"My bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Shiloh,"" a story of a boy and a dog. Okay, it's a bit out of the ordinary for me but one needs a few changes from time to time. Shiloh was a beagle belonging to a scumbag hunter and he was treated badly under the guise of training him. The little dog got away and was gradually befriended by a young boy. Of course, the boy's parents made him return the dog but a bond had been created and the dog kept returning. The hunter had given his dogs designations of 1, 2, 3, and so on, and it was the little boy who had given him the name of Shiloh after where he was found. In any case, we're dealing with a boy-dog love bond here and the boy was willing to work hard at manual labor in order to buy the dog from the hunter. All seemed to be going well, until the hunter reneged on the deal and the boy was stripped of his beloved dog after all of his work. Of course, it ended happily, but I won't get into that except to say that the ending was rather a letdown.

The movie is easy going and something that could be enjoyed by everyone in the family. Cruelty and harsh language are soft peddled. Everything has rounded corners and would not be offensive to anyone. The kids in the movie come across as pretty good believable actors. The parents and other adults are unbelievably old fashioned, but in a good sense. The scumbag hunter is, well, a scumbag and he has the best acting of the movie. It's a pleasant, lightweight movie that doesn't cut too deeply but might bring a few sniffles from the kids. I recently viewed another boy-dog movie, ""Lassie, Come Home,"" and I'd rate it as far superior in story, acting and emotional content., This is a fine movie, however, especially for the younger set.

885271,5,6304457170,This is a great movie for the family. It teaches values and responsibilites. My kids really enjoyed the movie alot and we recommend this to anyone whom has kids.,1316217600,,161,4.586206896551724
885272,5,6304457170,"Shiloh is a movie about a beautiful beagel puppy that's caught between two neighbors.  The owner that treats the dog like crap is determined to make a hunting dog out of him, however the neighbors right down the hill would rather the beagle puppy live where he will surely be loved and appreciated, which, of course, is with them.

The storyline focuses around the friendly, dog-loving family insisting they will take care of the dog and accept him with open arms, but the mean ol' nasty neighbor has other plans.  It's *his* dog after all- he's the one who paid good money for it.  He won't just give it up so easily.  So what happens?

Well, since Shiloh is mostly a family presentation, this movie is not an example of brutal violence or revenge between two neighbors.  Instead, it's about some simple folks living out in the country and settling disputes amongst themselves with *zero* regard for the actual legal system.  This makes for interesting storytelling because it actually shows human beings reacting fairly reasonably (or unreasonably) towards each other in an an attempt to figure out what exactly to do with the dog.

I say it's ""mostly"" a family movie because it is... for the most part.  The segments that I absolutely *detest* are the ones that show the scruffy neighbor actually kicking the beagle.  Kicking the dog is horrendous enough, but to do it in front of his neighbors really REALLY rubbed me the wrong way.  It showed a complete lack of respect and appreciation for animals.  I didn't like those particular scenes at all.

You may have also noticed that I said the neighbors react ""fairly reasonably"" with each other.  I'm mostly basing this off assumptions that people living in the country and away from having to rely on police officers and whatnot would KNOW right from wrong and would be able to settle disputes in a mature and reasonble manner.  Obviously there's some fiction here because it's entirely possible two neighbors wouldn't have the decency to communicate with each other maturely, leading to unnecessary fighting soon after.  I realize this.  For the most part, the mean neighbor isn't *that* mean (besides of course, the kicking- ugh!)

Anyway, for a low budget family movie the acting is REALLY strong, especially from the little blonde-haired boy who plays lead role.  His character is absolutely awesome.  He's just a kid and acts like more of a man than most people who ARE grown men!

I highly recommend it.  Just try not to cringe at the beagle kicking scenes because anyone who loves dogs will absolutely hate these parts, and justifiably so.",1312329600,,2599,4.830316742081448

We had to turn the TV up to maximum volume to just hear the movie.  And yes, I did try other DVDs and their sound was fine so it was not the TV.",1279411200,,323,3.9384615384615387

The roles were all convincingly played and I found myself really mad at the Scott Wilson character, Judd Travers; Wilson did a great job at being a despicable villain. The other major and supporting roles are well cast and played by seasoned actors and actresses which contribute to the overall ambience of the movie.

Blake Heron plays the part of Marty Preston, our stories hero, and is convincing as the young lad who falls in love with a dog. The dog is in trouble and turns to Marty for help; Marty reacts to the need and decides the dog is his responsibility. That decision is the beginning of Marty's time of testing that will lead to an ending that won't disappoint.

The main character does everything in his power to take the beagle away from its abusive master, even to the point where he's willing to work for it. The boy's father is supportive but realistic. The story teaches good morals about honesty, hard work, and of course, caring for an animal and treating it well. Good DVD for a family car trip.",1244592000,,582,4.715686274509804

885367,1,6304457170,"This is a story of a boy who goes for a walk one day through his West Virginia town and a beagle, Shiloh, follows him home. The boy, Marty Preston, discovers that the dog has an abusive owner. The boy's own family is very poor and cannot afford a pet; also, his father is a firm believer that, abused or not, the dog has an owner and he must be returned. They give the dog back but Shiloh escapes again, and when he turns up outside the Preston home, Marty hides him up a hill behind their house. If you've never read the novel by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, I suppose you might like this movie; however, I'm a fan of the book and I've read it a few times with my language arts classes, and in comparison, the movie is terrible. The family does not appear to be poor, an integral part of the story, and the main character, Marty, is often disrespectful, something he never is in the book. Both of these aspects are important to the story, because they help you to understand why the family cannot keep a dog, why Marty has some difficulty in standing up for himself, etc. And then there's the ending: horrible! The novel has a complex, beautiful ending, one in which you begin to understand the mean dog owner, Judd, and why he is abusive. He and the main character's hostile relationship evolves into something almost like friendship, and it is so well written, it is believable. In the movie, instead of us seeing that, we see what some idiot director must have thought of as a more suspenseful ending.

It especially stresses the importance of children taking responsibility for their pets, and the movie also has a warm family relationship.  While it's pacing is rather slow, the story of how a young boy rescues a beagle from an abusive owner should keep even the smaller kids involved.  The cast does well in their roles:  Blake Heron shines as little Marty, determined to provide a good home for the mistreated Shiloh; Scott Wilson is appropriately evil as the dog's abusive owner; Michael Moriarty and Ann Dowd do well as the parents; and Rod Steiger and Bonnie Bartlett are fine as the elderly couple who befriend the young boy.

885492,1,6304457170,"It really is sad to see Phills Reynold Naylor's great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this.  This film was not at all faithful to the book.  The first difference is that in the book Shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg.  In the movie, the spot is way over on his back!  In the book, Shiloh's tail was a couple inches long.  In the movie, it's like a foot!

The classic ""this little piggy goes to market"" scene has been ommitted, and scene where Shiloh tries to hump the kid's leg was just plain unneccesary. C'mon, this is supposed to be a family movie!

885493,2,6304457170,"This is the type of movie that has me shaking my head and wondering why time, effort and money are invested in such projects while much worthier cinema ideas are left to die 'a'borning'.

Roger Ebert gave this movie three and a half out of four stars.  Although a fan of Ebert's movie reviews in general, I will say that his review of this movie is a good example of why it may be said of his reviews, ""When they are good they are very, very good.  But when they are bad they're just terrible.""

The child lead, Blake Heron is not accomplished enough for casting in anything more ambitious or sophisticated than a school play and the adults who attempt to support him is this travesty of an attempt at a rite of passage film must have been hanging their heads in embarrassment between takes.

Even the old veteran of such notable efforts as ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""The Pawnbroker"", Rod Steiger is cast as a supportive adult trying to help the young boy (Heron) gain the insight and commitment required to get an abused Beagle pup he has become attached to away from an ""old boy"" trapper/poacher.  Perhaps Ebert felt some obligation to pay tribute (with a positive review) to any film in which a minor luminary like Steiger might appear but I can't help feeling that his primary responsibility should to the movie going, purchasing and renting public that reads his reviews looking for guidance in making decisions about investing their time and money.

However, both my 9 year old and I enjoyed the book far more...it gave such a deeper insight into Marty's heart, and into the world of a boy and his dog.  We were both very affected by the book; it made an impression on us that the movie did not.
I especially did not like the addition of another child, a girl, into the story.  It seemed Hollywood wanted to add a little childhood flirting to make the movie more sellable.  That just served as a distraction from this fine story.  There were many differences from the book, but this was the one that irked me.
