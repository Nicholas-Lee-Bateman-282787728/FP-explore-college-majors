2423091,5,B000BKVL9S,"Someone on a camping trip mentioned the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and asked if we could we name them.  I think I named three.

So, when I returned from the trip, I looked the subject up in Wikipedia.  Reading about it was OK, but it didn't really hold my attention.

I found this video very interesting.  It's hosted by Leonard Nimoy. He did all those In Search Of episodes, so this was totally his type of thing.",1186531200,15,423,4.30379746835443

8088247,3,B000BKVL9S,I learned a lot from this DVD - its a tad dated but really not too bad. I was hoping for more on the Colliseum and other world wonders,1369440000,,134,3.6551724137931036
8088248,4,B000BKVL9S,"I have always been interested in the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but of course, except for the pyramids, I regretted that I would never see them.  This documentary does a good job of evoking those long-lost sites through various graphic arts, and I enjoyed learning things I would not otherwise have known, i.e. the Colossus could not possibly have straddled the strait and that a rodent infestation that rustled scared Caligula's thieves from stealing the statue of Zeus! I am glad I own it, as I will likely watch it again.",1333584000,6,533,4.731182795698925
8088249,5,B000BKVL9S,"This is a super video to use in the classroom; to introduce and discuss the ancient wonders, size, area, and history.  I am so glad I ordered this.",1324857600,8,147,4.25
8088250,5,B000BKVL9S,"""Seven Wonders of the Ancient World"" is an A & E studios video about the original ancient seven mysteries: the pyramids of Giza, the hanging gardens of Babylon, the colossus of Rhodes, the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the mausoleum of Halicamassus, statue of Zeus at Olympia, and the lighthouse at Alexandria.  Leonard Nimoy narrates this video, and although dry in spots, for the most part you won't fall asleep in the hour and forty minute long documentary's delivery.  There are many points of information I hadn't heard before (or if I did, I had forgotten).  Each of these seven topics could have their own documentary, and it is nice they are all reduced into short enough segments that it makes this video focus on the more interesting details and then move on.  Some footage is modern day sites of the ruins where these wonders used to be, some footage is artwork or reenactments, and some video is interviews with scholars who share what research has revealed regarding some of the seven wonders of the ancient world.  All in all, of this type of DVD on this topic, this has been one of the better ones I've seen in a very long time.  It helps I suppose that I like Leonard Nimoy, but the documentary actually is well done.",1304208000,20,1233,4.607305936073059
8088251,5,B000BKVL9S,This dvd truly covers all 7 wonders with details I didn't even know about them.  I've watched it several times and its one of my favourites.,1299715200,10,140,4.384615384615385
