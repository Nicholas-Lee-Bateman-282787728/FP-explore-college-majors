I recommend viewers be fully awake before attempting to watch it, as some amount of concentration is required to reap the full benefits of this documentary.  Packed with direct quotes from the Koran and other reliable sources, along with compelling visuals and tasteful interviews, it will challenge even the experts.  Is violence built into the Moslem ideology?  ""Islam: What the West Needs to Know"" addresses this question and I believe answers it.

2625141,4,B000H0UPKI,"""Islam: What the West Needs to Know"" played at Landmark Theaters in Atlanta, Chicago, and in DC in July. I saw it in DC and while it's presentation was plain, the movie was riveting, I couldn't look away.  Its clearly explains the root cause of the growing violence around the world today.  As far as I know, its the only documentary that dares to examine the violent elements of Islam itself.  The doc shows that Islam is not a ""religion of peace,"" but really a type of government that is commanded by Allah to take over the whole earth.  It's conclusion is that we are in a life or death struggle against a formidable enemy.  And the enemy is not ""terror"" or ""extremists"", or Islamo-facists, but Islam itself.",1157155200,31,711,4.5234375

2625162,5,B000H0UPKI,"If just for the two brilliant scholars Bat Ye'or and Robert Spencer alone, ""Islam: What the West Needs to Know"" would be worth watching.  Much like Aleksander Solzhenitsyn did in ""The Gulag Archipelago"" with the reality of the communist Soviet Union, these two have opened the door to let the world see into the factual history of Islam, and the actual words and actions of the Prophet Mohammed and his immediate successors.  They have, in addition, clearly shown how traditional, fundamentalist Muslims view all members of other religions: Those of the book: Christians, Jews, Sabians, and in some cases, Zoroastrians; have only the degraded, inferior status of the dhimmi if they submit and abase themselves before all Muslims, and those not of the book have neither status nor any human rights whatsoever.

It is absolutely paramount to comprehend the mindset, theology and ideology of the traditional Muslim who believes that Islam is Jihad and Jihad is Islam to begin to know how to deal with the challenge that these people present to all of civilized mankind.  It the threat is not understood properly, it can not be deal with properly.  This documentary helps give the viewer much needed information to know how to face the threat.

""Islam"" is divided into six parts that analyze the situation in history and today: ""There is no God, but Allah, and Muhammed is his prophet,"" ""The Struggle,"" ""Expansion,"" ""War is Deceit,"" ""More than a Religion"" and ""The House of War.""  In these six sections, a distinguished group of experts analyze the militancy of Islam's past and present.  After viewing the full documentary, one has to admit that Robert Spencer has quite the valid point when he asserts, ""There are peaceful and moderate Muslims, but there is no peaceful and moderate Islam.""

In addition to the documentary itself, there are Bonus Features: People that gives brief biographies of Abdullah Al-Araby, Walid Shoebat, Robert Spencer, Serge Trifkovic and Bat Ye'or who are featured in the film; Resources that gives the address of Robert Spencers website, JihadWatch; and Texts that gives the editions of the Koran, Hadith and ""The Life of Muhammed"" that are used in the show.

With so much at stake, those in the West need to know the factual, authentic history of the conflict between Western Civilization and fundamentalist Islam and to realize what the Islamists truly want and desire.  With that knowledge, Westerners can determine what strategies to pursue in their own countries to contain radical Islam and deter its violence, and which forces to foster and help in Muslim lands.  Across the Muslim world from Morocco to Algeria to Tunisia to Egypt to Syria to Bahrain there are nations that are fighting against the Islamists, and they deserve our strong support.

I know poison can kill and I don't have to drink it to make sure, plus, as shown in this DVD, you might not get a straight answer because the Koran and words of the Prophet allow a Muslim to ""lie"" to protect Islam.

Basically, if there was a Catholic version of this film all it would say is ""Catholics killed millions of people from the time of the Crusades, the Inquisition, European Civil Wars, and are still bombing houses of people who are gay or give woman abortions."" Of course, nobody would assume that even today Catholics want to kill everyone around them and that the Bible is a formula for violence and world domination. Any violence in the Koran, youll also find in the Bible and the Torah (speaking as someone who has a masters in Religious Studies and has read all three academically). So if you enjoyed this book, its probably because it feed you're own already established opinions about the Koran as being violent and hateful. Terrible movie.

One of the main speakers (as mentioned in the previous comment) is ""Bat Ye'or"" (although this is not even her real name...)

She has never even been a professor at a school and all her research is done independently. She has near no academic recognition whatsoever. If you look her up (which you are free to do) its a fact that can be found very easily. Of course, that is if one looks at legitimate sources and not those of individuals such as Daniel Pipes who claim her to be a ""leading scholar on Islam, ect..."" just to give their own ideas a sense of truth.",1330473600,10,1742,4.604501607717042
2625200,5,B000H0UPKI,"Does Islam sanction violence perpetrated in its name? This is a very disturbing but educational documentary. Currently, Western politicians, the media and Muslim ""activists"" refer to Muslim terrorists as fanatics, a fringe of the Muslim faith. This film posits that the supossed fringe in fact represents true orthodox Islam following a literal interpretation of the Koran.

The history of Islam is traced back to the violence of its earliest days in the 7th century. Shown in its historical context, Islam condones and indeed requires violence against non-Muslims. It is argued that purported peaceful/moderate Muslims must reject the Koran and therefore they are actually outside the true Islamic belief system. The justification for barbaric beheading of perceived enemies is justified because Muhammed himself beheaded people personally as a typical 7th Century warlord. It is noted that some Koran verses speak of peace and tolerance. However those particular verses date back to the earliest days of Islam when Muhammad had few followers and therefore little power. Speaking of peace when one has little power can be seen as pragmatic. Koran verses are not organized chronologically but by their length, longest to shortest. Where conflict arises between verses, those that physically appear later in the Koran make the earlier, longer verses null and void. Thefore the violence inherent in later verses cancel out any peacful notions in the earlier, longer verses written when Islam had less power.

Orthodox Islam is shown to be an all encompassing cultural paradigm dedicated to establishing Islamic law over the entire world. Only then does Islam declare that Islamic ""peace"" will reign over the world. How are suicide bombings justified? To die as a martyr for Jihad is an assurance of salvation in the afterlife. Islam requires Muslims to kill non-Muslims. The goal of Islam is for Muslim law, Sharia, to be spread over the whole world.

Further, September 11, 2001 was not a random date on which to attack the United States. September 11, 1683 was a significant date in Muslim history. The film opines that September 11 was chosen to signal the reimergance of Islamic Jihad against the non Muslim world. Islam is presented as a geopolitical system of government. Sharia is wholly incompatible with Western ideals of human rights.

There are parts of Paris non-Muslims are not allowed to travel. In the Middle East the Muslim powers are looking to create an Islamic Caliphate with all the riots and turmoil in the region.

2625222,1,B000H0UPKI,"I just wish people would really find the truth before they start to tell everyone how wrong something is.  People will believe anything now and days.  If you really research the religion of Islam, you would know this:

Islam never tolerates unprovoked aggression from its own side; Muslims are commanded in the Qur'an not to begin hostilities, embark on any act of aggression, violate the rights of others, or harm the innocent. Even hurting or destroying animals or trees is forbidden. War is waged only to defend the religious community against oppression and persecution, because the Qur'an says that ""persecution is worse than slaughter"" and ""let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression"" (Qur'an 2:190-193). Therefore, if non-Muslims are peaceful or indifferent to Islam, there is no justified reason to declare war on them.

The Qur'an describes those people who are permitted to fight:

""They are those who have been expelled from their homes
in defiance of right, for no cause except that they say,
'Our Lord is Allah.'
Did not Allah check one set of people by means of another,
there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches,
synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of God is commemorated
in abundant measure...""
-Qur'an 22:40

Note that the verse specifically commands the protection of all houses of worship. Finally, the Qur'an also says, ""Let there be no compulsion in religion"" (2:256). Forcing someone at the point of a sword to choose death or Islam is an idea that is foreign to Islam in spirit and in historical practice. There is absolutely no question of waging a ""holy war"" to ""spread the faith"" and compel people to embrace Islam; that would be an unholy war and the people's forced conversions would not be sincere.",1291075200,6,1778,4.96969696969697

2625231,1,B000H0UPKI,"I am a Christian, living in the Midwest United States and have an advanced degree in religion with an emphasis on the study of Islam, from its creation to the present day, as well as on Christianity. I have read the Koran in its entirety and written a number of academic papers on various aspects, including the relationships between Muslims and non-Muslims and the concept of ""jihad.""

Largely for these reasons, I found it extremely hard to make it through this film. It was an extremely frustrating experience for me. The worst thing about the so-called ""faith documentary"" is the fact that it presents a half-truth as an all encompassing view of Islam. Neither I nor any scholar of Islam will deny the fact that there are passages of the Koran and Hadith that encourage violence, in particular towards non-Muslims. There are (at least) two major problems with ONLY presenting these passages, though; first, there are as many if not more passages in these texts that encourage an attitude of acceptance and tolerance towards people of other faiths, especially other monotheists, Christians and Jews, who are referred to as ""people of the book."" Second, doing so fails to fully explain the historical context of these verses. There are essentially three periods here: 1)Early period in which Islam is starting out and has very few followers. At this time they have no power and must be peaceful and try to attract followers. Verses encourage tolerance and peace. 2) Middle period in which Islam has grown and is coming under attack. Verses admit the possibility of violence but only when attacked; only as a defensive strategy. 3) Later period, Islam is more powerful and looking to expand its influence. Verses include the (in)famous ""verse of the sword"" encouraging violence. Many religious scholars postulate that the political situation of Mohammad and his followers had a lot to do with the progression of these verses, something which the film touches on, but does not fully explain. The violence seen in the later periods may have had more to do with the will of some of the original Islamic leaders to create an empire and expand their power than anything else.

The people (I cannot bring myself to use the word ""scholars"" here) interviewed in the film also appear to take for granted the idea of abrogation, that if two passages of the Koran contradict one another, the later one is the one to be followed. This is not always the case within Islam, as they suggest. Especially concerning the theme of violence more than any other, abrogation has been debated and, in many cases, denied. That is, many if not nearly all major Islamic scholars do not believe that the verse of the sword completely refutes the previous verses from earlier periods. For most Muslims, these peaceful and violent verses are taken side-by-side, as most will tell you that they should be.

Of all the other errors and white lies in this film I only wish to mention one more, obvious thing. This film paints Islam with an extremely violent past and present. Both are true, but that does NOT mean that Islam is an inherently violent religion. As to the past, you just have to look at the history of Christianity to see just as much violence. Look at the Christian crusades, look at the expulsion of Jews by Christians throughout Europe from the 1200s onwards, look at the Inquisition. In fact, many of the punishments that they quote in this film from the Koran also appear in the Old Testament, a key Judeo-Christian text. To say that Islam has a more violent history than other religions is quite simply wrong. As to present violence, yes, it is true that many countries with a predominantly Muslim population are more violent places today than predominantly Christian or Buddhist or multi-religous countries. Still, to blame all of this violence on Islam is near-sighted and fallacious. So much of it has to do with the political situations of these countries, and for many the only way that they can justify this sort of violence is by masking it with religion, using the types of verses cited in this film. This does not make Islam a violent religion, it just places it alongside other religions in history as vehicles of manipulation, used to rationalize violence. The same has happened and continues to happen in the name of Christianity. Islam is no more inherently violent a religion than Christianity. The film fails to distinguish between causation and correlation. What we see here is merely a correlation. Islam seems more violent because more Muslims live in politically unstable environments. Islam is not the cause of this turmoil and violence, but merely a tool used by fundamentalists to mask what they are truly doing, another victim of the situation that many of these countries find themselves in. To say otherwise goes against all logic.

The film also fails to adequately explain the ""dhimmi"" relationship between Muslims and people of the book throughout history, as it fails to adequately explain virtually every concept it touches on. If you would like to get a good, well-rounded and completely unbiased view of Islam, I highly recommend the book ""The Vision of Islam"" by Murata and Chittick (and just to make it clear, I have only read their works, I am not trying to make a shameless plug for them. I merely think that they provide one of the better explanations of Islam out there and this book would be very useful for many in the West.) This film, however, will do nothing but stir up greater fear towards this religion and its followers. It is a fundamentalist and extremist response to the extremely small group of Islamic extremists responsible for recent terrorist actions. Just as Islamic extremists twist the Koran to justify violence and manipulate people, so does this film twist the Islamic tradition to accomplish their agenda of increasing fear and distrust in the West towards Muslims. Honestly - and I do not write these words lightly - the makers of this film should be ashamed of themselves, and I am terrified at the prospect of people in the West watching this film and blindly believing every word. Please, please do not help to increase the general ignorance towards Islam plaguing this country. If you watch this film you owe it to yourself and to the millions of Muslims around the world to also seek out a source that provides a more unbiased portrayal of Islam. Then, hopefully you will see that Islam is a much more peaceful, or at the very least much more complex and diverse, religion than the makers of this film would like you to think.",1277424000,92,6582,4.832446808510638

John Spencer was right on the mark when he threw the question back at Muslims supposedly enraged by September 11 (and other terrorist acts) -- ""Why are they upset? Those radical Muslims were simply doing what their religion was telling them to do.""

When I read through the other reviews, those who gave a low rating to the film made attempts to convolute the issue, calling it a ""hate-fest"" among other criticisms. What I stated on the first paragraph of this review is the one they should address, nothing else; if any Muslim claims that their God is not telling them to kill infidels, then let's hear their argument. But if they agree it is true, then what more needs to be said?

That is why Muslims were described by a reporter as ""incubated terrorists"". A good number of Muslims are not really devout to their faith, and hence, still peaceful. In comparison, there are numerous Christians who don't really adhere to the teachings in the Bible. But when a Christian turns devout, they won't see Jesus telling them to kill non-believers. When all Muslims turn devout ...

Be aware of what Islam is really all about. Don't just be content on being politically correct and follow the herd that says Islam is a peace-loving religion. Know the facts.

2625256,2,B000H0UPKI,"""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth"". Henry David Thoreau

I'm not trying to defend Islam or any other religion. I'm simply exposing the ways in which this documentary insults people's intelligence. Also, I was greatly offended by this documentary's consistent underestimating of people's knowledge and intelligence.

This documentary claims the following: ""Relying primarily on Islam's own sources, this documentary demonstrates that Islam is a violent, expansionary ideology that seeks the destruction or subjugation of other faiths, cultures, and systems of government.""
After watching the documentary, I will argue this claim as provided by the interviewees, as ""Islam's own resources"".
I will begin with the most reasonable and justified comments:

1. Bat ye'or; the author of ""the Dhimmi: Jews and Christians under Islam"" 1985, is an Egyptian born British historian specializing in the history of non-Muslims in the Middle East. In her writings, Mrs. Ye'or focused on Islamic Jihad and the rapid transformation of Easterm Christian lands into Islamic territories, and violation of human rights in Islamic cultures.
While all Mrs. Ye'or observations are correct about the dictatorship in Arabic cultures and mistreatment of minorities; she forgot that this mistreatment impacts Muslims as well, and this is what totalitarian governments are all about. Simply because the majority population of these countries is Muslim, doesn't mean that the religion itself is bad. It is time to differentiate between the evil of people and their religions.
Also, the spread of Islam in Europe after AD 710, during the Umayyads and Abbasids rule, occurred during a period of political and moral corruption after the death of Muhammad (who died in 632). The existence of an Islamic kingdom at the time, did not mean that it was ruled according to the religion itself. No sane person would argue that invasion and killing are not bad, but if we are going to blame political crimes on religions, then we have to think that Hitler (who was Christian) perpetrated the Holocaust because Christianity is a bad religion, or that Israel has invaded Palestine because Judaism is bad. This sort of logic misses the point that it is individuals acting on their interpretations of religious or philosophical beliefs or simply someone of a particular religion acting in a questionable way.

2. Dr. Serge Trifkovic; is a Serbian-American writer and the author of ""The sword of the Prophet"", who holds a PhD in history from the University of Southhampton and is an expert on Balkan politics and a regular columnist for several conservative publications in the United States.
Here I present three important facts:
* Dr. Tifkovic doesn't have any experience to allow him to speak as an expert in Islam.
* Dr. Trifkovic is of Serbian origin, and we can't ignore the ethnic cleansing directed by native Serbians in former Yugoslavia against Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims. Using the same standards that Dr. Tifkovic is using, one might say that Christianity is evil because of the massacres carried in Kosovo against Muslims in 1992, but we have to be more open minded than that and agree that the religion of the killers should not be blamed for their evil.
* It's important to note that there was a long standing historical hatred between Christians and Muslims in the former Yugoslavia, which has its origins in Ottoman invasions.  I think it is fair to argue that the Ottomans were acting more in their own self political interest than in the interest of Islam.
I tried to listen objectively to Dr. Tifkovic, but when he started talking about the instant gratification described in Islam and humorously said"" it's not suitable to talk about it in front of a family audience"", I concluded that this information is what he got from all the stupid comments given by suicidal bombers, Bin laden, and Zarqawi.
Real study of the Qur'an would reveal that all famous promises of virgins in heaven are man made. It's ok if the uninformed masses think that, but if a PhD in history discusses it on TV in the way he did, it is a sign of a sweeping universal stupidity. The only reason for mentioning virgins in the Qur'an was to say that people all will be virgins in heaven, as all earthly pleasures are not going to exist there.

3. Another interesting character interviewed, Mr. Robert Spencer, holds a Master's degree in the department of Religious Studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 1986. I thought again that I would learn something from an ""expert"" on Islam, but he focused on the concept of ""Taqiyya"" which is, according to him, an Islamic method of deception and hiding one's faith while among enemies. As a fluent Arabic speaking person who studied the Qur'an and Hadith (Not all hadith is proven to be correct or reliable, as it's been told and passed by memorization and oral tradition), I tried to understand Mr. Spencer's accent while he spoke the word  ""Taqiyya"" and thought that perhaps it was a different word he was referring to.
It took me few minutes to figure out what word he was using; this word is an Arabic slang for a ""hat"". No kidding; the ""expert"" used a slang word that wasn't used a few hundred years ago, but that gave me a clue about Mr. Spencer's sources. Mr. Spencer is not relying on Islamic sources as claimed, but some unreliable internet sites. (the reader can check for his/herself).
When Mr. Spencer attempted to justify the Crusades while demonizing the Islamic spread in Europe; I lost interest in his double standard logic which allows some to encourage war, while criticizing the extremist Muslims, who do likewise. Finally Mr. Spencer concludes that even Muslims who claim that they are against killing and forced conversion are simply lying. Furthermore; he says that if they claim suicide is not allowed in Islam then they are lying as well because , or so his logic goes, if the suicide bombers are faithful Muslim, then Islam must allow suicide and it must be terrorist based political movement; a very educated conclusion indeed.

4. Another person called ""Abdullah Al-araby"", who I've never heard of or read any thing by him was talking about deception being allowed in Islam according to the saying ""war is deception"" and claimed it was part of the Hadith. The statement referred to is an Arabic saying not proven to have been spoken by Mohammed. Al-araby proceeded to say:"" In Islam, it is allowed to lie in general, you can lie to your enemy, to your family, to your wife..."".
The gentleman didn't provide any evidence to support his claim, and I'm at a loss to know where in Quran or Hadith he found that explanation.

5. My favorite, another ""expert"" called Walid Shoebat; a former terrorist and the author of ""Why I left Jihad"". It is possible to admit one's mistake and change his/her ways, but I wonder if that is enough to make the person an expert on Islam. The former terrorist talked about the beheading of ""banu Qurayza"" by Mohammed relying on some Persian and Indian art as his source and claiming that it is Islamic art. This kind of art came to life a few hundred years after the death of Mohammed and in no way can be considered a clue to the origin of beheading in Islam; especially not in the Quran or verifiable Hadith.
Shoebat also talked how he as an employee of an American company used to lie and fake compassion with Americans and scream ""Allahu Akbar"" on the high way as he left work. Shoebat concluded that this is the general way Muslims act and they are all liars, and then talked about false meanings of Jihad, heaven, and anti-Semitism in Islam. Again, this ""expert"" relied on his personal experience as a member of a terrorist group focused on hate and destruction called ""fatih"" in Israel/Palestine.

6. The only two people who said anything positive about Islam weren't identified.

7. Two short broadcasts from a radical well known Arabic channel were used to prove how Jihad and martyrdom are Islam's way of advertising killing. The two words of ""jihad"" and martyrdom"" have been abused by Muslim suicide bombers and radicals claiming to represent Islam, but clearly representing only their own hateful views. Jihad is the spiritual struggle against desires and sins, while martyrdom is dying to defend one's family, life, or land.

I was about to give this documentary a negative vote if possible, but being good hearted as I am, I gave it 2 stars: one star for getting one thing right; the call to prayer that started this work, another star for interviewing Bat Ye'or who studied history and actually had some historic knowledge even though she did not reach a reasonable conclusion.  She can share the star with the other ""experts"" who wore suits, talked with great confidence but lacked credible evidence to substantiate their claims.",1236124800,21,8831,4.898996655518395

2625269,1,B000H0UPKI,"This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say. I am not a Muslim, nor am I an Islamic studies expert, but I know enough to shed some light on the obvious one-sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses.

The problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary. Most of the documentaries that I have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation. This is certainly the case with Islam: What the West Needs to Know. Yes, there are fundamentalists around the world, and some of them are Muslim, but to build a documentary about all of Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. This is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more.

For those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary, here are several points that may help.

There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary.

The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside of that region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia.

The translation of the Qur'an used in the documentary is a questionable one. I watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking. I had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now I know why. Surrah 98:6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that the Surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell. But the translation I have reads instead: ""Those who reject Truth among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists will be in hellfire."" The difference is that those who reject Truth are those people who know about God and the Truth of God and decide to reject it anyways.

The movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in Islam, but this is not true. Although it is true that much comes from the Qur'an and Hadith, Islam also recognizes a concept called `Urf or ""normative behavior."" Obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways, but `Urf is meant to be ""good"" behavior, what an average person would consider right or wrong.

The documentary presents Shar'ia (Islamic Law) as being one unified body of knowledge that all Muslims follow. This is simply not true. There are many Islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law.

The Hadith tradition is similar. There are thousands of Hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others. Using the Hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate, real and applicable, is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say... which is what the documentary did.

What I hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on. I know this is not the same as suicide bombing, just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem. If you feel you have THE answer, then everyone else must be wrong. But if you feel you have AN answer you can work together with other people's views about politics, religion, God, or whatever.",1218931200,64,3435,4.949652777777778

Assuming that even now in 2008, even after Bush admitted there was no WMDs, 38% of Americans still believe that lie, surely that is the targeted audience for the Islamophobe par excellance Robert Spencer.

To him, not radical Islam but ALL OF ISLAM is the new enemy. His ""expertise"" is colored by his own Christian dogma and bias.

His exploitation of people's ignorance of Islam (especially as I said before Americans who are made to fear Iraq, Iran, and if Robert Spencer has his way, all of Islam and Muslims) and propping it up as the ""new threat"" like Communism.

In that sense he is a very sly and dangerous author who has nothing of substance to offer about Islamic faith save demonizing its creed while praising his own Christian faith, which is the epitome of a shallow dishonest intellectual.

It seems in his DVD, the author is more content with capitalizing on the geopolitical events centered around politics and terrorism and try to link that with the faith of 1/5th of humanity, to further legitimize wars of aggression and wars for Israel, after all he does work for the right-wing pro-Israel Zionist David Horowitz and his ""Freedom Center.""

2625279,1,B000H0UPKI,"First of all, The same DVD could have been produced about CHRITIANITY.

The producers and reviewers of this movie desperately must be really angry! So much hate!!

Of course Islam has a past of violence, has a population of 1.4 billion of believers and consequently bad apples of few violent believers are mingled in the basket. Muhammad was a messenger from God that DEFENDED his faith from those who saw him as a threat (so please replace the history in the CONTEXT!). So yes he defended himself. All true! But half-true. Another truth is well concealed, and a lot of people from the West do not want you to know about it. Maybe you should watch ""Islam: Empire of Faith"" to have a glimpse of what I am writing about.

That being said, please remind me how CHRISTIANITY propagated around the globe (America, Europe, Africa, Oceania)? By turning the other cheek? With no violence? Is that what you learn in school?

You think that JESUS CHRIST did not preach violence? If yes, then from this day on, stop watching Hollywood movies on the Bible, stop go to church to listen to the best parts of the Holy Bible, and start reading the Book by yourself:

1) In Leviticus 25:44-46, the Lord tells the Israelites it's OK to own slaves, provided they are strangers or heathens.

2) In Samuel 15:2-3, the Lord orders Saul to kill all the Amalekite men, women and infants.

3) In Exodus 15:3, the Bible tells us the Lord is a man of war.

4) In Numbers 31, the Lord tells Moses to kill all the Midianites, sparing only the virgins.

5) In Deuteronomy 13:6-16, the Lord instructs Israel to kill anyone who worships a different god or who worships the Lord differently.

6) In Mark 7:9, Jesus is critical of the Jews for not killing their disobedient children as prescribed by Old Testament law.

7) In Luke 19:22-27, Jesus orders killed anyone who refuses to be ruled by him.

You think that the Muslims invented stoning (or lapidation). Wrong! You want a proof of evidence? Please check the Holy Bible in Deuteronomy 22:23-24.

Islam has also written violent pages throughout history. Yes! Islam has its own (few) horrid extremists. But it would be WRONG to think that Christianity is immaculate of any violence since the last 2008 years. So as Matthews said (7:1-5): ""You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye.""

Now that you know about the violent side of Islam, please inform yourself about the tolerant side of this Faith that shaped the Western civilization. Yes, shaped! But I am not giving you a history lesson, dude. Like the Muslim extremists (again a minority), you should go beyond your IGNORANCE and start knowing about the TRUTH, and not half of it.

You want to be manipulated by half of the facts, fine. You want to hate the other without knowing his history or legacy, fine. You don't want to understand that IGNORANCE will kill us all one day, fine. Then get drafted in the Army, go to Irak, and shoot some evil Muslims, all this in the name of Almighty God.

Please learn more about Islam and its history. Don't get stuck in its violent chapters. The same DVD could have been produced about CHRITIANITY.",1206489600,17,3200,4.607394366197183

2625284,5,B000H0UPKI,"If your reason for not purchasing this DVD is because you read one of the 1 star reviews think again. There is not a single negative review that can refute the accuracy of this documentary. The reason is because this documentary backs up what it says! Now, did the 1 star review that persuaded you not to buy this DVD actually make a case (from the inspired texts of Islam) that this DVD is a false presentation of Islam? I seriously doubt it! The difference here is that this presentation is documented while the negative 1 star reviews are merely speculation and wishful thinking. As if the reviewer claims, ""I would like Islam to be everything it is not"". Rubbish! Buy the disc and submit to the truth of the ""facts"" not the 1 star reviewer who's favorable bias towards Islam would tell you that Islam is not what it claims to be. In the end the Koran and the teachings of Muhammad speak for themselves. There is no need to put a ""spin"" on Islam when Islam speaks for itself.

Islam: What the West Needs to Know is essential viewing for those seeking to ""fully"" understand the face of Islam. Case and point:

1. Those who criticize this video as ""one sided"" or a ""distortion of Islam"" are refuted by the numerous and accurate citations in the presentation. To say that ""fundamental"" Islam is ""something other"" than the accurate and historical picture demonstrated in the following video is to deny the entire argument of the presentation, not to mention the teaching of the Koran... this is the documented, verifiable history of Islam and the actual reality of Jihad in the world.

2. Muhammad did sanction and found beheading as he beheaded men himself. Fundamental Islam (which is true Islam) seeks to conquer the world. Everything must be placed under the subjection and rein of Allah. The method for doing this is outlined in the Qur'an (as presented here in the video).

3. Those who attempt to rescue Islam, believing that it is something peaceful, would themselves be the victims of Islam. It matters not how `tolerant' we desire to be; fundamental Islam is not tolerant! Those who practice fundamentalism practice the teaching of the Koran and Muhammad in their proper context. Simply look at the arguments between fundamentalists and liberal Muslims. Hands down the liberals have nothing to say. In fact, the liberal Muslim is nothing more than a humanist. Further, should the fundamental Muslim conquer the liberal Muslim- the liberal would no longer be a liberal. Essentially, all the liberal Muslim is lacking is a consistent conversion to the teaching of the Koran. This usually takes place whenever the two intellectually meet. The liberal cannot answer the arguments of the fundamentalist. It is the same for every major religion. Those who spiritualize Jihad or polygamy (in the case of Mormons) fail to understand the teachings of their religion. The fundamentalist is (in most cases) the true disciple.

4. Those who defend Islam by hiding behind the idea of tolerance fail to demonstrate tolerance as a virtue for a religion that has no tolerance. Defend all you will, for in the end you have no citations from the Quran or Muhammad consistent with the Koran. The history of Islam is that of violence. In every age when it began to gain followers it has resulted in war. It will be no different in the West. Islam demands violet confrontation because it demands unquestioning conversion.

5. The video consists of interviews with top scholars and certain images. However, the overall reason to purchase this DVD is so that one can get an accurate understanding of fundamental Islam. This is a great introduction not because of the cinematography or entertaining presentation, but because of the important information.

LET ME SAY IT AGAIN- THOSE WHO CRITICIZE THIS DOCUMENTARY DO SO WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT FOR THEIR POSITION. THE VIDEO IS PACKED WITH CLEAR REFERENCES TO THE VIOLENT TEACHINGS OF ISLAM. WHAT MORE IS NEEDED TO PROVE THAT ISLAM IS VIOLENT OTHER THAN 1) THE WAY IT STARTED, 2) WHAT IT STATES IN ITS ACCEPTED DOCUMENTS AND 3) HOW ITS CONVERTS CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN THE WORLD?

In this video the history and theology of Islam is accurately portrayed so that it cannot be refuted. Of course, the naive and moronic will deny it, but their denials will not amount to a logical refutation of the position. Those who dislike this video don't bring rational arguments to the table- they bring rhetoric and misguided feelings instead of logic and reason.

In order to refute this presentation one must demonstrate that it misquotes Muhammad and the Koran. It is not enough to simply assert that this in a misrepresentation- instead one must prove (from the same resources utilized in the film) that this documentary has misrepresented Islam.

If you read that book and watch this DVD, you will be compelled to discard the politically correct misconception that Islam is a religion of peace.

If you read the Qur'an by itself, you will find it largely inoffensive.  In point of fact, the Qur'an is drastically less violent than the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament).  If you read the Qur'an in the context of the life of Muhammed and the subsequent history of Islam, however, a different picture emerges.  To understand Islam as it really is, it is crucial to know the hadith (traditions) about the prophet and the history of his life.

This is where the DVD is useful.  One of the myths that is exploded is the idea that ""jihad"" means an inner spiritual struggle.  Muhammed was a warlord, a man of violence.  He participated in several battles.  He urged his believers to fight for his cause, to fight and kill and die for the idea that ""there is no god but Allah, and Muhammed is his messenger.""  So while it is true that the word Jihad simply means ""struggle"", and it can refer to an inner spiritual struggle, in the context of the life of Muhammed and in the Qur'an, it overwhelmingly refers to physical warfare against unbelievers for the sake of Islam.  Warfare for Islam and against the unbeliever is a central dogma of Islam.

In fact, Muhammed taught that the only way to be absolutely certain of paradise was to die in Jihad, killing and being killed to advance the cause of Islam.  The certainty of paradise if a Muslim was killed in Jihad, and the reward of booty, slaves, and lording over subject populations if he survived, explains the rapid Muslim conquests during Muhammed's life and after his death. (Within 100 years after Muhammed's death, Islam had swepted from Arabia into India, in the east, and into the heart of France, in the west.)  Truly peaceful Muslims are either ignorant of the meaning of Jihad or have consciously chosen to reject that part of orthodox Islam.

Knowing who Muhammed was and what he did goes a long way toward explaining contemporary Muslim actions.  For example, Muhammed ordered and physically participated in the murder by decapitation of 600 Jewish men in Medina, so when modern Mujahideen cut off the heads of their captives while yelling ""Allah is greater,"" they are following the example of Muhammed.  Muhammed also ordered the assassination of poets, writers, and others who ridiculed, lampooned, satirized, or otherwise disrespected him, and those murders were carried out by his followers.  So when modern Muslims go on a ""cartoon Jihad"" and riot over Danish newspaper cartoons, and when the Iranian Mullahs issue a fatwa calling for the murder of Salman Rushdie, they are following the example that Muhammed set during his lifetime.

Perhaps the biggest misconception that Westerners have is that Islam is a religion like Christianity, Judaism, Bhuddism, etc., which is concerned only with the spiritual life.  In fact, Islam is a totalitarian system that governs the conduct of every aspect of society, really more analogous to communism or fascism than to Western notions of religion.  Islam is not so much a religion as it is a political/social system with a religious/spiritual component.  The separation of mosque and state is an heretical concept in Islam.  Pluralism, democracy, freedom of religion, freedom of speech-- these are alien to Islam.  For this reason, any hope that Islam is compatible with American society is suicidal self-delusion.  It is long past time to wake up from this delusion.

It occurs to me that the falsehood that ""Islam is a religion of peace"" is less a product of multi-culturalism or political correctness than of Western cultural imperialism.  Our Western religions, e.g., Christianity, are in fact religions of peace, therefore we decree that all religions are religions of peace.  Do not bother us with the details!  We decree it!  If we were a bit more humble--indeed, if we were true multiculuralists--we would recognize that not all religions are the same, and that we cannot force our conception of what a religion should be (i.e., peaceful) on the Islamic world.  We can only deal realistically with the consequences of the fact that Islam is a violent, expansionist, totalitarian religio-political system.",1202169600,18,4613,5.1738544474393535

2625292,1,B000H0UPKI,"Unfortunately, this film and those involved with its production selectively pick and chose the information which they present and present it without any explanation of historical context etc.  For these people, Islam is violent bc of certain texts taken out of context and the fact that they rely on radical fringe Islamic groups for quotes and their interpretation of the Qur'an.  Isa (Jesus, Peace be Upon Him) is highly venerated and an important person in Islam.  Unfortunately, those responsible for putting this together and with commenting within it are under the mistaken impression that being a former Muslim means that you have credibility as an expert on Islam.  It does NOT! There are many people who are Muslims who are ignorant of the long, complicated process of decisions by Muslim scholars throughout the centuries which contributes to the body of what is ""Islamic (Sharia) Law"".  If Robert Spencer is an expert on Islam, then David Koresh and Jim Jones are experts on Christianity. Are Christianity and Judaism violent religions because in the Hebrew scriptures (which Christians consider sacred scriptures as well) God ordains and even in some instances commands the taking of slaves, and God commands (and in some instances is portrayed as the one doing the fighting and killing) Israelites to slaughter every living thing in many of the cities which is taken?  The prophet Nahum rejoices at the fall of Nineveh and portrays God as mocking and torturing the Assyrians.  The New Testament book of Revelation pictures Jesus as a warrior who consumes and destroys a mass of humanity.  Do these facts, and others, make Christianity a violent religion?  Christians would answer ""No"" and would object that these verses are being taken out of context.  Exactly.  Those responsible for this production mistakenly believe that the only way to read a scripture (theirs included) is literally, woodenly, and without contextual understanding.  They neglect to inform you that when the Muslim armies defeated the Byzantines and Persians and established control over an area, the population was not forced to convert, and many, especially those Christian groups which the Byzantines considered ""heretical"" welcomed the Muslim rule.  In Jerusalem, Jews had much freer access to their holy sites than they had enjoyed under Christian rule.  When the Christians came through on their Crusade to Jerusalem in 1099ad they slaughtered most the people in Jerusalem, JEWS AND OTHER CHRISTIANS INCLUDED!!  One could make a documentary 10x as long with examples of Christian scriptures which support violence, and Christians throughout the centuries as supporting violence, and there are and have been many Christian terrorists and terrorist groups in america and around the world which claim to act in the name of Jesus, does this mean Christianity is violent?

The main benefit of this DVD for me is that I was under the same misconception that most of our western leaders hold - namely that Islam is the ""Religion of Peace"".  Based on the translations from the Quran, I have a hard time believing that now.  Further, it shows that one needs to view translations with a grain of salt.  I still do not know with authority which translation is most accurate... the ones we have had for all time or the ""Noble Quran"", which is MUCH more supportive of the activities we witness today.

Whether all of Islam follows the jihad mentality or not is not as important as knowing that those who do feel that they have religious ""authority"" to do so!!!  How does one even begin to argue against a religious belief?? (Suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!)

Americans and Europeans as well as the whole world has the God-given right to embrace the idea that God is not a trinity or partial to only one set of people by blood. Islam says God loves all people the same and most of all that GOD IS ONE. These are the most basic ideas of Islam and somehow these ideas seem to really upset people like Robert Spencer. But then, people like Robert Spencer got upset in the 50s about Martin Luther King. Spencer spends his life trying to scare people away from Islam, but Islam in the West keeps right on growing.

2625304,5,B000H0UPKI,"A low key and scholarly presentation of Mohammad's revelation and actions with respect to unbelievers. It adds piece after piece of the whole Islamic history to finally leave one with the impression that this is truly a blockbuster that must be seen by every American. The featured speakers present many critical pieces of the Islamic record covering over 1380 years.

The testimony of Walid Shoebat, a former Jihadist for al Fatah is particularly interesting as he describes working in the United States, and also his experience as a bomber.

The speakers cover political Islam in six topics:
1)  There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his Prophet. They discuss the sanction of Islam for violence against unbelievers, the unique nature of the Koran, and the change in Muhammad's recitation from Mecca to Medina.
2)  The Struggle. Jihad and the special provisions for those killed while defending or advancing Islam.
3)  Expansion. The directives to expand Islam to dominate every other religion.
4)  ""War is Deceit."" The role of taqiyya in Islamic society and it's use in America to deceive non-Muslims about their goals.
5)  More than a religion. Islam is more a project of geopolitical conquest than a religion. The Western concept of separation of church and state is heretical.
6)  The House of War. Islamic fundamentalists are a sleeper cell in America.

This DVD makes clear that the political component of Islam is dominant over the religious content. Although a Muslim would never separate political and religious spheres, the West has learned through hundreds of years of bitter religious strife that failure to do so just leads to more mindless slaughter. Islamic scripture does not lend itself to this separation. It may well be destined to generate new heights of slaughter.

I fully concur with reviewer ""Pattic"" (27 August 07) whom I have tried to avoid repeating. ""Sparkles"" (9 July 07) has also written a brilliant review which I recommend. Many other reviewers have done a superb job and have added to the information about this important DVD. However you must see it. If the material is new to you watch it several times. I have read over 50 books on Islam and many biographies of Mohammad, most by Muslims. This DVD summarizes a great number of these and needs to be taken very seriously.

This is a belief system with which it is possible to make truces when it is in a position of weakness (but never peace). As Robert Spencer says ""There, in short, are peaceful and moderate Muslims, but no peaceful and moderate Islam.""

2625308,1,B000H0UPKI,"This is an outrageous film and represents dishonesty at its height.  This film completely ignores the reality of Islamic history and what more recent and honest scholars have been saying about it.  It totally ignores that Mohammad and his followers were fiercely and mercilessly persecuted for years and years, and when ""permission"" was finally given, the very purpose was to safeguard religious rights and to prevent the destruction of not only mosques, but churches and synagogues as well -- this is clearly stated in the Koran but nowhere mentioned in this film.  This film picks out verses of the Koran, presents them completely out of context and thus distorts their meaning for a self-serving interpretation -- this film completely ignores the preceding and following verses which provide a full and complete context each and very time. It also picks out statements of Mohammad, authenticated or not, and deliberately spins them in order to make him look as horrible as possible without any due regard to the circumstances in which they were made or contrasting them with other statements made by him that have been definitely authenticated.  Clearly, this film is made by anti-Islamic propogandists who, of course, make absolutely no mention of Jesus stating in the Bible that he only came to bring war -- Mohammad never made such an explicit statement like that, but Jesus did.  I am not saying that Jesus preached violence, but my point is that statements can always be picked out and presented in as distorted a manner as one likes.  Picking out certain events and statements in post-Mohammad history are also not helpful.  Osama bin Laden and his whacky clones should not be taken as representative of the Islamic faith any more than should the gory horrors of St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, Bloody Mary, Hitler, the indiscriminate massacring by the Crusaders, etc. etc. etc., should be taken as evidence of the ""true nature"" of Christianity. Also, during the Middle Ages when Muslim scholars were diving the world up in terms of ""Dar ul Harb"" and ""Dar ul Iman"" (House of War and House of Faith, respectively), they were doing so during the Age of Empire and religious terminology was used rempantly. In those days, the world was about being ""with us or against us"" (sound familiar?).  Besides, this type of rhetoric was nothing compared to what the Europeans were saying about the ""barbarian"" East.  Clearly, the dishonesty of this film is deliberate as it does not take more than a few minutes of honest reading to clear up such rampant falsehood.",1190592000,40,2561,4.978922716627634

The format is excellent. Throughout the video you are shown clips by world leaders, politicians, etc., who chant the ""Islam as a religion of peace"" mantra. Then you are shown interviews by leading authorities in the study of Islam (men and women whose credentials are unassailable). These interview clips clearly and convincingly refute what the cultural elites and media are saying. The interviews are punctuated with quotes from the Koran and Haddith. Occasionally they also show clips from Muslim sermons, rallies, etc., that are quite disturbing.

I can't imagine someone watching this DVD and not coming away convinced that Islam is inherently a political ideology akin to Communism--i.e., not a ""personal religion"" like us Westerners view every other religion--, with clearly distinguishable dogmas that advocate physical jihad (not ""spiritual jihad against one's passions"") against unbelievers, the goal of which is to usher in a global theocracy of Shariah Law.

This movie should be watched by every sober-minded Westerner. Our politicians need to wake up, study these issues, and become intellectually honest in their portrayal of Islam. We have for too long been led astray by the ""Islam is a religion of peace"" propaganda. It is not too late for America, though it is probably too late for Europe (which Bat Ye'or has rightly dubbed ""Eurabia"").

2625316,5,B000H0UPKI,"Islam: what the west needs to know - is not a documentary; it is a propaganda film, no question about it. This is no objective exploration on an issue. It is purely intended to convince you of a viewpoint. However, you do need to keep one thing in mind: Just because it has a viewpoint, doesn't mean it isn't right.

This film is rather dry production-wise. There is very little in the way of film or voiceover. It consists largely of maps, slide-style overlays of Koranic verse quotes, and interviews with authorities on Islam and the history of the middle-east, including an ex-member of Hamas, who has since converted to Christianity, immigrated to the U.S., and written book entitled :""Why I left Jihad"".

Normally, I loathe propaganda of any stripe, even in the rare instances where it agrees with my politics and worldview. But I recommend this film without hesitation. Why? For two reasons:

1) There is no objective programming on this subject in the U.S. or European media...period. The only difference is, that all the other info available, other than print, is pro-Islamic propaganda. So really, watching an agenda piece on the opposite side, is the only way to get this information. Between the mainstream media version, and this film, you may finally be able to glean something useful via a combinaton of the two. And you will.

2) The vast majority of what is presented is entirely factual, and beyond argument. Various direct quotes from the Koran itself, leave beyond any doubt that extreme violence is indeed not only sanctioned by Mohammed, but was actively engaged-in by ""The Great Prophet"" himself, as in the verse from the ancillary texts that tells a tale of Mohammed personally beheading between 400-900 Jews, or the one relating his marriage to a 9-year-old girl. The film does not make these up, they are there for any to read for himself. Make no mistake, this cat was no Jesus-like figure of peace and passivity. He was, historically speaking, a warlord, who rode at the head of an army, spreading his new faith through conquest; far more akin to Alexander or Ghengis Khan than a benign Buddah-like teacher.

The basic thrust of the films premise is the Koranic tradition of abrogation. Although you hear much from apologists about the instances of tolerant verses in the Koran, what you don't hear about, is the Koranic tradition of chronologically later verses abrogating (to make null and void) earlier ones. Not unlike a papal decree voiding a biblical issuance. Virtually all of the more peaceful and tolerant verses antedate the violent and intolerant ones, thereby leading muslim clerics to proclaim the latter to be the definitive and valid ones, cancelling out the older. The film certainly did not invent this either. It is a well-known aspect of Islamic theology.

 Where the viewpoint comes in is, whether or not you believe the film's implication, that a large number of Muslims take the Koran's commands to fight until the whole world cries ""There is no god but Allah,and Mohamed is his prophet"", in a literal way, and are intentionally spreading throughout Europe and North America with the full purpose to grow in numbers and influence, eventually conquering the infidels from within.  It leaves however, no doubt, that any who do are an extreme danger to any culture; and no doubt whatever, that many, at least, do.

I found all of the speakers informative and credible, but especialy the ex-Hamas member. Once you reach a certain age,your B.S. meter is dificult to fool, and I found his take on a culture he knows better than anyone,to be believeable, and frightening.

This issue is timely and of enormous importance, and should be of high interest to anyone,regardless of political stripe, but sadly, and to me curiously, it seems to be largely the left who refuse to discuss the matter. One would think that they, especially, would be concerned that there was potential for great harm inherent in any movement,in whom anti-semitism is an intrinsic and unshakable part. Exactly how many videotaped speeches from al-jazeera ranting about the extermination and murder of the Jewish race,do they need to see before smelling something dangerous? Presumably such rhetoric is only troublesome if uttered by western caucasians wearing armbands.

Listen to the testimonies of these people, specially of Walid Shoebat, ex-Palestinian terrorist who changes a life of hate in the Islamic fashion for a love-filled life as a follower of Christ Jesus (only He could help make such a dramatic life change possible).

Here is the truth about Islam from those who really know because they have been part of it, its culture of death and hatred; they either suffered it or caused others to suffer it. The bible foretold about the sons of Ishmael, that they would be a violent man and stand in front of their neighbors. He stands alright, challenging the world to do make a decision: voluntary submission or death. We must not let hatred be the grounds for a new uncivil civilization.

2625323,4,B000H0UPKI,"Watching Islam: What the West Needs to Know without any previous knowledge of Muslims or the Koran is akin to going deep sea diving for the first time with no formal training, or, more realistically, like watching Michael Moore's Sicko without ever experiencing the American healthcare system first hand. A lot of information is thrown around and without the proper education to either agree with or dispute any of it, it all must be digested as factual. Depending on who you ask, this is the proper way to view this unbiased and revealing documentary or you are being tricked by this xenophobic and hateful piece of anti-muslim propaganda.

It's not surprising that a film whose sole purpose is to answer the question ""Is Islam itself a violent religion?"" with a resounding ""Hell Yes!"" should be just a tad controversial. Featuring interviews with several noted experts on Islam and indepth examinations of the Koran and other Islamic texts, the case against a peaceful Islam is slowly and methodically built throughout the film. Islam is presented as an intolerant and destructive ideology rather than the peaceful, yet misrepresented, religion that both Eastern and Western leaders purport it to be. ""Like Nazism and Communism, in Islamism the end justifies the means... the whole idea is to promote their way of thinking and to promote their way of life throughout the world."" says author and former terrorist Walid Shoebat. Candidly discussing his involvement in bombings and terroristic attacks, Shoebat provides a chilling description of life as a Muslim both in the Middle East and in the United States.

The film is split into six parts, with each part explaining a bit more about Islam. There is a section on the exclusiveness and intolerance of Islam (""There is No God But Allah...""), a section on what ""jihad"" really means (like ""mein kampf"" it means, ""my struggle""), a section on the expansion of Islam through violence, a section on the mistakes and misrepresentations of Islamist apologists, a section on the totality of Islam (""More Than a Religion""), and a final section entitled ""The House of War"" that establishes that violence is and always has been a part of Islam. Whether or not all of the information can be taken at face value, first time filmmakers Bryan Daly and Gregory M. Davis present a very compelling argument. It's cut together more like an educational film than most of the flashy documentaries that come out today, and that only serves to boost the feeling of truth behind their central idea.

One of the interviewees states resolutely that ""there are peaceful and moderate Muslims, but no peaceful and moderate Islam."" After watching Islam: What the West Needs to Know and witnessing this subject thoroughly dissected for 98 minutes, audience members will find themselves struggling to disagree with the statement. Some viewers will walk away from the film shaking their heads in wonderment at what a terribly violent and unforgiveable religion Islam really is. Some may actively disagree with the film's main thesis, positing that the verses used were misinterpreted and the interviewees biased. Hopefully, though, most viewers will see the film as impetus to do research of their own into the subject, realizing that this isn't a passing topic that can be quickly swept under the rug. If nothing else, this film serves as a strong warning sign to keep yourself educated on difficult matters because some subjects are too dangerous to ignore.",1185235200,79,3479,5.057491289198606
2625324,3,B000H0UPKI,"The cover of this DVD looks like something a magician would use and true to its nature, there are tricks in it. It is the type of stuff that Germans made when they wanted to eliminate the Jews. They made all Jews look evil. Congratulations to Robert Spencer and his crew because he has come close to doing it with Muslims. I appreciate how he acknowledges that there are some peaceful Muslims, but says there is no peaceful Islam. I would like to ask Spencer and his posse what they would suggest we do with the 80% of Muslims who are peaceful? Ovens or Gas Chambers? I don't deny the fact that we have some nut jobs who claim to be following the correct Islam and this video has some of them. Those who were part of 9-11 committed double sins for killing innocent people and killing themselves. As far as these people are concerned, they consider Muslims who don't follow their ideology as apostates and worthy of death. This is not a new phenomenon as these type of Muslims have existed a thousand years ago and they went by the name Kharijites. The difference is that those Muslims were silenced and put in check by the majority. The reason why our modern day Muslim terrorists have not been put in check is because the majority of Muslims have no power. They are victims of colonialism and nationalism and are now living under corrupt governments. Just rulers ran the early Muslims and they were not separated like they are now. The recent conflict in Bosnia is an example of what I am talking about. Even though the Serbs were ethnically cleansing Muslims and Muslim women were being raped and Mosques were being blown up, there was no real outrage by the Muslims worldwide. The same is happening with terrorism in the name of Islam and it will come to an end when Muslims are truly united.

The idea that the peaceful passages are superseded or abrogated by all violent passages based on the verse 2:106 is ridiculous and absurd. This accusation rests on the belief that once the Prophet was in Medina, he was no longer peaceful. The verse 8:61 says ""If your enemy inclines towards peace, you must also incline towards peace."" This verse was revealed while in Medina after the first Battle between the Meccans! The verse 2:256 was also revealed in Medina and it says there is ""no compulsion in religion.""  The revelations in the Quran are not exactly the same as the ones in the Bible but the core of the message of Truth is the same. Remember that from the Muslim perspective, the Bible was originally written by Allah (God) until some serious editing took place. The reason behind this verse is to explain that although the form of the message has changed and it differs as it was with earlier Prophets like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, the eternal principle is the same and never changes. Allah replaces the message with a better one, not a verse with a better one. This is an example of taking verses out of context and giving them your own meaning.

The last thing I want to mention is the so-called verse of the sword: 9:5  ""But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them."" While we are at it, let also mention another verse in the same chapter 9:29 which says ""Fight those who believe not in God nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by God , even people of the book, until they pay the Jizya."" So Spencer says that these verses are threats to Jews and Christians of 2007. That's interesting considering what the fist verse of the chapter says,
9:1 ""Freedom from obligation (is proclaimed) from Allah and His messenger toward those of the idolaters with whom ye made a treaty.""

Where is the treaty that has been made with the Americans? The Europeans? Where is the treaty that has been made with any Christian or Jew alive today? There is none so claiming this is a threat to all Christians and Jews is nonsense.  These verses along with other verses that talk of fighting for God are examples for future Muslims to take heed from. Case and point of this is in verse 4:74 which says,"" Whoever fights in the cause of God, then gets killed, or attains victory, we will surely grant him a great reward."" An Islamaphobe will see this and say Islam is a religion that worships death but the very next verse says:
 ""Why, then, should you not fight in the cause of God and of oppressed, helpless men, women and children, who cry out: `O Lord! Bring us out of this land whose people are oppressors, and appoint for us from Your Presence a protector, and appoint for us from Your Presence a helper!'""

 Unless you are blind or arrogant, you should see that Islam stands for justice the same way that the U.S.A. once stood for justice in the world and if you think otherwise, you are being fooled. Islam, according to the Quran and Sunna, is not violent towards innocent people but it is violent against those who represent evil and that is what every verse in the Quran which calls for fighting the unbelievers stands for. That is the only jihad allowed, in defense of the helpless and oppressed and even while doing so, there are rules to follow such as not killing women, children, monks or destroying property or even trees. I recommend for those who are not biased to read Shattering the Myth by Bruce Lawrence and to watch the DVD Legacy of a Prophet, which was made right after 9-11 to see the side you didn't see in this video.",1184630400,13,5413,4.509683995922528

I suspect everyone who is viewing the religion of Al-Islam as a personal attack against humanity, should read a little about Colonialism.  Colonialism was and is based on Christianity.  All suffering nations and third world suffering countries are and can be traced to this.  Does this make it right for those fanatics who misinterpret Quran to harm innocent people? OF COURSE NOT.  Did it make it ok for those who killed millions of Black people during the KKK era of this country in the name of Christianity? NO.  Did it make it ok for Nazis to kill millions of Jewish people during the holocaust? Absolutely not. Lets talk about Darfur, the Sudan, Afganistan and the horrendous atrocities that are happening all over the globe.  They are all wrong and evil. My forefathers were bought to this country in the bowels of a boat, most of them died on the middle passage. I am a product of the ones that made it. They were taught according to the BIBLE that they were sub human, they were taught according the the BIBLE they were the cursed children of Ham. This is misinterpretations from your Bible folks.

2625330,5,B000H0UPKI,"A couple of years ago I decided I needed to become informed regarding Islam, so began. All told I guess I've read about 40 books and now have a pretty good idea about what it is. The first book I went out and bought and read, was the Koran, because I thought l may as well go to the source and get the info straight.

Contra earlier reviewers - `Ehab M. Omar ""Newman""', `Dr Saleem Ahmed', `Sky Lion ""SkyLion""' - reading the Koran did not convert me, nor was it a magic bullet, knock over evidence in favour of Islam. In fact, to quote Thomas Carlyle as quoted in the excellent book `Secrets of the Koran' by Don Richardson, the Koran is ""A wearisome jumble, crude, incondite [with] endless iterations [and] longwindedness...Nothing but a sense of duty could carry any European through the Koran.' And so it was with me. I slogged through it, not because it was brilliant, gripping, diverse literature - it most certainly is not, rather drab and uniform from beginning to end - nor because despite its hell fire and damnation on virtually every page, it had the ring of truth and the divine about it - it most certainly did not.  It is the most turgid, boring, incomprehensible writing I have ever read. And according to Richardson, it is even more incomprehensible in Arabic! It is more comprehensible in translation because at least in a translation, the translator tries to make what is being translated comprehensible! But then of course, a translation is not THE Koran, as only the Koran in Arabic - the holy tongue - is the Koran, so I never really read the Koran did I, and no one who does not know Arabic can do so!

(Saleem; where did you get that ridiculous statistic that 3 out of 4 people who read the Koran accept Islam? I'm sure that huge numbers of Westerners have read the Koran in the last few years, though have not been converted but repulsed by it. I imagine like me they read it so as to become informed.)

Well...in my reading I came to cut through all the baloney being put out by idiot PC Western leaders  who to this day keep assuring us that Islam is a `religion of peace', and that it is only a few disaffected Moslems who have hijacked the `great religion' who are a threat to the West. It became abundantly clear, that it is Islam itself, built on the explicit teachings of the Koran and Hadith's, and on the example of the Islamic `perfect man', Mohammed, which is the threat. 1400 years of these explicit teachings and example being followed has wreaked death, destruction, and slavery on an mind numbing scale, over vast areas. And today the same is occurring all around the world. When a bomb goes off somewhere, you can almost guarantee, 99 times out of 100, Moslems planted it.

The talk today about moderate/peaceful Moslems and radical/jihadist/terrorist Moslems, is I think a false dichotomy. Rather what you have are inconsistent Moslems and consistent Moslems - and the consistent, orthodox ones are the radicals/jihadists because they follow the Koran and example of Mohammed, and the others, for whatever reason, don't. The only place it appears you can have `reformist' Muslims is in the West because in Islamic countries, reformists end up dead as heretics. But then in the West you have the out-working of `taqiyya' - Muslim lying to further the Islamic cause. At the end of the day, can any Muslim in the West be trusted? With taqiyya as a Mohammed established/authorised doctrine, I don't see how they can be.

So...when I heard that `Islam: What the West Needs to Know', was available, I purchased it immediately, and it confirmed what I had already discovered. It is not entertainment, nor can be called a nice dvd, but never the less should be required viewing. It has no razzamatazz or glitz whatever, but is solid information from beginning to end. The jutaposition of Western leaders making their starry-eyed public statements, with blunt statements of Islamic authorties contradicting them was most enlightening. (Where do Western leaders get their information from? Muslims practising taqiyya?) The technical quality could be improved, but that should not get in the way, nor be allowed to. The content is clear and unemotional, coming from people who know the subject inside out. And, with it simply examining the actual words of Islamic authorities, and avoiding secondhand or adversarial sources, it plays the strongest hand possible. I highly recommended it.

(I would suggest to the makers of it - perhaps they are already planning or working on this - that they put out a second version with upgraded illustrations and more of them. When anything can be illustrated it should be. This would make it more accessible for more people and be more visually interesting.)",1183852800,9,4725,4.760683760683761

2625335,5,B000H0UPKI,"As I looked through my journal to find my original review of this movie, I realized that it was exactly one year ago today that I first saw it! I was fortunate to catch it in its limited run here in Chicago.

My first reaction was that it was dry, as it is mainly people speaking, interspersed with clips here and there. Upon further thought I realized this was a wise move on the part of the filmmakers. No one can accuse them of sensationalism!

Here is a film that shows people speaking about Islam. Some are former Muslims, so they know what they are talking about. Others (such as Robert Spencer and Bat Yeor) have studied Islam for years. One speaker, Walid Shoebat, was not only a Muslim, but a terrorist as well. What better person to be able to speak to the motivations of terrorism, than one who was personally involved?

This movie goes into detail about Islamic teaching in regards to unbelievers and jihad. This is a quiet movie, a thoughtful movie. Most important of all, it is a movie based on their own teachings, showing some of their own people.

Watch it for yourself. Look up the various passages they mention for yourself. And then decide whether what is being said here is true or false.

2625337,5,B000H0UPKI,"This film portrays the problem with Islam extremely well and puts it in an accurate historical and theological setting. It bases its information on primary sources including the Bukhari ahadith which are considered by Muslims themselves to be the most reliable accounts of the life of Muhammad.

Importantly we hear the religion described by its own texts and followers - or previous followers - and the viewer then makes up their own mind on the issues (one quote of Muhammad's that I wish had been included are his last words from his death bed: ""I have been made victorious through terror"", which explains a huge amount in a nutshell). It is most definitely not ""Islamophobic"" and further research of the contributors will back this up - they have a genuine concern for Muslims.

Through this film I have been introduced to the works of Hillaire Belloc (early 20th C. Catholic historian) & Bat Ye'or (a contemporary Jewish Egyptian/French scholar), which I have found most illuminating, and to the jihadwatch website which is now essential daily reading for me.

We really do stand at the dawn of a new age and it is no exageration to compare the rise of ""fundamentalist"" Islam with the threat of Nazism & Communism. Given the fact that the most respected American historian in Islam has said that Europe will be subsumed as part of a ""western Islamic bloc within this century"" we all need to see this documentary in order to understand what that will probably look like.

Be warned, the film is quite slow, however I believe this is done in an effort to avoid emotionalism and I vouch that the film, nevertheless, will hit home as hard as anything most of us have seen.

I honestly cannot think of a more important film available today. If you can rouse yourself from the activity and fatigue of modern life for long enough to watch this documentary on those who have declared war on us you will never be the same again.",1183680000,56,1924,4.6973293768546

2625339,5,B000H0UPKI,"I have just watched this DVD for the second time.  It is loaded with pithy, essential material that should knock your socks off.  It presents brilliant speakers discussing Islam, and their statements are interwoven with television footage from the Middle East, the U.K., and the United States.  Relevant quotations from the Qur'an and from the canonical Islamic traditions appear on screen at just the right moments to illustrate points.

The speakers possess an extraordinarily in-depth knowledge of Islam's documents, its history, and its modus operandi, and discuss questions on the minds of increasing numbers of Westerners today: how do Muslims resolve the contradictions between peaceful and violent verses in the Qur'an?  What is the Qur'an's famous verse of the sword?  Is it true that, while there are moderate Muslims, there is no moderate Islam?  What does the Qur'an say about Muslims deceiving non-Muslims?  Does the Qur'an forbid Muslims to befriend Jews and Christians except deceptively?  Is there a clash of civilizations?  Is Europe going to be Islamized in a generation, as the Muslim population of Europe continues to grow by leaps and bounds through rapid immigration and high reproductive rates, while non-Muslims reproduce below replacement rates?  Is Islamic law in any way compatible with Western social systems?  Is it the case that Islamic law forbids Muslims to compel non-Muslims to convert to Islam, but commands Muslims to fight until all humankind submits to rule by Islamic law?  These and a number of other questions critical to understanding what the future may hold are illuminated.

One of the speakers is Walid Shoebat, a former Muslim and a former PLO terrorist.  Another is Robert Spencer, author of many books about Islam.  He is also the head of jihadwatch.org, appears on numerous television news shows and radio shows, has been studying Islam for decades, and has recently begun a brilliant weekly internet Qur'an class, where he has been explaining the Qur'an verse by verse, and then answering questions about the Qur'an from commenters.  Like others who have dared to reflect critically on Islam, Spencer receives numerous death threats and must conceal where he lives.  Bat Ye'or is another scholar featured in this DVD.  She is famous for several books that virtually created a new field of research: the study of ""dhimmitude."" Dhimmitude refers to the varying forms of second class status of non-Muslims living under Islamic law in various parts of the world during the course of history.  The other two speakers on this DVD, Abdullah Al-Araby and Serge Trifkovic, also have fascinating things to say.

In this DVD there is no nudity, no obscenity, and no violence.  But some of the television footage showing what some Middle Easterners say when they think Westerners are not listening will stand your hair on end.  For example check out the Muslim preacher who brings an Iraqi crowd to its feet as he draws a long scimitar from its sheath and screams with a diabolically charismatic fury, all while quoting early Islamic traditions about killing Jews.  The sound quality of his voice is distinctly reminiscent of Hitler's diabolically furious rants to huge crowds.  This and some of the other footage is astounding, and provides a powerful counterpoint to the very clear statements by the speakers.

I can't recommend this DVD highly enough as a way to learn a number essential facts about Islam's past, present and possible future.",1183680000,84,3484,5.154804270462633

What people need to understand is that the reason there are no 'moderate' Muslims speaking out against terrorism and atrocities committed world wide by those who follow Islam is because if they are not also committing these acts of jihad or supporting those that do, they are not truly 'good' Muslims as defined in the Quran.  The people everyone wants to call 'radicals' or 'extremists' are in fact, just practicing the true words of Muhammed in the Quran.  The Quran is a confusing book and once you understand how it is to be read (oldest passages are completely superceded by all later passages), then one comes to understand that any peaceful writings in the Quran were all very early and have since been replaced with the later chapters which are all entirely violent, preach intolerance and killing of all kaffur or infidels (those who are non-Muslim) and that the whole purpose of Islam is to be the one and only religion.  This is the ONLY religion in the world which has a penalty of death for leaving!  Does this sound peaceful?  Did anyone stop to think how, why and what kind of person would willingly 'martyr' their children, sending them out to die just to kill others they deem unworthy?  For most of us it is inconceivable.  This film will show you how they come to be so passionate about death to the infidels that it is worth killing their own children.  This is NOT biggotry.  Islam is truly not a religion.  It is a military organization with a political ideology and until the western world stops allowing it protection under our laws of freedom of religion, they will continue to infiltrate every aspect of our life, using our own laws protecting freedom, at the same time, using these laws to restrict our own freedoms, whilst they gain more and more.  Already, one cannot say 'merry Christmas' but tax payers are now financing footbaths and special rooms for prayer at public schools!  The Muslims are demanding not just 'rights' but being allowed to trample ours (and I'm not a Christian, but I clearly see this as WRONG).

2625346,5,B000H0UPKI,"Today's politically-correct orthodoxy, among both liberals and conservatives, holds that Islam is a beautiful religion a ""religion of peace"" which has been ""hijacked"" by extremist fanatics who abuse the doctrines of the Muslim religion to further an irreligious agenda. Pure Islam, it is said, is one of the most tolerant religious systems of the planet.

I actually agree with that last statement. Pure Islam is peaceful, even egalitarian--Islam, that is, which is purified from the doctrines of Muhammad!

The fact of the matter, in all seriousness, is that nearly every barbarity we in the Judaeo-Christian (and post-Christian) West identify with the Muslim world has its origins in the teachings of historic, orthodox Islam, as explicated by the Prophet Muhammad in the Quran, the various Hadith (oral traditions committed to writing which contextualize the surahs of the Quran), and the sira (early, authoritative Muslim biographies of the Prophet). The founder of Islam was a pedophile, a rapist, and a warmonger.

Indeed, those who are ""abusing"" and ""corrupting"" Islam are--thank goodness!--the true reformers (few though they are) who are working hard to alter the fundamental doctrines of Islam (such as jihad, sharia, and dhimmitude) which perpetuate barbarities such as religious persecution, misogyny, and aggressive warfare on the part of Muslims and the countries they hail from.

As Robert Spencer puts it: ""While there are certainly peaceful Muslims, there is no such thing as a peaceful Islam."" (That's a rough quotation.)

This documentary is relatively thorough, and provides the viewer with documentation. I encourage all viewers to research the work done by those experts interviewed in this documentary, to find the doctrines and history of orthodox Islam further documented. I am no scholar of Islam, and I do not read Arabic. But I know how to read, process information, double-check the primary source material, and come to a rational conclusion.

2625353,5,B000H0UPKI,"`What part of the word ""kill"" do you not understand?'  This is the question asked at large by former PLO terrorist turned Christian Walid Shoebat. He and Islamic expert Robert Spencer and others present compelling evidence that the goal of Islam is world domination and death to those who do not submit. They present surahs from the Koran, the sacred scriptures of Islam, as well as quotes from the Hadith, the life and sayings of the Prophet Mohammed, the duel foundation books for Islam.  They point to the centuries of Islamic violence on the rest of the world in the name of Allah, finally stopped and pushed back outside of Vienna on September 11, 1683.  The jihad was re-started 300+  years later on our September 11 when the U.S. was attacked by Bin Laden's suicide bombers.

Meanwhile, we hear President Bush, Secretary of State Condi Rice, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair giving sound-bites in this DVD about how tolerant and peaceful Islam is `except for the extremists'. This DVD says that all the true followers of Islam, not just extremists, are called to acts of violence in the name of Allah.  The moderates, per the DVD, are portrayed as misled since the more recent war-like quotations of Mohammed `abrogate' the corresponding early more-peaceful quotations of Mohammed.  They say the Prophet's sayings became more war-like as his power grew and he had more freedom to speak his mind.  We are told that it is honorable to lie in the name of Allah if it is for his cause, the expansion of his religion. Further, it is deemed honorable to die for the cause even if though suicide is forbidden; in fact it is the only sure way to heaven for a Moslem. This doctrine is even taught to grammar school kids as a long-range recruiting tool; this is illustrated by disturbing footage of children calling-in and offering future suicide services to the cause of Islam.

The film ends with an Iranian cleric, wielding a long sword, screaming `jihad' over and over again to an adoring, screaming mob of his followers.  It reminded me of Adolf Hitler mesmerizing his followers in the 1930's.

I would have sincerely liked to have heard opposing points of view, maybe some reasonable explanations of the issues raised here (if any exist) and that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.

2625359,5,B000H0UPKI,"These are some of the many arguments the film makes:

1. Islam is a state FIRST, and a religion SECOND, e.g., the goal of Islam is not to make everyone a Muslim, but to force everyone to live under Islamic RULE.  Nonbelievers, e.g., Christians, Jews, etc., in countries under the rule of Islam live in second-class status, and must pay a special poll tax, and so on, and face strict discrimination, e.g., traditionally, new Christian churches could not be built in Muslim lands, and existing ones were not allowed to be repaired, dooming the Christian communities in Muslim lands to a perpetual state of decline.  Another example: under Islamic law, it is against the law to leave Islam and join another religion such as Christianity, because it is an act of treason (punishable by death) against the Islamic state.  In that regard, one of the most influential Muslim scholars of the 20th Century, Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi, said, ""If Islam is truly a 'religion' in the sense that religion is understood at present, surely it would be absurd to prescribe the penalty of execution for those people who wish to leave it."" Then he said, ""When we present our arguments to demonstrate the validity of this punishment, we have in view no mere 'religion' but a state which is constructed on a religion."" The Islamic calendar does not begin with the date of Mohammed's birth, or when he got his first revelations from Allah, as we might expect of a religion, but when he moved from Mecca to Medina, and became the head of state.  Thus the ""separation of church and state"" in Islam is not only unthinkable but HERETICAL.  This point resonated with me because a Muslim once told me that he doesn't even like to think of Islam as a religion, it is so much MORE than that.  And recently I read the following quote from a pilgrim on the Hajj in late December, 2006 (Kuwait Times) which really illustrates the DVD's point of Islam as a state or nation:

Mohamado Thiam, a telecoms engineer from Senegal, said pilgrims were praying for Muslims in hotspots around the world. ""I'm very happy, look how our nation is expanding,"" he said.

2. The film says that Islam is a religion that mandates violence against unbelievers.  It argues that while there are indeed many peaceful, moderate Muslims who wouldn't hurt anyone, there is no peaceful and moderate Islam.  That is why it is very difficult for moderates to stand up within the Muslim community itself (not necessarily before infidels on American TV) and say that violent acts in the name of Islam are not Islam.  The film notes that, in the Quran, Allah allows verses of the Quran that came later in time to abrogate or void earlier ones.  The film argues that religious scholars of Islamic jurisprudence in the Middle East, whether in Jerusalem, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and so on, UNANIMOUSLY agree that ""the verse of the sword,"" i.e., ""kill the unbelievers wherever you find them . . ."" voids all the peaceful verses, such as ""Let there be no compulsion in religion,"" because it came after the peaceful ones chronologically. [The Quran, I should point out, is not arranged chronologically, but from the longest chapter to the shortest.]

3. In the religion, Mohammed is viewed as the perfect man that all Muslims must strive to emulate.  The film has some disturbing quotes from the sacred texts of Islam by Mohammed, e.g., he said that no one who died and went to heaven and experienced it would want to come back here again for all the world and everything in it, ""except the Martyr, who, on seeing the superiority of Martyrdom, would like to come back and get killed again in Allah's cause.""  The film also quotes an authoritative Islamic text that says that Mohammed married a six-year-old girl, and consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old.

But the film is not a boring ""study of text,"" e.g., it has some video from Middle East TV, including a chilling call-in show, where a 12 year old with a child's voice calls in and says he reads the Koran every day and wants to be a Jihadi and kill Jews and infidels, and the moderator, all condescending smiles (as an adult is with a child), ends the call by blessing the youngster and saying that he hopes that the boy will grow up to become a jihadi warrior some day. The moderator's whole attitude reeks of ""Oh the darling young boy.""

These are but a few of the many points, and the other ones are equally impacting and interesting, especially the section on the expansion of Islam throughout history, and in our time.  I highly recommend this DVD!  It is very informing and so interesting.",1167177600,45,4614,4.672839506172839

2625362,3,B000H0UPKI,"It is very easy to criticize the religions of other cultures, as this documentary does of Islam, but certainly this is a cowardly act. It is much braver to criticize the religion of ones own culture than that of another. In this case it should be the job of moderate Muslims to criticize the violent aspects of their religion just as it should be the job of the west to address the inherent anti-Gay and anti-Semitic aspects of Christianity. The audience for this documentary is misplaced.

That being said, this documentary does point out some obvious contradictions and a seemingly underlying theme of violence within the Hadith and the Quran; however, outside of the Quranic verses almost all of the evidence presented is anecdotal, highly subjective, and debatable. In particularly, the brief critique of Edward Said's book `Orientalism' that is depicted as an Islamic apologist in academia that has clouded western scholars from seeing the dangers of Islam. However, the authors must realize that Said was a Christian, not Muslim, and that Orientalism is about the lens in which we view the Middle-East in general not about making excuses for Islamic expansion.",1166486400,13,1166,5.072916666666667

I strongly recommend that you acquire this DVD or, at least, find a way to see it in its entirety.

The transnational conglomerates that direct the policies of the West are pushing ""neoliberal"" economics that are advanced by violence.  To avoid this reality, the victims of that violence are portrayed as the actual ""evil-doers.""  But for those who are interested in facts, they don't have to research very hard to realize that it is Western-based corporations that have a ""violent, expansionary ideology that seeks to conquer any contradictory religion, culture, and, ultimately, government.""  Hence, the long history of the West invading countries in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa.  The West has a habit of colonizing those it deems inferior, and even committing genocide against them as in the case of Native Americans, some African tribes, and indigenous people throughout Latin America who stand in the way of mining, timber and oil development (ecocidal projects that are defined as ""progress"").

Willam Blum's ""Rogue State"", the DVD ""Why We Fight,"" magazines like ""Z,"" and websites like Amazon Watch"" will give people plenty of information about how their society is the aggressor in the world.  Sadly, most people don't want to face that reality.  So, they'll just go on being ""good Germans"", or, using the current term, ""great Americans"" (ie. Sean Hannity and his willfully-ignorant listeners).

What a wake up call! There are no visuals frills, just straight forward interviews with credible insiders and a genuine presentation of texts pulled directly from the Q'uran with examples of how the texts have been used to perpetrate & validate voilence against western cultures and Jews. And all those who ""the peaceful"" religion of Islam considers infidels.  There are shocking scenes from inside the mosques where Islamic leaders spew vile chants encouraging fellow muslims to denounce the infidels... Including voilent verbal assaults identifying jews and westerners as dogs and pigs, and encouraging their decapitation - followed of course by ""praise be to Allah""!  In addition this documentary chronicles the century's old desire of the muslim community to take over and defeat all outside threats to their ""peaceful religious exsistence"". Something they have slowly but surely been succesful at in Europe already - look at the muslim community's rise in France (2005 violent muslim street protests) or England (where the politically correct Police force must now notify a panel Muslim Religious leaders before conducting terror raids - effectively tipping off the bad guys) and the negative affect it's had on their social wellbeing. After watching this film, you have no choice but to recognize that you turn a blind eye to Islamic fascism at your own civilization's peril -  as the film clearly illustrates, these people know nothing but domination through violence, and they teach it to their children from the moment they are capable of speaking and understanding. The film shows shockingly candid scenes of very young children on Muslim TV talk shows, denouncing people of other faiths as animals, as the adults smile and nod in proud approval.

When I broached the subject of the Muslim-Christian war in his birth country, he taught me something I'll never forget.

My interlocutor told me that he himself was Lebanese-Christian, but had plenty Lebanese-Muslim friends.  One could discuss most any subject with these Lebanese-Muslims, and engage in a mutually-satisfying exchange of reasonable, rational viewpoints.  However, if the subject touched on religion, Muslims -- no matter their level of formal education, high vocation or rarefied station in life -- would invariably revert to 12-year-olds, defending with fanaticism crazy, irrational, and even inhuman and inhumane (by Western contemporary standards) notions of morality and religion.  Since 9/11, I myself have seen this phenomenon over and over again.

It is about time that the talking-heads of the media, as well as American politicos of all stripes, learn about Islam.  This film is perfect for the job.  In fact, all Americans should see this film.

As much as most Americans want to believe that ""all religions are more or less the same"", they had better awaken to the shocking truth that it just ain't so.  This documentary film puts to rest the Big Lie of the early 21st Century, namely that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.

I highly recommend it to all people - Muslims who have not been disciplined enough to read and understand the Koran properly for themselves, as well as people of other faiths.  I really learned a lot.  The doctrine of abrogation is quite key - the fact that verses in the Koran revealed later chronologically nullify earlier verses if they contradict.  Many of the peaceful verses in the Koran are nullified by later verses which command the Muslim to literally kill unbelievers.  Another key fact I learned was that the Suras (chapters) in the Koran are not organized chronologically as one might expect, but they are organised from largest chapter to the smallest.  This one fact could lead an ignorant person to belive the more peaceful verses, some of which are found towards the end of the book, are the later versus, but this is not so - the exact opposite might be true.

I found the presenters VERY credible, VERY honest & sincere, VERY well informed, having taken exceptional care to document extensively & accessibly from Koran and the Hadiths---which they say are the two foremost texts which are binding before and beyond all other variables.  I'm possitive there's more which should fairly be considered---*BUT*---this presentation finally allowed me to grasp ISLAM'S DEADLY & MERCILESS OBLIGATION TO CONVERT OR AT MINIMUM SUBJUGATE ALL HUMANITY---MURDEROUSLY AS DEEMED 'NECESSARY'.",1486166400,,1261,5.783783783783784

8135804,3,B000H0UPKI,"While the producers and the speakers have very valid concerns, they are more informed about some details than Muslims are. And thankfully very few humans follow any doctrine to its letter. Case in point: how many human beings break the speed limit?!?
But on a serious note, the intention of the writers and producers is to make people aware of what has been written so that people can be responsible and safe. And pointing out what they do in the documentary could be helpful ""if"" it's listened to as something for which we can be responsible. If we listen to the documentary from a position of fear then we will only take actions that will actually cause the doctrine to be read by everyone and then followed by some causing the exact results the producers wanted to avoid in the first place.",1468713600,,793,4.591549295774648
