8661086,5,B00KS37I4K,"An excellent living history series that makes a rapidly receading time real again.  This series deals with something rarely shown on film, the home front in Britain.",1516924800,,165,5.111111111111111
8661087,5,B00KS37I4K,Absolutely riveting program that seamlessly blends history with farming challenges. I am having my whole family watch it with me so we can discuss it together. Don't miss it.,1510704000,,174,5.0344827586206895

8661089,5,B00KS37I4K,"What a great series! Will probably teach homesteaders very little, but for a city boy who never actually had to do any of farming, animal caring, off-grid living - this is an eye opener. What a hard life is this! I believe of people that think they can survive on a homestead and live self-sufficiently less than 1% can actually do it, including myself. This video provided me with a much needed reality check. I have to re-think my long term strategy.",1464048000,6,452,4.524390243902439
8661090,5,B00KS37I4K,"I have seen every single ""farm"" series they have ever done. I LOVE Ruth Goodman... I am such a nerdy fan-girl. She's my total SHE-RO. The work they put into these series and the living history these guys are exploring -- there's no true value you can apply to it because it is priceless. These videos are helping to catalog and preserve knowledge on the brink of extinction. Fascinating from start to finish. If you haven't seen the other series you should get them also. You will not be disappointed.",1456704000,8,501,4.5777777777777775
