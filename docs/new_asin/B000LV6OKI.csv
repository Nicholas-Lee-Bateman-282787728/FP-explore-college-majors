2714518,3,B000LV6OKI,"c'est une excellente ide de nous offrir ces deux versions de La Cerisaie
dans la premire, Judi Dench joue le rle de la jeune Ania
dans la deuxime, plus rcente, c'est elle qui joue le rle central
cela fait de ce DVD un objet historique fascinant",1228003200,4,244,4.326086956521739
2714519,2,B000LV6OKI,"I'm also a big fan of Judi Dench and I do not fault her acting in either of these productions, I watched both. I prefer the 1981 version, which is strange for me because I always prefer an older version of almost anything but the 1962 version was lifeless although I enjoyed Judi as Anya better then the Anya in the newer version . Also the sound was not very good on this DVD.
This was my first Chekhov play and I guess his writing is not up my alley! (sorry Chekhov fans)
I agree with the reviewer who said the story plot was hard to follow, dry, and DULL.",1197504000,7,558,4.081818181818182
2714520,5,B000LV6OKI,"The cast in both versions handle Chekhov's material with the utmost care. The direction in the 1962 M. St. Denis version is rather beautiful. One can't really go wrong with a cast like Gielgud, Ashcroft, Dench, Tutin, etc. They all just give the most stunning performances of this material.  Chekhov is actually incredibly timeless, and the cast is absolutely thrilling to watch. Richard Eyre's 1981 version is a bit more stoic, but his choice to bring Judi Dench on as Mdme. Ranevsky was like finishing a luxurious necklace with the Hope Diamond.  Judi Dench has the unbelievable ability to let a story and character filter through herself like an incredibly adept translator. Both of these versions are magical. The more theatrical version of 1962, and the ""made for film"" version of 1981. Both should not be missed, if even only for the experience of the remarkable performances, but certainly for the well handled telling of the genius Chekhov.",1183939200,29,948,4.993670886075949
2714521,5,B000LV6OKI,"Watching Judi Dench play Anna in the earlier production and then Madame Ranevsky twenty years later offers an opportunity to see a good actor become great. Her mature skills are extraordinary, but her ability twenty years earlier to play with such art is truly amazing. Also, each production of The Cherry Orchard is great, entirely worthy of Chekhov's greatest play.",1178928000,15,367,5.133333333333334
2714522,3,B000LV6OKI,"As an avid collector of Judi Dench movies, etc. I was very let down. There was so much hype in advertising this, I couldn't wait to see it. After receiving the DVD's we had to watch them three times before we could make any sense at all of them.  Here you have the Stage Play, both the Originial and the New Version. I don't want to critique too strongly, I love theatres and stage Acting, going to broadway shows, but this reminded me of a night we went to a small town Community Theatre, and left half way thru the show. (( Please don't Misunderstand, it was really  bad, others left also, I Love going to Community theatres ))

I am not critiquing the Actors and Actresses, but the original Dry, Dull, Not Interesting, Yet Complicated Story Plot, which was very hard to follow.  If a friend asked my opinion, I would tell them to look at a rental before they decide to buy it.",1178928000,6,879,4.3090909090909095

8164396,1,B000LV6OKI,"Instead of a 2-disc set of the 1962 and 1981 Cherry Orchards, my package contained a disc of a Bruins game instead of the 1962 Gielgud dvd.",1478304000,,139,4.185185185185185

8164399,3,B000LV6OKI,"A solid production, but not the best I've seen. The costumes in the 1960's version are awful, but the one's from the 1980's version are beautiful.",1401494400,,146,4.653846153846154

8164401,5,B000LV6OKI,I purchased this DVD set to use in my sophomore English class where we studied this classic.  Such a great idea:  the 1962 version with Judy Dench as young Anya...plus the 1981 version with Dame Dench playing Mama.  Wonderful addition to my curriculum.,1353801600,3,252,4.813953488372093
8164402,5,B000LV6OKI,"Can't imagine any admirer of great, great acting or of Chekhov could get through life without this double header.  Put watching it on your list of things to do every year.",1330560000,,171,4.516129032258065
8164403,5,B000LV6OKI,"The two productions of The Cherry Orchard, last play written by Chekhov, presented in this DVD: the first one, by The Royal Shakespeare Company (1962) and the second, by BBC (1981)are a blessing to those who love theater.  It's interesting to compare the way the productions dealt with the text and the great number of characters on stage,(Once upon a time, it was possible to do so) in a gap of almost twenty years of technology. We are talking about a play performed to a TV audience, anyway. It's also an opportunity to observe the peculiarities of the performances of each actor/actress. The way each one creates his/her own character.  The black and white version - that could bore us - on the contrary exactly for being less distracting, highlights the performances.
It's a pleasure to see Dame Judi Dench as a beautiful young lady in her twenties giving her first steps in what would be a great career, showing from the beginning the same dramatic vigour that characterizes her. Late, already a more mature actress, she comes out with this rhythm of her, a balance between inner and outer strengh of saying things, a gift of telling much with less or no effort.  Beautiful indeed! As a bonus, a very good interview she gave to Richard Eyre, the 1981's version's director.  I wonder if someday we could have a series like this here in Brazil.",1271808000,,1348,4.6991525423728815
8164404,5,B000LV6OKI,"This video is a joy if you love British theatre, which I do. It is also wonderful to see how incredible an actress Judi Dench was in 1961, and her further development in 1982. She has always been and continues to be brilliant. It is also interesting to see how changes were made to update the vocabularies used in the two performances, and the differences in interpretations of roles in the play by the various actors.",1242259200,2,418,4.5131578947368425
