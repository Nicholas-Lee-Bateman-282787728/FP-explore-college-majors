7781115,5,B01H7J6JCE,"I love fireplaces!!! Three discs...wow!  Each disc has 2 fireplace choices and all can be played with fireplace sounds as well as music.  I usually want the fireplace sounds, there's just something to be said about a crackling fire.  I love how the fireplace scenes take up the whole TV screen yet have the full view of the bottom and top of the fireplace scenes.  Ready for winter weather so I can cozy up and feel warmer with the view and sounds of the crackle.  Love it!",1469664000,7,473,4.390804597701149

7781117,5,B01H7J6JCE,This Fireplace DVD was to give our christmas an old fashion feel. I no longer live in a home that has a fire place and wanted to get back some of that ambience. The DVD was absolutely wonderful and very realistic. We just loved it and I highly recommend this to all. It will be part of our Christmas every year from now on.,1483660800,2,323,4.0625

7781121,5,B01H7J6JCE,"Three different DVD's of a fire burning in a fireplace.  Each one offers the options to have the natural fire sounds (my preference!), or background music, or both.  It's like having a real fireplace, without the heat and the mess!  Especially nice for gatherings; the music and natural sounds background sound really warms up the room socially.  Definitely worth the cost!",1479513600,,373,5.065573770491803
7781122,5,B01H7J6JCE,These are delightful to watch.  We like the realism as the natural fires burn down over time.  We like the sound options also.  These 3 DVD's are a great value.  We can put them into TV sets in different rooms.,1478908800,5,210,4.175
7781123,5,B01H7J6JCE,"Vivid, and how! Ive been using my favourite fireplace DVD from this company for a couple of winters now (every night!). Last month I got a new TV with a higher resolution, and the old fireplace wasn't looking so sharp. So I tried this one, and what a difference! The fires really pop out! Highly realistic. And brighter, too, which really works on the new, sharp screen. Love the choice of classical music or the fireplace sounds, too. My wife especially likes to cozy up with me in front of the Chopin fire. :-) Oh yeah, three discs! I like getting more bang for my buck.",1478217600,2,572,4.40566037735849
7781124,5,B01H7J6JCE,"This DVD set has six different fire for selection. You have the choice between classical piano music and natural sounds of the fire. Normally I prefer the fire noise, but I also like the famous classical music very well here. These DVDs are a great alternative to a real fire. The crackling sounds of logs are so realistic that I have the feeling that I have a real fireplace and that I feel the heat. I also like observing the spraying of the sparks that can be admired up close here. With this DVD you can have a cozy evening at home.",1473984000,6,536,4.264705882352941
7781125,5,B01H7J6JCE,"Fireplace videos are amongst my favorites, right up there after nature ones.  This 3 DVD set has extremely sharply filmed fires, and I love listening to the crackling and popping of a real fireplace. The music on all three is really nice, but it doesnt beat the natural sounds of fireplaces. Since its summer, I don't ordinarily play fireplace DVDs now, I wait until its cold outside. Then I REALLY appreciate them. It almost makes you feel warmer. The photography is excellent and the fire covers the entire TV screen which makes it even better. It really looks like you're watching an actual fireplace in your house! Great DVDs!",1470528000,8,630,4.779816513761468

But it is a metal fireplace so you do have a bit of an echo, not the pure sound of a brick fireplace",1520467200,,115,3.64
