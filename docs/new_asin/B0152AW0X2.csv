8732363,5,B0152AW0X2,"In late 2015, journalist Martin Smith and a PBS filming team came to Syria to explore everything they could about life in territory controlled by Assad.  If you don't know anything about the Syrian civil war, you figure it out as you watch this documentary.  I knew the basics about Syria-Russia-Iran vs. radicalized rebel groups possibly allied with Saudi Arabia and the United States.  What's interesting in this is that it's so methodically done.  You just follow the steps of his journey and learn about how he got permission from state authorities to go to a different place to meet so-and-so.  Movement throughout the country is very restricted.  Most people in Damascus live like their world will not be touched, which could be a form of denial.  There are wealthy beach communities which have a Russian military presence and are getting overrun by refugees, and Assad tries to keep a good image so the international sanctions might be lifted, promoting culture and order.  He allows some degree of religious freedom, but not political dissent.  Many people who are in his political and military system just want order for the country and an end to the violence.  His massacres of the Syrian people are usually because of violent rebel groups in their midst.  His regime considers the US a threat, but the propaganda against the United States isn't to the level of demonizing which Iran does.  And let's not forget about the women who have lost loved ones who either died, were conscripted, or fled, and the children who are eager to get out of there before they get conscripted or blown up.  They get interviewed in this also.  I've had a curiosity for a long time to see what it is like in Syria, and this documentary really delivers on showing that.",1505606400,,1759,4.781456953642384

Those going into this documentary should be aware that it is named Assad's Syria for a reason. It is fascinating and has numerous views. The reporter/producer Martin Smith is very fair. But the restrictions placed on moving around the country limit his access to mainly one perspective with some small deviations. It is the regime side of Syria and it's people with which Smith is able to mingle and interview. This is still very valuable because we how everyday Syrians, and some famous ones, see their country and its leader. We see how they view the rebels, the extremists, and the foreign powers they believe are involved.

For this production, Martin Smith does not take sides, He simply allows those around him to express themselves and how they feel. We see the contrasts of how humans adapt to conflict and go on with their lives where possible. Syrians in safer areas still have a night life, they go to resorts, their kids play in the streets. For me it was particularly interesting to read between the lines because the documentary is limited by nature. You can see that Syrian society does have a secular side that just wants to be left alone to live life. There are soldiers openly enjoying a beer as Smith interviews them. Young 20's men and women intermingling at clubs. We are taken out to Alawite strongholds such as Tartus and Latakia to see resorts and people swimming in the ocean just like anywhere else. Refugees also stream there to flee more dangerous areas.

Conversely, they also go to checkpoints along frontiers where lines are drawn against groups like the Free Syrian Rebels, Al Nusra, and ISIS. We even see some snippets of aftermath in cities like Homs. However, any conflict footage is mainly borrowed from state representatives or from reporters that Smith encounters while he is there. He is not allowed to report on conflict as it happens and mainly is not involved in anything like that. The closest he is allowed to getting the non-regime perspective is an interview with a Syrian Army defector who went to the rebel side, then returned with a pardon from the Syrian government to fight with the army again. Smith openly states he was likely given that interview purposefully by the Assad regime. Nonetheless, it still provides some insight. In this one small critique, that is where I felt the documentary lagged a little into what I would call conflict tourism rather than meat and bones access. Again, this is not a critique of the reporter or the terrific value of the documentary. It's not his fault nor that of the production. I just want to be clear with prospective viewers so you know what is in this documentary and what is not.

I enjoyed the documentary greatly. I have a little experience in the region, mainly on the other side of the border. So for me the real value was to simply see the pro-regime people's side of life and how they feel about things. I didn't view this to judge either way politically. Just observe and listen. You may not learn much more about ISIS or even the Free Syrian Rebels. Maybe not much about average people who wish a different regime. But the complexity and difficulty of the situation is here to see. Some of the brutality on both sides as well. There is some graphic imagery and bloodshed for those who wish not to see such. Tragically, some involving children as well. However, I felt it didn't show quite as much as some documentaries I have seen.",1469836800,,3512,4.705691056910569
8732365,5,B0152AW0X2,"Well done documentary. It shows how life had been in Syria before the war started in 2011.
The normal life where people tolerate each other without paying attention to religious views, and are still relatively happy .. still exists in parts of the country controlled by Syrian Army. I am not going to reveal here who is responsible for the terrible fate of Syria... be your own judge.
Highly recommended!",1467244800,,404,4.785714285714286
