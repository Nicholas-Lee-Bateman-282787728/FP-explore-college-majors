8228442,5,B000XJ5TPO,I really liked this movie. It showed how the human spirit could overcome hatred and revenge to forgive. I wasn't surprised that Donny had gone to prison for Keith. Keith seemed like the hothead full of hatred more so than Donny. He got what he deserved in the end. It was great how Donny and Ossie protected Charlie in the end. George was a wonderful father and saw how revenge was hurting his son. Loved it and Rossif Sutherland.,1422316800,,430,4.455696202531645
8228443,5,B000XJ5TPO,This movie slipped under the radar when it was first released but because I make it a point to seek out lesser known films I stumbeled across this one. And I am greatful. This is an exceptional film one I've never forgotten. It's powerful and vicious but it's also painfully beautiful.,1350691200,,285,4.607843137254902
8228444,5,B000XJ5TPO,"An intense drama with suspense and lots of action. The intriguing story portrays tragedy, a great desire to seek revenge, and the trials-and-tribulations of growing up in a society where trouble is all around. The story is thrilling, yet heart-wrenching as the innocent suffer and the guilty is convicted, but the issue continues in a battle for revenge before forgiveness becomes a plea. Acting Performance is Superb, the story grabs your attention, and drama is explosive. I would watch it again. Highly Recommended!",1341792000,,518,5.253012048192771
8228445,5,B000XJ5TPO,"If you like Boxing, this is the movie for you.  He came form the streets and worked his self up along with the help of Danny Glover to become a good boxer and protector.",1312761600,,169,3.9705882352941178
8228446,4,B000XJ5TPO,"This screenplay was brilliant, and the acting and directing were superb. Danny Glover proves himself here like never before. This movie was heartbreaking on many levels. Not really a boxing movie, but more of a study on what an extremely violent act can do to a community when it's time for retribution.",1287273600,,303,4.846153846153846
8228447,4,B000XJ5TPO,"After watching a few ""clunkers"" involving boxing, I'm glad I stumbled upon this little known film! Poor Boy's Game is a pleasant surprise as it really has nothing to do with boxing and everything to do with choices, forgiveness, remorse and redemption! The story is told simply, but the film is full of interesting and ""real"" characters. Which is always welcome to film lovers, who just want to see good stories told well! Rossif Sutherland (Donald's other son) gives a quiet, but solid performance.... ditto Danny Glover.

I know a lot of film lovers are tired of ""Hollywood"" type films, but studios make movies based on what sells. whether it's an ""over the top"" action movie, a manipulative romantic comedy or predictable thriller......even bloody gore / horror films are a bit ""Hollywood"" in this day, as it is so over done, it doesn't even shock us anymore. If we want to see better films being made, start paying to see films like this! It's well worth your time and it's got a wonderful message, we all need to learn! I caught this on cable, so I can not make any comments about the DVD release.",1223856000,3,1102,4.651282051282052
8228448,4,B000XJ5TPO,"POOR BOY'S GAME is a small film with much depth and insight made up of many quality parts.  Donnie played by Rossif Sutherland is  released from prison after 9 years served for the brutal beating of Charles Cavery.  Important here - Donnie white and Charles - black.  Racism on both sides is looked at in great detail here as is punishment and forgiveness/right and wrong.  Donnie's entire family and community try to tell him what to do and how to live his life.  The main character on Charles's side is his father played by Danny Glover.  For him, the black community tries to tell him what to do and how to feel/live.

Both Donnie and the father have minds of their own though and the characters of both are delved into at great length.  We get to explore all the aspects of Donnie right from his final days in prison.  We also learn much about Charle's father.  The other issues such as racism and revenge etc. are also looked into strongly but the glue to this film is the performances provided by Danny Glover and Rossif Sutherland.  They are both amazing and the relationship that develops between the two characters is both honest and heartbreaking.

The film is about boxing, being middle class and too many subjects to mention yet it manages to be a simple film with strong character studies and a big message.  I highly recommend this film.  The acting is of the highest caliber and you will go on an emotional journey not soon to be forgotten.",1223078400,,1455,4.542307692307692
8228449,4,B000XJ5TPO,"POOR BOY'S GAME is a little film with a big message: hate can only be altered with forgiveness, remorse and redemption. The highly respected Jamaican director Clment Virgo (episodes on 'The Wire', 'The L Word', 'Soul Food', and films 'Love Comes Down', 'Lie With Me', etc) here takes on the tough subject of racism and the accompanying backlash of consequences and with co-writer Chaz Thorne produces a small but pungent film that touches many aspects of the schism between whites and blacks in the seemingly tranquil town of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Isolating the story in such an unlikely place serves to heighten the core problems the film addresses.

Donnie Rose (Rossif Sutherland) is released from prison, having served nine years for the brutal beating of Charles Carvery (K.C. Collins) which left the victim severely brain damaged. Upon release Donnie returns to his old neighborhood to live with his mother and find work as a security guard in a bar. Largely due to the bad influence of Donnie's belligerent and bigoted brother Keith (Greg Bryk), Donnie has to struggle with his family situation, trying to avoid the pain and guilt of his past while coping with his own dark secrets. His victim's father George (Danny Glover) stalks Donnie with the intent of killing him for the damage he has inflicted on both his son and wife (Tonya Lee Williams): the racial tension he encounters magnifies the underlying tragedy of the past - a factor both Donnie and George must face. Violence between the blacks and whites erupts and the resolution is to be decided in a boxing match between the superior boxer Ossie Paris (Flex Alexander) and Donnie. After a touching encounter following a tragedy, George and Donnie bond and George trains Donnie for the fight, the first sign of erasing racial tension. How the crucial fight preparations proceed and how the fight results from the resolution of the critical conflict that has eroded the town and these people forms the surprising closure of this story.

The cast is strong with the quiet lead from Danny Glover and the smoldering, conflicted Donnie by Rossif Sutherland (the fine young Canadian actor whose father is Donald Sutherland and whose half brother is Kiefer Sutherland). The film very quietly explores other conflicts, such as Donnie's sexual and emotional life with his black cell mate in prison, adding to the exploration of human behaviors that influence interpersonal schisms and barriers. This may be a low budget movie but it is a solid work well worth viewing. Grady Harp, March 08",1204329600,7,2545,4.985882352941177
