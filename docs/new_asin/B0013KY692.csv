8251645,5,B0013KY692,"Informative, easy to follow (very well-organized, with chapters you can access individually if needed for later reference), with a professional look/feel and enjoyable, upbeat music. Friendly without attempts at cheesy humor; understandable to kids of probably 8 or so who want to learn, while not sounding overly-simple to adults. Promotion of certain products and brands (including Publix's own, of course) is actually handled rather tastefully and unobtrusively, allowing you to push the menu button on your remote if you want more info on a product mentioned, and if you don't push it they tend to move right on after a simple ""This stuff is good and meets your need"" sort of thing. Best of all for me, my 2-year-old absolutely loves watching the cat footage, of which there is a LOT; over 50 adopted cats are the stars of this video, not the people, and pretty much everything described by the people is demonstrated in action with the cats.",1426809600,,946,4.955974842767295
