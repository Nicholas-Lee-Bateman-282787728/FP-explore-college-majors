8214827,5,B000UUFROY,"Part of a transformational home study course! The practice of Qi Dao is not just another exercise program. It is a journey along the way of being free and natural. I knew from the first time I met Lama Tantrapa that what he had to offer was very different from anything I had ever experienced before. To my surprise, practicing Qi Dao has far exceeded my expectations. I now live my life with more joy, freedom, and excitement than I ever dreamed possible. If you take the time for yourself, as I did, and continue your exploration of Qi Dao, I'm certain it will transform your life and empower you to manifest your dreams.

8214828,4,B000UUFROY,"There doesn't seem to be a full description of this video, or Qi Dao for that matter - so to get a better idea of Qi Dao - visit the book page&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Qi-Dao-Tibetan-Shamanic-Qigong-The-Art-of-Being-in-the-Flow/dp/1434320278/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Qi Dao - Tibetan Shamanic Qigong: The Art of Being in the Flow</a>.  This DVD should accompany the book written in the same title.  You can mimic the movements and use the stretching demonstration easily enough by just watching - but this video is meant to augment or accompany the book.

This video is very straight forward - Lama Tantrapa is demonstrating to two other individuals and goes over all the postures and movements described in the book.  There are warm up demonstrations and stretching (range of motion exploration) procedures.  Stabilization and alignment / destabilization and misalignment are all demonstrated to show that the techniques can be applied immediately and built upon as your abilities expand.

What you will not find in this video is an extended demonstrative practice routine.  Everything is broken up into it's parts and shown separately.  Many people who purchase tai chi and qigong videos may expect their familiar format with music playing in the background - but the nature of Qi Dao and it's directional movements allows this video's unique (segmented) format to work very well.

There are a few applications of self defense technique where Lama Tantrapa demonstrates several methods (depending on direction/alignment) dealing with grabs that end in throws or 'shucks'.  There are also a few very short clips demonstrating Qi Dao in it's spontaneous form.

The video overall suits it's purpose - those who attempt to utilize the video without the book will may not rate as highly.  I'm giving 4 stars instead of five because  I would have liked to have seen more partner-based self defense applications, perhaps a  full, non-segmented practice routine would have been valuable, also more demonstration of the spontaneous movements within the Qi Dao structure.",1264118400,3,2115,5.527950310559007
8214829,2,B000UUFROY,This video is more of a marshal arts form than Qigong. It is hard to follow and requires a partner to do most of the moves since it shows you how to avert a blow or knock someone off balance. The quality of the video was also poor. If you are interested in Qigong looks somewhere else.,1240790400,14,285,4.017543859649122
8214830,5,B000UUFROY,"I found Qi Dao, Tibeten Shamanic Qigong to be a very thorough book that is easy to understand and follow.  I have taken classes from Lama for several years and have always been impressed with his knowledge and understanding of Qi Dao and also his ability to make classes fun, informative and creative.  His book is a great introductioin to Qi Dao.  The book does a great job of explaining the movements and principles of Qi Dao, with photos that make it even easier to understand and follow.  I think that anyone wanting to understand and experience Qi Dao will benefit from this book.",1239148800,2,585,4.596153846153846
8214831,5,B000UUFROY,"Tibetan Shamanic Qigong is just what I had in mind when I ordered this Video. Being able to work with direction and proper format is so important and so much better than just reading about the movements. Its indicative here that acttion is so much better than words.

WONDERFUL !!!",1202774400,5,281,4.62
