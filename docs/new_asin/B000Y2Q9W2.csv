8230927,4,B000Y2Q9W2,"This is a good movie about the pimp culture. Mack 10 does a good job in his role, as does Clifton Powell, and this film has an authentic feel to it. There are a plethora of real life pimps in this movie as well, so the slick talking and pimpery is real and not just for the cameras so to speak. The reason I'm taking off a star is that that the camera quality is poor. Almost to the point of being blurry. I've seen a number of independent movies and I've never seen a movie that had such poor viewing quality.",1500508800,,510,4.009803921568627

They should've used REAL PIMPS to STAR, or just put the money up for the Movie. But for the money if your into these types of Movies then this is one to add to your Collection.",1333497600,,290,3.693548387096774

8230934,2,B000Y2Q9W2,"I found this film to be more funny than anything, even though it was a drama. Anything glorifying the pimp game, especially when rappers try to do it can be hilarious. Katt Williams character as the MC in this movie was pretty funny. I guess you can say Mack 10 is running or done ran out of rhymes so now he's resulting to low budget films.",1237334400,2,341,4.181818181818182
