8556752,4,B00AR30HVM,"I bought this movie to see how  Victor McLaglen would do in a starring role as opposed to his usual supporting roles.  I knew it was a B grade movie so I did not have high expectations for the script.  I was pleasantly surprised both by McLaglen's performance and by the movie itself.  Both were very entertaining. The movie was a mixture of comedy and light drama.  McLaglen played McLaglen and did it well.  For someone who really didn't think much of  the profession of acting- he was prouder of his boxing career- Victor McLaglen proved himself more than capable of holding his own against any actor adult or child to include John Wayne, Shirley Temple, and in this movie Freddie Bartholomew. It's a fun movie to watch if you enjoy either Victor McLaglen as the big lug or  movies from the 1930's.",1408665600,5,801,4.5524475524475525
8556753,4,B00AR30HVM,"This is a lost gem. What makes this film is the relationship between Victor McLaglen and Freddy Bartholomew. For that alone it is worth viewing. Two things that should be noted is that when Victor handles the machine gun he actually did that in real combat. Also, the relationship between him and Freddy was real. He bought Freddy a pony after the film ended and they remained life long friends.",1397606400,4,395,4.6571428571428575

8556755,2,B00AR30HVM,"Sadly many of the Fox archive DVDs have been criticised for poor technical reasons.

This one, the print used is OK but in the transfer to DVD, a video drop-out line is visible, intermittently, across the centre of the picture. It doesn't make it unwatchable, but it is distracting and shouldn't be there.

I haven't watched the whole film, because of this, but it looks to be resonably entertaining.

Why can't they get these thing right????",1360108800,15,442,4.7894736842105265
