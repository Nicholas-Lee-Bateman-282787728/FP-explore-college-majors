8595388,5,B00DOII6ZQ,"A very entertaining and thrilling historical drama. Very good acting, well written and directed story with interesting characters and nail-biting plot twists . After the first episode the story starts rolling and you are hooked. This drama has delightfully high production values, the horribly tacky dvd cover does not give a realistic image of the drama at all.",1444780800,,362,5.258620689655173
8595389,5,B00DOII6ZQ,"Great historical drama and wonderful medical information for the naive. A bit graphic at times, but it is brief scenes of various medical operations or conditions, so it adds to the realistic value of the film.",1413158400,,210,4.861111111111111
