8215045,4,B000UV4BJK,"This isn't the best made horror film. The acting is weak and the script is awkward in places. But this film has something most don't--an inventive premise that will make true horror fans happy.

The protagonist is a pureblood vampire, who is being punished for her excessive ways. Vampires are a booming business, and converts are flocking to purebloods in hope of being turned. Problem is, these upstart converts don't know how to behave themselves. They dress goth, kill for the sake of killing--they don't get the vampire mystique.

It's a dry, dark comedy that will cheer, not offend, the most serious of horror fans. Oh, and--Amazon? It has nothing to do with volleyball. Please get the box art right! Thank you.",1289174400,,717,4.868852459016393
