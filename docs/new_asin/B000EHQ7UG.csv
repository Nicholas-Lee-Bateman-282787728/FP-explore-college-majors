2519118,5,B000EHQ7UG,What can I say? Chris Botti is a gifted musician that reaches those who love jazz and ballads. I was extra happy that Burt Bacharach was on this DVD as well.  I gave this to a neighbor and want to get another one for me.  I think this young man is one excellent trumpet player.  I also appreciate the people/talent he surrounds himself with.,1387497600,,341,4.296875

2519149,5,B000EHQ7UG,"This is an excellent recording of a great Chris Botti concert. The fact that Sting and others join him are like icing on a great cake. I thought his redition of ""My Funny Valentine"" was like watching someone make love with a trumpet. This is a terrific DVD and if you love to hear some of the old classics done differently, you will be very happy with this.",1366156800,,357,4.264705882352941
2519150,5,B000EHQ7UG,"Wonderful Simply Wonderful !!! This has to be one of the all time great evenings for being amazed at true talent. Chris Botti was blessed at birth. The man has a inner feel for his instrument that is unbelievable. Goosebumps, I tell you, Goosebumps and tears for the beauty of the music. Paula Cole will mesmerize you. A pure, perfect voice that compliments Chris Botti completely. All the artists involved in this evening are solid !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You must include this is your library of music, trust me.",1364169600,,512,4.885057471264368

2519153,5,B000EHQ7UG,"I have already bought three to give as gifts.  This music elevates our evening, our mood, and our appreciation of jazz, which we have not admitted to liking before.  Sadly, Botti never comes to Denver.  Just the orchestra alone is soooooo perfectly tuned in to what each selection should express.",1361577600,,296,4.88

2519206,1,B000EHQ7UG,"I guess it was my fault when ordering but I didn't know it was Blu-ray so I didn't play on my DVD unit hence the rating which I'm sure is way off base. I expected it to be at least a four star from me. I have the CD and have played it over and over again. Just wish it hadn't arrived as a Blu-ray. I really don't hate it as a DVD, just didn't have any other choice to write the review. If you have a Blu-ray, get it. I already know the music is great.",1356912000,,451,3.6597938144329896

2519209,5,B000EHQ7UG,"This is a brilliant performance.  Chris Botti is flawless, and the supporting musicians are excellent.  I especially enjoy James Genus on bass and Billy Kilson on drums.  The production aspects (lighting, sound, video, staging) are all excellent.  There are no flaws in this concert.  There is a nice mix of instrumental and vocal pieces.  Burt Bacharach and Paula Cole absolutely shine on The Look of Love.  If you've seen Chris Botti in Boston, this is equally good.  There are certain pieces that are stronger on both videos, but both are superb.",1321056000,,549,4.956043956043956
2519210,3,B000EHQ7UG,"I am not sure that Chris Botti bills himself as a jazz artist and so I simply accept his concerts as just that- ecclectic concert performances. And they are delightful. While this blu-ray issue has excellent audio the video is saturated in color. It's not terrible but it could have been better.

For the ultimate in blu-ray picture quality check out the 1964 British war movie ""Zulu"", filmed on location in South Africa. That is truly impressive-

2519211,2,B000EHQ7UG,"I don't have much to say other than I bought based on Home Theater magazine recommendation.  Pretty dull concert.  Too much formulaic Botti blowing long, sensitive notes, much like some concerts nod you out when everyone has their obligatory solo.  Well, Botti gets an obligatory blow every song.  A couple of the songs wake you up, but it's a lot of protocol and not enough emotion.  At least for me.  All that talent for guests and you never had a sense they jelled and jammed.",1289001600,,479,4.576470588235294

2519213,5,B000EHQ7UG,"If you are a fan on Chris Botti or if you just enjoy Jazz, the quality of his music and trumpet playing is excellent. His guests as usual are spectacular.  This is Jazz all throughout, beautifully performed, If  however you want a slightly more varied musical experience as a first exposure to Botti, get his performance in Boston.",1278115200,,331,4.689655172413793
2519214,5,B000EHQ7UG,"One of the best music DVDs I have ever purchased, especially for most of us Chris Botti & CO.  fans who were not fortunate enough to attend the live concert in Boston.  Highlights are  duets with violinist Micarelli and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. But don't forget to view the bonus track of Fragile.",1272153600,,290,4.538461538461538
2519245,5,B000EHQ7UG,If you haven't seen this you are missing out on the greatest music on DVD.  It's one of my favorites of all time.,1271808000,,113,3.9130434782608696
2519246,5,B000EHQ7UG,"There's a scene in Amadeus where Emperor Joseph II criticizes Mozart's work for having ""too many notes.""  Mozart defends that he believes his work has just the right number of notes, not too many or too few.  One gets the sense that had Emperor Joseph heard Chris Botti's performance on this DVD he would have complained it had too few.  Even Botti comments on a bonus interview that he is not an artist that floods a piece with ""a lot of content.""  ""I need someone to finish my phrases for me,"" he observes.  And that is what makes Chris Botti stand apart from the smooth jazz crowd.

Make no mistake, Chris Botti is a virtuoso - a young virtuoso, with so much potential it's frightening to think of where he'll be in ten years, or in five.  But he is a musician who understands, and exercises, the power of restraint, and that understanding shows up in spades on this video.  Surrounded by a world-class core band--Billy Childs (piano) and  Billy Kilson (drums) especially stand out--and a 50-piece orchestra of L.A.'s best session players, he plays just the right number of notes, leaving ample room for his band mates and guests to finish his musical phrases.

And what a parade of guest singers: Sting, Paula Cole, Jill Scott, Paul Buchanan, Renee Olstead, Gladys Knight all shine in the generous space created by the headliner.  As someone in the ""behind the scenes"" bonus documentary observes, Jill Scott doesn't merely channel Billie Holiday in her show-stopping performance of Good Morning Heartache, she's the second coming.  No wonder great singers flock to perform with Botti - by turning the spotlight on them he elevates the entire performance to new heights, and the glory reflects back on him.

Botti is the willing servant of the song, and freely acknowledges that the real stars on this recording are his three arrangers, who he introduces to the audience and gives due credit.  ""They're the cake, I'm just the frosting,"" he explains, comparing himself to Sinatra, who was wise enough not to get in the way of Quincy Jones' incomparable arrangements, but instead showed up after ""the cake"" had been backed to perfection to top it.

It's unfair to categorize Chris Botti as a ""smooth jazz"" musician in the same way that it is blasphemy to pigeon-hole Michael Franks in that class.  Both are simply musicians whose virtuosity and performances transcend efforts to label them.  Pop?  Jazz?  What does it matter what you call it when you can bring out and capture performances like this on film?",1267920000,,2509,4.806526806526806
2519247,3,B000EHQ7UG,"Whilst this dvd is quite enjoyable, full of great artists and vocal treats, why is it limited by the quality of soundtracks.

From the intimate interpretation of lyrics, to the dynamic backing band, and appreciative looks from the orchestra members, there is something for everyone. The sound is five-star, and pictures to match. Botti makes it look easy, but his incredible technique is an example to all brass players.",1265932800,,392,5.140625

2519250,2,B000EHQ7UG,"I'm stepping on the Blu-Ray field for the first time by reviewing this `Chris Botti Live', a typical program for those who don't have anything better to be served with considering a new and astonishing technology that seems to have become popular in recent years.

It is quite similar to the DVD launching decades ago but with a big difference: old programs, mainly Jazz programs, were relatively fast and successfully remastered into DVD format so that we could take advantage of watching the Jazz greats in high quality sound and image standards. It's also important to notice that many of our Jazz greats were still well and alive there to offer new products, new shows at that time.

It seems that Blu-Ray is somewhat more complicated to have old material to be converted into.

There seems to be also a problem with the material: what industry currently calls `Jazz' is a surprise I take as not agreeable. Where are the real Jazz greats? Maybe their programs could not guarantee a fat return to the producers ...

In this scenario, I was presented to Chris Botti and Mr Botti is introduced by our Amazon Editor as a Jazz chart-topping trumpeter. It's hard to swallow comfortably.

The show final results are spectacular as far as we get drunk by the notoriously splendid image and sound quality gathered with the extraordinary American industry's expertise to put things together in this kind of production. Theater is extraordinarily beautiful.

The audience is clearly a plethora of invited people among friends and fans, so enthusiastic was their reaction even in tender situations. Passed to me the idea that the audience'a aplause was orchestrated at some 'presset' times.

The trouble with me refers to the material. Please no Jazz is offered even with the great Gil Goldstein before a great orchestra and a rhythm section trio leaded by the great Billy Childs and by guitarrist Mark Whitfield.

The program is a beautiful collection of standards, just a few 6 songs having Mr. Botti as a lead soloist. This makes us suppose a long list of invited artists, featuring Sting and Gladys Knight.

Ok to Sting and his extraordinarily cool approach to standards. How could a rock singer inject so creativeness in approaching Michel Legrand's `What Are You Doing The Rest of Your Life'. Sorry that `My Funny Valentine' was reduced to a gag between Botti and Sting. Also sorry for the classical mistake in the lyrics, when Sting sings `don't change your for me' instead of the correct `don't change a hair for me'. It is too serious to play irresponsibly with `My Funny Valentine', a contextualized song from a Broadway with memorable lyrics by Lorenz Hart.

Jill Scott is a powered-voiced singer who is proper to cover some Aretha Franklin hits but not to sing Billie Holiday with that screaming voice. Beautiful woman, beautiful costumes, beautiful make-up, beautiful voice but no sense using her voice and no respect to the lyrics. You can't sing `Goodmorning Heartache' as you sing `Happy Birthday To You'.

Gladys Knight was discreet and brilliant and her final scat duet with the musicians was practically the only Jazz iceberg end in the show. Also brilliant is Ms. Renee Olstead in her near teenage and funny rendition of `Pennies from Heaven'.

Unfortunately, Mr. Botti is not a Jazz musician and no Jazz may be expected for beyond brilliant Billy Childs'solos here and there.

A long making-of extras in the program helps Blu-Ray fans and specially Botti's fans to hopefully say this is great!",1249084800,2,3506,4.922033898305084

2519314,3,B000EHQ7UG,"I really really really wanted to love this DVD. I've always had a thing for the great jazz trumpet players:  Miles Davis, Jack Sheldon, Bobby Hackett, on down the line.  But there were at least two, maybe more songs on this set that bothered me a bit.  For instance ""What Are You Doing For The Rest Of Your Life?"".  Perhaps Legrand's best song. Although I liked the Sting vocal, I think Botti really needed a mute, (also, the drummer needed brushes).  That's just my take on this song however.

I also didn't care for this version of Young's ""When I Fall In Love"". And how can the great Billy Childs (the pianist here) simply resort to some simple blues chords during his solo?

For my taste, overall, the program was a bit overproduced and not as lyric as an instrument like the trumpet might dictate. Botti has great chops, but I feel that he relies a little too much on certain musical cliches.  My adivse to him is tone it down, emphasize the melody more, and learn when to use the mute. Also, maybe get a new drummer.  But, hey, he's the guy rolling in dough right now, not me.  Maybe I should listen to him?

I do have to applaud his appeal for parents to turn off Star Search and take their children to hear serious musicians, whether jazz or classical.

In all deference, if you are a fan of Botti and his albums, then this is probably going to be a great DVD for you.

If you are like me, a music lover (sometimes jazz) just encountering the music of Chris Botti, then you will have to make up your own mind. This is a serious musician I believe, and one well worth acquainting yourself with.  Although the show didn't work entirely for me, it may do wonders for you.",1229385600,3,1676,4.330128205128205

Perhaps ""Chris Botti & Friends - Night Sessions (Live in Concert)"" is a quite more intimate/relaxed performance given the atmosphere of the site and the reduced size of the venue, which brings the opportunity to choose between two different kind of shows, but none of them seems better than the other one.

They're just different.

As other reviewers have noted sound quality is amazing. The instrumental tracks are incredible and Chris Botti's core band are outstanding especially the two Billy's on piano & drums. CB has a beautiful romantic quality to his playing and thoroughly deserves his place in the line of virtuoso jazz musicians through the ages. Unfortunately the DVD dies off a little in the middle when a trail of vocalists are ushered onstage to sing their obviously under-rehearsed songs although Renee Olstead singing 'Pennies from Heaven' is a gem. If you weren't watching the DVD you would swear you were listening to a seasoned jazz singer. Considering CB could ask any vocalist in the world to his party, why didn't he? I would love to hear him play with the likes of Diana Krall, Jamie Cullum, Natalie Cole or Michael Buble to name just a few. Next album perhaps. It all comes right in the end but no need to encore with a muzak version of an old 'Police' hit. But it looked like a lot of fun was had by all. Definitely worth adding to your live jazz collection.",1222128000,3,1267,5.308457711442786

I was taken aback by this DVD's exceptional sound quality.  Often the picture quality suffered however, due to what I would call ""lighting issues"".  Sometimes though, even the picture quality was exceptional as well.

His trumpet playing was outstanding...the guests were a perfect addition for this event recorded in L.A.
All in all, this is a very entertaining DVD if you like live jazz and instrumental music.

By far, the best song of the show was Mr. Botti's interpretation of Ennio Morricone's ""Cinema Paradiso"" title song.  You can test your entire sound system (for reality and clearity) while playing this DVD.

Botti is a fairly skilled musician, but doesn't really offer too much very ""special"" in the jazz arena. He does have an excellent band that he plays with, and each have good opportunity to spotlight their skills.

As for audio and video quality, it really is current state-of-the-art. The video portion is recorded in its original format of 1080i (originally broadcast on PBS), and is really quite superb. But there is an 96KHz/24bit 5.1 audio track, something quite different entirely than the typical Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.

2519459,5,B000EHQ7UG,"After this magic night in L.A. with an all-star cast of guest vocalists, Chris Botti took the show on the road -- minus the great singers -- and on five consecutive nights stopped in as many Canadian cities, including this one. The all-instrumental show was, to my memory, even better (than this original show) because of the extended solos by Chris himself and his brilliant, accompanying musicians.

Botti told his Winnipeg audience that, when he toured with Sting, he was urged to ""find yourself the best drummer in the world - and make him the heart of your band.""

""So I Googled,"" he said, ""for 'The baddest- *ss drummer in the world,' and up came the name Billy Kilson.""  Then Botti told us: ""What you are about to see, you will not believe.""  He wasn't exaggerating. The drum solo (I forget the tune -- doesn't matter) was beyond any musical experience I've witnessed since Oscar Peterson last performed here 20 years ago.

I turned to the person next to me and said, ""This is like watching a god."" At one point Billy Kilson was performing with just one hand, multiple rhythms, with alternating shadings so subtle it sounded like he was using brushes, not sticks.

The entire band stood out in the front lobby of our ""Burton Cummings Theatre"" and signed autographs until every last patron had gone out into that good night. I wanted to talk to other members of this all star band, comprised of Grammy-winners, including pianist Billy Childs and guitarist Mark Whitfield. Instead, I went straight for Bill Kilson.

""Who are your heroes?""  Billy thought about it a minute, (he has a modest, gentle demeanor) and said, ""My teacher"" (a lesser-known jazz drummer - but an influential artist whose name I can't recall six months later).  When he'd mentioned just that one name, I asked: ""Anyone else?""

""Max Roach,"" he said.

The solo Kilson performs on this DVD is impressive enough; but after seeing him 'in person' on a more extended solo, I would urge jazz fans to find a way to see Billy Kilson ""live and in person,"" -- and be prepared to re-arrange your personal pantheon of greatest-ever drummers! Good to see that the Amazon.com editorial review (above) mentions his name and the word ""remarkable"" in the same sentence!

The ""bonus track"" on this DVD concert, also happened to be Chris Botti's lone 'encore' here in Winnipeg -- a gorgeous rendition of the Arlen/Mercer classic written for Frank Sinatra.  The trumpeter told us: ""I worked with Sinatra for two weeks at the start of my career -- when I was fresh out of college!"" It was, he said, ""the greatest musical experience of my life""

For the Winnipeg audience that gave him a standing ovation, his performance of ""One for My Baby"" -- ALONE -- was worth the price of admission!",1175731200,66,2742,4.721174004192872

The music spans over jazz to rock in a way that Sting is a master of. And yes, Sting appears on the CD and is a musical colleague of Chris. The music is stylish but with soul.

2519493,5,B000EHQ7UG,"This cd is on of the few gifts under $500 that will make you look sophisticated and thoughtful. Chris achieved his status as a result of his smooth, sensuous trumpet playing on tour with Sting (who often appears on Chris's cds).  Chris has the gift of bringing a fresh, cool  feel to  jazz and pop favorites while honoring the mood and melody of the original.  His versions are new and distinctive, but he doesn't change the emotion of the piece by being too improvisational or edgy. Everyone associates Saxaphones with jazz.  Playing jazz on a trumpet requires much more subtlety, and this CD is rare and refreshing example of trumpet-based jaz.",1167004800,,646,4.783783783783784
2519494,5,B000EHQ7UG,"""When I was growing up learning how to play the trumpet, not in a million years did I ever think that tonight will be possible. For an instrumentalist to have his own special, to be onstage with an incredible orchestra, a beautiful hall, and most of all to share the stage with perhaps some of the most distinctive voices in any kind of music - Sting, Gladys Knight, Jill Scott, Paula Cole, Paul Buchanan, Rene Olstead and Burt Bacharach. Everyone's here to join me onstage for this event, which I think is the greatest musical night of my life."" ~ Chris Botti ~

Flashback: December 2, 2005 at the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills, California was to me a fabulous night to remember. And that memorable event is eternalized in this DVD. How great it was to be at that concert - the dreamiest of concerts, and it was so fulfilling to be able to watch Chris Botti perform live in concert with his very special guests - Sting,  Gladys Knight, Paula Cole, Paul Buchanan, Jill Scott, Rene Olstead and of course,  Burt Bacharach. He acknowledged the presence of David Foster and Jeremy Lubbock from among the audience. My only regret is that I wasn't able to meet the  trumpeter-extraordinaire and let him sign my CD booklets as my friend was rushing to leave right after the concert.

Not only Chris Botti does his craft in a creatively exceptional manner but also has a very excellent showmanship. All throughout the concert, he showed a terrific stage presence. All the performances are backed by a full orchestra conducted by  Gil Goldstein, and Mr. Botti's awesome band members - Billy Childs (piano),  James Genus (bass), Mark Whitfield (guitar), and Billy Kilson (drums). In ""Why Not"" Billy Kilson showed off his artistry in drums. Chris Botti believes that the ""foundation of any music really comes from drums."" And he quips, ""I may not be Sting, but I have Billy Kilson in my band.""

Who wouldn't be mesmerized with his hauntingly beautiful solo performances that show off his exquisite trumpet playing? And these beguiling tunes are ""When I Fall In Love,"" ""Someone To Watch Over Me, ""Cinema Paradiso,"" ""One For My Baby"" and  ""A Thousand Kisses Deep.""

One of the show's glorious moments is the special appearance of a living legend,  Burt Bacharach, on one of the most stunning performances, well-applauded, a standing ovation and his own composition, ""The Look of Love,"" which showcase his piano skills and Paula Cole's great vocal style. And Chris Botti has the most wonderful praises about the great composer and I quote: ""Burt has not only written so many incredible songs but musicians love him. He is loved by the public and musicians. When you can capture the elements of both things - to be loved by the public and to be loved by musicians, you probably are in a crew of three to four people.""

Sting adds glitter to the show with his performances on ""What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?"" and ""My Funny Valentine,"" which elicited laughter from the audience whenever his look was directed to Chris as he sings ... ""Your looks are laughable, unphotographable"" and ""Is your figure less than Greek? Is your mouth a little weak?"" After the song, Chris Botti acknowledged and gave credit to Sting saying that if it were not for him, he wouldn't be standing onstage that night. It was Sting who asked him to join his band in Spring of 1999, and he thanked him and his wife, Trudy, as well. Yes, she's the lady from the audience being serenaded by Chris Botti on the intro of ""My Funny Valentine.""

Gladys Knight's dazzling performance on ""Lover Man"" received an enthusiastic response from the audience. There was a prolonged standing ovation. The lady who was seated next to me at the concert said that she was there mainly for  Gladys Knight. Rene Olstead gives ""Pennies From Heaven"" a fresh interpretation that is so stylishly jazzy. Jill Scott delivers ""Good Morning Heartache"" with creativity and elegance. Paul Buchanan's heartfelt and emotional performance on ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" is so moving. And a show-stopper, Paula Cole's ""My One And Only Love.""

I truly enjoy watching this DVD as much as I've enjoyed the live concert a year ago. It's one gem of a DVD. It's a collector's item and one of my most precious collections of recorded live concerts ever. It also features clips from recording sessions, interviews with Chris Botti and his musicians, Sting, and some of his guest artists plus a special performance of ""Message In A Bottle"" by Sting.

Wholeheartedly recommended for your viewing pleasure. It's truly a dream concert.",1166054400,9,4557,4.785987261146497

stirs you up.  I received my copy on the day of my friends birthday party and put it on not knowing that the party would become centered around the tv!  I think everyone there ordered a copy.

2519520,3,B000EHQ7UG,"I bought this DVD upon recommendation from a friend and it was good, but not great. I think you have to be in the mood for this DVD. Most of the tunes are slow and that's OK, if that's what you are wanting at the time. That being said, the musicianship and vocalization are good. I'm a drummer and was told that Billy Kilson was a key reason to buy the DVD, but I was disappointed when I saw him. I'd like to see a DVD with Chris and Billy with some more UPTEMPO material.",1162684800,,472,3.9789473684210526

2519523,5,B000EHQ7UG,This DVD is not only excellent to view but the sound is wonderful. While you'll enjoy the many guest stars (I most enjoyed seeing and hearing Gladys Knight again: where has this woman been? Her voice is still the same after all these years). Chris's band is outstanding. This is the same band Chris has been touring with this year and they are tight and excellent. Add an orchestra and you have magic..,1160524800,2,402,4.52054794520548
2519524,5,B000EHQ7UG,"I just finished watching this for the second time and was totally impressed again--even moreso than the first time through. There is true beauty in this performance from all the artists involved.

I bought this on a lark as I was under the impression that Chris only did smooth jazz Cds and, Lord knows, there's enough of those to last until whenever! Well, it turns out to be one of the best live concerts I've purchased. There's some real cookin' going on as well as some incredibly beautiful ballads.

I had just read about Billy Kilson in ""Modern Drummer' and I was certainly curious about his playing. Being that he's the drummer on this concert, I had to buy it!

Simply put: FABULOUS!! GET IT!!",1158969600,,701,4.592
2519545,5,B000EHQ7UG,"Two words to describe Chris Botti's latest release: ear candy. Or maybe auditory bliss would be a more accurate description?  Either way, you get my point - I love this DVD. There are no gimmicks here - this is a beautiful, slickly produced concert that first and foremost showcases Botti's virtuosic trumpet playing (which is heavenly!). Most of the musical selections are culled from his latest studio album, the duets-heavy disc To Love Again (read my review of that album on Amazon). The duets are truly duets in every sense of the word - Botti's playing partners with each vocalist perfectly, and the two work to compliment each other, resulting in first-class performances. My favorite duets performances are Paul Cole singing ""My One and Only Love,"" Renee Olstead singing ""Pennies from Heaven"" (amazing vocalist!), and Gladys Knight singing ""Lover Man"" (a fantastic performance, very classy). The weakest vocal is Jill Scott's on ""Good Morning Heartache"" - I love the studio version, but her vocal improvisation here is somewhat jarring, to say the least - but the song is still a great vehicle for Botti's playing and I love the lyric. Sting also appears for two songs - ""What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?"" and ""My Funny Valentine"" (it's a nice touch when Botti serenades Sting's wife sitting in the audience during the latter number). The program also features some swoon-worthy solos from Botti, especially ""Someone to Watch Over Me,"" ""When I Fall In Love,"" and ""One For My Baby."" His improvisation on these tracks is absolutely stunning, and the songs provide the perfect showcase for Botti's tremendous talent. The arrangements for all of the tracks sparkle, and it's fun to see and hear Botti and the band cut loose and have some fun with the music. This DVD comes packaged with a bonus CD featuring all the songs from the concert. This is an excellent live recording and a great document of Botti's skill with the trumpet. Now...not to sound (too) impatient or anything, but I am so ready for a new studio album!",1158624000,7,2034,4.861671469740634
2519546,3,B000EHQ7UG,"This is a great cd- the performance, the audio quality, just about everything.

I was very disappointed though that he did not include his most popular song Indian Summer.  This song is what even got me hooked on Botti's music in the first place.

This would be a 5 star for me, except for the very notable omission. If that song doesn't do much for you, then you will really enjoy it.",1158105600,,385,4.319444444444445

My wife and I attended this concert, and lived through the flaws that were edited out. Nothing wrong with the performances, all the issues were accoustic or technical in nature.

What you see here in the edited version is easily the best of the best...  I saw this on HD TV several months ago, and have a copy saved.  I am looking forward to replacing it with a DVD with behind the scenes footage.

THIS IS A GREAT CONCERT, that deserves special recognition.  A must for any Jazz collection!  The incredible warmth of the performances is perfectly documented, and seem to come alive in your living/media room.  Don't miss it!",1153872000,10,747,4.598484848484849
2519550,5,B000EHQ7UG,"I happened to catch most of this special on PBS the other night.  What a lovely concert!  Not at all boring.  The chemistry between Chris and his guests is so apparent during their duets.  You can totally feel that Chris' trumpet is an extension of him; it's his voice and, coupled with a talented singer, is truly a treat for the eyes and ears.  I was a little disappointed with Paula Cole's rendition of The Look of Love; she sounded kind of like she was sick and was a little off-key.  Other than that, she has a beautiful voice.  But the best performance that I saw, the one that brought me to my feet, was JILL SCOTT.  I have no words for how stunning her performance was.  It was not a sad, slow song but it brought tears to my eyes because she was so phenomenal.  She brought down the house!  Sting was so-so and Paul Buchanan was so-so.  I am sorry that I missed Gladys Knight.  Renee Olstead has an incredible voice (esp. for someone so young) but the song she sang did not do her much justice.  All in all, the concert was great- I wish I had been there.  I can not wait for the DVD to come out!",1142812800,34,1105,4.14622641509434
2519551,5,B000EHQ7UG,"As you watch and listen to this concert on PBS - pay attention to the details of each of the performances. The excellence is in the superb complement of musicians and ease with which they all interweave with one another. Listen to the warmth in the vocalists' voices and diversity with which they sing. Yet they are all thread together with Chris Botti's trumpet. The horn never overpowers any guest, never sounds crass, fused or brash but because the subtle beauty of the sound is so engaging - sometimes his beacon of sound is all there is to notice. There are no dramatic gestures, trumpet gymnastics, distracting pyrotechnics or contorted half-dressed dancers here for this televised special, there IS lyrical energy funneled through sound. My favorite guest appearances from the PBS special are ""The Look Of Love""- featuring Paula Cole and Burt Bacharach, ""Pennies From Heaven""- featuring Renee Olstead and ""Lover Man""- featuring Gladys Knight.

We have a few gem musicians to hear live in the world touring at any one time. Many musicians are techinically superb; some are naturally gifted; some work hard at their art; and still others are emotionally connected to their music - very few are all of the above. I have reveled in Chris Botti's live and recorded music for several years, he is all of the above. He is not an overnight sensation, he is consistently brilliant. His live shows with the exceptional musicians he works with are never duplicated from one performance to another and yet his designed aesthetic is destined to be legendary.",1142380800,,1552,4.946360153256705

To say that we both came away from that evening impressed would be a gross understatement!! It was, without a doubt, THE best concert I have seen in years. Chris was noticeably shaky in front of the camera, but, when he played it was pure perfection!! Backed by the London Session Orchestra, his own band which includes Billy Kilson on drums and Billy Childs on piano (both awesome musicians), and a host of celebrities from Sting to Burt Bacarach that appeared on his new CD ""To Love Again"", Chris had the Wilshire Theatre rockin'!! Chris' horn playing and the whole evening was a standout performance and I am so glad that the DVD is finally available (I ordered three tonight) and I hope this DVD does the concert justice. I will watch the PBS special (enduring all the pledge breaks I am sure) this Friday night here in L.A., but I can't wait to fire this up at home and relive every sweet second of that night, it was truly an night to remember and it will never be forgotten.

They drop names like Rick Braun, Kenny G and Norman Brown in the same sentences as Coltrane, Miles, Coleman and  Ellington like there's no difference. Don't get me wrong- I like smooth jazz too- for what it is and what it isn't. That being said, I just watched the Chris Botti special on PBS during pledge and I am impressed with Chris Botti. Yeah, I knew he did the regular smooth jazz stuff. But he can actually play. This DVD chronicles an evening with the London Orchestra. He and his guest show remarkable  range as they explore jazz standards and a couple of pop songs. I especially enjoyed Good Morning Heartache with Jill Scott and Pennies from Heaven with Renee Olstead (who the heck is that... trust me she can ""SANG"" !!!). I listened to ths using my Harmon Kardon's Hall setting and it sounded pretty good but no cigar. I can't wait to watch this with the 5.1 mix on the DVD.

 All in all this is a nice DVD to have that showcases a smooth jazz stallworth bluring the lines to straight ahead jazz. I will certainily add this to my collection.",1141776000,38,1141,4.393364928909953
