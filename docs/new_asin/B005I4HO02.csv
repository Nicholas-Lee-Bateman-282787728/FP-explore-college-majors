4708196,5,B005I4HO02,"I recall watching the series of Jonny Quest as a boy with my parents.  Then one day, this wonderful movie appeared on television.  I was enraptured.  New characters, a more intense plot than anything in the cartoon thus far, and a far more sinister villain than the ones I had grown accustomed to on the show.  I knew then and there that I must have that movie.  So, I waited and saved for the day that it might come to VHS.  But sadly that day never came.  Fast forward to August of 2011.  I was purchasing other videos of former cartoon greats on Amazon, when this wonderful advertisement showed the DVD for Jonny's Golden Quest.  Now, my son and grandson stay up all hours of the night watching this the way I always dreamed of.  Thank you Amazon.com.",1351123200,,754,4.398550724637682
4708197,1,B005I4HO02,"if it wasn't part of the original series. it aint jonny quest. for myself, its about reconnecting with a handful of precious saturday morning memories and these cheap knock-offs just don't cut it. somehow we have lost that feeling and style that was so rich in the classics of the 60s and 70s. its a shame.",1349222400,3,306,4.482142857142857
4708198,4,B005I4HO02,"I started out watching the Jonny Quest t.v. series so even though this movie was not consistent with the stories presented in the series ( Jonny hadn't met Hadji when his mom was living, Race Bannon's relationship with Jade hadn't borne fruit, Jonn was younger, etc.) I still found the movie entertaining.",1325462400,,305,4.884615384615385
4708199,4,B005I4HO02,"Before I start my review, let's get one thing straight here! Jonny's Golden Quest is not and was never meant to be a children's film! Hence the more mature story line and the reason it was only showed on USA TBS or Boomerang. It was made for USA network as one of their ""World Premiere Movies."" These films were focused toward the people in their 20's to 40's or 50's. The hole idea was to appeal to the generations that had grown up with this series and NOT be kid friendly. People do get shot and die and, in one case, vaporized! That said, I would never call this an adult film! we are probably taking PG to PG-13 or maybe R but NOT G! It was also edited down for time. USA did this with most of the shows it showed to allow for more commercials.
 The Jonny quest series was an attempt by hanna-barbera, to make an exciting action  animated series that would be shown weekly and  would appeal to kids that usually watched cartoons. Back in the 60's the standers were not what they were today and you could get away with more violence. Although, Jonny Quest always had a bulls eye over on it by groups that thought that the violence levels, in kids TV were too high! The series was also done on a tight budget. This meant that certain things would be sacrificed in the name of keeping the costs down!
 One of these, most notably, was the story line. for example, Jonny""s mother was omitted as she would have been a 3rdwheel to the action. It would also have cost more to keep such a character cast on the show in terms of animation and voice talent. In the first episode were are told that Jonny ""lost his mother"" but just how we are never told.

Its all well and good for a ""kid orientated show"" to have these issues, but not one that was designed to appeal to adults, even those who watched the original series. Even modern cartoons have problems getting away with a plot line so full of holes. A decision, therefor had to be made. expand on the original series as it was, or try and fix of ""change"" things to make this series work! The  decision  was made to not follow the original plot line for this movie. This may have seemed to make perfect sense to a room full of people that knew nothing of the colt of viewers that had sprang up around the series and may have had something to do with the fourth coming ""Real Adventures of Jonny Quest"", it certainly didn't make any sense to that colt of viewers!

  First, Jonny is now 12, this apparently was done to give his love interest in a  girl named Jessie, who Jonny helps when she is being chased by some thugs, more credibility. She does kiss him on the cheek once during the film, but that is as far as it goes! Its more about them each needing a friend to talk to. Jessie was also never in any of the other series episodes, except for one of the New adventures that was made in the 80's.

 Next, Jonnys mother Rachel. this change dose not seem  too outrageous until we find that Hadji, a character that would show up latter in the original series, after Rachel is dead, is right there with them!
 A friend of Races, a woman named Jade, who is shown in a few of the episodes but not much else is said about her, when she makes an appearance, its not usually as a main character. although she does play a noticeable role in the episodes she's in.  In the movie, she is races ex wife, married to him for one week.

These and other more minor changes are were this movie, much like Jonny during his karate training scene, also in this film, falls on its face! in fact, I would go as far to say that, this movie hits a sold wall of concrete face first and disintegrates on impact! Unlike Jonny who falls on a nice soft mat and is able to get up a walk away! The colt of viewers of this show snubbed this movie big time! No one that was a hard-core fan of the original, wanted anything to do with this movie! In fact! Id  go as far to say, It may have even had a negative effect on the unsuccessful, Real Adventures Of Jonny Quest, which aired a few years after this movie!
 Don't get me wrong! I like this move allot! It's  full of action and emotion, with a great plot twist! The animation, for the time was cutting edge! Remember we are talking about 1993 here. There are a few errors, like Jonny winding up on the wrong side of the mat after his karate session with Race Bannon, this could have somthing to due with the time editing, but over all, the animation is good! The characters move and fidget like real humans do. But all of the changes made to he history of Jonny Quest got the colt following so up in arms that all of these good qualities became completely irrelevant!
 This movie was such a flop that only a few official VHS copy's were ever sold of it! I don't have the exact numbers, but I know they were very rare. OK I admit, I paid far to much for one of these, on an ebay auction, about 8 years ago! But it was the second I ever laid  eyes on! That said, the DVD release of  this film definitely welcome! it looks very good until you give a close look. While The contrast has been vastly improved and the resolution has been updated to slandered-def DVD, there are a few visual compression artifacts in the video itself, not too noticeable but still there. It should also be noted that this film has NOT been restored! What you are getting is the original master with traces of hare on a few of the scenes. Again,  not too noticeable but still there. Despite all of this, the DVD version of Jonny's Golden Quest looks better then the now fading VHS copes out there!
 While this is an official release, its made using a consumer type DVD. This means that some may have compatibility problems. its was also burned using dye and not into the disk itself. This is to say, the DVD has a layer of dye on it were the recoding is stored, which can be scraped off! permanently destroying the DVD. So be careful when handling the disk and what ever you do, don't leave this DVD out of its case!
 I must admit! I've never liked how fan boys tend to be able to control how, or if,  a movie, made about a TV show is successful. But then again, How would I feel If Warner Brothers, who now own Hanna-Harbera, were to release a Batman animated movie, another of my favorite supper heroes, where a young Bruce Wayne lives in a slum, with His father, who becomes a dead beat and his mother, who works as an ""escort""?  In short, if you're a had core Jonny Quest Fan-boy, and not willing to hear an alternative look at the series, don't buy this!  If you have an open mind about Jonny Quest and would like to see an alternative storyline, or just enjoy animated movies, buy this DVD! you won't be disappointed!",1320796800,19,6667,4.239936858721389

4708201,5,B005I4HO02,"Arrived early and safely packaged. Good quality, played well. It was fun to watch the old gang again even if the boys voices were different from the original, though it was great they got Tim Matheson to do the computer's voice since he did Jonny's voice in the original series. You can't go wrong with Dr Zin, giant bugs, invisible asteroid base, etc..., made for a fun plot.",1465171200,,376,4.544117647058823

4708213,4,B005I4HO02,"I've read pros and cons in the 20+ years since its' release but from the first showing on April 3rd 1993 I've felt Mark Young's story line was in the traditional theme Wiley envisioned. I love ""Golden Quest"" and it's so reminiscent of classic Quest episodes.

4708216,5,B005I4HO02,"If you liked the original Jonny Quest, the you'll like this movie. It differs from the original series a bit with the addition of Jonny's mother and Jessie, but it's a cute movie. It does have a bit of violence, so you might want to watch it ad decide if you would like a young child to watch it before letting them see it. It's a classic, though, and an excellent addition to any DVD library.",1390867200,,393,4.184210526315789
4708217,4,B005I4HO02,"I'm a big Jonny Quest fan, mainly of the newer series that ran in the 90s. I read the comics and I was excited for this DVD because this movie was so controversial. It's an old classic and I enjoyed it very much. They only thing that kinda bothered me was the DVD quality. I've noticed this has been an issue from the company as of late. I wish they'd take more consideration in making something of quality. It's basically just a burned DVD with a few printed out labels thrown on it. The DVD doesn't offer any extras either, which I think are fun to watch. Regardless, if you're a fan, of is worth it.",1379289600,2,602,4.198275862068965

8474207,4,B005I4HO02,Great movie! However the DVD is a on demand burn and there are no bonus features. The menu doesn't even have a scene selection feature so if you want to watch a certain scene you will need to fast forward.,1523491200,,205,4.15

8474212,4,B005I4HO02,"It was Jonny Quest. Not as good as the original 26 episodes, but not bad either. It was a bit more modern, had more women in it. I thought the animation was even better. But just something wasn't quite as good. It was still worth watching if you are a Quest fan. I am very happy I bought it. I badly want more like the original 26 but there is no more, so I guess this is the next best thing. (I did't care for Hardrock in the 80's or the computer world of the 1990). / This is a no-frills package with nothing in the case but the DVD. When you put the disc in your player there is no Menu, it just says PLAY MOVIE, ya hit that and it plays, and there is nothing else but the movie, no extras, no nothing. But it's a pretty good movie. Dr. Quest has his original voice.",1501200000,,769,3.9044585987261144

8474215,4,B005I4HO02,"One scene alone sums up this non-PC blast from the past and warrants its immediate purchase while you still can:

While boating up a South American river Johnny and Hadji spot some alligators.  They immediately grab rifles and start shooting the alligators.

Good transfer to DVD.",1481328000,,280,5.043478260869565
