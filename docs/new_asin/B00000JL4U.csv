7912770,5,B00000JL4U,"""The Fire Ships,"" the second volume in the A&E Emmy winning mini-series ""Horatio Hornblower"" starring Ioan Gruffudd, is the best episode for my money.  My appreciation for this episode only increased once I was inspired to go and read C. S. Forester's ""Mr. Midshipman Hornblower"" and read the various chapters which screenwriter Michael Cullen masterfully combines into this 100 minute film.  This particular episode actually covers most of the chapters in the novel covers the start of Hornblower's stellar naval career, and Cullen takes advantage of the strong presence of Robert Lindsay as Sir Edward Pellew, captain of H.M.S. Indefatigable to tie them altogether.  It seems the young Mr. Hornblower is overly impressed with Captain Foster (Denis Lawson), a reckless officer with a grand reputation and an over inflated opinion of his own worth.  Hornblower's blatant hero worship clearly rubs Sir Edward the wrong way and this creates a tension between our hero and his mentor.
This 1998 television movie, directed by Andrew Greive, was known in England as ""The Examination for Lieutenant,"" which is clearly a more apt title.  Of course, the disastrous examination before a trio of captains, headed by Foster, ultimately becomes incidental to the lessons Hornblower has learned on the high seas.  Because of Foster's questionable actions, the Indy is left without provisions, forcing the crew to go to half rations.  While Hornblower is trying to study the necessary books to qualify for his upcoming exam, he is confronted with Bunting (Andrew Tiernan), a mutinous crewman, who proves to be a most personal trial for the young midshipman.  After a Spanish fire ship takes care of one ship of provisions, Hornblower leads a party to buy supplies in Algeria, only to be confronted with an outbreak of the plague.  Gruffudd embodies the role of Hornblower admirably and his best scenes come when he deals with the members of his gun crew (Paul Copley as Matthews, Sean Gilder as Sytles, Chris Barnes as Finch), or when he shares a moment with his Captain.  Clearly Sir Edward sees something in the young midshipman, but that does not stop him from delivery a withering verbal attack when circumstances warrant.  The Horatio Hornblower series is one of those rare instances where the film version equals, if not surpasses, the literary original.  You are strongly urged to enjoy both the books and the movies, as well as to look forward to more of these movies in the future.",1009756800,2,2476,5.056511056511057
7912771,5,B00000JL4U,"i have the entire set of the original volume, and of those it is Fire Ships which is in the vcr the greatest amount of time.
The plot is quite simple,as with most of the stories in the series. The crew is put through great hardships due to the new Spanish tactic of destroying supply ships by lighting their  own ships on fire. Hornblower is also getting ready to be reviewed for a promotion.
The end is extremely climatic and to me, is the most memorable part of the hornblower saga.",1008547200,2,484,4.318681318681318
7912772,4,B00000JL4U,"While not quite as spectacular as the other Hornblower movies (it tends to drag a little in the middle), it is definitely worth seeing, and the ending is great!  The character of Captain Foster is interesting, and that of Mr. Tapling amusing (you might recognize him from A&E's production of Longitude).  All the Hornblower movies need to be seen in order.  The flogging scene is a little intense - but that's how life was then.  Still, a good movie all around!",974505600,4,461,4.654320987654321
