2611203,5,B000GGXEN8,Its very hard to find VHS tapes nowadays and thats all I can play for my twin grandchildren. They love the Bible series and learn a lot from them. I was very pleased with a quick mailing and the condition of the product.,1337558400,,220,4.1395348837209305
2611204,3,B000GGXEN8,"This cartoon was okay, but not what we were looking for.  The topic of the Creation can be a bit difficult to present to small children without the nudity included.  This was good but I was still uncomfortable showing it to the very young (under 8).",1320278400,,249,4.391304347826087

8132061,5,B000GGXEN8,"My favorite Bible stories from when I was a kid! Learned a whole lot, and wanted to buy them to share with my kids! This same review applies to all the other Hanna Barera Bible Stories I have purchased as well!

Buy it!",1480204800,,219,4.093023255813954
8132062,5,B000GGXEN8,Perfect!,1476403200,,8,8.0
8132063,5,B000GGXEN8,Would like to see this in DVD format.  The story of creation and the fall of man is wonderfully told and holds the children's attention throughout.  I used my original copy with my 2nd graders until it wore out.  I was delighted to find another copy!,1463616000,,250,4.391304347826087
8132064,5,B000GGXEN8,"WHY anyone gives this AWESOME series 1 star says they aren't really a fan of christian series.  This is the begining of chrisitan animation.  Sure it sin't great, but the storyline more than make up for it.  Joshua is is my name-sake.  I had a miinistet in my church when I was in elementary school, who called me ""Joshua in the Battle of Jericho.""  I thought it was hilarious & still do.  I had this, but have lost in when my father was  moving in the Air Force.  I have Moses.  I LOVE this series & would give this 7 stars, which is the PERFECT number.",1426982400,,554,4.150943396226415
8132065,1,B000GGXEN8,This was completely destroyed! No way we could watch it!,1414886400,,56,4.7
8132066,1,B000GGXEN8,Unbelievable amount of nudity.  It showed the entirety of Adam and eves buts and very skimpily covered on the front.  I cant possibility let my children watch that. I doubt there is another version of this story with more full nudity ever made with the pretense of being christian. One square inch more of skin and this thing would be R rated.,1405036800,5,343,4.516129032258065
8132067,5,B000GGXEN8,"Don't make them like this anymore....Great movie .  Plan to use in Jr. Church, very soon, Just what we were looking for.",1390608000,,120,4.454545454545454
8132068,5,B000GGXEN8,"I was having a hard time finding this video that I had previously borrowed from the library for my ccd class, so I was thrilled when I saw it was available for purchase. Received it in perfect condition and sooner than they'd promised!",1389571200,,235,4.488372093023256
8132069,5,B000GGXEN8,"Our grandchildren loved this whole series.  I had to keep re-renting it from the video store.  The Creation was one of their favorites.  It does teach the basic story as in a children's Bible story book, only better.  Hanna-Barbera, as usual, was at his best.

I purchased the ones in the series I could find for my 7 year old neice.  She loves them.

I wish the whole series would come out on CD.  I would love my great grandchildren to experience this series like thier parents did.",1345852800,2,484,4.420454545454546
