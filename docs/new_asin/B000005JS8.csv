7903378,5,B000005JS8,"Archive is one of two commercially available videos of one of the greatest Goth bands ever! (The other being ""Shadow of Light"")  Full of stunning concert footage, interdispersed with an art film, Archive has  energy and edge.  This video acurately portrays the less polished (yet  better in my opinion) Bauhaus; more raw, more connected, more exciting than  the Resurrection Tour ever could be.  This video is well worth the money!",953164800,3,431,5.085714285714285
7903379,5,B000005JS8,"With a little art show as filler.  Very different look that what they had on the Resurrection tour, but still incredible to see.  Just a really good video of music and to get a feeling for what they were like when they were  first together.",918604800,4,240,4.288888888888889
