8738225,1,B0177FQYJQ,"HOW, IN GOD'S NAME--Did this poor excuse for a movie GET 5 STARS, AMAZON???? Not even some THEE best Oscar nominated, let alone OSCAR WINNERS GET FIVE FULL STARS! Not one GD A-List name, The most horrific acting. Most of all, The worst story... we fast forwarded after it we figured out the plot exactly 26minutes INTO this piece of garbage. I don't pay $99 a year for Amazon Prime to lie to me. It's way to obvious  that both the Director, and actors had their families & friends rate this. Which btw, I'll do whatever I can to contact Amazon to investigate...ESPECIALLY since they're directly 'linked' ti IMDbPro.",1452211200,,615,4.6422018348623855
8738226,1,B0177FQYJQ,terrible script..with equally poor over-acting and directing,1451606400,,60,7.714285714285714
8738227,5,B0177FQYJQ,"Incredibly well-written and directed film with a number of twists and turns that will have you second-guessing the outcome until the very end! When everyone seems to be the ""bad guy,"" there's redemption at the end of the film and an ending reminiscent of movies like, ""The Sting,"" but with a bit more violence. Paul Sorvino is outstanding, as always and actor Stfano Gallo is the man to watch! ""Cold Deck"" is most certainly a safe bet.",1449014400,4,435,4.662337662337662
