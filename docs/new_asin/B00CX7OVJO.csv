5750752,5,B00CX7OVJO,This is a story of human survival more than about the Holocaust..  It's rated R but I have been with children 10 and over who have been inspired by the survivor's stories.  Absolutely worth the cost.,1376956800,4,199,4.5

5750766,2,B00CX7OVJO,"Did not realize it was a documentary,  Not what we were looking for at the time.  Did not watch most of it,  Maybe at another time",1482883200,,130,3.923076923076923
5750767,5,B00CX7OVJO,This was an exceptional historical documentary that I enjoyed viewing,1482796800,,69,6.0
5750768,5,B00CX7OVJO,This is a movie that handles the atrocities that were done to so many innocent people in a manner that is accomplished in an accurate manner.  The movie shows how man's prejudices against another allows people to turn their backs on their neighbors.  This still occurs today.,1482796800,,275,4.829787234042553
5750769,5,B00CX7OVJO,This movie made me cry and appreciate what I have in life. The story of a great woman a mother that saved her family. Highly reccomend,1482710400,,134,4.1923076923076925
5750770,5,B00CX7OVJO,"This is an amazing story that is so important to tell. I think so it so wonderful they were able to find the people who lived in this cave so they could tell us what it wa really like, so that it will never be forgotten.",1482710400,,220,3.8043478260869565

5750779,5,B00CX7OVJO,"This movie shows how beautiful the human spirit is. It shows how strong human beings can be, and that the will to live will always triumph over evil.",1482451200,,149,4.357142857142857
5750780,5,B00CX7OVJO,"Incredibly moving! One can't imagine the strength it took to survive during that time, much less underground. My first thought was today's families, more so the children/teens of today would be so damaged beyond repair, they are so soft and unprepared for even a weekend underground much less a year and 1/2.",1482451200,,308,4.9423076923076925
5750781,3,B00CX7OVJO,Ok,1482451200,,2,2.0
5750782,2,B00CX7OVJO,I couldn't finish this very dark movie.,1482364800,,39,4.714285714285714

5750785,5,B00CX7OVJO,Quite a story. This movie should make you appreciate how good you have it in America. I doubt most young people today have the discipline to do what this family did. People are amazing!,1482278400,,185,4.470588235294118
5750786,4,B00CX7OVJO,Amazing,1482192000,,7,7.0
5750787,5,B00CX7OVJO,Wow!!  I thought this was an excellent documentary. It definitely shows the determination of people and the human spirit. The treatment of the Jews by the friends and family members and the Nazis is just sickening. You are shown in detail what it was like and it wasn't pretty. A hard core movie about WWII.  It will keep you interested until the end. Very well done. I recommend it.,1482192000,,383,4.536231884057971
5750788,2,B00CX7OVJO,Interesting story but was presented as a documentary rather than a movie.,1482192000,,73,5.166666666666667
5750789,5,B00CX7OVJO,"Wow. I can't believe a story of this magnitude is relatively so little known. It's up there with the other great accounts of the Holocaust. The added aspect of cave survival might place this as the most incredible true account of them all. With plenty of twists, turns, and suspense, it is not only enlightening, but extremely entertaining. The first person accounts add a layer of depth to the already impressive reenactment portrayal. I am not Jewish, but as a 1st generation Mexican-American son of an immigrant, I empathize with the anxiety and uncertainty of living in a time with so much open resentment towards my people. Holocaust accounts of this caliber are more important now than ever as the world sees a rise in anti-foreign sentiment. If you are simply learning about the Holocaust for the first time, looking for a good movie to watch, or even just enjoy survival tales, you should check out this movie.",1482192000,,918,4.8164556962025316
5750790,2,B00CX7OVJO,It could have been better.  It was to generalized.,1482192000,,50,4.555555555555555

5750801,4,B00CX7OVJO,"How they managed to survive, having to resort to hiding in a cave, is what this film is all about. Not only the fear of being caught by the nazis, but also from previous neighbors and so called friends. A little slow going at times, yet the film proves the resilience of the human spirit. Video and sound were okey, and prime members can view it for free. 3.5 Stars.",1482019200,,366,4.242857142857143

5750870,5,B00CX7OVJO,"Wow, this docudrama was amazing.  SPOILERS  What a smart family, hiding in the first cave- then Nazis (or ""the Germans"" as they are referred to by the survivors) come storming in and take some away- but I was impressed that some were able to slip away and hide due to the knowledge they had of the cave.  The second cave was simply stunning and it was impressive how they'd created a survivor society down there- mostly sleeping and beating others for stealing food.  When the families' names are written in the cave and the movie flashed it forward to Chris Nicola staring up at the names in his cave gear, that was stunning.
The best part about this is, of course, that there are LIVING survivors that are interviewed and not just one, but several and four even return to the caves that ""fought for them.""  It was sad to see that their original town had essentially became nothing but a ghost town (where are the people? Either dead or immigrated as this family had done but mostly dead).
It was wonderful to see a couple grandchildren joining in the cave expedition.  All in all, an inspiring story and well worth anyone and everyone's time. How unbelievably amazing the human spirit can be.",1480982400,4,1194,4.582159624413146
5750871,5,B00CX7OVJO,"Excellent movie. Have watched many movies on the subject matter, however the way this story came about and was told, is very capturing.

The tale is told as a visual narrative and does a great job of describing the brutal living conditions experienced by these families over hundreds of days while fearing discovery, starvation, and betrayal by neighbors, and the horrific actions of people they once knew as friends or acquaintances. Without these kinds of stories being told, we might forget the moral depths to which humans can descend and the cheapening of human life in times of war.",1479168000,,575,4.76

I was disappointed, though not surprised by the lack of reaction or welcome by their former neighbors.  The German propaganda machine, later adopted by the USSR had their only party fallacies. They had been divided an polarized by that propaganda so outrageous that the uneducated believed it to be true. Heck, the Poles were rounding up Jews before Nazi propaganda even reached their borders. Such a enthusiastically helpful bunch.

Not only did he find several of the survivors, now in their late 80's and 90's, who told him their story. He also tracked their descendents, now flourishing in Canada and the US.

5751072,4,B00CX7OVJO,"Esther Stermer, matriarch of the Stermer family saved her family from almost certain death during the Holocaust by taking them into the underground caves in the Ukraine. This compelling docu-drama narrates how this came about.

In 1942, the situation for Jews in Ukraine was dire as the Nazis and local collaborators rounded up Jews for deportation to the labor and extermination camps. Many Jews were also rounded up by the Ukrainian police and shot. Esther decided that the family would hide in some caves, but these caves were known to the locals, and the Nazis and Ukrainian police found them and arrested them. However, with a combination of good luck and determination, the family survives and manages to escape once again, and this time they make their way to a cave that is not known to others. Not only do they find refuge here, they are also lucky to have running water which makes it convenient for them as they don't have to leave the caves as often, unless to find food. In all, 38 people from two Jewish families, the Stermers and Wexlers, survived the war in the caves.

The surviving members of the family recount what it was like at the time, with tales of near-misses and periods of living in uncertainty, but the story is one of survival and eventual triumph over adversity. During a time when millions of Jews were slaughtered, this tale of courage, resilience, and survival is one that gladdens the heart. I especially enjoyed the scene where some of the surviving members, the oldest aged 91, visit the Ukraine to revisit scenes of their past, including the caves, accompanied by their grandchildren. Truly a memorable docu-drama.",1391472000,13,1652,4.833922261484099
5751073,5,B00CX7OVJO,"In addition to the remarkable courage and determination of the victims, tribute must be paid to the Ukrainian American, Chris Nicola, who quite by chance unearthed this tale of almost unbelievable endurance and beavered away to bring it to the screen. This is such an extraordinary story it almost defies belief. Although those living in the cave had very limited but critical support from outside in obtaining food and other supplies, their creativity and the courage of the children in particular is absolutely inspiring. Those still alive to participate in this film exhibit maturity and vision beyond the ability of most men and women and are a credit to their families and to mankind in general. I would have liked to have seen a detailed making of doco but the short clips that are offered are still interesting.
This is one of the most remarkable stories of its type to come out of the Shoah and will hold your interest from beginning to end. I would give it 6 stars if that was an option although the video is necessarily grainy and a bit murky.

5751084,5,B00CX7OVJO,"A REAL survival story!

This is an exellent docu/drama.  It tells the true story of Jewish families that with thier strong will, self reliance and innovation were able to survive long term living underground in two caves to evade persecution by the Nazi occupiers in the Ukraine.

This isn't some hollywood sensationalized story of a thrill seeker that just made an accident.

These people were fighting for thier lives from the start.  They did not go underground for any other reason than thier basic need to survive.

This movie was good from start to finish.  I like the duel formats.  The movie starts out as just a documentary, but then evolves into some dramatizations, with narration from the real survivors of this ""adventure"" for lack of a better word.

The movie has a great ending, and some enlightment about how our neighbors can act in the real world.  I also liked how those indomitable people were able to pass on some perspective to thier grandkids.

On another note, it is good to see another side of the Jewish people of that time, which is a group of strong, smart, and self reliant people that beat the Germans.  Instead of just the countless hapless victims that had no hope or way of protecting themselves from an overwhelming wave of only what I can describe as ""evil""",1384905600,13,1292,4.693333333333333

5751087,5,B00CX7OVJO,"This week, author and force behind the movie and a fellow caver, Chris Nicola, came to my house on the way back from a caving trip in the southern US and presented the movie, followed by a presentation and discussion about the research which resulted in the movie, the discovery of survivors, the making of the film and what has transpired since the film.  Our audience was a diverse group of cavers, ages, backgrounds and education.  All present felt the power and the emotional connection with the story of intense deprivation followed by triumph.  Not being Jewish, it is difficult to comprehend the significance of 6 million people being exterminated by the Nazis.  It is much easier to grasp the story of 1 persons story of the holocaust multiplied 6 million times.

This film tells the story of holocaust survival of 38 individuals ranging in age from infant to aged.  The movie and the discussion showed how these individuals were able to adapt survive under very harsh conditions and in near total darkness in a cold damp environment under near starvation conditions.  We had a big advantage having Chris here to lead the discussion afterwards.  Questions were raised about almost every aspect of the film and we gained additional insight beyond the limited time provided in a film.  Chris genuinely cares a great deal about these survivors & their descendants and is emotionally committed to preserving the memory of those who have passed and those who did not survive.

Technical difficulties with the movie concern the difficulty of filming an event which took place almost entirely in the dark, and filming cold and dampness,  This environment was much harsher than can be depicted on film and our understanding this point was facilitated by the discussion between  cavers and non cavers after the film.  I found that the music was a bit louder than the voices, so I boosted my center channel 1 db before showing the film and nicely solved the problem.

All the people in this story were just normal people just like us, but, through no fault of their own, they were placed into an unthinkable environment.  The film is the story of people triumphing in the face of unbelievable adversity, giving hope for the ultimate triumph of humanity.  I highly recommend purchasing this film, seeing it with others, and discussing the meaning.  You will be a better person as a result.",1381795200,2,2386,4.866336633663367

5751090,3,B00CX7OVJO,"Director Janet Tobias' No Place On Earth (2012) is a low-budget, docudrama which examines the survival of several Jewish families (mainly the Stermers and Wexlers), led by matriarch Esther Stermer, who found sanctuary from the Nazis in two caves in Western Ukraine during the Holocaust. Cave explorer, Chris Nicola, stumbled upon evidence of the Jews' underground haven in the early 90s and searched for more details. His exploits eventually caught the attention of National Geographic which published an article about the survivors in 2004.

No Place On Earth is a somewhat interesting film although the low-budget constraints don't do justice to the incredible story. Also, survivor Saul Stermer's plentiful testimony is maddeningly indecipherable. Subtitles should have been provided. Interested viewers may also want to check out Agnieszka Holland's ""In Darkness"" (2011), a 5.5 million dollar release which depicts a true-life story of Jews surviving the Holocaust while hiding in the sewers of Lwow, Poland. In Darkness was nominated for the 2012 Best Foreign Film Oscar.",1380844800,15,1076,5.5212121212121215
5751091,5,B00CX7OVJO,"I have been waiting to see this movie since it came out. It has not shown in my state yet, so I was happy to be able to rent it from Amazon to watch. It was as touching as I thought it would be. These family's, that were devastated by separation, starvation, death, and being hunted like wild animals, and the courage they had to survive was inspiring. According to scripture these things very well may happen again at some point in time, and to know the courage and daily trust these people had together to survive and care for each other was uplifting. The man who discovered the cave, and that there must be a history behind the trinkets he found, is fortunate to have been given the details to bring together such a touching story. Its hard to imagine being hunted down and killed just because you were born to a certain race of people. But then as history repeats itself, will we be looking for a cave? Hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did. There are so many historical movies about the Jews who escaped their pursuers. These dear folks were able to revisit that cave, and relive that bitter sweet time of family struggle to survive. They all touch my heart and this one was no exception. It's worth the watch!",1380672000,,1220,4.355263157894737

5751094,5,B00CX7OVJO,"I think sometimes we forget how easy we have it, then we see stories like this.

Talk about perseverance - It wasn't just one cave it was two.  Shot at.  Buried alive.  On and on.

I'm so glad they were able to record some of these stories before the families completely passed away.  Also glad to get to see them go back and bring grandchildren with them.

It was terrible to see how their lifelong neighbors treated them when they were finally liberated.  I'm not a religious person but God bless them for what they went through, the strength they showed, and the lives they went on to lead.

Watched it twice during my rental period because it was worth it.",1380067200,,660,4.3884297520661155

5751098,4,B00CX7OVJO,"Regardless of the decades that have passed since the horrific atrocities of the Nazi Holocaust in Europe, stories of inspirational survival continue to sprout up. I suppose this is a silver lining in the tragedy that befell so many families; that there were some who were able to persevere and survive. Entire family trees exist because of the bold decisions a few made in order to avoid entering the ghettos, not to mention the concentration camps.

  In October of 1942, Esther Stermer and her various immediate and distant family members were forced to enter caves outside of their city in order to avoid the Nazis. They were joined by many other families and eventually caught, but were able to escape before being sent away for good. They then found another cave which had never been discovered, and it had its own water supply to help decrease any need to leave shelter. The women and children lived in the cave for nearly a year and a half, which is the longest recorded uninterrupted underground survival period. The men would leave their hiding place only to seek out food, much of which needed to be stolen discretely.

  The story is discovered by amateur cave explorer Chris Nicola comes across some of their belongings in the first cave and decides to investigate. Much of the film is told through interviews, however, and then the last section of the movie is dedicated to the survivors who are able to return and see the caves this many years later. One gentleman in his 90s brings his grand-daughter to see the caves that he survived in, making for a moving revelation about the generations of family members who are alive because of the bravely of those few.
