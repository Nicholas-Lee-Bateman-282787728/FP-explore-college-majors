607078,4,6303236677,"Well, I liked the film more than TOP GUN, but the one thing that bugged me about the original and this movie was the use of aircraft.  In the original movie, the MIG-23s were Israeli IAI Kfir-C3s armed with two 30mm cannons and some very unrealistic looking rockets.  Also, the helicopters in the film were not Soviet-bought 'Hinds' as they were stated to be.  They were actually surplus US Army AH-1S Cobras.  As far as the second film, the MIG-29s were actually surplus USAF F-4F fighters.  You'd probably only notice these minor details if you were or are a major aircraft buff like myself, but if not you'll enjoy the movie a lot more.  Overall, the movie portrays the US Air Force in a good light and is very well put together.",977961600,,732,4.507575757575758
607079,4,6303236677,"I've seeon only the first two, so I'm not yet fluent with all of the plot, but the 2nd movie is a little distracting.  The Soviet ""BMP-5's"" are nothing of the sort.  Actually, they're ex-Israeli M113 APC's equipped  with twin 40mm guns and rather pathetic rockets on the sides.  The MIG 29's  (if thats what they were supposed to be) didn't look realistic enough.  About the only thing that I was impresed with was the BTR-162 6x6 carrier  that was featured.",954892800,,458,4.580246913580247
607080,4,6303236677,This movie taught that are enemies are not always communists.  It was brilliant idea for its time.  Yes alot is borrowed for Star Wars.  But I feel that this movie made efforts besides the Migs are really F-4s and  middle country had Kfirs or F-21s Aggressor aircraft being enemy aircraft.  It isn't strongness story I had watch but this sounds like real possibly in  the future cooperation with Soviet Arms Forces. It is unfornated that Doug  gets waxed but that another film.

The only thing it really lacks is authenticity on the  enemy fighter planes; so, if you're a fighter plane buff, you'll recognize  the enemy planes as good 'ol vietnam era U.S. surplus.
Otherwise, if you  liked Top Gun, you'll want to see this movie at least once.",946425600,5,506,4.651685393258427
607083,5,6303236677,"Well, this film was kinda lacking, in that Jason Gedrick's character, Doug Masters, gets blown out of the sky in the first 3 minutes and that he was assigned a crappy callsign. However, the soundtrack was ok, but not as  brilliant as the original.. There are more plot holes than the original..  Ever notice how the Russian soldier, (""Lebanov"", I think his name  was) is the same guy who played a Mid-Eastern bad guy and tortured (read:  beat-up) Doug's dad, Colonel Ted Masters in the first movie...
Ha! Only  true Iron Eagle devotees would notice that one.. you've got to get all four  of these movies and sit around with some friends from your school days  (let's face it, that's when we had IRON EAGLE in our blood) and get some  pizzas and beer and enjoy them all over again!

607705,1,6303236677,"This movie doesn't howl at the moon, it doesn't bark, it just yips. Leave this lawn dart where it belongs.

What a shame. I hoped for something at least close to the first movie in terms of  fantasy, feel good entertainment. But even Lou Gossett's acting seems to say ""Call my agent, get me out of here!"" Mind: I love his acting.

And his acting is the only thing holding it together. First, there's the highly out of character death of Doug Masters. That was bad enough. Then the ""Soviet"" aircraft...okay, I know this is fantasy, but even a Tibetan hermit knows the absolutely distinctive shape of an F-4 Phantom II, and there was never a Soviet plane with an even vaguely similar appearance or performance. Sure, Top Gun used F-5's, but at least F-5's are or were used in both air services' combat weapons schools to simulate Soviet fighters.

Can you say, ""crash and burn""?

I knew you could.

Disciplined for his part in the affair by being assigned to duty at an Air Force museum, Chappie finds himself elevated to one-star general and asked to improve upon the maverick mission that put him there.  Once again a rogue Middle Eastern state (probably Iran) is causing trouble: it has created a bunker deep in its desert and installed a missile capable of reaching targets as far away as Russia.  Both the US (for the sake of its allies in the region) and the Soviets want the bunker and missile destroyed, but neither wants to start a full-scale war, so a surgical strike with co-ordinated ground and air units has been planned.  And since neither country quite trusts the other, those units must be made up of personnel from both.  It's Sinclair's job to weld them into a cohesive force that can work together and bring down the bunker.  The problem is that the people assigned to him are misfits and mavericks--and his nominal superior, Gen. Stillmore (Stuart Margolin), is setting him up to fail.

With personality conflicts galore, a tentative romance between USAF Capt. Matt Cooper (Mark Humphrey) and Russian pilot Valeri Zuyeniko (Sharon H. Brandon), and a tension-filled climactic sequence in which Chappie and his team try to carry out their mission before an en route bomber can hit the target and throw fallout for hundreds of miles, this movie, like its predecessor, is especially notable for the aerobatics that fill a good part of the running time.  Other reviewers have found fault with the authenticity of the fighters used, but I don't know enough about modern ordinance to care; I just enjoy the flying.",1275004800,,1980,5.243670886075949

Second, The movie used F-4 Phantoms as a substitute for a MIG 29 for the Russians. The F-4 Phantoms is very far from reality compared to Mig 29. They should have used F-15 because it really looked similar to the Mig 29 with double tail fins and 2 engines with large boxed type intakes. The least choice should be an F-18 instead of the F-4 Phantoms. Third, the ground support units used an improvised M113 instead of the russian BMP's as what is mentioned in the movie.

607778,3,6303236677,"This sequel to ""Iron Eagle"" is as dated as the first movie - but less fun.  In the first movie (Reagan era bombast at its most guiltily pleasurable) Chappy Sinclair and Doug Masters (Louis Gossett, Jr. & Jason Gedrick) single-handedly take on an un-named mid-eastern regime in a rogue mission.  Sinclair goes back to that never-named mid-eastern regime (a slick composite of Iraq & Libya), but this time he's not only following orders - he has to bring a bunch of Soviet fighter-drivers with him.  That's right - where the first movie was a big video game, the sequel is obviously one of those movies on the cusp of the end of the cold-war, with American and Russian pilots struggling to get past their differences for the common good.  As part of his mission to neutralize a WMD installation, Sinclair gathers together a wing of F-16 fighters and Russian MiGs - uniting the two in a secret Israeli base (which more plausibly explains the obviously Israeli markings).  Sinclair races the clock - not only to beat the evil regime's plan to launch their nukes, but also to prevent the nuclear mission the Russian and American bureaucrats planned to launch in the event Sinclair's plan failed.

IE2 is sort of a mixed bag - it's got more elaborate flight sequences than the first movie, but only slightly.  Also, the story loses something in trying to be more mature than the first movie (professional pilots rather than a bunch of ambitious teens; this time, the heroes are trying to save the unnamed country from getting hit harder).  Still - it's better than IE-3, and for mil-aviation fans, IE-2 has some of the best footage of F-4 Phantoms in action that you're likely to see.  (Fans of the mighty Phantom should be in for a double thrill, not only catching their favorite ride in action, but also as a stand-in for the Russian Migs - the idea of casting the grizzled fighter as a cutting-edge jet seems to be an uninventive case of mis-casting, but the F-4 handles the role just fine).  In short, it's still not up to the standards of ""Top Gun"", but IE-2 is still fun.",1091404800,2,2071,4.633879781420765

If Chappy were a real person I would marry him and have a life of action and romance in his jet, going really fast all over the world and blowing stuff up. I am not sure if Chappy should be hanging out with little boy though, that could be bad. You know what they say ""16 will get you 20"". You just have to watch this film, you too will be swept away by the passion that Chappy exudes.

The thing I like about this movie is that these people have attitude, real attitude for about everything they do from the mad fighting to romance and most of all they put in a girl as a Pilot which I think spices up things even more, because not only is she the only female but she is also on the oppisite side. But other than that the plane shots were total hot-shot flying which is excellent, the Russian accent was fabulous, the plot was very good and so was the story.
