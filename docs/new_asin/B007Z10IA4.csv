I liked the architecture too.",1403136000,,123,5.2
5114902,1,B007Z10IA4,"**WARNING SPOILERS***
This show Super SUCKED. The continuation of the first season is a shoddy replacement?? It comes complete with unattractive actors and characters you could care even less about. The only one left is her creepy dad and he's not enough to carry the show over. Kate actually but barely makes it into this first episode before they kill her off somehow --I honestly lost interest when I realized from the first episode that they were not going to give the first season any resolution. I should have stopped at episode three but I kept on punishing myself. You never find out what happened to any of the characters in the previous season and that is what got me the most. I tuned in hoping to get closure from the cliffhanger in season one and was shocked to find they seemed to change the direction entirely and not for the better either. There are quite a few things I did not get. First, Kate returns to Bedlam and the apartment and calls out for Jed (or so I thought) at the beginning of the episode however they later allude to him being dead? What's up with that? So did the actors or writers move onto better things and they couldn't get them back or did they just decide to re-tune the whole show? I've seen many BBC shows before and I'm not a stranger to the concept of changing the cast after a season however the whole show just seemed off by not offering any type of resolution to the previous season's cliffhangers. At least Dr Who gives you that. It didn't have to be neat and tidy but it did need to make sense for your viewers to keep watching. Instead they give you some chick with a humongous head and bug eyes and a pair of dorks living in their flat. Kate just disappears after not being able to talk her ""maybe-serial-killer"" dad out of selling Bedlam and that's where the next group of misfits come in. I also find it hard to believe that some weirdo girl turns up at the flat in Bedlam looking for Jed and instead of these two guys thinking shes some kind of psycho they let her stay there?...Really? Its a terrible show, and a terrible investment in your time or money. I can't say enough how idiotic and stupid season two turned out to be. You just start to wonder what happened and why anyone with eyes would keep watching. Instead I'd recommend pulling out the old X- Files DVDs-- you can at least nap or fall asleep to those.",1393718400,4,2369,4.386363636363637
5114903,5,B007Z10IA4,I was disappointed it was on the internet & had to wait till it came out to buy to see it. I think the show is in all good taste & I love the paranormal shows with substance.,1366243200,,174,3.6052631578947367
5114904,3,B007Z10IA4,"Not sure about the new approach to shows by the Brits. Tried and true is always best where they are concerned. For those thinking it may be something like Being Human, it misses the mark by a mile. The first series is awful and would never have bothered to keep watching had I not already purchased both series. Happily, the second series is better, with tighter and more cohesive stories. They got rid of the leads from the first and it generally works better all round, but is overall a huge disappointment.",1365724800,,509,4.543478260869565
5114905,4,B007Z10IA4,"Season one was a little bit of a soap opera, trying to keep track of who was sleeping with whom. This season is much better, more like a proper ghost story. This was definitely an enjoyable use of a few hours.",1359936000,,209,4.121951219512195
5114906,4,B007Z10IA4,"The almost complete cast change was a bit disconcerting, and it seems like the direction is a bit darker.  It is still a pretty good show though.  I'm pretty much an Anglophile and enjoy a lot of British programming.  It appears that more of the cast will stay for a second season which is good.  Also, although there is a bit of bed hopping in the season, it isn't like last season where you wondered if the characters had rabbit genes.  :-P",1356048000,,442,4.341463414634147

5114908,5,B007Z10IA4,this was a great find on amazon to be able to watch a bbc program that i wasn't able to catch up on series in regular TV,1355011200,,120,3.4814814814814814
5114909,1,B007Z10IA4,The shows are getting nonsense day by day after season one. Don't waist your money and time to watch it!!!,1352764800,,106,4.35

8523207,2,B007Z10IA4,What the hell where is Jed???  Not so happy that was the only reason I liked it!!!  Wasted my money buying this whole season 1 just to see completely different people in Season 2!!!,1458000000,,181,4.294117647058823
8523208,2,B007Z10IA4,"What happened?  Pretty good first season, the second season is a complete nosedive into Annoyingville. In the second season, there are all new flat mates and none of them are interesting or particularly like-able. The protagonists from the first series do not return to the second series, basically the show is starting again from scratch.
This season the revenants and plot lines are pedestrian, nothing very spooky. Young girl is haunted by various spirits with issues,  The usual dysfunctional dead people with noncorporeal baggage
 The first season featured fantastic production values. You really believed that the characters were living in a gentrified upscale apartment residence. Unfortunately, the expensive remodel was constantly undermined by the haunted asylum it was built on.
 In season two, the production values were pretty unremarkable, which was pretty much inline with the rest of the show. Watch the first season but I'd skip season two. It is not very good.",1451433600,3,978,5.3311688311688314
8523209,3,B007Z10IA4,I love the first season of Bedlam and was excited to know that there was a second season even though the cast was different. I don't think the characters in the second season where as strong and they kind of struggled to to fit everyone together with the main story. We also don't really get a well developed conclusion to the items left open in the last episode of season one which was a bit disappointing.,1445212800,,407,4.368421052631579

8523211,1,B007Z10IA4,I am so disappointed. I watched season 1 with The James and loved it. I then ordered season 2. I opened the first episode and to my surprise all the characters are different. I will not watch this.,1426464000,,197,4.2105263157894735
8523212,5,B007Z10IA4,Very good thriller series,1426118400,,25,5.5
8523213,3,B007Z10IA4,"Season 2 is not as good as Season 1. It has the same concept but different characters and approach. The charisma from the first season is just not there. The ending, however, is incredibly creepy. It could have been done a lot better. But the cliffhanger ending made the season worth watching.",1422576000,,293,4.653846153846154
