The DVD is NOT a flashy Hollywood/Discovery/National Geo production. Nevertheless it contains Gold Medal Stuff. Please note  I have NO business interest in the Todd Group .  What the DVD shows is some practical moves done in slow motion, repeated many times over so that the SERIOUS student of self defense can learn and train. Of course the cover picture is of guys is military camo and the video is one woman and two gents in track pants and t shirts. If they were to wear military camo would that make any real difference to the techniques? Be sensible.",1474675200,,675,4.570247933884297

8324397,1,B000CGXILK,"Hi,
I received my copy a couple of hours ago, what a disapointment. What you see is not what you get. I was expecting to see some insight into military based hand to hand combat training (see front cover and the back cover is even more impressive).What you get is two guys and a gal in sweatpants and tee shirts in a gym in kiwi-ville repeating about five basic defensive moves that are deemed to solve all your close combat needs, what a joke.",1149120000,9,444,4.2976190476190474
