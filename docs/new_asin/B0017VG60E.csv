8267502,4,B0017VG60E,"After watching this, I wasn't really certain what I'd seen. The camerawork is great, the scenery harsh but beautiful and the acting good but the story...  Was there one? At all?

A town somewhere in a futuristic West periodically sends a young man into the Badlands surrounding it to act as a guard against others entering their territory. His only companion is a horse who must stay with him as long as he's alive. The current ""guardian"" has been there 12 years and wants nothing omre than to figure out a way to make the horse think he's dead so he can go home. (Nothing is made of the fact of what will happen if he does go home, because then it'll be obvious he's still alive.) He meets 3 strangers...the son of a man building a monorail for a place called New Gibralter, that man's killer, and the man who hired the killer...and that's more or less it.  The story of each man's background is told in flashback while they have their stand-off. There's a bit of an ironic twist at the end.

At first glance and all thereafter, this film could pass for a spaghetti western in its heyday, making just about as much sense but with less violence. I was also reminded of Stephen King's The Gunslinger because of the dystopian elements.  The soundtrack is definitely a la The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly with vocal and whistling and one expects at any moment to hear that familiar bird-call heralding the beginning of that famous piece. The  Canadian scenery is harsh, beautiful, and alien-appearing.  The actors all have that very still, deep-voiced delivery which made me wonder at first if the dialogue was dubbed but everything appeared in sync and they were speaking English. Oh and the horse is a very beautiful, if interesting-looking, one who also gets billing credit.

It had a lot going for it and could've been something great if there had only been more of a story. Unfortunately there wasn't. I'm still wavering on whether I liked it or not. Since I give it four stars, I guess I did, but...",1398384000,,2001,4.554317548746518
8267503,5,B0017VG60E,"I have been waiting to see the Six Reasons Why film for quite some time.  I must say it was a great result, I loved the way the film was shot, truly resourceful.

We'll be seeing more of the Campagna Duo I'm sure of it.

Highly reccommended purchase.",1223510400,,250,4.166666666666667
8267504,1,B0017VG60E,"Six Reasons Why is a waste of time.
I could not get into the story, and the actors are amateurs (except for Colm Feore).
The movie is being touted as an example of indie filmmaking in the tradition of the Coen brothers.
The Coen brothers put out quality product from the start.
Save your time and money for something worthwhile.",1221696000,,328,4.483333333333333
8267505,1,B0017VG60E,"This was the slowest most drawn out movie I've ever seen. The story is about a wandering desperado who, while riding a horse and carrying a six gun, is really living in the future. He's been given a quest by a preacher which is the hint that he's suppose to be a good guy out to get the bad guys in the bad lands. There wasn't any twist to that in mind. The film never grips you and the best thing that I can say is that since I rented this, I could turn it off without having to leave my seat. The acting is poor and the filming gives this movie more of an amateur feel than a indie film.  If you want to do yourself a favor, skip this movie and rent a sleeper like In Bruges.",1216771200,,677,3.870503597122302
8267506,4,B0017VG60E,"At first from the weapons you think this is a typical 1880's
Arizona/ New Mexico western. Slowly it dawns on you when the guy
uses a battery from two passers-bye to power an IPod and the TV
in a bar tells about the death of the monorail owner, that this isn't just another Italian western, but a movie set in the far future
where civilization is a small community surrounded by
the bad lands. The fellow who we take as a crazy wondering murderer
is actually the lawman whose duty is to terminate those outlaws in the bad lands who are social outcasts.
Strange justice and a twist gives a very unexpected end.",1211846400,7,608,4.389380530973451
