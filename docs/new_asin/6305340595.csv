The film is based on a semi-autobiographical novel of the same name written by Violette LeDuc in 1954.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thrse-et-Isabelle/dp/2070758958/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thrse et Isabelle</a>&nbsp;[English translation available:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THERESE-AND-ISABELLE/dp/B0000BSADF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THERESE AND ISABELLE.</a>]

The film is not really about lesbian sex.  It is a film about a sensitive young woman who, through circumstance, becomes progressively isolated from the love of her family.

Thrse is the only daughter of a French couple.  Her father dies.  In the wake of her grief over the loss of her father, Therese's mother decides to re-marry.  Not only must this sensitive adolescent deal with the grief of her father, she is now a rival, with her new step-father, for the affections of her mother.

Thrse's mother's desire to move on with her new life, and new marriage, results in Thrse being cloistered in a finishing school for girls in Northern France.  Lonely, isolated, struggling with her new flood of emotions coming of age, struggling with the grief over the loss of her father, and, separated from the affections of her loving mother, Thrse meets Isabelle at the school.

Isabelle, a pretty and more experienced young woman, provides Thrse with the comfort and friendship which she needs to mature and resolve her many feelings.

What follows is one of the finest portrayals of a young person's feelings, and, the simple beauty of interpersonal intimacy that one could imagine.

This film flowers with talent.  The score was written by Georges Auric, one of France's finest film composers, most famous for his score to ""Beauty and the Beast.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Georges-Auric-Beauty-and-the-Beast/dp/B0007ACVLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Georges Auric: Beauty and the Beast</a>.  Unfortunately, the haunting soundtrack for Thrse and Isabelle is not available.  The wistful themes in Auric's score enchant the viewer into Therese's world.

The film was photographed by Hans Jura (who photographed many of Radley Metzger's films).  The film contains some of the most beautifully composed photography of the feminine form that I have ever seen in film.  Jura's talents are equal to those of lesbian-interest photographer Judy Francesconi, whose work is otherwise incomparable.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visual-Sonnets/dp/0962995924/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visual Sonnets</a>.

This is a story about how a sensitive young woman resolves the overwhelming emotional challenges of grief, adolescence and loneliness through her erotic love for her friend.",1344988800,4,2891,6.462337662337663
7888131,5,6305340595,"Therese is a girl who has been betrayed by her mother who said they would not part, but ended up getting married and sending Therese to an all-girl's school, There Therese meets and falls in love with Isabelle, another student, and together they fall in love and have a lesbian sexual relationship. Although they vow never to part, Isabelle is pulled out of school and the relationship is ended.

The film is black-and-white. There is a lot of emotional power in the movie in the relationship between the two girls. This is not a pornographic film at all, but it does have its erotic moments. The two girls are seen totally nude from the back and nude from the waist up from the front. There are no up-close explicit shots; the film relies on emotions more than on graphic activities.

Therese has been through a lot and the viewer may feel end up feeling sorry for her. I, for one, would like to know how she adapted to life at the school after Isabelle left.

During the love-making scenes there is usually a voice-over with phrases from the book and those do tend to be rather over-flowerly. The musical background is acceptable. Again, though, the focus of the movie is on the two girls falling in love with each other more than anything else.

I think that it's a wonderful movie, something that deeply affected me when I first saw it, and it still affects me today.",1317254400,,1371,4.538461538461538
7888132,5,6305340595,I saw this movie a few years ago for the first time.  It's now part of my film library.  Such a provocative film for 1968.  This film was way before it's time.  I strongly recommend this film if you enjoy Lesbian films with a plot.  The film is extremely erotic with the dialog alone.  You'll get your fill of nudity too.  Very well done.,1016236800,14,338,4.1875
7888133,5,6305340595,This movie is one of the most sensitive handlings of first love.  The acting is so well done you suffer along with the characters as they awaken to their mutual feelings.  The narration is beautiful and the scenes tasteful but erotic.,1008028800,6,234,4.682926829268292
7888134,4,6305340595,"Radley Metzger at his best! This is a haunting and deeply moving tale about love, sexuality and adolescence. Camerawork and editing are superb. And Essy Persson as Therese is just marvellous. The real downside is the presentation of this movie. The DVD is widescreen (slighly cropped, i think) but the picture is too soft. This is a shame because this beautiful movie deserves a first class presentation!",1003017600,6,404,5.044776119402985
7888135,5,6305340595,"This movie is one of the most sensual and touching movies about first love between two girls. When I first picked up the video, I did not expect more than light entertainment. After all, what can you expect from a 1960's  movie depicting such a taboo subject!  But I was pleasantly surprised. The  setting is classic: an all girl school! You are a witness to an all  encompassing first romance and erotic relationship of two young girls.  Without hesitation, they both follow their hearts exploring each other. I  expected them to be caught at any moment during their carefree  adventures... The black & white cinematography gives this movie great  character. Switching from young girl to reminiscing woman makes 'Therese  and Isabelle' interesting and captivating. I recommend this video to all  sensual people!",954806400,18,812,5.083333333333333
7888136,5,6305340595,"Considering the time period, I did not expect the depth of love or erotisism that this film so cleverly and masterfully has shown.  If you have ever loved someone that is no longer in your life and have memories  that haunt you, this movie has successfully depicted those thoughts and  feelings.  The only unbelievable part of the movie was the ""lesbian  lust"" of Isabelle--obviously she wants us to know that she is  heterosexual.  But this can be overlooked as Therese's acting (played by  Emmy Person) is superb and leads you into her private thoughts and feelings  as if you were living her life.  This film is a poignient, moving and  haunting piece that will not be forgotten.  A classic masterpiece.  I  highly reccommend it!",938822400,,732,4.798387096774194
