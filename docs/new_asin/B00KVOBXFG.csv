8661919,4,B00KVOBXFG,"I had a funny experience while watching this concert. I kept thinking I was hearing the work of composers other than the ones featured. Well, the Ravel sounded like Ravel, but the Mozart made me think of Beethoven, and the Beethoven brought to mind Bruckner!

This is due to conductor Daniel Barenboim's post-Romantic leanings. For example, the lightness and lilt evident in the ""authentic"" approach to Mozart are not really present here. If that's what you're looking for, you'll want to adjust your expectations. That's not to say the playing is insensitive or roughshod, because Barenboim (at the piano for the Piano Concerto No. 13) is beautifully delicate in the andante second movement. It's just that the forward drive of the piece and combined power of the modern orchestra are emphasized.

That's even more evident in Beethoven's Symphony No. 3. As I mentioned, it made me think of Bruckner at times -- particularly in the second movement, when Barenboim and the Berlin Philharmonic players achieve the ""cathedral of sound"" effect that is so intrinsic to Bruckner. Barenboim is a prominent Bruckner conductor, so perhaps that's not too surprising. Does it make Beethoven's work too heavy? Some might make that argument, but the approach works for me. (Apparently, age has mellowed and deepened Barenboim's approach to large-scale works, based on more recent performances captured on Blu-ray, such as this fully satisfying Brahms Symphony No. 1:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Berliner-Philharmoniker-Wagner-Elgar-Brahms-Blu-ray/dp/B0040Y7EV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Berliner Philharmoniker: Wagner, Elgar, Brahms [Blu-ray</a>].)

Speaking of mellow, the first piece in this Blu-ray's program, Ravel's Le Tombeau de Couperin, is expertly played and has many beautiful moments.

Considering the year of the performance (1997), I was quite happy with the picture quality of this Blu-ray, of which I received a review copy. Although it's a bit coarse and lacks that extra level of detail we've come to expect from high definition, the 16:9 image is very good for a concert of this vintage. The DTS-HD 5.1 sound is also good, providing a full dynamic range, albeit with less texture than current recordings.

The Blu-ray also contains a 19-minute documentary that was produced for the original telecast's intermission segment. It covers France's classical music scene, past and present, with a focus on Versailles, the setting for this concert. It also includes an interview with Barenboim, who talks at some length about how Furtwangler influenced him and the orchestra. This documentary is a nice bonus, even though the picture quality isn't great. It's been reformatted from 4:3 to 16:9 to fill HDTV screens (someone forgot to tell the graphic artist, since the cover art still says 4:3).",1433635200,,2842,5.554272517321016
8661920,5,B00KVOBXFG,"Firstly, I imported this performance on laserdisc from Japan, back in the day. I was quite impressed with Versailles as a performance venue, borne out in other recordings from there by flautists Patrick Gallois (1985) and Jean-Pierre Rampal (1994), both also on laserdisc. Here the Berliner Philharmoniker bring a somewhat stripped-down ensemble for the kinds of pieces that work in this venue. The Ravel is ravishing; the Mozart piano concerto among the finest on video even now nearly eighteen years later; the Beethoven is a great performance.
Secondly, I got the DVD as part of a set of four. The first set of DVDs (1991-1995) was in Dolby Digital 2.0, the bane of classical music; the second set (1996-1999) was in LPCM and sounded noticeably better. The LPCM did not improve on the laserdisc, but was equally listenable. I liked the way the anamorphic widescreen improved on the letterboxing of the laserdisc.
Thirdly, after a period of uncertainty, I got the blu-ray. I feared that triple-dipping meant I was a gullible oaf. When the blu-ray arrived, I played the whole DVD through to check it out. Then I popped the blu-ray in. The picture was only a little better on the blu-ray, but the sound was a blow-out. Wow, what a difference! Why the LPCM on the blu-ray sounds so much better than the LPCM on the DVD, I do not know. There probably is some technical reason for it. I just know that I played the whole blu-ray through with better appreciation than the DVD. The piano especially seemed to benefit on the blu-ray, but the orchestra too was less congested in tutti passages. I liked the stereo LPCM track on the blu-ray better than the DTS-HD MA 5.1 track.
I am listening to the 1999 performance conducted by Haitink now. I thoroughly approve of this blu-ray series of Europakonzerte.",1418601600,,1797,4.781350482315113
8661921,4,B00KVOBXFG,"This disc from the 1997 continues the popular series of annual concerts aimed at celebrating the founding of the BPO in May 1882. It continues the tradition of being held in a venue of musical and European significance. That significance is the subject of the interesting 20 minute documentary that explores the musical history of Versailles.

This particular disc offers a technical improvement over the 1994 concert from a recording point of view and both are significantly better than the 1991 and 1992 concerts. The imaging of this concert is now crisper and better defined even on the longer shots. The sharpening has been overdone though and the colours are over-saturated. The format is now 16.9 and the sound is presented in both DTS Master Audio surround sound and stereo. This re-mastering can be described as a reasonably successful upgrade from the previous DVD version even if it, not surprisingly, still falls short of the very latest imaging technology. This is still very much an SD television broadcast and it does show.

The programme starts with Ravels tribute to Couperin, an important composer at Versailles, with his orchestral version of the Tombeau de Couperin. Those who know the original piano version will be aware that the orchestral version omits two of the movements from the piano original. The performance here shows much sensitivity and is a satisfying delivery.

Mozart also was associated with France in his younger years, although he formed a complete dislike of Paris society and its musical tastes. The choice of the early 13th piano concerto is therefore an apt decision. Barenboim directs from the piano and delivers a dramatic and relatively forceful account of the work. Although far more dramatic and forceful than anything that the young Mozart would have had in mind, the music is completely capable of responding to such an approach and is, once more, a satisfying performance.

The concert concludes with Beethovens 3rd symphony, the Eroica, and here the link with Versailles is through the musics link with Napoleon. This large-scale work is given an appropriately large-scale reading. This is achieved through weight of phrasing rather than steady tempi. Furthermore there is no doubling of the brass or woodwind so the scale of concept is kept within a standard modern, but not chamber, orchestra. Aided by attentive a precise playing from the orchestra this is, once again, a very satisfying reading.

The bonus documentary is also well worth viewing as it pulls together all the threads of the concert items by linking the three works to the venue. This is also presented in 16:9 even though the cover states 4:3 format.

This adds up to a very worthwhile issue which enhances the original DVD issue to a clear extent. By 1997 the source recorded material had improved markedly since the early 1990s so the transfer to Blu-ray with careful re-mastering enables this issue to be far more successful technically than the earliest issues in the series.

Barenboim and the orchestra deliver a very good set of performances and as the recording is perfectly satisfactory for all but those intent on the latest HD resolutions, this disc is likely to give satisfaction to all those who find the programme of interest. In effect it offers three good performances in re-mastering which offers an SD television broadcast for Blu-ray playback..",1406678400,,3385,5.077338129496403
