8333634,5,B001PL3EEW,Beautiful Movie on Saint Maximilian Kolbe.  It is not just about the Saint it is about the story surrounding the great sacrifice of Martyrdom of the WWII Saint.,1421280000,,160,4.714285714285714
8333635,5,B001PL3EEW,"For me, K. Zannusi is one of the last true artists in the world cinema and one of the four best film directors that have ever emerged from Poland (others are Wajda, Kieslowski and Polanski). Life For Life, as in other  Zannusi's films, deals with difficult moral and religious dilemas and this time the scene is 1942 Poland, Aushwitz. The story of self-sacrifice in the hunger pit of the franciscan priest Maximilian Kolbe is a shattering experience of human tragedy. There is no point in telling more and one has to see this great movie. Highly recommended.",1392854400,,558,4.752577319587629
8333636,5,B001PL3EEW,"Though it is in German, it captured the goodness of Kolbe's life as well as those affected by him.  Kolbe sacrificed his life for another man and he did it happily and humbly.  This movie shows most of what I read of this modern day saint.",1245715200,6,239,4.173913043478261
