8181454,3,B000NV7NZG,"Maybe a little outdated but still relevant, for the most part. Dr. Dunbar is highly respected in his field.",1422748800,,107,4.684210526315789
8181455,4,B000NV7NZG,"This seems to be a pretty good introduction to dog training for someone who has never had any experience training a dog.  We also watched ""Train Your Dog - The Positive Gentle Method"", which seemed complementary to this but goes into more details with more examples.  We're also attending a training class at Petsmart that uses the same techniques.  We are having good results with our new ~1 year old lab/blue lacie mix, but it does take dedication and commitment.",1416700800,5,465,4.7875
8181456,5,B000NV7NZG,This was a clear presentation of training dogs. It took the mystery out of training. I now know that I can successfully train my dog. Yes ! ! ! !,1384732800,2,145,3.8666666666666667
8181457,4,B000NV7NZG,"I have read books and watched videos trying to find help for my elderly fear aggressive dog,  She is a loving lady until another female dog comes near.  She gets so upset she actually foams at the mouth.

This guy has a natural understanding and easy way of communicating.  The video was excellent.  The work is still up to you.  There is no magic pill.  But if you follow his lead you will begin to get a handle on how to help your dog through whatever your problem is.

The videos are a little dated, but the information is not.",1379721600,11,530,4.23
8181458,5,B000NV7NZG,"No distractions ....all dog training....wish only that dr. Dunbar had also mentioned use of clicker training....
Dr. Dunbar is an accomplished & convincing dog trainer....",1374105600,6,171,5.88
8181459,4,B000NV7NZG,"This is more of an overview of basic dog training, but I was hoping for a bit more in-depth ""how-to."" I did like that he showed how confusing it is to our dogs when we first begin giving commands that they don't understand. Excellent demonstration. Also, that he made the training fun for both the dogs and their human counterparts.",1350518400,14,332,4.55
8181460,5,B000NV7NZG,"I found this video to be very helpful.  In this video Ian Dunbar shows basic obedience techniques with the help of people and dogs taking one of his classes.  I liked that the techniques were demonstrated on a variety of dogs with novice owners, and not by a professional trainer with his own dog.  Ian shows a kinder gentler way to train a dog that is very effective.  The sit,down,sit stay exercise at the beginning of the program was very helpful with my poodle puppy, and the attention exercise at the end made a huge difference with my German Sheppard. I have trained dogs before, and most training works if you are consistent, but the advantage to Ians' methods are that they are fun for the dog and you can start training your dog as a young puppy.",1338422400,16,755,4.449275362318841
