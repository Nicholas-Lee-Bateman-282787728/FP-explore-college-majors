I was hoping to get a good quality film featuring our MASCOT but unfortunately everything that I have been able to find so far is rather poor quality.  Ms Del Rio was famous for her ""Behind"" and again unfortunality the collection here is lacking!  It is Hard Core!",1265328000,2,387,4.202702702702703
