8150897,2,B000JJJA4O,"I bought On Faith and Reason because I liked Genesis so much. I did not like On Faith and Reason nearly as much. I think this is a function of the people Moyers interviews. Most of them do not discuss the topic; the pull between faith and reason. Most of them seen to be there to promote their own books. And unlike Genesis, some of them are eye-glazing boring.",1397347200,,361,4.246376811594203

8150899,4,B000JJJA4O,Very good! Thought provoking! I was inspired when I watched a number of these episodes when they first aired on PBS.,1385337600,,116,4.571428571428571
8150900,5,B000JJJA4O,My favorite DVD in this collection is Mary Gordon / Colin McGinn. Gordon has confirmed my atheistic thoughts and McGinn has underscored my personal reasons for continuing church membership in a Christian Orthodox faith. Ain't it fun when things work backwards?,1368835200,,260,5.365853658536586
8150901,5,B000JJJA4O,"This series of interviews of authors who have wrestled with considerations on the nature of God (or if there is one) and humanity's relationship with the divine is so thoughtful and provocative it could stand alone as one's only theological reference. The people who are interviewed range from solidly atheistic to devout believing. These are not shallow enthusiasts pushing narrow arguments. Instead, they are thoughtful, well-studied, articulate people sharing their own struggles to understand the universe we live in through the lense of their own life's experience. One could view this series repeatedly. A terrific addition to any library. Just don't let it sit on the shelf.",1165968000,9,681,5.373831775700935
