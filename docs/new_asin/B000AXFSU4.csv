8080040,5,B000AXFSU4,"4 out of 5 ninjas surnamed McGoogle appreciate the technical merit, historic authenticity and general asskickitude of Irish American Ninja.  Let this morality tale be a lesson to all parents: Never name your sons Gertrude... unless you have a younger offspring named George on hand to rear in the way of the ninja and are prepared to discover him bound for Japan to seek vengeance for his father's lopped-off head.

P.S. Never let your children watch ninja movies.

P.P.S. If you do let them watch ninja movies, don't be surprised if they grow up delusional about their ability to breath under water or disappear... or perfom double deheadings.

P.P.P.S.  Expect them to turn to filmmaking as a means of expressing their delusions and psychological trauma.

P.P.P.P.S.  When the film they make is entitled Irish American Ninja, call all your friends and tell them to buy it immediately!

Don't forget to check out the killer bonus features!
