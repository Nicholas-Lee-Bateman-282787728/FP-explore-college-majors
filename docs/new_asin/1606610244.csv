8324492,2,1606610244,"The description of this DVD is... somewhat accurate. There are techniques presented in the video but little in the ways of instruction. I doubt GM Clarence was instructed in this manner as there are FEW details. Beginning martial artist might find it extremely difficult to become an adequate practioner with this sample of random techniques and footage thrown together with no basics to build from. Seasoned martial artists will be able to pick up the pinans and glean a useful technique or two but this is far from a ""complete"" presentation. Better look elsewhere.",1338768000,3,566,5.031914893617022
