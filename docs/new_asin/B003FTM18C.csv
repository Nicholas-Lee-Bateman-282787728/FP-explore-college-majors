4119183,4,B003FTM18C,"Uwe Boll has made some really bad movies ,this is not one of them. It's a decent little movie and the lead actors performances really help the film rise above the script even. The movie is suspensful and Luke Perrys subtle performance is quite good , Lauren Holly and Steve bacic also do really good jobs in this one. The newby kid actor also lands a solid performance. Don't believe the really bad reviews here the film with little budget lends to a sense of dread and you just don't know who or what the stranger is until the last few minutes which is good. He could be a angel, a demon, a ghost , or something else entirely. at first he's there to  help but is he there to help the family or not?  These answers aren't answered until the end and that proves that Boll has created a decent movie. If you want fast moving sci fi flick this isn't it, however the characters ringe true and this is not a disaster of a movie as one reviewer said, instead it's a solid little flick with solid actors who deliver the character driven goods.  the dvd print looks decent and  you would expect no less with a newer movie.  Which is a good thing.",1290384000,,1138,4.25
4119184,1,B003FTM18C,"Be thankful if you watch this on a Showtime premium cable channel, because if you spend cash on renting it you would probably become angry.  It is a low cost production with mediocre writing and a poor story line.  But Lauren Holly is, as always, lovely to look at.  Horror, sci fi, thriller ....who knows what category this flick belongs in.  If you have an alternative, take it.",1290211200,,380,4.544117647058823
4119185,1,B003FTM18C,This movie has no plot!  IT has has NO story other then some unkown end of the world theme.  IT HAS THE WORST ending I have ever seen!,1290211200,,134,3.75
4119186,4,B003FTM18C,"This film may be a little deeper than most may comprehend in respect to the build up of the surprise ending.  It's like a 1 hour plus Twilight Zone episode.  I admit the special effects could have been a bit more extravagant but the vague storyline and many unanswered questions of what put the characters in such a predicament is actually what gives the film it's gravity.  When the director brings them to their final confrontation you should begin to understand it's erie cross between the choices we make in life, politics, religion, and science of what we are eventually heading towards within faiths, global  civilization, and our galaxy.  If space and time can be curved and bent, no one can properly predict our demise as a cluster of stars in the Milkyway which has a black hole at it's center.  Scientist tell us the universe is expanding but in contrast the great view our solar system has of the universe from being located on the outer reaches of one of it's spiral arms is actually being pulled back into the center of that massive black hole as we speak.  Black holes warp time and space so we can't predict precisely when this will happen and we are spinning into it like water going down a drain.  There is no escape for anything or anyone.  The greatest horror of all.  A Final Storm is what's within the imbalanced conscientiousness of our spiritual soul as if being placed in purgatory still seeking answers to the questions of life and our own personal judgment.  This film is not for everyone but if you're a sci-fi buff capable of blending your quantitive imagination to it, it's worth a gander.",1290038400,2,1618,4.6223776223776225
4119187,1,B003FTM18C,"I just watched this movie.  It was HORRIBLE.  Do not waste your time.  The title is very misleading.  There is a storm and it takes part during the first 5 minutes of the movie and then it is gone.  The story line does not exist.  There is a ""sex"" scene in it, and that is why it probably got an R rating, and maybe the director thought that would keep people watching it, but don't waste your time.",1285804800,,399,4.051282051282051
4119188,4,B003FTM18C,"Perhaps it was the negative or so-so reviews of ""The Final Storm"" which lowered my expectations of the movie but I was totally engrossed and awed by it!  I will not spoil it by giving away the plotline but it has traces of ""The Road"" and ""Cold Creek Manor"" running through it from start to finish.  The acting and storyline are first rate and the direction is near flawless.  It is very rare that a film which deals with an end of the world scenario relies on an eerily thrilling story instead of an overabundance of FX and bloodshed.  I highly recommend ""The Final Storm"" to any film lovers who are looking for a well paced end of days movie which contains mystery as well as suspense in a neat, fast moving hour and one half package.",1278374400,4,735,4.343065693430657
4119189,3,B003FTM18C,Not really what I was expecting- slow moving.,1277683200,,45,4.75
4119190,2,B003FTM18C,"Uwe Boll is back adding another disaster to his filmography.
Ultimately the movie makes no sense and its slow meandering pace has no climactic payoff.  Why has everyone but our three leads and a handful of ruffians vanished?  Where did they go?  Who is Silas really?  Tim McGregor's script is far too ambiguous and unbelievable and Boll's direction pedestrian.  Oddly enough, the performances from Steve Bacic, Lauren Holly and Luke Perry rise above the material.  I vow to avoid any more Boll movies!",1275523200,2,501,4.975903614457831
4119191,3,B003FTM18C,"Final Storm is better than most straight to video movies, but still doesn't totally satisfy.  While I'm not a fan of the controversial Uwe Boll, I have to admit that he did a solid job directing this film.

Boll pairs up experienced TV actor Steve Bacic with Lauren Holly, who still looks hot despite knocking on 50's door.  Throw Luke Perry in the mix as their mysterious visitor Silas, and you've got a movie that stands apart from Boll's other work.

So why is a movie with a decent cast, score and directing only getting three stars?  The writing is inconsistent.  There are two plot lines that pull you in and keep you interested: The apocalyptic changes taking place, and the identity of the strange visitor.  My complaint is that the apocalypse story line is all but abandoned as the film progresses.  You never get an explanation as to why some people vanish, yet others don't.  And while the movie's ending is concrete, it still doesn't answer any questions.

I can sum this movie up in two words: Lost Potential.  It's really intriguing from the start, but the characters all seem oddly detached from the possibility that the world might end.  By the film's conclusion, you'll still be scratching your head over why certain things were happening in the movie.  Final Storm had the potential of a five-star movie, had the writing delivered on all of the mystery created at the start.  Watch the movie once before you consider buying the DVD.",1273708800,26,1450,4.7023809523809526

The plot is filled with so many holes as to be practically indecipherable.  (This coming from a woman who enjoyed watching ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" one of the most outlandishly camp moves ever made. A movie so bad that Bela Lugosi died while filming it.)

Luke Perry plays a (husband, father) nice guy extraordinaire, who's a few cards shy of a full deck.  Lauren Holly plays salt of the earth (wife, mom) trying to remain brave as the universe shuts down around her.  With a better plot and more even script this movie might have come off ... but it doesn't even come close.  What could have been an interesting picture comes off as stupid, dull, boring and increasingly painful to watch.

A storm to end all storms hits the planet ... then all the animals vanish along with almost all the humans on the planet.  (But the bad guys are out there - don't ask me why)  A scruffy confused stranger shows up at Luke and Lauren's home ... around the same time their beloved dog runs out into the storm.  Then ALL the lights go out ... along with everything else electrical.  The movie just goes downhill from there.  The movie ends suddenly when the world ends ... without any explanation.

4119292,1,B003FTM18C,Its really a zero star movie but you cant give zero stars so it gets one.  I don't know what the storm was because you never find out and most of the movie is wasted on absolutely stupid sex scenes that had absolutely nothing to do with the movie.  Sometimes a movie is dumb enough to be funny but this one couldn't even manage to be funny.

You have a family that is on a farm. First all of the animals leave. Then the last neighbor disappears. A strange man arrives and says it was his home. They go into town and there are no people. Zero. Just this family and the guy. Eventually, it's discovered that he had lived on the farm (like 30 years before...and he's way too young for that), had killed his dad. He tries to do the same to the father of this family. But his son saves him and then the earth ends. The end. It's ridiculous, convoluted with no resolution or understanding to the plot lines.

Supernova sun meets prophet ezekeil so many unexplained plot holes and less than no character development made any 5 rating you see suspect at best. I have usurious doubts about their ability to function in a rational logical world.

Of course creationist an send of time fanatic aren't troubled by those constraints of Aristotelian logic.

I have great concerns about the fact that low budget film making can be used to crank out end of times films disguised as science fiction crime thrillers.

The crime is that Netflix gives a broad platform for this marginalized group to promulgate  this type of dogmatic propaganda. Oh by the way Leni R did it far better and with remarkable style, camera work and editing. This one was rushed to the que before the emulsion dried on the film.(figuratively speaking, 35 mm film would have been far too costly for this waste of cinema.)

If it was so bad why did you watch it?  Right, I agree just wanted to make certain that watching would be a fate worse than death.

The title caught my eye to start with.  I'm a sucker for natural disaster movies.  Well, I was disappointed.

After a short while, ""everyone"" disappears, which we eventually find out isn't true, the ""bad guys"" are still there.  There is no explanation for it.  Add onto this that all the animals disappeared as well.  I didn't plan on watching a ""rapture"" movie.  Thankfully, that was never mentioned.

A stranger appears from the dark.  They take him in and let him stay.  Really?  The husband even leaves him in the house with his wife and son while running to the neighbors in search of a truck.

The story just goes downhill from there.  The movie just ends.  No explanation, nothing.  Thankfully I did not pay money to see this, beyond the Prime Membership, which I got for the shipping.",1464480000,11,966,4.704819277108434

Even so, I stuck with it thinking it may be about something else. It was not.  I gave it a two out of generosity. There is some bias on my part. I lived in New Orleans and witnessed the suffering of others as well as myself due to the hurricane. You wouldn't believe the ignorant people who told me that it was G-d's punishment for what was considered ""the evil ways of the residents"". One Minister even told that ""God pinched the nostrils shut"" on a little girl in the Lower Ninth who drowned. It was appalling. I felt like slapping his face for the horrible image he left me with.

4120131,4,B003FTM18C,"THE
FINAL STORM

I will admit right here and now that I am a Uwe Boll fan, yes you read that right. I will admit that some of films [mainly ones based on video games{but not all of those}] are not that great. But with that said he has made some really good ones. Films like Postal which is based on a game and Rampage among others come to mind. Luckily when this one was released it turned out to be a really good one.

Tom and Gillian Grady is a couple who live outside a small town on a farm that Toms dad once owned with their son. They are a nice and keep to themselves type of people trying to make their new situation work. As luck would have it there is a storm that rolls in that lasts forever it seems. During this storm a man wanders onto their land and eventually to them, they help the man out. Once he is awake the man starts speaking of the end of the world and terrible things happening in the town. Things seem to be going like the man is saying as the Gradys neighbors seem to be missing along with other things out of place. So is this man right about everything and could he be the help they need, or is there a much darker side to this guy, a murderous side?

I have to say that I really enjoyed this little thriller here from Boll and writer Tim McGregor. This end of the world flick is a cool little low budget affair with strong performances from its cast. Steve Bacic, Lauren Holly and Cole Heppell are great as the Grady family and seem very natural together. Luke Perry is great as well as the stranger that wanders into these peoples lives. It is a very small cast but that is what makes it work.

Now I have read reviews in which people say the vanishings and apocalypse thing are never explained but that is not true. If you pay attention it is clear as day and makes perfect sense, all I will say is know your Bible. If you know anything that Perrys character is talking about here then you will get that ending. So with that said I really did enjoy this film even though I am sure some will disagree with me on it. You get a really informative commentary from Boll here in which I think he is a little too hard on his own film. Also an alternate ending that zombie fans might like, I prefer the one they went with.",1386201600,12,2245,4.095454545454546
4120132,3,B003FTM18C,"Kinda interesting...plot was pretty good. Acting was believable even if the storyline was a little hard to follow.
If Lauren Holly would have shown her nekkid sweater puppies, her goody box or both, I would have watched this one again. She didn't and the movie suffered from it.
C'mon Lauren show them things...everybody is doing it!",1350432000,,333,4.964285714285714
4120133,3,B003FTM18C,"This movie wasn't great and it wasn't horrible. Just something you watch if either you catch it and nothing else is on or if you like one of the main characters. There's not reason to watch beyond that.

The plot had a lot of potential. Supposedly it's the end of the world and everyone is wiped out by a storm. Tom (Steve Bacic), his wife (Lauren Holly) and their teen son soon realize they might be the only ones left in their little country town. Then one stormy night a stranger, Silas (Luke Perry) pops up out of nowhere and to Tom's dismay, the couple offers Silas a place to stay. Soon strange things start happening, Silas begins to get uncomfortably attached to Tom's family and Tom asks him to leave.

That's it in a nutshell. But, the point was supposed to be that the storm wiped out everyone yet you wouldn't know that by the characters' actions. We get no scenes outside of their little home or farm except one time when they go into town and finally see that everyone is gone except some looters. There is nothing shot to show evidence of people vanishing and the film didn't delve into the reason for the storm. Was it apocalyptic or not? I blame the writers because they did a horrible job with this. What we get is the storm being some kind of excuse to make this film seem different when all you get is some USA made-for-cable movie with D-movie stars. The plot is what makes you wanna watch but once you see it, you realize this is no more about the end of the world than watching Charlotte's Web.

I must admit I had mixed feelings, that's why I gave it three stars. I kind of liked this movie because I did find the couple interesting. Tom and Gillian are having problems in their marriage and he's a drunk. Silas becomes attracted to Gillian (why I don't know) and wants to take her away from Tom which brings out some soap opera drama. So though the plot failed big time, the conflict between the characters kept me watching. Luke Perry and Steve Bacic are good but Lauren Holly was a mirror of her former lively self. She was draggy, boring and drab. I also found it hard to concentrate when she was in the room because I could not believe how she's altered her appearance. I barely recognized her with her collagen lips and boob job. It was embarrassing to see Holly, who used to be an attractive women in her own right, do such a drastic change. She looked horrible and her alteration makes her look much older than she is. She looked old enough to be Tom's mother. She had no emotion and mumbled through her dialogue probably because she can no longer move her lips.

Luke Perry, well it's hard to see how he ever was a famous heartthrob but those days are gone and he's been in D-movie land since. But he is a good actor, much better than in his 90210 days. He did a good job as Silas though his character was one dimensional and badly written. I've never heard of Steve Bacic before but he kept me wanting to watch. He seemed to be the only actor who found his part interesting. He kept the fires burning when this movie could've really been boring and it was slow enough.

Yes there is a mystery concerning Silas' character but I won't mention it in case you do watch the movie.

This is not the type of movie you should spend money on though. Wait until it comes on television and check it out. All you're getting is some badly put together TV movie. Though it's not horrible, and I liked some aspects of it, it's nothing no one has to see by all means.",1328832000,,3485,4.321100917431193
4120134,4,B003FTM18C,This was an intriguing movie. It was well acted. It was a great story. The only thing I didn't like was the resolution of the apocalyptic theme. Kind of cheesy. Watching Bacic throughout the film is quite a bonus. He's extraordinarily hot.,1326585600,,239,4.714285714285714
4120135,3,B003FTM18C,"Great cast, very good acting, but the plot was weak at best.  It started off very strong and then just tumbled down hill.  This movie is also a very good example of  why ""city"" people should not live in the country.  As someone who spent most of her live on 100 acres I have to say that being on a farm without backup resources such as fuel, a generator bigger than something sitting in a wheelbarrow, extra food stores, and other heavy mobile equipment is very rare.  Big thumbs down in believability from me in that department for this movie.  The ending of the movie was awful.  They give you a big lead up and the questions that you have at the beginning of the movie are never answered.",1318377600,,691,4.310077519379845
4120136,1,B003FTM18C,"This movie starts off in an attempt to scare and disturb you with weird weather patterns and chronic thunderstorms which have caused flooding in certain unspecified parts of America. It appears that the movie is going to be about the non-stop rain and the dangers of a deadly flood, but then the rain stops and that storyline is dropped and forgotten.

Then the movie takes a different direction when the main characters all go into town and it's found that almost everyone has disappeared. It's an intriguing mystery and one that's worth investigating, but shortly after this plot twist is introduced the director seems to grow tired of it and it's never followed up on.

Most of the movie is spent on a creepy stranger named Silas and his awkard relationship with the Grady family.

There's awkward and disturbing competition between Silas and Tom Grady for the alfa-male status in the Grady household and annoying Bible preaching. This drags on slowly for what SEEMS like about three hours, but in reality is probably thirty or forty minutes.

And while I don't want to give the ending away in a review I will say that the ending is bad. It's really, really bad. It's quite possibly the dumbest and most pointless conclusion to a movie I've ever seen.",1315699200,3,1254,4.764976958525345
4120137,1,B003FTM18C,"You got your crazy person movie in my end-of-the-world movie!  You got your end-of-the-world movie in my crazy person movie!  Hey.... Two crappy films that taste crappy together!

Seriously, this is a movie with an identity crisis.  One hour, twenty-seven minutes of apocalypse followed by eight minutes of ""crazy guy uses crow bar to open can of whoop-ass"" wrapped up by fifteen seconds of ""well I'll be gosh-darned, Gladys- it IS the apocalypse!""  And then they all get sucked up into the rapture.  At least that's what I think it is.  God squishes out all the stars or something in about ten seconds of otherwise unexplained (and poorly executed) CGI.

What does it all mean?  It hardly seems fair that they went to all the trouble of beating the crap out of the homicidal maniac and setting him on fire if the world picks that EXACT SAME MOMENT to get repossessed by the Almighty.  They could have saved themselves the trouble if they had just known.  Why have a fight to the death if death is a couple minutes away and inescapable?  I'd just have ask him to kindly put down the crowbar and have a nice cup of tea while we wait to be reduced to our component atoms.  Of course, at the time they weren't aware that God was clicking ""Yes"" on the Universe's ""Do you really want to shut down?"" window.  But still.

There might be some zombies in this movie.  I wasn't sure if the townies were just your run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic goon squad or a herd of shambling undead.  Honestly, it really didn't matter.  It would take more than zombies to save this film.

P.S. Just so that I don't end on a negative, it's only fair to mention that the actors did the best they could with the hand they were dealt.  Kudos to them for giving it 110% even though they must have known how badly it would turn out.  That's real professionalism.",1311638400,4,1834,4.513677811550152
4120138,2,B003FTM18C,"My Tivo is an interesting beast.  It loves to recommend movies for reasons that are known only to its algorithm. And to be fair, I do watch a lot of sci-fi apocalyptic movies, so when The Final Storm showed up in the queue I took the bait. Which is why I didn't know the movie was produced by...

Uwe Boll.

That's a test.  Anyone who hates him has probably moved on. For the rest of us willing to give the movie a chance, here's the review:

The oddly mismatched Gradys consist of scruffy husband Tom (Steve Bacic), wide-eyed hottie Gillian (Lauren Holly) and their son Graham (Cole Heppell). Living alone on a farm, they hunker down during a terrible storm, only to discover they've lost all contact with the neighbors.  Never mind that the neighbors' trailer is clearly visible across the street and at no point does anyone decide to walk over and knock on a door - it's the apocalypse, so get with the program.

As the family frets between staying and leaving, a stranger awakens in their midst with no memory of his past.  That stranger is none other than Luke Perry as Silas Hendershot, looking for work and enunciating all his lines like an Amish farmer. Something terrible has happened in the outside world, and Hendershot slowly undermines Tom's role as patriarch by being stalwart, dependable, and helpful around the house.  When things go south, it seems hardworking men will once again become a desirable commodity.

But Tom isn't going to go down without a fight. Surly, often drunk, and prone to stupid explorations on his own, Tom discovers that the nearby town is filled with violent thugs. There's evidence everywhere that people just disappeared.  What happened?

It becomes clear that Hendershot's intentions are less than pure towards Mrs. Grady, that Mrs. Grady's thoughts are less than pure, and that the reason the good, honest farm-folk have been left behind in the wake of an evident Rapture is because...wait for it...they are all less than pure.  In short, this is actually a biblical tale in which the moral fortitude of each character is tested.

The problem with The Final Storm, besides the acting, potholed plot, and logic flaws, is that the audience expects an apocalyptic tale and ends up with a psychological thriller. When The Final Storm tries to be apocalyptic, it feels conveniently claustrophobic. There aren't many actors in the film, and the fact that the farm house just doesn't seem as isolated as it should makes it difficult to buy into the characters' decision to stay at the house.  When The Final Storm strives for a Cape Fear-style psychological thriller it's measurably better, bolstered by the aforementioned apocalyptic ruin just outside the farmhouse walls.

The ending makes no sense whatsoever unless you buy into the biblical propaganda Hendershot spouts throughout the film.  Since he's a character we're inclined to distrust, The Final Storm doesn't earn its surprise twist.  But for those who are willing to stick with it, The Final Storm delivers a somewhat disjointed dialogue on the measure of the human soul.",1297814400,2,3072,4.897683397683398
4120139,2,B003FTM18C,"This movie came SO close to being something decent, which is surprising considering Uwe Boll's name was attached. It seemed like he was trying for a character-driven story about a fractured family struggling to reconnect in the face of the (apparent) end of the world, and for the first two acts that's what viewers get. It's not perfect in its execution, but it's promising enough.

Then the third act comes along, and the plot thread involving Luke Perry's character takes such a wild left turn it derails everything the filmmakers built up earlier. It certainly wasn't a predictable twist, but from a characterization standpoint it made no sense, and the climax as a result feels like a huge letdown.

Overall this was more palatable than most of Uwe Boll's movies, but a botched ending rather ruined the whole thing for me.",1294185600,,827,4.858156028368795

After the storm dies down, all the animals and most of the people in the town, apart from a few vagabonds, are also gone. At this point the concept of the last days also dies down.

From here on in it turns into a mild thriller, where the objective is no longer to find all the missing people or animals, but to find out who Silas (Luke Perry) really is.
