544390,4,6303039227,"Rainbow Valley, 1934 film

A man enters a store to buy clothes, a revolver, and a horse. He is going to Rainbow Valley, about 60 miles away. He sees a man on foot who needs water for Nelly (his automobile). He delivers the mail. Four men on horses pursue and shoot at him! The stranger stops those four men. ""Why don't they build the road?"" Gunmen drive away the workmen. [For what reason?] The people in town need to defend themselves, and prepare a petition for the Governor. The postmistress hears about the attempted stickup. A crowd gathers to watch the fight. They need a fighter like John Martin. Can he guard the workmen on the road? If the road can't go through the miners will sell out for a low price. What organization is behind that gang? John will take charge of the road-building crew.

Work goes on, they have watchmen don duty. When that gang approaches, shots are fired as a warning. The armed workmen drive off that gang. So do sticks of dynamite! The postmistress thanks John. ""Reach for the sky"" says one of the gang to George as they hijack his automobile. John reads the clues in the dirt road and finds the gang's headquarters. He rescues George and his automobile, they make their getaway. In town a man gets into the Post Office to take a letter addressed to the governor. He reads the signatures, and replaces the letter with one that asks for a pardon for Austin Galt! Later works stops due to a lack of dynamite. Butch is freed! We learn about John Martin's past, the word gets out. John goes to meet Butch. Does this look bad? John asks for men and dynamite to fix the road.

The townspeople meet, they must put an end to the gang. They arm themselves with rifles. In town a letter from the Governor identifies John Martin as an undercover agent who must be given ""utmost cooperation""! George must stop that mob of civilians who are running miles to reach the road-building project. The townsmen open fire on the gang. An explosion wipes out Butch's gang and opens the road so wagons can get through. The postmistress thanks John.

This is variation on the classic Western where a small group seeks to exploit and dominate a larger group of people. Thanks to one strong individual this plot is foiled, and prosperity will return to Rainbow Valley. [Unless there is another economic depression.] Towns that depended on mining alone were abandoned when the mines played out. The hero gets the girl and any other rewards offered. But what happened after a few years? Will compatibility grow due to different backgrounds and interests?",1373932800,,2561,4.6219780219780215

544392,5,6303039227,Rainbow Valley is a great classic John Wayne movie. I had to buy it for my John Wayne collection. I would recommend it to anyone that loves western movies and John Wayne.,1282435200,,170,4.34375
544393,2,6303039227,"If  your looking for a decent print of the 'ol John Wayne Lonestar Films, I wouldnot recommend this West Gate DVD.  You are probably better off with the Platinum / Echo Bridge series.",1278892800,,183,4.515151515151516
544394,2,6303039227,"Rainbow Valley like most other knock off prints is no better , if not worse that the Mill Creek or Platinum/ Echo Bridge copies. The story is good for early B westerms, but unfortunately quality suffers. Don't waste the extra money.",1276473600,,232,4.682926829268292
544395,3,6303039227,"""Rainbow Valley"" was the 13th of the B Westerns that young John Wayne did for Lone Star, which was part of the poverty row Monogram studio.  This 1935 film was directed by Robert N. Bradbury, who did most of Wayne's Lone Star efforts and has a rather interesting premise for a western.  Rainbow Valley needs a new railroad built through the gold country and Wayne plays undercover agent John Martin, who shows up to protect the workers.  Meanwhile, local big shot Mr. Rogers (LeRoy Mason) brings in a hired gun, Butch Galt (Jay Wilsey, aka Buffalo Bill, Jr.), who has crossed paths with Martin before.  It turns out they shared a prison cell together, so Galt thinks he can get Martin to help destroy the railroad with dynamite.
George Hayes, who did not quite have his ""Gabby"" persona developed at this point, gets second billing playing one of the locals while Lucile Browne is Eleanor, the minor love interest for Martin in this oater.  Who is missing from this Lone Star film is the legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt, which would explain why the stunt work is not as exciting as it usually is in these films.  Canutt is usually the attraction here and not Wayne, who is obviously the selling point for putting out these video copies of less than stellar prints.  By now in the series the idea that Wayne is working undercover and that the bad guys think he is an outlaw too is getting really old.  Only a true fan of the Duke is going to watch all of these, but most movie fans can stand to check out a couple to see what Wayne was like when he was learning his craft.",1088121600,11,1571,4.468531468531468

544527,5,6303039227,John Wayne never made a bad movie. He made early action westerns like Roy Rogers and others. Here he is an undercover government agent. Very entertaining.,1446336000,,154,4.961538461538462

This is a typical 30s 'B' movie, I think it probably should be considered as a 'training' film for the Star that John Wayne was destined to become and which he became.  I love all movies John Wayne.  Call me prejudiced. So, are you a stalwart enough Wayne fan to enjoy it, even though it is a 'B' movie???",1408838400,,475,3.968421052631579

And thats just how the local bad guys want to keep it, cutoff from the rest of the world (more importantly, the law).  Everything is going according to plan until Martin shows up to save George Hale (Gabby Hayes) from a band of ruffians.  The townsfolk want Martin on their side because hes tough enough.  The bad guys want him on their side..............or dead.  Misgivings and misunderstandings abound as everyone tries to figure out who Martin is and will he pick a side.  When its announced that hes an ex-con, everyone grabs their pistol and heads for the open road (in a manner of speaking).  If guns beat knives then dynamite trumps everything.

Except for postmistress Eleanor (Lucile Browne) there isn't another woman to be had.  Doesnt matter as long as Wayne gets the girl.  At least with these odds it wasn't going to be hit or miss.",1486944000,,990,4.568181818181818
