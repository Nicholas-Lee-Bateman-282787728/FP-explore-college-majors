6500202,4,B00LSW76MO,"""Dracula Untold"" cleverly reboots the familiar Dracula myth to give our cinematic vampire both a backstory as medieval warrior Vlad the Impaler and a sympathetic origin. Vlad, a former mercenary in the Turkish Army, is Prince of Transylvania and a loving husband and father. The annual Turkish demand for tribute brings with it a new requirement: 1,000 boys to man the Sultan's army. Vlad faces an impossible choice. A refusal to comply will bring on a war with the Turks he cannot win, but to give up his son is unthinkable. A desperate Vlad will be driven to a deal with the Devil...

The presentation is darkly atmospheric, and generally succeeds in making Vlad a sympathetic character. The costumes, scenery and special effects are exceptional. The fight scenes between Vlad and the Turkish Army are good, if repetitive. Unfortunately, we all know how this situation works out. The film does manage a decent ending with forebodings for the traditional modern Dracula stories. Recommended as good entertainment.",1413158400,3,1014,5.108433734939759
6500203,5,B00LSW76MO,"I was disappointed when I read some unflattering reviews about this much anticipated movie, but I decided to watch it anyway. Im so glad I trusted my gut instinct and didn't listen to the critics. Maybe I was just in the right mood to watch it, maybe my expectations were lowered, or maybe its just a good, solid movie  but I LOVED it!

It moved fast, never dragged, and I was riveted to the screen for every minute. It mostly had to do with Luke Evans. I wasn't familiar with him at all and when I watched the trailer I wasn't particularly taken with his looks, but he is mesmerizing on screen as Dracula. He has an intelligence about him, with lots going on behind those dark eyes. He perfectly conveyed suffering, tenderness and, yes, a monstrous dark side.

The plot wins points for creativity and remaking Dracula as a hero. The writers incorporated enough of real historical events (the Ottoman Empire, the Janissaries being composed of non-Turks, and Vlad the Impaler having been a royal hostage in his youth) to give this untold story some solid heft. There are some plot twists that made me scratch my head and the fact that all the Transylvanians had British accents, but I can forgive most anything in a movie if it entertains the heck out of me  and this one definitely did.

I cant not talk about the special effects  AMAZING! I was breathless with awe. This is the type of movie that demands to be seen on a big screen. This is what I want when I pay $11 at the box office.

Now about that intriguing ending  I smell a sequel. Pretty please!!!!",1413158400,454,1558,4.461267605633803
6500204,5,B00LSW76MO,"Great Movie, perfectly cast. It tells how the Dracula bloodline began, and shows his human side. While it's not a scary movie (12- and 13-year olds would probably be fine), I wouldn't advise letting the younger ones watch; some images may be too frightening for little kids. It's worth adding to your DVD/Blu-ray collection.",1413158400,2,324,5.018518518518518
6500205,4,B00LSW76MO,"This was not the typical blood-sucking vampire movie.  It was a story of a Prince who fought for many years of wars, to finally return home to his wfe, son, and the people of his kingdom, where he hoped to live out the remainder of his years (or at least the next 10) in peace.  But, it was not to be....

Prince Vlad had been called Vlad the Impailer because his prior war methods included impailing the bodies of his victims to rot.  Now times had changed and his army had apparently disbanded, with the exceptions of a few faithful soldiers.  Believing he and his kingdom were now vulnerable, the Turks demanded more than he was willing to gift and ""negotiations failed"".  In a last-ditch effort to save his family and his people, Vlad sought out some rather unorthodox methods to give him the edge.

There was lots of action, fighting, blood, and violence.  Not for the children, in my opinion, although I saw one there.

In this version, Vlad was the Prince who became Dracula to save his people and his family.  Luke Evans does a great job as the Prince.",1413072000,9,1060,4.473958333333333
6500206,4,B00LSW76MO,"Nine Things About the Movie Dracula Untold (USA, 2014)

1. This is yet another version of Dracula, that gets yet another origin story. But it's pretty decent, if you know what you're getting.

2. This is not your regular blood-sucking movie. This Dracula takes the semi-historical Vlad the Impaler route. Vlad is a prince who grew up captured and fighting for his enemies, the Turks.

3. Now back at home and ruling Transylvania, Vlad is threatened once again by the Turks. In order to save his people, he finds an ancient master vampire living in a Transylvanian mountain.

4. Vlad accepts a deal from the vampire, and begins his descent into darkness.

5. Vlad/Dracula is not evil in this movie, though he is an antihero. He is a physically and mentally traumatized man that feels a sociopathic duty to protect his people.

6. If you look at it right, this version of Dracula can be seen as a metaphor for war veterans with PTSD, trying (and ultimately failing) to keep their inner demons at bay.

7. A few characters from the original story make appearances in this movie; Mina appears briefly, and Vlad's gypsy servant Shkelgim is clearly the Renfield character.

8. The movie's atmosphere and cinematography are great. There are a few scenes that are absolutely, gorgeously gothic.

9. The movie touches on some deeper issues, but never explores them. So in the end, there's nothing about this movie that makes it particularly memorable. You watch it, then you go on with your life. But as an entertaining dark fantasy adventure, this is worth a look.",1413072000,200,1556,4.797752808988764
6500207,4,B00LSW76MO,"Luke Evans gives us a different type of Dracula, one I didn't expect. The childhood of Vlad is read to us. Vlad becomes the reluctant monster in order to have the strength to save his people from the Turks who are demanding 1,000 boys in addition to the tribute. Vlad enters into ""the immortal game of revenge"" to turn him into Uma Thurman on steroids.

I enjoyed the set up and the initial battle. The film slowed after that until the ending fight scenes which were anti-climatic at that point.

And what was that with vampires and silver? Silver is for werewolves. That made the whole film unbelievable.

No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1412985600,4,634,4.592920353982301
6500208,5,B00LSW76MO,"I was absorbed by this version. I think is one of the most pertinent versions where non-fictional history is presented and blended with legend and myths. You can find out (finally) some actual facts about the Romanian history (son and father) + the role of Turks in those times. Although the turk characters were not well selected (they don't look like Turks) the illustration of their power and methods is pretty accurate.

The storyline is clever, detail oriented, selling you the whole story in a very credible way.

From second one until the end, the movie kept my attention and implication. A popular story with a serious delivery. A well earned 5 stars, in my opinion.",1412985600,5,674,4.801724137931035
6500209,3,B00LSW76MO,"There's only a droplet of historical truth in Dracula Untold, a film that dares to take the king bloodsucker and give him a full-blown superhero origin. That's right, Dracula, once the scourge of Universal's classic array of movie monsters, is now on the side of the angels...which is weird considering his lack of soul and all. This version is a fearsome warrior, a defender of the innocent, a caring father and husband who gave up literally everything to protect his people. It's the Marvel-ization of Dracula in a PG-13, multiplex-ready package, but in exploring the myth of Vlad the Impaler the film offers plenty to sink your fangs into.

So how in the world do you make a guy named Vlad the Impaler a good guy? It seems like the kind of task any writer would balk at, but you do it by coming up with an enemy that's far worse or giving him a just cause to fight for. Luke Evans, whose chiseled features have been seen recently in Fast & Furious 6 and The Hobbit, plays Vlad before he becomes the Dracula we're all familiar with. Voiceover gives us his origin before the origin, recounting his time as the brutal slayer nicknamed ""The Impaler"", for reasons that are pretty obvious. But he's given up fighting and has retired home to Transylvania with his lovely wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and young son Ingeras (Art Parkinson). However when Turkish ruler Mehmet II (Dominic Cooper, looking none too Turkish) demands 1000 boys to fill his army's rank, Vlad does what any self-respecting leader would do. He climbs a mountain where he encounters he knows a vicious creature (Game of Thrones' Charles Dance) lurks, and enters into a Faustian bargain he may soon regret.

While we all know how Vlad's story will eventually turn out, Dracula Untold keeps us intrigued by the sheer desperation of his scheme. Granted incredible vampiric powers for three days, Vlad must also refuse to give in to the blood thirst that plagues every vampire. If he can deny it, he'll return to normal; but if not he'll be damned for eternity. The creature, credited simply as Master Vampire, is a trickster of sorts, gambling his own freedom on Vlad giving in to the lust for human blood.

It's the constant struggle for Vlad's soul that drives much of the story, as his family begins to fear him and so too the people he's sworn to protect. Glimpses of his evil future arise in brief flares of anger directed at his own soldiers, but Vlad's wrath is mostly reserved for Mehmet's army. Impressively scaled battles, murky and violent CGI showcases ala 300, nonetheless are pretty bloodless which may disappoint those looking for something more gruesome. They're in the wrong place if looking for horror thrills as debuting director Gary Shore has mapped out this story as an action flick, first and foremost. The visual effects are incredibly well done, from Vlad's ""radar vision"" to his ability to use transformation as a deadly battlefield weapon. Ever seen an entire battalion wiped out by a swarm of bats? You will in Dracula Untold and it looks spectacular.

There's very little connection to the Dracula we're familiar with, and the film works best when you forget everything that came before. If you can't, it may be tough to swallow that Dracula is really just a nice guy who made a noble, if tragic mistake. Evans is probably the most handsome Dracula to ever hit the screen and there's real passion in his performance. Other than Charles Dance who strikes a fine balance between mischievous and menacing, the rest of the cast barely register.

Designed as the beginning of Universal's newly-minted ""cinematic universe"" of classic monsters, Dracula Untold makes for a curious yet successful franchise-starter. Mostly it deserves credit for putting the teeth back into Dracula's well-worn story.",1412985600,37,3782,4.848297213622291
6500210,4,B00LSW76MO,"Drawing in equal measure from both Batman Begins and Game of Thrones, Dracula Untold functions as a 15th-century superhero origin story for the iconic title vampire.  This may not be a variation on the Dracula brand many people desired, but the film plays well as a piece of Gothic action/adventure escapism.  The story begins with Vlad III (the Impaler) retired from combat, quietly raising his family and reigning over a peaceful kingdom.  After a rival despot demands a thousand child soldiers, Vlad turns in desperation to a vampire known to hide on a nearby mountain, hoping to use the substantial power of the undead to defend his people.  A new vampire-mythology twist (or contrivance) is introduced to augment and simplify the drama:  if Vlad does not dine on human blood for three days, his transformation will not be permanent, but he will be forever damned if he sips from a vein.  So he fights to resist temptation and maintain his tenuous grip on humanity when he is not decimating invading armies in either human or bat form.

In general, Dracula Untold strongly emphasizes atmosphere and bluster over character development and thematic depth, but this is not a major problem when it comes to a cut-to-the-bone hour-and-a-half popcorn jaunt, particularly one with a well-timed October release.  It is rather a feast for the eyes, from the sweeping, overcast wide shots of picturesque rural Northern Ireland (standing in for period Transylvania) to the Hammer-horror art-direction flourishes, from crushed skulls to a tarantula to a host of ornate armor.  Though definitely neutered for a more accessible PG-13 rating, the action sequences are exciting and possess a scope indicative of a healthy budget, and the performances are more than fine for the genre, with the chiseled Luke Evans glowering capably in the lead role and the drop-dead gorgeous Sarah Gadon exuding wistful old-world elegance as his princess.",1412985600,2,1927,5.1309904153354635

True some historical facts were thrown in even if they were inaccurate for the most part.  I finally watched the movie and was greatly and pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it.  It does a descent job in fleshing out some of the backstory on Bram Stokers Count Dracula, but has him surviving into the current time whereas in the book he is destroyed by Johnathan Harker and Van Helsing.

6500224,4,B00LSW76MO,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Gary Shore, ""Dracula Untold tells the origin of Dracula: In the 15th century Prince Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) must protect his small kingdom of Wallachia (in modern-day Romania) from a Turk warlord (Dominic Cooper) who demands a thousand boys from Wallachia & Transylvania, including Vlads son. Threatened by the unsurmountable Turk army, Vlad desperately makes a dubious pact with a formidable caged vampire in order to acquire its dark powers and save his family & kingdom. Sarah Gadon plays Vlads winsome wife.

The producers flirted with the idea of Dracula Untold being part of Universals Dark Universe; and the epilogue of the movie, set in the modern world, suggests this, insinuating a franchise. This idea was dropped, however, and The Mummy (2017) became the first official film in the Dark Universe. In any case, Dracula Untold was fairly successful at the Box Office, making $56.3 million in North America and $217.1 million worldwide against a cost of $70 million.

My title blurb pretty much tells you all you need to know: Dracula Untold is basically the dark Superman of 15th century Eastern Europe where Dracula wields the power to defeat a thousand-man army. If you like the great prologue to Coppolas Bram Stokers Dracula (1992), youll probably like this movie, which gives several nods to that forerunner.

The film LOOKS awesome and has a fine cast. But unlike Bram Stokers Dracula, its rapidly paced and doesnt leave much room to breathe; so the characterizations aren't quite deep enough. Its good, but somehow hollow and forgettable. Bram Stokers Dracula was perhaps a little too slow while Dracula Untold is too hurried. I wish the creators found the happy medium between the two because, with just a little bit more time and attention to detail, it couldve been great.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot entirely in Northern Ireland. WRITERS: Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.

Haha I know, it sounds dumb to praise a vampire movie for its weighty emotional scenes, but I do think that the genre is a good place to explore ideas about death, sudden life changes, being estranged from loved ones, and of course immortality.

Granted, some of the dialogue is quite clunky. But overall the movie is a fun ride and it's not nearly as bad as the critics make it out to be.",1524614400,,648,4.586206896551724

An interesting way to blend the historical figure of Vlad III, the little impaler, Dracula, with the vampire story.  The acting is good, the production is pretty good as well with an interesting score by Ramin Djawadi as he began to get well-deserved recognition for ""Game of Thrones.""  Luke Evans holds it all together.  The ending, unexpectedly in a film about Dracula is hopeful...an interesting twist (it is also an ending that shamelessly begs for a sequel that is not likely to be made).",1516838400,,601,4.695238095238095

6500297,2,B00LSW76MO,"Im behind the times. So sue me.

Finally got around to Dracula Untold. Approached it without much enthusiasm, low expectations. 2nd tier Orlando Bloom did about as good a job as youd expect from the guy who looks like the guy who plays Legolas  he was OK. Charles Dance classes up any movie, so theres a high point.
The history is all wrong, wrong, wrong. Thats an annoyance. I thought the whole enterprise was weird, though. First, we want to have a vampire who isn't really evil. Story-telling wise, the moral conflicts added some much needed tension to the otherwise not-that-interesting story arc.
Heres the problem: our expectations have gotten really high. We aren't impressed with turning into smoke or moving kinda fast. Were not impressed with pretty fangs and frock coats. The movie turned Dracula into a superhero.
He can fly. He morphs into a cloud of bats that can fly faster than bats, and can also do other handy things  like turn into Gods Fist. In his first scene as a vampire confronting an army, he wipes out the whole army, by himself, in a few seconds.
Go back and watch the old Conan movies. Arnie was so huge, the directors had a hard time presenting him with and serious challenges. They had to resort to football players and basketball players to find people who existed on his scale. At the end of Destroyer, he fights a costumed Andre the Giant.
The Superman franchise jumped the shark a long time ago. In the 40s, he beat up mob bosses and jumped over cars. Now he throws continents into space and bullet bounce off his eyeballs.
Whatever.
No realistic threats. No limitations. Snooze.
The thing is, really the only threat to Dracula, once he meets the ex-machina Charles Dance Master Vampire in a cave, is the moral question: hell have to do some unpleasant things to protect his people. That could have been played much stronger. But it wasnt. In the end, his Turkish enemy inexplicably manages to sneak into the castle while Dracula is distracted fighting the army. Equally inexplicably, his mortal enemy seems to know what vampires are and that they don't like silver. These things are corrections to the godlike power given the title character which itself covers up for poor story telling with spectacle.
There is some spectacle. Almost-Orlando-Bloom is almost as pretty at Orlando Bloom; he looks pretty good in his armor. The special effects are OK, if you're into that kind of thing. But I just couldn't maintain serious interest in this film.",1515110400,,2480,4.7627906976744185

6500304,3,B00LSW76MO,Interesting origin story with some really great ideas and some really bad ones. Dracula's ability to destroy anything by turning into a bunch of bats was a bad idea. Vlad's 3 day test was a good idea. I think if they made it a hard R rating it would have done a character like this more justice than the friendly PG-13 cop out.

6500320,4,B00LSW76MO,"Apparently, Dracula was just a misunderstood prince among men.  He wasn't really bad, he had to be to save his people.  When an Ottoman scouting party is killed and drained in a cave near Vlads home, Vlad realizes hell get the blame, and sure enough, he does.  Sultan Mehmed II demands tribute and 1,000 boysplus Vlads son.  Whats a prince to do?  He makes a deal with a vampire and the rest is historyor hysteria.  Vlad literally goes batty.

Well, the scenery is lovely.  And Charles Dance as Master Vampire is incredible.  As for the retelling of a famous tale.  Some things should be left well enough alone.  This was very definitely meant to be part of a series repurposing the old horror icons.  So far, none of the entries in this proposed series has met with approval enough to incorporate any of them into a library of villains.  Universal Pictures Dark Universe recently pinned all their hopes on The Mummy remake instead.

As for this monster movie, its brief at a mere 93 minutes.  Its not particularly gory or scary.  Everything is artful and tastefully done.  I found it peculiar but fun.  They intend to remake it again at a later date.",1508716800,,1151,4.586206896551724

6500351,5,B00LSW76MO,"I first saw this movie with my sister Ruth; who has sinced past away; but Ruth could really relate to Dracula's wife wanting to be (Mother/Wife/Nuturer, Protector, Provider, Warrior Princess/Queen) to her family. Vlad Tepes is often seen as a hero in his Native Romania; yet the rest of the world outside of Romania does not see it that way; because most people would not do anything or whatever they have to do to protect their partner, family, children, and country; this takes a certain kind of inner strength and staying power that has long past the millenial generation. If you set aside the Science Fiction element of the movie and look strictly at a man willing to do anything to protect his family, country from the tyranny of the Ottoman Turkish Muslim Empire; then there lies the beauty and strength of Dracula/Vlad Tepes. They don't make men like that who would stop at nothing to protect his wife, child, and country. Every man should be Dracula to his family/country:  (Protector, Provider, Warrior). Luke Evans a man who also loves his family, LGBTQPAI Community,  and country very much catches the very essence of Dracula. Luke did an amazing job and so did the entire crew. I watch this movie every night; and I say this is what I want to be to my family and country (Mother/Nuturer, Protector, Provider, Warrior Princess). This inner strength, spirituality, love, honor, and staying power I have found in the real vampire community/energy workers community more so than any organize religion or faith. Dracula Untold is one of my favorite movies; I can relate to the pain of Dracula losing his wife; because I lost my sister Ruth Guzman on October 19, 2015. Ruth & I shared a love of this movie & watched Dracula Untold all the time; when we visited each other.

The trailer drew me in, the unrealistic B.S. drove me away. I mean it obviously appeals to some to add unrealistic demon like, monster like characters, but to me, no.

What I liked about it was it was a different take on Dracula. Most I've seen are either a retelling of the book or Dracula waking up in the 21st century and going on a bloodthirsty rampage. This actually tells about how Dracula was a person before a bloodsucker, the reason behind his transformation, the sacrifices he made. Luke Evans did an amazing job. He plays the character so well.

6500413,5,B00LSW76MO,"The similarity between this film and other tales about the mythical figure Dracula is close to non-existent; yet the tale told in this film is exciting, dramatic, and full of suspense, with a surprise ending.
In this version, the year is 1462. The Turks want to capture and hold the entire world. To augment their army, they insist that various kingdoms give them young boys that they can train to serve in their forces. They did so with the now king of Transylvania. He served the Sultan when his father, the then king, was forced to give him to the Sultan's army. Now, the Turks have demanded 1,001 young boys; the one being the king's son. The king's wife persuades him to refuse.
The king has no army to speak of and agrees with an unidentified man, later seen as a vampire, to become a vampire with all the powers of a vampire so that he can fight the Sultan's forces. He is told that if he drinks blood during the upcoming three days, he will remain a vampire forever. He is also told that if he does not drink blood during the three days, he will return to a normal human.
The question is: Can he defeat thousands of soldiers by himself in three days?",1491350400,,1158,4.3657407407407405

Nowadays you almost expect to hear someone say, somewhat disparagingly, ""Oh, yeah, that was done with Photoshop."" It takes a true artist's eye to put together images as intense as are seen, especially the battle scenes. Magnificent!

Caution: Spoiler: In the commentary, the gripe was made that the closing scene in the marketplace had to be filmed when it was mostly bright daylight. In Stoker's novel, Vlad is able to walk about in the sunlight; after all, Vlad is some 400-600 years old, and should have some immunity to sunlight. So, I see nothing to gripe about in having had to film in daylight. That goes right along with Stoker's plot all along. Why not?",1487462400,,766,4.674074074074074

Adds so much color to the Dracula story so it's not just blood and gore and terror (which I don't like) -- it's a compelling story that makes you root for Dracula as the good guy who did what he did to save his family and his people. I really like this movie and have watched it a few times. Not too scary, not too much vampire, but a lot of great action scenes and special effects (amazing fight scenes), and dramatic storytelling.

6500508,1,B00LSW76MO,"Vlad the Impaler as a family man is just a hard concept for me to swallow. I understand that you have to try to make Vlad a more likable character if he's going to be the star of your film, but they just make him so wholesome and sickeningly sweet, that it's hard to imagine him becoming the Prince of Darkness. (Which, spoiler warning, he really doesn't, because this film carries on the trend of making Dracula a romantic hero. Spare me.)

Personal preferences aside--I dream of the day where we once again have a Dracula that we can fear and loathe--the movie is just rushed. Aside from Vlad, Ingeras, Mirena, and Mehmed, I really couldn't tell you any of the other characters names. I assume that some characters are supposed to be important--the monk, the crotchety old man who is always seemingly trying to get rid of Ingeras, Vlad's many disposable friends, that creepy guy who follows Vlad around--but they're never given any character development. There's barely any time spent with any of the characters to make me really care what's happening to them or even really remember who they are. I've read some reviews that say that the movie moves as a fast pace, which it does, but it moves at such a pace that nothing really happens. It moves from one scene to the next without really setting anything up.

The ending makes it seem like they're setting up for the Avengers of Universal monsters, and God help us all of it actually happens.",1480118400,,1446,4.622568093385214

Most people don't usually think about music but the reality is that a powerful score can almost save a even a bad film. A great score can magically transform a mediocre movie into a good one. Again, not a bad movie... But if the investers would have ponied up the dough for a better composer, it could have been an epic film. Dont get me wrong, the composers score was functional and got the point across, but nothing more. The score was forgettable and generic.",1479859200,,603,4.298245614035087

6500547,5,B00LSW76MO,"This movie is a grand example of how one should not trust the reviews and half-assed critiques one will find regarding movies that are all too often  pushed aside for common sensationalist pap.  Take a chance, and trust in your own instincts regarding films, and you will find that many will suit you just fine, and may in fact, prove to be far better than you ever would have thought.  This, my friends, is one of the good ones.

For the fans of the classic legends of vampires, this movie shows that it is possible to bring a new spin to a venerable creature of the night.  Even the fans of the ""fluffier"" style of vampire might enjoy the romantic side of the titular character.  But, unlike modern vamps, who are written to avoid the difficulties of daylight, or blood, or silver, Vlad Tepes/Dracul brings us back to those roots and demonstrates how an old school vampire manages 'like a ""sir""'.

""Vlad Tepes (Luke Evans) is the Prince of Wallachia /Transylvania. Vlad and his men find a helmet that means an Ottoman scouting party is clearing the way for an invasion force. At Broken Tooth Mountain, Tepes finds a cave littered in bone fragments. Inside the dark depths they are savaged by a fiendishly strong man-like creature, whose speed, sharp teeth and keen red eyes, spell the death of all of Tepes' men, but not without cost.  The wounded creature attempts to make Tepes his victim, but halts when sunlight causes his blood to burn and turn to ash on the wind.  Vlad returns to his keep, and a monk informs him that a vampire, once a man who bargained with the devil for power, is accursed, and must remain in his rocky prison until he can pass his curse to another through a pact sealed with the vampire's own blood.

Time passes, and Tepes is with his wife and son when a Turkish entourage arrive and see audience.  Tepes offers them the customary tributes of silver coins, but the Sultan, named Mehmed, states that a contingent of Turkish men are missing, with the clear indication that Tepes was behind their disappearance.  He then demands an additional tribute of 1,000 boys to be trained as soldiers.  Tepes refuses the demand, but he knows his army is insufficient to repel the Turks if they should attack, so he asks Mehmed, who has known him since childhood, to show leniency and leave the children be.  Mehmed is not swayed by his request and Tepes then offers himself in their stead. The Sultan then demands that Tepes' own son must come also. The boy tells his father that he is ready to join the Sultan's army, but Tepes kills the Sultan's men knowing that his actions will lead to war.

Driven to desperation, Tepes revisits the cave seeking help from the vampire who tells him of the steep price of such a bargain.  He holds forth a skull bowl containing a large amount of blackish vampire blood, and informs him that if he is able to resist human blood for three days, the deal will be nullified and he will retain his humanity.  But, should he fail, he will inherit the blood curse of vampirism for all eternity and he will be required to render aid to the vampire when he finds his maker and seeks revenge upon him.  Knowing that he has no choice if he is to save his people and his family, Tepes agrees and drinks the creature's blood completely.  Immediately, he is wracked with pain, and through gritted teeth he asks:

""What happens now?""

The vampire turns away as he says:

""Now, you die.""

Drawing from history surrounding the actual Prince of Wallachia, the movie incorporates a heroic view of the main character, just as residents of that area hold now.  In this way, the story is a clever blend of romanticism, heroic sacrifice, infamous legend and historic events that is altogether entertaining and enjoyable.  It's dark, and moody and the characters are well played.  For those with teens and preteens, it's not all that bloody or gore-ridden, depending more on facial reactions and dizzying action to depict violence.  There is one sexual situation that is quite tame, and the movie doesn't rely on foul language or crudity to carry the story.  From beginning to end, it was a good vampire romp with great actors, great costumes, and dizzying quantities of bats.  How cool is that!?

If you are weary of vampires with the Star Trek: Next Gen. sinus-problem makeup to make them look ""scary"", or vampires that have had all the gritty, bitey fun stripped away, including the fangs, then join me in some classical throat-sucking warfare that you'll really enjoy.  The end of the film implies a sequel, which I do hope eventually gets made, and I for one, want more!  A lot more!  I've honestly had all the wimpy sparkly vamps I can handle for one lifetime.",1476576000,22,4696,4.612515042117931

It suffers from melodrama (but that goes hand-in-hand with many vampire films), things in the story that should have been fleshed out a bit better, random accents, and historical inaccuracies, but if you can handle that, it's worth a watch. The acting, effects, and scenery help make up for it.",1473206400,,376,4.8

I would add that Vlad never really spent much time in what is actually called ""Castle Bran"". The legend has been depicted in film and tv for 94 years now and ""Dracula Untold"" couldve stayed untold for another 94 yrs and moviegoers would be better off because of it.",1473206400,,622,4.7592592592592595

Spectacular special effects, some great actors, and the 'curse' will leave you on the edge of your seat, hoping and praying for the best but knowing it probably won't end well. The end of the movie was a surprise, and then, a clever twist that makes you hope and pray they'll make a sequel. Highly recommended for those who like vampire movies and/or action/horror/supernatural movies.

6500717,3,B00LSW76MO,"I loved Evans in The Hobbit series and I wanted to love this movie so much but it just did not seal the deal with me.

The plot was a nice take on the Dracula legend and Evans came across fairly well as a Prince who had to do horrifying things to protect his people but if you did not know the story of ""The Impaler"" and the history of the times it could have gotten pretty confusing.  I absolutely detest political correctness and they went all the way changing Islam into ""The Turks"" as the enemy which was mostly true but when they talked about marching to Vienna (Battle of Vienna, 1683 - a great story in itself) again, unless you knew the history before hand, it made no sense.  How many people know the geographical and political relationship between Transylvania and its surrounding areas, the city of Vienna (Austria) and the Ottoman Empire, i.e. ""The Turks"" referenced in the movie?

The special effects added almost nothing to the movie and the ending made absolutely no sense other than that it repeated a deal that really made no sense earlier in the movie.

Oh well, I own it and maybe late some night I might watch it again but it will be likely quite a bit into the future.  This movie is not going to be like ""Silence of the Lambs"" which I have probably watched 20 times or the ridiculous number of times I have watched The Hobbit series and the Lord of the Ring series or the Director's cut of Bladerunner.

Rewrite the script a bit, get rid of some of the special effects and take a hard look at some of the back up casting and try it again.  This could have been a good movie.",1464825600,,1596,4.296666666666667
6500718,5,B00LSW76MO,"Great movie, enjoyed the new viewpoint",1464739200,,38,5.5
6500719,4,B00LSW76MO,"Another vampire movie it is not ! This movie looks into the origins of Dracula, which is a cool twist. The special effects are great , and acting is good. I found it to be totally entertaining.  Enjoy!",1464739200,,201,4.2894736842105265
6500720,4,B00LSW76MO,"If you have read any of my other reviews you know that I am extremely critical of Hollywood for not having the courage to use Islam anytime the plot requires a foreign enemy, even when it is entirely justified in doing so.

Tom Clancys  The Sum of all fears, for example.  Instead of using the novels Muslim terrorists as the bad guy, a gutless Hollywood  shifted the enemy to some fringe criminal Russian gang. Making absolutely no sense to why a drug smuggling, gun running, criminal enterprise with no political motivations would want to kill thousands of Americans to make a statement.

Or, the 2013 Olympus has Fallen, an otherwise earnest suspense ridden attempt if they hadnt laughably used North Koreans instead of a much more believable Muslim terror group as the culprit in this film. How is North Korea going to mount an attack like that without some overwhelming presence here in the United States? Answer, they wont, but Muslims have desire, the hatred and the possible underground community to attempt something like that. And, some of those Muslims live here  right alongside of us. They are our neighbors, they work in our industries, and send their children to our schools.

But, of course, Hollywood political correctness would never assume to criticize Islam in that way. Russians and North Koreans, but not the Muslims, the only group to have seriously threaten the west in the last 25-30 years.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that isn't the case with the manufactured vampire movie, Dracula Untold, an Irish production starring Luke Evens in the title role with Gary Shore directing. Released in 2014 it can be seen now on Netflix.

The movie builds the prequel to Bram Stokers 19th century Dracula character, using Islam as a bad guy. Historically there was some interaction, sometimes violently between the peoples of that part of Eastern Europe and the rising spread of the new Ottoman empire, So, it had some historical precedence. As far as I know so far the Muslims have remained silent on this movies premise.

Years ago the film 300 was severely criticized by the Iranians for using Persian history as a nemesis even though this was before the onslaught of Islam. Their arguments fell largely onto deaf ears because this is the history of that particular event. The mighty Persian army was held off by 300 Spartan soldiers at Thermopylae almost 2500 years ago changing the course of history by saving Western Civilization at that time.

The laughable reaction the Iranians got from the rest of the world could be the reason the Turks, the historical descendants of the Ottomans,  are remaining silent, a little surprising especially since they are ruled by a big mouth dictator who is turning his country into the Islamic version of the Third Reich.  And, maybe the protectors of Islam in the west, i.e., CAIR thought better of it since there is some historical context for this movie also, and they took such a PR bashing on 300.

The fact is that the director and writers of this film could have gone the way of productions like The Sum of all Fears, or Olympus has Fallen and used any bad guy for the antagonist, any made up warlord trying to expand his realm since the story is obscure anyway,  but they didnt, they used the rise of Ottoman Islam, an accurate accounting of the history of that time and place, using creative license to explain the beginnings of Stoker's Dracula.

The cowardice of Hollywood that hides behind political correctness could learn a thing or two from this production effort. Islam and Christianity have been opposed to each other since Mohammad invented his religion 1400 years ago. The clash between them flared up from time to time and we should be cognizant of that history. Dracula Untold pays that history well.

When the Sultan demands 1000 boys from Vlad the Impalers kingdom including Vlads own son for his Janissary companies, Vlad was powerless to stop him. The Ottomans at the time were on the rise and were sucking up Christian kingdoms moving every closer from Eastern to Western Europe.
Janissaries were foreign soldiers used by the Turks to fight in their front lines so fewer actual Turkish soldiers would fall in battle.  The mentality was not unlike the Jihadists today who use women and children to fall in front of them so they can use it, to save as many of their soldiers as possible, to say nothing of propaganda value. Accusing Israel, the United States and other western soldiers of killing without regard to the innocent has gone a long way in international public opinion. Earlier incarnations of this method to save the empires soldiers, the 15th century Ottomans at least put weapons and trained the soldiers to fight, even if they were kept as slaves.

Vlad meets with the Sultan, tries to convince him otherwise, but the Turkish ruler explains that he needs this for his Vienna campaign. Historians of the era will take notice that Vienna didn't happen for at least 200 years later than this timeline. Historical mistakes notwithstanding Vlad is left with no choice because his much weaker forces will be defeated.

It is here where he makes his pact with a monstrous cave dwelling blood sucking entity to become the vampire that folklore history has traced to him. Going through this transformation he goes out to the battlefield and defeats this forward advance of the Muslims single handedly. He then turns most of his guards and some of their women into vampires and they defeat the entire Sultans army. The Muslims never had a chance against this western advanced literary folklore, an irony I am sure is lost on the backward, unimaginative Islamic world.

It was good to see a Muslim enemy defeated so thoroughly on the battlefield even if it was a 15th century fabricated tale. We should not be intimidated by Islamic juvenile whining, being insulted by the slightest fairy tale. Draw cartoons, make movies, tell stories that show the despicable part of their history. If our artistic community does not reflect the world around us then it will eventually lose its influence in that very same world. Wake up Hollywood, take a cue from Dracula Untold.",1464652800,,6155,4.8428571428571425

6500789,5,B00LSW76MO,"I love the different aspect on the story of Dracula. Similar to movies such as Troy, it turns a classic into something far more epic, and almost believable. I have never seen a retelling of Dracula that incorporates so much of the actual history blended with the legend to create a very human character that the audience can actually identify with. And the ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel...fingers crossed.",1459209600,,422,4.875

6500797,5,B00LSW76MO,"A lot of you bloodsuckers out there will love this review but you probably won't like me very much. You see, I know werewolves exist, I have seen one. Then again I am part Native American and part German. Scary enough huh? But for mummies, vampires (except for bats), space aliens and other creatures I have not seen, it is hard to believe in them. I never read the original Dracula by Bram Stoker, it seems none of you vampires actually have either. I can tell you this much, in my wildest imagination, I can tell you that kissing a vampire would be like kissing an ashtray, cold because the dead are ashes and none of them shimmer, sorry Twilight, you are not a believable writer, but I am happy you made a fortune off your slosh love story. Luckily you had Taylor Lautner to save your movie. I must say that your two leads look like vampires out of makeup, so you saved a lot of money there, my hats off to you.

Knowing Hollywood like I do, I suspect that all Dracula movies miss the point Bram Stoker tried to make. Although some of them are good, most should have ended up on the cutting room floor. Needless to say I am not a vampire movie fan and I have seen way too many. Then along comes Dracula Untold. I thought Oh my gosh not another one! I watched the trailer. Dang that looks good.

If I had to do a review of a Dracula movie, I had to like this. . . but why? First the love of a father for his wife and son. I had to put myself in Vlads place and wonder what I would do. Second of all I am not a warrior, but in this case, I sure would try.  This alone had more grit than any other vampire movie I have seen. It made sense and was not about random actions. Third reason, is that the movie actually was written well. Dead is dead, and they did not miss the mark on that one. Add great directing, excellent photography, fantastic actors, a good story, and you have an almost perfect movie.

Many reviewers did not like this movie, because they too got away from the basics of the Dracula Story. I think most of them were women and fell into the Twilight hype. However if you want a basic idea of Dracula, then you will want to see this. Based on all other Vampire movies I have seen, I rate this 5 out of 5 stars!

6500821,5,B00LSW76MO,"One of the best movies in years. The vid is shot from behind the eyes of Vlad the Impaller. Great effects, very intensely violent. This is not like some, teen-horn-dog, immortality fixation movie. There is no ""sparkely"" Vampires is this tale. This is not a gushy romance ""I have crossed oceans of time looking for you""...pant pant type movie either. No. This movie mostely sticks with the TRUTH. THE REAL Vladimir Tepes. The legendary atrocities that Vlad committed had a purpose: In order to protect his people and loved ones he had to become something else...something much more horrible. NO, In the beginning, Vlad had to win by instilling terror into the hearts of those who dare oppose him. But even the worst he could do was just not enough. There was only one way to beat the massive Turk army building up its army to attack and slaughter everyone...Vladimir makes an unholy deal with a demon. That's all. Don't want to spoil it for anybody. Trust me, this movie is worth the money to read, or BUY like I did.

6500918,2,B00LSW76MO,"This movie is an attempt to tell a compelling origin of the most famous of all vampires, spinning a tale of woe and sorrow and the torment of a man who willingly became a monster to save his family and people yet loses everything.

And it fails.

Oh you can clearly see how Vlad Tepes is supposed to be a good man loved by his family and admired by the people he is ruled over, and can understand why when he is put in a seemingly impossible situation he turns to the power of monsters to help him through it. But for me the problem is that the plot feels half-baked. As if the script had a defined beginning and end, but wasn't quite sure how the middle should work.

He doesn't want his son to be a soldier in the Turks army so he kills the men sent to retrieve the boy, starting a way with the most powerful military force in the world. He doesn't have the manpower to fight the war so he goes to a trapped vampire he conveniently found several days before, who in exchange for his freedom offers to turn Vlad into a vampire and if he can keep from feeding on blood for three days he will turn back into a human. He spends most of those three days evacuating his people until he finally confronts the Turk army, driving them away but losing his family and people to plot convenience which trumps his vampire powers.

This could have been a good movie, but as it stands I don't think it is.",1449878400,2,1392,4.163568773234201

6500936,4,B00LSW76MO,"Dracula Untold in my viewpoint told a story of how far a man would go to protect the people he cares for and about.  The movie itself was very intense in mutiple scenes inculde the fight scenes at times very brutal images, so I would advise not letting any children see this movie.  The acting job of Mr Luke Evans was very good and I enjoy the whole movie and time went by fast for a 90 minute movie, the other actors did a very good job as well and made you feel threwout the movie happy, gross out, sad so forth in different scenes.  But as for myself I thought the movie was better then everyone lead me to believe, that's why I gave it a four star rating here on Amazon.  If your looking for a good movie with good actors and a different spin on the story of Dracula then buy this movie and enjoy it as much as I did but beware there is some brutal fight scenes and aftermath of what happened on the fields.",1448668800,,912,4.05

6500960,5,B00LSW76MO,"I normally don't do film reviews, but I wanted to for this one because, when I saw the previews a while back, it didn't appeal to me at all.  I've seen too many bad vampire movies.  I have to say with this one however, the casting was on point, the story felt unique and original, the scenery was just awesome, the special effects weren't overdone, and it leaves you hoping for a solid follow up film.  There probably won't be, but this one satisfies, I just finished it and will be ready to watch it again soon.  Not that it's similar too, but others movies I'd rank it with for personal taste and to see again are Star Trek: Into Darkness, Live, Die, Repeat, John Carter and 300 to name a few; if you like those, than you will most likely enjoy this.

There were little things I would change, some were addressed in the bonus features but didn't come out as emotional in the film like the rivalry between Vlad and the Sultan, a glimpse into their relationships as kids would have been great; there were many night scenes which sounded awesome, gave the film a punch, but were dark and a little hard to see all of the great stunts; I was hoping to see him in wolf form, would have been the best; and the wings on the cover look friggin' cool but don't appear in the film; the creature in the cave's story could have been expanded on too, with him fighting alongside him or tempting him more, but overall, I would still stick to the 5 stars.

6500982,5,B00LSW76MO,"Loved this movie. Very good plot. Growing up i read most of the Bram Stoker's Dracula. So i have always loved the story. Even though the movie does connect with novel in any way.
I like how they portray vampires...like how they have always been originally depicted. As primarily evil and dangerous. At one point a quote is said in the movie. When talking about a vampire. Calling the vampire the 'son of the devil'. The Twilight series took a different take on vampires. And in my opinion romanticizing the notion.
The way the vampires are depicted in this film is a raw power. You fall in love with Vlad, though you recognize the evil within him. There is nothing cute or romantic about it all.
I hope you enjoy this movie as much as i did. :)",1445817600,,744,4.398550724637682

Dracula is about fear and death and the fact that all beautiful and human things must wither away because that is our nature. It's about sensuality and sexuality  which is our only real ticket to immortality. It's about touching what we should not, having what we cannot, and taking what we most want (but would never admit).

Dracula is one of my favorite novels. This movie was pretty terrible.

6501101,4,B00LSW76MO,"There few literary characters, Shelley's Frankenstein, Borough's Tarzan, Fleming's James Bond, and maybe Rowling's Harry Potter, who have morphed through the generations into superstar brands as has Stoker's Dracula. And, each generation, it seems, adds its own twist to ""the prince of darkness"". As a pre teen in the 1970s, I saw all the Hammer Films' horror flicks (Lagosi-Lee-Langela gave us some of the most chilly-and thrilling-Draculas of all time!). Today's ""Dracula Untold"", as the latest installment of the Dracula brand, does not disappoint. This prequel presents the father of all vampires as a noble, almost fairytale, hero who sacrifices self for the good of his community (yes, it's revisionist socialism; Stoker never envisioned this for his evil antagonist), a sort of remake of Kipling's Gugna Din. That said, the screenplay is plausible, the acting is agreeable, and the special effects are remarkable. Although this movie may not be for date night (lots of blood and gore), it is certainly suggested (little profanity and no nudity) for the Dracula aficionado and student of vampires. The interesting ending suggests a potential sequel, now wouldn't that be unusual- another Dracula flick!",1440633600,,1208,5.396825396825397
6501102,5,B00LSW76MO,"This is probably not a horror movie for horror movie lovers. Not enough mind-searing images of terror and depravity. But if you want to see a well-acted and quite touching movie about a man who loves his family and his country and gives his very soul to try to save them, you won't be disappointed. Luke Evans is fabulous in the lead role, and all the actors do a fine job around him. I wasn't expecting much when I saw this, but I was very touched and entertained. If you're on the fence about watching, give it a try. The PG-13 rating probably turns off the hard-core vampire-movie fan, but it's what made me give this a try.

6501147,5,B00LSW76MO,I love this movie with Luke Evans. I had seen him in Fast and Furious and enjoyed how he played his character very much. Once I watch a movie and like an actor or actress I usually go find other movies that person was in and Dracula Untold was the next movie of his I watched. He made this an excellent movie. The story line was close to some of the stories that had been told about Dracula in the past but a different twist on any Dracula movies that I had seen before which made this one an excellent choice for my collection.,1439078400,,528,4.086538461538462

6501185,1,B00LSW76MO,"Beginning in the 15th century with everyones favorite historical Impaler, Prince Vlad (a true-life Wallachian hero), screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless imagine, ala Maleficent, an origin of a bold and noble member of royalty who turns to evil to protect his realm from the Turkish empire which seeks to enslave his people.
Desperate for help on the eve of an invasion, Vlad makes an impossible climb to the top of a spooky mountain to face the legendary beast withina demonic creature who is clearly the master vampire. So why don't we get his origin story? Turns out Dracula is just another tragic dude in a long line of tragic dudes. We equate Dracula the character as being vampire Numero Uno, so right off the bat (pun intended), were left wanting the origin of vampires altogether, not just this one. The creature (played with usual sneering evil by a slumming Charles Dance, the only one in the film who looks like they're having any fun) gives the brave Vlad the option of drinking his blood to gain his powers, but if he gives in to feeding on anyones blood in 3 days time, he becomes cursed forever. Why 3 days? Why not a week? Why not 43  hours?

Historical names are borrowed to seemingly root the story in reality, but dates and locales are way off here(Vlad was a Wallachian, not Transylvanian, prince). So much for historical value. There is definitely entertainment value to be had viewing Dracula Untold, though it is not intentional. Battle scenes where Vlad turns into a horde of millions of bats (where did these bats come from?) and mows down an army of thousands offered plenty of chuckles. Vlads former brother and now enemy, Ottoman sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) somehow has all the scoop on the latest vampire extermination trends, so he keeps plenty of silver around and knows that a stake in the heart and exposure to the sun could kill him. Even freshly new to his powers, Dracula has harnessed the ability to turn others into rampaging bloodsuckers and is also given Thors nifty powers of control over the weather, which comes in handy to block out that pesky sun. A particularly hilarious moment is when his wife is falling from the high tower of a mission (monks cannot be bothered to construct guard rails); Vlad jumps after her, and we go down in slo-mo, with a mournful exotic voice wailing in the background to underscore the emotion.

As Vlad, Luke Evans (last seen as Bard in The Hobbit movies) is full of brooding fury; we get the motivation for turning to dark powers, but he doesnt have the support of any believable transition. Everyone else plays stock characters. The cinematography is dark and muddled, like you're viewing the movie through a dirty window pane.

In trying to reboot Universals classic monsters legacy with an origin of the master vampire himself, the filmmakers completely lost sight of the idea that he kind of has to be scary. Vampires are so ubiquitous these days (thanks Twilight) in teen romance movies, campy sexy HBO series (True Blood), and philosophical, angst-ridden studies (Jim Jarmuschs Only Lovers Left Alive), that an entire generation has grown up on vampires that are everything but scary. This is not a way to reboot a monster movie. It would actually have been most refreshing to see him back in the shadows, emerging with hypnotic brows.

CLICHES: Throw a dart at any frame. SURPRISES: they do throw in a mysterious Renfield like characterseems theres always someone eager to serve a dark lord. YOU ALSO LIKE: for a scarier vampire tale, check out Showtimes original series, Penny Dreadful, a wonderfully eerie mashup of Victorian gothic monsters including the search for Dracula (avail on amazon). Let the Right One In (or its AMerican remake, Let Me In) is the best vampire film made in the last 10 years.",1437609600,3,3801,4.796946564885496

6501190,4,B00LSW76MO,"This movie looked lackluster from the previews, but the positive reviews persuaded me into a rental. Where I thought I might be getting a dull, boring Hollywood movie like so many others, something to be watched and forgotten (Underworld sequels for example), I actually found myself engaged with the narrative of this film. It was quite a bit of fun, well acted, and well paced. I didn't find myself bored which I assumed I would.

Dracula is portrayed as a sympathetic hero, a man made into a monster to save his family and kingdom from the overwhelming forces of the Turkish invaders, and at the time I viewed this movie I thought this might be a bit too Hollywood, but having since read some books on Vlad the Impaler (he was a real monster no doubt) there is a revered awe about his legend held by the people of the region. He is remembered in legends as a tragic hero, and this film captures that well. In fact, the filmmakers did their homework and made some nods to historical accounts. Though let's be honest, this is not an historically accurate film, and the filmmakers don't really try to pretend it is. If the choice is between historical fact and heroic character building, well let me assure you they always choose the latter.

Visually the film is interesting, Dracula's character arc is easy to get invested with, and his family does not feel annoying like I feared they would. I'd say check it out if you were hesitant and you love Dracula mythos, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised. This is no incoherent mess of Hugh Jackman Van Helsing slinging machine gun powered silver arrows at vampire harpies, nor is it a snoozing bore-fest of King Arthur with Clive Owen which in all its ""true story""-ness became so unlike the classic tale it was not worth the price of admission, and so creatively bankrupt it was not worth watching.

Though at some points you may wonder how becoming a vampire equals controlling such unequaled power. It had a tinge of video game quality towards the end. I was reminded of Lords of Shadow. Which I won't complain about.",1437523200,8,2071,4.6530054644808745

6501288,4,B00LSW76MO,"The year is 1492 Transylvania - The small Kingdom ruled by 'Prince Vlad' (The Impaler)(Luke Evans) has enjoyed peace for the
past ten years.
When during a Celebration the Kings envoy turn up to claim the fealty due, they also demand 1000 boys to serve with his armies'
the selection would also include 'Prince Vlad' and 'Mirena's' (Sarah Gadon) young Son, however 'Vlad' is not prepared to meet the
demands of 'King Mehmed' (Dominic Cooper) knowing the warlord will wreak vengeance upon his small kingdom.
Earlier 'Vlad' had lost two of his men in a mysterious cave on the side of a mountain that harbours pure evil, it is to this cave the
Prince turns too, to save both his family and his people, the cost to himself, eternal damnation, he will become something very
different with unimaginable power and senses, which have been passed to him by 'The Master' (Charles Dance)
The passion for his family and his people remains, he returns to his castle which is under siege from overwhelming forces - odds he
will not fear.
'Vlad' seeks to take his family and people to a safe place knowing the War-Lord King will hunt them down, as the days pass his need
for blood becomes intense....
The story to be told well needed more than the approx 90 minute run-time, the story perhaps a little fanciful stretching the story and
legend in the telling of the beginnings of Dracula, however if watched with little expectation, as a spectacle putting aside legend it's
a decent special-effects viewing.
As an earlier reviewer pointed out the role taken by Charles Dance somewhat beneath his acting prowess in truth.

6501313,4,B00LSW76MO,"Luke Evans has presence, there is no denying it. He was dramatic, anguished, determined, and photogenic. He carried scenes all by himself. The weakest element of the tale was the romantic connection, it certainly didn't gel for me, though both Vlad and Mirena were lovely to watch. I think Mirena as played was too immature, not at all queenly. Another problem I had was there was no connection really to any of the other characters. No time taken to demonstrate the ties, it was like being dropped into the middle of a story without preparation. Brother Lucian, had a bit of chemistry with Vlad, if only the time had been taken to flesh it out. I wanted more, what had happened to bring them together as friends or persons with a shared interest? And Dumitru, he too could have been the brother in arms that gave the film depth beyond Vlad alone. In the few scenes they had together it was tantalizingly out of reach. Really I have to say, the film was rushed and a bit jumpy, yes. But time and again Evans (Vlad) caught my eye. Special effects, the flight of the bats, that was especially good.",1434499200,,1096,4.5125628140703515

Nor could they control a literal tsunami of (again, CGI) bats to battle the enemy hordes. And they most definitely can't be RE-transformed back into a human by passing along their vampirism to someone else. They should have called this turkey Lord of the Wings. After the first couple of massive fights between the CGI bat hordes and the evil Turks, I was yearning for a real Dracula movie. With the exception of a brief appearance by the Charles Dance, this flick is just another lame CGI-fest with virtually none of the elements of a memorable Dracula movie.",1433808000,8,781,4.835820895522388

Vlad the Impaler, his story is tweaked and told in a diffenert way that is...to me a better way of telling the history of such a wicked and Gruesome Dude! Sure glad I was not form that era.
There is Love. There is Honor. There is Family and a bond so strong it can not be broken at all...all the way to the end!
Speaking of the end I did not really care for the ending. Yes it leaves it open for another Dracula...But to me this story does not need a #2. Because it would truly ruin this one!

6501464,4,B00LSW76MO,"So I'm starting to sense a pattern in all my movie reviews...not sure why it took me so long, however i tend to write reviews based on rental viewing from the comfort of your own home. The movie experience, imo, changes the review completely if you have to drive to theater, battle parking, crowds, pay an insane amount of money for sustenance, fight for the 'perfect' viewing seat, only to be disappointed by a mediocre movie. Viewing from your home however, a mediocre movie suddenly isn't so bad. I have to say though, that if i did view this in the theater, i would not have been too disappointed, especially if it was a half price matinee. Pleasantly surprised on this one. While i was not blown away, this Dracula made for a pretty entertaining experience. First lets talk Luke Evans, where have you been hiding?? In  Hobbit garb, I'm sure, that's why I'm suddenly all sympathetic to Dracula. He did what he did out of love, what's a cup of blood or two?? That would be me. Great casting and cinematography. The only character that threw me was his little wanna be side kick. If anyone has watched Black Sails, Captain Vane makes an appearance as this mealy Gollum like character that just seemed all wrong. Looks wise, okay. When he spoke, it was just strange and weird and just seemed all wrong. The story was surely told from a different, albeit interesting angle which i think audience will like from the normal departure of Dracula, it kind of gives him a soul and i must say, i like this Dracula best. Near the end, I'm suddenly thinking that so many things about vampires make sense, as if trying to rationalize the phenomenon in modern day. That's a good movie, that makes fantasy perfectly normal. There was a bit of forethought with this story. The balance of the cast was not as strong but not terrible, but i honestly did not expect more. This was a strong B movie thinly disguised as an A ( think Hercules which, this was better, imo). The effects I'm sure would have been outstanding on the big screen, or just a giant TV. I'm fairly certain than anyone going into this with low expectations, i mean, it is Dracula, will be pleased with the outcome. It was the least cheesy, verging on non cheesy, of any Dracula movie or TV show in a very long time. I really do hope that there's a sequel, however making a modern day sequel may loose a bit of the drama and intrigue than keeping to the previous historical setting. I do recommend this for a night in with friends, it was dark with a good amount of action, drama, intrigue to make it a worthwhile Saturday night.",1432339200,2,2583,4.484076433121019

6501529,3,B00LSW76MO,"Gary Shore's ""origin"" story of Dracula isn't the first to film and certainly won't be the last.  Nothing wrong with that of course, so how does it play out here.  Frankly, the first part of the film is interesting and entertaining.  Prince Vlad (Luke Evans) of Transylvania was trained as a boy to be a soldier for the Turks who controlled much of the world in the mid-15th century.  He got quite a reputation as a relentless killer of his enemies, even staking them with long wooden poles.  Known as Vlad the Impaler, he is able to return to his throne.  Protected by the Turks, he has no army but rules the land peacefully with his wife, Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and son Ingeras (Art Parkinson) by his side.

When Vlad's childhood friend Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) becomes Sultan, he resurrects the old ""drafting"" of boys who will supplement the Turk's standing army.  Vlad of course objects to the demand of 1000 boys.  But with no army what is he to do.  Well, earlier in the story he and 2 of his lieutenants stumble upon a cave high in the mountains where they encounter a horrible demon credited as the ""Master Vampire"" (Charles Dance).  Vlad's life is spared.  He decides to go back and make a deal in order to gain the power needed to fight off Mehmed's troops.  The logic here is somewhat suspect.  I know Vlad is desperate but why would he think Master Vampire would accommodate him?  Well, wouldn't you know it, he does.

Vlad drinks a portion of Master Vamp's blood using a nearby cap of a human skull.  No neck biting here.  Master Vamp promises Vlad ""the power of 100 men, the speed of a falling star"" and perhaps the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound.  In any case, if Vlad wants to return to his mortal self, he must abstain from drinking blood for 3 days.  And yes, stay out of sunlight and away from Kryptonite...I mean silver.  If he succumbs to the blood drinking, bam, he's a vampire forever and Master Vamp can leave his cave.

This mid-point in the movie is really where things fall apart.  Vlad's main method of transport is to transform into a bevy of bats and fly at supersonic speed.  So into the heart of battle he goes.  And manages to slaughter (without any blood on screen) 1000 of the Sultan's best soldiers.  Wait, no one said he had the power of 1000 men, it was 100.  With a storyline that suggests that this was the first of a series, Shore and his writers seemed to rush things, leaving huge plot holes, ridiculous actions and an overload of unnecessary CGI carnage.

Ultimately, the film which has some interesting actors and started out well, ends with a thud.  Rarely do I think a film has too short a running time, but this film ends with a bunch of poorly edited scenes.

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Black levels are inky and certainly necessary in that much of the film is shown with dark night sequences.  Still color levels are good along with hues and saturation levels.  Excellent detail as well as noted in the elaborate body armor Vlad and Mehmed wear.  There is plenty of action in the film which serves the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  Bats are flying everywhere and they surround the viewer if you have a surround set up.  An excellent musical score helps set the tone of the film.  The LFE channel gets a workout as well, especially in the battle scenes and the one where Vlad and his allies approach the final battle in an electrical storm.  At times, it seemed the surrounds overwhelmed the dialog but was easily adjusted.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Here are the extras:

It's a clear deviation from Bram Stoker's Dracula, and that both bugged and intrigued me before watching.  but I actually did enjoy it.

I forgive the plot holes because, after all, it is a vampire movie, much like I forgave the many plot holes of dawn of the dead because it was a zombie movie.

I rated it at 4 stars only because I didn't like the way some of the scenes were filmed as reflections in a sword or out of focus. Fancy camera work doesn't make up for good special effects.

It isn't a masterpiece and it won't be the sort of movie that will be cherished decades from now as a great piece of movie history (unless the events of Idiocracy come to pass)...but it was a solid bit of filmmaking. Had different actors been cast in a couple of the roles it would have been the sort of movie worth little more than a laugh and some well-deserved derision. The special effects weren't bad either, though I have seen better.
I don't recommend rushing out to pick up a copy or anything, but if you get the chance, it is worth taking the time to sit through it and enjoy it for what it is...a monster movie made in the tradition of the old Universal monster movies, and as such it was a suitable homage.",1429315200,,988,4.464088397790055

It was OK, unfortunately it picks up after Vlad the Impaler fought his war that gave him his nickname. Probably would have been a far better action movie if they included that. Charles Dance(Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones) was great in a limited role. OK for a rent if there's nothing else you want to see.",1428624000,,572,4.305555555555555

6501826,3,B00LSW76MO,"Luke Evans did a fantastic job with his role. That being said, the film's script was not very well written, featured a lot of flat characters, and the plot essentially turned inside out on itself when his motive changed halfway through the film. The saving grace of this movie was definitely the impressive effects and the rather unexpected but interesting ending as well as Mr. Evans acting. Worth a watch but wouldn't count it among my favorites.",1428278400,,448,4.8311688311688314

6501833,5,B00LSW76MO,"Since Dracula the TV Series was cancelled after one season, I was looking forward to this movie.  It didn't disappoint, which is why I was so surprised at the mixed to negative reviews for it.  23% on Rotten Tomatoes.  40% on Metacritic.  6/10 on IMDB.  I thought it was certainly better than mediocre, and it actually follows real history more so than almost all ""Dracula""-based movies and TV shows I've seen.  I'm a huge fan of history, so that's a plus in my book.

So, if you like Dracula-inspired media and are a fan of history, I believe you'll enjoy this as I did.  If you hate history or dislike movies that get into the finer details, you may want to skip it.",1428278400,2,668,4.373983739837398

6501840,2,B00LSW76MO,"I saw the preview, for this movie, while in the theater waiting to see the movie Lucy. I hated Lucy by the way. The overall look, of this film, was something that instantly attracted me not to mention its leading man. After the movies release I didn't hear a peep about it and that's never a good sign. When the opportunity came to watch it from the comfort of my own home I was hesitant and didn't want to be disappointed. As it turned out I wasn't disappointed because I didn't have high hopes in the first place.

I paid to watch this movie and no matter how good I wanted it to be it was more like a chic flick than anything. The lead character proclaims to have a reputation of legitimately being ""Vlad the Impaler"" but very little about the character lived up to this reputation.  Half way through the movie there's a small scene with blindfolds and at this point I wanted to change the channel and demand my money back. I wanted to like it.

The movie was well acted, good casting, good special affect, and the story line that leaves you at the end, makes you want an answer to for a sequel.

This is supposed to be a new twist on the old Dracula story but we've seen this story before. It's the same old mellow-dramatic plot of 'Spawn' or 'Batman' or any other comic book antihero' that has been done to death. This is the same treatment that was recently given to 'Malificent'. Take a classic villain and make them into a misunderstood martyr. Evil is ok. Selling your soul to satan is ok if you do it for the 'right' reason.  And of course don't forget that Christianity is the 'real' evil and all Christians are spineless hypocrites. I think we're getting the message Hollywood.,1427846400,5,681,4.771186440677966

6501931,4,B00LSW76MO,"An excellent action/fantasy that combines history with legend. Vlad III, prince of Wallachia (Luke Evans), who eventually becomes ""Dracula, son of the Devil"", is based upon Vlad the Impaler, a 15th century leader of Romania capable of incredible cruelty, who would impale his victims.

As Vlad III rules in peace at the beginning of the movie, Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) asks Vlad for a thousand of his boys, eventually including even his son Ingeras (Art Parkinson), to serve the Ottoman Empire, instead of just the usual tribute. Vlad goes to Broke Tooth Mountain to seek the strength of the Master Vampire (Charles Dance) in order to resist the Turks. As the suspicious Vampire has his hand on Vlad's throat, Vlad says, ""Sometimes the world no longer needs a hero. Sometimes what it needs ... is a monster."" This makes me think of something I once heard a priest say on a television show: ""At a time when the world had stopped believing in the Devil, Hitler came into the world and showed it the face of the Devil."" - Father George William Rutler

Back to the movie, where if Vlad drinks some of the Vampire's blood, he will gain the Vampire's strengths to take on the Turks. But if he subsequently drinks someone's blood before the third day, he will become a Vampire. If he doesn't, he will resurrect, so to speak, to his former self. Vlad drinks, making a pact, a deal with the son of the Devil, so to speak. With the Vampire's strength, Vlad has the ability to take on ""a thousand"" man army by himself. (Someone younger needs to be able to do that, Sly, Arnold, Bruce, and Liam are getting up there.) 3 and 1000 are important numbers in the Bible. Christ rose on the third day and His servants will reign with Him for a thousand years (Revelation 20:4; 7:4-8).

As the soldiers of the Ottoman Empire are coming for Vlad, a group of his subjects are on their knees in prayer to which Vlad responds: ""The Turks are coming. Prayers will not defend these walls. Get these men off their knees."" Why not have the women, children, and men who can't fight continue their prayers  while Vlad and his soldiers prepare to fight (and they should be praying too)? The Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary on the Catholic Church calendar commemorates how the Christians turned back the Muslims at Lepanto to save Europe while the Pope prayed the Rosary.

But Vlad subsequently makes his own prayer in a church: ""Lord, if you've not yet forsaken me, grant me your strength that I may resist the darkness. Allow me to endure this test one more day. ... I beg you. ... Please.""

This made me think of some Scriptures: ""Then he told them a parable about the need for them to pray always without losing heart ... 'Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. ... Sufficient for a day is its own evil. ... My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.'"" - Luke 18:1; Matthew 26:41; 6:34; 2 Cor 12:9

The acting in ""Dracula Untold"" was excellent. Luke Evans definitely has a strong presence. The movie is definitely a strong PG-13, meaning the bloodletting, war scenes, and a bit of sensuality are inappropriate for pre-teens and the squeamish. I'll end with a quote I recently came across that seems to fit here:

""The difference between the City of God and the City of Man is like the difference between Jesus Christ and Dracula. Jesus Christ shed his blood so that you can have eternal life. Dracula sheds your blood so that he can have eternal life."" - E. Michael Jones

This was a great version of the Dracula story, one that combines some of my favorite aspects into a smooth storyline. And it was brought together beautifully by Luke Evans' skills. On top of amazing acting skills, the CGI and action sequences were very well done and kept the movie going extremely well and quickly. It never felt like a long, drawn out film.

Dracula Untold kept me watching through the entire film. There was nothing boring about it.
On thing is for sure. I've never thought of Dracula in this way, but in this, he kind of is a medieval super hero. It was well acted and had some faces in it that surprised me. If you watch Game of Thrones and Black Sails, you'll know what I mean.

6502058,5,B00LSW76MO,"I never thought I will write a review for a movie with Dracula.
But now justice has been done! It has action until the end. It has love until the end. It has passion and good soundtrack! It also has  a joke! It has a story and it shows you the story. That means you will maybe cry, cuddle, laugh and get scared.
It is not just a movie about Dracula, the one most people are used to. It is also a history lesson with great lines to remember. The filmmakers have done a great research, have put a lot of energy in understanding Vlads time and his personality. All in all, what I can say is that this movie matched both history books I have read about Vlads reign. Justice has been done, no matter how much Id like to see a movie about Vlad Tepes  something close to The Gladiator, that means without devil. The entire team has done a great job.
Vlad was a prince of innocents  and this has been shown across the entire script. Yes  it has DRACULA, but also the real history (the untold)  how great can that be: to keep a name alive for centuries as Dracula then revive it in all its greatness? How would world look like under the Ottoman Empire?
Vlad Tepes is a hero because all he wanted was peace and justice while all he had was a small army and God. Thats how he defended Christianity and Wallachia (nowadays ~half Romania).

I recommend you not to only see the movie, but to also buy it. I am not sure if Id like a sequel more than a prequel. Whatever it will be  it must be at least to this level of Dracula Untold.",1426809600,,1519,4.128813559322034

6502062,4,B00LSW76MO,"Luke Evans IS the film. The story is easy to digest.  Most of its appeal comes from the acting talents of Evans, Charles Dance,
and Dominic Cooper. The rest is a whole lot of C.G.I. razzle-dazzle, which is to be expected these days. Sometimes, however, I believe when you have talent such as Luke Evans in a film, the directors/writers should do more to showcase the actor's ability to act rather than  so much focus on technology.  I'm frankly a little weary of all the special 'effects' I see in films today. I say, let the actors ACT. I watch movies for the acting first, then story, then everything else. Put the emphasis back on story and use technology sparingly.

That being said, I recommend this film for a fun night with your 'significant other'. So grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy Luke Evans reveal his positively gorgeous body and fine acting!.",1426809600,,857,4.5816993464052285

6502074,3,B00LSW76MO,"This movie starts with the premise that the legend of Dracula begins with an historical figure named Vlad the Impaler, and then says: Let's make this guy real; lets try to make him sympathetic; lets show some of the struggles between empires that were going on at the time, and then let's make it fiction with some historical realism by imagining he really could become...a vampire.  Overall not revolutionary but reasonably decent.
As ""A World Undone"" explains nicely, the Balkan region (which includes the former Wallachia) was and still is a very turbulent place for 3 or 4 reasons: 1.  Beginning with the split of the Roman Empire into Eastern and Western, each to have its own emperor.  This also led to the split of the Christian church into Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox, and the usual wars of religion.  2.  On top of that the Moslems entered the picture, in the form of the Ottoman empire which extended into Europe from the east at least as far as the Danube.  As a result the Balkans had the largest indigenous Moslem population of the European ""continent"", causing yet more divisions.  3.  Russia was constantly seeking control of access to the Atlantic via the Mediterranean, and key to that was control of the narrow waterways from the Black Sea into the Mediterranean.  The Balkans are just to the west of this fault-line.  4.  Through constant wars, migrations and boundary shifts, the whole area is a co-mingled mass of groups deeply suspicious of each other...

As an example of making Vlad the Impaler seem a reasonable guy, he explains it thus: ""By impaling every living thing in one village, I saved 10 others, which quickly surrendered rather than endure the same horror.""  See?  Actually a nice guy, once you get to know him...

I rather suspect his ""bloodthirstiness"" grew into legends of him actually drinking the blood of his enemies, and from there to him as some only partly-human, partly satanic being of legend.  Certainly the movie is not to be taken as historically accurate, but in a general way it does set the background for the legend.",1426723200,,2077,4.792134831460674

This version, however, is based on the most original premise that defines and differentiates this version from all others.

It's beautifully directed and the acting is viscerally engaging. It's almost staged like a grand opera.

I would have preferred that the demise of all the vampires in the end would have brought down the curtain; however, I suppose it's only logical that his maker, who remained in hiding would revive him. How convenient for a possible sequel as we see Dracula and his maker strolling the streets in modern times. There are already far too many vampire stories saturating cable and the internet; hopefully the sequel (if there is one) will simply bring  the story to a satisfying conclusion as he has found his love reincarnated.",1426464000,,887,4.932885906040268

6502162,3,B00LSW76MO,"I love the story of Dracula and I found it interesting to show the beginning and how he changed. The Bram Stoker's book tells a little bit different story, but I liked that one as well. It was nicely done with good visual effects and a good story line. Having said that, something was missing, I am not certain what, but I had a feeling the movie was ""empty of emotion"". Yes, Luke Evans was great, but like the story was not exactly well told.",1426464000,,443,4.223529411764706
6502163,3,B00LSW76MO,"It is an interesting take on the Dracula legend, but the story is somewhat jumbled, rushed, and, in an effort to reinforce the story's ""darkness"", it's filming leaves a lot to be desired relative to simply viewing the movie.

6502166,5,B00LSW76MO,"Not too far a departure from the folklore known, but far enough that it stands well on its own. Not exceptionally gory, and filled with romance, it is a true love story. But there are graphics of horror and new tech visions, some haunting some cutting, like painful incisions. The flower does delight, yet after a time does wilt. The joy of love follows the angels' lilt. And then in the shadows, as darkness falls, the blood-lusting demons siren their calls. Be careful where your foot does tread, beside the living, and near the dead!  BLOOD!",1426377600,,544,4.666666666666667

As someone marginally aware of world history and culture, who values the diversity of the world we live in, I feel what could have made a decent ""supernatural"" vampire story with a really great cast and special effects was instead lost in a sad excuse for a plot. Hence, for me a complete disappointment!",1426377600,,544,4.787234042553192

6502343,4,B00LSW76MO,"Was an interesting twist on an old tale.  However much I like Luke Evans, he played Dracula, just a bit too ""boy scout"".  I know that the plot line seemed to demand it in order to give him a more altruistic nature but really, this was a guy that impaled people just to frighten his enemies (worked pretty well, I'd say).  And he did finally get into the ""meat"" of the part eventually.  Left us with the promise of a sequel, is that going to happen now that Charles Dance has been killed off on the Game of Thrones?",1425859200,,514,4.161616161616162

6502354,4,B00LSW76MO,"In Dracula Untold, Vlad (Luke Evans) chooses to become the monster he fears to defend his kingdom from the Turks.

This Dracula movie is something a little different instead of the typical Dracula sci-fi movies that have graced the screen over the years. This one incorporates some historic elements (although not necessarily historically accurate) to explore the beginning of the fictional Dracula tale. I liked the different original approach to the movie and plot. Evans does well in the role of Vlad who is torn from saving his son and people to facing basically an eternal role as the Son of the devil as he puts it. In this tale, Vlad (Dracula) is not quite the hero and not quite a villain either and it works for the story. The special effects are also well done and reflect dark grim world in which this is set creating the right mood. Although this does have some plot holes and misses the mark in a few places, I did find it enjoyable enough to watch.

3 and a half stars",1425772800,2,982,4.51123595505618

I've been a fan of the Dracula story since I was 8 years old, and I absolutely loved this version. It was refreshing. And what girl isn't swooning over Luke Evans right now? The fact that Charles Dance is in this had me clapping excitedly, as he is such an amazing actor. The story is amazing and still follows Vlad's life somewhat, but this one brings us his beginnings and shows us a little more into why he chose to become the vampire.",1425772800,,559,4.6
6502357,4,B00LSW76MO,Interesting take on the back story and what lengths a man will go through when those he cares about are in danger.,1425772800,,114,4.2272727272727275
6502358,5,B00LSW76MO,"I was very happy to see that this version expounded more on the history of how he became Dracula.  It explains that there was a man before the monster, who loved and raised a family, cared for those he was responsible for and who had to perform monstrous acts to protect those he loved.  Then, when no other choice was left he became a true monster to to effect safety for his people.  Modern technology plays a huge part in bringing to life the surreal aspect of an ancient tale making this latest re-telling well worth seeing.  From the original silent film ""Nosferatu"" through Gary Oldman's larger-than-life portrayal of Dracula and the Dracula 2000 film franchise we have been thoroughly entertained and Luke Evans has stepped-up and delivered.",1425772800,,748,4.8203125

6502395,4,B00LSW76MO,"I've got to say, I read the other reviews, and decided to just order it.  This was when Amazon had mis-published the page.  Initially it had said the running time was about 180 minutes.  I saw this and thought ""Really?!  An origin story of Dracula that is three hours long?"".  I was stoked because I love Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) despite some of its flaws.  I had also thought ""Well, I like the lead actor, too.  So, that helps"".
I received the movie, it's 90 some minutes long.....HALF of what Amazon had initially advertised.  They must have counted the special features.  I had looked again, and they had changed it.
All this aside.  It is a good movie.  Rushed in places.  Charles Dance doesn't have nearly enough screen time.  It's times like that, when Vlad meets this mysterious vampire that could have been explored a bit more, as well as spending more time on Vlad's changing.  But having said all this, it's worth a viewing.  It's got some decent acting, fair story, and fantastic landscape.",1425513600,,1005,4.662857142857143

6502478,3,B00LSW76MO,"Dracula as a character has had many incarnations over the years, from Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, to Frank Langella and Gary Oldman. All of these brought essentially the same story, but what distinguishes DRACULA UNTOLD is that it tells the heretofore ""untold"" origin story of one of literature's most enduring villains. Or is he really a villain? That's also something different that this retelling/reboot brings to the table: it recasts its titular character as a conflicted antihero, as is the fad right now. All of these elements could potentially make for a great film, but what Universal has delivered here is bland and uninspired at best. That's not to say this isn't a well-made film, but for all of the hoopla surrounding what is hoped to be the beginning of a Universal monster cinematic universe this film doesn't exactly inspire confidence in that regard.

 Even if you've never seen a Dracula film before, you probably already know about the character's origins as a Transylvanian prince. When the Turkish Sultan (Dominic Cooper) reinstates a tradition whereby 1000 Transylvanian boys (including Vlad's own son) are conscripted into his army, Vlad goes to a mysterious mountain in search of a way to protect his people. First, I'll get the positives out of the way. For the most part, the acting is solid. Luke Evans is decent as the titular Dracula, and he does a good job of selling him as a conflicted character. Dominic Cooper, although maybe miscast as Sultan Mahmed/Mahmoud, still acquits himself nicely by turning in a decent performance as well. I also liked some of the production design and sets. The visual effects were little more hit or miss, though. The first couple of times they show an effect of someone turning into a group of bats was pretty cool, but then they reuse that same effect over and over again. To make matters worse, using it so much obscured a lot of what was going on in and around it.

 This leads me to what is probably my biggest gripe: the bowdlerization of what is actually some fairly adult source material. Leaving aside the sexual metaphor of being bitten by a vampire for a little bit, Vlad in real life was an extremely violent and cruel man who intimidated invading armies by impaling people on stakes for them to see, hence his nickname. Not that the film needed to show this happening, but in general the film goes out of its way to obscure violence of any kind, be it sword fights or whatever. For a film about a bloodsucking madman, this film is curiously lacking in that department. What few battle sequences there are also take place at night, and the darkness serves as yet another way of hiding the brutal reality of medieval warfare. The film also neuters its source material by eliminating almost any sexual connotation associated with being bitten by a vampire, and worst of all never shows any penetration when someone is bitten. All of this combines to create the feeling that the PG-13 was used for profitability instead of being a purely artistic choice.

 Still, I wasn't ever bored while watching this. Sure, the story wasn't too original or even that well written, but despite my complaints I still think that this will satisfy the demographic its being targeted towards. The acting is decent, as is the general look of the film, despite being overly dark in some scenes. Overall, it probably won't win over any fans of previous versions of Dracula, but it is a suitably entertaining popcorn movie for the tween/teenage crowd.",1425254400,3,3506,4.8156146179401995

Which in a way wasn't really a bad thing although the movie was really predictable with or without the creative licensing on the Dracula story. Not quite sure where they got the whole weakness to silver thing and the weakness to sunlight(this one is kind of understandably though to fit the generally accepted idea of a vampire). Dracula himself following the book didn't have any of those weaknesses but I know this movie wasn't following the book in anyway shape or form. So for a stand alone movie outside of its predecessors it's a decent movie, but it is predictable and characters are forgettable very early on except of course Dracula.

6502499,3,B00LSW76MO,"This was a nice little popcorn movie.  The main reason to watch this is the performance of Luke Evans. I first noticed him when he completely stole the show in that otherwise mediocre Edgar Allan Poe movie with John Cusack (the Raven).  The guy has a sincere, brooding quality on screen, and he was well-cast though maybe ineffectively used in The Hobbit. I've been thinking that this guy is a budding superstar, and it was interesting to see him in a project like this since playing Dracula seemed to fall outside the heroic type character he seems destined to play.  Was this going to be a career defining role?  Would it show off a range we didn't know he had?

Well...what they did was rewrite the whole Dracula mythos to make him kind of heroic. Honestly, I didn't have a problem with that because we've seen Dracula come to life so many times that it's nice to see a new twist on the old story.  Luke Evans does make Dracula appealing, he even makes him seem noble.  He does this all while also making Dracula appear very, very deadly.

Put it this way, even before Evans becomes a vampire, he's the guy who goes marching into battle without a sword. It's as if he's thinking, ""meh...why bother...I'll just grab one from one of my enemies and then keep it after I've cut the guy to ribbons.""  The more nonchalantly you're able to pull off this little maneuver, the cooler you look (and Evans is as nonchalant as they come).

So, yes, Evans is memorable from this film, but that's just about the only thing. That being said, there are rumors that this film turned enough of a profit that we might be treated to a sequel or two. When the next one comes out, I'll grab it and be assured of another good popcorn night. Fans of action will be entertained, fans of horror (and Dracula specifically) will probably be disappointed by this one.  This is an enjoyable work easy to revisit.",1425254400,,1885,4.482456140350878

But, Dracula's wife is just down right whiny throughout the whole film. She is so whiny I recommend you take two advil & then watch it for the fx and action scenes.

Charles Dance is GREAT as always in his supporting role. I will most likely watch the part two but i really am torn on watching it if they still cast this woman. I loathed her role in the film, her voice, her scripted dialog it was all just too painful.

So, if you love Fx, vampire films, charles dance, action, and Luke Evans watch this. If you have no tolerance for weak, whiny female characters don't... I still shudder remembering her voice it's that shrill. :(",1425254400,,764,4.45

Most of the reviews objected to the plot, to the humanization of Vlad, and to the ""video game/superhero"" action sequences but in this movie these are to me it's strongest features. Also, all of these things have appeared, in lesser or greater effect, in the dozens of retelling of Dracula.  In this movie, the tropes worked. Love is stronger than death, Monsters are MADE not born, and we live or die by the choices we make. Dracula (1992) had a similar premise, albeit with more ambiguity, and okay, greater cinematic flair. Make no mistake, it is NOT an Oscar contender but it worked for me. It was thrilling, the actors gave excellent performances and it was not a stupid movie. And the action scenes were dope. ALL the stars.

Is it ironic that real bats are necessary--they eat billions of bugs and have sonar and even jamming software--but are endangered species?  Maybe not ironic, but true.  One star removed because I wish the vampire craze would subside.  Am I jealous?  No female has ever wanted me to bite her on the neck.

I was really looking forward to this movie so when I saw that it received poor ratings I was a little bummed and decided to wait until it came out on DVD to rent it. After watching it I honestly really liked it! Sure it wasn't a super deep or twisting plot but it was still just a basic good monster movie. It was just fun to watch. The special effects were really cool and Luke Evans isn't bad to look at either. There were a few minor details in the plot that were a bit cheesy, but it didn't detract from the film overall. Although I wouldn't buy this film it was certainly worth the watch. If you are looking for a deep and pivotal take on Dracula this probably isn't the film for you. But if you are looking for a fun easy to watch movie with a straight forward story and fun special effects then I would say go for it.",1425081600,,896,4.096590909090909

6502622,5,B00LSW76MO,"I had many doubt the legitimacy of another vampire movie when I recommended this one, but I have had none walk away disappointed. The story of Vlad the impaler is one that many do not know Dracula was derived from. He was notorious for impaling the soldiers in his enemies' armies and was even noted for having once forced a defeated enemy to eat his family after seeing them cooked alive. With Vlad's history set aside, this story is extremely well told and incorporates the idea a vampires into this history lesson without causing too much disbelief. The animation is superb and the acting done by Charles Dance and Luke Evans convinced me of the plausibility of a man so desperate that he would ""sell his soul to the devil"". I have seen some negative reviews, but it seems to be by those hoping this movie would be something different. This isn't Underworld and it certainly isn't a historically accurate piece of film, but taking this well crafted story for what is it, Dracula Untold delivers. It is fun to watch on a date or with the family and brings up some interesting concepts surrounding the legends of Vladmimir, the impaler.",1425081600,,1137,4.661691542288557

6502725,4,B00LSW76MO,"Interesting take on the legend of Dracula. I actually liked very much Dracula's back story and the ""bargain"" he chose to make to save his son, family and subjects. The story was steeped in the actual conflict of Christians vs invading Turks in this insanely rugged part of the world. I guess you could call this an historical novel of sorts. I could heap praise on the CGI, art direction (very illustrative) and extraordinarily detailed costumes, armor and weapons, but the story was authentic sounding and Hell, I liked it!",1424736000,,524,4.833333333333333

6502728,4,B00LSW76MO,"intense acting on both actor and actress.  I thought the screenplay is well written and mirrors the traditional Dracula except for the love of his wife and son.  It shows that Dracula was an outstanding Count that cared for his family and people in his kingdom.  The CG effects are amazing in my humble opinion.  I'd watch it again as well as any sequel.

6502778,4,B00LSW76MO,"We had seen the horrible reviews on this movie so decided to not go see it at the theater as we had originally intended to do.  We felt that while the movie was a great deal of overkill on the CGI, the story line itself was a good one and didn't leave ""Dracula"" as the evil person that he truly was, but more of a man just trying to stop a war that had been raging on for centuries and also a family man protecting his family and those in his village and not a heartless murderer as history has told that he was.  Made for a good re-telling/alternative version of an old tale.  I say rent it ,watch it and judge for yourself.",1424649600,3,625,4.024193548387097

6502781,4,B00LSW76MO,"I Gave only 4 stars, not because it is a bad movie, it certainly isn't.  More because the history of what this Movie is dealing with is not defined in any congruent or educational way and if the title is Dracula Untold, I thought it really should be more specific in the untold story.
 The lead acting was terrific, special effects fabulous and worth watching for entertainment.  The only odd part about this story is that it almost makes you feel sorry for Vlad the Impaler.  That was disturbing to think that we, as humans, could empathize with another human being with an abhorrent reputation, albeit to protect his own lands which he had the right to do, and who knows what we ourselves would have done in the same situation.  Definitely food for thought.",1424649600,,759,4.592592592592593

6502786,4,B00LSW76MO,"I had lots of fun with this movie. As many have said before, this is a half based on history and half Universal's attempt at making Dracula an action hero. I don't have a problem with this (of all the old monsters in Universals library Dracula seems the most poised at this attempt). Mr Luke Evans does a great job at portraying the protagonist, when the camera is on him, he is all you see.

The CGI work is good and it serves it's purpose. I suppose if one wanted to poke holes in the story or certain aspects about the movie one could, like how a freshly minted Dracula has almost complete mastery over his new found skills almost immediately, yet struggles with certain pedestrian tasks.

But these are movies after all, and action movies at that. Some suspension of disbelief is required and the greatest question one must ask is, ""are you having fun?"" and ""are you being entertained?""

The movie delivers. You may quench your curiosity. It may not have done exceptionally well in the theater but that fact alone should not make you stay away.",1424649600,,1048,4.534391534391534

6502809,4,B00LSW76MO,"In May od 1897 the manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London published a supernatural novel to supplement his income.  That novel was Dracula.  That manager of the famous theatre was a man named Bram Stoker.  In his fictitious novel the main character is a 400-something-year old nobleman from Transylvania who happens to crave human blood and is pretty much immortal, along with other amazing powers.  He is one of the most famous fictional characters of all time.  He was also loosely based of a man who actually existed.  Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia.  Vlad The Impaler.  From the House of Draculea, a branch of the House of  Basarab.  Vlad Dracula.  Well, Dracula Untold is the more accurate story of Vlad III, minus some of the Stoker-isms, but not all.  Vlad III(Luke Evans) must pay tribute to the Sultan (Dominic Cooper) in order to keep the peace in Transylvania (Romania), but when the Sultan demands 10,000 young boys to join his army, Vlad is perplexed.  When he visits the Sultan to reason with him, the Sultan takes everything a step further and demands that among the 10,000, Vlad's son should be counted.  Torn between protecting his family and starting another war with the Turks, Vlad defies the Sultan by killing his envoy.  With war eminent and their slaughter on the way in the form of the Turkish army, Vlad seeks out the aid of a nether-worldly creature skulking in a cave amongst the Carpathian mountains.  A vampire (grotesquely portrayed by Charles Dance).  Dracula Untold is fast-paced and dark, yielding a closer historical  version of Vlad Tepes  than Stoker originally proffered to us.  Action packed and brutal with loving touches hidden here and there.  My only issue is the PG-13 tag.  I would have like to see what the adults didn't get to see.  And the little story swish of Vlad The Impaler.  In the film the Sultan implies that Vlad's reputation as the impaler was under his life as a political prisoner, in the Sultan's army.  We know that isn't the case.  The actual Vlad was reputed to do terrible things with his victims, impaling and such, to build a frightening reputation in order to keep his country safe.  Word of his horrors spread far and wide, keeping enemies thinking twice about roaming into his lands.  In Romania Vlad is considered a hero.  He was considered a remarkable man.  A fresh take on an old story.  Definitely worth the watch.

6502837,5,B00LSW76MO,"First off, I was hesitant on whether or not Dracula Untold would be any good considering that it's only rated PG-13, but it turns out that I was happily surprised at how much I liked it.  I'm the type of person who love superhero origin stories, and that's exactly what Dracula Untold ended up being.  That being said, this film is not your typical vampire movie, and instead of focusing on the horror aspects of vampires Untold puts a superhero like twist on the classic legend of Dracula.  Furthermore, Untold showed audiences a side of Vlad that films in the past had never shown, and felt like a refreshing take on a role that's been played to death.  No pun intended.  Film fans finally saw the human side of Vlad before he becomes the monster known as Dracula, but that's not where the good ends in Untold.  I loved the locations the film makers chose, even though some locations were not historically accurate, but they did fit the mood of the film perfectly.  Lastly, I want to point out how good the acting was, especially the acting of Charles Dance (Game Of Thrones) who played the role of The Master Vampire.  The bottom line is that Dracula Untold is not your typical vampire movie, and is more like a super hero action origin story than a film that focuses on the scary side of vampires.  I highly recommend seeing this film at least once, especially if you like Game of Thrones.  I really hope there's going to be a sequel, because they left many questions unanswered, but some times it's a good thing to have questions after a film.

6502845,4,B00LSW76MO,"This is an exciting spin on the traditional Dracula story that's been ingrained in contemporary culture. Here we get the driving motivation that forces Vlad to make the deal he did to give him the power and strength he needed to vanquish his enemies and protect those he loved in a world of kill or be killed. The ruthlessness of Vlad would become the stuff of legend and thus is born a dark hero and his reign of terror.

6502885,5,B00LSW76MO,"""Dracula Untold"" does a great job developing the character of Vlad (Dracula) from the legend. It is an interesting and exciting retelling -- adding more depth with the addition of his wife and son. His character is more sympathetic. His ability to be a monster or a hero - as the situation calls for -- is what makes the movie interesting. Special effects and displays of his immense power are what make the movie exciting. It is fairly well plotted (a good thing, because I believe movie goers are sick to death of bad plots these days). Many films in this genre spend too much time concentrating on developing the character and not enough time showing what the hero can do once special powers are acquired. The hero's abilities are what sets him apart from the rest of us, and part of what makes him fascinating. In ""Dracula Untold,"" the viewer gets to witness some fabulous shows of power, but also of character - both the good and bad. Good movie for this genre. I do recommend it.",1424476800,,985,4.53932584269663
6502886,4,B00LSW76MO,"I watched this movie without great expectations.  For me, that's a good thing because when I anticipate being a little disappointed it helps prevent me from expecting too much.  (""Frozen"" is an example.  From all the rave reviews, I expected it to be a knock-out movie.  I was sorely let down by it.)  I was underwhelmed by the trailers I had seen for ""Dracula Untold"" but there were enough positive customer reviews to prompt me to take a chance.  Obviously, this movie is fiction but it is one that I felt blended historical fact, fiction, and mythology quite nicely.  Other reviewers are much better than I at analyzing the movie so I will not tread that ground again, only render my own overall opinion.  Though flawed, ""Dracula Untold"" is a refreshing take on the vampire mythology, one that mercifully does not include sparkly vampires.  Vlad is a flawed yet noble antihero, one who is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of his people and his family; a man willing to reluctantly embrace darkness in order to protect his loved ones and those under his leadership.  I found Luke Evans' portrayal to be surprisingly relatable; taking us from the man to the myth with a deft mixture of tenderness, fierce protectiveness, and a touch of quiet humor.  There were some things that disappointed me, like the perpetuation of the erroneous belief that sunlight can destroy Dracula (Is Hollywood really that adverse to reading the actual source material??) and trying to convince me that a human can plummet an ungodly distance and still be conscious, unbloodied, intact, and able to speak coherently...  (Yeah, I'm still gnashing my teeth about that because they could have worked around the issue.  I get Sheldon Cooper about such details when they so flagrantly fly in the face of logic, physics, and/or biology.  I can suspend disbelieve only so far.  But I digress.)  While ""Dracula Untold"" is not a great movie, I feel it is an interesting and fun take on a well-worn, nearly threadbare, subject.  ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is still my favorite vampire movie though, despite Winona Rider's flinch-after-death and Keanu Reeve's usual wooden acting.  With the exception of the ever-fascinating Gary Oldman's magnetic performance in ""Bram"", I think the acting in ""Dracula Untold"" is more even.  I think it was an excellent choice to select actors for their talent rather than how big a box-office draw their name brings.  Luke Evans was a pleasant surprise and Charles Dance gave his usual solid performance, giving his character a slippery yet somehow almost regal quality.  I look forward to watching it again.",1424476800,,2616,4.954128440366972

I thought that it was a different take on the legend of Dracula, here we have him as a loving father and husband and ruler who is trying to give his family and subjects and good life free of Turkish intervention. What he does he does so that his people can live. Luke Evans is Dracula and he has the part down pat in as far as this story is put forward. Dominic Cooper is his ex-friend and ruler of Turkey who tries to force Dracula to give him the children of Transylvania to add to his army. The performances of those two and some others are terrific.

6503435,1,B00LSW76MO,"I have a few complaints about this movie.
1. Dracula's son depreciated the value of this film.  He seems like a little crybaby or young girl.  For a multimillion dollar movie, the director should have selected a stronger, more dominant boy.

2.  Vlad used the wrong swords throughout the entire movie.  The real Vlad the Impaler used a wicked curved sword known as the Kilij.  Unlike the actor in this movie, the real Vlad was not a fool.  He understood that the Kilij can cause severe damage to human flesh with the fraction of the effort of using a standard long sword.

3.  The impalement scenes are not correct.  Only blunt poles were used by the true Vlad the Impaler to prolong agony.  Also, the insertion of these blunt tools were different.

4.  The vampire bats of this movie do not make any sense to me.  True vampire bats originate and dwell in Central American/South America. They prefer to lap up blood from chickens and cattle.  There is no way that any vampire bat evolved in Transylvania/Walachia.

6.  For someone who tries to be so masculine, the main actor is practically hairless all over like a teenage boy.  He should at least try to grow a beard if he thinks he can bark orders at seasoned veterans.  I was surprised that he did not have a genuine goatee at least.

My point is that the director did not do his research adequately.  Because of this ignorance. I give his movie a single star. I could have directed a significantly better film than the ignorant director.",1423958400,10,1492,4.554716981132075

6503443,1,B00LSW76MO,"Luke Evans is wasted in this movie. He is obviously a talented actor, that showed despite his starring in this horrible movie. That his acting ability shone through bad dialogue, boring scenes and impossible plot says alot for him. It is a real shame he didn't land in a better role. I will look for his next film.

Dracula Untold should have been good. It has everything, vampires, swords, fight scenes, great sets and costumes, but it was terrible. My sister fell asleep and I played on my phone the whole time. The dialogue is bad, out of character and doesn't fit either the setting, the subject or the characters. I got the distinct impression that this whole script was written by an adolescent boy. Every scene that was supposed to be scary, suspenseful and excite was instead utterly boring. Every fight scene was either skipped or shown in bits and pieces through reflections or shadows. I'm not sure if this was to cut down on blood and gore (if that's true, why even bother making a VAMPIRE movie at all) or to save money on special affects, but it was a huge epic fail. Again, why bother with a vampire movie at all if you're going to out right skip the blood?

The plot was just implausible to the point of being utterly ridiculous. Characters make a harrowing climb of a mountain cliff in minutes without a stain on their clothes and aren't the least out of breath, a monster in a save up this isolated, monstrous cliff has a cave full of skeletons of men he's killed because apparently travelers without family or friends just happen to stumble into that cave all the freaking time, and when our hero has 3 days to destroy his enemies, he spends entire nights brooding and worrying and basically wasting time. Bad guys show up in the throne room unannounced and everyone is shocked because I guess there are no guards or look outs or staff to announce their approach or presence? And, to top it all off, Turkey seems to be full of blond, blue eyed men and women.

Like I said, my sister fell asleep and I ended up reading terrible reviews about this movie online, something I definitely should have done BEFORE I paid money for this.

Yes, Luke Evans is someone who deserves better, and every decent actor has to start somewhere.

6503470,3,B00LSW76MO,"Good acting and nice scenery, but didn't really add anything to the Dracula story, and this Dracula didn't seem to match up to the one portrayed in Bram Stoker's novel. This Dracula is just...too nice, I guess. He did all that impaling, but then he's this terrific family man. I don't know, I would have liked him better if he was darker in nature, I think. However, I do love this genre, and ultimately I was glad I rented it. If you like special effects and gore, as I do, then you'll probably like this one too.

6503477,5,B00LSW76MO,"Just a casual viewer here, a bored soul looking for a decent rental. I am no Dracula / Vampire aficionado.

Hence, I was able to watch this and enjoy it for what it is and not for what I expected a classic ""Dracula"" story to be. I once watched Bram Stoker's Dracula when I was a kid and only remember a lot of artful talking, followed by me eventually falling asleep. Although, I did have fun playing many Castlevania video games as a young one which didn't exactly follow the same Dracula in films.(mostly action, lite story)

I suppose I'm merely trying to say, this does not resemble any of the Dracula characters I was familiar with. This movie is Dracula in name only because the main character seeks to harness the power of a vampire.

Naturally, if I was a Dracula fan, expecting a Dracula film, I would've been highly dissapointed to have been misled by this title. Almost seems like false advertising.

But hey, I just wanted to watch something different. Thankfully, this one turned out to be quite original and much better than I anticipated.",1423785600,2,1053,4.585106382978723

I have watched many movies about Dracula and this is a story like with the ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman Begins"" that tells how that he comes to be and what he pays in return for his victory over his enemies that want more than he is prepared to give them. Being raised as a brother to his foe he has to turn over what he loves most and holds dear to his heart,so e begins a trek to a place he had left behind before with what men fear most and that's fear itself!

The angle they take and the way they make you feel for him as person it something else. It leaves off.....well I am sure you have read other reviews. Many have said this movie was stupid and boring well to me it held me because I wanted to know. I needed to know. I am not a vampire fan have never been. Werewolves and lycans all the way. Twilight is crap lol. In all for a fang movie that makes you hope that redemption is out there for sure.

I mean, one second Dracula can fly anywhere he wants, and single handedly destroy a whole army of men. Then when he needs to just kill 1 normal dude, it gets all stretched out into some nonsense dramatic war, and he can't even defend his castle he sent everyone to (because it's easier to defend).

This new version provides the backstory of Vlad the Impaler, and I found the ending unexpected and very romantic. The writers used the issues with ISIL to their advantage in the brutality of the Turks -- for example, the taking of thousands of small boys and forcing them into battle. I found myself seriously involved, rooting for Vlad's meager army as they fought against them. I loved the character of Vlad and this entire backstory. And I really loved the glimpse into the future offered in the final scene. It's fast moving -- and the backstory provides an entirely new slant. This is not an intellectual film by any means, but it gives the old mythologies fresh blood.",1423267200,,799,4.673758865248227

I loved the fresh perspective of post-battlefield Vlad, and seeing such a completely different side of the story. By the end of the movie I find myself still wanting more, and the ending is just the perfect little intriguing and touching encounter.

Great actors, great costumes, great drama, great special effects, great music, and not least excellent production, editing, and directing. The ending is perfect. Ignore the naysayers and watch it. It's deliciously shocking. There was a reviewer who started by giving away the whole film (hello, spoiler), then in an effort to look like a wannabe film critic got stingy with the stars. I would give it 6 stars, because it embodies everything a movie experience should have: it's engaging, it draws you in, it shows you what happens to everyone it introduces, it settles the score between protagonist and antagonist, and you feel good walking out while the credits roll.

I like the idea that he wasn't all bad, and he ""made a deal with the devil"" so to speak, to save his family and his people that looked to him for their very survival.  This is thought provoking in that, maybe he became a vampire as a sacrifice versus what we have always known that he became a vampire out of just sheer anger and revenge. In this movie he uses his dark powers more positively than we have read or seen in any other media source. Applause for the actor, the settings, and costuming, not to mention the graphics.

  It really bent the story around for Vlad the Impaler and Dracula and just wasn't very accurate like someone else already wrote.
  It was PG13 so they could get more parents to bring their kids to the movie. I would have preferred a more adult version rate ""R"", but then parents would have hesitated to bring the kiddie's- which is understandable.
  In my opinion they depended on those CGI shots to boost the movie because really the acting was only so,so.

6503581,3,B00LSW76MO,"When this movie first came out I had serious doubts about it because of all the films about Dracula and most of them not very faithful to the
Book or the legends of Vampires.  The only movie that portrays the original story more or less correctly was BRAM STOKERS DRACULA.  This
movie while entertaining and worth seeing if you don't care about the accuracy of the story then you might want to get it, its not expensive.  The
effects are good, acting fine and some good haunting Transy settings.  But I found the story, well, pretty awful.  They could not even get the names
correct: Dracula means Son of the Dragon; this Dracula says it means Son of the Devil....NOT CORRECT!  Vlad Dracula did terrorize the Moslem
Turks but with stakes through the butts, not by sucking their blood or beating them to death with bat poo.  He became known as Vlad the Impaler
not Vlad the  Hicky giver!  And to my knowledge Vlad the younger did not have any sons, though I  could be wrong about that.  His wife did jump
off a tower and killed herself when she thought Drac was dead.  She was not pushed off a Turk.  The sun does not kill Vamps though this movie
continues the silly idea: Vampires usually sleep in a box or coffin contain their native soil; that helps them regenerate their powers.  It they go
out  in the daytime the sun weakens their powers and makes them easier to kill.  Best head for the ole coffin for a nice days rest & recovery.
Who was that creature in the cave at the beginning; was that supposed to be the Devil?  Ughy chap and Nassstttyyyy.
  Still, I give it a passing grade for entertaining values and good production techniques.  And I like LEGENDARY PICTURES  who probably
the primary producers of this interesting if confusing story telling and a good cast.  THREE STARS but I do recommend this for Dracula and
vampire admirers but not for those who like to see classics such as DRACULA (the book) more accurately portrayed .  I got mine from Amazon,
enjoy and keep a crucifix handy!",1423094400,,2000,4.4944444444444445

I really don't care about the historical Inaccuracy because I realize it is just a movie & will not be historically accurate no matter how much us viewers would like it to be. I had more problems with believing that a wife, child, or any one for that matter would be so willing to become a monster no matter what the reason. I just could not fathom calling my father, father after seeing him bite another on the neck & drink his blood & I certainly would never tell my husband to bite me nor ever want him to touch me again after seeing what he turned himself into.

Dracula Untold just doesn't deliver.

There's nothing fresh or original in it, until the last five minutes---then it gets a little interesting.

It was great how they used the ""vlad the impaler"" old school who was orginally said to be the first in vampire ""folk Lore"" if thats what its called. But truthfully this ended up being my favorite dracula movie i  had ever scene it wasn't your typical cheesy ""player"" who went along picking up random women on his Leisure by whispering something in there ear. It was a ""Game of Thrones, Merlin king Arther"" type environment with castles and old school build housing. It had enough romance and enough action to make a great start to a potential series.",1423008000,,945,4.46242774566474

The storyline is fantastic on so many levels, most importantly is the fact that this film finally tells us how Dracula came into existence. The actors also performed admirably across the board to cause you to believe everything that takes place especially Luke Evans. The action sequences and the special effects are great and will keep you jumping. Probably the best reason to see this movie is the fact that Dracula will do some things that you have never seen him do before.

6503626,5,B00LSW76MO,"Here's what I'll say. In the action movie canon, there are formulas. We know them, we kind of love them, but we can grow tired of them. I was, admittedly, expecting as much from this film. Yes, it was sold as a darker take on the Dracula myth, but I figured ""Sure it is. There's no way Luke Evans isn't the typical brooding but heroic protagonist who gets the movie star moments and lines."" And that's where this story surprised me. It's dark. Like not the cinematography, though admittedly that's the case. Evans is a broken man in this story, and while you're rooting for him in theory, you don't ever think ""Yeah, I totally trust him, I know he'll do the right thing.""

The visuals are 75% echoes of things we've seen before, but the 25% that's new is very new and different. Again, that's kind of why I'm giving it the rating I'm giving. This wasn't a summer big, 4th of July film. It kind of snuck up on me, and I was just...happy with it. Satisfied that I'd seen a good story, by people who wanted to do something genuinely different ... which is not all that common.

The teacher in the mountains was rumored to be Satan.  All in all a great film!  Romance, drama, action, story, characters.  I only wish it had been 60 minutes longer so we could have had the backstory more complete of Vlad's childhood, father, and Vlad's exploits as ""Lord Impaler.""

The movie omits a lot of what's in the trailer and frankly it tries to put a positive spin on the rankest of evils. Watch it if you're wanting to waste your money, you might even like that it has no real plot and that the storyline, well, I'm still trying to figure that out. Hmmm.

I won't spoil this review with spoilers because it's so lame. This whole movie suffers from a continuity issue, terrible script, terrible acting and a lot of useless boring dialogue. During this movie i also couldn't help notice how they mixed up a lot of the history in the film being that the timeline doesn't correlate together. I've also seen several reviews claiming that this is the best dracula film ever made, fair enough but in actuality that's absolute trash. There is very little in the way of character development of any sort and the storyline is predictable and lacks any ability to grasp the viewer and have them fully immersed it.
Now as a chick flick sort of drama with some adventure action thrown in there some people might not mind, that this movie doesn't exactly follow the true canon story arc of dracula, but rather throws in a lot of re-imagined fantasy. In short the production value, cinematography, direction, acting, and especially screenplay, are as dead as a door nail. Not only is this film bad but the film is undeniably a snooze fest, simply because we don't know and don't care about any of the characters. They're all vapor. The actors have no impact and leave a meaningless performance on set. Why was this film made ? the sword fights are distasteful and the exposition is obvious.

6503676,4,B00LSW76MO,"...and sometimes it needs a good ol' monster movie. And if you're looking for a lavish, action-packed, solid origin tale for Count Drrrraculaaa, look no further than Dracula Untold. This movie genuinely impressed me. I went in expecting a movie filled with generic action, bad dialogue, a turgid romance and over-acting. What I got was one-and-a-half hours of royal entertainment, sumptuous costumes, lavish sets, dazzling special effects and an excellent performance from Luke Evans! I left feeling satisfied and excited.

But yeah, this movie has all those flaws too. Dracula Untold has a simple storyline and is littered with fantasy cliches (Gary Shore is no Peter Jackson). It's early action scenes are muddled, filmed with shaky cam and butchered in the editing room. The dialogue is overblown and a few of the actors are a little questionable. Oh, and PS, this movie gets no points for historical accuracy. There, that's all the flaws out of the way. Now we can focus on the awesome parts in this movie, and there are MANY of those.

First off, the best word I can use to describe this movie is sumptuous. This is a sumptuous movie. Legendary costume designer Ngila ""Lord of the Rings"" Dickson deserves an Academy Award for designing the most lavish and downright beautiful costumes, armor, and robes this side of Middle Earth. When coupled with the equally lavish, rich, and stunning sets, you have the look of a downright gorgeous movie any way you cut it.

I guess the visual style needs more mentioning. The movie starts off muddled, unsure of whether it should go full blown Gothic or for a more sleek and modern polish. The action scenes are missing that bite (no pun intended) that will come in later. But as we advance, director Gary Shore gets more comfortable with the shadows, rainy forests, and open flames, and starts filming shots that are grandiose and epic in the best way. A field of a thousand corpses, a red cape blowing on a cliff, a man walking in a lightning storm...these are the shots that make cinema worthwhile! Oh, and the special effects are actually rather dazzling. They give the action scenes that extra oomph and are also just spectacular to watch.

Speaking of spectacular, this is Luke Evans's movie all the way. Bringing that same calm gravitas, moral certitude, and quiet power that he brought to Bard the Bowman, Luke Evans holds the screen and the attention with his portrayal of the flawed yet noble Prince Vlad. It's a performance that's far better than it needed to be, and the movie is better for it too. Charles Dance gets to chew scenery (and people) as an ancient and powerful vampire, and Dominic Cooper is also having fun as the Sultan Mehmed, an all-powerful bully with impeccable hair. In all the cast is solid, while the mighty Luke Evans is the true standout.

In conclusion, while muddled, occasionally cliched, and perhaps lacking a bit of gravitas, Dracula Untold is absolutely a movie I recommend to fans of fantasy, epic war films, or good ol' fashioned vampire fun. It's led by the excellent Luke Evans, features some dazzling special effects, epic action, and some real human (sorry, vampire) drama about what it means to be a monster. 4/5 blood-sucking stars! Now where's my sequel?",1421971200,25,3248,4.845045045045045

6503685,4,B00LSW76MO,"Solid mixing of historical fact, folklore, and fiction.  And a damn good action-horror film.  Vlad is likable, admirable, brave, and forced into a lose-lose situation.  Compelling him to strive against two scary foes, all to save his beloved family (and his ungrateful people).  Incredible performances throughout, beautiful settings, and excellent special effects.  We also get treated to a surprise ending that promises a sequel.

Dracula Untold has its flaws, though.  Some really annoying ones, so be warned (LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD):

The violence is excellent, except when it gets mired in special effects.  The writers got way too bat-happy with this story.  Almost to the point of ruining some spectacular scenes.  Ok, we get it.  He can control bats and fly in the form of a colony of bats.  When Vlad fights in the form of a man, the fun is back on.  When the bats arrive, it just feels like lazy production and storytelling.

Characterization of Vlad and his wife and child are sufficient, but nobody else--nobody--gets any characterization.  So, when certain plot twists go down, we are left wondering why.  Sometimes asking, ""So what?""  Interesting-looking minor characters on both sides remain cardboard set pieces.  Not cool.  This movie could have been a more in-depth epic.

Then there are the unexplained stupidities:

Vlad is instructed that he can also use any other creatures considered of the night.  See through them, sense through them, use them in battle.  Where were they?

He has powers of telekinesis like his creator.  Why didn't he use them?

Why do his vampire children turn on him?  He can't control them?

Why do they instantly view humanity as the enemy?  Vlad didn't when he was turned.

Then we have the Sultan.  He is SOOO comfortable with having to face Dracula and potentially Dracula's sire!  Why?  We are given no reason to understand this wacko confidence he has in himself.  How did he know to use silver in his battle?  Frankly, it ruined the tension.  Again, lazy writing.

Why does silver weaken and harm vampires?

Does sun kill vampires or not?  Vlad takes quite a few hits from the sun.  One a very nasty, unexpected attack.

The son of Dracula narrates in the beginning.  Then, we have no idea what became of him in the end.  He runs off with an oddly-knowledgeable priest, yes.  (Never a good idea for a young boy.)  But why is he narrating if he has nothing special to do with the story?  And why is that weird priest acquainted with vampires?  Nothing explained.  Lazy writing.

Lazy writing almost kills this retelling of Dracula.  But there are enough tense moments, horrific encounters, and displays of vampirism in this film to keep you watching till the end.  The actors are PERFECT.  I cannot stress this enough.  They really kept the movie rolling when the logic failed.  Luke Evans is a spectacular Vlad Dracula.  Sarah Gadon and Art Parkinson as well.  Truly believable love story and father-son relationship brought to LIFE by these two!

I'd LOVE a sequel with the same actors, but none of the writers.

This movie, though suffers from some slight errors; overall it is enjoyable and, one of the few movies I haven't skipped through in recent years. A far superior movie to the entire Hobbit franchise; that's for sure - and enjoyable as its own take on the Dracula mythos. Also, Charles Dance does indeed, fill the roll of ""elder?"" vampire quite nicely; and Luke Evans is a very good face, and actor, for this role. But, that's just my opinion as a casual movie-goer with an over-abundance of the inability to suspend disbelief.  5 out of 5 stars from me, good enough.",1421712000,,688,4.677685950413223

Not just because he is able to capture the ferocity and might of Dracula's legend, but also because he is able to show the audience that Vlad Tepes and Dracula have more than one dimension. Dominic Cooper was also fantastic in this movie, it would have been nice to see more of him as he was the primary nemesis, but the film does justice to the Dracula legend. It is not overbearing in gore, but creative with displaying the destructive and protective force that Vlad Tepes is thought to have been, while also standing up to the legend of Dracula, in a manner that is not too Hollywood. This story, while told many many times, in this case, was offered up in a different light, giving the viewer a chance to take in the characters in a manner which has not yet been seen in cinematic tradition of the retelling of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Additionally. the filmmakers do well to create a final scene that would allow them to return and pick up for a sequel that would not seem too forced. All in all, great film, wonderful performances, the graphic affects were great, especially with the bats and the way Evans' eyes shone red. I would definitely recommend this be seen by any Luke Evan's lover, appreciators of the Dracula story, and for general entertainment as it would also be a good film to pop in and watch with friends and/or family on a Friday or Saturday night.",1421712000,6,1476,4.5111940298507465
6503691,4,B00LSW76MO,"Possible Spoilers

This is a film whose premise is to create a beginning; a back-story if you will, for the narrative of Count Dracula. Thus, this re-imagined story of Vlad the Impaler, as the man who makes a deal with a proto-vampire - to save his people from the threat from the Ottoman Empire. Universal Picture's intends the film, to be a vehicle for its foray into the first of a series of re-imaged Universal Monster Films.

Visually, the film has the necessary iconography to encompass the Dracula character, while also managing to `ground' that iconography in its Medieval-style setting that feels fresh when married to, what could be considered over-exhausted foundation material. This is a film with good pacing, but the film's middle section feels at times mixed up and disjointed; it's hard to see certain scenes as sequential, a film that is more action drama - than horror.

Dracula Untold is not a deep film - it is a re-introduction, which is rather a good basic genre fare; it is comparatively fun in its portrayal of the monster in another light. While this film may not be very engaging as a standalone story, it does feel like a suitable entry point. With actors such as Evans and Dance in the mix - and add into the synthesis an alternate history there is still potential there.",1421539200,2,1299,4.713656387665198
6503692,3,B00LSW76MO,"Though critically panned, Dracula Untold is not that bad, as far as its visuals and the performance of the star Luke Evans as Vlad is concerned. Also, accusing the film of its historical inaccuracies is pointless because this is a dark fantasy about one of the most famous iconic characters in Western culture, not about the real Vlad, who is thought to be the model of Bram Stokers Dracula.

In the new film Vlad appears as a wise and respected ruler with a dark past, who has to make a tough decision when the Turkish Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) demands an impossible tribute including one involving Vlads own son Ingeras (Art Parkinson). But what can a small country like Transylvania can do, except accepting an offer from Master Vampire (Charles Dance) living in the deep cave? (Actually, the real Vlad was the ruler of Wallachia, but thats not the point.)

What is disappointing about the film is the lack of suspense. The films story attempts to interest with a few choices Vlad has to make, but most of us know the result from the beginning. Despite the impressive CGI, action sequences lack style and the character development is not very interesting.",1421366400,,1166,4.767326732673268

first of all, the acting was amazing!  Luke Evans was incredible in the role of dracula, i really felt for his character and with this performance, i am surprised that he is not a leading actor in hollywood right now.  all the actors on the whole were exceptional, yet he stood out the most.
the direction and visuals were wonderful and i enjoyed dracula's transformations while he flew through the armies, and i felt as if i was watching a greek tragedy: you already know the ending, but you are watching to see how matters unfold.
Sometimes, i have learned that the worst things to do is listen to other people when it comes to their preferences, because while some things are bad, there are those exceptions where something is good, but others look for the bad in it, so they find it.  If you go into this movie knowing what you are getting, you will see that it is quite wonderful and very well done.  is it perfect?  perhaps not, but what ever is?  also it was not deceptive.  if you watched the trailer for it, then it depicts the movie perfectly, instead of making it look better than what it was, or worse. overall, i would just say that sometimes don't knock things until you try them for yourself.  you may be surprised.",1420848000,9,1582,4.335593220338983

He knows that he can't defeat the Turks militarily and all attempts at diplomacy fail, so he ventures into the cave of a dangerous vampire.

It's about damn time somebody made a vampire movie with the ""Vlad the Impaler"" angle and its nice to step away from the recent adaptations of Vampires, such as Twilight; in which all of the Vampires look like Justin Beiber and seem ready to sprinkle pixie dust.

6503707,3,B00LSW76MO,"In nearly every frame of its 92 minute run time, ""Dracula Untold"" answers the age old question: ""What can they possibly do that is original with such a time worn character as Bram Stoker's vampire?""

  It is in the gothic atmosphere, lush and gloomy cinematography, dialogue and performances which recall perfectly Hammer's incantations of Dracula from the 60's and 70's with the lead performer, Luke Evans, giving resolve to the eloquent and classy feel of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee's various turns as this character.

  Throughout the pacing is rapid-fire yet, it still finds time to find, pardon the pun, the pulse of these types of characters (namely fully fleshing the leads out as people the audience cares about) which very few Horror films in general get right anymore.

  The decidedly more ""Lord of the Rings"" than the classic Universal Monsters feel usually is incredibly off putting in these modern rebirths of age tested creatures (as it was in the travesty ""I, Frankenstein"") but here it works wonderfully. Those fearing the C.G.I. will be too heavy handed (as it often is) need not fear as the effects are mostly well done and convincing.

  Often the jokes fall flat but they are few and far in between. The landscapes and sets are beautifully designed and it never goes too over the top.

  I went into this doubtful and came out quite satisfied. It is a B movie, and it never really forgets it, but its an entertaining, fun and fairly old-fashioned one (which ends in a semi-unique and satisfactory way) that isn't completely true to the original novel but it doesn't completely disrespect its legacy either.",1417132800,8,1634,4.890909090909091

6503712,4,B00LSW76MO,"I have to admit, I didn't think I would watch Dracula Untold and end up liking it. The previews were boring as hell. Luke Evans didn't seem like he had the talent to hold this project together. The MPAA slapped this with a PG-13 rating... Or was it director Gary Shore trying to reach a wider audience during the film's theatrical run? Either way, critics have universally panned Dracula Untold, and it holds (as of this date) a 24% aggregate rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The story itself is different from other vampire films. You could call it a ""prequel"" of sorts. Luke Evans stars as Prince Vlad Tepes, the medieval Romanian ruler famous for impaling opposing armies during warfare, or according to popular history, often just for fun. Nobody was spared during these altercations, and it was common to see woman and children amongst infantry dying slow and agonizing deaths. In Dracula Untold, we see Vlad's good side, a unifying nationalist who is completely for his people. Vlad's gruesome hobby of impalement is only given a slight wink. The infection with the vampire curse occurs as a last resort to stave off an invading Turkish army. Vlad happens to discover an ancient vampire deep within a cave system earlier in the film, and seeks his affliction later on to help him him in battle and keep his people from being slaughtered. However, this altruistic gesture comes with a steep price: if Vlad drinks human blood within 3 days of being infected, he is permanently transformed into a vampire and his infecter is set free.

The best segment of Dracula Untold occurs when the Prince leaves all human company behind and thrusts himself into the Undead's den. Charles Dance is excellent as the ancient ""Master Vampire,"" who is prehistoric in both age and appearance. The Master wears a cloak, with only his shriveled blue face and razor sharp nails visible. He is immediately stricken by Vlad's unwavering desire to be afflicted with the curse, and offers the Prince some of his blood. Vlad drinks this, gags, and finally collapses dead from this potent poison. He wakes up sometime later at dusk in the middle of a creek. It's at this point that director Gary Shore should have devoted much more screen time to allow Vlad the chance to test and become comfortable with his new found abilities. Vlad's vampirism is much like becoming a super-hero, and I feel the film would have been much better if it had placed more emphasis on the cultivation of his vampiric traits.

The film culminates with a large battle and one-on-one showdown with the Turkish Sultan. Aside from the acting talents of Luke Evans and Charles Dance, the rest of the cast is wooden, with some (such as the Prince's son) bordering on annoying. The story is more of a cliche medieval siege film than a vampire movie. The cloud of CGI bats that Price Vlad wields looks cheap, and is just plain bad film making. The final scene involves a random jump of about 500 years that is semi-interesting, but leads the viewer to believe that any sequels will evolve this franchise into an Underworld clone, or worse, Dracula 2000. Good vampire flick >>> 4 stars.",1416096000,9,3128,4.767527675276753
6503713,2,B00LSW76MO,"No. No, there won't be any asinine puns or jokes to be found here. It's already bad enough that vampires aren't regarded as the spawn of the Devil anymore in pop culture. Instead, they've been reduced to Dolce & Gabbana models that listen intently to emotionally incompetent teenage girls reading stupid poetry from their stupid binder in a stupid field of marigolds . It's stupid.

However, there have been a brave group of cinematic warriors who've fought the good fight to portray those who feast on the innocent in all of their unholy glory. Films like ""Let the Right One In"" and ""Afflicted"" have done justice to the mythological abominations.

""Dracula Untold"", even though it tries its hardest to reach that level of potential, ends up being a wasted effort that would make Sysyphus himself depressed.

The first red flag makes itself known immediately thanks to the film's title. ""Untold""? I guess all of those Hammer Dracula films, the Francis Ford Coppola remake, and a little thing called the ""Internet"" weren't sufficient enough to properly tell a concise background. Nevertheless, it does weave the vampire mythology with the history of the real life monster, Vlad the Impaler. Must be a boring job.

Like previous ""adaptations"" of iconic monsters like the Wolfman and Frankenstein, ""Dracula Untold"" tries to modernize the man and the mythos surrounding him by means of sub-par special effects. That's it. Beyond that, with the exceptions of Luke Evans' portrayal of Vlad and Charles Dances as the First Vampire residing in the cave, everything else consists of performers plucked from the local high school Actors Guild with equally cringe-inducing dialogue.

With that being said, both aforementioned actors try their best with what they're working with, and they succeed for the most part. Whereas Evans performance is above average, it lacks subtlety thanks to ham-fistedness and cliched screenwriting. Dances on the other hand, is the opposite. His presence onscreen, though outlandish and exaggerated, is not only intimidating and unsettling, but it has the calm, intellectual, and pitiful characteristics that should be, and was, the epitome of what modern vampires emanate(d) in widespread culture.

Its unfair to say that Dracula Untold didn't try hard enough, if at all. There was certainly effort and good intentions put forth, and while that is more than enough compared to recent alterations of the famed monster, it wouldve been a more worthwhile experience were it not for the rushed pacing and mediocre production values.",1415577600,13,2549,5.204878048780488

6503717,3,B00LSW76MO,"This movie is brimming with plot holes, with mediocre character development and somewhat awkward pacing. However, it does get the feel of a decent Gothic Action archetype quite well

The story originates from Vlad the Impaler. The exposition tells about how he would impale thousands of turkish soldiers who invaded on his home of Romania. However, now they are back in greater numbers and he is desperate to stop them. On his journeys, he finds the cave where an ancient beast lives that he narrowly escapes, a ""vampire"". He heads back to this cave to make a deal with the vampire to gain the vampire's powers.

After that, it all follows a somewhat predictable plot line, but it feels like every seem has a big plot hole in it. There are times when you might find yourself scratching your head at something that just seems to _happen_ without rhyme or reason. A lot of times, things will happen that seemed contrary to the plot leading up to it. Pretty much, you just have to ""accept"" a lot of things and take them for what they are.
The characters are fairly mediocre. Vlad is the only character with any level of complexity, and was actually played quite well.

The movie tries to get that gothic action type movie feel, like Underworld or Van Helsing. It is pretty successful in this regard, but tends to lean more towards the action side than the gothic side.

In summary, a fun watch if you're just looking for something entertaining",1414800000,7,1440,4.635294117647059
6503718,4,B00LSW76MO,"The first time I saw the trailer I simply said ''nope"". The second time I saw the trailer I said ""no still not gonna see this one."" It wasn't until one night watching a tv series I follow closely; the trailer for Dracula Untold showed once again, and after viewing it, I pondered that maybe Dracula Untold might actually turn out to be a decent movie. So finally, I decided oh what the heck, and today I got the opportunity to view the movie. And while I still had some doubt going in, my review of this movie will detail exactly why I feel the way I do about Dracula Untold.

Disputes have arisen between Vlad(our main character) and the Turkish armada. Not only are they a threat, but an order has been made that 1,000 boys must be offered to be trained for warfare. Consideration here quickly turns to desperation and soon Vlad comes across a mysterious man in a cave(who is not the nicest looking character in the world) who seems to have a solution to the problem: a sort of immortality. The price? Vlad must resist the urge for human blood in order to not become a full-fledged vampire.

Dracula Untold shines for many reasons. Luke Evans shows a lot of charisma and is definitely a stronghold throughout the movie. From his first appearance onscreen, all the way to his transition into the iconic character, he is a feat to watch. Sarah Gadon plays Mirena and does a good job; and I could definitely write a full review about how beautiful she is. Dominic Cooper portrays Mehmed in the movie, while he is not one of the movie's highlight performances I can call his performance satisfactory.

The effects/sound in the movie is also one of Dracula Untold strong suits', and the designs of the vampires are likable. Finally, the storyline this movie has is surely a good one. The suspense and the thrill of the first act, all the way to the cliffhanger ending of the final act keeps the movie viewer filled with intrigue, and in the end Dracula Untold is a movie I can definitely say GO SEE. And while I won't call Dracula Untold a 5 star movie I will rate it

It told the story of a man torn between love of his family and love and duty to his people and torn between terrible choices.  I eventually makes a terrible choice that could cost him everything but preserve his country and this tells a story of dracula filled with sacrifice and lose, but still retaining some of the classic horror element of being a vampire and just how badly it could all spin out of control.  I can't tell wether another would like this movies  But you should at least rent it online first to try it and if you like it buy it.  Some things I could compare the feel to is like a darker captain America if he was real ancient soldier with a kind of dark lord of the rings feel to it. I think there is potential for a sequel.

6503725,4,B00LSW76MO,"History is written by the victor - and in the classic stories, Dracula lost. The vampires lost, The vampire slayers and vampire enemies told the vampire story.

Here's how it might have been written by the son of the dragon himself. His kingdom, his family are beset by horrible enemies, outnumbered by thousands to one, with not an ally to be seen. The count's campaign to defend his people and family had its terrible moments, the ones convincing his foes to hold back for fear of, well, something. A battle averted is a battle won, isn't it, and those already dead after one fight won't be any more or less dead no matter how their remains are displayed.

But, no matter how terrible you want to be thought, someone more terrible will appear in reality. The prince's decision becomes to lose everything for himself alone, or to lose everything for his people and family. He chooses to become his kingdom's defender, as best he can, no matter the cost.

We've had some retellings of the classic vampire tale lately. The sparkly one (you know what I mean) launders the tale of sacrifice and loss, This dives headlong into it, and arises all the better for it.

6503727,3,B00LSW76MO,"Dracula Untold, starring Luke Evans as Vlad Tepes, is entertaining for the first 2/3rd of the movie. Obviously when dealing with a lead character that is a vampire, we have to suspend belief when it comes to the actual historical facts regarding the real Tepes and the conflict between Wallachia and the Turks. Our fictional Vlad is a loving and sensitive father, husband, and beloved prince forced to resort to extreme measures to protect his people.  In this case, risking his eternal soul for three days of vampiric power in an effort to crush the Turkish army.

Im willing to forgive the artificial three day timeline only because it does echo some of the Eastern European folklore surrounding vampires (the notion that a person killed by a vampire would rise as one themselves in three days). In this case, the Master Vampire (played by Charles Dance) provides Vlad with an out clause. If he can actually last three days without drinking human blood, he will return to his human state.

The movie does a good job in the beginning of building the mythos in a way reminiscent of the classic Dracula vampire movies and establishing the scope of Vlads newfound vampiric powers and weaknesses. This is what you might call a traditional depiction of the vampire: able to transform into bats, night vision, enhanced strength and speed, preternatural senses, weather control, vulnerability to silver and sunlight, repelled by crosses. It was actually a pleasure to revisit this classic vampire motif in an era of vegetarian vampires that sparkle in the sunlight.

The film is also beautiful to watch. Some of the most disconcerting scenes were not the overt displays of bloodletting, but the disjointed view of battle reflected through the mirror finish of a sword blade.  During battle scenes, they made great use of slow-motion and awkward camera angles to create an air of relentlessness as Vlad tears through opponents.

But as the movie spirals toward the forgone conclusion, we get tripped up time and time again on contrived scenarios and Vlad apparently forgetting his own powers.

Warning: Spoilers ahead.

Vlads mastery over bats is established early in the movie. He can not only transform himself into bats, but he can command any bats within the range of his power (which, based on the final mass combat with the Turkish army, must be all of Eastern Europe.) We see him use his bat horde to knock people off cliffs, run down soldiers, and create a GIANT BAT FIST OF DOOM to smash into the Turkish army and scatter hundreds of soldiers at a time. And yet when his wife is on the verge of falling off the tower, instead of just directing the bats to save her he instead flies up there himself. Vlad, pal, the bats were RIGHT THERE! You just smashed a thousand Turkish soldiers, in full armor, with them. They can totally handle carrying your waif of a wife to safety.

This happens again in the big showdown fight with the Sultan, who has prepared for Vlad by standing on a pile of silver coins and wields a silver-plated sword. Lets forget for a moment that at no time in the movie did the Turks actually learn of Vlads weakness, and that there is nothing in Arabic folklore that would lead the Sultan to know Vlad should be vulnerable to silver. Vlad, buddy. The guy is standing in the middle of a pile of silver no more than twenty foot diameter. Use the bats to knock him out of it! You used this technique to knock down dozens of armored Turks on horseback. Did you suddenly forget you have this power?

Back to Vlads wife. Of course, she plummets to her death just as the sun begins to rise at the end of the third night. Vlad is about to lose his powers, because he totally nailed that blood thirst and is about to become human again. But their son is still in danger and she is dying anyway. So she offers her blood to him so he can condemn himself for eternity in order to save their son.

So now Vlad is a vampire permanently and has even more power at his disposal. He can summon up a thunderstorm so powerful it blots out the sun (allowing him to conveniently pursue the Turks that kidnapped his son. And you know, Im totally ready to buy into that. They had set up the mythos early so that we should expect an exponential power increase between a temporary vampire and a true vampire. But Vlad doesnt immediately go after his son. First, he goes back into the monastery and turns all the survivors into vampires.

First, there was no reason for this. He didn't need their help to fight the Turks at this point. He is completely OP at this point and can solo this. Second, he also knows that he is about to condemn to hell all of the people he had sworn to protect. This is completely out of character with the man we spent the first 2/3rd of this movie with. Third, if all he had to do was feed the dying a little blood to turn them into vampires, why didn't he turn his wife? He didn't need to drain her dry to become a vampire. The rules set forth in the beginning made that clear. He could have taken a drink and then returned the favor to revive her.

So now Vlad and his vampire army slaughter the Turks and he saves his son. And, predictably, the vampires turn on our hero and are going to eat his kid. Vlad parts the thunderstorm and lets the sun shine down, killing all of the vampires and himself.

And if it had ended with that, I probably would have forgiven the other issues. It would have been the proper tragic ending that should follow these sort of things. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Regardless of the nobility of his reasons, becoming a vampire shouldnt have a happy ending.

But apparently the filmmaker felt otherwise and decides to shoehorn a happy ending into the movie. We cut to the future and see Vlad walking down the street, when he comes across a woman who just happens to look exactly like his long-dead wife. And oh, how cute, when he recites his wifes favorite poem to this total stranger, she stops and proclaims that is her favorite poem! Love transcends all as the pair walk away together. That feeling of nausea I got wasn't caused by the popcorn.

Ultimately, Dracula Untold is a movie diminished by a script that depends too much on contrivances and a hero who apparently has a terminal case of selective amnesia.",1413763200,10,6291,4.53927625772286

6503730,5,B00LSW76MO,"What a great Origin story for Dracula!  My favorite Dracula tale before this one would probably be the less well known Dracula the Dark Prince that is sometimes shown on Syfy, which blends the historical and hints at the monster.  But it's too historical.  Dracula Untold for me had the perfect balance of Supernatural, Love story, Origin story, historical fact, and action.  All of these element came together so well to tell a story I never lost interest in.  I was expecting this to go the Underworld route and have that bit of scifi cornyness with no lasting power (which I would have put up with for Luke Evans sake), but it definitely did not.  Sophisticated Dracula for the next generation and the perfect starting point for Universal to relaunch it's Monsters line up. Go support it in theaters!",1413590400,,803,4.741007194244604
6503731,5,B00LSW76MO,"Loved the idea of looking back and glimpsing a version of what could have been pre-vampiric Dracula. I speculated that this movie, given the backstory premise, would not infringe upon or conflict with my long held Dracula favorites from a story perspective, and it absolutely did not. Dracula Untold managed to take what is already a fairly tragic figure and made the Dracula story even more tragic. So, this is a wonderful addition to the saga. Additionally, Luke Evans' portrayal was so amazingly warm and endearing that any of Vlad's brutality only added to the personal tragedy of the character. One bitter-sweet result from this movie - where I thought that I was safe in watching Dracula Untold as it would not conflict with old Dracula standards, I now find that I have a new favorite portrayal of Dracula on my hands; and, I cannot wait for what will surely be an incredible upcoming sequel(s).",1413590400,2,902,4.825806451612904
6503732,4,B00LSW76MO,"Dracula Untold plays out similarly to Disney's Maleficent, where it isn't necessarily a remake or reboot, but a retelling, a 'what if this was actually how it happened'-style movie. The film follows Vlad the Impaler as he looks over Transylvania as Prince. But when the Turkish Sultan Mehmed II comes calling for a thousand boys from Vlad's kingdom, he decides the only thing he can do is confront the demonic force that lay within Broken Tooth mountain, where Vlad previously encountered the creature. Bestowed the unholy gifts of being a vampire, Vlad has three days to protect his kingdom, his family, and fend off the Sultan. But if he is to give into the thirst within those three days, he will remain this beast for eternity. Fighting the thirst, the Sultan's army and his own psyche, Vlad, a man of death who wanted to become a man of peace returns to his old ways in order to save those he cares for. But at what cost?

Dracula Untold is good filmmaking and story-telling, giving us a romantic tale mixed with themes of redemption, vengeance, courage, but most importantly, fear. Many people have criticized the depiction of Dracula, but again, this is a retelling. You can't think of Dracula the same way as you did in the Bela Lugosi '31 film or in Bram Stoker's Dracula in '92; this is a different monster, yet familiar. Luke Evans' performance, though, was without a doubt award-worthy and heart-wrenching; the man needs leading roles, because his talent cannot be contained. The supporting cast was good, but no one in particular stood out more-so than others. The visual effects, for the most part, were astounding but some scenes did need a little more work. The musical score from Ramin Djawadi was superbly dark and hauntingly epic, as if channeling his work on Game of Thrones into a more ""Lord of the Rings"" style score, with epic choral vocals and orchestral melodies. Gary Shore's direction was great, definitely in helping create the dark, grim and violent world of Dracula Untold. The script was good in that there was nothing cheesy about it, but there were many plot holes; the film should have been at least twenty minutes longer to add to the thin back-story.

Overall, Dracula Untold is a valiant and good effort, but falls short of being the vampire epic we deserve. But, the film is saved greatly, due in no small part to Luke Evans' acting, the visuals and the storytelling.

In short, The ticket was worth every penny I've paid.

I'm familiarized with Dracula movies and novels and I had thought that no movie might beat 1992 Bram Stoker's Dracula, but this one, with all of its dark elements did the job.

Maybe I liked it big time because it felt like a 92 minute rock music video (which I like).
The story line was smooth and fast, the acting was brilliant, the visual effects were excellent, the surprising and thrilling shots were the best and Luke Evans of course was wonderful with deep eye looks telling so much.

Features great music and a great performance by Evans, but CHARLES DANCE as the Master Vampire was awesome. There is a famous video game series called Castlevania. Someone in production must be a fan of the Castlevania games (especially the Lords of Shadows series) and the film benefits from those aspects. Fans of the game will know immediately what I mean.
It is completely different from other Dracula films, that is where its beauty lies. It would have been awesome to see Baba Yaga ( a witch who also appears in Castlevania), but those scenes were removed. The critics bashed it and it may not be doing great at the box office, but it is one of the best movies about the character that I've ever seen.
