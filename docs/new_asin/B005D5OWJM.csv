4657149,5,B005D5OWJM,It's much different than a American documentary. There is not the chest thumping and the statisitics. This is mostly combat footage. The best I have ever seen. The cameramen were right there at the front. Some of them were killed during filming. The documentary shows the horrors of war very closely. One thing that was very obvious to me. The bravery of the Soviet soldiers. You can tell they were very willing to die for their cause. If you are looking for detailed facts and statistics you will be disappointed. If you are looking for some insight on being in a combat zone. This is perfect for you. It's almost like you are there with the Soviets.,1337644800,26,651,4.572649572649572

8466309,5,B005D5OWJM,"Like good cinematography? Like good war film footage? Like good documentary making? Of those three, one speaks to you than this film is for you. And if either two or three of those questions speak to you then for sure this film is for you. Russian war film reporters demonstrate a brilliant sense at making films where the film reporters of the West demonstrate a near dullness of sense in contrast. Corps of cameramen had to have been organized in strict operating units commanded by a lead film reporter. With each league of recruits comes an accompanying cameraman to capture on film the lethal events it took to devast death and that is what the Nazis were: the stormtroopers of death. This film conveys that message concisely both in narration and in visual images, ever dynamic due to thoughtful editing. Portrayed visually are decimated skeletal remains of cities left in the wake of death's stormtroopers, the legacy of the Nazis: gutted Russian cities -- crumbling brick walls, heaping mounds of random rubble, the very landscape of death. Russian ability to mass produce weaponry was an overwhelming factor smothering Nazi ability to respond with greater or equal military might. Death's Stormtroopers fought ferociously at times, many fighting to the death. Never was there enough Nazi personal to match Russsian. Never was there adequate military supplies, lines of supply trucks too stretched out, inadequate railroad lines, the land of Russia itself an added enemy but that is not a topic this film conveys, Most of the scenes are of the Soviet soldiers, tanks, cannons, rockets combining cinematically to portray the created hell necessary to bring death to death itself. This is a film about war told simply and graphically while conveying a sense of the Russian common folks and their relations to the land of Mother Russia and it was them who are the heroes of the war.",1444780800,3,1887,4.974683544303797

8466313,4,B005D5OWJM,"Review by my WWII documentary loving husband.

Produced by the Soviet Central Film Bureau in 1943 the Battle of Oral is pure Soviet Propaganda at its finest.

However, if one overlooks the obvious references to Soviet Motherland, and the German Vermin, its actually a pretty good documentary of what is commonly known as the Battle of Kursk and the Russian counter offense that ensued immediately after the Germans failure to conduct a pincer maneuver.

The film contains large amounts of footage that I personally have never seen before, and actually has quite a large amount of on-scene battle footage.  I wouldnt be surprised if one or two of the camera men got blown up while filming this project.

For both its cinematography and its unique battle footage, the battle of Orel is definitely worth a look.  The film is audio dubbed in English, and has English subtitles.",1410480000,9,873,4.904761904761905
8466314,4,B005D5OWJM,"Good documentary stuff, not great, the actual battle scenes are over quickly. There's a fairly long part about liberating Orel and funerals for the fallen Russian soldiers. I was hoping for some footage from the big tank battle, but not much of that. Mostly T-34's rolling by dead German tanks or through liberated villages and fields. Perhaps the cameramen weren't in the thick of it, or perhaps the fighting was so spread out that they couldn't catch much of it. We need to invent a time machine to look back at these battles.",1407110400,8,528,4.688172043010753
8466315,5,B005D5OWJM,"Soviet-produced, 100% Soviet and German combat footage. Well-narrated in English, with English subtitles where needed.

If you want to see what it was really like on the Eastern Front, this is it.

Lots of tank action of Soviet tanks. Many shots of German tanks but mostly when they're blown-up (understandably).",1402185600,2,312,5.22
8466316,2,B005D5OWJM,"For the greatest tank battle, there is not a single scene showing more than 5 tanks on both sides at one time. You will get more information by buying a book to read about Kursk.",1394841600,,178,4.114285714285714
