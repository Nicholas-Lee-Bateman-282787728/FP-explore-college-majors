5405912,3,B00AADADA4,"I bought this from Walmart. I like Danny Trejo so I decided to try this one. The acting was pretty bad, but the storyline was ok. It was consistently moving along, very few ""dead"" spots. It was easy to predict each outcome,but one I didn't expect. I wish it had ended better, it was left hanging in my opinion. One scene was just wrong and I didn't like it at all. They should have left that one out. Gore factor not so much, except for that one scene. I can't say I was disappointed. It wasn't as bad as some I've seen, but it was worse than others. I would say go ahead and watch it, what the heck. If you are a horror fan, add it to your list.",1362960000,,646,3.976923076923077

Do not buy it JUST due to Trejo being in it, his role is very limited in the later part of the film.  Typical over CGI uses but still worked well and you know this is a B-film type (not a slam, many best films that exist were not A-listed films) so there will be CGI to aid the budget constraints...if you cannot find it locally for say $10, or find it to rent, then I would not let the $12 price tag scare you off.

  These zombies can run, swim and scale buildings

were very well done. The shoot-outs are intense because
everyone is shooting unlimited ammo and not changing

5405917,4,B00AADADA4,"A group of survivors hide on Alcatraz Island(yes, that Alcatraz Island) to escape from rising zombie hordes. When their refuge is overrun, and hearing that a scientist has discovered a cure, they leave the island to seek him out.

This has to be one of the better zombie movies that has come from The Asylum, as of late. Of course, with its' accomplished cast, that's to be expected. However, I was rather disappointed with everyones' acting performances. It seemed to me that most of the cast dialed in their performances, there just wasn't much passion in their performances at all. Still, it's not enough to spoil the whole movie. There's plenty of zombie action, an interesting storyline that would-indeed-rival one on The Walking Dead, and even a little humor thrown in..if you look for it(you'll know what I mean, when you see it).

This is a keeper for the Zombie fan...if not, for anything else, seeing(Spoiler)Danny Trejo turning into a flesh-eater. I enjoyed it and applaud The Asylum. These guys and gals are, actually, putting out better and better original movies. <Thumbs up>",1361145600,,1089,4.945355191256831
5405918,4,B00AADADA4,"I didn't realize this was an Asylum production until after I purchased it. That said, I was not disappointed. The action takes place San Francisco. It is implied that due to government cutbacks (blame the Tea Party first crowd) the water supply got infected which lead to the zombie outbreak. There is a group doing research on Alcatraz headed by Dr. Lynn Snyder (Mariel Hemingway). There is another guy trying to develop a vaccine at Berkley who makes regular transmissions. When zombies start floating up at Alcatraz, that forces the two groups to come together.

I like the zombie effects. We had the split in half crawling zombie; the limb out of joint zombie; a suicide zombie; a new born baby zombie; and an amputation to prevent infection. Being California, long handled tasers and not AR-15s are the weapons of choice versus zombies. There is a an over abundance of zombie action. In one weird unconvincing scene Hemingway pulls a knife on Trejo who then looked scared. The dialouge needed some improvement, but considering it was Asylum, I can't complain. The really bad special effect was the new born baby, which was obviously a doll from behind, and a several months old live baby from the front. It gave me a chuckle. Trejo's appearance is slightly more than a cameo.

Also known as ""Dead Walking"" this appears to be the opening of a series like ""Walking Dead.""

Parental Guide: TV-14. No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Plenty of zombie violence.",1361059200,3,1453,4.827309236947791
5405919,3,B00AADADA4,"I'll be honest, the only reason I bought this was because it was at a very cheap price, seemed to star Danny Trejo (who I've loved in past films like Machete), and I was in the mood for a zombie gorefest. Only one of these reasons actually turned out valid... it WAS budget priced, but really only worth about half of what I paid.
ROTZ stars a D-list cast led by Mariel Hemingway, who obviously is officially (judging by her choice to be even be in this film as well as her substandard performance) no longer any sort of staple in Hollywood at all anymore. Her small band of zombie apocolypse survivors are introduced to us in their island prison hideout which right off the bat, is being overrun by zombies (cast includes Danny Trejo, perhaps the biggest name in the film, the ADHD skinny nerd from the original Fast and the Furious, the Reading Rainbow black guy, and the fat dude from both the Boy Meets World sitcom and American History X, among other no names). As is typical in these sort of zombie films where there is NO introduction to zombies, we simply are thrust right in the middle of the action long after the apocolpyse already happened, so there really is no ""rise"" of them because they obviously have won already, and have overrun the planet. So what is a small band of people to do? Well, they've been researching a cure for a long time now, led by their scientist played by LeVar Burton (yes the Reading Rainbow guy... who also by starring in this film is just looking for a paycheck). Since they have not made much progress and realized their prison island has become vulnerable (as zombies can apparently now swim... yea, lol exactly), the group decides to take a raft out to the city and try to find yet another scientist who has been working on a cure for a long time as well.

Throughout this we get various scenes of zombie gun toting action - none of which are all too interesting or even interestingly violent or gory. If you've watched zombie movies before, you've seen this type of violence; shootings to the head, various blood splatters here and there, etc. It's nothing groundbreaking in the least bit and you've seen it done MUCH better in actual real zombie movies, such as the George Romero classics or even the 28 Days Later films. So various relationship issues ensue, which is very cliche at this point in the zombie genre. For example, a person gets bit, another person they love has trouble shooting them since they'll now turn into a zombie, you know where this goes. One by one some people die simply to circumstances throughout the movie until we're left with our usual smaller group of survivors.
In the end, it's all really by the book, all sort of typical zombie textbook stuff. The ONLY scene that makes a desperate effort to redeem itself from this textbook script is where things take a more extreme, if far-fetchidly cheesy, turn. When they encounter a pregnant survivor we meet early in the film during a short stint. She accidentally gets bit and since she's pregnant, of course the gal played by Hemingway has trouble shooting her (since she's pregnant, it you know, makes it harder to kill her); yet in comes her friend who quickly does it. Mariel then takes her knife and opens her up and plops out the newborn baby, very quickly, in a scene that's both hilarious and disturbing, and perhaps the silliest scene in cinematic history. Of course they didn't get the baby out in time so the baby turns and they quickly kill it. The scene is in there for no other reason than to have an extreme scene, but it's just tacked on and an obvious attempt to get a buzz going. Anyway, once it's done, on to the next scene.
One other thing that's important enough to be addressed, probably the biggest flaw I see in this film has got to be the fact that the zombies themselves aren't really all that interesting. They don't take the starring role, which is what people want to see from zombie films; they feel more like cardboard caricature cutouts to order to keep the plot moving. Would have been nice to see them have more ""personality"" than they do, but instead they just moan and run after victims and eat when they can. It's pretty flat and disappointing. Another notable flaw is Danny Trejo's overall screen time in the film, which I can only describe as ""false advertising"" to not give anything away (not that it really matters).

So thus far you're probably wondering why I gave this 3 stars instead of one. Well, because overall the movie as a whole isn't that bad. It starts out with the usual textbook zombie stuff, but then as the cast diminishes the plot actully seems to get BETTER and more interesting. Things slow down, actual characterization develops, the fat is cut out, camera work and cinematography improves, etc. While it never reaches anywhere near Oscar-worthy material, you begin to actually enjoy this film more than you may have originally anticipated. The biggest positive I felt while watching this film is that throughout the entire runtime, the film never stops taking itself seriously. Yea, that's right, it does take itself seriously, and does geniunely try to be a good movie, and I give it kudos for that. It's not a tongue-in-cheek type film, or a parody of itself, or something that tries to poke fun, and knows that it isn't the best movie in the world, but it does try, and I appreciated that, because the filmmakers did give it their best shot to entertain and enthrall you, besides their limited budget, and not-so-stellar cast they could probably only afford, or limited script-writing time or other constraints. Characters are not given the best dialogue, but they do try (most times, other times you can tell it's just spouted out to get to the next scene asap), and they are taking their situation seriously. Not only that, but every time the survivors reach a new area, there are more zombies to contend with. You begin to see their exhaustion as times goes on, and actually begin to feel for them because they are constantly running and can't seem to catch even a moment's rest. Sure it could have all been done better, but in the end, you don't find yourself having wasted an hour and a half like you might have thought you would. Although some people might, I myself like to find value where I can if it's there even in the smallest amount.

So really I'd say this is worth a rental at best, avoidance at worst. I definitely would NOT recommend paying full price for this film as you'll probably only watch it once and most likely won't stand to watch it again. I for one have learned that these sort of low-budget made-for-tv or straight to video horror flicks aren't really worth the full price of admission and from now on will only stick with ones that have significant quality value.

In terms of package technicality, I'm disappointed that there are no setup options for language or subtitles, but the blu-ray looks good enough to be called blu-ray. Sound is ok enough, but I found the voices not well mixed enough, and action effects a bit too tinny, not as full as I'd like from an action film.",1360713600,8,7095,4.593059936908517
5405930,4,B00AADADA4,"Surprisingly good and all's I can say is I wasn't disappointed in the movie at all. Yes, it's running off of the same template as one of Asylum's movies, ""2012 Zombie Apocalypse"", the only difference is environment  and characters. It's got a pretty good cast too and I gotta say that I like this movie. This was also one of the stronger movies that came out that year for Asylum and as long as you have Danny Trejo rounding out the lineup (even though he dies in this flick, yeah, I know, what else is new right?) then hey, you've got yourself a pretty decent movie.

5405933,4,B00AADADA4,"Basically, this movie is a lot of zombie carnage and a few sentimental moments where characters wax woeful about how life was and who they've lost along the way...........yadda-yadda-yadda, who cares.  I just wanted a lot of zombie carnage and was not disappointed in that regard.  Unfortunately, they tried to insert some scientific mumbo jumbo now and again........now and again my eyes glazed over, bored with the scientific aspect that went nowhere and amounted to nothing in the scheme of things but it did allow LeVar Burton (as Dr. Dan Halpern) and French Stewart (as Dr. Arnold) to have far too many scenes which only served to distract and waste time.  When the zombies were marauding everything was fabulous, couldn't have asked for more.  On the other hand, I could have asked for a lot less where the living were concerned, because most of the actors failed to infuse their characters with any life whatsoever.  It's sad when the dead seem far more interesting than the living.

Otherwise, this is a fairly decent romp (and stomp) into the wonderful world of zombies.  It's a keeper!",1432252800,,1095,4.886486486486486
5405934,3,B00AADADA4,"The only thing that seems to ""rise"" in this movie is the living-dead body count -- not that it's necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, but it's often done in such an over-the-top fashion that it's mostly evidently contrived.

The acting is passable, with a few gut-tighteningly less than inspiring moments (standard fare for an ""Asylum"" production). And while the overall story is promising (though less than original), its story elements and general flow are frequently so implausible that it simply cannot be taken seriously as a complete whole.

This is not to say that ""Rise of the Zombies"" is an entirely avoidable release -- it is actually one of ""The Asylum's"" rare few ""decent"" entries (I restrain myself from actually labeling it ""good,"" which it actually COULD HAVE BEEN had it been handled a bit more intelligently).

To see so many ""named"" actors among the cast members (LeVar Burton, Mariel Hemmingway, and Danny Trejo) was quite impressive. (By the way, the common complaint about Mr. Trejo only having little more than a ""brief"" appearance in this production is such an overstretch of the imagination that I'm forced to recall that Drew Barrymore got WAY LESS screen time for her role in ""SCREAM"" but still managed to be perceived as being one of that movie's ""top billied"" actors, yet almost nobody raised such angry complaints in that instance and, in fact, the movie was almost universally ""praised"" for it -- so why is there such acrimony over Mr. Trejo's relatively small but still very significant role in this movie?)

My only real problems with this movie, out of everything else that requires a ""just accept it & go with it"" attitude to sit through it, are [1] some of the effects are just downright awful and facepalmingly fake (though the zombie make-up itself is often artfully and believably accomplished) and [2] there seems to be no real resolution at the end of the movie so that it feels as if there was a ""last page"" that was supposed to be read to help us make at least some sense of everything that had just transpired but which someone, as a prank or out of maliciousness, had just ripped out and left us all hanging & wanting.

It's entertaining enough to watch one time to get a sense of how ""The Asylum"" could ""hit and miss"" simultaneously and to prove that they are indeed *CAPABLE* of making good (or at least ""decent"") movies if they'd be more willing to up their bugdets just a bit and arrange to get better talent in the writing/producing/directing departments rather than splurging much of those resources on acquiring recognized names in the industry to push an interest in their product.",1422403200,,2638,4.763676148796499
5405935,2,B00AADADA4,"Rise of the Zombies(released Oct/12)stars,among others, Mariel Hemingway, LeVar Burton and  Danny Trejo,the hardest working Latino actor in the business. This is a low budget pic with some good acting talent on board. As with any movie,big budget or small,the writers and director always have a vision of some sort they want to impart to us. Unfortunately because of the massive number of zombie pictures over recent years it is hard for one to rise(no pun intended)above the other. This one is no exception. I can appreciate the effort but it does fall far short.
The story finds a group of folks hold up on Alcatraz island;the only time you might have people wanting to go there instead of the other way around. Burton is a scientist trying unsuccessfully to find a cure to their zombie infested world. Hemingway is also a doctor and she has just viewed a vid(seems the zombies have kept the communication lines up) from a doctor proclaiming he has a cure. He is situated at the Berkeley water treatment plant,a long way away.
After an attack of zombies who swim ashore,the general consensus seems to be to try and make it to Petaluma to an evac center there. Burton volunteers to stay behind to continue his research. As the group paddle towards the mainland they get attacked and they lose a couple of folks. Once on land they split into two groups with Trejo leading one and Hemingway the other. Trejo's group seemingly has the best shot at surviving but they eventually are dwindled down in numbers until only one gets to Petaluma. He finds there is nothing there. He tries to find and hook up with Hemingway's group,who also are constantly either dodging zombies or being attacked at every opportunity. Of course in the process the group is again slowly whittled down until there are about four left. When he finally reaches them their new destination becomes the treatment plant.
Along the way they lose another member,but they do reach the plant. Once they fight their way into it they reach the doctor who indeed has a cure. Before they escape one of the group is bitten on the hand and has his arm amputated to prevent the spread of the disease(they have only 30 seconds in which to do it).Unfortunately the only  way to escape alive is by a helicopter up above and the fellow now without his lower arm is the only pilot. Hemingway then becomes his left hand. The group indeed escapes,seeking a laboratory where the doctor hopes to produce multiple batches of his cure.
One can certainly see the low budget""slip"" showing throughout. The opening with the speeding group of folks going down a twisty section of San Franciscan road is not convincing at all. When the group first lands on the mainland from Alcatraz and gets attacked there is a brief shot of Hemingway with the water as a background. Unfortunately there are three heads of what appears to be either swimmers or surfers far behind her. On a budget like this it is hard to control your backgrounds. And at the end I couldn't understand why they had to chop the helicopter pilots arm off after he got bitten. Didn't the doctor there have a cure?
Throughout there are a LOT of scenes of blood and gore. The better ones don't over use this, but use them to their advantage and best effect at the appropriate moments. This is not one of the better ones.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1 :85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette and a gag reel.
All in all it was a nice try. It does have a decent cast but they can only do as best as they can with what they have....which wasn't a lot. As with others of the same quality they start relying,right from the get go in this one,on extreme blood and gore for shock value with no other real purpose other than to do just that. 2 - 2 1/2 stars.",1421798400,,3800,4.554093567251462

5405937,3,B00AADADA4,"I suppose Asylum was attempting to do a zombie movie right. This Walking Dead rip-off doesn't really satisfy. It's just a bland zombie entry with a decent B- cast (Randy from My Name is Earl, French Stewart, Mariel Hemmingway, Danny Trejo in more like a cameo, and Levar Burton), and it never really goes anywhere spectacular. The production values are somewhat decent, as are a majority of the special effects, in spite of several of the zombie scenes looking average and the extras were amateurish in their movements. The dialogue and script are the biggest problems, and drag the movie down in a big way, despite a short 90 minute running time..

5405942,3,B00AADADA4,"I am not really a zombie movie fan but this one was better than I expected and that was undoubtedly due to the talented (and for the most part until they turned into zombies) attractive cast.  But, after seeing a few zombie movies, the story always seems to be basically the same.  Zombies are caused by a pathogen of some sort, and everyone but a small group is infected, and someone is always trying to find a cure--which is what happened in the one a short time  back with a big ""Z"" in the name. The main characters are always running away and the zombies who are apparently as astute as a detective on a case, always manage to find them. I can understand the zombies all having rotting flesh, and there being lots of blood and gore, visible missing and strewn about body parts, lots of intestines showing and blood splattered on walls.  However, what I don't understand is that their teeth--and most teeth are pretty durable--instantly turn rotted and crooked after they become zombies. And, since this takes place in San Francisco, in the state of California, where blindingly white teeth and veneers are the norm, all zombies apparently instantaneously overcome these cosmetic issues and they all rot--natural or not.  Perhaps someone can enlighten me on the theory behind this point?  Even Vampires have better teeth than these poor slobs. My hairless dog even has better teeth and she started out missing a few from the time she was born and will never have a full set. Even in the most recent zombie movie I'd seen (had a big Z in the name) this happened.  However, I did get a kick out of the way they make the teeth look, because after they instantly go bad, they look like the teeth of a former relative of mine. What kind of surprised me was that the first 4 people you see who are trying to make it out of San Francisco to Alcatraz were not the main characters.  Only one of those 4 even meets up with the others. And the time they spent at Alcatraz isn't that long.  Also, Mariel Hemmingway was and always will be a class act.  Levar Burton was really adorable with those huge dark eyes as the one who stays behind at Alcatraz to find a cure, and French Stewart sort of played a character that was a cross between the nutty professor and the character he played on Third Rock From the sun although he's been very effective in the few dramatic roles I've seen him in.  Although I've always thought he was very cute, the male lead was the delightful young man who played ""Randy"" on ""My Name is Earl."" I couldn't seem to get past that, although he did a good job of acting.  Of course the delightfully macho Mr. Trejo did a great job as always. I just wish I could have had more time listening to his gravely voice and enjoying his physique (he was not dressed in a suit --yay!) and distinctive face. (Wonder what shampoo he uses--his hair is always shiny.) I also really liked the younger male lead who looked like a very young, thin, lighter-haired Sylvester Stallone. Mainly, this movie made me want to go to San Francisco and visit Alcatraz.  My favorite scene took place at the very beginning of the movie, which I believe was partially or totally animated.  It was when an SUV literally rolls down all the curves of the curvy part of Lombard, and this would have been rolling right past my ex-brother-in-law's apartment which looks out on that street.  Wonder if the filming kept him awake. This movie would.",1398211200,,3426,4.503225806451613

5405944,1,B00AADADA4,"Rise of the Zombies (Nick Lyon, 2012)

By the time the title card with The Asylum Presents came up five minutes into this movie, I already knew that its place at the very bottom of my 321-item Netflix Instant queue was well-deserved. I didn't realize it was going to get as much worse as it did, though, and by the time I was through I was sitting there slack-jawed trying to figure out (a) how casting director Gerald Webb (who would soon after cast the immortal Sharknado) managed to convince so many former A-list actors to appear in this piece of s*** and (b) how I managed to avoid stopping it halfway through. Rise of the Zombies runs eighty-nine minutes. It feels more like eighty-nine days.

If you can get through the movie's first scene, with a group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse fleeing through San Francisco to try and make it to Alcatrazone of the flat-out most ridiculous single scenes I have ever seen in a movieyou'll get to Alcatraz itself, where another small group is holed up trying to find a cure for the plague, led by Dr. Halpern (Star Trek: The Next Generation's LeVar Burton). After everyone in the compound makes a number of, shall we say, questionable choices (this is one of those movies where the plot is driven entirely by people doing stupid things), they...well, continue making stupid decisions. (Spoiler alert!)

I have seen hundreds of zombie movies over the years, and a lot of them have been some of the worst pieces of garbage to which I have exposed myself over the years. Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence. Zombie Apocalypse and its even worse sequel Redemption. Survival of the Dead, the Romero movie not even diehard fans will defend. Infested. Legion of the Dead. I haven't quite decided yetit would be pretty tough to be worse than Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Moviebut Rise of the Zombies may in fact be the worst of them I have ever seen. Not just because it's so irredeemably stupid, the effects are terrible, and (of course, it's an Asylum picture) everything about the movie that might once have been decent was ripped off shamelessly from another, much superior, movie. No, what really gets my goat about this one is that once again The Asylum managed to rope in people like Mariel Hemingway, LeVar Burton, and Danny Trejo in yet another cameo. There was enough talent here to create something halfway decent, which cannot be said of Zombie '90 or Zombies Ate My Neighbours. And everyone involved blew it.

5405946,4,B00AADADA4,"The Asylum. Love them or hate them, you have almost certainly encountered this studio's work at least once in the form of those knockoff scifi movies that are shoveled out in order to confuse gift-hunting oldsters. If you woke up Christmas morning to a stocking with Transmorphers in it when you asked for Transformers, you probably curse the Asylum's name, but if you love the scholck filmmaking of the 60s then the Asylum is one of the few studios carrying on the tradition of having a cast of nobodies run around outside scared of something silly.

Except in this case.

The first thing you will notice about Rise is that there are many names in the cast that you will recognize. Most Asylum films contain one washed up famous actor, but Rise contains Levar Burton, Danny Trejo, Mariel Hemmingway, and Ethan Suplee! Some of those people have careers still! You will be further shocked to see that it is not a conspicuous ripoff of any particular film or television series; while it's initial title of The Dead Walk suggests a halfhearted mockbusting of The Walking Dead, this movie is also a Syfy original and as such had its name changed for TV. The end result is a zombie film that is more or less original, albeit slavishly adherent to all the tropes of Zombie cinema.

The third thing you will notice is that the folks at the Asylum seem to want to break from their TV-friendly roots with this one. For those not in the know, the Asylum started life as a film-making branch of Blockbuster video, and as such their films have always been pretty PG-13 (even when they get an R). This movie, however, gleefully rains bloodshed and body horror upon the viewer as zombies are shot, non-zombies are mauled, and horrible stuff of every stripe happens. In one particularly upsetting scene, Levar Burton (who plays the requisite ""scientist who wants to cure the zombies"" character) cuts a slice out of his own arm in order to feed fresh human flesh to his zombie daughter. This pales next to another scene in which Mariel Hemmingway cuts the baby out of a dead, infected, pregnant woman (who Ethan Suplee has just shot) and hands it off to Heather Hemmens' character who watches in horror as the baby turns as well, then stomps it to death (then reveals she is also pregnant, then self-immolates in a trolly car). This scene is unrelentingly grim and is what most reviewers are talking about when they mention ""one scene that turned me off.""

Sadly, while every stop has been pulled out for this film, it suffers from the two archenemies of cheapo film-making: writing and effects. The script is forgettable and the cuts are jumpy, and the ruination a zombie plague has brought on San Fransisco is hard to believe when speeding traffic is not removed from most of the long shots. The makeup for the zombies is good enough, but other effects such as electricity and fire just sort of suck. Nonetheless, this movie represents a bold step forward for the Asylum, into a world where horror movies can be R-rated and films don't have to be ripoffs.

Of interest to some is that DTV action/horror films inevitably put the heroes at the helm of a huge truck of some sort, as big trucks are cheap and lend themselves to action. This film features two big action trucks, some flavor of Chevy (I think it's a Tahoe or a Suburban) and later an oldschool Toyota Tacoma. Also Ethan Suplee flies a helicopter because it turns out Randy is actually kind of a badass.",1379980800,2,3449,4.638297872340425

5405973,3,B00AADADA4,"RISE OF THE ZOMBIES

I have to say that I really do love The Asylum; I can't help it I am a sucker for these no/low budget movies they churn out. That of course includes the mock busters they constantly produce. In fact I watch more of these kinds of movies than the ones with actual budgets and hit theaters. This film is director Nick Lyon's [Species - The Awakening] second zombie flick for The Asylum with the first being ""2012 Zombie Apocalypse"". I really didn't that hate that movie and in fact liked it so I went into this one looking for it to be about the same. Still not sure if it is at the same level or not. Something's are better but others are not.

The film follows a group of people who have survived thus far from the zombie apocalypse. They have done so by hiding out at the infamous Alcatraz Prison. It makes sense since it can be a good secure place and is also obviously surrounded by water. Well the day comes when the island is overtaken by the zombies as they just walk under water to get there. So with the place being overrun and with hope that a scientist who makes videos has discovered a cure they decide to head out to find him.

Story wise over all this is not a bad movie even though this kind of thing has been done before. There is always the guy who may be able to cure something in these kinds of movies so people search them out and look for sanctuary. Not anything new but these types of flicks always interest me. Also there are some cool looking zombies in this movie, don't get me wrong there are some bad looking ones but there are some cool ones. Also anyone who likes blood and such in their flick will like that aspect of this flick. With any zombie movie there has to be the gore and this flick is no exception.

Now like any Asylum movie there are some horrible CGI moments to be had here, in particular the car crash stuff at the beginning. It is really bad, laughingly bad so I guess that is a good thing. Also I must say that the beginning of this leads you to believe that someone else will be the star of this, well that is not meant to be, you'll see. Acting wise this movie ranges from bad to very good depending on the actor that is on screen. Danny Trejo is here and as always is good for the time is on screen. Same can be said for French Stewart who may be the here. There are plenty on actors you would not suspect would be in an Asylum movie like Ethan Suplee to mention at least one. But the movie stars Mariel Hemingway who is good in the role but the character is annoying.

This movie was written by newcomer Delondra Williams and Keith Allan who wrote and directed The Asylum's 11/11/11, not sure why I felt the need to let you know that. Any way this is a good enough zombie flick especially for The Asylum. I would say if you are a zombie movie fanatic then check this out. To anyone else, you can probably skip it if you didn't like the previous zombie flick from this director and company.",1368489600,,2959,4.184210526315789
5405974,5,B00AADADA4,"Exceeded all expectations and then some, huge both a huge Danny Trejo & Zombie movie fan this movie was one I was looking forward to watching.",1366761600,3,142,4.5
5405975,3,B00AADADA4,"This movie was okay. It's better than most zombies movies, but not as good as good A movies. This is still a B movie overall, so it is not a best seller. It's just another zombie movie that is good in terms of zombies movies, but isn't memorable or award winning. Hope that makes sense.

If you look at the cover, you would think that Danny Trejo was on a one man mission to stop the zombies in this movie. Also makes you believe, he is the hero of the movie. Too bad that's not true. I don't know who did this cover, but Danny isn't going to be in the movie long. As many people have said, he is in the movie, but he's not the hero or there long - it's almost like he did a cameo for this movie. Then, after he's gone, the movie will continue on without him perfectly. So, let's say he more of a supporting character in this movie than the hero.

As for the story, I would say it's pretty good. It has your basic characters trying to find a cure and to find a way to escape from the zombies. The acting is okay. It's not over the top, but not as bad as many other zombies movies. I would go as far to say it was great! The endding was bad and a typical endding for these zombies movies.

I would recommend this movie because it's one of the better B rated zombie movies out there.",1365292800,11,1281,3.99609375

Well, pretty much everything. This is one of those terrible Asylum movies. Y'know the studio that loves to make $5 knock off of actual ""good"" movies.

Basically, it's just another zombie flick that goes nowhere.

Terrible acting, terrible special effects, terrible lighting, plot, script, dialogue, etc. Too much CGI (fake smoke from engines, CGI fog, a bunch of other stuff).

I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I just couldn't. Couldn't do it. In the end it amounts to nothing. A bunch of people running around, unlimited ammo, sub-plots that go nowhere (Electricity scares the microbes that zombify you? Great! Is it a cure? Uhh, well, no...

5405978,3,B00AADADA4,"Maybe it is the fact that I haven't seen a good zombie movie in a few months and really just needed a little zombie movie fix, but I didn't think Rise was too bad... it wasn't top shelf zombie movie greatness but it was miles above better than the Sci Fi channel's previous movie, 2012 Zombie Apocalypse.  (But I didn't think it was as good as Chiller Channel's Steve Nile's Remains!)  The acting was not as bad as I was expecting... in fact, I think it was pretty decent from most of the seasoned actors ... what I thought could have used a little work was the script ...and thinking the story out a little more, which might have fleshed out the characters a bit too. We are given a look into a character's journal but why, cause the revelation added nothing to the character. One character decides to separate from her beau to go into the zombie infested city to search for a cure but then looses her bravery and lust for life and love near the end! Senior ""Bad Ass"", who I was expecting to survive to the very end, gets overtaken by a yoga / ""The Grudge"" looking zombie! And oh my gosh, you would think that by now folks would realize that noise attracts zombies... there seems to be a lot of just standing around making noise and then watching as zombies surround the survivors!  There are a few slow bits (standing around as masses of zombies close in on them!) and a ton of over the top stupid bits that really didn't need to be in the movie, but added to the gore! ... Golden gate bridge baby delivery and Lamar Burton's character becomes mad scientist ... (surely even the dullest survivor realizes that it is flesh that the infected crave, hence all the munching they do on the living! But no, Professor Lamar didn`t know it until he got a boo boo)! And what I don't understand... if you got the cure... then why are you chopping off the arm of one guy and just giving another person a shot?  I just wish the writers had been a little more interested in writing a great zombie movie instead of seeing how much gore they could pack into the movie.
Make up / zombies were pretty durn good looking! And these zombies are much like the ones in the remake of Day of The Dead... they are runners and great climbers... and I do believe a lot smarter than our group of survivors! I too think this might be one to save your money on and just wait and catch a rerun if you have nothing better to do!

8549147,3,B00AADADA4,"Rise of the Zombies was made for Syfy by The Asylum, which should be enough to bring groans from those who know. At the very least it means it couldn't possibly be really good and there are good chances it will be awful. I'm less inclined to hate The Asylum than some people: You have to take into account that though we all tend to think of movies as an art, their real reason for production is as a business deal to make money. The Asylum is simply a low budget production company that makes product for the direct-to video market and lower end cable channels. They have enough technical proficiency that you feel you are seeing a made for TV movie and not something shot with a teenager's iPhone. Not much more than that, but in the world of zombie movies that's at least saying something. They have done Sharknado for Syfy as well as Z-Nation, which gives them some knowledge of the zombie genre. They seem to like gimmick casting; one zombie film was cast with members of former boy bands and this brings back Mariel Hemingway a long way from Woody Allen's Manhattan.

The cast is actually pretty good, full of people who have done credible television and film work, including Ethan Saplee and Le Var Barton. The problem is that the script is really bad and though they try, they simply can't do much with it. Then there's Danny Trejo, whose face dominates the cover. Trejo, a former San Quentin inmate, was discovered on the set of Runaway Train in 1985 and because of his authentically rough looks found a niche in action films and over the years developed an enthusiastic and loyal fan base. At some point production companies noticed that his presence guaranteed a certain amount of interest and sales and so they began including him just so they could put his face on the cover. This has led to a new career for the over-70 year old Trejo. For at least the last five years he's been appearing in twenty films a year. Appearing has to be taken lightly. Often these are very small parts, or parts where he dies early on. I saw one zombie movie where the zombies were lava-filled zombied spewed out by a volcano and Trejo was only in some almost unrelated connecting scenes where he is an old Indian telling the ancient legend of the volcano. Of course these bit scenes undercut the dependability of his presence guaranteeing a good film; in fact it's more like the bigger his face is on the cover, the worse the film is. But at his age he should care? It's a paycheck. He's actually in this film for a decent amount of time.

it's the typical zombie apocalypse, this time set in San Francisco. A group of soldiers and scientists are safe on Alcatraz until zombies are carried there by water (or learned to swim - it isn't clear). Then they have to run and the usual complications result. The zombies were caused by a virus but apparently the virus kills them and then they become true ""Living Dead"" and require headshots to be dispatched. The people here are really dumb even for a zombie movie. Driving fast to escape the zombies, the first group decides to take Lombard Street (""the crookedest street in the world""). Every decision made by various members is like that so you can have no sympathy for them. The film also includes a zombie movie cliche so overused and lame that it really needs to be dropped altogether. I won't give it away but you'll know it when you see it.

On the plus side the zombies are fairly good, though sometimes they are fast and sometimes slow. For those who like an anything goes feeling about who gets killed, no one seems to be out of danger. This is especially true in the early part of the film when characters who you think are going to be major are killed off left and right. There are also some fairly gory segments for those who count that as a plus. It moves along fairly quickly but the plot is so aimless it doesn't feel like it went anywhere. The major special effects (explosions, fires, vehicle crashes) use the same computer effects teenagers use when making zombie ans apocalyptic shorts for YouTube, so try not to laugh.

With lowered expectations, it's a basic zombie movie that at least doesn't try to be a comedy or satire, and though it seems unbelievable I seem to be running out of zombie movies. So if you just want a basic zombie fix, Rise of the Zombies is okay, but just okay.",1493164800,2,4344,4.4879898862199745
