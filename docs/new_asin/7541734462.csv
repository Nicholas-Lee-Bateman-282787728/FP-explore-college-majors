Am I the only Jamie Oliver fan in US/Canada?  I imagine there are many more than me. Don't you?",1371168000,13,250,3.8076923076923075
7900887,4,7541734462,"I love Jamie at Home. Been watching episodes for quite awhile. The food is rustic and pretty and looks delicious. The tramping through the garden and woods, etc. bit is really charming and quite informative. Absolutely love the series.
Important to note: this dvd cannot be played in most U.S. dvd players. It says that in the item description... Mine played fine on the computer, and we were even able to watch on t.v. by using an hdmi cable linked from computer to t.v...
Also, even though the title does say ""complete"" (even on the front of the dvd case), there are, in fact, many more episodes. Most likely, this was the complete series early in the show's existence... but they've clearly had more since.
Episodes include: tomatoes, courgettes, barbecue, beans, onions, carrots & beets, potatoes, peppers & chillies, mushrooms (which they forage for!) feathered game (which he hunts for), pumpkin & squash, winter salad...
Missing is: lamb, furred game, winter veg, summer brassicas, summer salads, the one where he gets venison... etc...",1345161600,18,1043,5.034682080924855
