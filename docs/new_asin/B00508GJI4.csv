We start with a young secretary, Solidad (Angelica Maria) being dropped off by her boss., Alfredo (Manuel Saval).  We can tell by their conversation that they are married but he doesn't dare admit it to his sister Valeria (Lupita Ferrer) because he's partners with his brother-in-law. That nasty B-I-L bullies the young gal and tries to seduce her in his office. He knows his brother-in-law will soon return, so he grabs her and hauls her to his boat, where he intends to rape her on a nearby island.

One thing leads to another and nice Alfredo shoots his brother-in-law, but his wife takes the rap because of the damage it would cause to the family firm. Sweet Solidad goes to jail for 20 years where she soon gives birth to a baby girl; she never told her husband she was pregnant for fear that he would step up, admit his guilt and destroy the family firm.

She tearfully gives her baby Rosalinda, to her sister, who raises it with her daughters as her own. Twenty years later, Rosalinda is a lovely young woman who catches the eye of a pianist in a restaurant where she delivers flowers. He actually owns the restaurant but Fernando Jos Altamirano del Castillo (Fernando Carrillo) also works as a lawyer at the family firm. He sweeps her off her feet while she thinks he is a musician.

We soon discover that his mother, who is really his step-mother has always hated that scum who murdered her saintly husband 20 years earlier, never suspecting that he intended to rape the girl, or that her brother was the one who actually pulled the trigger.

We see all the standard telenovela plot lines: a kidnapped baby, amnesia, Who's your Mama? false pregnancies, many lies and some loveless marriages. Our lovers are thwarted over and over until they are pulled into a custody battle over their OWN little girl. Oh...and a happy ending!

This one is the victim of rapacious editing, so do NOT expect the quality or most of the episodes that were in the original novela. It's too bad, because in my opinion, this DVD could have used at least six more hours of action. Sorry.",1407542400,,2098,4.620967741935484
