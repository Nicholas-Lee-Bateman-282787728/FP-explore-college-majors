8526481,5,B008ACGLTE,"Yes yes yes! The first one is great and influenced a lot of 90's pop culture. This movie is a frenetic experience, part body horror dark comedy and stop motion that catapults you from beginning to end in a dizzying spectacle. The second film is meh, but a nice addition to the package at the very least.",1502323200,,303,4.333333333333333

Shin'ya Tsukamoto's decision to film in black and white was only one of many artistic choices culminating in a cult classic that still holds up over 25 years later. Unlike mediocre movies, it has the potential to haunt you a full two decades after watching it; you may not remember less important aspects such as plot, but you will certainly remember the transformation of Tetsuo. Long before Hollywood's Transformer or Iron Man flicks became mainstays at the multiplex, Tetsuo was both Iron Man and a Transformer.

Tetsuo would work well as a silent film but for the fact that the soundtrack and audio effects are part of what makes The Iron Man so stunning. This was created in the relatively early days of Industrial music (e.g., Einstrzende Neubauten), and while nothing special today, it was very memorable in 1990. One can imagine how painstaking it must have been to do all of the stop motion animation in this work of art; it's doubtful that directors / producers would put in this much work today, given CGI.

Beyond expectations, Body Hammer is a worthy sequel. Although I ordered this double feature Blu-ray from Amazon's UK site (since it cost about half the asking price on this site), it looks like prices here have dropped to below $20, which reasonable for a cult flick. Just be aware it's Region B: not the US standard for playback.",1443139200,3,1505,5.292887029288703
