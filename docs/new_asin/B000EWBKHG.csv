2541593,3,B000EWBKHG,"The movie starts off  a little hoaky with  predictible (almost laughable) music.  Clearly it's a movie made with a very low budget - however, once I got past that I found the movie to be disturbing.  I felt like I was in the room while these horrific acts were taking place.  I'm sure it was the way the camera focused (close up) on the faces of the victims &  the young BTK .  This brings me to the best part of the movie - the guy who played the young BTK Gerard Greisbaum.  I found myself feeling sick because he was so good in his portrayal of this disgusting human being.  And the slaughter house scenes were truly unbearable!  How is it possible to be so cruel?  These creatures feel pain just like we do so why are these horrible methods allowed?  The answer is easy - it's cheaper.  How sad is that?

In the end this low budget movie caused me to think about things that I normally wouldn't.  (And by the way I am seriously considering a new life as a vegeterian! )",1146614400,,973,4.183783783783784
2541594,4,B000EWBKHG,"Unlike the TV movie based on the Dennis Rader's killing spree, this DVD movie takes no time getting into the serial killer's head and we feel his insanity. The filmmakers tried to increase the horror of the situation with amazing ""peripheral"" slaughter footage. I've never seen anything quite so shocking as the rat scene. You will wonder how they got such a brutal movie past the censors. The opening nightmare sequence is worth the price of a rental!",1146614400,,452,4.8076923076923075
2541595,3,B000EWBKHG,"The ""young"" Dennis Rader character was developed with research from Robert Beattie's book.  The words from his letters to news & police stations were accurate. The budget was below ""ultra low"" so it made it difficult to respect the history of this terrible crime spree.  Production did their best to respect what happened.  The film is just a film that tries to show how putrid this man was.  Take the info with a grain.",1146441600,,420,4.635135135135135
2541596,1,B000EWBKHG,"When the movie says ""Based on actual events"" it means that loosely.  BTK killed his first victim in 1974, not the sixties.  He didn't have two sons but a son and a daughter.  He never had a ponytail.  He didn't kill his victims in the way the movie would have you believe.  The actual events were dramatic enough without some screenwriters turning history into a cheap B-movie.  If you are buying this movie expecting to see a documentary forget it, it's about as historical as a Troma movie.",1146441600,3,492,4.534090909090909
2541639,1,B000EWBKHG,THIS MOVIE WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SIT THROUGH. THAT IS WHY I HAVE IT LISTED FOR SALE.,1255564800,,87,4.176470588235294
2541640,1,B000EWBKHG,"um... was the lion let out of the gate on this one? some one hit the wrong button when green-lighting this film! That said, ZERO STARS. I'd rather pick at my nails or peel grass stems as thin as I possibly can for hours than watch this oddity again!",1247529600,,249,4.1020408163265305
2541641,1,B000EWBKHG,"I rented this from the video store, the cover looked very interesting,when i got home to watch it,the film looks like it was made with a 1985 home video camera its was not shot with movie film,I took it back to the video store and demanded a trade in.warning!!!! I would avoid this stinker.",1233792000,,290,4.388888888888889
2541642,4,B000EWBKHG,"BTK Killer is another true life horror film based loosely upon many of America's most notorius serial killers.  Shot on Digital Video and a cast of Lommel's usual players, BTK KIller is a gritty and twisted film about the maniac that
keep the American mid-west on edge for many years.  We go into the killer's mind and find out what makes him tick,  Don't listen to people who want to label this ""One of the worst movies ever"".  Please, there a lot of contenders out there.  The movie was professional lit and shot. Just don't expect a classical masterpiece.  It's a film that's made to shock and entertain.",1186272000,3,607,4.574074074074074
2541643,1,B000EWBKHG,"First of all, I live in Kansas where this all actually happened. I wasn't even born when the BTK killer was on his spree. Infact, I didn't know anything about him until he resurfaced in 2005 and was all over the news. My whole problem with this movie (besides it sucking), is that it wasn't factual. They didn't have time and dates right or even how many people he had killed. He started killing in 74' and his last was in 77' or 78' and he killed 2 men and 8 women. It was just lame overall and not accurate. I would give no stars but you can't do that so I gave it one.",1168300800,4,571,3.973913043478261
2541644,1,B000EWBKHG,"The only reason I don't rate this as a no star or even 1/2 star movie is because it isn't an option on Amazon. I bought this film while serving in Iraq, where the only thing we had to do much of the time was watch DVDs, and still didn't even finish the thing. Troops in combat zones will watch almost anything, no matter how B-level or low budget as long as there is a coherent plotline but this looks like someone spent about $500 bucks on everything including crappy camera equipment and actors and edited the movie (and I use that term loosely) on their pc before releasing it. My title stands, if you're thinking of buying this movie don't and if you bought it don't open it so that when you return it you can get your money back with no hassle.",1168128000,9,749,4.208333333333333
2541645,1,B000EWBKHG,"I recently deployed to Iraq.  I found this DVD in the nightstand of the rooms us military stay in.  Someone forgot or left it.  It didn't look very good to me, but I eventually ended up watching it.  I think I only watched the whole thing because I was in shock that something sucked as bad as this movie.

The movie opens with something that you won't want to watch, even if you like gore-porn.  The rest of the movie shows either BTK at home talking about nothing interesting with his wife, writing retarded poetry in junkyards, or some stupid journalist type stuff.

This is all presented with the worse editing ever... ever! The camera used to film this was obviously a JVC VHS comcorder manufactured in 1989.",1164844800,5,713,4.5234375
2541646,1,B000EWBKHG,"I think more money was invested in packaging than in any other part of this movie.  The camera had to be a piece of crap, the lighting was atrocious (shadows were everywhere...especially where they shouldnt be), and the script was probably written in under 2 hours.  And where did they get those terrible actors?  You could almost see them reading q-cards taped to the wall.  Ive seen better actors in local car dealership commercials.  And the constant footage of animal slaughter added nothing to the movie, except for making it impossible for your stomach to accept any type of snack while watching this lame excuse for a film.",1161993600,9,630,4.796296296296297
2541647,1,B000EWBKHG,"Save your money!  I have sat through some terrible movies, but this one takes the cake.  There is no plot.  It is a below-low budget movie that looks as if it was recorded on a cell phone.  The character on the movie basically repeats the exact same thing with three or four different victims, and the whole time we are subjected to slaughterhouse footage.  There is no way to really even know what is being done in the scene at hand.  Even the Henry movie, and Dahmer look like 5 star movies compared to this one.",1160870400,7,514,4.302083333333333
2541648,1,B000EWBKHG,"Someone please slap me because I BOUGHT this movie at my local grocery store thinking that it was going to be a documentary or something.  In reality, this was not even a B movie... is there such thing as an ""F"" movie.

I do not think real film was used to for this movie... just cheap Beta tapes and a video camera 1981.  Furthermore, the only accurate ""fact"" in this movie was the name of the killer.  Dear Ulli, BTK did NOT carry around a picnic basket full of scorpions, tarantulas and rats to the crime scenes.  And when the ""Nancy"" character said ""I know you... You're the dog catcher"" I thought I was about to fall off my seat.  Dear lord in heaven, please do not rent, buy, borrow or steal this pathetic movie.  The fact that it was completely inaccurate, looked like it had been filmed by a 12-year old and contained non-sensical, gratuitous violence should be reason enough to stay far, far, far away from this piece of crap.",1159833600,,935,4.401162790697675
2541659,1,B000EWBKHG,"i almost broke up with my girlfriend for picking out this movie at blockbuster. i cant even put into words how bad this movie was, i really wonder what the people who made this were thinking.",1158969600,4,191,4.333333333333333
2541660,1,B000EWBKHG,"It should have negative five stars.  Terrible script, terrible directing, terrible acting. It does look like amateur video, as another reviewer said.  Absolutely not worth your time as all it does is recreate the killer's crimes on videotape, complete with lame dialogue.  No police investigation, no analysis, just voyeurism -- like a 70's porn flick only with violence -- and the cherry on top is that footage of the crimes is interspersed with footage of animals being slaughtered.

Stay away.  Stay far away.",1158451200,5,512,5.120481927710843
2541661,1,B000EWBKHG,"I couldn't even finish this movie, it was just aweful, please avoid this.  I found myself skipping through the chapters waiting for things to happen...",1157760000,3,151,5.04
2541662,1,B000EWBKHG,"After seeing Lommel's ""Zodiac Killer"", which I actually thought was a pretty good film as long as you disregard the cheap looking picture quality, I didn't think ""BTK Killer"" would be as bad as most other reviewers said it was. Unfortunately, while ""Zodiac Killer"" had a plot, this ""BTK Killer"" does not. It consists of a number of bad murder scenes with lots of padding in between them.

Ulli Lommel has made some good films and some bad ones, so you never quite know what to expect. Take my word for it; this is not one of the good ones.",1149724800,5,539,4.39
2541663,1,B000EWBKHG,It is almost shocking to me how bad this movie was. You'll find it on the shelves next to horror classics and think that it is a genuine attempt at a horrifying thriller. Don't be fooled! The camera work looks exactly like what you would see at an amateur film festival. The movie itself feels.... fake. I don't doubt that 4 high school students with 50 bucks could go out and make a film of equal quality. The post-production work makes the movie a complete joke. Some of the scenes in the movie that should have been the most horrify look like they were made to be a music video. The movie will switch to unrelated pictures of a cow being butchered and it will replay the words of BTK 5 times. The acting leaves much to be desired.... but I don't think big named actors would even have been able to save this one. The bottom line is this: if you are looking for a definitive account of the BTK Killer read one of the many books on the topic such as Unholy Messenger. If you are looking for a DVD that will scare you while delving into the mind of deranged killers buy ED Gein or Silence of the Lambs.,1149120000,5,1102,4.202830188679245
2541664,1,B000EWBKHG,"What a piece of junk this movie is. The cover looks great, and on the cover it mentions the BTK Killer movie is from the director of Boogeyman. Cool, I thought, I wanna see this!

From the outset, I knew I had made a mistake. The acting was laughable, horrible really, worse than you would see at your local high school play, and I think the video camera they shot the film with can be bought here on Amazon for less than ten bucks in the ""children's toys"" section. Honestly. This movie is that horrible.

The story of BTK is truly interesting, but the director here tried to make it... ummmm... I have no clue what he was doing. Other than some quoting of actual BTK poems, one familiar with BTK would have no idea that this 'movie' is based on real events. It certainly does not portray the Dennis Rader (BTK's real life name) I have come to know.

I couldn't believe the average review is 2 stars. I am angry I had to give this movie a one star rating. The way I see it, I am now owed four stars, because I would honestly give BTK Killer a negative three stars on a one to five scale. To waste any time or money on this movie is to have a crime committed against you. I implore you, avoid this piece of garage at all costs. DO NOT BE SUCKERED in by the cover! This movie was junk junk junk! And did I mention how truly cruddy this movie is? I really need to mention that! It is bad bad bad bad bad. I am angry about how bad it is!",1148342400,7,1433,4.056537102473499
2541665,1,B000EWBKHG,"I rented this DVD because as others have said, the cover looks pretty decent, but that is the best you are getting from this DVD.... The Movie is the worst thing i've ever seen, Terrible Actors, Terrible Video Quality (it looks like an amateur home video), the only ""rescuable"" thing is the music, and it's only a so so thing. Dont buy this! Besides its expensive.. I would pay 1 dollar tops, and thats with shipping included.",1148256000,5,426,4.545454545454546
2541666,1,B000EWBKHG,"A movie's introduction is key to setting mood or introducing characters, environment, etc. Remember how in the beginning of Saving Private Ryan the introduction scene was so fast paced and helped set the tone for the rest of the movie? Well, in utter disappointment, the intro to this BTK Killer DVD belongs more in a 'Faces of Death' DVD than anything else. For some reason, this type of horror clips were also spliced with unrelated scenes throughout the movie. For example, why show clips of a cow dying when he's shoving a rat in this lady's mouth? I dunno. But seriously, I think a couple of buddies of mine with a cell phone camera and a porn style plot could have made a better film. Even the re-enacted scenes from TV's 'Unsolved Mysteries' seemed decades ahead in production quality. I would recommend watching paint dry at least that would cost less.",1147737600,3,860,4.701986754966887
2541667,1,B000EWBKHG,"I actually bought this movie b/c the package looked pretty good.  It looks like it was edited with two VCR's.  The movie did not make sense and the actors and actresses were horrible too.  I do not usually write reviews but this was the biggest waste of money.  So bad I did not even finish the movie.  Shame of it is I think the story should be told, but next time they make this movie I hope they have more than a $1,000 budget to spend.  Don't buy this!",1147305600,4,456,4.067415730337078
2541668,1,B000EWBKHG,"This movie is shot on video and looks like it.  Poor acting, shoty camera work and cheezy post production editing.  I would be shocked if there was actually a script for this movie.  Just montage after montage of Satanic rituals with victims, and cattle slaughter house scenes.  This movie is a total piece of garbage.  Was it shot by a high school kid with a trust fund?  Don't bother buying or renting this movie.  Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer is way better.",1147046400,2,466,4.542168674698795

8114816,1,B000EWBKHG,"I've seen thousands of movies but this film is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It's so low budget and povo that implying it was made my college drama students would be an injustice, more like high school kids. I've never seen a film so cheap with such bad acting and such a bad script. If that's not enough BTK Killer features scenes from abattoirs spliced throughout the movie for whatever reason (some scenes continually repeated) so if unlike me you get off on seeing animals being tortured and killed maybe this movie is for you.

Normally when I take a chance on DVD's (I bought this at a second-hand shop for $2) that I don't want in my collection I keep them in a box to trade in somewhere one day but this movie gets the distinction of being the only DVD I've ever bought that I thought so little of I actually threw it in my garbage bin as a community service to minimise it's circulation in society.",1394236800,,929,4.339080459770115
8114817,2,B000EWBKHG,"I didn't care for this movie, because it wasn't the original I watched on TV. I would not recommend this, and therefore I was disappointed in it..",1384732800,,146,4.444444444444445
8114818,1,B000EWBKHG,"You know, this director must be STOPPED!!! I do think that he personally gets off on animal cruelity and pain. A man like this must be very tortured and needs to see a therapist. He also directed another very cruel movie depicting animal cruelity also.",1324425600,,252,4.622222222222222
8114819,1,B000EWBKHG,"I cannot review it because I never even finished it! I hear Ulli Lommel use to make pretty good films. What happened? They replaced his brain with cocaine, heroin, crack, crystal meth and Everclear? This wasn't the first UL film I have laid my eye balls on. After watching at least 2 mins of the other ones, I went to get baptized by Jesus himself.",1311206400,,348,4.369230769230769
8114820,1,B000EWBKHG,"Ulle Lommell has never made a movie that didn't suck and with BTK KILLER his record stands intact. The story should be about how Dennis Rader, beginning in 1974 Bound, tortured and killed 10 women and stopped and resurfaced 30 years later. Instead Lommell is more interested in showing cows and pigs being slaughtered and those images are always super-imposed over the scenes of BTK torturing his victims. Those scenes are a bit creepy but I suspect that owes more to the director being a bit on the creepy side himself.

I won't even begin to knock the sub-par acting and shoddy production values(lighting, filming, settings, sound etal) because when you work on a Ulle Lommell film it's conceded as a given that you are the worst the industry has to offer.

To make the whole project even more reprehensible is the movie ends when BTK is captured and the results of the trial and aftermath is never shown.  I suspect Mr Lommell either ran out of stock footage of cows and pigs being slaughtered or he fell asleep. Good idea.  Next time you decide to make a film, Mr Lommell, take a nap instead.",1309651200,2,1096,4.605128205128205
8114821,1,B000EWBKHG,I wish I had seen some of these reviews before purchasing this DVD I could have saved myself some time and money. This has got to be without a doubt the biggest load of rubbish I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The acting was amateurish the storyline was uninspiring all in all this rates as one of the worst movies ever. I wish I could give this film zero stars but unfortunately this is not an option so I am stuck giving it 1 star which is way too generous. There is not much else to say except don't bother with this film it's not worth the effort.,1275091200,,563,4.127272727272727

This has to be the cheapest piece of crap I've ever had the displeasure of laying my eyes on.  And I dig movies about serial killers.  This one just sucks because it's possibly the lowest budget movie that's ever been filmed.  This movie literally looks like it was shot on a bad home video camera with cheap stock footage spliced in. The acting is beyond atrocious, and the script is something that could have come from the mind of a 3rd grader, to be generous.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!
