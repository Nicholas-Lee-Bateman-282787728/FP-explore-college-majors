8325007,1,B000CETB86,The worst video I've ever seen. A large part of the video is a camera on the floor filming puppies playing while people have an unrelated conversation in the background.,1490832000,,169,4.666666666666667
8325008,1,B000CETB86,"I can't believe Amazon would even allow something this bad be on their website. Wish I never rented it. Most of the video is the introduction, repeated several times. It's not even at the beginning of the video. Then you get to watch random video of puppies playing in a little room. Very little training/care instruction included. Terrible!",1423440000,,341,4.896551724137931
