8634783,2,B00HRFSYDQ,"This was formally released under the title ""Pimp Bullies"" and apparently didn't do that well.

Daniel (Adrian Bellani) appears to be a detective who has re-opened a cold case file. He is searching for the killer of Isabel (Catalina Rodriquez). He is seen interviewing the five leading suspects as they recall her life up to that fateful evening. This is followed by a stupid ending. The interviews are shown concurrently as subplots.

The film attempts to make a statement about women involved in prostitution and how bad it is for those who don't have the Internet to sell themselves. The poor acting, dialogue, and plot prevented any statement from coming through. Adrian Bellani was horrible.

This is a grindhouse without any of the killing and action scenes. It was boring in spite of all the naked strippers.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Catalina Rodriquez (?), Lizabeth Santos, Laura Garcia, plus others)",1398470400,2,920,5.072847682119205
8634784,5,B00HRFSYDQ,"I wanted to see this movie ever since I first saw the trailer on Facebook. I am not disappointed, this is an awesome movie. Adrian Bellani's character is awesome, he executes the role perfectly. I hope they continue to cast him in similar roles to this one. If you like action movies with a purpose and a solid action cast, this is the movie for you.",1395792000,,350,4.318181818181818
