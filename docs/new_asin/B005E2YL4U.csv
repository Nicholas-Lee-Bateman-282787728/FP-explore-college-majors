4663406,3,B005E2YL4U,"What i do know is that the footage is better than the dragon boxes but until it is officially released we won't truley but from what i've seen, the blu ray footage looks better than any of the releases in color and quality. These use the original master unlike the false statement of the Dragon Boxes using them. The Dragon Boxes used the tape masters that didn't age but still had saturation. I'm not saying they suck but its regarded high b/c of it's packaging, opening and ending credits original text, previews, & no ommitted songs (Orange Bricks -__-). But if someone does know, will these have the Dragon Box footage? Why downgrade when the Dragon Boxes are out right? So, the logical thing is to release these forever-to-release-the-entire-show's blu-rays with all that footage...... right? Well, other than that, the image is the best from all the releases so far and the truest representation to the original thing (remember, most of us don't know if it has dragon box footage).",1315872000,3,987,4.811764705882353
4663407,5,B005E2YL4U,I am overly excited about this.  i  know they just came out with Kai and almost done with it but I still love the series.  I will definitely be buying both Kai and original cause there is some slight differences in them.  so just for principles I plan on getting both. :)  Plus if we are lucky and enough people buy it maybe it will convince them to make a new series..... that won't suck like GT did.  You never know guys.,1315699200,17,423,4.097560975609756
4663408,4,B005E2YL4U,"When Dragon Ball Z was originally announced to be digitally remastered I had mixed feelings considering at that time I've spent 8 grand on the Japanese Dragon Boxes which were a far superior product than season sets ever were of course they were also remastered terribly.  DBZ Level 1.1 seems to be a great remaster that actually is pretty good however what masters they used is unknown, are they remastering the best print out there?  Or are they remastering there already horrible masters that the season sets used?  I guess time will tell and 17 episodes for blu-ray is far from bad considering a traditional US season is 13 episodes, however it doesn't chance the fact that most Japanese season range from 30 to 40 episodes a season as One Piece is a huge example of this.

After seeing the demo shown I can tell you that whatever masters they used were better than the season sets but the video wasn't the best as it was probably a bad digital recorder but it did give an idea of what the colors would be like and it did feel Dragon Boxish.  The only thing I hope for s that it will be like when I originally watched dragon ball z in the early 90s, 1993-1996.  I am pretty sure they'll use the Japanese track that the dragon box's use as anything else is just awful.

Personally I rather have this than Kai and hope they redub considering Gohan's, Bulma's, and a few others VA are no longer with funimation and have been replaced with better actors and actors that that are close to their Japanese counterparts.  Colleen is so close to Nozawa it's not funny!",1314576000,3,1563,4.47887323943662
4663409,5,B005E2YL4U,"I had mixed thoughts about this set, until I saw the live youtube event for it. I knew this had to be mine. This review will be short and sweet. I picked it up expecting to see amazing quality, and I had just that. I was blown away. This is a mini Dragon Box. You get the original 4:3 aspect ratio, plus the choice of original japanese audio over english dub, original english audio, and original japanese audio with or without subtitles. Another amazing thing, are the menus. These feel very much like Toonami, a block that once aired DBZ on Cartoon Network. Where there are many pros, there are some cons. The one major flaw is the lack of episodes, which doesn't even really bother me because I enjoy buying DVDs in bigger sets. In this one however, there will be 18 blu ray's to collect. Keep that in mind. Other than that, I find this set an A+. This IS the greatest way to experience the original Z.",1313884800,6,905,4.329411764705882
4663410,1,B005E2YL4U,"The fact that there are 291 episodes means there will be $449.82 worth of Blu-Ray in this collection (18 discs).  I'd be a lot happier with each saga on it's own blu-ray mini box set, then to end up with 18 separate discs costing a fortune.

And this is after releasing a terrible Kai edition of DBZ saga nearly gutting it to nothingness.

4663411,1,B005E2YL4U,"When I heard funimation was releasing the dragonbox, I decided to hold out on buying them because I figure they might one day release Dragon Ball Z on Blu Ray. Considering Funimation has released this series 4 times already. So finally I got my wish. But the problem is this set is only 17 episode long. Come on funimation this set should be at least 30 episodes long. This show has been release 4 times by you. I understand if this was one piece which isn't that popular, it needs a fanbase in america and its never been officially released in the states. But this is dragon ball z its been released 4 times in america and its got the biggest anime fanbase in america right next to naruto. I reccommend that you skip this and wait until funimation releases dragonball z blu ray box sets with more episodes considering the fact that this series is 291 episodes long.",1312502400,14,866,4.452830188679245

4663415,1,B005E2YL4U,"Yes. Funimation has indefinitely postponed the Dragon Ball Z Blu-Ray restorations (though not Kai). This is a sad day indeed. Apparently there is a technology or other issue. But Level 1.2 was the last, though there might be advance copies of 2.1 floating around.

But as of Jan 2012, this restoration project has been indefinitely postponed (likely cancelled)!

I just thought everyone would like to know before buying the available copies and then not having the rest of the set coming out anytime in the foreseeable future.

In the meantime, DBZ Kai is what I have been purchasing. It does chop out a lot of the filler content, but it holds true to the DBZ story that Akira Toriyama created and intended before Toei started stretching the series out longer. The restoration on the Kai Blu-Ray is pretty amazing for the most part. I understand it is a simpler restoration process, but watching on a 46"" TV from my PS3, the show looks great. And they kept the 4:3 ratio.

But for DBZ Level (insert # here)? You Fail on this one Funimation! I will delete this review when they announce they are producing the rest of these sets.",1332288000,16,1128,4.653266331658291

This is 4:3 however, so Funimation is scamming the public. If you own the original season sets, stick with those and play them on your 360/PS3/Blu-Ray player in order to upscale to HD.

4663423,5,B005E2YL4U,"Dragon Ball Z fans are lucky in the fact that the series has been put on a variety of home video options. Many animes only get periodic releases and are thus hard to find (like Death Note). Many don't even have Blu-Ray editions. Well, Funimation is now putting out the DBZ series on Blu-Ray. The HD quality is stunning and fans will be pleased to note original aspect ratio and color scheme. If you have not invested in the Dragon Boxes then these are the clear route to go to own DBZ. The Dragon Boxes (as of this writing) are becoming harder to find and more expensive. The quality of the Dragon Box picture is very good, however, it is no match for what you will find on these sets. The major drawback is that these sets do not have a hardcover book or neat slipcase akin to the Dragon Boxes. Nope, these are just two disc Blu-Ray sets. Each set holds 17 episodes and if Funimation keeps to that pattern then there should be 17 releases (some sets will probably have a couple more or less episodes). The next editions (2.1 and 2.2) are slated for a March release. Yes, Funimation is milking it but the fans are getting a superior product compared to prior releases.",1325376000,,1168,4.387096774193548
4663424,2,B005E2YL4U,"Like many here I am a huge DBZ fan as I grew up with it as a child when it was on Toonami. I love the fact that the series has caught up with the times and has been remastered in such beautiful picture quality. The episodes are just as I remember them so long ago and are awesome to watch as an adult now. I do however have some major complaints. One is the price of each Blu Ray disc, 17 episodes is not really a fair trade off for the price. Two I can not stand the aspect ratio being stuck at 4:3. I understand that this is how it was originally was aired, but I would like it to at the least fit my screen. Maybe I am a bit OCD but having a 4:3 aspect being played within a 16:9 black box sucks. I really hope they don't carry this trend over in to the newer episodes.",1325116800,,772,3.801242236024845
4663425,1,B005E2YL4U,"After updating the firmware, I had hoped that would change the lack of quality on this disc.  Nope!  Dragon Ball Z Kai looked better.  This has no 16x9 aspect ratio, just 4:3 on a 16x9 screen.  Extremely grainy, Sound is okay, but not worth the money.  If you own it on regular DVD that should suffice for now.  Save yourselves about 25 dollars do not buy this.  You'd be better off buying the action figures.  It clearly was not what I was hoping for.",1324080000,2,452,4.2976190476190474
4663426,5,B005E2YL4U,"This review primarily concerns the HD video quality of the ""Dragon Ball Z"" Level 1.1 Blu-ray Disc (BD).

This Blu-ray presentation, which features the show in its native 4:3 aspect ratio, is based on a new telecine (the film-to-video process) of 16mm film materials FUNimation has had for a good number of years. What they received from Toei were film prints that are two or three generations removed from the original negatives. Scanning from a film print is not ideal, but sometimes--as in this case--doing so creates pleasing results (and other times, also in this case, it's all anyone CAN do, since Toei never hand anyone their negatives).

Provided for the telecine process was the TAF (telecine analysis film), which specifies what the colors, blacks, and whites should be. This new HD scan reflects what the original animators had made. Unlike the Dragon Box DVDs, colors and saturation look more level with no contrast boosting and the like. Black levels are solid black, reds are more red, etc. This is what the makers of the anime series intended.

Because the series was shot on 16mm film, grain is intense. Grain is what composes the image on film; to remove grain is to remove critical detail along with it (and you obviously can never fully eliminate grain; attempts to remove all traces of ""visible grain"" result in highly smoothed-over picture quality void of detail). However, since this new HD master was struck from 2nd- or 3rd-generation film prints, additional grain is laid on top. FUNimation handled this with a light grain filtering which largely preserves the grain and does not ruin any of the line art and background painting detail, but does cause the grain to look slightly patchy at times. I would have preferred them to leave the grain alone, but the filtering they did does nothing to ruin the image. What's left is an image that's still intensely grainy, and detail is preserved.

In addition to grain filtering, frame-by-frame dirt, scratch, tape, and other debris cleanup was applied. I applaud FUNimation for handling the ugly bits in this way, rather than applying an automatic noise reduction process which would have undoubtedly destroyed the line art and overall picture integrity. (See the ""orange brick"" season DVDs to see how NOT to handle dirt and other defects.)

The picture quality is simply beautiful, and it boggles my mind to think that we're viewing ""Dragon Ball Z"" in this high of quality considering the show was originally broadcast in lo-fi analog video. What's interesting to note is that the opening to each episode was sourced from the first movie, ""Dead Zone"" (evident by the EIRIN certificate number in the lower right of the title), but that's no problem since it's the same intro as the first number of episodes from the TV series. However, this does make the ""standard definition vs. HD restored"" comparison in the extra featurette on disc two a bit misleading, since this opening would have been sourced from 35mm, so it's of higher quality than the episodes themselves. The opening and closing do not contain Japanese credits (and the closing features English credits even if you're watching it in Japanese). Reason being is FUNimation were never given film elements for the opening and closing that contain the opticals for the credits. I'll take a ""clean"" opening in HD sourced from 35mm over a standard definition opening with credits, though it would have been nice for FUNimation to provide the SD opening/closing with Japanese credits as extras. Next episode previews are also missing for the same reason, though again, providing the SD video as an option would have been nice if enough disc space is available.

The only major gripe I have with the HD video are that the episode title cards are only in English. Seems that FUNimation threw alternate angles out the window long ago. I always appreciated seeing the Japanese title cards on my ""Dragon Ball"" Saga DVDs, so this feels like a major step back to me. The English translations of the original titles are a whole lot more interesting to me than the English dub titles, and on top of that, I find the Japanese title cards to be much more aesthetically pleasing (despite not being able to read the kanji). Hopefully it's a problem that will be rectified on future sets. However, it's not such a major gripe that it will prevent me from purchasing future sets even if the original cards aren't provided. The video quality is otherwise astounding, so I'll happily but begrudgingly suck it up if things continue this way.

There are three Dolby TrueHD audio options: original Japanese mono, English with Japanese music 5.1, and English with redone American music stereo. The Japanese mono is one channel; I think I would have preferred 2.0 dual mono, though purists may have issue with that. I believe there's no reason to be truly disappointed with any of the tracks; those who prefer the English dub with American broadcast music may gripe that the track is only 2.0, but at least it's lossless, when it wasn't even included on the Dragon Boxes at all.

""DBZ"" Level 1.1 on Blu-ray is the finest this show has ever looked on video BY FAR, and will continue to be the standard of quality until Toei Animation scan and restore the original camera negatives (which, given their track record, they may never do). If you're on the fence and you're a videophile, buy it, buy it, BUY IT!",1322352000,38,5406,4.855748373101952
4663427,4,B005E2YL4U,"After watching Dragon Box Vol. 1 and Level 1.1 on my HDTV, I can officially say that Level 1.1 is superior in terms of picture and audio quality. The picture quality is much more accurate to the original Japanese broadcast compared to the Dragon Box sets. Sure there's grain, but that's expected from an old series like this. If you don't like grain, this set is not for you. Just stick with the Orange Bricks sets where they have been DNR'ed to remove grain for your liking. The Level 1.1 set has slightly more picture shown. Where as the Dragon Box sets video have been slightly zoomed. In other words, there is no cropping or zooming with these Level Blu-ray sets. As for the audio, I think it will satisfy both the English dub and Japanese dub fans. For you fans who are looking to buy the Dragon Box sets, don't fall into the hype. Buy whatever you think has the best presentation. Don't just buy the Dragon Box just because it's advertised for the hardcore fans. Having said that, both the Dragon Box and Level sets are great releases. I say, if you have the money buy both. If not, then I highly recommend you buy these Level sets instead.",1322006400,6,1146,4.436018957345971
4663428,5,B005E2YL4U,"When I first heard they were announcing this I had the normal reaction of a lot of fans!! Not Again Why are you milking this to death??? But then as time went on I watched the Dragon Boxes price increase steadily that is when I realized there was a benefit to this set!!! What you may ask well, If you already own the Dragon Boxes you have a problem these sets are rising in prices and are becoming limited print!! So what happens if you scratch one of those discs or they get damaged then you are scrambling for a solution!! Me I have my solution with how many times i watch this series over and over again my Dragon Box sets just would not last!!! Blu Rays however can be scratched multiple times and they still work so this allows my Dragon Boxes to remain in great condition.  I will only watch the Dragon Box on special occasion and watch the Blu Rays when I want to watch Z all the time lol!!! I still can't stand the English Music and I am a dubbed fan the Japanese Score is my preferred score!!! Well usually their are a few exceptions

1. The History of Trunks
2. Mystic Gohan's Theme

Now the video Quality is Amazing the grain makes it look like a show from the early 90's which is how it should look.  The colors although supposedly more accurate to the Dragon Box are amazing but, I prefer the Dragon Boxes colors.  If you are a db fan who loves the English music this is the set you have been waiting for.

Pros
Marathon Mode
4/3 Picture Presentation
Blu Ray Scratch Resistant

Awesome Colors
Cool Character Card Insert

Anyway if you are a hardcore fan of FUNimation's English dub I highly suggest picking this up. If you're a hardcore fan of the original Japanese version get the Dragon Box's. If you want a faithful English dub get Dragon Ball Z Kai. Or if nostalgia is the main purpose for watching this series get the old DVD singles.

We now journey to the depths of hell that is this total abomination of a release! First and for most the picture quality is anything but quality! There is a constant fuzz to the picture.

Next up the English dialogue with Japanese music. This track is the same as the other releases it is blatantly missing the Japanese opening (Cha la head cha la).

Funimation is well known for it's issues with the quality of it's releases however in this case there ""A team of experts worked around the clock to put the greatest anime in history on the cutting edge of modern technology.""

There have been countless upon countless releases of Dragon Ball Z before this and I simply cannot recommend this partial Blu-ray release. For one thing, the entire series is available on DVD as the ""Seasons"" set or ""Dragon Box"" set and those two'll give you more episodes of the show for your money. ""Season One"" has 39 episodes. THIRTY... NINE... How many does this one got? Like, 17? Hell and I think the Dragon Box sets have more. So, where does this ""Level 1.1"" set stand?

4663435,2,B005E2YL4U,"Well, here we are again. Another run with the deeply flawed version of the series. And in sets that will no doubt be running you up to over $100 before they decide to cancel and release in season sets.

Now don't get me wrong, I grew up on this series, it was my favorite anime as a kid. But then I got older and began noticing a few things. The acting was nowhere near what it should have been save for the redubbed first two seasons. The script was full of so many cheesy one-liners that it's ridiculous. The plot barely even MOVED half the time due to ungodly amounts of filler and most of all, the filler writers showed a distinct lack of respect for the manga's author.

Now I already feel the fanboys coming to throw a fit, so I'm going to set this up now: YES, there was disrespect toward Akira Toriyama here. NO, he didn't make too big a deal out of it. Why? Because he saw people enjoying it, it was an honor to see his series animated in the first place, as not every series got one at that time. He's a VERY humble man. But even he has stated he wished they hadn't gone so far at the time. Plus this was the same studio who had animated his first series without this level of disrespect.

Now HOW was it disrespectful? Well for one, they took it upon themselves to ""develop"" these characters in their own way. They added events and occurrences to shape their personality in such a way that the manga wound up taking a strong turn from and they had to find any excuse they could to cover it. And many of these occurrences and tales contradicted what the man had planned for later. Example: King Kai told Goku what he ""saw"" happen to Planet Vegeta, with their ""Guardian"" seeing the evil of the people and wiping them out via meteor as punishment for wiping out the ""Tuffles"". Several problems exist within this tale; first and foremost, who are they to decide that Raditz's comment about their planet being destroyed by a meteor needed this grand tale behind it? Second of all, if the Saiyans were engaged in all-out war on their own world, why in the world would they be sending soldiers off-world to conquer and sell other planets? They'd need all the manpower they could get. And third of all, it contradicted Toriyama's later revelation of Frieza. They actually had to create this ridiculous explanation that King Kai had ""heard"" the tale even though he said it was a witnessed event and that he had not learned of Frieza until he warned Goku... despite Frieza establishing an Empire in King Kai's section of space. Makes NO sense, does it?

Another notable example is a point during the 20 episode ""Saiyan Training"" Filler when Gohan grows his tail back and he and Piccolo encounter Goku's ship he came in as a baby. The ship puts out a projection of a Full Moon, Gohan sees it and turns into an Oozaru (Great Ape, Giant Monkey, take your pick) and Piccolo is forced to destroy the Pod in order to restore Gohan to normal. There are a few holes here as well. First off, Gohan merely sees a projection, a PICTURE of a full moon and transforms? Completely contradicts Vegeta's later explanation of how their power works, the need for Blutz Waves and why they needed to create the artificially in some cases. It also creates a hole in that you WATCH Piccolo blow it apart so badly there's nothing left, and yet somehow Dr. Brief later uses it as a base for the ship he builds Goku to go to Namek. Their explanation: He's Dr. Brief, he can just do that. Nice.

And that's just two examples of how Filler contradicted the manga plot. There's also the fact that it dragged out the pacing to an ugodly level with five minute staredowns and ten minute attack charging. There were annoying scenes of Bulma doing whatever that doesn't matter to the plot on Namek, Yajirobi having to narrate to the press everything we already knew about Saiyans and these characters, Roshi becoming more perverted than ever before, to the point he can't control himself it seems. (He even at one point gropes Bulma while she's mourning the death of her longtime boyfriend and his own student for pity's sake!) Roshi was not that out of control and could be quite serious when the situation demanded.

As for the acting quality, it's pretty below average at points. Now taking into account that they wound up having to dub the show themselves due to a lack of money, and that many of these people had never voice acted before, they did do a good job and should be commended for it. But the first several episodes that they tried to record were extremely awkward. They were trying to sound like the old actors for the sake of consistency for one, but also the lack of experience was showing. Add to that the fact that Sean Schemmel (Goku) was kinda going through a depression at the time and sounded like he was obviously just READING the script (Such as Goku's half-asleep ""Frieeeza, stoooop thiiis."" when he's about to kill his best friend)and it was odd. They soon fell into the roles however and began to make them their own. However, the lack of experience and over-abundance of growls and far-too-gruff voices remained for quite a while. Granted, you can live with it, but it's especially noticeable in these sets, as they had to redub the first 50 or so episodes with their current crew in order to distribute them. That means you have a far more experienced dub (albeit with the cheesy lines in tact) with much better acting RIGHT before you get slammed with the lower quality dub. Far more noticeable than it used to be.

Now again, I'm not TRYING to slam the series, just pointing out some things that people fail to see about it up there on the shrine they place it on. This series is fine if you wanna relive some memories as a kid, or a gift for someone aged 12-16. But if you want a serious tale with better pacing, better acting/writing and more intensity, read the manga. Or watch the uncut Kai sets. That's the way the series was meant to be told. But there are still memories associated with this series, and it introduced most of us to anime in the first place. For that I am forever grateful.",1319068800,6,6097,4.4676840215439855
4663436,5,B005E2YL4U,"(NOTE: Amazon's date states October 17.  On that date, I wrote a different response.  On December 17, I've created a review of this release, so this was actually written on the later date.)

Update 6/9/12: Unfortunately, Funimation suspended all
future releases of DBZ Blu-rays in January 2012 due to Restoration financing.  It's a shame because these Blu-rays are the best way to watch DBZ.  Now that those aren't being continued, and the Dragon Boxes are becoming out-of-print, the only option is the cropped Orange-box versions... please continue the restorations, Funimation.)

At first, it was skeptical.  Funimation making the Blu-rays of the series before Japan does?  New HD masters done by Funimation?  This was the company that gave us the Orange Box sets that had cropped images and controversial picture quality.  It was all justified when they released the Dragon Box, a replica of the Japanese DVD-Boxes which was considered the ultimate way to watch Dragon Ball Z... it no longer isn't.

Yes, believe it or not, the new Blu-rays made by Funimation are actually the BEST way to watch DBZ, period.  The Dragon Box, what would've been considered the Ultimate Edition, actually had its colors changed abnormally and grain reduced (now, these masters were done for the purposes of DVD).
Instead of Funimation using the HD masters that would be used for the Orange Box sets, they went back from scratch and did an all-new frame-by-frame restoration.  The difference from the new and the old masters is that grain is finally shown, the colors are untouched, the telecine wobble and jutters have been greatly reduced, and most of the dirt shown on the Orange Box DVDs have been reduced significantly to near-Dragon Box restoration... though, not entirely, but never distracting.
Those that expect modern Anime picture quality will probably not bother seeing this... or reduce the grain themselves with their TVs, as DBZ now looks like what film should look like... and I couldn't be happier.  DBZ clearly has never looked better.

As for the sound department, behold, big upgrades have occurred. The 5.1 English-with-Japanese-music and the 2.0 American Broadcast audio (the 2.0 track dropped out in the Dragon Box for optimal video presentation.) are presented for the first time in lossless Dolby TrueHD, but the bigger surprise here is that the Japanese audio is now lossless.  This is the first time that the Japanese audio has been given this treatment, as all previous releases would provide compressed audio for the original language of this show.  That's not to say that I hate the dub (though I'm not a fan of the American Music), but giving the original what it deserves is a plus.
NOTE: The original Japanese theme can only be heard in the Japanese Audio, despite the English 5.1 having the Japanese music, as was the case in the orange box sets.  In the Dragon Box, it was corrected.  The reason for bringing back the error is unknown.

Now, that is not to say that the Dragon Boxes were a waste of money.  In terms of DVD representation, it clearly is the best to watch the show possible, provide the best detail and colors (though inaccurate).  In terms of faithfulness, well, I have to declare the Blu-ray the winner... but I do have further opinions on the comparisons.

The plus side for the Dragon Boxes is the inclusion of original Japanese text, ""next-time"" previews and booklets that contain Episode guides and a few bonus bits in the book.  This is not the case for the Blu-rays, as it's just English Text (the opening credits were not translated, but instead, textless), and previews and Episode guides are gone, just an Episode list of the Funimation English titles... thankfully, other than the Booklets, these are minor changes.

The one negative side for the Dragon Box is what the Orange box had that the Funimation Dragon Box didn't have (yet the Japanese Dragon Box had): Marathon Mode.  Don't want to deal with the opening/closing theme and last time previews every time?  The Marathon Mode (or Story Mode in Japan) gets rid of all that, as it presents the story continuously (except for switching discs).
Strangely, Funimation dropped the Marathon mode for the Dragon Box (Why?  Reason: When you select the Japanese track on the menu, you get the next-time previews.  When you select the English track, it goes to another title and removes the next-time previews... why couldn't they have Sean Schemmel provide the narrations for those previews?  Would've kept the marathon mode if they did that... but I digress)
What's even worse is that no chapter break is given between ""last-time"" and the beginnig of the episode.  That means that I have to fast forward and possibly miss a few seconds of the episodes after fast-forwarding... no excuse on leaving out a chapter at that position.

Now, with all of the complaining on this one negative aspect, should this apply to the Blu-ray?  The good news is: the Marathon mode's been brought back.

As far as which version to get, it depends.  If you only have a DVD player, go for the Dragon Box.  For those who have the Blu-ray player, there should be no reason to not upgrade.  The positives definitely outweigh the negatives, so you can't go wrong.  Highly Recommended.",1318809600,7,5253,4.913832199546485
4663437,2,B005E2YL4U,"I am truly disappointed by this. Don't get me wrong, the show is AMAZING! I've been a huge fan of it for all my life. Because of that I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.

The reason I gave it only 2 stars is because this series is being re-released to death, and it's getting quite expensive! First there were the original 3 episode single disks. Then there were the orange box complete saga sets. Then there were the japanese dragon boxes. Then there was Dragonball Z Kai sets. And now the original Dragonball Z on blu-ray. I'm getting tired of having to re-buy the better and improved sets over and over again. Watch, after they release Dragonball Z on blu-ray they'll re-release it in another way, maybe 3D or something.

Now this wouldn't be THAT big of a deal but to charge $35 for one 17 episode set, for a series of 291 episodes will be very expensive, especially for something people have already purchased multiple times over the years.

Hopefully the quality put into the blu-rays will really show and maybe be worth it. But I myself will definitely be waiting for some series price drops on these sets cause I won't be paying anything more than $20 for these.",1317859200,7,1166,4.464788732394366
4663438,2,B005E2YL4U,"Not going to say anything about the quality. For one thing its not close to out yet and I'm sure it will blow me away as it will be the first bluray Dragonball Z I've ever seen. BUT come one Funimation this show started before I was born in 1987. A 20 year old show should NOT be released in such small discs. 17 episodes is terrible for $35, or even for $20. Most tv shows release bluray seasons for $15-20 depending on where you buy it.(Amazon.com of course) and include at LEAST 20 episodes in that season. The last ""true"" Funimation DVD sets had 6 or so discs per set giving you 36 episodes in the first set, which is now less than half the price this is about to go for.(On Amazon.com anyway) Do they have to do this with every single set they release, slowly span it over three years and then finally release box sets at the end to those of us patient enough to wait? By the way, I DID patiently wait for the last one, because I love the Funimation dub and the music they used(sorry Japanese music fans) but by the time they were finally done after 3 LONG years, bluray was here so I immediately said oh well, I'll wait for them to do those. If they take another 3 years for these, who knows, maybe blurays will be replaced by then. For $35 I should be getting at LEAST 1/3 of the episodes of this 20 year old show. Honestly when the entire thing is released in box set collection, if it is any more than $150 total I will just forget it and keep DBZ safely in my memories away from the ""bad men with the big money."" All that said, I'm not even sure if this is the set I'm waiting for anyway. It is 1080p, yes, but is it the original voices or are there sum redubs like in DBZKai? Because I hated some of the new voices. Frieza for instance, ruined it for me. As soon as I heard his voice I turned off the show and haven't wanted to see another episode. I also want the music Funimation used in their original release. NOT the Japanese music which is what DBZKai is using. Sorry, but I just don't like it. I watched my favorite episodes with it playing and it just sounds wrong. Like when Vegeta has his famous moments of rage and he does the huge Final Flash to Cell, the music in the Japanese version just made me feel, idk, like this wasn't an earth-shattering beam about to hit the Earth, but some kind of war time drama play on stage haha. For $35 though, honestly, they should be offering not only Japanese AND English Audio, but both sets of MUSIC as well, don't you think?",1316908800,,2486,4.159751037344399

Later on, they might have more episodes in a set just like they're doing for dbz kai. I would like to see the price go down over time. I would like to purchase this set when the price goes down to maybe 20 dollars. Ive only found one trailer for this, so I need to get more information.

I love the Bruce Faulconer music, that was one reason why I didn't want all of the Dragon Boxes. I am really disappointed that Funimation is not going forward with this set, but I know it took a great amount of time to do each set.

They were cleaned up and still in 4:3 (none of that ""remastered"" wide screen crap that ruined the film quality in the orange bricks) with the original Japanese audio and english dubs.

8467862,4,B005E2YL4U,"Aside from the imperfections that this release has, I'd say it's ranks up as the number one best Dragon Ball Z release to be seen in HD while the others are either cropped/filtered (no need to name them).

Here are the pros of this astounding HD Z edition:
+ It's the original 4x3 Aspect Ratio which is how it's intended to be seen!
+ Picture quality looks amazing in 1080p.
+ Grain has been kept allowing all the detail to remain intact.
+ FUNimation remastered this properly so while they cut out bits which were damaged (on the sides), all for the viewers best experience.
+ The Japanese audio track in this release sounds very good and not muffled but in comparison to the Broadcast Audio it's no match.

Now for the cons:
- Lacks the Japanese credits.
- Neither does it have the NEPs.
- Due to the ageing of FUNimation's 16mm film stock in one of the episodes the colouring of Gohan swaps from natural-pink to purple.
- The subtitles in white with black shadows tend to blend in with the background which makes it somewhat hard to see them at times.
- In 2012 FUNimation officially announced to have this superb release cancelled sadly.

It's really a shame that this absolutely awesome release was canned as it was definitely worth paying the price for it, more so as you'd be getting quality over quantity which is something that FUNimation tends to overdo (the casual customers tend to prefer it too though).

I will also be leaving links for screenshots directly off the Blu-ray as well as what I meant by Gohan's colour swap.",1404604800,2,1535,4.550724637681159

8467866,4,B005E2YL4U,"This review covers both the 1.1 and the 1.2 level set on blu ray, I will try to do my best to write a fair review.

Video- The video looks great, it hasn't been altered and is presented in a 4x3 format, it takes up the entire screen on a widescreen television but there are black bars, this set actually doubles in a way because if I use my TV remote and hit zoom fit to screen then boom I have an image similar to the cropped blu ray set they released.  The picture still has grain to show detail and the colors are wonderful and they aren't washed out.

Audio- I've never had any problems with the DBZ audio in terms of quality, the only problem was whether it was present or not on any particular release.  This one included the 2 English tracks, 1 with Japanese music and one with the ""Bruce"" soundtrack, as always it sound great, if anyone has any questions Ill go more in depth but im fairly certain people are concerned about the video not the audio

Personally I think this set is great and im comparing this to other DBZ releases I own which include the Rock The Dragon set, Orange brick collection, movies on dvd, and finally the dragon box set.  The level set isn't perfect though because its been put on hold and these poor cropped versions have been made instead, ive compared these to the level sets and these are clearly superior in terms of video quality due to picture quality and the fact that it is not cropped.  If your a fan and your looking for the best viewing experience then I cant in good conscious recommend the other blu ray set, Id say go for the Dragon Box set, its quality is wonderful but you'll have  problem acquiring the second set because its quite expensive, around $400 eBay.

In closing I feel everyone should buy these level sets and support them, the other release as shown here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GS4B7GS/ref=s9_newr_gw_d43_g74_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-5&pf_rd_r=0A3DKE4CYRF14Y5GDSQ3&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1688200302&pf_rd_i=507846
Should not be supported, the picture quality is inferior and the cropping is an insult, all it takes is the hit of a button on a TV remote to force a 4x3 image into widescreen with cropping.  what's going to end up happening is people will buy the blu ray set and later on they'll release an uncut 4x3 set that complete and people will run out and buy that too, similar to the people buying the dragon box sets who owned the orange brick sets.  In closing I cant give this 5 stars because its not complete nor will it be but its the best way to watch the Saiyan saga on Blu Ray so for this I give the overall product 4/5 stars.  I know I might've babbled and some people might complain but I wanted to get my message out and I refuse to write a bogus 1 star review on the inferior cropped versions, I hope this helped and if anyone has any questions about the set Id be more than happy to answer them.",1392076800,2,2905,4.5761078998073215
