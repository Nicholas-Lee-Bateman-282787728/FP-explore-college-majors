7380858,5,B0141RBH90,"It may be hard to believe now, especially among millennials with the attention span of a gnat, but 51 years ago a young singer- songwriter named Bob Dylan was at the epicenter of everything cool and cutting edge. Black and white cinematography gives this documentary a timeless feel. You'll see Dylan in his ray bans and white boy 'fro in concert, among friends, perfecting his sparring skills with reporters. This is like an early ""reality"" show except the subject in this case is a true artist who practically invented the modern pop song. Appearances by Allen Ginsberg, Bob Neuwirth, and Joan Baez make this film a cultural and historic treasure. Recommended for anyone who loves music history and creative genius. Even if you were born decades after this doc was made, you'll feel nostalgia for a time when the Beatles, the Stones and of course Dyan were on the cusp of transforming the face of rock n roll.",1454198400,8,911,4.772151898734177

Why not release ALL the footage from Don't Look Back? It all seems to be as good as the released film.

Thanks!",1449014400,,132,4.24
7380863,5,B0141RBH90,"Long before Bob Dylan began his seemingly endless touring and the equally endless production of bootleg material now numbering twelve units with the recent latest outpouring he could be seen warts and all on a very good documentary by D.A. Pennebaker, 1967s Dont Look Back (that don't look back good advice for everybody and advice which Dylan has taken with a vengeance). The specific subject matter here is his famous 1965 tour of England at just that point where he was attempting to finally break out of the acoustic folkie guitar syndrome and become what he probably always wanted to be, a rocker. (And getting booed from at the concert hall by folkie purists who wanted their version of Bob Dylan, the protest guy, but he unfazed just kept bopping that electric guitar.)

The thread that unites old and young Dylan is that brashness and distain for glitter and more importantly that serious distance that he placed between himself, the press and other media (there is great footage of him pulling the hammer down on some austere music critic who wanted to box him in with all kinds of silly questions-to which he promptly gave very silly answers-touche) and his fans and just go about the business of being an entertainer. This is a man who has bid the voice of his generation business goodbye by then although not everybody got the message (maybe because he didn't post it in Variety or some such publication) and between his electric guitar, his motorcycle accident and his seclusion for several years down in Woodstock he went out of the public limelight except through some of the greatest songs of his prolific career.

So this documentary is a very welcome backdrop to the iconic career of Mr. Dylan (although I note that word iconic is well-worn out by now by a media blitz usage which has everything more than three minutes old vying for icon status). A film though that leaves one still wondering about the enigmatic Mr. Dylan (enigmatic my choice to replace iconic as the flavor of the month), leaves me wondering about where he was heading. We know now because he has said so if for no other reason but also because he has those ten million far-flung concerts in venues from converted bowling alleys to large concert halls that he saw himself as a troubadour, as an entertainer. And while he now seems moodier and less engaged back then you could practically touch the charisma coming off the stage when he was on his game.

Of course the trials and tribulations of Bob Dylan are not the only items on display here. We get to see the look of a performer when he or she is backstage or back at the endless hotel rooms. How Dylan practiced and how he wrote lyrics when they just jumped from the typewriter. Got to see him interact with other performers like the up and coming Donovan and the already established Joan Baez (whom he was barely interacting with at that point as they were drifting in different directions, or rather he was drifting in whatever direction he was drifting in). The most revealing information though was a scene in which he was singing along with Baez and Bob Neuwirth some Hank Williams stuff. Amazing. We now know after over fifty years of songs, original and covers, that Mr. Dylan is deeply immersed in the American songbook from Woody Guthrie to Frank Sinatra but who knew then how much he esteemed all those influences. If you are a baby-boomer see this one now to prove that when we were very young back then we were in very heaven and for those younger to know what it was like when men and women played folk/folk rock/rock music for keeps.",1448841600,7,3590,4.650393700787402
7380864,5,B0141RBH90,"Dont Look Back is a documentary by D.A. Pennebaker of Bob Dylans three-week tour of England in 1965, his last as an acoustic performer. The film captures the 24-year-old Dylan at a time when the public was beginning to realize that he had some important, timely things to say. Using cinema verite techniques  hand-held cameras, existing lighting, no bulky and obtrusive moviemaking equipment  Pennebaker was able to squeeze into corners of hotel rooms, backstage areas, press conferences, and onto stages themselves. Because the film is not narrated, the viewer does not rely on subjective commentary. Instead, an unfiltered portrait of Dylan emerges. We see him creating, lounging around, being playful, losing his temper with his entourage, refusing to answer questions posed by British journalists, and performing in concert. The movie shows the contrast between Dylans sweet stage persona and his off-stage, tightly wound self. Joan Baez, Donovan, and Alan Price also appear in the movie but Dylan clearly dominates.

Songs include The Times They Are A-Changin, Its All Over Now, Baby Blue, Its All Right Ma (Im Only Bleeding), The Gates of Eden, and Subterranean Homesick Blues. One of the movies most famous sequences shows Dylan holding cards on which the lyrics to Subterranean Homesick Blues are written. As the song plays on the soundtrack, Dylan reveals one card after another with key lyrics. This was the singers suggestion, and makes for a one-of-a-kind moment.

The new Blu-ray release contains a restored digital transfer, but since the film dates back to 1967, it is not in the pristine condition usually associated with Blu-ray. Bonus content includes 1999 audio commentary with Pennebaker and tour manager Bob Neuwirth; 65 Revisited, a 2006 documentary by Pennebaker; audio excerpt from a 2000 interview with Bob Dylan; featurettes tracing the evolution of Pennebaker's filming style; 3 short films by Pennebaker, outtakes from Dont Look Now, alternate version of the films Subterranean Homesick Blues cue card sequence; 5 recordings of Dylan songs not used in the film; and a booklet with a critical essay.",1447891200,17,2126,5.281065088757397

7380872,5,B0141RBH90,"Pennebaker creates a very detailed look at life on the road for a genuine musician. The documentary puts across a highly detailed account of the hectic life involved in travel, set up, between-concert sessions, and what goes on behind the scenes. What stands out the most is that if you are looking for a biography that explains the musician/music/details in a linear fashion, you will not find it here - nor should you. There is nothing static in a traveling show, and that comes across very clearly - the documentary is neither unstructured nor random, It's put together the way that a music tour is put together- one day at a time, one scene at a time, one song at a time. It's raw, but genuine.",1484524800,,698,4.5476190476190474
