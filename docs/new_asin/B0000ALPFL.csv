1908153,5,B0000ALPFL,"The 1988 film ""Waxwork"" will always hold a special place in this horror fan's heart. On the surface, this movie doesn't seem that original or engaging. A group of young adults, led by Mark Loftmore (Zach Galligan) and Sarah Brightman (Deborah Foreman), decide to head over to a recently opened wax museum in their town for a night of giggles and guffaws. How could anything about a display of wax dummies be particularly frightening? We soon discover something quite ominous is going on behind the doors of this creepy building. The curator of the museum, David Lincoln (David Warner), and his two Addam's Family like cronies seek to open a portal to Hell through which the worst monsters of history will rise again to wreak havoc on the living. In order to accomplish this nefarious plot, Lincoln must procure several living people to sacrifice to the dark gods. The waxwork displays, which reconstruct carefully orchestrated scenes of horrific murder and mayhem in history, are in fact tricks designed to lure these unwary kids to their doom. Once one of these dupes step past the velvet rope in front of a scene, they discover that what they were looking at is real and very dangerous. And one by one, Lincoln secures his sacrifices.

One of the adults finds himself caught in the middle of a gruesome werewolf hunt. A snobby rich girl falls for the penetrating gaze of Count Dracula (Miles O'Keefe of ""Ator"" fame, for goodness sake!), thus discovering that vampires do exist and don't mind gnawing on human drumsticks whenever possible. By the time Loftmore discovers what is going on in the wax museum, most of his friends have perished in graphic, horrible ways. It's only through luck that he manages to extricate Brightman from a particularly sadistic encounter with the Marquis De Sade. The two turn to Loftmore's wheelchair bound uncle, Sir Wilfred (Patrick Macnee), to uncover the particulars of Lincoln's scurrilous goals. According to the knowledgeable Wilfred, David Lincoln has been alive for a hundred years plotting to unleash doom on planet earth. Now that Loftmore's uncle knows exactly where Lincoln is and what he's going to do, he hopes to upset the malevolent curator's museum with the help of a few friends. But Wilfred, Brightman, and Loftmore will have to hurry because Lincoln will soon open the portal. The conclusion to the film is notable because it's probably the only time you'll see the Marquis De Sade and Count Dracula battling a bunch of crusty old British chaps led by a guy in a wheelchair.

""Waxwork II"" goes for high camp, quite possibly on purpose. Galligan returns as Mark Loftmore, but this time there's a bunch of bunkum about a portal through time and space. At the end of the first film, Mark and Sarah destroyed the wax museum, but something survived long enough to follow Brightman home and murder her stepfather. Now the young girl is on trial for her life, and Loftmore must work behind the scenes to save her. Thanks to a tape left behind by Sir Wilfred, Mark finds a device that allows him to travel through time to prove that Sarah is innocent. Or something like that. Whatever happens, ""Waxwork II"" quickly descends into a series of occasionally humorous but more often groan inducing vignettes based on a plethora of classic horror movies. We see the cast here struggling through scenes lifted from ""Alien,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""Jack the Ripper,"" and probably a dozen other cult classics. There's also a continuing plot set in the Middle Ages where Mark must defeat a bunch of baddies to protect a king. Both films are worth a watch, but the original far outpaces the sequel. These films are worth watching because of the cast and the special appearances of what looks like dozens of memorable faces.

Zach Galligan largely exhausted any goodwill he had from ""Gremlins"" by appearing in these types of low budget films, but that doesn't mean he isn't fun to watch. Deborah Foreman needs no props from me; any fan of films made in the 1980s recognizes this gorgeous gal on sight (someone named Monika Schnarre unfortunately replaced Foreman as Sarah in the sequel). Patrick Macnee gets a chance to pile on the ham as Sir Wilfred, and David Warner is as creepy as ever as the nefarious David Lincoln. What really grabs your attention, in the first but particularly the second film, is the number of names appearing in big and small roles. Look for Jonathan Rhys-Davies, John Ireland, Drew Barrymore, Bruce Campbell (in a hilarious turn), Marina Sirtis, Martin Kemp, Michael Des Barres, David Carradine, Alexander Godunov, Maxwell Caulfield, and about a billion other famous faces. Aside from the huge cast lists, prepare yourself for a gore drenching experience in the first film. While ""Waxwork"" doesn't approach the level of ""Dead Alive,"" it does turn the stomach on numerous occasions. The vampire scenes alone should bring forth a few groans of disgust from viewers.

Artisan Entertainment (since purchased by Lion's Gate) saw fit to put both films on a single disc. It's nice to have them on DVD but regrettable the disc contains nothing more than a trailer or two. I consider ""Waxwork"" a cult classic worthy of a commentary track at the very least, but I am glad to see the movie reach DVD despite this omission. Also, rest assured that you are watching the unrated version of ""Waxwork"" on the Artisan disc--the R rated version runs ninety-five minutes while this one runs ninety-seven. If you haven't indulged in the campy, loopy fun that is the ""Waxwork"" franchise, you need to add this one to your must have list as soon as possible.",1094947200,19,5594,4.848326359832636
1908154,5,B0000ALPFL,"These movies I have watched over and over and have even memerised alot of the lines. ""So my pretty you too feel a bit peckish"" ""raw meat"". Classic. And the echo sounds and the slurps when the vampires are eating the ""raw meat"". not to mention the costumes. All in all excellent. Oh and Deborah Foreman from ""valley girl"" and Zach Galligan from ""gremlins"" perfect for the parts. I am a big fan of Madame Troussiants waxworks and loved the Vincent Price movie where he too used ""bodies"" for his works. Everyone who I have shown these movies to have always told me thanks for sharing such campy classics.",1082592000,,601,4.522935779816514
1908155,4,B0000ALPFL,"Artisan does it again by releasing this great double feature DVD. If the original Waxowrk wasn't good enough, you also get its awsome sequel. For those of you who haven't see Waxwork, don't be fooled into thinking this is going to be a totally serious scary as hell movie. I is actually very toungue in cheek and has many funny moments. In the wake of Re-Animator, there were many immitations on mixing humor and gore, and Waxwork is one of the better films to come out of the mix. The sequel is almost just as good as the original and portrays many cameos that you will recognize (Bruce Campbell and Drew Barrymore to name a few). Two very entertaining film a cheap price. Now te downside. Originally when Waxwork was released on VHS, it was released in two seperate verions: an R-Rated and an Unrated. Sadly, the R-Rated version is the one present on the DVD which makes me worried that the Unrated will never be released. Another complaint is the picture quality. Artisan needs to start remastering these things. All their double feature DVD's are grainy. But that aside, don't let those downsides stop you from purchasing this DVD, its well worth it.",1067817600,29,1154,4.661764705882353
1908156,3,B0000ALPFL,"WAXWORK
WAXWORK is what you would call a ""guilty pleasure"" of a movie. I saw it for the first time when it originally came out and remember it to this day as one of those rare straight to video movies that was actually worth remembering. What can I say? It's a fun movie.
As the story goes, a group of spoiled brat rich kids (including Zack Galligan ofGREMLINS fame and Dana Ashbrook who was the lead in RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD PART II) are invited to a special party at a new wax museum in their neighborhood. So, being curious they go and roam the museum unattended and conveniently get seperated from one another. One by one each of them accidentally steps into a display and are then transported directly into the scene and forced to play the part on display, fighting for his or her life. When they don't succeed, they then become a permanent part of the scene as the waxwork becomes their new home. This is where the fun comes in. The kids step in to every type of display you could imagine ranging from Dracula and The Wolf Man to the Marquis de Sade.
All in all, WAXWORK is campy and fun and that's, I believe, what makes it worth remembering. This movie, in no way shape or form, does it take itself seriously. Still, it isn't lacking on the gruesome effects. Some of the stuff during the Dracula segment is
pretty gory stuff. However, as I said before, the silm suceeds the most in it's camp value. I would suggest WAXWORK for true fans of the horror-comedy. While not as strong as
any of the EVIL DEAD films, the same type of humor is present and for the most part, it works.
WAXWORK II
WAXWORK II simply isn't as enjoyable as the first to me but it's still a good time and may even be a tad bit funnier. While there isn't much wax, there is plenty of time travel which serves as the way the second film begins spoofing horror films such as ALIEN and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, among others.
The thing that stands out to me above all else in WAXWORK II is none other than Bruce Campbell, who appears in a hilarious segment where he gets hurt in several ridiculous ways. It truly is a funny moment. Other than that, most of the fun in this silly sequel comes from trying to guess which movie is being spoofed.
In the end though, while funny at times, WAXWORK II is recommended mainly for fans of the original and for die hard Bruce Cambell fans. Combined together though, the WAXWORK films make for one amusing, fairly priced DVD expierience.

1908157,3,B0000ALPFL,"Waxwork is a great 80s horror/comedy/thriller in the Fright Night vein.  Sometimes scary, clever, humorous and gory, it takes you on a fun-filled, malicious little trip.

1908158,3,B0000ALPFL,You can't beat two movies for the price of one.  It's too bad that both movies are in full screen but I can't complain too much for the price.  The first one is a pretty good movie with a mix of comedy and horror.  The special effects are pretty good considering the time it was made.  The second movie is a real star filled stinker.  I can't believe it was written and directed by the same guy.  Even Bruce (don't call me Ash) makes a cameo.  I really felt sorry for him in a short embarrassing role.  I don't think he even took credit on the back of the DVD case.  One cool thing about the second film is the spoof on classic horror films including Dawn of the Dead.  Overall picture and sound is just ok but nothing special.  Worth the price even though the second movie is a stinker.,1065571200,4,787,4.145695364238411

1908205,5,B0000ALPFL,"Waxwork is a classic in the Horror genre.
It's sequel was good as well. I can't believe these flicks don't have a bigger cult following, the original especially. It follows a formula of the 80's horrors, with elements of classic monster movies from the 50's. The cast is great, the music is well crafted and good homage to the works of Hans J. Salter and James Bernard (who scored a lot of great horror films of their period), and the effects are cheesy, but hey. It was the 80's!
Practical makeup effects I find in old movies are more entertaining than just some hyper-realistic CGI.
Waxwork (1988) A group of rich college kids who go to a midnight showing at this waxwork where the displays are more than they seem. Each one is a macabre, disturbing sight recounting an event from actual history or something straight out of a horror movie. A few of these displays are missing something: a victim.
The characters end up drawn into a display, which turn out to be real living nightmares on the other side, and become permanently part of the scene.
And there's something even far more sinister at work.
The sequel picks up right from where the original left off.

The second movie on the other hand is my absolute favorite and I've already watched it three times since I've gotten it. Instead of going through different ""worlds"" by going into wax displays in a museum; Mark Loftmore and Sarah Brightman are traveling through periods in time.

1908234,4,B0000ALPFL,"On a recent excursion through our friendly neighborhood Walgreens I made my usual half glance pass at their DVD rack. It's always hit and miss, especially at Walgreens who seems to get mostly Wal-Mart dumpster bin rejects. Yet, on this fateful day, I was pleasantly surprised to see the Waxwork collection sitting on the bottom shelf next to two other no name titles.

At this point I had never heard of this particular film, but being a big fan of the original House of Wax from 1933 as well as the 1953 remake I decided it was worth the dollar fifty I shelled out for both movies. (What is that? 75 cents for each movie? Not a bad deal if I say so myself). After all, there aren't enough horror movies about Wax Museums. Seriously, Museums in general are creepy places filled with ancient relics from God knows where. They deserve more of a place as looming icons in the horror genre.

This collection is an extremely pleasant surprise and is well worth the money. It isn't anything special and doesn't have any paper inserts but it is a sturdy and well put together DVD. The case is sturdy plastic and not those more recent crappy recycle DVD cases with the holes. I hate those. The DVD case has the same beautiful artwork from the original movie.

Something about that classic 80's hand painted horror movie art is too good to pass up. I want to beg film companies to do the same with newer movies but I don't foresee that ever happening.

The DVD content itself isn't anything to rave about. There are no special features even though the back claims that the special features are ""Full Screen Version, English Closed Captioning, 2.0 Dolby Stereo Sound, Scene Selection."" As we all know those aren't special features. It is basically just the two movies with scene selection for each movie. (Which is more than some real cheapy DVD's can even claim.)

Either way, it's a good sturdy DVD if you just want both movies in one pack.

1908238,4,B0000ALPFL,"Im mostly writing this review to address the concerns about the Uncut vs rated R debate going on with this double feature version of Waxwork 1.  Many people on here are trying to say that part one is the uncut version just because they are reading the time listed on the back of the DVD as well as the ""uncut"" rating listed.  As someone who has actually owned the VESTRON VHS (no longer unfortunately so I cant take screen caps to prove anything) I can say that this is NOT the case.  This version, while it may be ""unrated"", is NOT the directors unrated cut.  That is ONLY available on VHS, which was released by Vestron in 1989.  The sku is 028485152908 and the ISBN: 0-8051-0646-4.  There is even an issue of Fangoria magazine with an interview with Anthony Hicox where he states the Unrated version is still cut.  Here are a few cuts in particular that I personally noticed to be missing:

The Werewolf scene:

- Cuts before the victim is completely ripped in half

The Vampire scene:

- Cuts before the full head explosion in the cellar.
- Cuts before you see the piece from the leg picked off.
- Portions of the mistresses attacking are quickly edited together missing some blood splatter

Mummy scene:

- Cuts before the black ooze stuff starts coming out of the mummy's mouth (VERY noticeable because the shot after he emerges shows his mouth and body has the residue dripping still).
- Cuts before the full head stomp skull pops.

Basically just a few frames of gore are missing. It's almost as if the movie has the before and after of the gore scenes but not the middle part actually showing the action.

NOW, having said all that, Waxwork is one of the best horror films of the 80s, filmed at a time when Horror occasionally mixed with comedy and other genres.  This movie caters to fans of the old universal films as well as the classic 80s teen monster flicks.  The second movie was not nearly as enjoyable, however the cameos and the references easily make it viewable at least once.

1908246,4,B0000ALPFL,"Lets take a moment to remember those fun Waxwork films for a few moments.  Not classics exactly, but to know them is to enjoy them for the most part.  I initially saw the first film on HBO(of course) when I was in middle school.  Stayed up way past my bedtime to watch it on a school night, but I was glad I did.  I ended up taping it on my VCR(oh yeah, that's right, VCR!), and watched it time and time again.  Naturally I forced many of my friends to do the same.
Waxwork was the directorial debut of Anthony Hickox, son of Douglas Hickox, who had directed the greatly entertaining Theater of Blood with Vincent Price.  Anthony would later inherit franchises(Warlock 2, Hellraiser 3), make a few originals(Full Eclipse, Sundown: The Vampire In Retreat), and do some straight to video action films,  but it's the Waxwork films that seem like they are truly his babies.
Waxwork has a group of friends led by Zack Galligan(yes, THE Zack Galligan), a dorky richboy, attending a private showing at newly opened wax museum, run by the great David Warner.  The wax displays(they're actors trying not too convincingly to stand perfectly still) show mini scenes involving monsters and madmen, both historically real and fictional.  Once you step past the ropes, you enter the alternate reality that the display represents, and you appear to the other characters as a character from that particular scenario.  Basically your destiny is to die and wind up a wax addition to the display back in the real world.
David Warner's wacky plan is to feed a soul to all 18 of his displays, thus bringing them back to life and starting an apocalypse or some such nonsense.  Galligan catches onto this scheme with the help of his godfather, Sir Wilfred(Patrick MacNee!!), and with his female friend, Sarah, takes on the duty of destroying the waxworks and saving the friggin' day!
Hickox takes on a rather ambitious project with his first movie and working with a low budget.  Numerous sets and effects are used to create multiple worlds and realities, and he really pulls it off.  The werewolf doesn't look half bad, and the brief Black and White homage to Night of the Living Dead is pretty good.
Galligan is fun and you can't help but like him, but he comes across as such a schmuck that you actually feel kinda sorry for the guy.  His luck with women is lousy.  The sexy Michelle Johnson gives him the boot for a hunky football player, and when Galligan sets his sights on the cute, virginal Sarah(the radiant Deborah Foreman), she turns him down!  As clumsy and dorky as he is, he manages to be the hero.
Warner seems a bit like he's phoning it in, but he's always good to watch.  Other familiar B movie faces pop in like Miles O'Keefe and John Rhys-Davies.  Hickox himself can't resist a small role.
The movie has a bunch of plot holes, inconsistencies, and tends to break rules it establishes early on.  However, the movie kinda falls apart in it's final act where Hickox totally shifts gears and goes for an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach, especially in the final battle.  The movie was tongue in cheek from the start, but it takes a drastic turn into all out zany and cartoonish during the battle between Galligan and a small group of MacNee's buddies, and the living waxwork monsters.  Goofy one liners are thrown around fast and furious, weapons seem to appear out of nowhere into characters' hands, Galligan suddenly becomes an adequate swordsman, and a chicken flies into MacNee's lap!
I'm not a big fan at how this last act was handled.  Maybe if the whole film had been in this tone, that would be one thing, but it's just too big and sloppy of a change.  It really doesn't work.  But hey, it's Hickox's first film.  Maybe he's bi-polar and felt really manic at the time he was shooting the last act.
Either way, Waxwork is great popcorn B movie fun.
Waxwork 2, while featuring no waxworks, continues the story right after the first film's end.  Unfortunately Deborah Foreman has now been replaced by Monika Schnarre, and she's a poor substitute-not even close in the cuteness and charisma department(Foreman was Hickox's girlfriend during the first film, so I can only assume it was a breakup, and not a good one.  He did manage to cast her in his vampire comedy, Sundown: The Vampire In Retreat).
Sarah's father has been killed by the severed zombie hand that escaped the climactic fire of the first film.  Sarah's arrested and put on trial for the murder.  Trusty ol Zack Galligan comes to her rescue, and with the guidance and gadgets of Sir Wilfred, the go on an adventure through time in order to bring back an artifact from the past that will corroborate Sarah's story for her defense.  Yes, it's pretty damn silly.  There are no wax figures, but the setup is pretty much the same with the characters stepping into alternate realities as characters in the scenes they have entered.  Hickox has more opportunities to pay tribute and pay homage to the films he obviously loves.  Our heroes jump through tributes to Frankenstein, Alien, Dawn of the Dead(where another severed zombie hand is acquired), The Haunting(featuring Bruce Campbell doing his Evil Dead slapstick schtick) and Invasion f the Body Snatchers.  The bulk of the movie is set in a sword and sorcery fantasyland where Galligan has to stop Sarah from wedding the evil tyrant who wants to kill the king....blah, blah,blah.  This gives Galligan the chance to have long hair, wield a sword and say heroic things like, ""Let the girl go!!"".  He's still dorky as ever, maybe even worse in this film.
The tone here is more in vein with the final act of the first film.  Very zany and comical.  My God, there's even a Waxwork 2 rap song at the end!!
Patrick MacNee makes a brief cameo as does David Carradine and that blonde shoot-the-glass guy from Die Hard.
Waxwork 2 is just as much fun as the first film.  More lighthearted and Back to the Future-esque, but almost as enjoyable.
A great double feature for the price, and a couple of films that deserve being rediscovered.
On a sidenote I must state that Waxwork is the R rated version.  Tiny bits of gore that were present on my VHS-from HBO copy are not here.  It's so little though that it really doesn't matter.",1326067200,,6235,4.678276810265811

1908251,3,B0000ALPFL,"Quick true story about the original ""Waxwork"" before I dive into the meat of my review: I went to a test screening of this film when I was in high school, circa late 1987/early 1988. I thought the film kicked all kinds of butt, and I remember filling out the little comment card at the end of the show (""What did you like about the movie? What didn't you like?"") raving about the makeup and gore effects, and I probably told them that the blonde who played ""China"" was ""freakin' hot"" or words to that effect. (I have always wondered if that comment got back to her. ""Hey babe, some geek in Jersey thought you were hot."") I don't recall if ""Waxwork"" ever got a legitimate theatrical release after that test screening, but when I rented it on VHS some time later, I was dismayed to find out that much of the kick ass blood and gore shots that I'd grooved on at the free preview had been edited. I am, however, happy to report that the version of ""Waxwork"" on the double feature DVD released by Artisan Entertainment appears to be that original, uncut version that I saw many years ago. (Though both films are in fullscreen, not widescreen...SIGH! I guess you can't have everything...) End of commercial.

Okay then!! ""Waxwork"" is a mostly forgotten lil' gem of '80s horror comedy. The plot is pretty simplistic: in a nutshell, Zach Galligan of ""Gremlins"" fame and a bunch of his fellow spoiled, rich California friends get invited to a ""preview showing"" at a soon-to-be opened wax museum in their town, only to find when they arrive that they're destined to become part of the various sculptures. The ""waxworks"" of such famed evil doers as the Marquis De Sade, Jack the Ripper, Dracula, etc., etc. are actually portals to other dimensions, where the young cannon fodder becomes trapped as part of some sorta convoluted voodoo worshipping plot to unleash Evil on Earth and bring around the End of All Things, or something like that. So the story's ridiculous, but the various set pieces and segments featuring the ""Waxwork"" characters are like a sampler platter of some of horror's greatest moments, particularly the Werewolf segment and the scene set in a den of vampires (where blood literally paints the walls!!!). All Galligan cares about is rescuing his virginal, never-had-it-but-really-wants-to love interest from the grip of the Marquis De Sade, and by the time his godfather (Patrick MacNee of ""The Avengers"" no less!) and his merry band of British supernatural fighters arrive to save the day, you're either gonna be laughing your head off or you're going to be saying ""I hate this movie."" I personally would've preferred it to lean harder on the ""horror"" end and less on the ""comedy"" but when ""Waxwork"" gets nasty (as in the aforementioned Werewolf and Vampire scenes), it provides a decent amount of shocks and some killer old-school creature and gore FX. First time writer/director Anthony Hickox has become a genre veteran, having gone from ""Waxwork"" to films like the underrated ""Full Eclipse,"" ""Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth,"" and ""Warlock: The Armageddon"" to name just a few. Perhaps ""Waxwork"" is still a little rough around the edges but it shows that even at this early stage in his directing career, Hickox already had an eye for cool set pieces, interesting staging, and of course plenty of bloody action.

""Waxwork"" is an entertaining little time capsule that should bring a smile to the face of any '80s horror fan. They really don't make'em like this anymore.

I found Anthony Hickox's 1992 sequel to be a bit of a let down. Zach Galligan returns (though the girl who played his love interest from the first movie has been recast) as the unlikely college aged hero ""Mark,"" who saved his girlfriend ""Sarah"" from the evil Waxworks at the end of the first movie. Unfortunately one of the exhibits from said Waxwork - a severed zombie hand with a life of its own - follows Sarah home and kills her stepfather with a hammer, so she ends up on trial for his murder. The only way to clear Sarah's name is for her and Mark to use the ""portals"" again to travel through dimensions and hopefully bring back some evidence that will clear her name.

So far, so good, and ""Waxwork II: Lost In Time"" starts off well enough, with the characters tripping through a series of quick set pieces inspired by classic horror movies; there's some hilarious bits inspired by ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Haunting"" (watch for Bruce Campbell's cameo in this one), and an ""Alien"" parody that even has a halfway decent looking monster. Unfortunately the film stops cold when both Mark and Sarah end up trapped in a Middle Ages setting, in a segment that takes up the bulk of the movie. Sarah is to be betrothed to the evil count Scarabis, and it takes for-freakin-EVER for Mark to save her from a lot of silly medieval doings. Alexander Godunov (aka ""The Big Blonde Russian Guy from Die Hard"") is pretty wooden as Scarabis, and I basically sat there the entire time wishing that they would just get out of the Arthurian era already and go back to quickly zipping through various horror movie parodies. If they were going to stick with one ""genre"" for almost half the movie, they should've used the ""Dawn of the Dead"" setting that we only see for about thirty seconds as a throwaway joke.

In short ""Waxwork II,"" like its predecessor, has a few laughs and is technically well made but still is not without its faults. The original ""Waxwork"" had an air of goofy fun about it that seemed natural, but ""II"" constantly feels like it's trying too hard. ""Waxwork II"" is inferior to the original film and leans too hard on the ""comedy"" end of the ""Comedy/Horror"" equation for me. Still, fans of the original will probably want to give it a spin.

Oh, and by the way, make sure you stick around for the rap song and music video that accompanies the end credits, which you simply have to see to believe.",1290297600,3,5880,4.687318489835431
1908252,2,B0000ALPFL,"These movies are somewhat similar to each other. They are tongue in cheek and filled with references to other horror films. They are also almost joyously gory. Unfortunately they are also both very nearly incompetent. Waxwork was mostly terrible. But the end was a hoot. Waxwork II almost literally had no story.

I think what's wrong with both of those movies is that Anthony Hickox (the writer and director of both movies) had some idea of what he wanted to do, but was terrible at writing his ideas into a quality story. People behave in a completely unbelievable manner. I don't mean the usual horror movie 'I'll investigate the mysterious sound' stuff.

Here, it's almost like the writer didn't understand how the world functions. If you just burned down a wax museum and killed all of your friends, the best course of action isn't fleeing the scene and pretending it didn't happen. If you are on trial for murdering your stepfather, they don't let you go home at the end of the day in a taxi with your boyfriend. Flight risk?

Both movies are more comedies than horror films, sure. But they way people behaved here was almost surreal.

Waxwork 4/5

Waxwork is a very entertaining popcorn movie reminiscent vaguely of House of Wax, but with a supernatural twist and much quicker paced. A wax museum springs up overnight run by a man who has made a pact with the devil. As a result of this, he must capture souls. Cue local teenagers. They're drawn into the world of the wax figures.

Each wax exhibit leads to a different fantasy world/death sequence. These include a rather colorful and interesting (but woefully inaccurate, of course) Marquis De Sade, a mummy, Dracula, a werewolf (don't blink or you'll miss John Rhys-Davies from Sliders fame), and assorted other nasties in separate slaher vignettes. They're all very well done and none of the sequences overstay their welcome.

There's also an uncle who studies the occult, a butler reminiscent of ""Lurch"" and plenty of other fun. It's all campy and rather well done and it has a nice climax that is at once an homage and original. The special effects are well done, the movie never drags, and the acting is tolerable. As usual in the genre, dialogue is more or less awful. If you like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evil-Dead-II/dp/6305841861/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evil Dead II</a>, you'll like this movie, too. Gory over-the-top fun without CGI but with good creature effects. It's too bad there aren't more movies like this anymore. Highly Recommended for genre buffs.

Waxwork II 2.5/5

This movie is very hit or miss. Some genre buffs will really like it because of the amount of homage to classic horror films, some won't. Personally, I don't. I think every segment is too long and the director just borrows so much from certain films as to border on plagiarism.

Rather than use his own style (which is really good) the director puts most of his effort into copying other people's. That becomes boring and results in a thematically incoherent and technically inconsistent (the lighting and characters change constantly) work. It starts to border on sketch comedy.

Also, certain segments go on too long. Some others, like the ""Alien"" segment just don't belong in the movie. The medieval segment really derails the momentum of the movie as it attempts to introduce a major villain. It doesn't really matter, unlike Warner's ""Waxwork Man"" from the first film, the actor playing Scarabis (the big bad) has no charisma. They should have brought back Warner.

The story picks up immediately after the first film and involves the main character and his girlfriend (now played by a different actress) travelling through time (in a parallel dimension) to prove that the main character's girlfriend didn't kill her father by stealing something from the past. Yeah, it doesn't make a lot of sense.

Basically, the whole thing is an excuse for the director to show off his chops in several vignettes which pay homage to various horror movies like Frankestein, Dawn of the Dead, Alien, Nosferatu, misc British Horror. It includes a brief appearance by Bruce Campbell (who's one of the movie's highlights) in one of the segments, a black and white homage to British Horror. Also, there's a blink and you'll miss it appearances by Martina Sirtis (Star Trek's Troi).

Personally, I always found this movie midly diverting but boring in spots, but some genre buffs might like it. It's not horrible and there are far worse ways to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon, but it doesn't have a clearcut villain until one emerges ex nihilo in the last act. It's writing 101 not to do that. The villain should have something to do with the central conflict.

Fair's fair though - the movie has a great swordfight at the end which is the highlight of the movie (along with Campbell's rather funny bit), but that can't compensate for the nosnensical plotting and dull pacing. Personally, I felt more like I was watching a demo reel showcasing the director's skills than a movie.

Limited Recommendation. Worth watching because you essentially get it for free with the other movie, but really for genre buffs only. Like I said, some genre buffs will really appreciate the homages to other films. I didn't. I just thought it was derivative and occasionally a mild bit amusing.

Overall:

On the whole, this is a pretty good purchase for horror genre buffs, especially people who like the Evil Dead series of movies. The disc itself has no special features - which is a minus because I really would've liked something on the special effects in the movies. Both movies are on one disc, single-sided.

1908256,5,B0000ALPFL,"I love horror from the 80's; it's practically its own subgenre. 80's horror was fun, gory, cheesy, over the top and just plain great. Waxwork embodies all of this. This might just be my favorite movie to come out of the eighties, because even though it borrows from classic horror (Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy, Invisible Man, etc.), it is still a wildly original movie. Every display in the Waxwork contains a creature or maniac, and every display needs a soul to accompany it. Once all the displays are filled with the requisite soul, all the said creatures and maniacs come back to life. Now the movie definitely has a massive cheese factor in the acting and the seemingly make-it-up-as-I-go-along plot, but that's just part of its fun. The set design, costume design and practical FX work are just amazing, and there's plenty of blood and great kills to satisfy most gorehounds. If you are a fan of 80's horror, this is simply a must have for your collection.

And as a bonus you get the sequel on the same disc. And I have to say the sequel is also pretty great. Not as good as the original, but still awesome. This one has the survivors of #1 supposedly traveling through time, but really they're just traveling through classic movies. You'll notice Aliens, The Haunting, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Dawn of the Dead and more. But this movie does not rip them off, it's a complete homage. This movie is more about humor and silliness than the original, but it works, but also there's still plenty of gore. Once again the set designs and costumes are top notch, while the effects work is a mixed bag. There is some excellent practical FX work together with some horrendous old CGI. Notable supporting cast includes the late, great Buck Flowers, Bruce Campbell, David Carradine and that guy from Die Hard, sorry, I don't remember your name. Definitely a worthwhile sequel, and just icing on the cake for this DVD release.",1243555200,4,1960,4.747800586510264

1908258,4,B0000ALPFL,"Waxwork: A group of college students become involved in a plot to resurrect the 18 most evil people who have ever lived by means of a waxworks museum.

It's sad that this horror movie from the 1980's has been more or less forgotten, since it is smarter and better than most of the other teen horror movies of its time (and of today). The format of the film is somewhat episodic - a large proportion of the film is made up of segments in which the various characters enter into the waxwork tableaux - and normally this would annoy me, but in this case, each of the episodes (featuring such classic horror villains as vampires, werewolves, the mummy, zombies and the Marquis de Sade) is so well made that I actually found myself looking forward to the next waxwork episode. They're just like something out of an old horror movie, only gorier. What really makes this film stand out, however, is the sub-plot involving the virginal heroine of the story, Sarah (Deborah Foreman), and her fascination with the Marquis de Sade. Traditionally the heroines of horror movies are portrayed as ""good"" and ""innocent"", and for the most part Sarah is. She just happens to have masochistic tendencies. It's something that I haven't seen in a teen-targeted horror film before or since and it is one of the main reasons why I keep coming back to the film (I've seen it three times now)... That and the fact that it's a lot of fun. I strongly recommend this film - 5 stars.

Waxwork II: Continuing on from where ""Waxwork"" left off, when Sarah (Monika Schnarre) is charged with a crime committed by an escaped waxwork, Mark and Sarah must travel through time in order to find evidence that will acquit her.

Not quite as good as the original ""Waxwork"", but still pretty enjoyable. The main drawback of this sequel is Sarah. The character just isn't as interesting as she was in the original, and Monika Schnarre isn't as good in the part as Deborah Foreman. The plot is also pretty weak, but then again, so was that of the original. ""Waxwork II"" is also structured as a series of episodes (each being a different stop on Mark and Sarah's journey through time), with episodes including homages to ""Frankenstein"", ""The Haunting"", ""Alien"", ""Dawn of the Dead"" and other ""classic"" horror movies. The episodes are still pretty gory and darkly funny, and as an added bonus, a lot of ""famous"" actors make small appearances in them. Look out for Bruce Campbell, Maxwell Caulfield, David Carradine and Drew Barrymore (she appears for about five seconds in the ""Nosferatu"" homage).

The first Waxwork movie has a group of college kids going to a very oddly placed waxwork museum at midnight to get a closer look at the waxwork exhibits. Too bad no one told them that the closer look meant literally becoming part of the exhibit! The creepy caretaker has to find a victim for each remaining exhibit so that history's most evil beings can once again live and take over the world. The film is quite literally 80s pulp horror at it's best.

Waxwork II: Lost in Time makes up the 2nd entry to this volume. The survivors of the first film (Mark and Sarah) find themselves needing to save Sarah from the slammer as she's being accused of her stepfather's death. For some strange reason no one believes her story that it was all the zombie hand's fault. As he's exploring his now-deceased godfather's belongings, he discovers a magic necklace that will allow him to travel through time and gather proof that magic exists and zombie hands can kill people. The second volume of Waxworks is... not so great in comparison. Rather than take the route of making a serious film, the creators decided to mix horror with comedy, a combination that so rarely works. However the film gets around this for the most part by refusing to take itself seriously and poking constant fun at itself. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Still, it's pretty fun to watch for the camp value alone, as well as several cameo performances by famous faces, most notably scream king Bruce Campbell.

Overall I'd say the dvd is well worth getting for fans of pulp horror. People who don't appreciate pulp horror would be better off looking elsewhere, although it would be a shame if they didn't at least give this series a try. As far as the DVD extras go, there really aren't any, which would have really pushed this volume to be great & not just merely good.

EDIT:

I'm returning to the scene of the crime to re-review Waxwork II. After the initial dissapointment of the first viewing, I found myself wanting to watch it again for the laughs. Many points of it were just as bad as the first go-round, but I did find several parts of the movie that I absolutely loved. One was Michael Des Barres as the overly campy George, which was one character who stole every scene he was in. The villains of the piece were ultimately more interesting than the good guys, and I have to say that part of me rooted for them deep down inside. I have to say that once I got over the ""OMG, this is so bad"" parts of the film, I enjoyed the movie much more than I did the first time.",1224028800,2,2736,4.474949899799599
1908261,4,B0000ALPFL,"WAXWORK- Zack Galligan (Gremlins) stars as a 19yo rich kid who leads his gang of friends into the local waxwork museum. Said museum is run by the mysterious Mr. Lincoln (David Warner from The Omen and Time After Time), who has evil plans in the works. The wax figures on display are no ordinary attractions. They are actually portals into alternate universes (or something like that) where the vampires, werewolves, mummies, zombies, and other assorted creatures really exist! The teens are each plunged into individual scenarios of almost certain death at the hands (and claws) of these fiends! This is all part of Lincoln's plot to bring forth a monster-driven apocalypse! Gorehnts rejoice! The blood flows and splatters, while the flesh is torn, shredded, and eaten! Patrick Macknee (The Howling) costars. WAXWORK 2- Zack Galligan returns along w/ the only other survivor from film one. Together, with the help of a time-portal key, they must prove that a murder was actually commited by a crawling, disembodied hand, instead of by Galligan's partner. This leads to many further adventures in various horror worlds, including the best part in either movie, where Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead, Bubba Hotep) and Marina Sertis (Star Trek TNG) play paranormal investigators in a haunted house, ala THE HAUNTING. The rest of this sequel can be a bit tedious, w/ occasional bursts of humor. Alexander Godunov (Die Hard, Witness) is okay, but grows tiresome after awhile. WAXWORK 1 and 2 make for an entertaining afternoon (or midnight) fright fest. The goofy '80s hairstyles, fashions, and attitudes are offset nicely by the screwball comedy / grisley slaughter combo...",1217030400,,1664,5.166666666666667
1908262,4,B0000ALPFL,"This is a fun little movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  It belongs more in the ""camp"" than the classic horror category; but if you like campy little b-movies, this one is well worth the price.

A waxwork museum comes to town, and a mysterious man invites some teens to come to a special showing at midnight.  None of the teens are in any great danger of winning an award for acting, but by b-movie standards they aren't too bad.  As each teen is lured into crossing the velvet rope and entering an exhibit, they also step through into the scene that inspired the exhibit.

This conceit provides an excuse to show teenagers ""living out"" scenes from every horror film from Night of the Living Dead to Dracula (with the Wolfman and Mummy thrown in for good measure) . . . and to a surprisingly long ""homage"" to the Marquis De Sade.  The finale involves a gang of ""oldsters"" riding to the rescue led by a wheelchair bound John Steed from the Avengers (or at least the actor who played him.)  At the end of the climatic final battle the waxworks are burned to the ground and the forces of evil vanquished . . . except for one pesky little ambulatory hand.

The sequel picks-up right where the first film ends, but with a different actress in the role of the female lead.  The ""undead"" hand from the first movie kills the stepfather of the female lead, and she is accused of his murder.  Our protagonists have to find evidence to substantiate their alibi/tale of black magic.

This time we are treated to watching our two lead characters wandering through a whole new set of scenes from ""classic horror"" movies:  everything from Frankenstein to Aliens and the Haunting (with a great cameo by Bruce Willis) to the mall scene from Dawn of the Dead.  This double feature is never in any danger of being confused with great cinema, but it is a lot of fun.",1207958400,,1857,4.491071428571429

1908267,4,B0000ALPFL,"I know these movies are a little campy, but I like them. Especially the different scenes of the wax figures and their different story lines. Hollywood could almost make a movie or series about different scary time-travelers every week. The acting is so-so, this movie is a ""drive-in"" type movie. Waxworks 2 is a little deeper than Waxworks 1, but the story is more involved, and the lead character is the same actor. It doesn't explain a lot of little nuances, but then again, it's not Oscar material. If you want a good semi-scary/ funny movie for a Saturday nite, then these two movies would do it. One more thing, there are a few surprise guest actors in the movies, especially Waxworks 2,like David Carradine (of Kill Bill), and Drew Barrymore, among others.",1125187200,4,762,4.7368421052631575

These movies never get old, and there is not so much blood, guts, and gore  but that is not the style of this dynamic duo.  I think any movie that can throw humor, suspence, and a multitude of horror characters is A1 in my book.  Enjoy viewing!",1113609600,2,460,4.2298850574712645

The fun part is that Waxworks II is a direct continuation from the ending of Waxwork, so its like one extended movie with a bit of a cast change.  I saw them a long time ago and enjoyed them.  They are still pretty good, but of course don't look for the same level of special effects.  These were ""B"" movies when new, so they don't match up with today's gore films.  Still it is entertaining enough if you are into the old stuff.",1487289600,,493,4.09375
