8294881,3,B001DTWNP2,"I liked the detailed shore-based instruction for paddle techniques, bottom turns and top turns. HOWEVER, the demonstrations were done with regular footing and then every example that was shown in live action examples was goofy foot, or basically backwards from the demonstrations. That's just terrible editing. Still, the techniques are valid and I think every SUP surfer entering the line up should watch this TWICE.",1497139200,,417,5.430769230769231
8294882,4,B001DTWNP2,Excellent tips for the intermediate to advanced stand-up paddle surfer.  Never thought about using my paddle as a tool to help get to the surface after a wipe out in bigger surf.,1486166400,,178,4.5625
8294883,4,B001DTWNP2,"Very informative. Appreciate the different sections on intermediate to advanced technique, but would have appreciated index to quickly access the different sections.",1437523200,,165,6.545454545454546
8294884,5,B001DTWNP2,"Who better to learn from than the guys that invented to the sport.
True Watermen, the originators, the innovators, the best at what they do.",1377129600,,140,4.64
8294885,5,B001DTWNP2,"When your ready to take your stand up paddle surfing to the next level this is the DVD to have. I'm using the paddle techniques for turning and WOW my board is a looser , completely different board!",1374710400,,198,4.2368421052631575
8294886,5,B001DTWNP2,"I enjoy this DVD on SUP. It covers most of the bases and I use the info on paddle stroke, turns, how to use the paddle when you are surfing (this part is excellent). It has fun shots of all the C4 guys doin' their thing so you can watch the video many times and for the price in Amazon Prime...really a steal!",1321315200,,309,3.9206349206349205
8294887,5,B001DTWNP2,"Ok so I finished watching Vol. 1 which was great for Intermediate; but after Vol2 I am blown away and so amped to get out there and apply what I learnt.

Not only is it well edited with great music but the insruction is detailed and also broken up with travel and action segments in between that helped keep my attention... maybe a few segments that were too advanced for where my riding is but good for riders of a higher level- Big wave charging, tube rides. Racing etc.

Great to see a mixture of some of the top surfers and legend riders from Hawaii (Buzzy Kerbox. Brian Keahulana etc) helping us out.

Definately Get it!",1265068800,2,625,4.370689655172414
