4705494,5,B005HVWW3K,"Best anime series of all effing time. If you don't like DBZ then you are insane. Takes a nice steamy dump on One Piece and a lot of others, actually, all others. You can't go wrong.",1326672000,6,181,4.055555555555555
4705495,3,B005HVWW3K,"This box set contains the first five Dragonball Z movies released from 1989 to 1991: Dead Zone, The World's Strongest, Tree of Might, Lord Slug, and Cooler's Revenge.  All five of these films run roughly an hour long and follow the same formula as in a great evil threatens earth forcing Goku and the gang to risk life and limb defending it.  The solution is usually a Spirit Bomb (Genki Dama).  All of the movies' english versions are remastered with excellent 5.1 channel surround and the option to watch with either the original japanese music or the original english soundtracks. Also included is the original Japanese mono track and English subtitles.  The first 3 films use the updated Funimation dub and not the original Ocean dub, nor is the Ocean dub included.  The visuals also received a noticeable upgrade from past releases and look as good as they likely ever will.  As far as EXTRAS go Funimation offers a handful of trailers you will likely not care much about. Also the Dead Zone movie includes a commentary track by voice actor Chuck Huber (Garlic Jr., Emperor Pilaf, Android 17) and another guy that worked in the ADR department for Dead Zone. It is more silly than informative but it's a nice addition.

I give this release 3 stars because it's as basic a release as they come and the packaging could be better as well. It's still a good product since you get 5 movies for a good price making this an easy purchase for fan and newcomer alike.",1326153600,15,1462,4.621621621621622
4705496,5,B005HVWW3K,"I've had all the ""orange brick"" Dragon Ball Z season boxes for a good while now, but always wanted to get the movies too. I kept putting it off because the single DVDs for all the movies were a bit expensive, especially since I was planning on owning them all at some point. Then I saw these movie packs being released and I jumped at the chance to finally get the movies.

Since I have never owned the DBZ movies, this purchase was a no-brainer for me. The box itself houses the 5 movies in 3 separate slim cases which I thought was a nice touch. No booklets or anything this time, just the movies themselves which is sort of a bummer but not a deal breaker. Quality wise the animation looks crisp and I've enjoyed watching these, most of them for the first time.

I look forward to purchasing the rest of these movie packs.",1324166400,40,825,4.282051282051282
4705497,4,B005HVWW3K,"With another rerelease of the Dragon Ball movies, I finally decided to pick up this set recently, as I've stopped myself from buying them until now in the hope that a better boxset would come along (Because I can't fit that many single standard DVD cases on my shelf!)

Having seen the movies before (quite some time ago now) in other prints, the quality in this set does not seem to suffer at all in comparison to the single-disc releases to come out over the years, despite the fact that four of the five movies on offer here are paired on to two discs - the remastering process here was done well enough, to be sure, and I saw little to no worsening in the overall quality of each movie (though I suppose some may disagree. Please respond, if so!).

Included, as always, is the original Japanese audio, the English dub, and English subtitle stream.

My only gripe with the set is the fact that the three slim-packs, when inside the set set's slipcase, seem to be a little loose... I noticed a little bowing along the edges of the slipcase of my copy. But really, it makes little difference at the end of the day, and for less than $18, this is a great pack, and if you've forgoed picking the movies up (as I did) up until now. You may as well do it now.

One more thing to add too, though it's a small thing. really , is the similarity between the design of this set and that of the season boxes and the DB movie fourpack. It's not an exact match, so they won't make a nice straight line on your collection shelf, but there is some conformity going for them. Which is pleasant, if not particularly necessary.",1323475200,6,1611,4.324503311258278

I am very happy with the audio and digital qualitI.I grew up watching the movies and seen worlds strongest for the first time. A DragonBall Z fan must buy item!!!",1473811200,,339,4.573770491803279
4705573,5,B005HVWW3K,"Reviewing a Dragon Ball Z product is weird...

Basically, here's what you're looking at:

1. The original content itself.
2. The quality of the voice acting.
3. The quality of the overall content.
4. The fact you're writing to other Dragon Ball Z fans.
5. The fact you're writing to people who really don't like Anime but like DBZ.

Its not like reviewing, say, The Simpsons. Its because you know that the voice actors did this with the original crew and that you, the viewer, also understand the cultural content. So, because of that, if you're like me and don't really watch that much Anime, you're not going to get certain things.

I was a big fan of the Original Dragon Ball series, and I always kinda hated Dragon Ball Z. I love DBZ at first, but the series seemed to quickly devolve into a ""ooh, look at how powerful I am!"" contest while the original Dragon Ball was always about amazing stories and fun and the battles were just a part of that. I always wanted the DBZ series to do more of that. Growing up, I had watched ""Tree of Might"", and the only thing I remembered was that it wasn't that good, but I decided to get this set since I was curious.

THIS is everything I wish Dragon Ball Z was!

Its about fun and adventure and going on crazy adventures while having meaningful battles! ""Dead Zone"" was an awesome prequel to the DBZ universe, and ""Tree of Might"".... holy crap, that was insanely awesome! A tree planted on earth that saps the planet, but the pacing, the fights... just great!

Overall, the thing that's great about all of these movies are the pacing and fights! They're not trying to rush through a story, and they're also not trying to rush fights. Instead you have amazing stories that are able to breath with amazing battles mixed in. The American Voice Actors did an amazing job, and I had a good chuckle hearing the voice actor for Goku as a child from the original Dragon Ball series voice Gohun in a few of these movies.

Honestly, you'll feel great seeing these!",1473465600,2,1997,4.467032967032967

This is a great replacement to my previous discs, as the original covers are retained (and apparently upgraded), the remastering makes the film look much better, and the widescreen presentation matches how the movies were originally shown at Shonen Jump festivals in Japan when the movies were coming out.  The only drawback is that the dub isn't very consistent with the original Japanese, but the subtitles for the original version are great and I've enjoyed watching all the movies again for such an efficient price.",1390435200,6,678,4.93859649122807

4705956,4,B005HVWW3K,These are mainly short bursts of Dragonball z that are longer then an episode but aren't really long stories. They don't seem to have any affect on the main story of the episodes of the show. The only one that was really mentioned in the cartoon is Garlic Jr. which is probably the shortest and in my opinion the least interesting in all of the series of movies I've seen so far. If your like me and you want more Dragonball stories and hope these will scratch that itch they well but just know going in that these are not really a continuation or in any way important to the TV series. They are mainly just Goku and company saving the earth from certain destruction.,1387497600,2,667,4.344
4705957,3,B005HVWW3K,"I loved DBZ ever since i was 4 years and was an advid fan. I bought this box set as a way to relive that childhood. Particularly with the movie the tree of might. But one thing i forgot to include in choosing this box set is that the first three movies do not include the original pioneer dub. Which is okay if its your first time watching dbz or its movies. But for me it made the voice acting weak and a bit cheesy. Which really took away the essence of the movie tree of might. (Which i consider the best of the first three DBZ movies) Since i watched it a thousand times i couldn't help but compare how much better the voice acting was in the original dub. So instead of watching the tree of might with same attention, focus, and astonishment i found myself just fast forwarding to the fight scenes. But besides that the quality is really good the audio sounds way better and its definately good for the price.

4705970,4,B005HVWW3K,"I do not believe there is a series in the history of television that is better at manufacturing drama than Dragon Ball Z. If you're a fan of the series you will understand why the characters need to spend lengthy moments at a time staring at each other in anticipation of the upcoming battle. In the case of ""The World's Strongest"" the slow burn of the first half of the film is justified by the 30 minute climax. In Dead Zone however, the action seems to build up to a great battle which never really happens.

With these movies you do get some of the great features of Dragon Ball Z including amazing animation, plenty of things and people getting blown up, blistering fight sequences, plenty of commitment to the plot (even if the plot itself isn't that interesting) and, as I mentioned before, lots of brow-furrowing at each other.

Newcomers who are interested in anime, super powers, aliens and martial arts will find something to enjoy in these movies. At $16 for five movies, it's an inexpensive gift with plenty of chances to please. And even if one movie doesn't grab you, maybe the next four will.",1376352000,2,1108,4.590909090909091

4706018,4,B005HVWW3K,"This is the first of three Dragon Ball Z movie packs that are released. In it contains the first five movie that were released in accordance to the show. As with most of the Dragon Ball Z movies, it's a little difficult to place them in the actual timeline of the show as there are many strange inaccuracies, such as characters are supposed to be dead are alive or some characters aren't even around when apparently they just became part of the main cast (I'm looking at you Vegeta).
Nether the less, I'll go over the details of what movies your getting:

Dead Zone: This first film see's the introduction of Garlic Jr. who is one of the only characters to get an entire saga in the actual series. Garlic Jr. is looking for the seven dragon balls to take over the world. And it's up to Goku to take him down and rescue his son.

The World's Strongest: The Evil Dr. Wheelo is resurrected in android form with the dragon balls. But if he really wants to rule the world, he must seek out the word's strongest warrior to house his brain. Of course, Goku is what Wheelo has in mind.

The Tree of Might: One of my personal favorites in this set, a group of Saiyans and Goku look alike, Turles, arrive on earth to plant the tree of might so that it may bear fruit that would bestow them incredible powers. Expect a lot of fighting in this one and some really good animation.

Lord Slug: Evil Leader Lord Slug crash lands on earth with the intent on terra freezing it to make it more comfortable for themselves, but miserable for everyone else, and then moving on to the next planet. Lord Slug learns about the dragon balls and since he's now hundreds of years old, he plans on wishing for his youth back. Not the most memorable movie, but it's still good nonetheless.

Coolers Revenge: Following the events of Namek's destruction and Freiza's death, Frieza's brother Cooler has intent to destroy Goku and all of his friends. Cooler is twice as strong as Freiza, so it's once again up to Goku to rid the planet of this menace.

Each of these come in 16:9 aspect ratio and will run in total about 4 and a half hours. It contains both funimation english and japanese dialogue. The music is in 5.1 surround sound. The original japanese dialogue is in mono. Also there is included english subtitles.

There aren't really any special features to speak of except for a commentary on Dead Zone with Chuck Huber (Garlic Jr., Emperor Pilaf) and Chris Sabat, who was the ADR director at the time and who would later voice memorable character Vegeta and others. It's very entertaining hearing these two rip into the characters and story (because, really, it's not a story you can take seriously. Certainly not in the DBZ universe) and makes for a good listen.

The packaging comes in 3 slip cases, two disks in two cases with one housed in it's one case. It's a pretty standard outer shell, nothing too interesting or special like the yellow dragon box's.

Overall, this is a pretty bare bones package and was simple transfer into standard dvd format. They did a good job with the remastering, but I really don't like the packaging. The fact that on the back they have at the very top, ""Five thrilling flicks at one amazing price!"" comes off as really lame and stupid. Besides the packaging, this is still a good set and is very worthy of being part of your Dragon Ball Z collection, though I absolutely recommend watching the actual series before these if you haven't already.",1337644800,5,3458,4.52
4706019,5,B005HVWW3K,"I love DragonBall Z since I was little. To have this collection in my procession is amazing to me because for a long time I couldn't find the movies for DBZ. Now that technology has changed since then a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. It a WONDERFUL collection. I just love it. If you are a DBZ fan, you must get it.",1332633600,2,506,3.9223300970873787
4706020,4,B005HVWW3K,"Not 100% true,if you watch the movies in English with Japanese music the original intro song ''Cha-La Head-Cha-La'' was replaced with an instrumental generic Western song that I don't even know the name of and don't care to know it, is awful. And in the movie Dead Zone when Gohan eats the tree fruit and gets high, the song that was supposed to play is the original ''Tenka-ichi Gohan'' with voice, but instead they replaced the original version with a newer instrumental version. They did the same in the World Strongest movie, when Gohan is studying and thinking about Piccolo the original song ''Piccolo-san Dai Suki'' was also replaced with a newer instrumental version. But you can still hear the original versions of these songs if you watch the movies in original Japanese mono.

 In the movies Tree of might and Lord Slug the original intro song doesn't change if you watch the movies in English with Japanese music like in the first two. In the Cooler's Revenge movie they changed the original intro song like in the first 2 movies but at least the main menu has Japanese music instead of that lame generic metal Western crap that they used for the rest of the movies.

-1 star for those reasons, but still a good deal and I got all 3 movie packs.",1329868800,4,1257,4.602678571428571
