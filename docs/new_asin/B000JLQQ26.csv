2675779,4,B000JLQQ26,"Will Rogers was a prominent figure in radio and in the movies. He often talked politics, a relevant topic in the Depression years, but always managed to spin the discussions with a bit of humor. His ""hometown folk"" personality won him plenty of favor with the public, and despite his plain appearance and less-than-polished grammer, he was a top star. Unfortunately, he met an early end in a plane crash in 1935.

The first movie in this set is a short and fun one. Ambassador Bill shows off all of the charms of the legendary Rogers with great ease. His trademark personality brings about plenty of humor in the film. There is nothing really important in this movie, but it is an enjoyable way to pass the time. Bill Harper (Rogers) is the US Ambassador to Sylvania, a troubled country in the midst of a revolution. The former ambassador has suffered a nervous breakdown, so the US sends Bill to take over the job. The elite in Sylvania are corrupt individuals intent on taking power, and Bill is an unwanted foil to their plans. The young king (Tad Alexander) quickly takes to Ambassador Bill; the two play baseball together. The queen (Marguerite Churchill) appreciates his efforts to reunite her with the abdicated king (Ray Milland), although she fights the reconciliation. Although Bill's manners do not mesh well in Sylvania, he charms many people there, and the powerful abhor him. To get rid of him once and for all, they plant a beautiful young girl (Greta Nissen) in his room and hope for the best.

Too Busy To Work is the best film of the lot, an excellent example of just how good Rogers could be. Here he plays Jubilo, a man who roams the world and refuses to work. His life's ambition is to find the man that charmed his wife away from him while he was away at war. Finally, after years of searching, he stumbles upon the house of his enemy. There, he gets a job as a farmhand at the insistance of his daughter (Marian Nixon) who does not recognize him. (After all, she was only a baby when her mother re-married, and her mother is dead now.) Jubilo decides not to tell her the truth, but he does his best to ensure her happiness. When her boyfriend (Dick Powell) gets mixed up in a crime ring, Jubilo does his best to get him out. The entire cast is excellent here and each perform to the best of their abilities. The story is sentimental and sweet, a treat to watch many times over.

Mr. Skitch is your typical Depression era story, although the film is quite rare. Usually, Hollywood avoided such sad topics and moved on to a lighter fare, but Rogers' popularity as an average man made it possible for audiences to connect happily to the character. As a result, this film features events very much like The Grapes of Wrath, but instead presents them lightheartedly and ends happily. The Skitch family has been uprooted; the local bank has foreclosed and lost off of the family's money. Unhappily, the gang packs up into their car, and makes way for California, the land of dreams. Mr. Skitch (Rogers) is in charge, Mrs. Skitch (Zasu Pitts) takes care of the food and the children, the twins Winnie and Minnie (or is it Minnie and Winnie?) describe every location they visit like travelling Encyclopedias, Little Ira (Wally Albright) questions the validity of everything, and Emily (Rochelle Hudson) falls in love. Lots of minor events occur, but the general feeling is of optimism in spite of the desperate times.

David Harem is the weakest entry. It concerns Rogers as a horse trader who constantly tries to trick the local Deacon (Charles Middleton) into getting a bad deal. David gets tricked instead, and winds up with a tempermental horse that won't move unless he is sung to. Trying to make the best of a bad situation, David enters him into a race, hoping he has stumbled onto something special. Stepin Fetchit appears as a stable hand, and although he is normally a pretty good comic underneath the racial stereotypes, here he is more embarassing than anything.

Overall, this is a worthwhile set to have to experience the talents of a forgotten star. Also included is a booklet with information on all four films which come with cards for their scene selection menus.",1205020800,8,4196,4.657219973009447
2675780,3,B000JLQQ26,"In less than a year's time we've gotten TWO Will Rogers movie collections, so it seems a bit petty to complain, but--couldn't the titles have been selected a bit more judiciously for Vol. 2? If the plan is to release all the Rogers talkies, fine; but if we're only to get a few of these boxed sets, let's get serious: ""Mr. Skitch?"" It has a fine cast, some funny moments, a rattle-trap excuse of a plot, and production values so cheap you can hear the pennies jingling--both of 'em.

""Too Busy to Work,"" a drama with comedy highlights, will bemuse anyone who doesn't appreciate that Rogers played the ""Jubilo"" character in several movies throughout his career, this movie being the culmination and apothesis of them all, right down to the little jig step in Jubilo's stride. ""David Harum"" has as much sentiment but even more comedy and is a lot of fun to watch, no matter what your opinion of Stepin Fetchit.

""Ambassador Bill"" weaves uneasily between sentimental comedy and broader, ""Duck Soup""-style political satire that finally (and thankfully) predominates in the last third of the movie.

As with Volume 1, there are some good extra features included, the most interesting being the ""He Chews to Talk"" featurette with the famous ""unemployment relief"" speech. Any Rogers collection is better than none, but if we're only going to get one or two more of these, let's do Will proud and collect ""Dr. Bull,"" ""Judge Priest,"" ""The County Chairman,"" and ""State Fair.""",1169251200,17,1465,4.852
2675829,5,B000JLQQ26,"Very good collection of Will Rogers.  My family and friends have thoroughly enjoyed this.
Thanks for providing variety products.",1409356800,,128,5.7368421052631575
2675830,3,B000JLQQ26,"Here are some of the major contents of the box set:

""Too Busy to Work""
------------------
Here's the plot of this 1932 comedy:  Will Rogers lost his wife to another man during World War I, and he's generally allergic to work.  As the film begins he is living a hobo's life.  ""Jubilo"" is his handle.  He hitched train rides to California, hoping to catch a glimpse of the daughter he last saw when she was two years old.

Sprinkle in a bank robbery and two young people in love.  It's a plain-Jane plot, but it included some nice emotional moments when Rogers met his daughter without revealing his identify, and when he confronted the man his wife married, ""Judge Hardy.""

Even though her role played to the dramatic stereotypes of the era, Louise Beavers gave a sprightly performance as the Judge's African-American housekeeper.  When Will Rogers and his screen daughter sang the old Henry Clay Work song, ""Kingdom Coming [in the year of Jubilo],"" they use the old words.  Even so, Will Rogers showed cheer and good will toward all.

Rogers brought his gentle humor to every scene, and it's agreeable to see how in the 1930s laughs did not depend on profanity or sex.

""He Chews to Talk""
----------------
The ""Too Busy to Work"" DVD includes a 1931 special feature, ""He Chews to Talk.""  Don't let the title fool you.  It's a newsreel film of Rogers giving a 10-minute speech for President Hoover's Organization for Unemployment Relief.  It's sometimes called the ""unemployment relief"" or the ""bacon and beans and limousines"" speech.  You can find the transcript on the web, but it's a richer experience watching Rogers in front of the microphone.  It comes across as off-the-cuff remarks with large doses of humor, but those who write speeches will want to study it for organization and delivery.  Rogers hit his stride when he spoke of the need for jobs and income support in the midst of American abundance, so it also provides food for thought on our current economic difficulties.  There's a lot to learn about public appeals, and a lot to mull about policy, in these 10 minutes of remarks.  And yes, Rogers was chewing gum during the speech.

""Mr. Skitch""
----------
It's the gentle good humor of Will Rogers that carries this 1933 film of a family on the move through the American west after they lose their Missouri home to foreclosure.

Among the 23 ""talkies"" made by Rogers, ""Mr. Skitch"" is not at the top of any list.  The supporting cast is lackluster, the plot less than compelling, the romance unconvincing.  Every film has its moments, however, and along with the star's homespun humor, I enjoyed seeing how travelers lodged in ""auto camps"" in the national parks in the 1930s.

""Ropin' Fool""
-----------
A good reason to put the ""Mr. Skitch"" DVD in the player is to see the bonus feature, the B&W short ""Ropin' Fool,"" made in 1922 using the new slow-motion photography.  It shows cowboy Will Rogers performing the roping tricks that made him a Broadway star and set him on the path to Hollywood.  Some of them are quite ""wow""!

2675831,5,B000JLQQ26,"I couldn't wait to watch my movies once I received them.  i just LOVE old Will Rogers movies.  There is so much common sense in them yet back then, you could laugh at yourself or others without it being taken as a belittling gesture.  You have to be able to laugh at your humanity in order to get through this life successfully; not thinking too highly of yourself.  Nowadays in this great nation, no one can be a loser...no one is taught how to.  That's why I like old movies.  That's how we should live.",1364083200,4,505,4.2631578947368425
2675832,4,B000JLQQ26,"America's beloved cowboy-philospher Will Rogers is remembered today for a few famous comments on American life and public affairs: ""I never met a man I didn't like"" and ""I'm not a member of any organized political party: I'm a Democrat."" But he is largely forgotten in the medium where others live forever and where he too excelled -- as movie star.  With a silent film career dating back to 1919, the former Ziegfield Follies trick-rope star hit his stride in the talkies after he turned 50, becoming a box office sensation for Fox Films in the early 1930s. Perhaps this long neglect is changing, for the same loving care and detail which went into this series' first volume of four DVDs is once again evident here.  Each film is wonderfully remastered, and presented in a colorful slipcase with includes an informative note booklet.

Viewers will pick their own favorites in this set.  The first set was a slightly stronger collection, but my personal favorite here is Ambassador Bill, where Rogers, as U.S. Ambassador to war-torn Sylvania (did the Marx Brothers get some ideas here for their later Duck Soup?) does his best acting of either set alongside a very young Ray Milland. Too Busy To Work, offering far fewer laughs, is a poignant film in which Rogers plays a lovable hobo who comes to the aid of youthful Dick Powell.  David Harum co-stars Charles Middleton, ""Merciless Ming"" of the later Flash Gordon serials, as an 1890s church deacon (!), and Mr. Skitch, though no great shakes as a film, nevertheless features the lovable scatterbrain Zasu Pitts and handsome Charles Starrett, later a B-Western star.",1339372800,,1617,4.886861313868613
2675833,5,B000JLQQ26,"Some people may object to some scenes...that is the way It was.
Rogers was the grandson of a Cherokee Indian who walked from Alabama to Oklahoma..the great Trail of Tears.
Native Americans who had all of their rights taken from them...and many killed by the US Army.  Worse than slaves.  Slaves of the government.
He rose from that to be one of the Great American Legends.
His movies gave us an opportunity to see a reflection of those days....and his acting..and personality were as he was.
You had to be there to really know of those years.  We were poor and thought everyone was....so..we did not know we were poor..
He inspired many.... and the lifestyle of today is not better....  Great movies....great stories...great presentation of history.
I interviewed Jesse Owens on TV not many years before he died.  He was from Alabama....and as he said....You have to run...to work.
The young people want everything given to them.  His (Jesse Owens) words.

Rogers adlibbed many of the words...which were as he spoke and lived and his doubts about politicians.",1297123200,,1059,4.88268156424581
2675834,4,B000JLQQ26,"This review is for ""Too Busy to Work"". I have not yet seen the other films in this set. Although this film is not a masterpiece, it provides an insightful picture into the worst year of the Depression. Will Rogers plays a hobo whose wife remarried when he was in WWI, consequently estranging him from his baby daughter. Fifteen years later, he comes upon his now dead wife's new husband (a senator) and his now grown daughter, who live in a lovely home in the country. The odd part in this picture is the way Will Rogers' character is shown as a slacker who really does not want to work. He's happy to be a hobo, finding handouts where he can. I think Rogers might be parodying the plight of the unemployed man in 1932, perhaps saying that it has been so long since they've been employed, they no longer want to work. The film has many comic moments, especially a scene where Will Rogers tries to milk a cow. His understated style of acting is a pleasure to watch. The film is also notable in that it features Dick Powell in a small role as Rogers' daughter's love interest. Although the film is a comedy, the ending is a little sad as it shows Will Rogers walking alone down a country path with nowhere to go. I'd recommend this film especially to fans of early 30s film. It's still in the awkward stage where pacing ad flow are concerned, as were many early 1930s films, but by virtue of its being a Will Rogers movie, it is worth watching!",1295308800,,1442,4.344444444444444
2675835,5,B000JLQQ26,"The Will Rogers collection seems to be going in reverse; volume 1 highlights his last 4 films he made before his tragic death. Volume 2 continues to explain why Rogers' appeal was so universal, and why he became one of the top box office stars in the Thirties.
""Ambassador Bill"" (1931) is an early Rogers vehicle as he plays the title role. Sent to a foreign country and at first, shocking the officials with his down-home diplomacy & etiquette, he then teaches its boy-king how to be a regular boy. The friendship between Rogers & the boy-king is quite touching, Rogers briefly shows off his rope tricks, and even a young Ray Milland is in the cast! ""Too Busy To Work"" (1932) has Rogers re-prising the role of Jubilo the bum, which he first played in the silent era. It's a balance of comedy & drama as Rogers plays a seemingly ineffectual & ""lazy"" drifter who winds up affecting everyone around him. Its closing shot of Rogers strolling down a country road to his next adventure is strikingly reminiscent of Chaplin's ending in ""Modern Times"". ""Mr. Skitch"" (1933) begins with echoes of the Depression era as Rogers & family lose their their home, load up the jalopy, and travel from Missouri to California to start over. This gives Rogers opportunity to converse with several interesting characters en route. ""David Harum"" (1934) has Rogers at his eccentric best as a bank owner/horse trader who affects the lives of a new bank employee & his object of affections during the 1890's. Its climax is memorable as Rogers discovers his horse loves song during a harness race, and before you know it, the entire crowd is singing along!
What's so enchanting about these films is that all Rogers had to do is play himself, while everything else took a back seat or just coasted along. Rogers didn't have to do broad humor to get laughs; all he had to do was drawl one of his humorous observations & hang his head in shyness, and an audience was hooked.
A wonderful talent is thankfully preserved on DVD...and I'm sure glad to have ""met"" him!",1250035200,4,2035,4.655555555555556
