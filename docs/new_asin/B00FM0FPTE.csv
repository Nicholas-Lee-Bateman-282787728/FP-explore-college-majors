8616785,5,B00FM0FPTE,"The Song of Norway is a good movie. I remember when it first came out, my parents going to see it. They were fascinated with the breath taking scenery and the beautiful singing.  Coming from a European background you can really appreciate it .",1413763200,,243,4.5227272727272725
8616786,1,B00FM0FPTE,The quality of de DVD is bad. It seems like a bad VHS recording. I regret to have paid so much money for this.,1392681600,,110,3.625
8616787,3,B00FM0FPTE,"The U.S. release of this DVD is currently an absurd $205. How surprised I was to see the Portuguese import for $27. The entire musical is in English with optional Portuguese subtitles and it works on U.S. DVD players. In all respects this is a very charming musical designed to showcase beautiful Norway and the music of Grieg. This is loosely based on the Forest and Wright musical, but that's OK. The film took some of the best songs from the musical and added some very nice segments showcasing Grieg's classical music and songs. I grew up with the 1940s Broadway recording with Kitty Carlisle in the lead role; Florence Henderson does a fine job but is not as operatic as either the Broadway or fine London 2 disk studio recording. The individual playing Grieg cannot sing, but that is forgivable since he is charming in the lead role. The other roles appear dubbed but Grieg's friend is a reasonable operatic tenor. The scenery is of course gorgeous, but here is the problem: the transfer to DVD is poor low-resolution (sometimes muddy or blurry) and looks like early VHS and the sound appears to be 2 channel stereo. Let's hope this movie gets remastered into DTS 5.1 Blu-ray. Right now this is the only affordable solution.",1391990400,4,1230,4.699074074074074
