1692279,4,B000063V8N,"I bought this for my three year old daughter because I am a sucker for Disney movies.  By the time I decide I want a particular Disney movie they take it off the market so now I pretty much buy what ever they dish out which seems to be at the rate of once a month.  I figure even a bad Disney movie is still better than most of the cartoons out there.  I didn't have extremely high expectations for this movie but it was actually better than I thought it would be.  I had a few chuckle moments watching it.  My daughter liked it enough to watch it for stretches at a time.  The story centers on Tarzan and Jane's one year anniversary.  As Jane tries to think of what would be the best gift for Tarzan, she and the other characters remember incidents over the past year.  My favorite was when Jane's friends came to visit her from England.  There was definitly some adult humor as the riends admired Tarzan's body. The rest of the movie was basically Tarzan rescuing Jane from one dire predicament or another.  I thought the scenes where Jane's ex boyfriend comes to visit were a little on the viloent side for a Disney movie.  There is an intense airplane fight in the air with gunfire and the ex boyfrind aims a gun at Tarzan and Jane.  I thought Disney movies were supposed to be on the less violent side.  I think little girls will like the scenes with Jane and the animals but I think that some of the action sequences were geared more towards older kids mainly boys who would like movies such as Atlantis.  Despite the shortcommings of the movie it was still nice to catch up and visit with Tarzan and Jane.  I didn't think too much of the bonus activities on the dvd.  I tried to do the build your own treehouse but was told that I wasn't very good at it by Jane's dad.  It seemed boring anyway.  The bit with Mandy Moore talking about her song was really annoying.  Mandy has this to say about her song ""I don't have to be Mandy Moore when I sing. I can I be a Disney Character, it's so liberating""  or some shmaltz like that.  If you can sit through it without wanting to toss your cookies more power to you.",1027555200,,2116,4.2269326683291775

I like this Jane's Voice better than Minnie Driver, her voice is not that annoying. NO MUSIC WHAT SO EVER IN THIS FILM! Only a snip of Two worlds with Mandy More for the Main Title and than a dork Finale song and than the End Title that is it! They took once again 3 stories and made it into a second movie! VERY CRAPY ANIMATION! My 3 year old niece could have drawn better! O, I am sorry, Disney is losing it's touch of magic! I bought this on DVD because I thought at least the extras would have been good but they are even worse! Mandy Moore is in there for a snip and that is it!

About the movie:  The movie has the characters that you'd expect.  Unfortunately, you can tell that Tarzan and Janes animation was done differently than what you've seen in the first Tarzan movie.

Golden Films
Cartoon
 Children might enjoy this film. There is lots of singing, but neither the art, singing, plot, nor characters are as much fun as the Disney version. There are small differences in the story line from other films. Lord Greystock and his pregnant wife are set adrift by the sailors on a sinking ship and are washed ashore to the jungle. Tarzan is soon born and his parents die of a jungle fever. An ape raises him as a son. Her other son, his brother, keeps trying to harm him. He is at first not accepted by the other apes, especially the ape leader. Jane and her parents are washed ashore. She and Tarzan start a romance, but she leaves for Baltimore to marry a man who has money because her father needs money.",1314835200,,751,4.364285714285714
1692467,3,B000063V8N,"Disney's ""Tarzan and Jane"" is not a real direct-to-video feature sequel to their fantastic theatrical release, ""Tarzan"" (for something more along those lines, check out the somewhat excellent midquel, ""Tarzan 2""). Instead, ""Tarzan and Jane"" is deviously packaged and sold as an all new feature, but it is not. Not really. This is the key factor you must know when considering to purchase ""Tarzan and Jane"". What is it really? Well, have you ever seen those special episodes of old sitcoms in which the characters just reminisce about past episodes? They're called ""clip shows"". Well, like a handful of other films released direct-to-video by Disney, ""Tarzan and Jane"" is one of those releases that is similar to watching a clip show, but instead of clips, we're getting flashbacks to full episodes of the Disney animated television show ""The Legend of Tarzan"", a series based on their animated feature but which was less easy to find during its TV run than most of their other animated shows. I did manage to catch a few episodes though, and if memory serves, it was pretty good, but I don't think the three episodes on this disc represent the ""Best Of"".

Instead of serving children and adult fans together by releasing the ""The Legend of Tarzan"" animated series in a complete series set, Disney got greedy again here and went for the babysitter buck, linking three so-so episodes that aren't connected at all with a weak wraparound story of Jane trying to figure out how best to celebrate her first anniversary of marriage to Tarzan. It definitely brings to mind the old ""Hercules: Zero to Hero"" release that has since only come out on VHS and was exactly the same sort of presentation we are getting here instead of a truly new sequel. The wraparound animation, once again, is sub par, though probably better than what we saw in Herc's release. Luckily, the actual TV episodes that provide the bulk of the ""feature"" presentation are slightly better at typical Disney television animation levels. The leaf shadow effect used can be a bit annoying at times though. The voicing in the episodes sounds better than the wraparound material too, though none of the original cast returned for the TV series. The three episodes from the show we get in this flashback format are ""Tarzan and the British Invasion"", ""Tarzan and the Volcanic Diamond Mine"" and ""Tarzan and the Flying Ace"". British Invasion tells of 3 old friends of Jane coming to visit and being shocked and appalled at her new, wild lifestyle and wildman husband. Volcanic Diamond Mine is about two greedy men who come to the jungle in search of diamonds and who hire Tarzan as a guide. The Flying Ace is about another old friend of Jane's coming to visit, this time a male. Tarzan distrusts him but worries his feelings might be clouded by jealousy. All three tales are just ""okay"" stories, and it would seem the only link between them is an almost secondary focus on Tarzan's desire to please Jane and be a good husband. A negative in grouping these particular stories are the similarities between them, some of which I won't mention because they'd seem like spoilers.

The overall DVD is decent, enhanced widescreen and all that (though, now that I think about it, that probably means the TV show segments have been cropped, ugh), and it includes Fast Play and 3 extras. Proving this DVD was just aimed at the ""just buy it to entertain your kids"" audience and not a wider scale of Disney or Tarzan fans, the 3 bonus features are a ""choose your own adventure"" type Tarzan story, a build a treehouse game, and a weak behind the scenes look at Mandy Moore's recording of the forgettable original song for this film, ""Singing to the Song of Life"". I thought at least I was getting a Mandy Moore video here, but it's just some blasting of the song with bits of Mandy breaking in and talking about it here and there, so not even a proper music video is included. It's too bad the bonus features didn't also include some bonus TV show episodes (but that might have given away the big secret?) or at least some classic Disney shorts, but what can you expect on a release such as this. Bottom line, it's our only way to get any episodes (even if they're not the best) of the Tarzan animated series right now, so a hardcore Disney fanatic like myself pretty much has to get this for his/her collection. BUT, Disney, please, knock off this packaging episodes as an original movie crap. It does not reflect well on you, and it's definitely PART of the reason Disney direct-to-video releases got such a bad reputation over the years (which is too bad, because there ARE some good ones out there). Stop sitting on your television shows and give them proper releases, and follow through. You were on the right track for a while there with DuckTales, TaleSpin, Darkwing, Rescue Rangers, the Gummi Bears, Gargoyles, and Lizzie McGuire, but you couldn't finish releasing even ONE of those shows? What's up with that? Much less popular shows get full releases from other studios. Give a little back to your fans and the public opinion of the Disney Company will start to go up again. It's not really a great idea to alienate your most hardcore fans just to please the masses. The hardcore fans are the ones who really keep you alive in the public consciousness when you need it the most. And I'm not letting the consumer off the hook here either. People, in this information age, stop buying DVDs you know NOTHING about and then complaining about them. Do a little research before you drop a 20 on a new movie if you're the type to get very upset if you're not pleased. I say this for YOUR benefit, not just because I hate to read clueless reviews. Anyway, 3 stars out of 5 because the show was a good show, and one way or another, you at least get three episodes of it out of this DVD.",1308528000,,5828,4.640851887705711

She talks with Terkina and Tantor, later on her father joins in on the discussion, and they all recall flashbacks on how things went wrong. The flashbacks are episodes taken from the television show The Legend of Tarzan. The three episodes are:  ""Tarzan and the British Invasion"", ""Tarzan and the Volcanic Diamond Mine"" and ""Tarzan and the Flying Ace"". In the end Tarzan turns the tables on Jane by giving her a diamond wedding ring, a surprise party, and wearing his father's suit.

My eight-year-old cousin fell asleep in this, so I'm sure that I'm not the only one thinking the way I do.

Nothing too exciting, heartbreaking, wonderful, or anything that falls into that catergory ever happens in this movie.

The original is great.  What this is is three cartoon episodes from the Disney Tarzan television program.  The action animation is not nearly as good as in the movie (e.g., the physics of the swinging through the jungle is poor).  The plots are terrible/slow/painful.  For example, Jane's ditzy girl friends come from London and get chased all day by panthers that never get around to eating them, despite endless chances.  It also contains much more gratutious violence. Having said all that, my four year-old seems to like it as well as well as she did the full length animation; thus the third star.",1062288000,19,771,4.708955223880597
1692550,1,B000063V8N,"I'm SO glad this pathetic, painfully boring ""movie"" has an overall rating of only 2 stars. If I could give it 0, believe me, I would. This movie is ANYTHING but cool. It is a sad and sorry disaster that was plainly done only to cheat Disney-loving saps out of their good, hard-earned money. This worthless piece of junk belongs in the trash or under a nice cold beverage glass as a coaster. I had NO fun watching this film; the entire time I wished it only to end, and as soon as possible! ""Cinderella II"" was INFINITELY better than this!! At least there the animation was decent, it had HUMOR, and there were some multi-dimensional characters with clear messages. This movie is just plain stupid.
The animation and voice talent are HORRIBLE through and through. It is nothing more than three particularly bad Saturday morning cartoon episodes mashed together incoherently and labeled as a ""sequel."" This is by far THE WORST Disney sequel to date, and I cannot stress that enough! Please don't subject yourself to the torture by watching it, it will only sicken you. It's almost impossible to believe that the Disney studios who produced spectacular old movies like ""Beauty & the Beast,"" ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Lady & the Tramp,"" and countless others could be the same Disney studios who sunk so low as to churn out this dull, soulless piece of garbage.
If, even after reading all this, you STILL make the mistake of buying it on DVD, be warned! Do NOT under any circumstances watch the Special Features. Mandy Moore's cornball claims to be ""expressing herself as a character when she sings the song for a Disney movie,"" or some such fluffed-up nonsense about always wanting to be a Disney character will make you gag. Not only is the song she sings mortifyingly awful, it only plays softly in the background during the final scene: meaning she can hardly be heard. So much for dreaming of a role in a Disney film. She sure picked a winner to be in. (Note the sarcasm. If I actually meant this movie was a winner, I'd be checking myself into a mental hospital right now. I know good movies. This is not one of them.)
Sound too extreme a ""bad review"" for a kids' movie? Nah. Not to a 16-year-old who will love animation forever and ever. Why do they have to go and spoil it like this? Not as though the original ""Tarzan"" was anything great, either. Tarzan himself isn't exactly an endearing ape-man with his fake-looking hair and square-ish knuckles (a predecessor to the ridiculously angular ones found in ""Atlantis,"" which was a good movie otherwise?). And as for Jane....well, let's put it this way. It BAFFLES me as to how anyone could like her. She is flattest & most pitiful (not to mention irritating) of the Disney women.
So there you have it, my opinion of ""Tarzan & Jane."" I'm telling you, I clearly don't recommend it. If I were you, I wouldn't buy it. But since I'm not you, I DID make the mistake of buying it. And now I'm telling you: You shouldn't buy it! Unless you really, really want to. But that would mean you like really, really bad movies.",1061164800,14,3071,4.595628415300546
1692551,1,B000063V8N,"TARZAN AND JANE - is a movie that sorely needed viable story. It was obviously intended for very young kids. There is nothing for the adults in this movie. Even the voice characterizations are week and seemed to be forced in comparison to the original. None of the original actors came back to do their voice - and I know why now that I have seen it. It has three very week stories written in the Narrative format. Meaning, these are past adventures told by the animal characters like - ""Remember when Tarzan did this?"" and ""Remember when Jane did this?"" Extremely week and cheap plot devices.
Don't get me wrong, Return To Neverland (the sequel to Peter Pan), Alladins' two sequels and even Pocahantas' sequel were. All were direct-to-video, but still entertaining for the young and old alike.
Stay away from this one. Even the DVD extras are not that interesting. What were they thinking? Didn't anyone read the script? And Michael Eisner approved this? Yikes! (12-9-02)",1040515200,20,972,4.791666666666667

Most times, movies that are directed to video and dvd are Not Rated. As the movie opens, Jane (Olivia d'Abo) and Tarzan (Michael T. Weiss) have been married for a year. And Jane is trying to decide on how to celbrate, she first decides a party, but Tarzan's friends Trek (April Winchell) and Tantor (Jim Cummings) both reject that idea, and reminds her on the time her friends from England, thought she needed saving in the jungle. The Dvd box and disc lists the running time for this movie as approx. 70 minutes. And I think it is also listed on the video box and the tape. But this movie really runs 75 minutes and not 70 minutes. So that way if you watch the movie, you won't think it runs about 70 mintues (in less you haven't read this review).

Where this movie falls short is in the simple fact that it has drawn together 3 separate episodes of the tv show by imposing the slightest plot structure around it all.  I guess they were hoping for a lot of buys from parents who figured it would be of the quality of the first film.  I'm not a huge fan of children's movies, but even I enjoyed the first film.  The music fit with the picture, and the story was well-paced and fun.  This attempt lacks all of those qualities.  It seems like a typical opportunity to reel in a little cash from the overly trusting public.  Trust me.  Don't buy it.

I can't recommend this DVD unless your kids haven't seen the Tarzan cartoon show, as all 3 of the mini-stories in this movie were taken from that. Also, the artwork is NOT Disney quality, it's very low budget artwork/animation. Also, the voices are horrible. I think the only original voice is Tantor's (the elephant). What a waste.

I realize the format and other stuff (that's mentioned in other reviews) cannot be compared to the original Tarzan -- and I think you have to begin watching the movie realizing that (if you want to enjoy it). If you are expecting the movie to be on the same level (artistically and intellectually) as the first you *will* be dissapointed. But if you watch the movie understanding that it lacks the professionalism (I'm hoping that's a real word?) of the first and that you can't really compare the two -- you'll probably enjoy it. Because it *is* cute.
So, basically I liked it. (I'm giving it 5 stars instead of 4 because I feel so bad for it, I mean it deserves more than an average of 2 starts! :o( ) And, as I think was mentioned, the extra features (especially the 'Choose Your Own Adventure' game/ story/ part) were REALLY REALLY REALLY cool.

Oak leaves in a jungle?? The storyline is so-so... 3 episodes of ""remember what happened when...?""  Actor's voices, except for Tantor and Prof. Porter, sound nowhere near the original's.

1692665,2,B000063V8N,"I have mixed feelings about Disney's series of direct-to-video sequels to its animated features. On the plus side, it's good training for their animators.
But CINDERELLA II was awful. HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME II was okay (the original voices is a big plus). I think the most succesful was LADY AND THE TRAMP II - even though the voices of the established characters were atrocious and Lady is reduced to a bit part.
TARZAN & JANE is strung together from episodes of the syndicated television cartoon, with new connecting material. Oddly the DVD, at least, is in a widescreen format .
The special edition DVD of Disney's TARZAN goes to great lengths to discuss the care and work that went into its making. But nothing of that scale is here. None of the voices are voiced by the original actors. The character of Tantor sounds like Wayne Knight, but his name is absent from the credits so I can only surmise it is the work of the talented mimic Jim Cummings - who is credited.
When the original Disney's TARZAN was in theaters director Spike Lee complained of the absence of black characters. My take was that Tarzan's presence in this isolated part of the jungle was a fluke, and he had seen no people before - neither black nor white. But here it seems everybody who knew Jane in England shows up, plus there is a regular ship captain and a man who runs a local trading post - all are white.
There are many other discrepancies with the original film - many things are just out of character.
TARZAN & JANE is getting a heavy advertsiing push with national TV ads and billboards in major cities. Yet a legitimate Disney animated feature was released to DVD (for the first time) and home video the very same day with no fanfare whatsoever. That film is the much superior THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE. So it seems Disney 's main interest in these video sequels is sales - just more ""product"" - not quality.
Ultimately, I feel Disney does itself no favor by cheapening its precious legacy with these cheap knock-offs.",1028073600,,2008,4.580555555555556

My 5 & 6 year did enjoy the movie, but considering we do not have cable nor an antennae, anything animated on the ""TV"" is all good in their eyes.

The voices seemed a little off as well as the rest of the animation.  The format was much the same as Cinderella II as she reflects back on the past year, so there was not even a great deal of originality here.  I remember Disney movies as a child were classics, but it seems that after Disney died, all they care about is how many movies they can churn out each year without any care for content or quality.

1692668,3,B000063V8N,"This Direct To Video ""sequel"" is really just three episodes of ""The Legend Of Tarzan"" TV series, with a new wrap around story. The final result could be considered acceptable IF you understand what it is you are getting.
""Tarzan & Jane"" looks exactly as you would expect a TV cartoon to look like, so you will not be getting any of the spectacular deep canvas animation used on the 1999 original. You won't even get animation that is better than ""Cinderella II: Dreams Come True"", but on par with ""The Hunchback Of Notre Dame II"".  It easy not to be judgemental on the quality, or at least easier. This is because it is not an original production like the other DTV sequels in where the film makers claim that they try to make the sequel look like the original.
The story, has flaws, but it doesn't matter for the kids. They will love it no matter what.
Voice actors are matched close enough to the orginal. With the exception of Terk and sometimes Jane. The replacements of Terk (the ape) does not sound at all like Rosie O'Donnell's take on the character. While Jane does sound like Minnie Driver at times, but some times goes off track a little bit.
Over all, I'd say this one is better for parents to sit through than Cinderella II or The Hunchback II. Kid's will not care that the quality is not the same as the extroadinary original, adults may. Your call....",1027900800,2,1365,4.46

While the big screen ani-epic gave us fresh cel animation (courtesy of Glenn Keane's dynamic pencil), this video draws upon the television cash cow for it's 'inspiration' and fails to deliver the goods in terms of quality artwork or story development.
The result is an awkward series of flashbacks marking the 'adventures' of the couple's first year of wedded bliss.
