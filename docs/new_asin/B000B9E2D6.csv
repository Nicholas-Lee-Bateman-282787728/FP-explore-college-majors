8083922,4,B000B9E2D6,"Theresienstadt was not an extermination camp, but that does not mean the inmates in this camp had it easy. Starvation was rampant, as was disease, and the Nazis used Terezin (as it was also known) as a ""model"" camp, deceiving people into believing that the Jews were not so badly treated after all, the worst deception being perpetrated in front of the Red Cross when they visited the camp during the war. Many of the inmates were eventually selected for deportation to the death camps, including women and children. The most interesting aspect of this film (for me) was the rare archival film footage of the camp and its inmates. There is also footage of German propaganda films of the period. Included is compelling testimony by survivors of the camp. Recommended.",1267920000,13,766,4.854961832061068
8083923,1,B000B9E2D6,"Have not read the book, but in the brief review the date 1941 was given for the Red Cross visit. The actual date was June 1944. In 1941 the camp was just being converted to a concentration camp and there were pratically no prisoners at that time so naturally the Red Cross would not find any intolerable conditions as existed in fact in 1944. These facts are irrefutable. I know because I am a survivor of Theresienstad.",1256428800,18,420,4.467532467532467
8083924,5,B000B9E2D6,Enjoyed learning but found it to be very emotional. Having bee on tour of the Concentration camps in Poland Two years ago revived memories of disguist at Nazi Germany and the lack of interest the rest of the world showd during this muderous period,1180051200,15,247,4.636363636363637
