On a different topic, is anyone ever going to release more seasons of Silver Spoons? Please help me complete my collection of childhood favorites Shout Factory!!",1517788800,,288,5.260869565217392

4470532,4,B002OOWLBG,"This 1984-85 Season is when Kimberly Drummond (Dana Plato) departed the show, and moved to Europe, as well as the season when Maggie McKinney (Dixie Carter) and her son Sam McKinney (Danny Cooksey)became permanent co-stars on the show, along with the fact that this was also the last season that DIFFERENT STROKES was on NBC, before it was moved to ABC in the Autumn of 1985.

This season also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch DIFFERENT STROKES right before GIMME A BREAK every Saturday night on NBC.
Additionally, this DVD box set let's you watch all these episodes complete and uncut without all those butchered scenes you'd get in reruns on TV Land, TNN, BET, Antenna-TV, and now Me-TV.",1515369600,6,709,4.672
4470533,5,B002OOWLBG,Shout factory has been incredible at picking up series where Sony left off or releasing complete series.  My hats off to them a top 10 in my book.,1512691200,3,146,4.214285714285714
4470534,5,B002OOWLBG,"Yes, Yes, Yes, Shout Factory! is on a roll with these release of Diff'rent Strokes and I can't wait to own this one and season 8 when its released. Even though we rarely see Kimberly or Willis these last two seasons I still find the show better than alot of current stuff these days, anyway I hope fans continue to support these releases in order for Shout to pick up more classic shows for us to enjoy over and over again",1511222400,9,422,4.222222222222222

8442141,5,B002OOWLBG,One of my favorite of all times,1526601600,,31,3.5714285714285716
8442142,5,B002OOWLBG,"This series is amongst the best comedy series of all time & should still be airing in heavy rotation like I Love Lucy & Brady Bunch, this season was on during my elementary school years along with classics like Silver Spoons, Transformers, Voltron, Facts of Life, G.I. Joe  & aside from the flack Cooksky's character received, the Sam character got a lot of laughs & season 7 is indeed a great season, I think people confuse the NBC 7th season with the final ABC 8th season & although I still love the ABC 8th for nostalgic reasons, the final ABC 8th season is the season when the show got tired with repeated storylines & the charm started to fade away, I was so sad when the show ended cause at that time in my young life other inevitable changes occurred during that time & inevitable change is apart of life & apart of growing up,  but it's so cool to take a trip down 80's memory lane, relive a great era in time that's long gone & on top of that, I'm enjoying Conrad Bains character through adult eyes, he was so entertaining & brought so much heart to the show, I miss classy characters like him cause I think kids need characters like him on tv today, RIP Conrad Bain, Gary Coleman, Dana Plato & Dixie Carter :'(",1526083200,4,1220,4.323144104803493
8442143,5,B002OOWLBG,Love this video. Nice comedy for the family.,1523923200,,44,4.625
8442144,5,B002OOWLBG,Good season overall. Sam tries to steal the spotlight from Arnold but Arnold still rules the roster. The stories are aimed at Sam and aren't as clever or interesting as past seasons but the rest of the cast makes up for it. Still worth owning if a fan.,1523750400,2,252,4.270833333333333
