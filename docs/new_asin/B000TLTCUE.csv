2907133,5,B000TLTCUE,"I bought this product for my boyfriend and he loved it! It has all the seasons of family guy in one package, and the disks even come in a carrying case for the DVDs, it is a small black case with Stewie on the front. The collector's box was smalled than I thought but that is because you don't get the boxes that the DVDs would come in if you bought them in the store. It also has a ping-pong set that has a net with suction cups on the bottom so you can stick them to the table, 4 balls, and 2 paddles with the characters on them. Lastly there is a poker set that has 2 sets of family guy playing cards, and poker chips with the characters on it.

I personally think it was worth what I paid, it was a better deal then going out and buying all the boxed sets and it came with all the extras.",1196467200,6,792,3.888888888888889
2907134,5,B000TLTCUE,It was terrific. I am so happy that I purchased this product for my boyfriend. He hasn't stopped laughing..,1196035200,,107,4.684210526315789
2907135,5,B000TLTCUE,"This is a great value.  The packaging is great, and I'm fine with the wallet CD case.  Quite easier to carry the entire collection if you are traveling with a laptop or portable DVD player.  The DVD's do fall out of the plastic sleeves quite easy, so be careful.  Buying these separately would not only cost you too much, but it's also not ""Green"".  All that packaging is a waste!  Truthfully the bonus CD contains about 20-30min of goodies (that includes the deleted scenes too), so don't get your hopes up for in-depth behind the scenes stuff.  It'd be hard to make a better Ultimate DVD package w/out increasing costs.  Thanks Amazon for the lowest price possible!!  You guys rock!!",1194825600,11,685,4.641666666666667
2907136,5,B000TLTCUE,"I am a mega huge family guy and i just bought this recently for under a 100 dollars and I must say this was a very well made box set. the box is really well made, thick hard plexi plastic, strong handles, and cool art work all over the box. (check the bottom for an added laugh), the box comes with two decks of cards, dice, 100 poker chips, 25 green, 25 blue, 25 red and 25 yellow, full color ping pong paddles, one with stewie and one with peter, 4 balls each with stewie heads and a full portable net. the coolest part is all the dvds come in an exclusive dvd wallet with family guy art work and a booklet inside with details of each disc. someone wrote a review complaining about the wallet but i think its nicer then some of the other packaging for other box sets. some just came in flimsy card sleeves at lease fox went all out and actully created a very nice and well made box set for the fans. this is a must have for any fan of family guy. also includes a bonus disc with extra features not featured anywhere else. highly recommended. great deal for the price and very nicely made box set.",1194307200,18,1098,4.135514018691588
2907137,4,B000TLTCUE,i bought this yesterday and i like that its cheap and its complete the only thing though is that the dvds come in a case like for cds for the car and its not in a box. that sucks because you cant display it in your collection. so im keeping it in the box with all the other stuff just in case it becomes rare :) other than that cool collection!,1193788800,4,344,3.859154929577465
2907138,5,B000TLTCUE,"i bought the collection for volumes 1-4 and it was 101.93 dollars and this is only like 3 dollars more for a extra volume and ping pong stuff and poker stuff it is a very very good deal. each time i watch the episode over again it still makes me laugh alot!!!!!!

BUY THIS IT IS A GREAT DEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1190073600,7,315,4.338983050847458
2907139,5,B000TLTCUE,"This is what you want to buy, if you're new to family guy and want to see the episodes.  This includes almost everything out so far.  Here's what you'll get.

-Season One (Volume 1)
-Season Two (Volume 1)
-Season Three (Volume 2)
-Season Four Part 1(Volume 3)
-Season Four Part 2(Volume 4)
-Season Five Part 1(Volume 5)
*You do not get Season Five Part 2(Volume 6) as it is not out yet, so you only have the first half of season five*

-Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story

And a Bonus Disc, which includes deleted scenes, an inside the recording booth feature, guest star interviews, storyboards, amoung other things.

-You'll also get a ping pong set (Paddles, Net, and Balls)
-A Poker Set (100 Chips, and Cards)
-And a Collectible Carrying Case.

(All of the discs are the same as how they were released before in the season sets, and include all of the extra footage, and deleted scenes).

The only disc I've found you don't get is ""The Freakin' Sweet Collection"".

Besides the fact that ""The Freakin' Sweet Collection"" is missing, this is the ultimate family guy pack, especially for new family guy fans.  The best thing about the one on amazon, is that the retail price is $150, and amazon is selling for only $100!  That's cheaper than their price for just volumes 1-4.  As for if you have been a fan since it came out, and already own all the seasons, it's up to you if you want to buy this for the carrying case, poker set, and ping pong set.  You will probably be able to find just the carrying case, sooner or later, for those that already own all of the seasons and don't wish to purchase them again.",1187913600,139,1609,4.450511945392491

2907222,4,B000TLTCUE,"Family Guy is a cartoon show featuring the Griffin family airing
regularly on Fox. The Griffins live in a fictitious town in Rhode
Island called Quahog and are obviously meant to be a middle class
family dealing with issues associated with that class.

Family Guy poses as a typical sitcom in many respects. The show centers
on a nuclear family, a theme which is anything but original in the
sitcom genre. Many sitcoms have featured middle class families but
Family Guy is not another generic sitcom.

The cartoon is mean as a contemporary reaction to the media reality
presented in the 1950s to the 1980s. Sitcoms, especially in the
post-WWII era, idealized the middle class. The Griffins are very much
parodies of the ""perfect"" families seen in such shows as Leave it to
Beaver. As portrayed by the media, the middle class is supposed to be
the bedrock of American society, standing alone in holding the rest of
the country together.

The Griffins are far from being America's moral compass. Family Guys is
often criticized for using a crude, immature sense of humor. It is true
the writers employ bathroom humor and foul language in the 30 minute
episodes. What certain critics do not, however, realize is that this
kind of humor serves a purpose. The humor of the cartoon characters
dents the idea that all middle class families have impenetrable moral
values. This makes Family Guy not only watchable but also relatable.

The Griffins are over-exaggerations of middle class family life. This
portrayal of the family as uncouth, gross, etc is a way to make the
family more believable. Family Guy provides its audience with imperfect
characters because it is hard to live up to stands set by other media.
The coarse Peter Griffins telling an inappropriate story involving a
rat while eating dinner with the ""upper crust"" of society at a yacht
club, in the episode ""Peter, Peter Caviar Eater"" is a more likely
depictions of most families than June Cleaver vacuuming in her pearls.

The writers use this humor to attract desired demographic for
advertisers. Shows and networks need to attract viewers because the
ultimate reason for making television programming in America is to grab
hold of viewers' attention and then sell us goods, through
advertisements or product placement. Advertisers are especially
interested in capturing the attention of the eighteen to thirty-nine
year old male category. This demographic seems especially entertain by
the foul language and bathroom humor of Family Guy. Young males,
perhaps more than any other segment of the population, are believed to
think pooping, farting, burping, etc is funny. Young males are also
amused to see the traditional middle class family, meant to be
wholesome, use foul language and toilet humor not usually associated
with that class.

Bottom line is: television is meant to be entertainment. People watch
television to relax and unwind. After coming home from work, viewers
don't want to think about complex things. The slap-stick humor used in
Family Guy is anything but complex. Viewers are able to laugh at the
shows on a very juvenile level.

If you have never watched Family Guy, watch it! On a basic level it's
entertaining to watch Peter Griffin stumble through various awkward
social situations. On a higher level, the show provides witty
commentary on a wide range of contemporary issues-both social and
political.

If Family Guy is not your idea of entertainment and humor, don't watch
it. You can change the channel. No one is forcing you to watch the
show. But maybe you could think about taking a page from the show and
not taking yourself too seriously and enjoy a good childish laugh.",1229904000,,3667,4.980392156862745
2907223,5,B000TLTCUE,"Im a huge Family Guy Fan and i love all the Seasons and the Movie!! but unfortunately the DVD Editions in Germany really suck!!

2907225,5,B000TLTCUE,"This deal was just to good to pass up,the individual seasons are like $35-$40 if not more,this was totally worth it. There are alot of extras,no censorship,just to many positive things to say. I haven't even opened up anything BUT the dvd's! The extra's is bonus stuff.

2907226,1,B000TLTCUE,"Like the title says... ""Great concept. Flawed execution.""

The ping-pong paddles, poker chips, etc. all in one box is a hard deal to argue with. Unfortunately, for all of the bells and whistles, one thing is missing: the actual rest of the series.

For now, the best bet is ""Family Guy - The Complete Collection (Stewie Head Packaging) - (Amazon.com Exclusive)"", though a truly ultimate uber boxset is still forthcoming.

This box is a novelty. Nothing more. And at the current price tag, it's a very expensive novelty. Personally, I'm waiting until it's done correctly before I buy.",1223251200,4,583,4.928571428571429

2907229,5,B000TLTCUE,This is a very good product to purchase for the Family Guy fans. The extras in the box aren't of the best of quality...but the DVD's are all great and the carrying case isn't bad either. I would recommend this product.,1219881600,,218,4.341463414634147
2907250,4,B000TLTCUE,"This was totally worth the 59$ I paid for it in the lightning deal. Hours of laughs. I just have to say though, the first 3 seasons are way more awesome than the seasons 4 and 5. Seasons 1-3 are very random and creative. Seasons 4 and 5 on the other hand are not nearly as random and spontaneous. It seems as though they got all new writers for seasons 4 and 5 and the writers don't build the characters personalities any more. Instead they just use the same old comic formulas over and over. Which seem to aim at college aged people with a lot of unwitting jokes about drugs and alcohol. And there were a lot of times I could say the punch lines for a character, before they even said them. Again, i think this is because the writers are just trying to sell what worked in the first 3 seasons....

Well to make a long opinion short. They should have just kept the show off the air after season 3.. Anyways, buy this if morally questionable cartoons are down your ally of comedy. It will have you laughing long time. Yes, and you will luv it long time.",1218153600,,1052,4.207920792079208
2907251,3,B000TLTCUE,First off I must say I love the Family Guy series. There are two things I do not like about this item though. The first thing is I think they could have picked some better items to put in with the dvd's. The second is the dvd's come in full screen format when there are hardly any full screen tv's left out there.,1218153600,,313,3.984126984126984
2907252,4,B000TLTCUE,This product is a great way to get the first five and a half season on DVD.  The CD zipper case which holds all the seasons is a good idea but some of the DVD's can get scratched; mine fortunately did not though.  The ping pong set and poker set are a cute idea but I don't really play the games.  I think this product is a bit overpriced for what you get.  If you don't plan on using the Ping pong set or the poker set I would say just buy the DVD's individually.,1217808000,,464,3.8526315789473684
2907253,4,B000TLTCUE,It's a definitely must-buy for fans of Family Guy! I bought mine when Amazon was offering it at $60 so it was a bargain!,1215993600,,120,4.041666666666667
2907254,5,B000TLTCUE,"I couldn't care less about the goodies in the box, The snaps to open it are a pain, though that could be a good thing if you have young kids. This show is definitely something that should be screened by a parent before allowing young'ns to watch.

That aside, this collection cost less than the videos alone, and if you like poker and ping pong the added bonuses are a plus.

The DVD case is perfect.  Now I can sell all the other box sets I have for the other seasons and the movie.  I am a card player so I think the cards and chips and pretty funny.  The ping pong table net and balls I don't think I will use for ping pong.  I think the net is staying in the box and I just found a few new balls for beer pong.  =)  Find the cheapest price on it and get it.  under 65 bux will do.,1215993600,,562,3.4878048780487805

Upon receiving the order, I was a little disappointed to find the casing cracked, but not a major concern since I buy it for the casing. The only major problem when purchasing this party pack is, after Season 3, the discs are not labeled by season, only volume. This will be a little confusing when updating my ""Family Guy"" library.

2907305,4,B000TLTCUE,"I bought this for $75 Dollars which was a pretty good deal. As far as packaging goes, I haven't had a chance to use the poker stuff or the ping pong table stuff but I do plan to. The DVDs come in a wallet rather than a case, which is a dissapointment.

As far as quality of the show, I love having Seasons 1-3, which are classics . But the quality of episodes does dip in season 4 and 5, but picks up a bit in season 6. The set doesn't include the latter half of season 5 which sucks balls.

So great show, decent price but lack of a case and last half of season 5 are bummers.",1202774400,,577,3.8403361344537816

2907309,5,B000TLTCUE,"FAMILY GUY is about as edgy as anything out in the animated world right now; it is funny,(no hilarious!),witty,raucous,raunchy,but most of all it tests the limits of the viewer's knowledge of Pop Culture,classic movies,past television programs,classical literature and music,opera,Broadway Shows and much more;episodes range from take-offs on Gene Kelly musicals to Gilbert and Sullivan operettas;classic movies from AMADEUS,THE SHINING to POLTERGEIST;historical figures from Lincoln to Edison, and Biblical knowledge. Anyone who enjoys seeing spoofs done with taste and without taste will enjoy ""The Family Guy' Peter Griffin and his wife Lois,son and daughter Chris and Meg,Baby Stewie and their dog Brian.
After taping these episodes off of television for years, I finally splurged and just bought the whole FREAKIN' 5 volumes. Television does too much editing,and here you can see the episodes in their side-splitting entirety,unedited and commercial-free!
Some folks will not ""get"" FAMILY GUY.I find it to be the most refreshing show on tv along with creator Seth MacFarlane's other animated series AMERICAN DAD.If you cannot take a joke and laugh at yourself,FAMILY GUY is definitely not for you! Gay,straight,Republican,Democrat,sick or well,addict or addiction-free,wealthy or poor....you must be able to roll with the punches and allow yourself to have fun and laugh at the taboo or you will never make it!!!!

2907336,5,B000TLTCUE,"The packaging of this is damn clever. Visually interesting - a clear box with images plastered all over it - then a ping pong set (everything but the table), poker chips and dice - Seth's way of saying get a life I think. The wallet is actually convenient - the boxes of the individual seasons issued aren't exactly high-toned. One thing - the booklet might have listed WHICH episodes have commentaries instead of having to hunt them one by one.

I have a modest suggestion for TV box sets. One, we don't need the credits on the openings - we're not watching a broadcast. Remove them and put them in a black screen at the end. And create the episodes whatever length you like, and put the complete episodes on the DVDs - cut the material you need to for TV, but don't put the outtakes separate on the DVD, just show us the original complete conception. That would justify buying what you've already seen repeated ad nauseum broadcast on several channels.

That said, the outtake disk is very good, if short - sometimes one line. There's a lot more, some guy was selling a much longer bootleg of outtakes from the first two seasons years ago. Holding back for the End of Days Freakin' Last Word Complete Family Guy Box? Give it up, Seth.",1199664000,,1236,4.488888888888889
2907337,3,B000TLTCUE,"This is a great value to own all of the seasons on DVD, but the extras seem so lame and thrown in there, and I'd rather own each box individually for the keep-cases. I agree with IGN that the extra stuff seems tossed at random. I would have had stuff like Pawtucket shot glasses,a gold clam trphey, or Drunken Clam coasters/mugs/cards, anything more relative to the show itself that is actually fun/funny. If you are a die hard fan, or just want all of the seasons on DVD then it is a good value, but I skipped this myself.",1198713600,4,523,4.292929292929293

2907339,5,B000TLTCUE,"This is probabely the best deal out there, anyone who waited this long to have all, but last, seasons should definitely buy this. BUT, is it too much to ask to make the box the size of standard DVDcases? You'd think it isn't, but they didn't make this happen. So when I buy more seasons I can't put them in the box... Just 5mm wider and the cases would fit in perfectly, or am I wrong? There must be a reason they didn't do this, only I can't think of one that makes any sense.

8210163,4,B000TLTCUE,"Seth MacFarlane is obviously a comic genius and a super animator.  Each episode starts with a song about ""family values""--which are then generally ignored, with the show illustrating alcoholism, drug abuse, homosexuality, promiscuity, pedophilism, and violence.  Thus the show is certainly not for children!  For adults, it's a great stress-reliever.  The Family Guy is the the father, Peter Griffin, an endomorph with a third grade education, a certified retard, and seriously demented--but fun to be around.  He can read, however, and drive a car and even hold a job.  He's the illegitimate son of an Irish drunk.  His wife, Lois Griffin, comes from an upper class family and is generally more sane than the rest of the characters--but even she stooped to shop-lifting in one episode; in another episode, she became the mayor of Quahog for a time.  Her father is a wealthy business executive, one of the elite of Rhode Island. The children of Peter and Lois include Chris, Meg, and Stewie (the first, Peter Jr., was shaken to death by Peter).  Chris is the worst student in high school, but well-endowed and a musician; in one episode he married into a tropical tribe.  Meg is unpopular at high school (and made fun of by the class queen, Connie D.) and homely (except for the one episode where she underwent a makeover).  She discovers religion while recovering from mumps.  Stewie, the baby, is a super-tech genius, able to create a time machine and a transporter (which he used to kidnap the cast of Star Trek:  Next Generation), but he's also psychotic.  He hates his mother!  The dog, Brian, almost finished Brown University; he's generally more sane than the other family members (yes, he's a talking dog), but he has a drinking problem and a drug problem. and is Leftist.  He once ran onto a dog race field to copulate with a female race dog contestant, but he usually dates human females!  He and Stewie do quite a few musical duets together.  A friend of the family is Glenn Quagmeyer, a pilot, who has lots of girl-friends and lots of parties, and cannot control his sexual urges.  Another friend is Cleveland, a black guy, who takes lots of baths; he divorced his wife Loretta because she cheated on him with Quagmeyer.  The third friend is Joe Swanson, a policeman who's paralyzed below the waist from an accident.  Then there is the mayor of Quahog, Adam West, who changes his decisions quite often (e.g., first legalizing pot, and then re-illegalizing it).  There's also a Jewish pharmacist, Goldman, who does business with the family.  All-in-all, the episodes are great for adults, but please avoid having kids around when you're watching....",1465257600,,2660,4.888392857142857
