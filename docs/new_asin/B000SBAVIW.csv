2884079,5,B000SBAVIW,"In Australia, the Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet series was screened in our early days of television in the late 1950's and early 60's and was known as ""The Nelsons"".

This 12 DVD set is a wonderful reminder of those golden days of family values and good clean fun.

I am delighted with my purchase and such a very affordable price.",1198540800,2,333,4.442622950819672

2884081,5,B000SBAVIW,"Ok, I am giving this dvd set five stars because of the amount of episodes in this low priced box set. True, the quality of the shows vary from one to another, but at least I have one hundered shows to watch on dvd now instead of off my vhs copies from the Disney Channel.

On the box it says the shows are digitally re-mastered, but I don't see this.

I like the included old commericals and the early episodes. I thought I had all the episodes made, but found a few on here I had never seen.

Five stars because Mill Creek is giving us one hundred shows of this underappreicated show.",1191888000,9,585,4.15929203539823
2884082,4,B000SBAVIW,"I recently purchased the Essential Ozzie and Harriet Collection and have to say that it exceeds my expectations.  I have not viewed all 100 episodes but those that I did are very watchable and very funny.  This is a 12 disc set and I had a problem with several of the discs that I received in the original shipment from Amazon. They made a high pitch spinning noise in my OPPO DVD player.  I contacted Amazon customer service and they immediately shipped me out a replacement set.  It was a real pleasure dealing them them.  They really seem to care about their customers.  I received the second set in two days and had similar problems with other discs.  Mind you again all were watchable.  I again contacted Amazon Customer Service and they offered to refund my money or ship a third set.  I told them to standby and I contacted Mill Creek to discuss the problem I was having.  The customer service people at Mill Creek were also excellent and immediately shipped out the three disc's that I was having a problem with.  They solved the problem.

Both Amazon and Mills Creek showed that they really care about there customers and stand 100% behind their products.

I continue to watch the set several times a week and have enjoyed each episode.  Some even have the original commercials in them.  I highly recommend the set to any Ozzie and Harriet fan.",1191542400,18,1353,4.579166666666667
2884083,5,B000SBAVIW,"This 12 DVD set of 100 hundred episodes ""The Essential Ozzie and Harriet collection"" is the single largest collection available from Mill Creek Entertainment. Prior collections available on DVD usually contain 4 episodes in one to four separate volumes. This is a fantastic buy in one book style package of virtually all the available episodes for a very small price.

As far as quality over quantity the official Nelson estate ""The Best of The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" 4 DVD set from Shout Factory should be your first stop, and is a must for any true fan or Ozzie & Harriet collector. That said, this product states on the rear of the package the ""episodes have been digitally re-mastered."" The sound is of excellent quality including for the musical performances. The vast majority of the episodes have good to very good video quality. Some of the shows have what I would call problems with the contrast-their faces are washed out too white. Their is a minimal amount of artifact or jittering of the video in a only few episodes. We obviously don't know how terrible the source material was for these video transfers so I surmise they cleaned them up the best they could without breaking the bank on any one episode. If these shows were truly digitally re-mastered it was only to a certain point dictated by budget issues most likely.

No special features or commentaries in this unofficial release of public domain episodes. It has a basic menu allowing all or each individual show to be played. The 12 DVD's are each in their own pocket slip case with art to match the cover and number 1-12 with the episodes printed on the back of each. The front box cover opens like a book with the 12 discs piled together in a single space inside. The back cover has all one hundred shows listed in order, but not by DVD so you are not sure which particular disc to go for without looking at the pocket cases inside.

The episodes themselves seem to be in chronological order with the first ones having Ricky and David as boys,then in college and then married as attorneys at the end. There are plenty of singing performances by Ricky.
A particular delight is some singing and duets by Ozzie & Harriet together such as in ""A Cruise for Harriet"". The boys are featured doing many different activities as they grow older, such as David dressed up in black leather a la Marlon Brando racing motorcycles against his parents concerns in ""The Motorcycle"". The commercials for Hotpoint, Listerine, Kodack and especially Coca-Cola are fun must see vintage all by themselves.
This box set with so many episodes will give the newbie fan or collector a real good picture into the life of the overall show as a whole-the longest running sitcom of its kind in TV history on ABC from 1952-1966 with a total of 435 episodes.",1189641600,14,2807,4.666666666666667
2884084,5,B000SBAVIW,"Wonderful set!, some episodes are better quality than others, but it's all still very watchable. A few have been edited, but most of them are not. I really like the commercials. Kodak; Quaker Oats, Aunt Jemima, Hot Point, Coke, and even Listerine!, Some of them even have the Nelson family members doing the ads! The Anita Bryant Coca-Cola commercials are a must see! Also, I thought I'd mention that the ""Flying Down to Lunch"" episode is actually the episode; ""The T-Shirts"" from Season 8. That said and done; I highly recommend this set to Ozzie & Harriet fans.",1187568000,42,563,4.755102040816326
2884085,5,B000SBAVIW,"Let me begin this review by saying that this isn't the best looking DVD collection of ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" on the market; that honor goes to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-the-Adventures-of-Ozzie-and-Harriet/dp/B000MGBSQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of the Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</a>&nbsp;collection from Shout! Factory that was produced in cooperation with surviving members of the Nelson family, and which features the best looking transfers of the series as well as numerous extra features.  That said, this set from Mill Creek Entertainment certainly gives you a healthy serving of the series' run (100 episodes of a series total of 435) and represents the largest collection of Ozzie & Harriet episodes available on DVD in a single collection.  Incidentally, this is a greatly expanded version of Mill Creek's earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ozzie-Harriet-Classics-4pc/dp/B000NVIGF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ozzie & Harriet Classics (4pc)</a>&nbsp;collection of 38 episodes.

The episodes are not restored and very definitely of the audio/visual quality associated with public domain releases (which this collection is), but I've watched about half of the episodes in this collection and have to say that the vast majority of the episodes are highly watchable.  A few of the episodes are syndicated versions running as little as 20 minutes (ironically, the episode titled ""Be On Time"" has the 20 minute running time), but the majority are full length versions, many of which are complete with original commercials and network IDs and running in excess of 29 minutes.  By contrast, all of the episodes in the official collection from Shout! Factory are edited, syndicated versions running, on average, around 22 and a half minutes.  Rick Nelson fans will be delighted to know that most musical numbers are included in this set.  So in addition to seeing a great family comedy, you get a chance to see the evolution of one of rock & roll's early superstars.  It also appears that the episodes are in chronological order, suggesting that Mill Creek actually researched the series for this release (atypical for most companies releasing public domain material).

The episodes are spread across 12 single-sided discs, with each disc containing eight to nine episodes and featuring a simple menu selection that allows you to either play all episodes or select the specific episode that you wish to view.  Each disc is housed in its own cardboard folder; in turn, the 12 discs are housed in a laminated cardboard package that has a full listing of the episode titles on the back of the box.  There are no DVD extras per se but, as mentioned above, the vast majority of the episodes contain original commercials and/or sponsor tags.  It's fun to watch the Nelson family hawk products for Kodak, Quaker Oats and others.  If there's a negative to this set, I suppose that it's the Mill Creek logo which appears briefly in the bottom right corner twice in each episode.  The good news is that it's relatively unobtrusive and really won't detract much from your viewing experience.  Viewers should also be aware that episodes from the show's 14th and final season were originally filmed in color; here they are presented in black & white.

The fact that Mill Creek has been able to assemble 100 episodes of this beloved family comedy series at a very affordable price is commendable.  No other company has been able to bring this many episodes to the market in a single package.  What makes this set even better is the inclusion of a number of episodes from the show's earlier years.  Most of the Ozzie & Harriet collections of public domain episodes focus on the show's years from the 1960s when David and Ricky were in college, married, and later started their careers.  There are plenty of those episodes in this set, but the inclusion of so many episodes from the 1950s when the boys were younger really distinguishes this set from the other Ozzie & Harriet collections that are available and, as such, makes this the definitive collection to own . . . . . at least until such time that someone issues something better.

This set is a must for fans of ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" and to those who appreciate warm-hearted family humor from a simpler time.  My rating on this is closer to **** & , just missing the full five stars due a few beat-up looking prints included in this set.  But, rest assured, you will not be disappointed if you purchase ""The Essential Ozzie & Harriet Collection.""",1186358400,165,4638,5.229419703103914

2884088,5,B000SBAVIW,"Great box set.  All the good shows are here.  Great  Ricky Nelson music.  Once upon a time things were really okay and life was good.  This show sums that all up.  I wish that everyone could have Ozzie and Harriet for parents.  Maybe the world would be better if Ozzie and Harriet had a chance to run it, way back when.",1396828800,,319,4.131147540983607
2884089,5,B000SBAVIW,The Nelsons are the family we always wanted to be but couldn't quite make it!  Still stands the test of time.  I really love the old commercials as well and take a look at Harriet's kitchen for the early fifties!  In Australia we were lucky to have a refrigerator and wash the clothes in a wood fuelled copper pot.  Another great buy,1383868800,,333,4.32258064516129

2884092,5,B000SBAVIW,Ozzie and Harriet and their sons present a great sitcom that models a wholesome family without being sickening about it.  I really enjoy it.  I only vaguely remember it from the '50s.,1358640000,,183,4.6875

The only comment I have is there is no listing of the songs Rick sang on the show.  If anyone can help me with a list of shows and the songs when Rick sang, please let us all know.  This is a wonderful series of Nelson entertainment. It's well worth the money.  Hope you enjoy the Nelsons too.

2884097,5,B000SBAVIW,"I was hoping 'The Complete Ozzie and Harriet Collection' would come out, but so far, no luck. I've researched different sets, but none had as many episodes as 'The Essential Ozzie & Harriet.'
This DVD set has it's ups and downs, but many more ups..Definately, a Must Buy, a 5-Star-plus Rating.
Although this 12 Disk set isn't in the same order as the weekly show, in the first two disks, David and Ricky are young boys. As the episodes progress, so do the handsome brothers. From children to married adults.

If you enjoyed Ozzie and Harriet shows, you'll love 'The Essential Ozzie and Harriet.'

The price can't be beat. I hope they remake a second 100 Episodes, then a third, then the remaining shows. It might not be in order, but it's one way to get the complete collection.",1304208000,,778,4.589928057553957

The quality is not that great but most of the original episodes seem in tact, and where else can you get so much for so little?  Highly recommended. We are fast approaching the 25th anniversary of Ricky's death which makes this series even more special.",1291507200,2,316,4.543859649122807
2884099,5,B000SBAVIW,"What a great set to own!  Would love to have all seasons but this is the next best thing.  There was a great assortment of episodes and the quality was good.

2884101,5,B000SBAVIW,"My husband and I had a blast from the past watching Ricky and David growing up before our eyes in this old TV series.  Both of us had forgotten what a comedian little Ricky was.  It was such good clean laughter before retiring for bed each evening.  After finishing the DVD's, we were able to realize that Ricky was like his Mom and David like his Dad.  When young, I don't believe we saw that.",1280016000,2,394,4.213333333333333
2884102,4,B000SBAVIW,"I have only had a chance to watch the first DVD in this set so far.

2884104,2,B000SBAVIW,"This comment is primarily for the benefit of those who came of age after the era of black-and-white television.  In my opinion, the picture quality in this set ranges from fair to horrible (black tones totally gone).  Even in those portions I rate as ""fair,"" much of the background detail is indistinct or muddy.  The sound quality generally is decent, however.  Despite these deficiencies, this 100 episode set is worth $11.49, the steeply discounted price.  As others have noted, the original commercials are a nice bonus.

It is a shame that so much of our television heritage has been allowed to degrade to this state.  If you would like to see what a black-and-white television program of the same era looks like when properly restored, watch ""I Love Lucy"" on DVD.  Almost as good is ""Perry Mason.""  Given that ""The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet"" ran almost three times longer than ""I Love Lucy,"" let's hope that this series will be properly restored and offered in season sets.",1260144000,14,983,4.803571428571429

It whet my appetite for more so I ordered this set. I am very glad I did. Filled my heart with warm and wonderful memories of a time gone by that I am glad I was a part of. An excellent show that I had forgotten about until recently. Great family entertainment with wholesome story lines, subtle humor and,the entire Nelson family who serve as excellent,healthy role models. A show I recommend highly.

2884111,5,B000SBAVIW,"I was a kid during the last few years Ozzie & Harriet were on in prime time.  I got to see reruns only for a short while as a teenager.  This DVD set contains almost all episodes I don't believe I ever saw.  Like many other reviewers here, the Tutti-Fruitti episode stands out--it was one I did remember.

David's acting stands out as I watch.  He was not appreciated as much as he should have been.  I am also noticing how often Harriet has a really funny line.  Ricky and the other regulars were also good, but there is no doubt Ozzie was the top laugh-maker.  His character was not a buffoon, and he wasn't portrayed as a nitwit in any way.  But he found a way to get into trouble doing or saying things and had to work his way out.

The series contains some of the most realistic family stories ever in a TV series.  I mean the things that happened to the Nelsons could well have happened in my family or yours.  The characters behaved like real people do, instead of like so many characters in today's comedies.

I think there were funnier series, but this one deserves to be included when people discuss top TV sitcoms.  Dick Van Dyke and Seinfeld might be the first inductees in the TV Sitcom Hall of Fame, but before long, Ozzie and Harriet would have to take their place alongside the other greats.  The 14-year run of the show is still a record for comedies filmed with real actors, not animated shows.

The DVD set might be a bit simple, but it is easy to get to the episodes.  Some sets I've purchased for other series make you push a lot of buttons just to see an episode.  The pictures are quite clear on my TV and I have experienced no sound troubles.  (As I write, I have two discs yet to watch--we are spacing them out, mixing this series with a couple of others.)  The original commercials are well worth watching as well.

I would love to see the rest of the shows, particularly more when the boys were younger, like everyone else.  But for now, I am grateful to have this large group of episodes from a wonderful old series.",1234915200,3,2044,4.295811518324608

2884116,5,B000SBAVIW,"I was a devout follower of this show for many years back in the mid 1980s when The Disney Channel ran this show.  It came on weekday afternoons at 12:30 & weknights at 11pm & saturdays at 6pm & occasionally 11pm.

I couldn't get enough of this sitcom.  It was pure escapism.  Ozzie & Harriet is absolutely timeless in its appeal to fans of 1950s nostalgia & those who enjoy classic comedy at its best.  I have always thought David was much more appealing & sexier than Ricky, & thought June was far more attractive than Kris.  I was a Dave & June fan every bit as much as an Ozzie & Harriet fan.  Just the overall chemistry between Dave & June & Ozzie & Harriet was great to watch.

I thought Ricky was so cute & adorable when he was younger on the show.  I wanted to squeeze his cheeks.  I thought he matured into a very attractive man as he got into his twenties.  David was simply more sophisticated than Ricky, & that appealed to me greatly & still does.

One of the finest episodes in this set that comes to mind is Tutti Frutti Ice Cream - In which Ozzie has this huge craving for Tutti Futti Ice Cream & goes out in the middle of the night with Harriet to try & find a place open to buy some!
I also loved the episode, David & The Teenager, in which a young teenager (Bernadette Withers, Bachelor Father's Ginger) in Dave's building has a crush on him.  Dave's married to June at this time. It's really cute!  I don't see it listed in this particular set though, which amazes me as it's one of the best episodes in my opinion, & 100 shows covers alot of ground!  But this is still an excellent addition to anyone's library & boasts the largest number of episodes contained in any set for this particular series.

Ozzie & Harriet is one of those shows you can watch over & over again & never tire of its magic & it's also the type of show that can even make you forget about your cares for awhile.  I highly recommend this set to anyone.  I'm prejudiced, I'm an admittedly huge fan of Ozzie & Harriet & have been for over twenty years when I first discovered it on The Disney Channel.  Actually, when I was a teenager in the mid 1980s, my folks & I briefly lived in southern california & I recall Channel 5 (KTLA) doing a holiday retrospective of Ozzie & Harriet at christmas time that I'd never seen or heard about again.  Does anyone at all have any recollection of this?

Anyway, I'd first heard of O&H then & had remembered about them a couple of years later  when The Disney Channel began showing reruns, which is when I became a fan of the series.

I hope the entire series becomes available in season sets at some stage, however, I DO recall an article in an old Disney Channel magazine where David (who was doing his documentary, Rick Nelson: A Brother Remembers)was quoted as saying Ozzie was a perfectionist & critical of himself in certain episodes, which ended up being a list of about a hundred or so where Ozzie would make a note saying ""Ozzie not good in this one"", & those were the particular episodes that David said he didn't include in The Disney package when the reruns were showing because it was out of respect for his father, which of course is understandable, which means I would think, that maybe in a nutshell that is an answer to those of you hoping to see a complete release someday of all episodes.  I myself would love nothing more than to see all 435 episodes restored & released, but am wondering if anyone can shed any potential light on the possibility of this actually coming to fruition.

Anyway FIVE BIG STARS for this OZZIE & HARRIET DVD set!!!

P.S. Now, all we need is Here Come The Nelsons on DVD.  I've got the VHS, but there's a restriction against copying it to DVD, so let's hope an official release of this is in the works as well! :-)  I'm a big fan of the old O&H radio series as well, needless to say :-)",1226275200,4,3859,4.285517241379311
2884117,5,B000SBAVIW,"I ordered this set for my husband's birthday, as he is a long-time fan of this old 50s and 60s series, especially Ricky Nelson.  The episodes are fun and many old commercials are included. I would recommend this for any fan of these vintage TV programs.",1223510400,,253,4.5
2884118,5,B000SBAVIW,"I received this as a Fathers' Day gift and have thoroughly enjoyed watching these episodes of a great old sitcom. For some reason, ""Ozzie and Harriet"" re-runs haven't been shown over the years as much as other programs of the era. I think I've seen every episode ever made of ""Leave it to Beaver"", ""Dick Van Dyke Show"", and ""Andy Griffith Show"". But almost all the episodes on this DVD set were new to me. So it wasn't a nostalgic experience so much as a discovery of a lost TV treasure.
The DVD set contains roughly a fourth of the episodes from the long-running series. They seem to be a pretty good sample distribution from 1952-1966. (A few might be out of sequence; for example, Dave is married in one episode and seems to be single again in the next). And speaking of the boys' wives, June (Dave's real and TV wife) is seen in a handful of episodes on the later discs (once or twice as a different character before settling in as June); and Kris (Rick's real and TV wife) is seen in several episodes as well. Interestingly, the two girls never appear together in any of the episodes in the set.
If the idea of a story in which the characters spend an entire sleepless night in a desperate, cravings-driven quest for tutti-frutti ice cream seems just too boring to you, steer clear of this DVD set. But if you believe that, in the hands of the right cast and writers, such an idea just might be charming and funny -- then get this set. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1218067200,7,1477,4.316546762589928
2884119,4,B000SBAVIW,I love this DVD series.  It has some very funny episodes. Only a few of them are lacking in picture quality but some of them are 50 years old. Still a good value for the price.,1210809600,,176,3.888888888888889
2884120,5,B000SBAVIW,"If you liked Ozzie & Harriet you will LOVE this set! The quality is very good, not perfect, but I think they did a great job remastering it.
OMG I cannot get enough of this set! I completely go into another world, which is where those old shows seemed to come from. I feel like I'm back in the womb watching them!
My favorite episode, hands down, is Tutti Frutti Ice-Cream- I drive my family crazy !! Harriet, in her forties can dance up a storm! And David is sooooooooooo cute as the singing waiter. I love this family so much! Each member had their special charm :)
It's very funny to see characters change roles, as happened in those days.
My fav neighbor is Thorny (Don Defore) who went on to be stellar in ""Hazel"". He doesn't change but many others do. Frank Cady starts as a repairman and ends up as a doctor!!
I like the commercials as much as the shows! They are so primitive and funny. The simplicity can be appreciated in this new century of modern TV. I'm very glad they included them.
I'm so thrilled that Ozzie and Harriet is available to old TV show lovers like me.
It is simply a treasure!",1207094400,8,1104,4.287081339712919
2884121,3,B000SBAVIW,"These shows are pure enjoyment.  Simple,& funny.  When you are through watching the show you have a feel good feeling.  The shows that have the boys when they are younger (espcially Ricky), are very entertaining.  The only thing that I did not like was the poor quality of the DVD's.  The picture were not clear, very fuzzy.  The shows were great, but poor in quality.",1204243200,4,368,4.584615384615384
2884122,4,B000SBAVIW,"Again, buy this if you are a fan.  That being said, I have to give this four stars only because these disks will not play well in every player.  We have an Xbox 360, an Xbox, a DVD player, and four computers with DVD players in our house.  Plays well on most, but on the Xbox and one computer the disks vibrate and are horribly loud.  I'm guessing it's a balance problem from the very attractive full surface picture on the disk.  Love the content, just would like to play it in whatever player I'm plopped down in front of.  (Horribly spoiled.)  I'd buy this again anyway!",1203033600,2,573,4.299065420560748

Gone are the days of not having to worry about weither it is safe to go out for a pizza at night or to even turn on the tv in the company of your Minister. For those of us who remember the days when things were different it is good to be able to access the older decent comedy programming like Ozzie and Harriet. Hours of wonderful clean comedy entertainment. It is well worth it at twice the price.,1202428800,,450,4.067415730337078

NOW MY EXPECTIONS HAVE FALLEN SHORT, MAINLY, BECAUSE I EXPECTED THE QUALITY OF THESE DVDS TO BE EXTREMLY GOOD. BUT INSTEAD I FIND THE PICTURE QUALITY ON DISCS IS VERY POOR. ITS WONDERFUL THAT SO MANY EPISODES WERE PUT IN ONE COLLECTION,THE PICTURE IS VERY DISAPPOINTING.. AUDIO HOWEVER IS VERY GOOD, BUT I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS COLLECTION IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARD OF DVDS LIKE HAZEL, SEASON ONE AND ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS SEASON ONE.BOTH THESE DVDS ARE ALSO IN BLACK AND WHITE, BUT THEIR PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT. THOUGH IT STATES ON THE BOX THESE ARE DIGITALLY RE-MASTERED( THEIR NOT) BUT THE PICTURE QUALITY WOULD BETTER. THIS GOT 4 STAR RATING DUE TO THE NUMBER OF EPISODES IN COLLECTION, OTHERWISE  IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING .THE EPISODES ARE FUN TO WATCH AND VERY FUNNY, THE NELSONS ARE REALLY GOOD REPRESTATIONS OF THE APPLE PIE FAMILY. MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT HAVE SHORT CHANGED THIS FAMILY. PICTURE QUALITY "" YUK"" NELSON FAMILY GREAT"".",1199577600,5,1039,4.937142857142857
