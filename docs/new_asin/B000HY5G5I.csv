3002285,5,B000HY5G5I,"If you love Victoria Principal you will love this movie.

It is done in 3 vignettes that span the decades.  Each one involves intrique, seduction, and consipracy.  Yet each is completely different from the other.

Of the 3 my personal favorite is the 3rd and final.  You are kept on your toes so pay attention.",1184457600,10,310,4.5636363636363635
3002286,4,B000HY5G5I,I found it campy and entertaining..reminds me of the old 80 movies of the week...and love the fact it was a trilogy...are those even done anymore? my favorite was the third one..very sexy...and a cool twist at the end...nice.,1439251200,,225,4.794871794871795

3002291,5,B000HY5G5I,"Victoria Principal and John Terry were excellent, as was Michael Rhodes directing. It kept my attention and forgot that  Victoria and John played  the different characters in the three stories. Very well photographed and beautiful Art Direction.",1366502400,,245,5.594594594594595
3002292,4,B000HY5G5I,I enjoyed the different twist on all 3 vignettes. Victoria Principal played her part as seductress and humble one. Worth a look at.,1363996800,,131,4.739130434782608

3002294,5,B000HY5G5I,"I really love the structure of this movie, with the three different stories sharing the same themes of passion, desire, and love.  They're all separately very interesting with great surprise endings.  Victoria Principal is perfect for the role as I'm sure all will see (ESPECIALLY the men LOL).  Definitely worth ordering.",1334534400,,322,5.2745098039215685
3002295,4,B000HY5G5I,"I ended up liking this DVD because each story have a surprise ending that makes the story satisfying and suspense along the way was worth it. Victoria Principal looks fabulous, for someone not in her 20s or 30s (though I don't know how old she's here), and I had hoped to see some nudity but there wasn't any. But she did pretty good being leading role in each tale.",1207958400,13,366,4.318840579710145
