7975321,5,B00007CVRK,"I love this DVD and I watch it over and over. I've been supporting 3LW since they first came out and when this DVD dropped, I got it for $10. I'm just curious as to why the individual sellers have priced this so high? $90 and $700; are you SERIOUS?? For a DVD!? It's not even being imported! My DVD is still in great condition so it doesnt concern me but I feel like you'll be ripping off other fans or pushing them away from enjoying a great work.",1205884800,,448,4.044943820224719
7975322,1,B00007CVRK,This is absolute rubbish. I purchased both 3LW cd's and absolutely loved them - couldn't stop listening to them. I bought this DVD to see what they would be like live- every song is mimed to a backing tape. Its just simply boring and a rip off - not to mention it only goes for just under an hour. Not worth the money or time.,1143072000,,326,4.030769230769231
7975323,5,B00007CVRK,"If you are a fan of 3LW or of good R&B music then this dvd is for you. Most of the songs that are performed on this dvd is from their newest cd A Girl Can Mack. There are a few songs performed that are from different cds like soundtracks and their first album. Most of the songs are really upbeat and it will make you will want to dance with them. There are a few slower songs. This dvd has the 3 original 3LW members. This dvd has really great chorography and back up dancers and all 3 members have great voices. You will want to watch the dvd over and over again.

As far as the extras go, you get to see what 3LW does on their day off and you get to watch the soundcheck of 2 great songs (No More/Baby I'ma do Right and I Do Wanna Get Close To You).

You cannot go wrong with this dvd. If you are not a fan of 3LW, after you watch this dvd you will be.",1097625600,,855,3.797752808988764
7975324,5,B00007CVRK,"I saw this concert when it aired on Nickelodeon. It was very cool. Even though it was the last thing that Naturi did with the group before she left, it was still an amazing performance from all of the girls. The songs that they performed were cool and upbeat, the performances were tight, and the concert was just hot overall. If you're a fan of 3LW, then you should consider buying this DVD. It's really cool. You should really check this out.",1058140800,3,444,4.426829268292683
