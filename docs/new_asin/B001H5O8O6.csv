8307860,4,B001H5O8O6,"This is solid 4. Not a high budget but adequate acting,  good acting from the main character.
Ray is a decent, productive man wrestling with half visible memories of a father who beat and eventually killed his mother. As these memories come alive they bring emotions for which he is not prepared. Ray witnesses a man in a parking lot getting physical with his wife and he beats the abuser. Enter a police detective who's as scarred by the violence between Ray's parents as Ray himself.

Interesting. Emotional. Fairly intricate. It looks beyond the violence and into choices each of us must make, regardless of our experiences. I don't have a problem with the ending as others did. It gives us closure to a story that, like real life in these matters, has no easy answers. Recommend!",1436659200,,783,4.708029197080292
8307861,2,B001H5O8O6,"I love thrillers, but this really is a B movie. I started watching it and was trying to give it a chance but it was stupid , so i turned it off and will rent something else. Sorry",1394582400,,179,3.736842105263158
8307862,2,B001H5O8O6,"The movie has a good suspenseful plot.  The ending, however, drops all suspense and leaves the viewer thinking...""What??""  Very much a let down.",1389225600,2,144,5.217391304347826
8307863,1,B001H5O8O6,"I am a huge fan of movies that are out there. But this one ended stupidly. Made no sense really . Well , it does make sense if it was meant the way i suspect it was but that made it feel like a total waste of time and boring. Glad i didn't have to pay rent on it.  Very unexciting movie with little mystery at all.",1362268800,4,314,3.6865671641791047
8307864,3,B001H5O8O6,"This is definitely an ""indie"" film in the classic sense - meaning it is not a heavily funded project. The plot draws on many themes that we have all seen before. The main character had a terrible experience in his childhood, and during the course of the film, he begins to remember the tragic events. Unfortunately, uncovering the suppressed memories turns him into a completely different character (hence the title of the film). The switch was too sudden and severe. It upset the entire film.

Also, there is a secondary story involving a police detective. At the beginning he seems like a troubled cop who could not solve a case. But we later discover that he is connected to the main character. Unfortunately, he unravels too. In one scene he shows up to interview a witness with liquor and a lit cigarette! Creepy!

I really wish the director could have afforded a good color editor. The film is basically brown, beige and gray.

Despite these flaws, I kept watching. Dameon Clarke gave an intense performance, and he is absolutely beautiful to see on the screen. Delicious eye candy! Clarke keeps the film in the ""three"" range.",1357948800,6,1132,4.76530612244898
