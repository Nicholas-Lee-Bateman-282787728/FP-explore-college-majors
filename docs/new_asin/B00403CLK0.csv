4237790,5,B00403CLK0,"The Katherine Jenkins:  Believe-Live From O2 was one of the best concerts I have seen in a long time.  From the variety of material she performed to the way she performed it, the total experience of Believe was thoroughly pleasant and enjoyable.  I also had the pleasure of seeing Katherine Jenkins live in concert where she performed many of the same songs as on the DVD and then had the privelege of meeting her after the show.  She is as pleasant as she is talented.  I think that Sarah Brightman has some serious competition!  Any fan of classical-crossover would enjoy thid DVD, even if they hadn't heard of Ms. Jenkins.",1296950400,,625,4.636363636363637
4237791,5,B00403CLK0,This is one of the most beautiful and enchanting shows I have ever watched. Katherine Jenkins has a marvelous voice in addition to being a beautiful and very sweet young lady. I recently attended her concert in Philadelphia and was fascinated by her voice and charm.,1290038400,9,266,4.804347826086956
4237792,5,B00403CLK0,"The most pure and powerful voice! Only Charlotte Church when she was in her prime can compare, in my opinion. Such a great gift from God. This concert is spectacular!!!!!!!",1402876800,,172,4.766666666666667
4237793,5,B00403CLK0,"I am always impressed by her visual beauty but touched and moved by the sound of  her Angelic voice  !
Whatever she sings in whatever genre and language -she sings from her soul and with the passion and inspiration of a an artist who feels and sings with the same emotion of the original composer and songwriter - she is simply inspirational and unique!

 Everything about her is poetic and beautiful to the superlative degree - I admire her greatly and will always be an ardent fan !!!",1400976000,,486,4.488636363636363

4237797,2,B00403CLK0,Too much schmaltz for me....lots of costumes and fal-de -ral!!  She looks like a Barbie doll and can hardly stand to watch the screen.,1380672000,,134,4.583333333333333
4237798,5,B00403CLK0,"I looked up her music when I saw her on Dancing with the Stars. I have watched this dvd 5 or 6 times and I love it more every time. the best part is the song ""The angel"". it makes me cry, it is so beautiful. what a gorgeous voice and a gorgeous woman.",1380412800,,251,3.6666666666666665
4237799,5,B00403CLK0,That voice!  Perfect setting and amazing sets and dancers in the background to make the music come alive.  Unique in a Sarah Brightman way (and I adore Sarah!).,1379808000,,160,4.678571428571429
4237800,5,B00403CLK0,"Katerine Jenkins Believe - Live from the O2 Is a great representation of the talents that Ms Jenkins has. It is well presented and explores all levels of her voice with great assistance of dancers, acrobates and musicians. I recommend it to all who enjoy an outstanding concert headlined by one of the great young singers - Katherine Jenking.",1379203200,,342,4.813559322033898
4237801,5,B00403CLK0,"The information on Amazon makes it appear Katherine's Believe DVD Blu Ray version will not work in North America, but it does. I decided to take a chance and ordered the Blu Ray version, because I loved the standard version so much. To my surprise the Blu Ray version worked perfectly in my Panasonic BDT-220 BR player. Katherine is so gorgeous you need to see her in Blu Ray to experience her full ethereal beauty. Her beauty, amazing voice, intelligence, and genuinely sweet personality makes her one of the most amazing entertainers in the world.",1363651200,,549,4.7894736842105265

4237803,5,B00403CLK0,"Just can't believe the talent, beauty, and grace that is rolled up into this one little lady.  She is a pleasure to watch and listen to - whether speaking or singing.",1361145600,,166,4.354838709677419
4237804,5,B00403CLK0,Karherine Jenkins is the worlds best singer. I never get tired of listening to her on YouTube.com My favorites are Come What May sung at Royal Albert Hall where she is easily one of the worlds most beautiful women in an evening gown. My other favorite is when she sings with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Her voice is fantastic and she is extremely beautiful. This DVD is well worth watching as is everything she does. The only complaint I have is she doesn't make enough DVD's because I would buy every one.,1359590400,,507,4.521739130434782
4237805,4,B00403CLK0,"A little too showy, but okay for fans.  Katherine shows versatility with her voice. Check out her other DVD's - they focus more on the voice, and less on the show.",1358380800,,163,4.258064516129032
4237806,4,B00403CLK0,"I expected the quality of a Sarah Brighten production, but not quite.  Still well worth the purchase.  She certainly has the voice of one in a million.",1357257600,,151,4.555555555555555
4237807,5,B00403CLK0,"Katherine is a very talented young woman.  Her performance at the O2 was outstanding.  I live in the USA and was unfamiliar with this wonderful woman's talents.  This DVD is super.  I love it and recommend it to others who enjoy Katherine's talents, but unable to see her ""live"".  I could watch this over and over.  Thank you Katherine.",1345334400,,336,4.610169491525424
4237808,5,B00403CLK0,I thought this DVD was wonderful.  I live in the USA and am not privileged to attend Katherine's performances in person.  What a talented and creative young woman.  Her performance at the O2 was outstanding.  I was so happy to be able to see it via the DVD.  Thank you Katherine.  Bring us more DVD's as well as your wonderful CD's.  I am a huge fan.,1345334400,2,350,4.212121212121212
4237809,2,B00403CLK0,This DVD was produced poorly with no shown titles at the beginning of each song and with no subtitles for the songs.  Few people could understand foreign languages especially during the songs being played.,1344643200,,205,5.029411764705882
4237810,5,B00403CLK0,This Blueray is exactly what we ordered and expected.  Katherine Jenkins is lovely.  Her voice is sweet and strong.  We love her and the Blueray disc very much.,1341446400,,160,4.642857142857143
4237811,5,B00403CLK0,"Katherine Jenkins brilliant in this and I watch it often.  However the flyer - Lorant Markoscany - is the real attraction, he is beautiful and so incredible to watch, This man is so talented - Katherine is beautiful, talented and is in the arms of this ""angel""  too much for one person. Watch the performance and enjoy Lorant - well worth the purchase.",1335571200,,352,4.571428571428571
4237812,4,B00403CLK0,"I learned about this British preformer form the Dr Who TV show, which she appeared on in one of the Christmas special shows as well. She has an amazing voice an is very beautiful as well!",1326326400,,187,4.222222222222222
4237813,5,B00403CLK0,"If you are a Katherine Jenkins fan, then you will want this DVD.  Simply stunning.

I have had friends that would never listen to classical music, see and hear this playing on my TV and beg to borrow it.",1325289600,4,203,4.17948717948718
4237814,5,B00403CLK0,"EXCELLENT dvd of the Believe Concert at the O2. Of course, the performer Katherine Jenkins rates 10++ as a mezzo-soprano who is bridging the gap between the classical and pop genres.

It doesn't hurt that she is a gorgeous lady as well......",1323388800,3,241,4.738095238095238
4237815,5,B00403CLK0,"I was introduced to Katherine on You-Tube. I was quite impressed and so ordered her concert at the O2. I pretty much agree with most others about her abilities. I usually prefer concerts that use other dancers and singers along with the star because I think that it makes the program more interesting. I look for pleasant voices that sings this type of music. I have never heard Nella Fantasia sung so beautifully before. I agree with some that she is not an opera singer. When I want opera, I buy opera. I personally prefer DVD's so I can see the performer as I listen. I recommend her.",1319155200,7,587,4.444444444444445
4237816,5,B00403CLK0,"As usual Katherine dishes up the unbelievable. Her voice, backed by a full symphony, cannot be beaten by any other mezzo soprano, or soprano in general. She lights up the stage with a performance of true beauty visually as well as vocally. I will watch this over and over and never get board of it. ENJOY!",1318809600,4,305,4.464285714285714
4237817,5,B00403CLK0,"This ie Katherine's third Music DVD. ""Live at LLangollen"" and ""Katherine ih the Park"" , which are the other Music DVDs  by Katherine Jenkins. These two are her singing with orchestra and the occasional duet with a tennor. Both leave you with a joyfull feeling. ""Believe: Live From The O2"", her third offering, still has the beautiful music,and her singing ie extraordinary. The stageing and showmanship make this show unique in the best possible way. She Flys while singing ""Angle"" with an acrobat. Very Good.",1309737600,,509,4.988235294117647
4237818,1,B00403CLK0,"This is by far the worst Popera/Classical Crossover DVD that I've ever seen and I have a large collection of them. I simply threw this out it's so bad. Katherine Jenkins has a great mezzo voice and a wonderful personality that sparkles in her two previous DVDs. Her ""Live In the park"" and ""Live at Llangollen"" DVDs are exceptional. Her CDs are exceptional. In this DVD, her voice is totally lost to over boosted background music.

Her producer is also sending Jenkins down the sad ""Sarah Brightmann path"" of performing in extreme floor shows with extreme lighting and dancers that are totally unrelated to why people like the performer and buy her music.

If you want to purchase a DVD of full of background music played by unknowns, a bunch of unknown dancers, a light show that makes it difficult to see Katherine Jenkins and you do not want to hear her sing, this is the DVD for you!",1303430400,7,886,4.566037735849057
4237819,5,B00403CLK0,"I first noticed Miss Jenkins while surfing through You Tube and wanted to see more. You Tube showed several excerpts from this concert at the huge O2 arena in London, which took place in March, 2010. I was struck by the colorful sets, the clever mimes and dancing extras that were featured, but most of all struck by Catherine Jenkins stunning outfits, her delightful British charm, and most of all, her incredible mezzo-soprano voice. If you like vocal artists in the vein of Sarah Brightman, Josh Groban and Andrea Bocelli, this concert is for you. I was just blown away!",1297900800,16,573,4.74
4237820,5,B00403CLK0,"Never having personally seen Katherine Jenkins in concert, I've only been able to appreciate her gifts through CD's and DVD's.  I have a growing collection of DVD's of various artists & genres. But I will say that this concert DVD is far and away the finest I have ever seen of ANY type !  Katherine desrves the oppulent settings here and she uses them to the fullest advantage.  The music, costumes, set changes, choreography and pacing make this the one NOT to miss !  When will the US start to appreciate her as much as the UK has ?  This DVD may be the start.  Thank you.",1297209600,,575,4.327102803738318
