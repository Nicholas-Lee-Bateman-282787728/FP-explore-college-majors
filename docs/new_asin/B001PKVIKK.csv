Very helpful for anyone wanting to better understand spectrum disorders.",1292025600,2,256,5.4
8333672,5,B001PKVIKK,"My favorite part about this video was its tone -- not too formal/academic, or too devastated-and-desperate-to-make-them-'normal'.  Everyone involved with this video seemed to love someone with Asperger's.  It does a good job of showing strengths and weaknesses that can come with this condition.  Bravo Strawbelly Jerry Films -- whoever you are!",1242691200,2,345,5.7254901960784315
