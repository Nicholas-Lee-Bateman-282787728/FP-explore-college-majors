2649364,2,B000I0RNU2,"Yeah, it is pretty bad.  But, since I am a video game collector (and movies) I am going to keep this in my collection.  There's good nudity (but it's mostly the sme 2 girls) and there are some funny parts (that actually made me laugh).  But, then again there are some really bad parts (where I actually had to fast forward), for example the court scene.  It is great to see the old games (they actually had a pretty good collection in that arcade; or was it a studio?; or maybe it was the studio they used for Starcade?).  The giant animated pac-man for the scene dissolves was a great idea.  The music was pretty bad except for the title song (that song rocks!).  The acting was pretty bad.  And as for the dvd itself the picture is very, very dark.  It was really hard to see some stuff.  And it is only full-screen.  The sound is quiet.  And there are no subtitles.  Extras are only a couple trailers.  Cover art is pretty bad (the original poster is much better).  That ""joystick"" on the cover doesn't even look like an Atari VCS controller (more like those cheap tv games controllers).  I do like the legs with the heels though.  So, it is pretty good for a nostalgic picture.  If only they made the dvd with better care.  There's not much static though (it does say ""digitally remastered"" on the cover).  Like I said this is a keeper, except I'm not sure if I will watch it again.",1166227200,8,1386,4.319066147859922
2649371,3,B000I0RNU2,"I remember seeing this in the theaters as a teenager and loving it...fast forward 30 years and my tastes have definitely changed. Really NOT much of a storyline...a surprisingly small set crammed with just a dozen or so stand up coin-op games...unnecessary nudity...the severely overacted ""valley girl"" stereotype...and ever hear of Jim Greenleaf? Me neither. Jim Greenleaf came along after Belushi and before Farley but never made it mainstream...pretty much unfunny, unsuccessful portrayal of your stereotypical overweight happy slob.

BY FAR the best thing about this movie is that Jon Gries is ""King Vidiot"" - yes, Uncle Rico himself in an early role - the anti-establishment blue-haired, spikes, chains and whips anti-hero.",1485734400,4,728,5.5

I understand the ideal of supply and demand, but when it comes to a DVD in modern times? Seriously? These things are so easy to reproduce that there should NEVER be a DVD selling for hundreds of dollars. I mean lets get real. Luckily I discovered a ""reasonable"" individual  who was selling a copy.

2649381,5,B000I0RNU2,"If you are a fan of 80s cheese, arcade clich&eacute;s, and occasional gratuitous, lighthearted toplessness, then this is the film for you! I was fortunate enough to find this gem as a VHS rental many years ago and instantly fell in love with it. Since then, I've gone out of my way to acquire multiple copies of it in several formats, as it's become the quintessential ""drinking movie"" romp of choice for my husband and me. Joysticks successfully captures the excitement of arcade gaming's golden years and the culture of teenage escapism and rebellion it represented. Throw in great cast chemistry, some charmingly bad acting, and a killer soundtrack (Jensen Farley Pictures: shut up and take my money!), and youve got one stellar cinematic time capsule.",1395705600,6,755,5.0

2649387,2,B000I0RNU2,"First off, this is a fun movie and highly recommended to fans of 80s teen comedies/low budget sex comedies.  It's pretty cheesy in a good way and is a movie I re-visit once in a while when I'm in the mood for some nostalgic 80s fun.  Sadly, the Scorpion Releasing DVD has a major video problem:  For the entire running time of the DVD the image is stretched slightly horizontally.  It's as if the master was 1.66:1 ratio but it was then stretched to 1.78:1.  You can tell that this is definitely a problem during the edits where Pac-Man crosses the screen, and Pac-Man is oval shaped!  This problem was also mentioned in a review I found on Mondo-Digital where they show a few screen grabs displaying this problem.

Aside from the above, there is a somewhat interesting interview with Greydon Clark where he talks about how Joysticks was created as well as some of the other movies he's made over the years.  I haven't yet listened to the audio commentary, so I can't comment on that.
There is a Joysticks trailer included that looks like it was taken from Youtube, very pixelated, and I stopped watching it after 5 seconds.  A waste of disc space.  There are also a few other trailers for some other Scorpion Releasing DVDs.

I would have given this DVD 5 stars, but the major video flaw will definitely knock the rating down for me.  I'm not sure if I'll even keep the DVD since the stretched image was so distracting to me.  This is not the first Scorpion Releasing disc with a major video problem:  POINT OF TERROR had a brutal ""crawling dot"" pattern that surrounded almost every edge on the screen and was nearly unwatchable, & QUEST FOR LOVE was probably from a PAL master and had severe motion blur.  Most of their other releases look great, however, so it's a shame that once in a while they put out a flawed release.",1358985600,6,1825,4.487878787878788
2649388,3,B000I0RNU2,"This is an average 80s production. It's fine for what it is, which means that if you are considering paying what this will cost it should be because you remember this movie from your youth and love it. Otherwise, it's just a way to spend some time.",1350604800,,248,4.297872340425532
2649389,4,B000I0RNU2,"Joysticks, you either love this movie or you hate it. I was a teenager in the 1980's, arcade games were fun and they kept me out of trouble. I'd cut grass all week after school and then I'd hit up to the local arcade for a little video game action on the weekends. My favorite games were Space Invaders, Galaxian and Pac-Man of course.

Patsy Rutter and her friends are constantly hanging out at the local video arcade run by Jefferson Bailey much to the displeasure of Patsy's father, local businessman Joseph Rutter. Patsy's father believes that the arcade is corrupting the minds of the local youth and he wants the arcade shut down for good. Mr. Rutter enlists the help of Jefferson Bailey's video game nemesis King Vidiot in a winner take all video game showdown. Will the employees and patrons allow the arcade to be shut down? Can Jefferson defeat King Vidiot in the final showdown?  Joysticks is 86 minutes of mindless fun with some gratuitous T & A and full frontal nudity thrown in for good measure. Enjoy!

This review is for the Scorpion Releasing 30th anniversary DVD edition of ""Joysticks"" It states that ""Joysticks"" is being presented in widescreen for the first time from a brand new master from the original vault elements. I'm not an expert on video remastering or video restoration but I can say that this new video transfer is far from perfect but still viewable. The new print still contains grain, speckling and picture debris such as lines and scratches; so maybe this is the best the original video elements could be cleaned up for this release. Overall I think Scorpion Releasing did a pretty good job with this release and I'm happy to add this DVD to my collection.

- Brand New 16X9 anamorphic (1.78:1) widescreen transfer

2649390,4,B000I0RNU2,"I owned the Liberation dvd for a couple years, and this new release from Scorpion Releasing is worth buying it again. I hate re-buying movies, but the upgrade in color and picture are worth it. The Liberation dvd is hardly even watchable. with the new dvd, it's like watching a whole new movie......a movie thats actually good!",1346976000,11,327,4.754385964912281
2649411,3,B000I0RNU2,"Having heard about this film from some arcade game enthusiasts, I thought I'd give it a look.  Well, the movie itself is amateurish and low budget, but I could see how a fan of arcade games would enjoy watching it.  The story is kind of stupid and the acting is not Oscar worthy by any stretch of the imagination.  There is a lot nudity, so depending on how you feel about that it could either make you want to watch it or not.  Mainly, I just wanted to warn people that the picture quality is not very good.  The picture is very soft, the colors are faded and it's very dark in some if not most scenes.  The movie is presented in 4:3 format, not sure if it was ever in widescreen, but it's not here.  There aren't really any extras to speak of either except for some trailers for other low budget movies I never heard of or have any interest in seeing.  If it sounds like I'm steering you away from this one, I am, although I will say for the curious it's worth renting once, but not owning.",1329091200,,992,4.157068062827225
2649412,2,B000I0RNU2,"Like most people who have been reviewing this, I found this due to a trip down memory lane flash back. I rented this god knows how long ago, sometime during the very early 90's, and all I had remembered was the arcade and boobs bouncing around... back in those days, when i was about 9 or 10, I thought this movie was cool because it was so dirty and showed things I shouldn't have been watching... but now that I have seen it again... the boobs weren't going back for!!! HAHAHA

This is one of those low-budget independent movies of the 1980's that had a very thin script, but the nudity was meant to draw suckers in and hope for the best. This one see's a guy who is the son or nefue of a video game arcade owner, and while the owner is away... well, the kids play videogames, but they don't play much else. A dork comes in for his first day at working in the Arcade (played by the same dork from Grease 2), and for no reason has his pants pulled down and a Polaroid taken of it... might have been funnier had they pulled more then his pants down leaving him in his briefs. He discovers another guy who works at the arcade, and is the main guys (the nefue left in charge) best friend who plays a character that is trying way too hard to be John Belushi in Animal House.

A young teenage girl (Corinne Bohrer - Zeds girlfriend in Police Academy 4) shows up to the arcade with a god awful valley girl accent. Her characters voice in this is so annoying... did anyone really ever talk like that? Sometimes people say they wish they could go back and live in the 80's, but if I ran into her, i'd be kicking Doc Brown in the nuts until he brought me back to the future.... anyway, her father (Joe Don Baker - Lot's of films)is a big uptight business man who doesn't like that his daughter has an interest in the opposite sex, so he tries to sabotage the place with the aid of his two moron nefue', then tries to have the place shut down... the whole plot is pretty much taken from Meatballs... or at least one of the Meatball movies.... you know, a place where kids have fun, one adult doesn't like it, but he can't shut it down cause it's actually a great place... that sort of thing. You've seen it before, and this is nothing original either.

Sure, there is a few boobs to see, and overacting naked bimbo's pretending to have such a happy smiling 'totally awesome' time playing the games... sigh, like anyone would be that happy, chirpy and bouncy playing Pac-Man? I guess that may be a reason this movie has a small cult like following, or more a nostalgic value to it for those around in the 1980's when arcade places where just starting to pop up around the world. If for some reason you are excited to know that game footage of Pac-Man, Defender and Pole Position are in a movie... then you probably already own this cheaply made VHS transfer to DVD release. As for the rest... look, I like a lot of the cheesy 80's flicks like ""Cave Girl"" , ""Hollywood Hut-tubs"", ""The Beach Girls"", ""Screwballs"" and even ""Loose Screws"", each one of them in some way wanted to be the next Animal House of Porkys... but this one, ya know, you probably could describe it as those movies set in a video arcade... but the comedy and replay value are not found in this one. Unless a reason to watch this interested you, then you probably will want to skip this one. It's far from the worst movie of all time, but if you made a list of cheesy 80's films with little plot but boobs thrown in to try and attract teenagers, then this one would be somewhere lower down the list... probably not the bottom, but fairly low.",1315785600,3,3599,4.28193832599119
2649413,1,B000I0RNU2,"I agree with the other guy that said not to watch this and save your $13.49 - this film is bad in every sense of the word. Bad story, bad dialogue, bad acting, and bad direction. I bought this mainly so I could take it to the 2010 Classic Gaming Expo and have director Greydon Clark sign it. He wouldn't do it unless I paid him, so no signature. After getting home, I thought I would at least watch the film....and I'm sorry I did. What a terrible movie. There are actually a few decent actors in early roles, but they must have not learned their craft yet, because the acting in this turkey is bad across the board. Even J.D. Baker sucks in this. If you're feeling nostalgic, fire up MAME and actually play a few rounds of Super Pac-Man or Satan's Hollow (featured in the film) and save your money instead of wasting it on this dreck. AVOID!!!!",1281398400,,845,4.2875
2649414,4,B000I0RNU2,"This is a fun trip down memory lane if your in to the like totally awesome 80's,or the early days of gaming, the movie was not as good as I remembered it to be, its really goofy and cheesy, and was an independent movie even back then, but it did take me back to the days of the first arcades, when in my town at least, it was a really underground thing, the arcade close to my house was actually a nondescript door in a self storage lot, where you entered in to complete darkness except for the glow of the games lining the walls exposing the mass of paisty teens with mullets reeking of b.o. and herb. I was disappointed with the transfer or print quality with this one, I wish they had remastered it better, I don't think they made any effort at all, and extras would have been fun for this as well, but I doubt this will make it to Blu Ray and will probably be out of print in the next year, so I'll take what I can get.",1281139200,3,923,4.021739130434782
2649415,1,B000I0RNU2,"I'm ashamed to have ordered this movie.  Saw it as a kid.  All I remembered was the video arcade and the gratuitous shots of breasts bouncing around while playing video games.  Movie came up in conversation so I came to Amazon, which has everything, and ordered it.

This movie has to rank as one of the worst ever.  To give you an idea of how bad, think 80s, Southern California, Valley Girl, punk rocker, a computer nerd, and a fat guy who has to be at least 450lbs all dancing in a circle watching two women who have clearly seen better days bounce up and down while topless and playing a video game.

There, I just saved you 86 minutes of your life and $13.49.  Use the money to fund my psychotherapy classes, which I now need, after sitting through this trash 80s movie.",1235692800,2,775,4.340277777777778

If you go into it with the same attitude as you would when watching any of the horrible college comedy movies of today you'll be able to get through it.

It's pretty typical of the T&A genre that was popular in the early 80's, but remains entertaining because of its general oddness and its glimpse into the arcade game craze of the time. Jon Gries (Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite) is a hoot as the Vidiot and it's fun to see John Volstadt (Darryl #2 from Newhart) in a role that allows him to have lines. Don't expect art. This ain't it. Still, for a boob-filled time capsule from the 80's, it's quite enjoyable.

CAVEAT: The streaming version currently on the site is pretty severely cropped. It was shot open-matte and framed for 1.85:1 but this version cuts off some of the opening titles on the sides, indicating it has been oddly zoomed in.
