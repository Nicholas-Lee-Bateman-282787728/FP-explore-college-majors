5544202,3,B00B1CGEI8,"I love John Wayne, so anything he is in is fine with me. On the other hand the script was somewhat weak. Frances Dee is beautiful and a much under rated actress. They were good together. One note. When he throws her over his shoulder and carries her that was supposed to be a stunt woman, but Duke surprised he and that was her. Something she and her husband Joel McCrea laughed at for many years. The two stars carry the film. It is good seeing Duke as a young man. Thought I saw all his films till this popped up.",1404518400,5,515,4.108910891089109

It was not one of his best but still entertaining.  There was noithing I disliked about it. I recomend it to all John Wyne fans if they can find it.",1389312000,3,283,3.716666666666667
5544207,5,B00B1CGEI8,In this movie Francis Dee is stunning beautiful! Wearing a broad brimmed hat framing her face she is a knockout. She could have been a good scarlett in GWTW and she tested for it.,1376438400,8,179,4.294117647058823

8560603,2,B00B1CGEI8,"An unsuccessful change of pace from John Wayne's traditional Western fare. The Duke and Frances Dee display engaging chemistry, but this offbeat romantic comedy-drama never gels. Republic simply didn't have the production values to pull it off.",1444867200,,244,5.621621621621622

8560605,4,B00B1CGEI8,"A Man Betrayed, 1941 film

Leaflets for Club Inferno are given to the public. Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here. A man walks across the street in the rain. A lightning bolt strikes a lamp post, a man falls to the street. Lightning? No, a .38 through the lungs says a policeman. Who robbed him? DAmato explains to the boss what happened: a sore loser at a crooked dice table. The Boss decides it was a suicide. He tells the editor of The Globe. [Most people only know what they read in the newspapers.] A lawyer arrives in Temple City to argue with the insurance company. This is his first case. Mr. Hollister visits the Cameron estate. [There is humor.] One room has a model railroad. A police escort follows Miss Cameron to Club Inferno. They show a dance number. Honest dice are used to let some win. Lynn spent $20 in travelers checks.

Miss Cameron drinks a French 75, Lynn orders coffee. [Is there anything in it?] Cameron tells DAmato he is through, he causes a jam up. Hollister fires a pistol to see if anyone notices it with the noise; they dont. Cameron tells him that death was suicide, and he should return home. Hollister decides to stay and help Cameron in the election. The Progressive Party speaker recommends Slade as a candidate for Council. The newspapers predict a victory on Election Day. Cameron provides Free Food in the River Wards. [Vote early and vote often?] Lynn questions a man why he shot Johnny Smith. He is shot but shoots his shooter! Slade is no longer Councilman. This shakes up the Combination, they no longer support Boss Cameron. Will he leave the city for South America? No. There is a report about a scandal where thirty people died of Typhoid. Cameron confesses! His henchmen are exposed. Johnny Smith wasn't a suicide! This helps the Governor. Lynn drives away with Miss Cameron. Others leave for Spring Valley.

This is a rare story about big city political corruption (where economic power controls peoples votes) combined with comedy. Some of John Waynes movies used comedy to offset the dramatic action. Comedys loss was action movies gain. This movie is rarely seen on TV or as part of a movie collection. Why? Its good, the subject matter makes it better than average. But no movie will explain the causes of political corruption, economic inequality. The lower crime rates in rural areas are due to lower population density and higher economic equality. Would perfect equality result in no crime? Human error is ever with us. [Also titled ""Wheel of Fortune"".]",1429660800,,2509,4.723744292237443
