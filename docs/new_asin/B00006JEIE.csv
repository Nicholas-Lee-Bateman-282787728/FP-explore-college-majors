I am a current breast cancer patient that was looking for a complimentary therapy to help me reduce my stress level while I was going through chemotherapy.

My doctor recommended that I explore a method that focused on mind, body and spirit.  I stumbled upon Steve's dvd series and was amazed at how it put me in a calm state almost immediately.  The guided imagery sections were so soothing and relaxing that I felt completely at peace and any tension that I was holding was one.  As a result I have not had any of the side effects that most people have with chemotherapy.  The visual images are absolutely beautiful and vibrant.  During one of the segments, I was convinced that the images leapt off of the screen and surrounded me with healing light.  Everytime I watch the dvd, I am further empowered to be able to fight this disease.

My oncology staff at UCLA's Cancer Center acknowledge the effective support the mind/body connection have as an aide in fighting this disease and Steve had perfected the tried and true art of visualization. I have been asked to speak at an awards dinner for the American Cancer Society, in which we will honor 5 individuals who have made great strides in promoting cancer awareness and patient support and I will certainly speak well of Steve Murray's Cancer Guided Imagery programs.
