3498684,5,B001BSBBRQ,"Here are 6 films in black and white or if you prefer, the colorized version. Colorization of these films was done to perfection so not sure why other consumers had issues. I am a huge John Wayne fan so am thrilled to add this set to my already large John Wayne collection of films--recommended!!!",1395446400,4,296,4.5
3498685,5,B001BSBBRQ,"John Wayne is a favorite of mine. I have a large collection of his shows and watch them often. I have these movies in black and white, but the color makes them appear better. They arrived timely and in good condition. Thanks.",1395100800,8,225,4.380952380952381
3498686,1,B001BSBBRQ,This had new titles on it so thought it was movies I had not seen or owned.  After I got it I realized they just added color and changed the names of the original movies to seem new.,1377302400,,182,3.789473684210526
3498687,2,B001BSBBRQ,I love John Wayne but these movies were old movies with the titles changed.  I thought I was getting movies I had never seen before but I already have these movies.  They are colorized with different titles and I was very disappointed.,1374969600,8,235,4.571428571428571
3498688,5,B001BSBBRQ,"I love John Wayne but normally the b-movies he made in the 30's are in such bad condition they are almost not watchable except for the most hard core fan. Legend did a wonderful job on cleaning up the sound and video on these classics. Each volume shows the movie in color and you also get the restored B&W Version. I must admit that I enjoyed watching them in color for the first time. The restored B&W version look really good too. They did some new editing of  the films to make the flow better and added a sound track to them. I personally found the sound track and tightening up on the edits to make a big difference. It is the first time I found these old movies to be easy, fun and enjoyable to watch. Great job legend I would like see you do it with more of these movies.",1357171200,12,779,4.125
3498689,1,B001BSBBRQ,"On No. Not again. Dont tell me they are going to release the Black and White John Wayne classics in colar?Didnt we have enough with Casablanca,Maltese Falcon(Blue Skies in a Film Noir?I don't think so)Suddely(Frank Sinatra has brown eyes),Captain Blood,White Heat(The flames from the oil tanker as Cagney shoots it out with the TMen look very phoney to me)etc
I think they should not mess with perfection.
Stick with the black and white.",1322092800,5,437,5.0

3498698,4,B001BSBBRQ,"A collection of John Wayne B movies. As a JW fan it's worth having in your western collection. Mill Creek does a good job on the color transfer and though it's not pristine it's still a very good transfer. What do you expect from movies that were made in the 60's. Wayne is young and still carries the arrogance of a man who knows what he can do when the chips are down.
