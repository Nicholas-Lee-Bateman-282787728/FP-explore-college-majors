8559327,5,B00AYOCOKG,"This show came out at the perfect time; right as I graduated from university. Although the show never acquired much of an audience, the few people that connected with it could truly relate to what all the characters went though. Would highly recommend this show for anyone at university or college, or has recently graduated.",1447804800,,325,4.927272727272728

8559329,5,B00AYOCOKG,"This show is honestly one of my favorites. People can relate to the situations that happen in the show. It has the right amount of drama, while delivering  couple of laughs here and there. I always looked forward to Tuesday nights because of this show. And believe me, i know MTV doesn't deliver the best shows on TV, but this one was worth watching.",1359590400,3,350,4.46875
