8746931,3,B01AB4Y780,"Albert Up, Up, and Away! is a cute animated DVD for younger kids that delivers positive messages about friendship, kindness and making smart choices.  The stories revolve around two best friends, Albert and Egon and the adventures they share.  Not an average kid Albert learned to walk and talk at two months old.  He has a tenacity for getting into trouble but never on purpose. His parents knew he would change the world one day. Years pass and Albert decides he wants get an air balloon and become its captain so he can replace the statue that he accidentally destroyed when he was younger.  His best friend Egon wants to become a pirate captain. However, a mean bandit takes advantage of the bewildered boys and wants them to help him steal the worlds biggest diamond. Together they have to face this obstacle while their adventure develops.

This is a good film. The animation is well done but I found myself comparing it to other animated and it scores about average. I liked it although the storyline was too predictable for me, and the pace a bit slow. It is definitely better suited for a much younger audience. I recommend it for ages 3 to 7. It has good, clean humor and lots of action scenes, which younger kids would enjoy.

The menu offers scene selection, trailers and setup. Or you can just play the film.  I enjoyed the scene selection feature because it makes it easy to return to where you left off. I enjoyed the trailer because it filled me in on what the movie looks like and gave me the general idea about the film before I started watching it.

I give this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it to people who like action, adventure and children films. It is now available now on DVD so, so go check it out.",1461542400,,1731,4.455696202531645
8746932,4,B01AB4Y780,"The film opens as we watch one of Nena's 99 luftballoons float into Kelly Town. Albert is born and a proud dad shows the town by holding Albert out over a balcony. Albert quickly grows up in the film and as a toddler he accidentally destroys the town statue of an air balloon captain. Albert and his friend leave town to be the captain of a hot air balloon and fly it back to town and also be pirates.

I am not sure if everything in the film has a positive message for kids. The kids want to steal and form a scoundrels club where they kidnap girls and hold them in their basement...but they wouldn't have to kiss them. The film is a French version of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, taking place in an older time period and place not well defined.

Good 3D graphics. An easy film to watch.",1457136000,2,785,4.157894736842105
