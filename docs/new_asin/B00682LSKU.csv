4972525,5,B00682LSKU,"I have just finished watching this film The Assailant by director Joao Danial tikhomiroff,it shows that in-spite of the oppressive environment the slaves were in, their was always the spirit to rise above their oppression, by blending both the spiritual, mental and the physical through movement to develop a lethal weapon to protect themselves from their oppressors and instill a spirit of resistance and awareness, in bringing together the African/Brazilian people in the fight for their ultimate liberation, every young person of African decent should see this film as an educational text and a historically relevant event. Every parent of Black children the world over owe it to your children to insure that they see this film, if you don't then the next time your child become involved in negative conduct don't ask yourself why! Why this film was passed over in the United States by our Black media leave a serious question to be answered by you! a must see!",1359072000,11,964,4.9937888198757765

So little has been publicized about this graceful form of ""Kung Fu"" developed by African slaves in Brazil to keep fit and sharpen their self defense skills all the while pretending they were just dancing.

4972527,5,B00682LSKU,"Oh My GOSH! This movie is terrific! Why it did not show in the United States or at least in my region is beyond me. There is action, drama, and some relatively accurate history. The story is about Beetle, a young fighter however, much deeper than that is the story of struggle and reconciliation after the end of Portuguese slavery and the succession of the African Holocaust. It presents action unlike any that I have seen in film featuring 'black' actors and definitely delves into history unlike movies generally propagated in the United States and other countries. The perspective is self determining and not one of the conquistador.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Besouro/dp/B008MNFA4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Besouro</a>",1356480000,2,773,5.972972972972973

Since then, capoeira has firmly cemented itself into the martial arts scene, especially in film, but while there has been no shortage of kickboxing and MMA flicks since then, I don't believe that any movie between 1993 and 2009's ""The Assailant"" (AKA ""Besouro"") has exclusively highlighted the art. Disappointingly, we may need to wait even longer for a genuinely good capoeira vehicle, because while this Brazilian-made film is about as legitimate as it can be, it falls victim to some crazy creative decisions and damaging false advertising.

The story: Following the murder of a capoeira master and community leader in a 1920s Bahia town, his best student (Ailton Carmo) receives a revelation to fight against the oppressors of the Afro-Brazilian community.

All covers to the film that I have seen seem to indicate that this is a martial arts action movie, but it's best to know beforehand that this is not really the case. First and foremost, this is a historical drama that examines the racial injustices of post-slavery Brazilian society, with some fantasy on the side and a dessert-sized helping of action. This isn't&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-Years-a-Slave/dp/B00G4Q3KOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12 Years a Slave</a>&nbsp;but there's enough violence, cruelty, and racial slurs to make for some uncomfortable scenes. In the middle of things, the story takes a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B000O76ZQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>-esque detour into absurdity, with spirits that only certain characters can see and the lead character turning into a frog and communing with ghosts. It's jarring and inharmonious to say the least, and not written well enough to make any sense at all.

Among the abilities of these spirits is apparent weightlessness, and this demonstrates another quirk among the filmmakers' decisions. The action is choreographed by Hong Kong stunt lord Huan-Chiu Ku (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/14-Blades/dp/B00L6AW20E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">14 Blades</a>), and his involvement is either the best or worst thing about the film, depending on your preferences. Instead of keeping the already fantastical displays of capoeira grounded, Ku brings in the wires to let the characters makes superhuman bounds and fly - literally fly. This is not to say that there are no fights more realistic than that - half of the four exchanges tend to remain on the ground - but nevertheless, it seems like a waste to dilute the potential of such a singular fighting style with wirework.

Despite these criticisms, the acting is fairly strong, some of the locations are beautiful, and even though the screenplay could be a lot tighter, the film is never boring. These positives help earn the film a positive rating, although it's far from the most enthusiastic one I could give. ""The Assailant"" is a singular movie, though not for reasons that I would have wanted. I hope that Ailton Carmo sees more work as an action actor, but if I never saw this film again, I would not be heartbroken. Take it or leave it.",1438819200,5,3418,5.926977687626775
