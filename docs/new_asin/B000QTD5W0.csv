8197329,2,B000QTD5W0,"I got this before they came out with Wii Fit. I liked the idea of dancing away the fat. I don't like to waste money going to the gym, and I'd rather workout at home.  I could not get the steps. It was going way to fast and I didn't have the patience to do it in slow motion, over and over. I think joining a class or trying the wii fit would be more successful!",1306108800,3,361,3.75
8197330,2,B000QTD5W0,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the women in the back of this video are a bit lead-footed.

The thing I found the most jarring about this workout is that the speed at which the instructor wants you to do the workout has nothing to do with the music they're playing. I felt that if this is to be a ""dance"" workout, that the music should be on beat with the speed of the ""Dance"" that you're learning.

Don't get me wrong, it will make you sweat - and it's a decent workout. But - I was disappointed with the dancing (I thought it wasn't faithful enough to real Hip Hop dancing. It was almost an outsider's look at Hip Hop, as though the instructor were ""classically"" trained in dancing, but had no real taste for the flavor of the style), and disappointed with the dancers trio not wanting to stay on the beat with the music that was playing. If you don't have an ear for rhythm, this probably won't bother you, but I have no intentions of keeping or doing this workout again.",1289865600,,980,4.263440860215054
8197331,4,B000QTD5W0,I enjoyed this hip hop workout.  The instructions are clear and the moves are easy to follow.,1288483200,,93,4.470588235294118
8197332,3,B000QTD5W0,"This is the second DVD that I've bought from Denise Druce's Fitness Essentials series, the first featuring perhaps the worst bellydance instructor on this planet, and deserving of the one-star reviews it received.
Here's how I gave this one three stars:
Dancer Cory Rivers gives a five-star performance.
Producer Denise Druce merits negative 2 stars.
Cory's dance moves are clear, crisp, and well-defined, but fast-paced and complex. His clothing is simple so one can see and analyze where he places his center of gravity. It's a joy to see him pull together the low center of the tapdancer with the undulating torso of a Brazilian samba dancer.
But...
It's definitely NOT ""for beginners""! If you can analyze dance for yourself, you'll be able to do this workout well. If you can't, too bad - Denise forgot to tell Cory to break down any moves at all!
Who is the woman on the front of the package? Who knows!
Who are Heather and Darla, the lead-footed goofs behind Cory?
Why is Cory never mentioned on the package?
Why does the set serve as a low-budget commercial for Fitness Essentials?
Where is that Bonus Section promised in the text?
Nevertheless, I'm keeping the tape. For Cory.",1219104000,2,1184,4.8088235294117645
