8353173,4,B0026LYMAA,"I enjoy spaghetti westerns. They are very different than the American westerns, the actors, their facial expressions, the humor, the action, the music, the dress. In this film, Arizona Colt is blamed for a murder he did not commit and is sentenced to be hung. He is saved by his sidekick who is a drunk, who drinks so much that although he received three gunshot wounds, all of which the doctor said is mortal, he survives.
Arizona meets a beautiful woman and tells her and her father that he will marry her and have six sons.
A bad man with a gang of about two dozen kidnap the daughter of a friend of Arizona and the friend requests that Arizona get her back. Neither the father nor Arizona know that the daughter is in love with the bandit chief.
Arizona steals a huge amount of gold from the bandit chief and is captured by him. He refuses to reveal where he hid the gold, so the bandit chief captures the woman who Arizona wants to marry to force Arizona to reveal the whereabouts of the gold.
Arizona needs to fight against the two dozen bandits with only a pistol that doesn't seem to run out of bullets until it does, after virtually all, but not all, of the bandits are killed.
The film ends with Arizona and his sidekick riding off into the sunset with a boy calling after him as a boy did in the famed Shane movie.",1503878400,,1325,4.325301204819277

8353176,4,B0026LYMAA,"A early 70's Euro-made, Italian-language western with optional sub-titles (aka Arizona Colt Hired Gun) is about a somewhat dirty and sweaty good guy saddle tramp who is accused of a crime by a gang of ruthless bad guys who want a clear field to the West.  The film has a silly theme song.
The MYA DVD is very good quality.  The transfer is clear and the color is beautiful.  Recommended for Spaghetti Western fans.",1452470400,,414,4.5675675675675675

8353178,5,B0026LYMAA,"Mya Communications has come through once again with this enjoyable release from director Sergio Martino.  Not quite as good as his other Spaghetti,'MANNAJA-A MAN CALLED BLADE', it shows his incredible, visual panache and excellent balance of gallows humor and biting grit.  This film could be a direct sequel to Michele Lupo's 1966 release 'ARIZONA COLT' also released by Wild East Productions as 'THE MAN FROM NOWHERE'.  Guiliano Gemma played the hero in that one and the always excellent Anthony Steffen steps into his boots in this entry. Some of the same actors appear in this one as well, Roberto Camardiel plays the side kick 'Double Whiskey', Jose Manuel Martin shows off his same sour puss and the breathtaking Rosalba Neri plays both sides of good and bad with her usual aplomb. Aldo Sambrell gives his character just the right touch of sneering villainy as Keene, Arizona's old nemesis from the past. It boasts a screenplay from Ernesto Gastaldi who helmed some of the best Giallo and Italian Horror films of the sixties. Keene frames Arizona by accusing him of horse thievery thereby concocting a plan along with a wealthy ranchers daughter to have Arizona put to death and steal a fortune in gold so they can live happily ever after but Arizona has other plans. The only thorn in the side is the uneven music score by Morricone alumnus Bruno Nicolai who gives the film a ridiculous theme song which shows up at the most uneventful times and yet sprinkles some suspenseful and rousing passages as if there were two different scores for two separate films. The box lists an aspect ratio of 2.35 but it really is 1.85 with a sharp,clean picture and good Italian soundtrack with English subtitles.  Its a great movie for anyone who loves Westerns and shows that Sergio Martino deserves more accolades as one of Italy's best directors.",1281225600,2,1842,4.875399361022364
8353179,5,B0026LYMAA,"ARIZONA COLT RETURNS (aka Arizona Lets Fly and Kills Everybody; Arizona; If You Gotta Shoot Someone...Bang! Bang!; Arizona Colt Si Scatena...E Li Fece Fuori Tutti) is first and foremost a very entertaining movie.  The unfailing combination of solid plot, humor, irony, excellent performances and explicit violence make this one of the better Italo westerns.
Anthony Steffen ( Antonio de Teffe), the star, was the perfect cinematic gunslinger.",1258070400,,442,5.597014925373134
8353180,3,B0026LYMAA,"\Italian name of ARIZONA COLT RETURNS: ""Arizona si scaten&ograve;... e li fece fuori tutti.""

Westerns just don't get any more 'Euro' than this one. There's not an English-speaking actor in sight and no mediocre dubbing here. If you don't understand Italian you'll have to rely on the provided subtitles. As is usual with the genre, Spanish scrub country stands in nicely for the American wild west.

SYNOPSIS--
In this sequel (with a new star), 'Arizona Colt' is not your typical eagle-eyed gunslinger-- he's really kinda lazy. His dumpy, comic-relief sidekick 'Double Whiskey' has easily scarfed down four hundred too many servings of mostaccioli rigati. Yah gotta feel for the guy's poor horse!

There's a thousand buck bounty on Arizona (don't expect Eastwood and Van Cleef to show up here!). An unmotivated marshal actually takes Arizona into custody after a lady bar owner knocks him unconscious with a whiskey bottle. Our anti-hero escapes with his crappy theme music in tow and Marshal Who-gives-a-dang can't be bothered going after him.

Mr. Colt steals loot from the banditos' hideout, the gang comes after him, unshaven smelly guys with bad-looking teeth die, and so on. You've seen it all before, yes? Well, maybe not in the original Italiano....

Speaking of Clint and Lee... why not buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FOR-A-FEW-DOLLARS-MORE/dp/0792839056/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE</a>&nbsp;(1965) instead? It's got gunslingers, ugly-looking fly-infested hombres, a stash of stolen money and an unforgettable Ennio Morricone score.
