3682864,4,B001LF36AO,"This DVD gives very thorough, step by step instruction on all the aspects of reading Tarot. The instruction is supplemented by onscreen information and graphics to increase understanding. It not only teaches you to read the cards, but also suggests ways to make the most of your own reading. The sound quality is a little rough in places, but it's otherwise very easy to follow.",1233705600,6,378,4.8307692307692305
3682865,5,B001LF36AO,"This is an educational and entertaining guide to reading tarot cards. I learned what each group cups, swords, wands and pentacles stands for and how to interpret each of them. I also learned where to place the cards and what they symbolize in different spreads. I really enjoyed this film it was easy to understand but also full of detailed information. After watching this DVD I feel that I can read my own tarot cards.",1233619200,13,420,4.613333333333333
8317912,5,B001LF36AO,"Unfortunately I have not been able to view the video at this juncture.  I purchased ""Tarot Stripped Bare""  because I have a hard time tying the cards together as a story.  All I seem to be able to do is look at what is on the board and give a brief synopsis.  I know the person would rather have a long story with mystical symbolism.  I just cannot do that.  So to that end, I purchased this video.  I am sure it will meet all my expectations",1458691200,,442,4.011494252873563

8317914,3,B001LF36AO,"I really wanted a dvd that told you what the meaning of the cards meant, but this really didn't go through the cards. The dvd had bad sound quality and you could barely hear what they were saying, also the dvd centered more on how to do tarot readings as to the meaning of the cards. My advice is to stick with your tarot books and your own intuition.",1395360000,2,351,4.101449275362318
8317915,3,B001LF36AO,This is allright but in some of the video it is hard to hear what they are saying about the reading and I will just put it with my tarot book collection..,1385164800,2,154,3.84375
8317916,3,B001LF36AO,"This is a really basic DVD, but it does say stripped bare, so the description is perfect. I do enjoy watching other people do readings, so in that sense, it was ok.",1382140800,,164,4.15625
8317917,5,B001LF36AO,"I learned the tarot using this instructional DVD. I learned it quickly, and after studying it for some time now I have realized just how wonderful this was, so I figured I should leave a review. It is accurate, & interesting, and will teach you tarot very easily. I'd rather learn visually than read about tarot--if you are a visual learner this is a must have.",1374883200,,361,4.484848484848484
8317918,5,B001LF36AO,"I watched this video with my gf, and we found it to be really good. She has been into tarot for a long time while I'm new to it and we both were very entertained.",1360022400,,162,3.657142857142857
8317919,5,B001LF36AO,"I have always been interested in learning tarot...this was exactly what I was looking for.  It was interesting & informative.  I feel confident now in my readings, and enjoy doing readings for friends as well.",1356566400,,209,4.942857142857143
8317920,3,B001LF36AO,I was disapointed in that the DVD didn't go into the major and minor arcana. Or that they only did a few readings which did not include the celtic cross. The information is very limited.,1355011200,2,186,4.3428571428571425
8317921,4,B001LF36AO,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  It is very good for beginners but it has useful information for anyone.  The pace is slow enough to follow but not so slow that it drags. Plus it is setup in segments that you can go back to a specific area without having to go through the whole movie.  It dispells some myths with the notes in between segments.  I like how it takes a novice and has her give her idea of what a card means and then has an experienced person to give her follow-up.  The DVD has different readers so you get to see more than one style.  It has useful back up segments like ""layouts"" and ""card meanings"".  My only suggestion is it could have used a little more information.  I've heard some say something about ""cleansing"" before use and between readings and I would have liked to hear something on that issue.  I found this to be a good addition to my learning tools.  I will share this with friends.",1300233600,2,910,4.269005847953216
