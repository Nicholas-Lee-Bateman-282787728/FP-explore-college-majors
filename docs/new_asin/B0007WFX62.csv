2246636,5,B0007WFX62,"Totally Awesome  Set:
The Box is well done, and All high quality. The Visuals on the box are beyond Brilliant.
Fans will  love the Extra in Disc pack 3, TRINITY, the Comic has an Awesome Sensuality that would never be allowed on film, and is probably why so many film makers get inspired by comics to do  some amazing things in the world of film.
Totally Worth getting this set(Very Nice 3D feel to the actual box itself,as well).
As to the Content: The Gore is neither minimal, nor excessive, it is pretty appropriate for the films( after all we are talking about Vampires, and only one character actually bleeds non-red blood). Marvel's logo is on the start of film three, and a point is made of mentioning this, possibly because the original BLADE is in some respects not so well  known; but so what? Wesley Snipes as BLADE , makes this character work so well; So does his stunt double as well( if you check out the commentaries and the features, this point is covered additonally).
Also, the DVD menus and general structure are very good in my view; to say that they were put together by a 3 year old geek is either stupid, or shows that the person did not see the films; if the latter, then this is more of the reviews done by some who deliberately pan films  without seeing them ... something that should be stopped. ANYWAYS... for the fans this set is a treat.
*********************
BLADE

This film is great from start to finish, and has some severely superb DVD  extras. I first saw it on VHS, and even in that format, BLADE  was a great show.
Its clear after seeing, the film, and listening to the features, and the commentary that the film benefits extensively  from audience  test screenings. I won't say much, but the fine details of the story, were made so fine because of the test screenings.
As good as Wesley Snipes is, its clear from his comments that he benefits greatly  from some of the best Stunt men in the business. Not to say that Snipes is not a Good  Martial Arts practitioner, simply that the finer points of the action we see are very well executed by people who are part of the movie magic process. This does not detract  from the film, but explains how the stunt men provide some finesse from years of work, and Snipes ends up being the face of the quality, but I guess that the way it works out.
The DVD audio is truly great in 5.1 and probably  better in DTS. The commentary is overly detailed, and has some powerhouse editing by who-ever put the comments  together. It also illustrates the creative input of Snipes as the film came together. As the cliche states, the film process is a group effort, and wow  what a fine product.
The wow  value of the film is even  more powerful when looking at the behind scenes work, that show that ideas present, but deleted in the first film, become manifest in the later two.
I sure hope this  does not become a TV series. The overall Blade feel is more a movie style, and the work of the cast is part of the magic. The picks of the people in this film, such as Kris Kristofferson are just perfect, and work well in this film, and in the others.

*******************************************
BLADE 2

The story in this film is very ornate, and its not as gratuitous as some might want you to believe. Blade and Co are summoned to help the regular Vampires fight off a ""Common Enemy"", which is part of a story that has many twists and turns.
Overall, its indeed very cool, is a notch up from the first BLADE, but has the ""Del Toro"" factor; that is, Del Toro seems to know he is ramping up a Franchise, but he also adds his own little twists and, in a word, perversions. Possibly the key addition to this world, is Del Toro's attempt to remove the sub-text of why Vampires do what they do, and to change the ""Anne Rice"" factor.
The DVD  extras are superbly plentiful in this  set. Two Sets of commentaries on disc one ( go for the Wesley Snipes and David  Goyer commentary first, in my view, since that is the most entertaining, and Del Toro's and Frankfurt's commentary is basically a lot of stuff that might be something you need to know as a fan, but not as a movie fan, maybe as a movie maker, and certainly shows that an excess of perversion never stopped amnyone from making good films).
Disc two has two main sections. There is no doubt that Del Toro is creative, however his little obsessions are a tad too much when viewed and heard in this context. The Making of Section is probably the best item to view first. And in the out-takes and deleted  scenes, the commentary is sometimes useful, but is often just plain off the yuck scale. So, its good to see the deletes and out-takes, which are, I think ( my opinion) mostly done correctly, some deletes are just on the level of ""Why?"", and the out-takes are fun.
All in all a pretty excellent Value Package. Done before Del Toro did  HELLBOY, it is very illustrative of his creative skill and indulgence in some weird obsessions.

*******************************************
BLADE 3:
This Unrated version is quite good. Going on the commentaries and features, quite a bit of the Good Material was Chopped out for no decent  reason. The advantage is that Goyer as writer-director and creator of Blade as we Know him, is in the unique position of being inside the films as no other person can be. About all I would have changed is the start and finish credits, especially the end section which has some material that is just so out of character for the style of film; as some say, which might be true in this case, too many cooks spoil the broth. However, overall this film is a gem.
The commentaries with Goyer, and part of the features , explain why Blade is in the current  Predicament, but needless to say this is a step up from the standard Blade world. Especially with the Directors technique of using up to 7 or 8 cameras at any one time.
The criticism of Jessica Biel is really just sour Grapes, she pulls off the hyper fit  and well trained Vampire hunter in a way few could do. She really does fulfill  her role in many ways, so the criticism are not in my view valid.
Good DVD  Menu's, very inspired.
DISK 1:  The Extras here are two sets of commentaries. Neither of which live up to what they could be, but Goyer with Ryan and Jessica is the lesser of the two. Commentary 2, much more in the technical realm, and perhaps in some  respects supplements commentary 1.
DISK 2: The Blade 3 Features are Beyond Good. Just sit down and watch them at one sitting... otherwise how will you know where the  Esperanto is in the film ?? :-)
The Alternate ending in Shanghai cannot be serious, it is well filmed, but just utter rubbish.
Goyer Interviews Goyer is not only a good technical feat, but a good insight to the director versus writer quandry.
Absolutely LOVE the Blooper reel: Kris Kristofferson has the best ad lib line that he steals from CONVOY ( The film) when he says "" 10-4 Good Buddy, Rubber Ducky out"". One of the more classic and retro lines.
The Disc 2 Additions and extras are quite  superb, and almost as long if not longer than the main film.",1150502400,4,7089,4.434514637904468
2246637,4,B0007WFX62,"If you are interested in this set then you already probably like and are familiar with all the movies.

the first one was a surprise hit, really the first big 'Marvel Comics' movie, and it deserved the recognition it got.  a cool take on vampires, Snipes' bad-ass performance, an equally bad-ass villain (Stephen Dorff) and even a great performance by Kris Kristofferson as a gnarly helper for Blade all made this a cool action film with great sfx.

The second one moved into higher gear and featured some updated danger and technology for Blade, as well as new monsters and characters and a tough guy role for Ron 'Hellboy' Perlman, and definitely lived up to reputation of the first of the series.

""Blade: Trinity"" was sadly not such a good finale for the trilogy, because it featured stock performances from Jessica Biel (as the 'tough girl') and Ryan Reynolds (who was better in the Amityville remake) as the smart-ass.  The vampire dogs were a dumb idea and the main bad guy was too generic.

The trilogy has ups and downs,but I think overall is a good choice for action & vampire fans.",1129334400,9,1092,4.661458333333333
2246638,4,B0007WFX62,"These 3 movies were all very enjoyable to me so this collection is a vital one for anyone like me who likes Blade and sci-fi/ horror. The movie has some wicked special effects and awesome action. The movies are all about Blade, a half man, half vampire who can go in the light unlke all other vampires. He hunts down with the help of his mentor all of the vampires.

The movie has a lot of horror moments because of vampires running everyone and getting blown to bits. Blade shoots them, jumps off walls, and does martial arts. He punches them, kicks them and stabs them with his huge sword. While I don't own the set, because I already own them, having bought them when they came out, I do know that it's some great fun. So this is a review of the movies and not the set.

This is how I'd rate them:

Blade: 4 stars- The orignal one that intorduces Blade. Good action and special effects.

Blade II: 5 stars- One of my favorite movies. Absolutely brilliant. Great action, awesome special effects, great movie.

Blade Trinity: 3 and 1/2 stars- A good ending to an awesome trilogy.

But, if you only decide to buy one of them, buy Blade II, it's the best one and if you know that Blade's half human, half vampire and hunts down other vampires, you'll understand it even if you haven't see the first one.",1120348800,,1302,4.359504132231405
2246639,4,B0007WFX62,"Thinking back to when comic book adaptations finally hit the big time, people tend to remember X-MEN as the one that made it happen. What most people probably don't recall is that a couple of years earlier, there was another very successful movie based on one of the lesser-known characters from the MARVEL universe, his name was Blade. Introduced in the tenth issue of Marvel's TOMB OF DRACULA in 1973, Blade was unlike any other superhero around at the time.  Born while his mother was being attacked by a vampire, Blade was endowed with all the vampires' strengths and none of they're weaknesses- including being able to exist in sunlight. With his mother dying during his birth, Blade dedicated his life to exterminating these creatures of the night. Blade was the antithesis of the comic book convention; rather than dressing in a bright, colorful costume and saving lives, he inhabited the night- like his prey and wasted no time killing any creature that stood in his way. He was also an early example of the changing attitudes within the comic industry, whereas nearly all superheroes were depicted as white males, Blade was one of the first heroic black characters to regularly appear in a graphic novel series.

And so, in 1998 the comic became one of the best action-films ever made. Wesley Snipes plays Blade, who is 1/2 human, 1/2 vampire. Blade is able to walk outside at daytime (he is therefore called ""Daywalker), and garlic & silver has no effect on him. He has got the strength of a vampire, but he has also got the thirst for blood from the vampires. To suppress his thirst for blood, Blade uses a special serum. The first thing you'll see in this movie is a woman, who is giving birth to a boy. A vampire has bitten the woman, she dies, but the doctors are able to save her baby, Blade. Soon there is a party in a vampire-nightclub, Blade enters it and begins killing the vampires. The action- and fight-scenes in this movie are incredibly well directed and cool to watch, the soundtrack is cool, and Wesley Snipes is perfect in the role as Blade.

BLADE 2 is superior in just about every way to the original with Guillermo Del Toro (HELLBOY) managing to amplify the horror elements while keeping the action just as intense. Second time around, Blade finds himself in an uneasy truce with his lifelong enemies, helping to track down a new breed of creature on the streets, which feeds on both humans and vampires. BLADE TRINITY finishes the franchise with a satisfying smash. Altogether, a great night in, and some cool DVD extra features.",1119916800,22,2560,4.709821428571429
2246640,5,B0007WFX62,"The Blade Collection is finally here!  For moviegoers, it all began back in the summer of 1998:

BLADE (1998) 1 Disc Rated R (2.35:1) - Talk about a movie experience! From the opening shots, you are literally sucked in (no pun intended) to the world of the vampires. Wesley Snipes completely embraces the role of the title character and plays him to the hilt, with just a bit of dry cocky humor that is very refreshing.  As we first meet Blade at a Vampire techno club (which uses a great remix of a song called ""Confusion"" by New Order) we just know he's a force to be reckoned with as he slices, dices, burns & just plains blows up every vampire he gets a hold of (including Traci Lords, in a very memorable cameo). Kris Kristofferson plays Whistler, Blade's mentor and creator of the various weapons at his disposal, including guns & knives, bombs, & more. (""We have a good arrangement. He makes the weapons, I use 'em""). But it's Stephen Dorff as the bloodthirsty Deacon Frost that helps catapult the film from average action fair to the stuff of comic book legend. With most actors, this would be a one or two dimensional performance, but in the hands of Stephen Dorff, he turns the character of Deacon Frost into something much more multilayared. The interaction he has with Blade as well as his other fellow vampires give off this feel of someone we should not underestimate. Because a truly great villain is a huge key to a movie's success.  The whole mythos of vampires in this film moves the genre in a very interesting direction. According to Blade, pure silver, garlic & sunlight are the main tools to combat vampires. (""Crosses don't do d***, so forget about what you've seen in the movies"") But the fact that the pure blood vampires are personified as old & disposable, while the nonpure vampires are young and virile, looking to take over and run things, can really be looked at as a depiction of our society, with the old guard being kicked out by the new one, lest anarchy ensue.  A Classic.  Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. 120 MIN.

BLADE II (2002) 2 Disc Rated R (1.85:1) - Part 2 begins in Prague, with Blade searching for the location of Whistler, who has been turned into a Vampire and subsuquently tortured. The action sequences are even more elaborate than the first, with the camera actually following jumps and flips in a spiral fashion. By now most of you know the story, which involves a new breed of vampire called Reapors, that are trying to take over their predecessors and eventually enslave the world. The vampires turn to Blade for assistance in helping them wipe out these vicious beasts. In a sort of ""Dirty Dozen"" meets ""Aliens"" tradition, Blade teams up with an elite group of vampires, who, turns out, were originally put together to hunt him down. They instead work together to seek out the Reapors to destroy them, but find that killing them is not as easy as they'd hoped.  The film gives Wesley Snipes more range to show some drama this time, with a subplot involving a female vampire named Nyssa, who's a pure blood, working for her father. Twists and turns abound in this comic book action thriller that gives off a nice feel of energy while at the same time making sense. There's plenty martial arts action to make anybody happy, as well as some much needed dry humor from Snipes and company. All in all a satisfying experience that will leave most moviegoers in an upbeat fashion.  Dolby Digital 5.1 & DTS 6.1 Surround Sound. 117 MIN.

BLADE: TRINITY (2004) 2 Disc Unrated & R rated versions  (2.35:1) - In the final installment, Blade teams up with the Nightstalkers, a ragtag group of vampire hunters lead by the sexy Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) & the quickwitted Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) who are out to track down and kill the vampire of all vampires: Dracula (played by the musclebound Dominic Purcell).  Watch out for Parker Posey, as the scene stealing Danica Talos, the equivalent of a vampire constantly tripping on acid.  Snipes has less to do this time out as Blade, with the newer characters taking up much of his screen time.  But when he's onscreen, he still shines and plays the character perfectly.  A shame that there was turmoil between him and director/screenwriter David S. Goyer (notice, for example, Snipes's unwillingness to contribute to the audio commentaries for the movie even though he had done so for the first two films).  And seeing Dominic Purcell's performance as Drake makes one wish that the Stephen Dorff character of Deacon Frost could somehow be resurrected in order to show these guys how playing a first-rate villian is really done.  Still, with all it's flaws, the film still works, just not as well as most fans would've liked.  The new footage in the unrated version is interesting, as well as the slightly different ending, that many fans may find much more preferable to that of the theatrical version.  Worth having.  Dolby Digital 5.1 & DTS 6.1 Surround Sound. 113 MIN & 122 MIN.

Besides the gripes about the 3rd film, the real disappointment with this wonderful collection is that the original Blade movie is not presented as a 2 disc Platinum Edition with DTS 6.1 Surround Sound the way its sequels are.  It truly deserves the much needed upgrade.  The Box itself is very nice to look at, with a very nicely done 3-D front cover.  For the most part, this is what every Blade fan has been waiting for since that summer of 1998 when one of the best comic book franchises began its journey.  This is definately a collection worth ice skating uphill for!

Blade Trilogy: The Ultimate Collection - Bloodsuckingly Brilliant!

""Blade.  Ready to die?"" - Dominic Purcell as Drake

""Since the day I was born."" - Wesley Snipes as Blade",1116028800,69,5732,4.681274900398407

2246642,1,B0007WFX62,"Let's see...You get all 3 dvds, and ...oh wait...nothing but the dvds. You can buy Blade 1 & 2 most anywhere in the civilized world for less than $10 each. So why are we being expected to shell out $50 for this box set? If you bought them all seperately you'd pay well under the $50 price tag of this boxset.

If you're going to be duped out of your cash, you should at least get something cool for your troubles.",1114473600,13,413,4.098765432098766
2246643,5,B0007WFX62,"In 1998, New Line Cinema collaborated with Marvel Comics to release the first Blade film.  Starring Wesley Snipes in the title role of the half vampire/half human vampire hunter, the film was a surprise success, and made way for Marvel's wave of comic to film adaptations.  Directed by Stephen Norrington (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) and featuring Stephen Dorff as one of the best comic to film villains of all time, the original Blade remains to this day one of the best comic adaptations of all time.  It's first sequel, released in 2002, was directed capably by horror maestro Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy, Cronos), and piled on the gore while diminishing the story.  Despite that, Blade 2 managed to go above and beyond super hero sequels, which made way for 2004's Blade: Trinity.  This time, writer David Goyer (who wrote all three films) took over as director, and the film suffers mightily for it.  For it's many flaws however, it still manages to be an above average actioner, and Ryan Reynolds' comedic delivery of ally Hannibal King gets a lot of laughs.  As a whole, the Blade trilogy is definitely worth owning for fans who don't already own the films, and each DVD is from New Line's Platinum series and contain hordes of special features, including the unrated version of Blade: Trinity.  The only downside is that no bonus content was included at all, and one would figure with all the DVD ""box sets"" and special editions released of late that New Line would have included some new stuff, but then again, with the DVD double dipping of late, maybe that is further down the road.",1114214400,4,1600,4.792727272727273

2246684,3,B0007WFX62,"First I think it's important to say that this is a Deluxe version that is a French Canadian version.  This is NOT shown or labeled well in the product description and when I received the Blu-Ray Collection and it had French on the cover and on the product descriptions, I freaked out a little.

To make it clear, I also think it's important to say that this Deluxe Collection comes w/ BOTH English and French versions on the Blu-Rays, and has BOTH an English and French description on the back.  So as long as you don't mind a little French a long side the English, this Collection is perfectly fine.

The movies have the normal quality you would expect from a Blu-Ray.  There isn't any extra's, which is a shame.  The price is pretty good for 3 together and I couldn't even find Trinity by it's self on Bluray.

So if you want all 3 Blade's on Bluray for a decent price and don't mind that there's no extra's and there's Some French mixed in w/ the Cover.  This isn't a bad way to go.  I would think at some point there would be a better 3 pack available that came with extra's, but this will do for now.",1389744000,,1105,4.248803827751196

I was unable to find the Blade Trilogy (as separate discs) with the exception of the 3rd movie and sometimes the first - but never the second film. Ran across this set while going through my DVD collection to see what I could now replace and came across this box set. Got it for around $40 which is around $13/Blu-ray. Much better pricing than the $16-$20 I've seen for each separately. It's a good transfer (it's a modern film so the original was probably fine to begin with) and definitely looks much better on Blu-ray (as pretty much every film I've purchased to date has).",1359849600,,704,4.595238095238095

It really brought together and really made me dislike the 3rd part. Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Bill were unnecessary and really didn't ads anything but eye candy and smarm to the series. I would have liked to see. Blade and Whistler take on the Vamps in the final installment but leave it to Hollywood to muck up a good thing. Trinity is good but feels out of place with the other two. Delivery was prompt and the sets (picture quality, extras, etc.) were great.  Good purchase.",1338768000,,695,4.47244094488189
2246717,1,B0007WFX62,"See the review 'A Collection Worth Ice Skating Uphill For! Blade Delivers!', May 14, 2005 By Mr. ""alan5973"" in the 5 star reviews of this item. He was correct about aspect ratio and then if you don't know what the flick(s) are about, he detailed that too. Good job 'alan5973'! I bow to others like 'alan5973' here to review what old movies are about. We most have seen them so you either like the flick or you don't. I buy the ones I like because I like them. DUH! The only thing I do care about buying DVDs, my sole priority in making the purchase is to buy the feature in it's OAR (original aspect ratio) that it was filmed in. Any thing else is edited, therefore censored. It has become common place to reproduce movie DVDs in 16X9 to fit modern TVs which are all 16X9 (or 1.78:1) size. This eliminates the dreaded 'black bars' at the top and bottom of the screen when viewing any thing wider than said formats. This means you are misssing both the far left and right sides of the entire feature when they are edited for 16X9 sized modern TVs. Not acceptable! I don't mind the bars, but I do mind some one eleminating part of the flick so it fits better on the screen. I'm insulted as should be the producers, actors and any one else involved in originally making of a movie. So all my reviews of DVDs here only considers if the DVD came in the advertised aspect ratio and I only buy DVDs that are reproduced in the aspect ratio that they are produced and played in at the theaters. This item - The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity) was advertised as being 2.35:1 which happens to be the aspect ratio they were produced in EXCEPT Blade II was produced in 1.85:1 no doubt to save money - shrug?. Again, 5 stars for the movies, zero stars for the makers not going the extra buck to produce the more desirable aspect ratio of 2.35:1, zero stars to Amazon for not listing it correctly in the product information section. I see it has not been corrected at Amazon still. I tried to correct many wrongly advertised aspect ratios here at Amazon including this feature to help other OAR lovers like myself to find what they want, but Amazon doesn't offer the correct aspect ratio choices at their 'Update Product Info' page to do so. I even wrote Amazon several times about the flaw in their aspect ratio correction part. I.e., at the 'Update Product Info' page for this DVD under 'Aspect Ratio:' section among many other choices they have the following choices to entire your correction; 16:9 - 1.75:1, 16:9 - 1.77:1, 16:9 - 1.78:1, 16:9 - 1.85:1, 16:9 - 2.20:1, 16:9 - 2.35:1, 16:9 - 2.40:1, 16:9 - 2.55:1. These are all wrong except for 16:9 - 1.78:1. I don't have my notes, but 16x9 is the same as 1.78:1. That makes all the others impossible. You cannot have 16X9 with any thing except 1.78:1. They are equal. All the other choices here are impossible, but Amazon seems to care naught. Shrug? Amazon doesn't care because I detailed the error of their 'Update Product Info' page 2 or 3 times and they still have not corrected it. It is the same for any DVDs I've tried to correct at 'Update Product Info' page. And when you contact the seller, they don't know either. That means I don't buy from them or I send it back, undesireable choices for any company, don't you think?

2246719,4,B0007WFX62,"This set contains five,count 'em,FIVE discs. The original Blade(Aug/98),one disc,Blade 2(Mar/02),two discs and Blade 3/Trinity(Dec/04),two discs and sporting an extended version AND the original theatrical version. I consider these movies Wesley Snipes shining moments as an actor on the silver screen. Snipes captured the true essence of the comic book character to a tee and brought him to vivid life for three kick-ass pictures.
The original Blade starts out in a vampire run club,of sorts. An unsuspecting male non-vampiric patron is led into this scene by a female vampire. The musics beat is unrelenting and just as it reaches a fever pitch the sprinklers let go with a shower of blood. The fangs all come out and the poor sheep becomes a quick meal for the wolves. In bursts Blade(Snipes)and he mows down most of those there. One vampire burned has to be left behind by Blade as the police show up. It is taken to the morgue where it is examined. It comes back to life but Blade is there to try and stop it. It bites the examiner who Blade rescues and returns to his base of operations. Here we are intro'd to Whistler(Kris Kristofferson),who has been Blades mentor as well as supplying him with all the ""tools"" of the trade needed to kill the vampire population. Meanwhile the council of the Vampires has met and is upset with Frost(Stephen Dorf)whose operation it was who got busted by Blade. Frost is not a pure blood and has been reckless in his pursuits which have brought much unneeded attention on them and have risked a direct war with human kind. Frost goes one better and kills the head of the council and takes over operations. He has been reading up on vampire history and figures out a way to become an invulnerable vampire god. Frost raids Blades hide out and has Whistler bitten. Whistler asks Blade for a weapon to kill himself and Blade walks away,vowing revenge. Arriving at their headquarters Blade is overwhelmed and captured. They drain his blood for their use,create a circle of the vampire council and Frost stands in the middle. Frost is mutated and Blade,having finally escaped,arrives on the scene and its a battle to the death for them both. After the long struggle Frost finally goes down.
A fast moving romp that is enhanced(as all the films are)with fantastic S/Fx. We are introduced to Blade,his tools of ""persuasion"" and his raison d'etre. 4 1/2 stars.
Blade 2 finds Blade in Eastern Europe searching for his old friend Whistler,who it seems did not die that fateful night but instead turned into a vampire. Blades assistant has been a young man called Scud(Norman Reedus)who has been coming up with some nifty high tech gadgetry for him. He tracks down Whistler to a vampire lair where they have been keeping him alive,barely,to torture him. It is not a friendly meeting between Scud and Whistler and the tension is further heightened as the Vampires call Blade to their main house. It seems there is a new type of mutated Vampire on the scene which is hunting and killing them. They ask Blade to assist their specially trained team to help hunt down this new menace. Blade reluctantly agrees while Whistler just doesn't trust them at all. One of the vampire group is the vampire leaders' daughter but the small group is slowly whittled down as the vampire mutants take their toll. There are only two left when the battle ends and a bloody secret is revealed;the vampire elder is the progenitor of the first mutated vampire. It seems he had been experimenting with new strains of blood and his son was the first failure. Well son eventually meets father and father comes out the loser,along with sister. Blade of course can't let ANY vampire loose,especially this new mutation,and he does him in with his usual aplomb. Blade takes the bitten sister,and soon to be mutant,out into the morning sunlight on request to die.
Blade 2 thankfully reunites Snipes and Kristofferson,as they have a great on screen chemistry. The action is as always intense and the S/FX are fantastic. I give it 4 stars.
Blade Trinity has Blade seen as an outlaw by the outside. In fact his base of operations is raided and Whistler becomes a permanent fatality as he blows up everything taking himself in the process. Stunned,Blade is arrested and taken into custody. Meanwhile the Vampires have tracked down and awakened their original progenitor and hope by doing so to improve their race and also to take care of Blade. Sitting in jail Blade is unexpectedly busted out by a couple of unknown vampire hunters. They take him to their compound where it is revealed that one girl is Whistlers own daughter. Blade isn't too sure of the whole thing at first but overtime they seem to gel quite well. One of them,Hannibal played by Ryan Reynolds,is a smart cracking son of a gun who more often than not gets himself into trouble very quickly. The group of youngsters has developed a virus which if injected into the original one will wipe out all the vampires. The group,headed by Blade of course,takes the fight to the vampire lair and in the end it is Blade against Dracula. While they are fighting Whistlers daughter delivers two arrows whose heads are filled with the vampire toxin;one hits and the other Blade himself delivers. It does its job and Dracula dies.
This film is shown in two differing versions/endings. However both films are not up to par with the previous ones as Snipes is obviously given less lines and screen time throughout. In fact this is the topic of a still pending law suit with Snipes against New Line Cinema. Probably to be settled when he is released from prison on 2013!Also there can be a kind of disappointment when a new gen comes in to take over things. As a result of these and other minor drawbacks I give the film 3 1/2 stars.
Technically speaking all three films are in their original widescreen a/r's of 2:35:1 and they look clear and crisp. Extras abound in this five disc set(too many to mention)and are more heavily seen on Blade two and three as they are both two disc sets. All three come in keep cases and sit tight in their respective holders. Blade Trinity comes with a Marvel mini-comic insert as a bonus feature.
All in all a highly recommended set of films as Wesley Snipes is at the top of his game in them. He is seen and heard less in the third film as the new crew are given more visible time,but he's there when it counts and when the vampires need a fresh can of whup-ass.",1311292800,,6441,4.690812720848056

2246730,1,B0007WFX62,"1st:  ""French Version"" (""Francias Vercion"") appears on the Box Set & should tell most experienced blu-ray'ers enough right there.

2nd:  Absolutely NO reason to buy this set (or any of them individually).... Reg. DVD HD-Upscaling will hold you over until a proper U.S. set is released; and here's why...
-- No Bonus Features (not even commentaries)
-- No subtitles (none, any language)
-- Audio = you do have the option of English DTS HD-Master Audio --- but had to have my Hm Theater Sys on near Full Volume on all 3, just to hear much of the dialogue!  (also has English & French Dolby 5.1 -- nothing else)

3rd:  They don't even have a ""Main Menu"" for cryin' out loud.  The movies start automatically, & ReStart automatically.... NO Main OR POP-UP menu (aside from language controls that is)... NO Scene Selection even!!, etc. etc.

4th:  Possibly the WORST sin of this set however... is the Trinity (3rd) film...

-- Not even the same ending!  (Drake goes to morgue, not Blade... Blade just rides off into the sunset on his bike... this ending makes absolutely NO sense, on EVERY level.  The other ending (Blade attacking morgue personnel after awaking 'thirsty')... not only ""paid off"" the Ryan Reynolds 'voice-overs' that are at the beginning & end of the film... but why/how would/could a DEAD ""drake"", ""morph"" into Blade at all... let alone, have it last long enough (while DEAD) before morphing back into ""drake"" on the morgue table!??  MAYBE this was the ""original"" ending shown in theaters (and shown in the RATED versions of Blade Trinity?.... having only ever seen/owned the Unrated DVD version, I don't know...... but if it's NOT released as an UNrated version in the US (when it's finally released)... I FOR ONE WILL NOT BUY IT.

The Die Hard 4 blu-ray & several others... have been a bit of a let down; because they weren't UNrated; but didn't mind so much, because 99% of the time, it's usually just a little less gore/violence/etc. ------ but in 1% cases like these, when the movie itself (or enough of it) is Worse Off ""rated"" than ""unrated"".... well, I'd rather stick with the lower-quality GOOD/Unrated film, than the (somewhat) higher-quality BAD/Rated film, regardless of whether it has bonus features or not.

Buy this if you've nothing better to do with your money... otherwise, wait for the U.S. release & get your money's worth!
(PS: Picture quality was fine... but then again, it's not like the source material was 'grainy' to begin with.  Still, I'd say it could/should be better -- just like the audio... and it will be, as soon as they make a proper U.S. version)

Update:
For those who've commented, or reference in other reviews, that ""I clearly don't have a good surround system""... LOL.  If you only knew.  My surround system is a Yamaha, and is still, to date, one of THE LOUDEST & MOST-CLEAR/PRISTINE Sound available on the market... so when, I, say ""I could barely hear the dialogue, even at full volume""... that's saying quite a lot. __ If you're getting BETTER results out of your blu-ray discs, then there are 2 reasons:
a) You have the audio settings on your PS3 or Blu-Ray player, set to ""level"" the audio so that Dialogue is more easily heard --- this setting, is for the LARGE Masses who do NOT own (expensive) systems like mine, &/or who are listening solely through a T.V.'s ""2.0"" speakers.
b) While insanely unlikely, (see ""A"" above), it's Possible, I got a 'blade set' that wasn't encoded properly, or something along those lines... but don't for a second, fool yourself into thinking my bashing of the audio contained there-in, is a result of my having some cheap-a$$, bargain-basement, Wal-Mart purchased, ""surround system"" setup.  (not that I'm basing on electronics sold at Wal-Mart... but when it comes to Home Theater, they have the bottom rung, for the most part)",1258934400,87,3860,4.828528072837633

2246739,5,B0007WFX62,"Blade  DVD

Blade starring Wesley Snipes is the one that started it all.  Snipes is the protagonist who seeks out and destroys vampires.  The cruel kind, not the semi-pleasant kind found in Charlaine Harris' books.

Blade is probably Snipes most successful role.

Highly recommended for action/adventure fans and for fans of Wesley Snipes.

2246743,5,B0007WFX62,"Sorry for the pun, but the statement is true.

I had never heard of the Blade comics, so when the first movie came out I went in expecting an action-packed thriller.

But, alas, what I found was a new obsession. Immediatly after watching the first movie, which does a good job of bringing the comic characters to life (even if a bit glamorized), I must say that I did not thoroughly read the comics, but rather get a nice feel for the darkness and anti-hero aspects of the Blade character.

But, back to the movies. Here's what I think:

Blade--Great intro film; special F/X are top-notch, stylistic, and fight scenes are choreographed to precision; story fun, but a bit choppy; overall 5/5

Blade 2--Rehash of first story was a bit annoying (watch the first one to know what I mean); F/X bigger/better; fight scenes aided with special effects, but still stylistic with the choreography; overall 4/5 (mostly because vampire gang annoyed me)

Blade Trinity--Great action film all around; introduction of two characters fits well into the franchise (and they both do a good job along side Wesley); more fight scenes, done again with presicion and excellence; much more F/X (good or bad thing); DVD extras are fun too; overall 5/5

In essence, if you are looking for a good 6 hours of exciting action scenes, expertly choreographed fight sequences, and vampires, well this is the triology for you!",1174262400,,1394,4.831932773109243
