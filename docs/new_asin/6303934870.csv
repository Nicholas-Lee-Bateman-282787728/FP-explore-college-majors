735572,3,6303934870,"Having watched---and been quite enamored with Margaret Lockwood in ""The Lady Vanishes"" (3/4 of which takes place over rails), and having been impressed by that film's plot, dialogue, and direction I decided to board ""The Night Train to Munich"" so to speak, so as to continue the journey.  Contrary to others herein, I cannot say that such was a wise decision on my part: First of all the quality of this film's recording is rather poor which doesn't help matters.  Margaret Lockwood's role pales in comparison herein too; as this film is really one without a leading lady's role, notwithstanding Ms. Lockwood's talents.  She was wonderful in Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes,"" but here has just not been given enough material to work with.  (It's interesting to think that while ""The Lady Vanishes"" title is not at all suggestive of being set aboard a train, ""The Night Train to Munich"" declaratively promotes this notion---notwithstanding the fact that little more than a fifth of it takes place aboard any moving conveyance!)  Yes, Rex Harrison ably carries his own herein, as do Basil Radford & Nauton Wayne (reprising their Charters & Caldicott---captivated by cricket---characters), but such is not enough to carry this film into the station.  Director Carol Reed (of ""The Third Man"" fame) just wasn't given a screenplay commensurate with the quality that those who wrote ""The Lady Vanishes"" provide for this film.  If you are particularly devoted fans of Radford & Wayne,  Harrison, and/or Lockwood you may be interested in seeing this film, but otherwise you'd be better off just watching ""The Lady Vanishes"" again---or ""Strangers on a Train"" if you want suspense along rails.  There are hundreds of average to above-average films out there, so unless you've seen most of the the great ones already---and have seen the best foreign films too, you ought to take at pass at fare such as ""The Night Train to Munich."" Cheers!",1109635200,3,1926,5.031446540880503
735573,4,6303934870,"An enjoyable, antiquated spy thriller from the early days of World War Two.  England was already at war with Germany when this came out 1940, although the action is set on the very day that England and France declared war, following the German invasion of Poland, in 1939.  Carol Reed directs and  Rex Harrison stars as a devil-may-care English agent who slips into Germany to rescue a Czech scientist and his attractive daughter from a jackbooted, ruthless  Gestapo agent, played by Paul Henreid (of course!).  The film mixes offbeat comedy with suspense, buoying British spirits by poking fun at German officiousness and rigidity.  One notable feature of this film is the second appearance of the team of Basil Radford and Naughton Wayne as the plucky, train-riding upper-class twits, Charters & Caldicott -- the same roles they played in Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes.""  The Charters & Caldicott duo appeared in several films, all with different directors, as sort of a cherished English cinema in-joke... They definitely add to the fun here!",1101600000,3,1053,5.12280701754386
735574,4,6303934870,"Night Train to Munich is a hopelessly outdated yet watchable British 1940 flick made at the precipice of the commencement of World War 2.  Rex Harrison plays a somewhat miscast British agent posing as a German major in an attempt to rescue Margaret Lockwood and her father a Czech industrialist from the clutches of the Nazis.  The father played by James Harcourt is the inventor of a revolutionary form of armor plating that the Nazis are desperate to procure.  Paul Henreid of Casablanca fame gives a notable performance as a treacherous Gestapo captain scheming to coerce the military secrets from the inventor.
The film possesses that hokey quality of those of that era, however Carol Reed was a talented director and tells the story well with a minimum of wartime propaganda.",1036800000,10,780,4.938931297709924
735575,5,6303934870,"First, the bad news. I have seen two VHS versions of this superb film circulating, but both are of exceedingly low quality. I could be wrong, but I believe that at the moment there is not a first rate version of this film available in any format. We stand in great need of a fully restored DVD version of this film. The available VHS version looks scratched and poorly focused. It is still enjoyable, but one has the illusion of watching a bad print in the wee hours of the morning.
On one level, this film is a sort of remake of Hitchcock's THE LADY VANISHES. The parallels to the latter are especially strong, and not at all accidental. The screenplays for both THE LADY VANISHES and NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH were written by Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder. Furthermore, Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford recreated their delightful characters Charters and Caldicott, two British twits who nearly stole the show in THE LADY VANISHES. Although they don't make quite the impact in this film that they did in THE LADY VANISHES, their presence nonetheless adds considerably to the film. The female protagonist is portrayed by Margaret Lockwood, who was also in the Hitchcock film. New to the Carol Reed film are an utterly delightful (as usual) Rex Harrison and Paul Henreid. Like THE LADY VANISHES, much of the film takes place on the European continent on a train, and the male hero in each film has a career that involves to some degree music.
NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH is not, however, as good as THE LADY VANISHES. The difference isn't in the cast and the script but in the directors. In a suspense film of this kind, Hitchcock would shame any competitor, and both his touch with suspense and with comedy (elements dominant in both films) exceeds that of the otherwise quite gifted Carol Reed. If the two films did not resemble each other so sharply, one would not feel compelled to compare the two.
Nonetheless, taken on its own terms, NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH is a first rate film, and anyone watching it will have a thoroughly good time. While Hitchcock makes THE LADY VANISHES a better film, Rex Harrison brings a degree of charm and elegance that is unique. This film, in fact, affords Harrison with one of the better roles of his career. All in all, it is hard to imagine someone not having a great time watching this movie. This will be ever truer when someone provides a good, fresh, restored copy of the film on DVD.",1034640000,29,2416,4.607888631090487

735774,3,6303934870,"Obviously, there is a common theme in many wartime pictures: survival. Films based in the European theater usually contain a strain of desperation, anger, and fear against a relentless Nazi war machine. These negative strains are often juxtaposed with veins of hope, ingenuity, and determination. As a result a common outcome emerges whereas most Nazis portrayed in films like A Night Train to Munich or even The Lady Vanishes (1938, Alfred Hitchcock) are machine-like or robotic in their determination to control and defeat the Allies. Yet they lack the cleverness or wit to successfully grasp the end goal of domination. This creates an all to common wartime film formula, such as the cartoonish Nazi villains portrayed in A Night Train to Munich, they're dumb and easily outsmarted by the British. Part propaganda, part marketing; the charming Rex Harrison and lovely Margret Lockwood (portraying a wealthy Czech) clash with the Nazi stooges led by Paul Henried (of Casablanca fame). A Night Train to Munich doesn't help the formula much, where casting is concerned t is hit-and-miss: Henried is single-mindedly wooden, Harrison annoyingly aloof, and only Lockwood brings beauty, brains, and pluck to an impossibly difficult situation (a.k.a. the plot). A spy film at its heart, director Carol Reed tried too hard to mimic his rival Alfred Hitchcock in themes and content; only later will Reed perfect his spy craft film making in the 1940s with his masterpiece The Third Man (1949). Also, its very hard to buy Harrison in the part he plays (youll see). A slightly silly, but solid film produced at a critical period in history  World War II - a fact that cannot be overlooked as it adds the only real depth to the storyline. Additionally, the final ""chase sequence"" is uniquely set in the Alps and rivals the best Hitchcock films for suspense. Recommended for fans of Rex Harrison, Carol Reed, and British cinema.",1423699200,,1917,5.047318611987381
735775,4,6303934870,"PLOT: Czech scientist and his daughter try and escape Nazi Germany.

The Nazis invade Czechoslovakia and a scientist escapes to England.

She ends at the shore where a SINGER who cannot sing...LOL...REX HARRISON is helping hide her father. But the Nazis kidnap both father and daughter and take them back to Germany on a submarine. HARRISON goes to Germany and becomes a Nazi Army Officer using his cover to help them escape. The ""NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH"" is the place where the escape attempt will start.  Two British men who are pacifists get drug into help the escape. The plot is a bit thin but lots of British Humor here. From the LOUSY singing of Harrison to the Mein Kampe book used as a very good prop. This was set just before the outbreak of World War 2.

735832,4,6303934870,"""Night Train to Munich"" is a spy movie, mixed in with some comedic undertones at the beginning of the Second World War. It's very suspenseful, about a British agent who tries to get a scientist and his daughter out of Germany and into Switzerland, before the Nazis can capture them.

Rex Harrison plays the lead, the hero. He's fantastic, and he gives one of the best performances of his career. Paul Henreid plays the villain, and it's great casting because he's a fantastic actor. Ironically, Henreid would go on to play an anti-Nazi activist in Casablanca a few years later. So it's fun to see Henreid take on a different kind of role.

The best part of the film is the thrilling climax, it's a shoot-out that occurs over the Swiss Alps. The movie's ending is really fantastic and the film is worth-watching for fans of suspense cinema or World War Two films.

I think it must have been very difficult to make this movie, a pro-Allies war story, during the first few years of the Second World War. It's very timely.",1380844800,,1018,4.582417582417582

Not that it's a difficult movie to swallow -- Carol Reed's direction is excellent, the photography marvelous and the writing is clever in more than one place. And if the plot tends to be a bit facile now and then, well, I'm willing to overlook it. Rex Harrison is brilliant as a British agent, and it's nice to see Paul Henreid as someone other than Victor Laszlo. The film also features the characters of Charters and Caldicott from The Lady Vanishes, supporting roles that appear in other movies as well. As I tried to suggest earlier, I think the film's main flaw is that, despite some clever elements, the basic story line lacks texture, complexity and surprise after the first fifteen minutes. And, as noted by at least one other reviewer, this particular release offers nothing in the way of special features or commentary, which is a shame.

Maybe it was just to keep the home front spirits up but watching this one seventy years later knowing what we know about what happened on all fronts and by most of the parties was a little disconcerting.

Here's why. The deal had been done in Munich (a place name that stands for sell-out in world politics, rightly or wrongly compared, even today) whereby Czechoslovakia was forthwith handed over to Hitler in order, well, in order to bring ""peace in our times."" This little action culminated the veer to war, big time war, after the earlier annexation of Austria and the forming of a German protectorate in Sudetenland section of Czechoslovakia and merely whetted Hitler's appetite. Serious stuff though, very serious especially for political opponents of the Nazis and those who had some special skills that the Third Reich could make use of in some way, particularly for military purposes. Of course the other players in the war build-up drama, including Great Britain, had that same interest.  And that conflicting premise forms the thriller core of this film.

Enter one Czech scientist who is able to escape to London before the Nazis grab him and his clever fetching daughter who wound up left behind, left behind in a concentration camp when the German Army marched into Prague. The Germans were, however, ready to move might and main in order to get the scientist's services so they sent a loyal Nazi-enflamed officer (played by Paul Henreid last seen in these quarters leading the European resistance, and caught up in a Rick's Cafe love triangle in Morocco, in the film Casablanca.  Go figure.) into the camp to track him down by having him plot an escape for him and the daughter in order to win the daughter's confidence. He does track the scientist down and brings him and the daughter back to Germany. That in turn triggers British efforts led by an undercover naval officer (played, played archly, very archly by Rex Harrison) who infiltrated the German high command in order to get one important scientist back to the Allied side.
Of course all of this is going on while Germany, in the meantime, has invaded British ally Poland which in the real world might have complicated things a bit. A very big bit. Not to worry though  Rex's plan, and some personal heroics to impress that fetching daughter, to get father and daughter away to neutral Switzerland  via various subterfuges (including enlisting a pair of  British travelers, arch, very arch, British travelers) in the end gets them away from the grasping clutches of  the arch-villain Henreid. So you can see why this one is, well, like I said is disconcerting. This is not director Carol Reed's best thriller effort, not by a long shot, the classic 1949 thriller The Third Man starring Orson Welles is.",1353888000,,3090,4.782363977485929
735921,4,6303934870,"This 1940 lighthearted comedy-thriller pokes fun at the Third Reich during the time of the Phony War (before France fell and British cities were being bombed in WWII) and thus before the heights of horror that Nazism would rack up. It was well received by critics and audiences back in the day and some said it fell into the top ten movies of its year.

Some have noted that it isn't as viewable today and estimated that it was because the uninformed saw it as a cheap imitation of Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes"" which had the same writers and a few of the actors, including Margaret Lockwood who was THE FEMALE ACTRESS of her time in Britain.

Atwood plays the daughter of a great scientist who escape to the United Kingdom but a variety of circumstances find them heading back to Germany against their will. Enter the character of Rex Harrison (the Dickie character) who plays an undercover British agent, posing as a Nazi officer attempting to rescue them before they reach Munich. What follows is a story that goes from your traditional tense, thriller to lighthearted moments of comedy.

Charters and Caldicott (played by Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne), the bumbling yet lovable British bachelors traveling to golf around the world make a second appearance in film and actually assist the ""good guys"" in fighting the Nazis at the end of this tale. Another notable actor was Paul Henreid, who I cannot detail without a spoiler (see SPOILERS below).

While everyone does a commendable job the peacock personality of Rex Harrison should not be missed. Personally, I really enjoyed seeing Charters and Caldicott show up, too. Their pseudo cluelessness adds to the lightheartedness of the film.

Interesting take on life in England. Life goes on as they show the English lower class at the docks when she and the Henreid arrive. It focuses especially on a relaxed middle class English background who are quite calm about these pressing state matters. There rarely seems to be an Englishman around in uniform whereas Germany's areas are like an occupied regime and it seems almost everyone is in some type of uniform. Even the British higher ups are calmly talking about different types of jams that their wives are making before they let the Rex Harrison character try to save the daughter and her father scientist.

General themes of what is a gentleman? Stronger theme of getting involved in the war to stop the Nazis. Note the ""light"" approach to a Nazi concentration camp early on in the picture.

Directed by Carol Reed, with its adapted screenplay by Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder loosely drawing on the Gordon Wellesley novel Report on a Fugitive. (Wiki)

TRIVIA: the working title for this film was ""Gestapo"" but once Britain got into the war they were also able to change the title and change it from an imaginary country (similar to ""The Lady Vanishes"") to Germany.

Some say that Director Carol Reed was still irritated that Rex had stolen his girlfriend back in their days as actors and thus poked indirect fun at the character of Rex. Watch for the dialogue play between him and Atwood as well as the end result of the love story.

The second of four cinematic appearances by Charters and Caldicott (played by Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne). They first appeared in The Lady Vanishes, also written by Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder. They later appeared in Crook's Tour, and in Millions Like Us, which was also written by Gilliat and Lauder.

Comedy-thriller made during the Phony War which was before France fell and the Luftwaffe bombed British cities. Hitler and his people were thus seen as figures to be mocked and note that this was before enough people knew about the horrors of Nazism.

Lame stuff with the guns at the end. Rex Harrison's character must have fired 15 or more shots before he had to reload. Henreid's character would shoot with a weird hunch over of his neck. That isn't how you fire a pistol.

Interesting love story ending. They hug briefly, he shakes hands with her father and then it ends suddenly. Reed getting back at Harrison or was Harrison's new lover super jealous of Atwood? Inquiring minds wanna know.

Dickey is so self absorbed he can't be a life partner for anyone seems to be the indication. Atwood's character even comments on it and you get the feeling they won't be quite romantic.

There was some irony that Paul Henreid, an advocate against the Nazis before it was fashionable, ends up playing their undercover spy and then is revealed to be SS.",1353456000,,4732,4.841387856257745

It really didn't start to take off until the appearance of its real star, Rex Harrison as Dickie Randall/Gus Bennett (agent extraordinaire).  Even though the movie begins with Margaret Lockwood and Paul Henreid and they have the most screen time, their characters didn't enlist much of an impression, they were rather nondescript, anyone could have played their roles.  Rex Harrison, on the other hand, commanded attention.  It probably also helped that he had most of the best lines in this film and knew exactly what to do with them.
The story is fraught with suspense, intrigue, humor, and just a little romance (Lockwood didn't seem to know what to do with Harrison, she wilted while he overpowered).  A better casting choice might have helped.  All the same, that's a minor point in the story.  Things grew especially tense when all the characters were confined to a train heading for Munich.  Even the considerable humor of Charters and Caldicott couldn't detract from the danger inherent with being trapped with the enemy.  The multiple escapes throughout were nicely timed (although there was that odd bit when they were given a tremendous head start that must have been a hour worth or more and still the bad guys managed to catch up).  I too, loved the gun with an almost never ending supply of bullets.  It came in handy.
Topped off with a great ending, who could ask for more?",1309737600,,1681,4.7353951890034365
735967,5,6303934870,"Very few films dealt with the subject of concentration camps, but this was one of the first. ""All Through the Night"" (1941) has a mere reference to it, and a few years later ""Seventh Cross"" (1944) gives us a peek inside a camp circa 1936, but otherwise the subject was rarely covered in films. But here in 1940 we have one of the first glimpses as Margaret Lockwood, playing the daughter of a scientist (James Harcourt), is arrested, imprisoned, and eventually escapes with the help of a German undercover agent (Paul Henreid).

Bear in mind, life in a concentration camp is not at all depicted as it really was, but there was no way, in 1940, for the film makers to know what was going on. The worse thing happening on screen is a solid beating and off screen they talk about getting lashed. It's not very pleasant, but hardly approaches what we now know to be true.

Coming as it does in 1940, this British production appeared while England was at war and while the U.S. was still neutral.

Margaret Lockwood (1916-90) is best remembered from her roles in ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938) and ""The Wicked Lady"" (1945). She made more than 40 films between 1934 and 1976 and was nominated for a BAFTA for ""Cast a Dark Shadow"" (1955). Top billed Lockwood and director Reed made 6 films together - this was their 5th.

Paul Henreid (1905-92) will forever be the besieged Victor Laszlo from ""Casablanca"" (1942) or Jerry Durrance lighting two cigarettes at once from ""Now Voyager"" (1942), despite his more than 40 other films. Henried, was a victim of the communist scare and was blacklisted as an actor, turning his attentions to directing and work on stage.

For an ardent anti-Nazi, Henreid gives a remarkably sympathetic portrayal, and indeed, the Nazis are more often treated as comical devices with very few of the types of evil and sadistic characters that later films would offer. The reason, of course, is that the film was developed in 1939 and the full extent of the Nazi evil was not known, and not quite beyond anyone's imagination.

Rex Harrison (1908-90) made 50 films and won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for ""My Fair Lady"" (1964) and was nominated for Golden Globes for ""Cleopatra"" (1963), ""The Agony and the Ecstasy"" (1965), and ""Dr. Doolittle"" (1967). ""Sexy Rexy"" is the scene stealer in this film, completely delightful as a vaudeville performer, a German officer, and a love smitten puppy. It's a real treat to see him so early in his career.

FWIW - Harrison and Reed were old friends, and earlier in their careers when they were both young actors, Harrison reportedly stole Reed's girlfriend.

This was Harrison's first shot at a major role, and he does it in a grand fashion. The role was originally intended for top star Michael Redgrave, but he was working with John Gielgud so Harrison got the break, and the rest is history.

The characters played by Henreid and Harrison were a favorite subject of director Carol Reed who liked to feature people with dual identities - think Alec Guiness in ""Our Man in Havana"" (1959) or Orson Welles in ""The Third Man"" (1949)..

The film features the two cricket fanatics Basil Radford (1897-1952) and Naunton Wayne (1901-70) who were a big hit in ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938) which, like this film, has a major scene on a train. That film was written by Sid Gilliat and Frank Launder who also wrote this film. The team of Gilliat and Launder made more than 40 films together, mostly comedies, and were responsible for the St. Trinian's series of films (1954 - 1966).

Director Carol Reed (1906-76) was nominated 3 times for an Oscar and won for ""Oliver"" (1968) and won Palme d'Or for ""The Third Man"" (1949). He made 33 films between 1935 and 1972. He admitted that this film was a conscious attempt to copy Hitchcock's style in ""The Lady Vanishes"". FWIW I don't see the ""Hitchcock"" style in Reed's direction, nor is his style in this film necessarily a good predictor of the great work he would do later. I think the direction is really good and can be considered on its own merits.

Interestingly enough Hitch had moved to Hollywood where he was working on ""Rebecca"", and many people think he would have been the choice as director had he stayed in England.

The top grossing films in 1940 were ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Rebecca"", ""Boom Town"", and ""Santa Fe Trail"". ""Rebecca"" won for best picture, James Stewart (""Philadelphia Story"" was best actor, and Ginger Rogers (""Kitty Foyle"") was best actress. Other notable films that year were westerns like Spencer Tracy in ""Northwest Passage"", Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan in ""The Westerner"", and Errol Flynn in ""Virginia City"", comedies like Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in ""My Favorite Wife"", Cary Grant and Roz Russell in ""His Girl Friday"", and W.C. Fields as ""The Bank Dick"" and with Mae West in ""My Little Chickadee"".

Interestingly enough war films were not so popular in 1940 - Joel McCrea in ""Foreign Correspondent"", Charlie Chaplin in ""The Great Dictator"", and James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan in ""The Mortal Storm"" were among the only war films released that year. In contrast, 1941 would be a banner year for war films (e.g., ""Sergeant York"", ""Buck Privates"", ""In the Navy"", ""The Sea Wolf""  ""A Yank in the RAF"", ""Dive Bomber"", ""49th Parallel"").

The NY Times' Theodore Strauss called the film ""the year's most perilous ride"" and said it was ""wittily written and spare as a coded message."" The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Writing. It did well at the box office in the UK and in the US.

If the film has any fault at all it is the cheap model work which was characteristic of British films including Hitchcock's. Coming as this does in 1940 it is a little startling, as this was more prevalent in the early to mid 30s rather than 1940. But this is a minor point and most of the scenes are interior scenes anyway.

This is a nice little spy thriller with some propaganda thrown in at a critical time when the world has just gone to war. All the requisite film elements (acting, directing, photography, music) are present in spades.

PS - You don't need to see ""The Lady Vanishes"" before you see this film, but you will probably enjoy it better if you do.

PPS - Amazon uses a 5 point scale. If they used a 10 point scale I'd give this one a 9 rather than a 10, but forced to use only 5 points, it gets a 5 rather than a 4. It's clearly better than good. but not great as a 5 would imply.",1306972800,,6410,4.6308370044052865

  The best part of 'Night Train to Munich' is the inciting incident which leads to the Act 2 machinations involving Rex Harrison's Dickie Randall, the naval officer masquerading as music hall entertainer, Gus Bennett. Czech scientist and armor-plating expert, Axel Bomasch. is whisked away to England, right before the Nazis march in, but his daughter Anna (Margaret Lockwood) is left behind and ends up in a concentration camp. She befriends Paul Marsen, who at first appears to be a Czech political prisoner (played by Paul Henreid, famous for his Viktor Laszlo role in 'Casablanca'). Nave Anna doesn't realize that the escape from the concentration cap is manufactured and that Marsen is actually a member of the Gestapo.

  Somehow, Randall and his fellow intelligence operatives, can't seem to figure out that the Germans have already deduced the location of Bomasch or the fact that Marsen is a double agent. Instead of killing Bomasch, the Germans merely knock him out and whisk Axel and Anna back to Germany in a U-boat. Wouldn't you know it but Randall's superiors have no objections to allowing him to go to Germany and try and save the kidnapped Czechs. Since he's spent three years in Germany, he supposedly can speak the language and pretend that he's a high level Army Engineer. Incredibly, he easily gains access to Anna and her father after producing forged paperwork which is not closely examined by the bumbling Germans. Randall pretends that he formerly was involved with Anna and convinces the Germans (including the skeptical Gestapo double agent) that he might be able to convince Anna to help change her father's mind about the Nazis. A wrench is thrown into Randall's plan to spirit Anna and her father out of Germany when he learns that the Nazis have gotten orders from headquarters to immediately bring the Czechs to Munich.

  While on the train, we're introduced to the same self-involved Englishmen, Charters and Caldicott, who also appeared as the same characters in Hitchcock's 'The Lady Vanishes'. Charters blows Randall's cover when he asks Randall if he's the same person who he knew as an undergraduate at Oxford. According to one sagacious internet poster, Charters and Caldicott are not dolts but rather represent those Englishmen who chose to remain ignorant about the goings-on in Europe prior to the outbreak of the war. That's why the most important thing to Caldicott about ""Mein Kampf"" is that it's used as a marital aid by German women. It's only after a German soldier orders Charters and Calidcott to grovel before them, that they become galvanized and decide to 'join the cause' and help Randall.

  I'm unable to speak very highly about the climax of 'Night Train to Munich'. How is Randall able to subdue Henreid's Gestapo man without making any noise inside the train cabin? And how do Charters and Caldicott subdue two German soldiers and bring them back to the same cabin without being noticed? How do they so easily remove the solders' uniforms and put them on, also without making any noise? And what about the long car ride from Munich to Switzerland? Did you ever hear the word, 'roadblock'? During the shootout from the cable car, Rex Harrison seems to fire about 30 bullets when it appears he's carrying a gun that probably can fire only six cartridges. Finally, our Gestapo guy doesn't seem that badly wounded which would prevent him from dragging himself up to the cable controls and stopping the cable car from reaching the other side.

  You can catch 'Night Train' in a newly restored version from the Criterion Collection. The only extra is commentary from so-called film scholars Peter Evans and Bruce Babington. Unfortunately, Evans and Babington fail to make even one critical point regarding this film as they regard it as some kind of masterpiece. Given its slew of implausibilities, a masterpiece it is not.

  The film was very highly regarded in the US when it was released here in 1940. For its time, it was a highly effective piece of propaganda which helped convince Americans that Britain's war against Germany was just. The English, with their laid back ""business as usual"" attitude is nicely contrasted with the unscrupulous and menacing behavior of both the German Army/security apparatus and bureaucracy. A great deal of credit must be given to Paul Henreid as the sinister Gestapo agent. Unlike some of the other German/Nazi characters in the film, he's actually quite scary (as he should be). From a modern sensibility, Rex Harrison's casual acting demeanor coupled with the absolute ease in which his character outwits his opponents, relegates 'Night Train to Munich' to the realm of the 'B' picture. But as a piece of World War II history, 'Night Train' is well worth viewing at least once.",1281571200,6,4817,4.970149253731344

735974,5,6303934870,"Had Alfred Hitchcock still been making films in Britain in 1940, this would have been the second version of his 1938 The Lady Vanishes.

Had that been the case, then, we would have had essentially two versions of the same movie with the same writing team and the same director.

However, such was not the case, so in this movie we nonetheless get to see an improved version of The Lady Vanishes.

Like The Lady Vanishes, the story revolves around a maiden in distress aided by a dashing Brit (here played by a very young and bouyant Rex Harrison) where the critical action...well...takes place on a train.

In 1938, in the shadow of impending war, Hitchcock was barred by studio politics from directing naming his enemy: the Nazis.  But here, we prominently see guys in Nazi uniforms doing bad stuff to our damsel in distress (played by Margaret Lockwood).

A CAUTIONARY NOTE:  For those unfamiliar with this film, it contains many scenes where see Paul Henreid (yes! Victor Laslow from Casablanca himself) dressed in a Nazi uniform.  For even those slightly familiar with Casablanca I would wager the sight will be a disjuntive one in much the same way seeing Nosferatu's Max Schreck in a comedic role in Murneau's Duke's Finances is disjunctive.

In other words, being so used to considering that particular actor in one special role, it momentarily deflates your suspension of disbelief to see him in so different a role.

AND ANOTHER CAUTIONARY NOTE:  Because this movie was made in 1940, its depiction of German concentration camp life is grossly at odds with what later newsreel footage so sadly showed us.  The inmates -- contrary to history -- seem well dressed and well fed.  In fact, Lockwood even teases Harrison by telling him that his singing is much worse than anything she experienced in the German camps.  Would that such had actually been historically true.

But movies, I guess, are ultimately about the times in which they were made.  Though history no doubt outdated some of the story elements of this movie, the movie still tells us volumes about what people perceived to be the situation at that critical juncture.  (On a side note, I imagined the likes of Charles Lindbergh -- who fought for appeasement with Germany -- favorably watching this movie and approving its tone even into the 40s.)

BUT THESE THINGS BEING SAID:  This movie nonetheless remains a major achievement in that it was still an anti German movie at such an early point in the conflict.

From my perspective the main thing that elevates this movie over its 1938 version is a predictably stellar performance by Harrison who really sells the whole cavalier hero thing essentially make him a sort of proto James Bond.

And for his part, Henried does make ultimately make just as good of villain here as he had been a hero in Casablanca.  While Rick and Elsa may always have Paris, this movie shows us that Henreid will always have this part and his Laslow to show some of the range he so undeniably had.

736103,4,6303934870,"I was looking forward to this new Criterion edition of Carol Reed's ""remake"" of Hitchcock's THE LADY VANISHES with enormous anticipation.  I had long loved the film from having seen it in student film clubs while in grad school in New Haven and Chicago, but had been repulsed by the public domain editions that were the only way to acquire the film on either VHS or DVD.  But with Criterion you always look forward not merely to a sterling restoration, but the bundle of wonderful special features that come with the film.  A superb recent example is the recent Criterion edition of John Ford's STAGECOACH, which was filled to overflowing with commentaries and special features.  But when I opened this, I was severely disappointed to see only a single special feature, two writers who discuss various aspects of the film.  No commentary however, and no other additional features.  The Criterion edition of THE LADY VANISHES, on the other hand, not only has a commentary and special video features, it also contains an entire film featuring Caldecott and Charters, the characters invented by writers Sidney Gilliatt and Frank Launder in THE LADY VANISHES.  Needless to say, this edition of NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH, with its lack of features, was quite a disappointment.

Still, as I pointed out above, there were no good versions of this available on tape or disc, and this does feature a beautifully restored print.  In truth, if it weren't for the fact that Criterion had set such ridiculously high standards with previous releases, there would be no complaints with this one.

The film is such an explicit imitation of THE LADY VANISHES that charges of plagiarism might be leveled, if it wasn't that it was so clearly respectful of what Hitchcock had achieved in that masterpiece.  This film isn't quite as elegant or as brilliant as Hitchcock's film (in fact, a scene by scene comparison will reveal the difference between the exceptionally talented Reed and the genius Hitchcock), but it still is one of the most enduring films made during World War II.  It features the same blend of intrigue and humor that Hitchcock's film contained.  Gilliatt and Launder wrote the screenplay for both films.  Both films starred Margaret Lockwood as well as Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne as Charters and Caldicot.  Let me repeat the latter:  it was not merely a case of the same actors appearing in both films, but they played precisely the same characters.  This has close to no precedent in the history of film, one set of fictional characters shifting from one film to another.  They did, of course, go on to appear in other movies together (one of which can be found in the Criterion edition of THE LADY VANISHES).  And there are equivalent characters in both films, as well as a MacGuffin in each (the MacGuffin in NIGHT TRAIN being the scientific work of a Czech professor whose work will, when complete ""revolutionize warfare"" -- nevermind that the work is not explored in even generalities).

One way the Hitchcock film is superior is in the illusion of their being on a train.  In THE LADY VANISHES Hitchcock worked complete magic in making the set simulate a moving train.  He blended sound, light, and a staggering number of individual tricks to make the illusion come alive.  In NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH the train set is, in comparison, comparatively static.  Anyone doubting me can watch any two minutes of each film in the train scenes and note the difference.  Apart from that, however, there is a fascinating similarity in the tricks used in each film, with each film blending models, miniatures, matte paintings, and studio sets.  Although the Hitchcock film is clearly the better of the two, what is remarkable is just how good this ""rip off"" is.  Few films meant to emulate a previous film have succeeded so completely as this one.

So while this lacks the special features that one would have liked, it nonetheless gives fans of the film at long last a superb print to watch at home.",1278633600,35,3992,4.830882352941177
736104,5,6303934870,"It's a damn shame that NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH seems fated to forever languish in the shadow of its predecessor THE LADY VANISHES. I love these two movies, and admit readily to a likeness between the two. Both are enthralling wartime espionage thrillers which spend crucial passages of time on a train hurtling thru enemy territory. Both star my early crush Margaret Lockwood. Both feature the same scriptwriting team, and both feature those ever inconvenienced, cricket-obsessed side characters, Charters and Caldicott. These two films are cinematic gems, and I will give THE LADY VANISHES the nod because it did come first and because Hitchcock helmed it. But I also harbor mad love for NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH.

Those who've only ever seen Rex Harrison as Dr. Dolittle or Henry Higgins are in for a startlement because this mannered gent surprisingly makes for a dashing and resourceful secret agent. Although it doesn't seem that way when he's first introduced to us. We first meet his character - with the very unspylike name of Gus Bennett - as he awfully warbles sappy songs by the pier. But, of course, that's only a cover. Bennett turns out to be the British contact and guardian of a Czech scientist, and shame on Bennett for getting coshed and allowing the scientist and the scientist's lovely daughter to be captured by Nazis on English soil. Turnabout being fair play, now Bennett must sneak into Germany on his own extraction mission.

Germans impersonating Englishmen. Englishmen impersonating Germans. It's a tangled plot that then little known director Carol Reed weaves, but he's got the chops and he directs the film surely and tautly. It's a story that takes place predominantly on the night of September 3, 1939, when England declared war on Germany. The globe-trotting intrigue shifts from Prague to England to Berlin to the Swiss Alps. The screenplay crackles with tension and yet finds space to interject some biting and rather eyebrow-raising (for its time) romantic interludes, as well as generous heaps of levity.

There's always been something a bit off-putting about Rex Harrison, and the Hollywood rumor has it that the man has always been this vain, impudent character. In this instance, his air of superiority services his two roles, initially as British secret service chap Gus Bennett but, more tellingly, later on as the monocled Major Ulrich Herzoff of the German Corps of Engineers. Carol Reed keeps things nerve-jangling during ""Major Herzoff's"" infiltration of the German high command, his arsenal consisting of nothing more than a fabricated letter of introduction, his quick thinking, and sheer guts. Still, it's a lot of fun when Margaret Lockwood, in the German hotel scene, punctures Harrison's bubble. It's also a nod to the film's often sparkling dialogue:

- Anna Bomasch (Lockwood): ""Y'know, if a woman ever loved you like you loved yourself, it would be one of the romances of history.""

- Gus Bennett: ""Yes, I'm unlikely to think of an adequate reply to that. I think we ought to drink a toast. England expects that every secret service man this night should do his duty."" Then, as Bennett pops open a bottle of champagne: ""Flat.""

I don't think you give a what that the film is based on the novel REPORT ON A FUGITIVE by some guy named Gordon Wellesley or that the Czech scientist is crucial to the war effort because of his formula for armor plating. Those things don't matter. NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH is pure escapism, so the advice is to just sit back and take it all in, not only the best parts of the film but also the rather shabby miniature work, and the parts of the story which drag in the middle, and that, in the climactic cable car shootout, Gus Bennett's pistol can't seem to run out of bullets. In the supporting cast Paul Henreid is very good, and Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne (Charters and Caldicott) get off their duff and do more than act oblivious, maybe because there's no cricket match in the offing. Another delightful bit is that we get to see Rex Harrison actually croon a song (""Only Love Can Lead the Way"") instead of speaking a song.

Surprisingly, for a Criterion release, there's a dearth of bonus features. We get a rather dry but informative half-hour's worth of discussion between film scholars Peter Evans and Bruce Babington about director Carol Reed, about screenwriters Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, and the sociopolitical climate in which NIGHT TRAIN IN MUNICH was set. There's also a 16-page booklet featuring still photos, a listing of cast & crew and film chapters, and film critic Philip Kemp's essay ""A Last Laugh"" which goes behind-the-scenes of the movie.

And if you do end up liking NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH, why not give these following a try, if you haven't yet: PIMPERNEL SMITH, FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO, and, of course, THE LADY VANISHES.",1278374400,4,4833,4.885365853658537

They are able to kidnap them back to Germany from their safe haven in England, but a British secret agent (Rex Harrison), masquerading as a high-ranking German officer, executes a daring plan to rescue the pair before the scientist's secrets are revealed.

Carol Reed directed this companion film to THE LADY VANISHES, which has a screenplay by the writers of that Hitchcock classic, Sidney Gillant and Frank Launder.  The script has a couple of surprising plot twists, one of which occurs fairly early in the movie.

Rex Harrison, in his first major film role, and Margaret Lockwood are joined in the cast by Paul Henreid (billed as ""Paul Von Hernried"" here), Basil Radford and Naughton Wayne, the latter two repeating their delightful ""very British"" comic cricket aficionados from THE LADY VANISHES, Charters and Caldicott.

The main difference between this and the 1938 movie is that Hitchcock's picture is more of a mystery that begs to be solved (i.e. what happened to the old lady?) while Reed's film is, essentially, a chase melodrama.  Even though NIGHT TRAIN identifies its villains as Nazis, which LADY didn't, neither film is meant to be taken too seriously.

Despite the fact that it employs carefully crafted models (as did THE LADY VANISHES), rather than CGI special effects, the movie remains an exciting, fast-paced espionage thriller that is the equal to today's over-produced movies of that genre.

I just wish that, during the final shoot-out with the Nazis, director Reed (or perhaps the film's editor) had thought to show Harrison reloading his revolver.  I have no idea how many shots he fired, but it was certainly a lot more than six.

Aside from a very good written essay by Philip Kemp in booklet form, the only other extra in this release is 30-minute video conversation about the movie with film scholars Bruce Babington and Peter Evans.

This is one of my favorite ""old"" B&W WWII movies.  I've seen it many, many times on Fox Movie Channel.  I find something ""new"" in it each time.  It might be some background bit or the way a scene is framed.  The train stuff is done well -- a sense of the confined space without a feeling of claustrophobia.

This movie has everything, intrigue, double cross, woman scorned, chase scene, shooting scene, dramatic ending.  It stands on its own.  Does not need to be ""compared"" to other films of the time.

Watch this film.  You won't be disappointed.",1275436800,4,743,4.470149253731344

I hate reviewing DVDs before the disc is actually released, but I have a Roan Group laserdisc of this film, and I've watched it multiple times. Yes, the plot and cast resemble ""The Lady Vanishes"" (and ""Sabotage""), but is that actually a bad thing? This is a great movie, and anyone who likes British films (and especially the British Hitchcock films) will love watching this disc many, many times.

As far as the actual Criterion print is concerned, I can't imagine it being worse than the laserdisc, which is superb.

736110,4,6303934870,"This film was made by the esteemed director Carol Reed.  Maybe you are a big fan of Mr. Reed. If so, and such is your inclination, you might just want to buy this film and add this film to your collection. If you want another person's opinion, however, do read on: An hour goes by before we even see this train. Having watched---and been quite enamored with Margaret Lockwood in ""The Lady Vanishes"" (3/4 of which takes place over rails), and having been impressed by that film's plot, dialogue, and direction I decided to board ""The Night Train to Munich"" so to speak, so as to continue the journey. Oddly, this film is really one without a leading lady's role, notwithstanding Ms. Lockwood's talents. She was wonderful in Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes,"" but here has just not been given enough material to work with.(It's interesting to think that while ""The Lady Vanishes"" title is not at all suggestive of being set aboard a train, ""The Night Train to Munich"" declaratively promotes this notion---notwithstanding the fact that little more than a fifth of it takes place aboard any moving conveyance!)  Yes, Rex Harrison ably carries his own herein, as do Basil Radford & Nauton Wayne (reprising their Charters & Caldicott---captivated by cricket---characters), but such is not enough to carry this film into the station.  Director Carol Reed (of ""The Third Man"" fame) just wasn't given a screenplay commensurate with the quality that those who wrote ""The Lady Vanishes"" provide for this film.  If you are particularly devoted fans of Radford & Wayne,  Harrison, and/or Lockwood you may be interested in seeing this film, but otherwise you'd be better off just watching ""The Lady Vanishes"" again---or ""Strangers on a Train"" if you want suspense along rails.  There are hundreds of average to above-average films out there, so unless you've seen most of the the great ones already---and have seen the best foreign films too, you ought to just consider borrowing fare such as ""The Night Train to Munich"" from your local library (if possible). Yes, some will want to buy this film, but for the average viewer this film really isn't worth $27. It's worth watching, but it may not be a film you will wind up watching numerous times.

736111,4,6303934870,"The Lady Vanishes, almost embassingly so. First, Night Train to Munich,  has Margaret Lockwood. Not bad. There are the two British sports twits abroad to inadvertantly aid & abet their countryman. Of course, the train ride which was mandatory. But the repeat of thoses bloody Czechs. Come on. But my mind flashes back to a successor of Night Train. That is, From Russia With Love. Sean Connery's James Bond is much like Rex Harrison's agent, Gus Bennett. They are both formally schooled, urbane & incredibly witty. This movie was made during World War II so unlike The Lady Vanishes the British didn't feel the need to appease the Nazis. The tape quality is not good. This movie deserves a dvd. A full length commentary with that would sell me.",1246752000,2,744,4.767441860465116

7856403,3,6303934870,"The movie was made in Britain in 1940 and takes place in 1939, when Hitler's forces moved into Czechoslovakia. In Prague, there is an industrial scientist with a possible revolutionary method of armor plate whom the Nazis want to work for them, and British agents smuggle him out, but leave his daughter behind. She is taken to a concentration camp (when they were still prisons rather than centers of genocide) and escapes with another inmate and gets to Britain to reunite with her father. Unfortunately German agents are at work in Britain, and they are forced back to Germany. A British agent poses as a German army officer to try to get them back out.

The movie is effective in showing the harshness and danger of the Nazi regime with relative subtlety (shown by the scenes of people in trouble for saying the wrong things), but it shows the Gestapo as being a little too careless an inept, and the scene with the mountain tram cars being rather unconvincing. Still entertaining as a period piece.",1509494400,,1003,4.731428571428571
7856404,5,6303934870,"The comparisons to The Lady Vanishes have been blown out of proportion. Night Train to Munich is way better and way cooler.  Aside from a couple familiar faces and some scenes on a train there is no comparison for me. If you like spy thrillers such as From Russia with Love and Where Eagles Dare, be sure to give Night Train a shot.

*spolier alert*

Paul Henreid is one of the best parts of this film and his organized escape is brilliant. At first I thought, ""Oh great, another noble anti-Nazi hero. *yawn*"" and then was surprised by the excellent twist that he actually is a Nazi spy.  His dejected look at the end is priceless.

Rex Harrison is adequate, but doesn't come off as likable or believable as Henreid. It was confusing that his character was initially named Gus and then the British couple on the train recognizes him as ""Dicky Randall.""  The first time I watched the film, I was like, ""Wait...who is Dicky Randall??""

A couple other things that weaken the film for me are the fact that the British couple does not show any remorse or even realize that they totally blew his cover as a spy. Nor does Randall seem cross with them about it. Also, how did these two buffoons overpower two armed SS guards on the train?

Overall, a forgotten WWII classic that still feels fresh today. Thank you Criterion for re-releasing it.",1505952000,,1336,4.5375
7856405,5,6303934870,"One of my favorite war films. I first saw this classic many years ago on late night television, but it was simply called ""Night Train"". It was one of the early films of British favorite, Margaret Lockwood. She was clearly the most famous and favorite actress of the 40s and she made many memorable films, including my favorite, the 1944 production of ""Love Story"" AKA known as ""A Woman Surrenders"". NTTM had many twists and surprises that I am not going to repeat as spoilers, but the film was a lot of fun to watch.

to Play in the german speaking and european-part you need a codefree bluray-player.
LANGUAGE: ENGLISH
SUBITLES: ENGLISH SDH

Never seen before this black/White war-movie - well... no surprise.. it's never been released in the german speaking part. Been bit dissapointed because I thought the whole movie is located/played in that one ""Train to Munich"" but at all it's a entertaining and thrilling movie. Paul Henreid (=Paul von Hernreid) is simply hot and charismatic looking and a great actor (and the reason to buy this blu ray).

Interesting: the two characters Charters and Caldicott appearing in 3 more movies: the Lady Vanishes (1938), Crook's Tour (1941), and in Millions Like Us (1943).

The Picture Quality: Clean, sharp with fine Details. It could have been a little bit better and it would have been perfect. But at all... it's good without any dirt, scratches, damages.

The Bonus-Features (only a 29 min conversation about the movie's director) is good but have expected a little bit more.

Fazit: good, entertaining movie (with some factual errors)",1497916800,,1085,5.142045454545454

If he gets away they can track him down by duping his naive daughter. But wait looks like the NSDAP did not plan on mixing wits and guises with tricky Dickey Randall a.k.a. Gus Bennett (Rex Harrison.)

In this film it is hard to not think of Casablanca (1942) when you see Paul von Hernried.

I came to Night Train to Munich (1940) rather backwards first watching The Lady Vanishes (1938). Actors, directors, and writers seem to crossover so many times in films of this time so that you need a program to keep them apart in your mind. The film is mostly compared to other Carol Reed films.

There are plenty of descriptions of the movie. Unfortunately they ether fall short or tell too much detail. I thought at first that it was going to be slow, boring and stilted dialog. Where was the train?

Be sure to get the Criterion version as it give a sort of annotation to the date and time if the film.",1486166400,,1057,4.377551020408164
