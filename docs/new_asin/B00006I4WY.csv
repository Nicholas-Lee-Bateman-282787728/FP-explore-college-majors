7969110,5,B00006I4WY,"My dad (a Viet Nam war veteran) gave me these DVDs to watch when I mentioned that I had been reading a lot about Viet Nam, and war in general, trying to understand what it was all about. He said that he learned a lot from watching this, and I understand why now that I've seen it myself. There's a lot of flag-waving sentiment that sometimes paints a prettier picture than I think really happened, but there are plenty of anti-war movies you can watch to get that point of view. I'm glad someone decided to produce The Long Way Home Project.",1034294400,4,541,4.313725490196078
7969111,5,B00006I4WY,"This is the best documentary ever made about the Vietnam war. They scored an impressive 100% accuracy rating on the facts that I checked. The presentation is low key and visually subtle. The director does not hit you over the head with how clever he is, but each interview, each picture adds to the whole, making a very powerful point. No matter what your preconceptions about the Vietnam War, this will make you confront and rethink them.
This needs to be seen by the electorate, especially is it appears that we may be getting ready to enter into another shooting war. There are questions about our national commitment that need to be addressed before we send off our sons to fight another war. Those question were never addressed in Vietnam, and that was the essential tragedy of the war.
It's an absolute pity that the History Channel won't show this.",1030924800,14,855,4.706666666666667
