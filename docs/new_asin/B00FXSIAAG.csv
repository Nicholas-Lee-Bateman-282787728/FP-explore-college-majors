6036463,5,B00FXSIAAG,Very good!!!,1405296000,,12,5.5
6036464,5,B00FXSIAAG,This is the best biography I have seen of Sam Giancana. With lots of home movies and never before seen pictures. Loved it.,1405123200,2,122,4.3478260869565215
6036465,3,B00FXSIAAG,"Plenty of pictures and speculation as to did Sam Giancana had something to do with the Kennedy assassination, which like most theories on that subject, it has never been proved. The documentary is acceptable, most of the pictures show in black and white, but it is not all that great. 3 Stars.",1401148800,,293,4.653846153846154
6036466,1,B00FXSIAAG,"I had just finished watching the mini series ""The Kennedys"" Sam Giancana was portrayed as someone who wasn't someone you wanted to deal with but this documentary made the man sound like a joke...its so disjointed in its story telling it seems to me no one no one really knew him. Ironically I guess ill have to find a book that does Giancana justice...but this documentary was a waste of time",1399680000,3,392,4.535211267605634
6036467,2,B00FXSIAAG,"Labored, arcane, moves at a glacial pace, and riddled by quaint reminiscences of a whole host of Giancana family members/ associates, make watching this document an exercise in self-discipline. Go to Youtube and watch one of several 45-minute documentaries that will distill Sam Giancana's life down to its essentials, instead of slogging through this documentary.",1399420800,8,364,5.636363636363637
6036468,5,B00FXSIAAG,"What is the truth about Chicago's #2???  This doc. attempts, and seriously so, to run down every alley and corridor that marks this guys's life.  Whether accurate or conjecture it is a fascinating glimpse into a life only heretofore covered in newsprint and Media of that era beginning in the 20's until his death.  A career that connects him to some of the biggest names in show biz and politics.  So many facets of this story are moot, that I sincerely doubt anyone will know exactly who killed him.  Amazing sidelights and interviews with people and players who filled and dotted his life!",1398643200,2,592,4.70873786407767
6036469,4,B00FXSIAAG,"The story of Sam Giancana, told not only using archival material, but from his daughters' point of view.  Not surprisingly, the daughters knew a very different man from the mafia boss.",1484870400,,184,4.935483870967742
6036470,5,B00FXSIAAG,Great historical insight.,1484697600,,25,7.666666666666667
6036471,5,B00FXSIAAG,"This is an excellent documentary on this very complicated man.  A mobster who managed to love his family and at the same time rise to the top of ""The Outfit"" in Chicago.",1483920000,,169,4.28125
6036472,5,B00FXSIAAG,Very interesting story,1483574400,,22,6.666666666666667

6036475,4,B00FXSIAAG,I'm from Chicago.  Always love a good Mafia story,1477612800,,49,4.444444444444445
6036476,3,B00FXSIAAG,"An interesting look at a notorious mobster. Some of it was a little ""conspiracy theory"" disguised as facts. At the end I read the credits and saw that this daughters and grand nephew wrote and produced it. Even though I question a lot of it it was interesting hearing from those close to him.",1477526400,,292,4.425925925925926
6036477,4,B00FXSIAAG,I thought the Nick Celozzi part was unnessessaryy and disingenuous,1476921600,,66,5.7
6036478,5,B00FXSIAAG,Is just an interesting to see how theses  gangsters get away with crime back in the days,1475020800,,88,4.176470588235294
6036479,3,B00FXSIAAG,He was a great husband and father but also a ruthless murderer. Everyone has a good side....even monsters.,1474848000,,106,4.944444444444445

6036482,4,B00FXSIAAG,this was so well done. my heart went out to the daughters too.,1473984000,,62,3.8461538461538463
6036483,5,B00FXSIAAG,"Fast paced and insightful, this shows both the human and inhumane sides of the gang leader. The double life included murder/brutality and short tempered nature that drew too much attention to the mob world and led to his demise, and his daughters who felt raptured by his presence and kindness he infused in their lives. Was the mob responsible for JFK's assassination? This movie leaves no doubt that its makers believe it was. Were the sex lives of the almighty Kennedys and others given mostly a nod and a wink by the media? You bet. This is a well-done tale no matter where your politics reside.",1473984000,2,599,4.660377358490566
6036484,5,B00FXSIAAG,Excellent!  History that makes sense.,1473465600,,37,6.4
6036485,4,B00FXSIAAG,"The info provided in this documentary  answered many questions about, among other things, the Kennedy assassination.  It concurs with other info, not in this doc, about many political and non political events that occurred during this time period.  Very interesting.  My only complaint is that the quality of the video was not great, very grainy.",1473465600,,346,5.236363636363636
6036486,3,B00FXSIAAG,"I found it amusing that when the narrator was talking about a west side restaurant called ""Mary's"", the accompanying image was of a restaurant called ""Hamburger Mary's""  located in Andersonville.  Makes one wonder how competent the research was in other areas.",1473292800,2,260,5.317073170731708
6036487,4,B00FXSIAAG,Good documentary.,1473206400,,17,8.0
6036488,4,B00FXSIAAG,His karma finally caught up with him. He lived by the sword and died the same way.,1472774400,,82,3.8823529411764706

6036491,4,B00FXSIAAG,"If you like mob stories, then this is a good one. Very interesting.",1470700800,,67,4.230769230769231
6036492,2,B00FXSIAAG,Not worth watching,1470700800,,18,5.333333333333333
6036493,1,B00FXSIAAG,"Did not like this movie. I really tried to watch it all the way through and couldn't. What I did watch was a waste of time. I found it mostly boring, slow moving, and seemed like it was heading no where. Finally gave up.",1470009600,,220,4.0227272727272725
6036494,3,B00FXSIAAG,Informative.,1469923200,,12,12.0
6036495,5,B00FXSIAAG,Very interesting. Gave a more three dimensional look at the man.,1469836800,,64,4.909090909090909
6036496,4,B00FXSIAAG,Pretty good account of this notorious crime boss.,1469836800,,49,5.25
6036497,4,B00FXSIAAG,"Another informative documentary. Live by the gun, die by the gun.",1469664000,,65,5.0
6036498,2,B00FXSIAAG,"At some point I felt like I wanted to execute the cross-eyed idiot daughter.  It's much longer than is warranted, and the best stuff is quickly passed over - Jack Ruby.  The guy is a killer.  He loved his children.  So did all the others he murdered.",1469404800,,250,4.25531914893617
6036499,1,B00FXSIAAG,Loved it....,1469404800,,12,5.5
6036500,4,B00FXSIAAG,"I just watched this last night as it was included in Amazon Prime. I have been fascinated about the different accounts of the JFK assassination since my childhood, and the suggested connections between Giancana, Joe Kennedy, JFK, Bobby Kennedy, Jack Ruby, Oswald (if true) in this film are plausible. It moves rather slow for the first hour with interviews with Giancana's daughters, but the last hour ties up some loose ends in the tangled web of the mafia-JFK conspiracy theory.",1469404800,,480,5.0125
6036501,5,B00FXSIAAG,The story was a true account of a Chicago mobster who ran the Chicago mob!,1469404800,,74,4.0
6036502,4,B00FXSIAAG,Very informative. Learned some things I didn't know,1468972800,,51,5.5
6036503,5,B00FXSIAAG,"Liked this movie, I like movies based on true stories, and real people's lives. If you likes these type movies, Inthink this one is for you.",1468627200,,140,4.423076923076923
6036504,3,B00FXSIAAG,"Very informative, although sometimes somewhat overwrought.",1468540800,,58,8.833333333333334
6036505,4,B00FXSIAAG,I would recommend renting it. Definitely not a 5 star movie.,1468540800,,60,4.545454545454546

6036509,4,B00FXSIAAG,Interesting information,1465257600,,23,11.0
6036510,4,B00FXSIAAG,Informative but it seemed to move very slowly.,1464998400,,46,4.875

6036512,4,B00FXSIAAG,I have always enjoyed mob related documentaries.,1464566400,,48,6.0
6036513,5,B00FXSIAAG,Very interesting and eye opening documentary about the life & times of Sam Giancana.  The producer did a good job of linking Giancana to the failed assignation of Fidel Castro.  Lot's of interesting factoids & vintage footage of the times.,1463184000,,239,4.95
6036514,5,B00FXSIAAG,Super Duper awsome...!!!! will sure open up your EYE'S on a LOT of things,1463097600,,73,4.285714285714286
6036515,5,B00FXSIAAG,Excellent biography.,1462665600,,20,9.5
6036516,2,B00FXSIAAG,"Terrible. There's no real source material here except boring reminiscences of the Giancana family about how nice their father was. Their father was a stone cold killer, a murderer responsible for hateful acts, many deaths, corruption and destroying people lives and corrupting the American dream. This 'doc' whitewashes all of that (if it didn't it might have been more interesting), and doesn't really get into detail about the man. Additionally, it has many facts wrong. For example, it states that JFK reneged on his promise for air cover in the Bay of Pigs. That is incorrect and easy to find that the truth is more complicated that a simple finger pointing. Do I need to say that the interviews all look like they were filmed by an amateur? The lighting is lousy and the 'experts' are unconvincing and have no depth. A waste of time.",1460073600,3,838,4.786206896551724
6036517,5,B00FXSIAAG,Interesting piece of history.,1459296000,,29,6.5

6036521,2,B00FXSIAAG,It was OK. I liked the differences between the two daughters. Interesting to think that the Msguire sister got the money,1457740800,,120,4.761904761904762
6036522,5,B00FXSIAAG,Interesting,1457308800,,11,11.0
6036523,4,B00FXSIAAG,Seemed to cover most of Giancans's life so I gave it 4 stars. But they could have told more of his life in regards to his relations with the Kennedys/,1456876800,,150,4.033333333333333
6036524,3,B00FXSIAAG,Nothing more than OK,1456617600,,20,4.25

6036529,1,B00FXSIAAG,Horrible,1453852800,,8,8.0
6036530,5,B00FXSIAAG,"Excellent ""birds eye view"" into the man, the father and the mobster.
The connection with Jack Ruby throughout confirms the mob's involvement with the Kennedy assassination.",1453507200,,172,5.653846153846154
6036531,2,B00FXSIAAG,"Interesting, but nothing really new about the subject.",1453161600,,54,5.875
6036532,4,B00FXSIAAG,"If you have an interest in organized crime, this is pretty interesting and well worth seeing.",1447718400,,93,4.875
6036533,5,B00FXSIAAG,"Absolutely fascinating.  The complexities of this man were astounding.  Having grown up in the 60s I surely had heard of him, knew that he was a gangster, knew about Chicago,Vegas and Cuba.  But Jacob Rubenstein, Bobbie and President Kennedy and the very close connections!  Wow.  This was riveting.",1447113600,,299,5.145833333333333
6036534,5,B00FXSIAAG,Good documentary,1446940800,,16,7.5
6036535,3,B00FXSIAAG,Poor photography diminished the chance for extra stars. Some of the most important episodes got too short coverage.,1443139200,,115,5.444444444444445
6036536,5,B00FXSIAAG,It's a great documentary! Loved it,1443139200,,34,4.833333333333333
6036537,1,B00FXSIAAG,SO Boring! Do I really care that he had 2 christmas trees each year? Terrible film making...more like propaganda about what a swell guy he was. Waste of time.,1442707200,2,158,4.482758620689655
6036538,3,B00FXSIAAG,Interesting,1441497600,,11,11.0

6036543,3,B00FXSIAAG,"It must have been difficult to edit the story of Sam Giancana into a short video presentation.  I did, however, find the storyline as well as the home movies, interesting.",1434240000,,171,4.7
6036544,5,B00FXSIAAG,"There is so much revealed in this show about the unbelievable connections between major players of the mob and our government and CIA and FBI, Jack Ruby and Oswald that it's hard to comprehend. A must watch for everyone.  I've went back and watched it several times. You may never look at our government the same.",1433289600,,313,4.589285714285714
6036545,5,B00FXSIAAG,"For all of us who knew the Kennedy clan from Massachusetts, this was a reaffirmation of the fallout of their arrogant aggressiveness in politics. They pushed too hard and the results were so tragic for themselves and our nation. Far from being Camelot, this was a fair assessment allowing the viewer to conclude for themselves what happened on the grassy knoll. One of the best documentaries I have viewed. Bravo!",1432944000,,413,4.914285714285715

Considering all the theories around the Kennedy assassination, it's amazing he wasn't shot a hundred times. The mob, the CIA, the Russians, the Republicans, the FBI,  the Federal Reserve, Castro! Jeez! This guy pissed off everybody. Did anyone like him?

6036552,4,B00FXSIAAG,"I enjoyed this documentary.  Since there are still a lot of questions regarding Kennedy's assignation, it was interesting to see one more opinion or insight.  I had never heard of Sam Giancaca before now, so I liked it. Daughters indicate Sam was really a nice guy?  Being their father I guess one  would be biased.  In reality he killed and from this doc appeared to be a real SOB. How can one be a nice guy while being a ruthless hit man?",1427673600,2,440,4.317073170731708

6036561,4,B00FXSIAAG,I have read many books on the Kennedy's. After seeing this and listening to key people give their first hand accounts I can see a real possibility to this mafia connection to the Kennedy assassination in Dallas. The Marilyn connection was another real component.  Sam was a very strong and complex character. Now I need to go watch The Godfather.,1415923200,,346,4.766666666666667
