4451197,5,B004QOB8UC,"This high quality series continues with no let-down whatsoever.  To the contrary, the plot and ambience are satisfying in a very dramatic way, the characters are well drawn, the music is moody and the dog is fantastic as usual.  For some reason, however, this film endows the actors with some quirky speech mannerisms which can be somewhat distracting. But one can easily put up with all of that given the excellent mix of cinematic sophistication and entertainment which is quite rare for a prime time television movie.",1306108800,81,520,4.9655172413793105

""Cop-ly intuition."" - Jesse Stone

Five ABSORBING Stars. This TV movie ""Innocents Lost"" begins as a patiently developed Jesse Stone character study. He is out of the job as Paradise Police Chief, in therapy, still drinking, still consulting, and there is Reggie. There are a number of women who are attracted to him. And there are the usual cast of regular characters among his associates: two Paradise police officers, a state homicide police official, a nun, a used car dealer, the ex-wife, a mob boss, and a dog. Jesse is running two cases, one of which is very personal, a dead friend, and he's meeting some opposition. Co-starring Kathy Baker, Kohl Sudduth, William Sadler, Stephen McHattie, Sal Rubinek, Gloria Reuben, Eileen Boylan, Kerri Smith, and Ben Watson. Directed by Dick Lowery. Co-written by Selleck. Highly Recommended.  Five DECISIVE Stars. (Brandman Productions. Rated R. Color. HD. X-Ray. Time-1:30:45.)",1467936000,3,925,5.243243243243243

The stories are good, the character Jesse Stone played by Tom Selleck is great. Tough to not like these. I would order again as these movies are in a rare group that I re-watch.

Tom Selleck was born to play certain types of roles, tough but principled cops with flaws, wisecracking characters with dry humor and heroes that don't stand out as comic-book quality.  Characters like Thomas Magnum, Frank Reagan, Peter Mitchell, Matthew Quigly, Indiana Jones and Jesse Stone.  The latter is one of his finest, and plays directly to the character created by Robert B. Parker.",1431907200,,655,5.093457943925234

4452254,5,B004QOB8UC,"Another great movie, in a great series of movies, about Jesse Stone.

 These are done well and have a great cast performing characters worth caring about. Since there is an order to them it
would be better to watch them chronologically but if you see them out of order they still hold up, just minus a bit of back story
for the characters. I'm sure you're intelligent enough to follow this intelligent cop drama, no matter what order you see them in.

 I numbered my DVDs so when I watch them again it will all be okay.  ;>)

 I'm probably biased on this BUT I do own all of the movies in the series and am hoping that more will be made.

 Love Reggie also.",1411171200,,657,4.192

4452468,5,B004QOB8UC,"Tom Selleck has come into his own as Paradise Police Chief Jesse Stone. I initially rented the DVDs through Red Box a couple of years ago, and watched them again and some new episodes on Netflix. Fortunately, Amazon has all but the ""Benefit of the Doubt"" produced in 2012.  C'mon Amazon, what are you waiting for?

I just read a write-up about the Jesse Stone series on Wikipedia, and although the last movie garnered an astounding 13,000,000 viewers in 2012, CBS, in their infinite wisdom, has decided to not produce any more. Seems like the shows that become tiresome the networks keep. While the more excellent ones and wildly popular, like Jesse Stone, they drop. In CBS's case, their justification for dropping the series is because they want to target those under 50! What the heck!?!?

I truly hope that Tom Selleck continues to seek avenues to continue the series. He simply excels in this role and is great to watch as his character and his faithful colleagues fight the good fight.",1395187200,,991,4.75

Just a little too slow and too much of the same quotes repeated over and over again - it gets old.

4452699,1,B004QOB8UC,"Usually I like this Jesse Stone series;  but it was hard going watching this latest one:  watching a chronically depressed person who can't connect, even with his dog (poor thing), is a bit of a bore.  Don't understand why the ex-wife keeps answering the phone....a bit phony, I've always thought.  The earlier segments were much better and faster paced.",1374624000,,354,4.9491525423728815
4452700,5,B004QOB8UC,I have a series of dvd's in which Tom Selleck  portrays the Chief of Police/detective.

4452704,4,B004QOB8UC,"The detective genre is hard to translate from written page to TV screen. Where readers delight in the chestnuts carried over from previous books, they fall hard on video. It doesn't mean that they serve no purpose; the measured pace of dialogue requires shortcuts. So Jesse says: ""Because I like you"" to disguise his real reason for interviewing Gino Fish. You must guess why. He watches a clip of an old Jimmie Stewart movie, 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington', about corruption.
Jesse is Retired, but he looks for clues to the murder of a young college woman. Irritating the powers in Paradise, he pursues a predator. His casual attitude toward personal safety allows him to take risks that civil servants cannot. The music, a staple of each film, sets a slow pace for the unfolding plot. This is an excellent counterpoint to the testerone-fueled action movies available otherwise. I like the retribution Jesse hands out.
As always, the rocky inlets and coast form a backdrop for the production.",1372464000,,992,4.910714285714286

As usual, something really terrible has happened in Paradise and for the duration of the movie we're quietly pinned to our seats unmoving as the solid acting carries us along with the evolving plot. The familiar haunting piano theme is like another actor, unseen but felt in every frame. And, as always, the camera work is extraordinary, painting Paradise so cleanly and clearly that everyone I know wants to live there... if it wasn't such a tranquilly dangerous place.

Quality of acting, filming, plot, music....  how all of these are brought together to be equal elements so fully integrated and so wonderfully interdependent make these made for television movies noticeable jewels, appreciated and valued by us loyal fans of this series.  Great work!

4452970,5,B004QOB8UC,"I have enjoyed the whole series of Tom Selleck's roll as Jesse Stone in Robert Parker's stories.  I was impressed to see that Selleck is credited as one of the writers in this episode. It was sad to see the problems of some of characters because they seem like members of mine or anybody's family.  It's like going home to one of the most beautiful areas in America in each story.

The whole tone and tenor of the character and mood the entire series is refreshing compared to the loud clashing messes that are most movies today. Love the music too.  Also love William Sadler's perfmances and roll.  One of my favorite actors.

What I enjoy most is that we get to see the character development personal flaws that we all share in a low-key but intense development.

This is one series that I think the first one was not necessarily the best.  It has seemed that each one staid true to the theme but got better with each story.

Magnum PI was fun, but I think this character for Selleck shows a side of his acting skills that hasn't been seen in his previous work.",1340236800,,1063,4.38265306122449
4452971,4,B004QOB8UC,"Compared to the other episodes in this series, this one seemed a bit quirkier.  And they're all quirky to be sure, which is part of their charm.

The extreme quirkiness related to pacing and plot.  It was like the writers and producers--Selleck and Brandman--were having fun toying with the structure of the show.  Jesse was more moody and introspective than usual--and who can blame him as he was recently fired from being Police Chief.  This show accurately mirrors the times and perhaps they wanted to do that for viewers.  To say, you're not alone. Even the dog looked more depressed than usual. Many are going through tough times now and we get it.

However, the anchoring crime--the overdose of the young friend of Jesse's--it didn't seem like a mystery to be solved so much.  Again, maybe more like real life.  Then there was the investigation of the young man in Boston who the head of homicides doubted his guilt.  Jesse figured that one out by thinking about it mainly which was fascinating and impressive--but not much investigation. Seems like that was an interesting case and could have been amped up more. There wasn't a lot of suspense in this show.  And maybe that's okay.  It seemed Jesse's personal life dominated. I like 1/4 personal life and 3/4 investigation/mystery--especially as Jesse's personal life is so darn depressing!

I DO like the new girlfriend.  That was a bright spot in the show. Hope they keep her around.  Hasty Healy, the shrink, and Gino Fine are ALWAYS a delight as secondary characters.  The new police chief has the ability to annoy and amuse so he should be a fun character to watch.

The cinematography was exceptional in this: the rain splashing against the camera lens in the opening scene, coffee being poured, cutting away during an action and coming back and finding other characters were now there.  That was very effective and creative.

I did like the artistic sense of this episode and the experimentation, but the plot lines maybe could have been intensified a tad, although the conclusion was very satisfying.",1339632000,,2065,4.865329512893982

4452973,3,B004QOB8UC,"I was so excited in May of 2011 when this was going to be on the TV and just waited for that Sunday night.  The night came and I started watching and wouldn't you know it - bad weather alerts.  I live in Southeast Kansas and in the spring we do get used to programs being interrupted by weather updates.  Well that night they just kept going and going and finally didn't even try to get back to the movie.  We get two CBS stations, one in Tulsa and one in Pittsburg, KS and both stations just stayed on the weather for what seemed to be the rest of the evening.  I gave up and after knowing that my area wasn't in any immediate danger, I switched to cable.

Turns out that was the night that Joplin got decimated by a tornado.  I felt about an inch high for complaining about not getting to see this movie while people were killed, injured and left homeless.  I felt even less than an inch high after going to Joplin and seeing the devastation that tornado did.  So time passes and I still haven't seen this movie and now a new one was going to be on TV.  I like things in chronological order (when possible) so I bought it for $4.99 and watched it and DVRed the new one.

It was okay but when it was finished I found my self going back in the movie thinking that I missed something.  Turns out that I didn't miss anything and it was just over.  Not the best but again maybe I just had my hopes up too high after the problems of it's airing on TV and my associated feelings and just wanting to watch it.  Probably is just me but I just rate this as an okay movie and not near one of the best of the Jesse Stone movies.  (The new one was great - by the way.)",1337904000,,1657,4.0244648318042815
4452974,2,B004QOB8UC,"I have very much enjoyed the former movies in this series but Innocents Lost was a big disappointment.  It has become stock and cliched.  Parker had his characters show some development.  By the end of the Jesse Stone series of books Stone had gotten his drinking under control and had resolved his issues of dependency on his ex-wife and  the character in the books was always more complex than Selleck's performance in this latest movie.  The unrelieved gloom, the same dialogue rehashed from earlier movies, the same old scenes with Dr. Dix, with Gino Fish and with Sister Mary John, the same staring matches with the dog are all getting very tedious and frankly, unbelievable.  It's hardly credible that Tom Selleck's character can't even pat his dog.  Also, the scenes with Dix, Fish and Mary John seemed forced.  It's as if these actors have a run-of-the-series contract and have to be written in.  Speaking of writing, perhaps writing is not Tom Selleck's greatest strength. The latest movie in the series is to be broadcast this coming Sunday night.  Based on the movie I just watched I have serious doubts that it will be worth watching.",1336867200,,1146,4.8307692307692305

Tom Selleck and the entire support casts (which vary) of each of the movies do an excellent job of keeping the stories interesting and moving along.  Although he is at the center of each story and there is a subtext and plot running throughout each, a viewer can watch each piece independently of the other and be satisfied.  The soundtrack to this series is excellent and really enhances the mood and the cinematography is stunning.  I really like that Tom's portrayal of Jesse is flawed vs. perfect and yet ultimately you are rooting for him to succeed and are genuinely sorry if/when any harm comes to him and/or his cadre of loyal friends and colleagues who help him make it through the night, one day at a time.  The only quibble I have is that by movie #7, I think it's time for him to really let his ex-wife and her voicemail messages go and move on for good.",1332979200,,916,4.428571428571429

4452990,3,B004QOB8UC,"Author Robert Parker is perhaps best known for the series of books he wrote about his private detective Spenser, mostly due to the popularity of the TV series which starred the late Robert Urich. But he began a series of books based on a second character named Jesse Stone and those stories have been turned into TV films starring Tom Selleck in the lead role. The latest has just arrived on DVD.

As the film opens Jesse is dealing with a form of depression, falling back into old habits of drinking (the character has a history of alcoholism) after being placed into forced retirement by the town council of Paradise, the town he lives in. The head of that group has plans for Jesse's position, namely inserting his son in law as the head of the police department.

Jesse ends up having more to worry about when a young woman named Cindy Van Alden (Eileen Boylan) turns up dead, an apparent suicide. This was a young girl that Jesse had helped in the past, getting her into rehab and trying to save her life. The new police chief is more concerned with the tourist trade in town and the damage the death of a local tied to drugs could do. So Jesse takes it upon himself to look deeper into the girl's death.

Without a badge how can he do so? Jesse was recently asked by his friend Healy of the State Police to assist in a different investigation. This side story takes up little of Jesse's time and permits him to carry a badge while looking into Cindy's past.

It turns up that Cindy's rehab experience wasn't quite what Jesse thought it would be. As he talks to the doctor that heads the facility he learns that the man is a resident of Paradise and that for all the talk of trying to save people's lives the facility is actually a rehab mill, a place that offers a quick fix to addicts and then turns them lose with little or no follow up.

As Jesse puts together the pieces of the puzzle elements of the Russian mob, an assist from a former foe named Gino (William Sadler) and taking on the responsibility he felt he ignored that resulted in the young girl's death all come to play. The guilt of her death weighs heavy on his shoulders and inspires him to find justice for another life lost.

This film is quite different than most mysteries seen today. Rather than count on heavy duty gunfire and fast paced car chases, the film focuses on character development and dialogue that rolls smoothly rather than at a whip snake pace. Conversations seem like conversations and words by all characters are chosen wisely so as to not trip themselves up, the result being placed in jail.

Selleck does a great job as Jesse Stone, a man with a troubled past and who is currently troubled with the present. He intends on taking back his job, the only one he's truly ever known and excelled at. The town council may be more interested in the appearance of the town on the surface but Jesse is concerned with justice and the safety of the people who live there. At the same time his inner demons have started him drinking again and the depression he deals with has caused him to seek help in a psychiatrist/ex-cop played by William Devane.

The pacing of the film seems incredibly slow but on reflection you realize that it's just the story unfolding in the most natural way possible. Plot devices aren't tossed in randomly and the interaction between characters makes this a much better film than one would expect.

Parker only finished 9 novels with this character before his death.  This story was written by the man continuing the tales of Jesse Stone, Michael Brandman, and Selleck himself. They've done a great job and one can only hope to see more.",1332201600,,3650,4.5

4452999,5,B004QOB8UC,"Innocents Lost should have been named Redemption, because that is the primary theme in this movie starring Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone, sometimes chief of police in Paradise Massachusetts. The previous movie in this series was lame, this one excellent.

Most of the characters from previous books and movies are back, including officers Luther ""Suitcase"" Simpson and Rose Gammon, State Police Captain Healy, Boston mob boss Gino Fish, and even former Paradise city councilman - and former criminal, Hasting Hathaway

Redemption is the key to this movie. Hathaway is thinking of putting himself up again for city council as a reformed criminal who has learned his lesson from his past jail time.  Gino Fish gets a bit of redemption by identifying a bad guy who has gone against Fish's strange code of criminal behavior.  Suitcase follows his own code of honor (taught to him by Stone) by resigning because he does not like the thoroughly unlikable new Police Chief. And Healy and Stone earn a few good points to weigh against past sins by getting a kid wrongly convicted of murder freed from that charge.

Without giving too much of the plot away I will tell you that as always in these Jesse Stone movies there are multiple storylines going on, some finished with a bang and some left hanging waiting for a yet another sequel.",1328745600,,1325,4.845132743362832

4453028,1,B004QOB8UC,"I avoided buying the latest slumberfest in the Jesse Stone series because they've been getting slower as each new mistake gets released.  I liked the first two, then Jessie's droopy, slouching, What Am I Doing Here stupor just got to be annoying.  Tom Selleck co-'wrote' this. Between his so-very-tired-of-living demeanor and the brainless dialog, I can't imagine what he had on his mind to take this drivel into a studio. A screen writing class would do well to use this um, 'movie' to start a discussion on how a screen writer should move the plot forward with each scene.  You don't have to blow things up, just use character interactions with other characters or things to illustrate their history, current view of their purpose in life/mission, and perhaps lead the viewer to anticipate alternative futures coming up, toying with them by using those threads as you develop the story.  You don't just put two thorazined actors in a room or at the sea shore and have them stare and mumble.  Say there were, oh, 70 scenes filmed for assembly in the editing room.  The editor of this sleeper has my sympathy.  He or she was given 95% of just mope around the set dopey nothingess to wrap around maybe 20 minutes of light-weight who done it content.  The story boards would reflect scene setups like, ......... (blank space intended), Jesse stares at dog.  Dog stares at Jesse.  Tom/Jesse and mentor/counselor William DeVane stare, then exchange barely-awake witless dialog.  I just don't know how the director could do it.  Probably just hit 'stun' and went for a coffee break while the camera rolled.  Mabye you can use this to keep the pets company while you're out shopping.

Parker is a master at creating flawed characters and Selleck brings this one emphatically to the screen.

The novels are great reads but the methods he uses to get the crimes solved is more logical than fictional. Tom Selleck is great in the role and the decision for CBS to continue producing more will probably come down to whether or not Selleck is available.

The DVD contains little in the way of extras, which is a shame. I had hoped there would be more behind-the-scenes features, especially since this is a fairly new series and it more than possible when compared with vintage television programs.",1322006400,,577,4.6568627450980395

4453044,5,B004QOB8UC,"For those who like Tom Selleck's work, [and for the most part I do.] I think these are some of his finest.  This is a venue that, I feel, fits his natural style of a understated, underestimated, self assured, and undefeated life.  When you are being yourself, and not try convince them you are this character, it is easier to engage the audience in the story.  The style of this series and the quality of the acting by the ensemble cast and great walk-in's is so understated and direct that it smacks of this same reality.  This occasional style of release also keeps it from being too much like a ""Soap Opera.""  The contigual  nature of the background characters, really adds to the background story dimension.  [except for Sissy? nymphomaniac ex-wife of the banker. Who seems to change actresses every episode or so...]

But what I really like about the series is that it is the old story of a boy, his personal flaws, and his dog, who save their little corner of the world every now and then.

4453063,3,B004QOB8UC,"I'm a fan of Tom Selleck and the Jesse Stone movie series. I've seen all of them now, including ""Innocents Lost."" Unfortunately, ""Innocents Lost"" does not live up to the quality of the earlier releases. Once more, Tom Selleck takes on the role of Jesse Stone - ex-LAPD homicide detective and now ex-Paradise Police Chief. As usual, the story revolves around Stone dealing with a mysterious crime while also dealing with his personal issues - alcohol, estrangement from his ex-wife and isolation. Add his new ""retired"" status and Stone seems to be at his lowest ebb. All this adds to the trademark moodiness of the series - well and good, but the majority of the scenes and much of the dialogue seems to be cut-and-paste from the earlier movies. The pace is plodding and somewhat disjointed and the ending was all too predictable. It is obvious from the last scene that more movies are planned - I just hope they can re-capture the essence of the earlier works.

I still gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars because I like the characters and hope that this is merely a lull in an otherwise interesting and enjoyable series. My fear is that Mr. Selleck and company are beginning to phone in their work which tells me the end may be drawing near for the Jesse Stone series.",1317859200,,1265,4.572687224669603

4453079,2,B004QOB8UC,"The first three Stone films were awesome.
The next three were quite good.
The latest, Innocents Lost, was a big disappointment.

1) In this latest film they re-use lines from previous Stone films way too much.  It happens so often that it's kichy.  One use would be nice, two...maybe, but this became dumb after a dozen of them.  In this film, a young girl dies and we learn that supposedly, she and Jesse were very close friends in the past.  She calls Jesse her ""best friend.""  2) I'm all for adding new characters, but this felt forced and thrown in.  Why not just make it one of the young women Jesse was actually friends with in the earlier films??  3) The new chief was not the same actor as the last film when he was interviewing for a job.  That's okay, you can't always get the same actors to return.  But this guy is not even the same character--what happened there?  4) What happened to Molly Crane?  Did I miss something or is she still out of FMLA?  Viewers want her back (or at least we want to know what happened  5) The dialogue (what was a hallmark of these films) seems rushed and shallow in this latest film.  6) But perhaps the biggest disappointment is what's happening to Jesse.  He's a cop who has some problems, but he's always had something special where it really counts.  However, in this film, he is losing this.  The parts of Jesse that are pathetic are drowning out any inner strength he had.  We like the complicated nature of his character (in all the other movies), but if he's made into too much of a looser, we lose sight of his white hat.  When this happens, he's no longer complicated and thus, no longer interesting.",1317340800,22,1654,4.413907284768212

In particular, it was difficult to see Jesse acting pathetic, borrowing cars and badges and more or less being someone who uses his friendships to get what he wants. This is not the character I have come to  love watching.  The character's untreated depression is beginning to take over as a central feature of the movie.  The movie featured, in part, a storyline about a girl that has supposedly been Jesse's friend, someone we have not heard of in the past movies.  There was no resolve to Jesse losing his position as police chief.  The entire movie seemed poorly planned.  I look forward to the next movie and hope he starts to come around because the way the character behaved in this movie was just too hard to watch.",1316736000,2,876,4.535031847133758

Selleck teases us at the beginning with a comment that 'he will get his job back.'  Part way through the movie he decides that he can squeeze another movie out of this concept, so throws in a bunch of padding to give the required 90 minutes and leaves the 'getting his job back' to yet another movie.

4453091,3,B004QOB8UC,"This one does not appear to be something written by Dr. Parker. Rather, it was likely loosely based on Parker's  Jessie Stone series. Parker would not  go much beyond dragging his main character down past his drinking problem and his inability to shed his former wife known only as Jenn. This one is just too depressing overstepping the bounds of Stone's usual world. We see into a world  where Stone has little or no control of his destiny to the point where he is fired from his job as police chief and we see sense his former colleagues beginning to drift away. The series had a good thing going with the ongoing threat of  Stone's being fired by the town council. I also miss the Molly Crane character played by Viola Davis.

We see in other such made for TV series and follow-on movies the breakup of a good thing when the writers try to take things in a new direction. See for example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Zorro-Widescreen-Special-Edition/dp/B000CEXGAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Zorro (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Veronica-Mars-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000NA2BEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Veronica Mars: The Complete Third Season</a>.

Spencer nearly always had a strong team behind him and he did not have the myriad personal problems of Stone.

In short this piece has too many negatives for it to have achieved the critical mass a good story should have. It is one thing to throw everything you've got at your protagonist to make the drama interesting.  But when you practically destroy your character's world, the overwhelming gloom is too much and the drama fails.

On the positive side, it was nice to see that Stone now has retrieved the Brahms Intermezzo from the floor where he had previously thrown it and was playing it again.",1315785600,,2512,6.154285714285714

4453111,4,B004QOB8UC,"When it comes to television, I only have a few favorite shows that I enjoy watching on a regular basis.  Right now it's Justified, Dexter, The Big C with Laura Linney and Oliver Platt, and the ""Jesse Stone"" series, starring Tom Selleck.  The Big C and the ""Jesse Stone"" series, however, are the only two shows that yank at my heart strings and make me feel something other than the adrenaline rush associated with violent action and horror scares.

For me the ""Jesse Stone"" television series (CBS only televises about one show a year)  is about people with weaknesses, struggling to do the right thing and sometimes failing in their quest.  It's about deep loss and the things people do to cope with it.  The stories also deal with love, especially the love a man has for his ex-wife and being unable to let go, whether it's addiction, co-dependence, or obsession.  Let's not forget about the theme of action and reaction, and dealing with the consequences.  The stories concern themselves with addiction, the things that cause us to become addicted, and the gradual, but very hard road to recovery.  It's about how good people do bad things and how sometimes bad people do good things when you least expect it.  It's about friendship and how we treat our friends on a day-to-day basis.  In many ways, it's also a show about life and death, and how we live our lives during the brief time we're given.

Whenever a new ""Jesse Stone"" movie comes on TV, it like revisiting with old friends you haven't seen in a few years.  There's a comforting feeling about it.  I think that's why so many viewers enjoy this series with Tom Selleck in it.  For me, it was no different with Innocents Lost.  It was just like picking up where No Remorse ended, except that Robert Harmon wasn't directing this time out.  Dick Lowry took over the reins of that position.

Spoiler Alert!  So don't read any further if you have a problem with that.  Anyway, this time around a new police chief has taken over Jesse's job in Paradise.  His name is William Butler, and he's the son-in-law of councilman, Carter Hanson, the guy who wanted Jesse fired from his job.  Jesse, however, was forcibly retired, which means that he at least has an income to live off of, though it may not be much. The reason I say ""not much"" is because when he visits Dr. Dix for this therapy sessions, he has to start running a tab for a while because he can't afford to pay $180 an hour for a shrink.  The two cases Jesse gets involved with in this movie have to do with the death of a young friend, Cindy Van Aldan, whom he'd lost contact with; yet, she dies from a drug overdose on her way to see him.  The second case is through Captain Healy in Boston.  A man arrested for the murder of a convenience store owner is about to be sentenced, and Healy thinks he's actually innocent of the crime.  Healy wants Jesse Stone to find proof of the accused person's innocence before the sentencing takes place.  Jesse will take on the job, but only if the state police captain gives him a badge to use.  Jesse, of course, then uses the badge to delve into the death of his friend, which later gets him into trouble with Healy.  Still, thanks to the help of Sister Mary John and Gino Fish, Jesse is able to track down the killer of his friend and then sets everything up so the killer will come after him.  The case for Healy also falls together, though not quite in the way they expected.  By the end of the show, Suitcase has quit the force, and who knows what Rose will do down the road.  Right now, she needs the job.

Anyway, it was fun seeing Kathy Baker back again as Rose Gamon, one of the officers on Jesse's old police force, along with Kohl Sudduth as police officer Luther ""Suitcase"" Simpson.  William Devane as Dr. Dix always delivers a quirky, yet powerful performance.  Saul Rubinek is back as Hasty Hathaway, and he still thinks Jesse had an affair with his ex-wife, though he is still quite fond of Jesse.  And, let's not forget Stephen McHattie as Captain Healy.  He's the kind of friend every man needs when times get tough.  Then there's the lovely Kerri Smith as Sister Mary John, and you wonder if she and Jesse will ever get together for more than dinner and a discussion about girls and drug addiction.  William Sadler as Gino Fish is almost a likable guy now that he's put Jesse on the list of people he'll see at any time and helps the ex-cop to find the killer of Cindy.  It also helps that Gino has a new personal assistant manning the front office now that Allen is dead--the provocative and beautiful and ultra sexy Amanda, played by Christine Tizzard.  For me, she's much more pleasant to look at than Allen was though she shares the dead Allen's attitude.  To put it bluntly, Amanda's snooty.

I have to admit that this particular show had an extremely large amount of beautiful actresses in it, and it makes me wonder if Tom Selleck had anything to do with the casting.  There's Gloria Rueben, who plays Hasty's secretary and Jesse's love interest.  Rae Ritke plays Cindy's mother, and I have to say she could easily give the women of Desperate Housewives  a run for their money.  Stacey Smith plays the college administrator that Jesse visits to find out more about Cindy, and she's a looker, too.

Here's one thing, however, that needs to be fixed in the series.  The Jesse Stone character has had his dog, Reggie, since the first episode.  It's about time he started playing with him.  Gosh, the sad expressions on Reggie's face breaks my heart each time I see it.  Playing with a dog takes more than patting the cushion next to you to see if the animal dog will come over.  Most dogs need attention and to be played with on a daily basis by their owners.  After all, dogs have feelings, too.  If Jessie doesn't start treating Reggie right, I'm going to call the Dog Whisperer.

While I'm ranting, here's another thing that's starting to disturb me.  Jesse has to get a handle on the booze.  He needs to stop drinking for the most part and get his job back so Suitcase and Rose don't end up leaving town.  If they go, Paradise will be up the creek without a paddle.  Jesse also needs to get another telephone for the house so his friends can reach him and not die in the process.  In other words, Jesse needs to shape up and get his act together.  Everybody has problems, and the majority of people find a way of dealing with them so they can function in day-to-day society.

One last rant and then I'm done for the day.  The DVD of Innocents Lost doesn't have any extras on it.  Shame on the people who put the DVD together.  Why not some interviews with the cast and producers and writers?  Why not a look at the series versus the novels and why the series decided to branch off from the books?  Why not a ""Making Of"" featurette?  I think Stone Cold was the only one of the movies to have any extras at all.  If these DVDs are going to cost an arm and a leg when they come out, at least give the viewers something more than the movie to watch.

The stories are well written, and I love seeing police drama that doesn't depend on car chases and explosions, but rather gets into the characters.

Selleck should stick to acting and hire some good writers, some who can write dialogue. While they're at it throw in an interesting plot again. In particular this current installment has everyone talking in the same clipped two word responses. ""Do you do so and so?"" ""I do."" and ""Were you at so and so?"" ""I was."" and ""Are you a so and so?"" ""I am."" And that's it, end of sentence. This is OK for the Stone character but not for everyone in the story. Most people don't talk like this.

The Jesse Stone films are so well directed that they are over before you know it and leave you wanting more.  They are so quietly advanced that you are on the edge of your seat without realizing it.  The tiny details sink into the back of your mind and nag at you as the integral parts of the mystery that they are while you wait for the answers.  Get them ALL.  Then figure out the order they belong in versus the order in which they were televised.  You will want to watch them again and again.  Especially on a cold winter's night when you want to feel especially warm and cozy because someone else is out in the cold doing detective work.

I have recorded each of the other movies and now own three on DVD, soon I will own all seven.",1308009600,6,416,4.048780487804878
4453164,1,B004QOB8UC,"I feel Tom Selleck is a fabulous actor and I have very much enjoyed his Jesse Stone series, but as one reviewer said - this was not up to his standards....  Innocents Lost was a walk-through - too much talking, too many silent periods and unfortunately, I did not enjoy it!",1307145600,8,273,4.352941176470588
4453165,4,B004QOB8UC,"""Innocents Lost"" is the seventh installment in the Jesse Stone television movies starring Tom Selleck, set in the fictional town of Paradise, Massachusetts.  The movies are based on novels by Robert B. Parker.

As this movie opens, Jesse Stone has been forcibly retired as police chief of Paradise and is in search of some inner peace.  He experiments with jogging; talks with his psychiatrist (a returning William Devane); has an affair with a young woman who works at a car dealership; and commiserates with the members of the Paradise police department (Kathy Baker and Kohl Sudduth), who are suffering under the reign of a new, young and politically ambitious police chief.

The only thing that really seems to engage Jesse is the chance to do some police work.  He is asked to consult for the state on a homicide case that seems open and shut, but isn't.  Jesse uses his connections with the State Police to work a separate, private case.  This one involves the death of a young woman whom Jesse had attempted to assist in the past.  The clues lead Jesse to a private drug rehab facility for the wealthy, a doctor with political connections, and a Russian mobster with ruthless working habits.

Even by the deliberately paced standards of Jesse Stone movies, this is a meandering story.  Jesse Stone gets a lot of quiet time with his aging dog while wrestling with his drinking problem.  Each of the returning characters gets some screen time with Stone, and the moments of shocking violence we have come to expect are saved for the end.  The rather abrupt ending seems a setup for a sequel, reportedly already in the works.

""Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost"" is highly recommended to fans of the television movies.",1306800000,21,1716,4.815699658703072
4453166,1,B004QOB8UC,"Honestly. My wife and I have enjoyed the Jesse Stone series. Until now. When it was on CBS a couple of weeks ago, we sat down to watch it and after a half-hour of moody shots of Jesse's house, too many shots of that beautiful dog (whom we love), and one-too-many dialogue scenes that even Parker would have found embarrassing - we gave up.

Look, I've been a Parker fan for thirty years and I admit he was never the most complicated writer. His dialogue was his forte and those who don't like his writing says it's TOO lean and TOO sparse. That's as maybe, but Tom Selleck and crew were always good at delivering it. This time, no sale. Tom co-wrote this script, and he's just not Robert B. Parker. Time to let this series go.

For fans, go back and re-watch ""Stone Cold"" or ""Night Passage"" or ""Death in Paradise"" - the best ones in this series. And yes, we miss Viola Davis, too.",1306713600,15,880,4.295180722891566
4453167,4,B004QOB8UC,"I don't have a real review to pass on. However, there was a sequence problem in the film on TV which I hope will be corrected in the DVD release.  The scene in which Jesse went to the rehab place and asked the young man about the Russian--by name--was shown before the scene where the gangster tells Jesse about the Russian in the first place. Not a major problem, but a minor annoyance.",1306368000,11,387,4.301369863013699
4453168,5,B004QOB8UC,"Everything about this film is great. Tom Selleck is superb as Jesse Stone. The other actors in the movie are very good. The story has two plots. The State Police ask Stone's help in proving that a man is actually innocent of a crime. Stone is bothered when he learns that a girl he tried to help apparently commited suicide. Everyone tells him to leave the case alone. He is no longer the police chief. Yet as a white knight, he will not let up. The dialogue in the film copies the Robert B. Parker crisp style and is very good. However, Parker was able to add some humor to the dialogue, which is absent in this film.",1306281600,12,618,4.245762711864407
4453169,5,B004QOB8UC,"It was good to see CBS take the lead on airing this movie. In the Jesse Stone series, the late Robert Parker has created some very solid & believable characters.
The protagonist in this series, Jesse Stone, fights for law & order in a small town PD after being canned from the LAPD. He fights his demons of abusive drinking, loneliness, and sensitivity. In this installment he's also been canned from the small town of Paradise's PD. He's got a solid cast to back him up.
As Parker did an excellent job in creating this series, Tom Selleck does an excellent job of bringing Jesse Stone & his sensibilities to life.",1306108800,13,614,4.54054054054054
4453170,5,B004QOB8UC,"Dear Mr. Selleck:  I hope you never stop making the Jesse Stone movies for TV. Like you said, Jesse is a mess but he is a fascinating mess. I never tire of listening to the banter between characters, the simplistic yet intriguing plots and the strangely complicated relationship between this man and his dog.  I mean, who else but Jesse could have communication issues with a (depressed?) Golden Retriever?!  The ending to this particular show was really terrific otherwise I wouldn't have given it, literally, a thumb up and a chuckle. Death is but a few gurgles away for the bad guy, and Jesse's final words, if my recollection serves me correctly, were ""you're not going to get better."" Yup, that about sums it up...",1306108800,19,719,4.736
4453171,4,B004QOB8UC,"Fans of this serious deserve a medal for being the most patient fans on the planet.  Most fans have had to resort to DVD supplements (or the Hallmark Channel) to even catch all the installments.  Luckily places like Office Depot and big chain Grocery Stores carry most of the DVD's cheap.  CBS hasn't been very helpful, the first two episodes were aired in reverse order and the latest two episodes (parts 6 and 7) put on a shelf for over a year while negotiating with Tom Selleck to do the TV series BLUE BLOODS.  Part 6 ultimately aired with little fanfare in a terrible time slot and Part 7 finally found a decent home (and will be released on DVD August 2nd, probably).  Even if you were able to catch all of them on TV the time period between films was pretty lengthy to remember some of the plot points in the continuing story line.  The 6th film, SEA CHANGE, for example, the one that sat on the shelf and then given a bad time slot, brought back guest characters from all the previous episodes.  Nifty idea if you watch all the DVD's in a month, but not spread out over 3 years.  For the record in case you need to catch up, the story order of the DVD's (not the order they were aired or related to the book title order) are:
1. Night Passage
2. Stone Cold
3. Death in Paradise
4. Sea Change
5. Thin Ice
6. No Remorse
7. Innocents Lost.
So are they worth it?  Yes. They are character-driven moody dramas with just enough quirky moments to add some jokeless humor.  Jesse Stone is a cop and a drunk who goes from being an LAPD robbery-homicide detective to police chief of a small town in Massachusetts. He solves all the cold cases (unsolved crimes), including the grisly ones that no one in town even knew existed, merely as a way to pass the boredom. This actually upsets the status quo of townsfolk that would rather leave their not-so-peaceful past buried.  Story lines unexpectedly spill into sequel films making this a continuous story-line series.",1306108800,100,1962,4.4525139664804465
4453172,5,B004QOB8UC,"Tom Selleck IS Jesse Stone!  'Innocents Lost' brought the characters together and, I believe, more relaxed in their roles, like old shoes that finally fit after a few stretches of the leather.  Please, don't throw them away, because we want more Jesse Stone and Co.!  Joe the Dog steals the show!  Even he is beginning to show his age with a little graying around his muzzle.

The story is strong, subtle and makes you want more.  Stone, now retired, is still seeking justice for a crime that will, probably, never be solved.  The new Chief doesn't get much air-time, which is a good thing!  Rose's character is getting stronger, but still vulnerable.  She walks the line and delivers for Stone.  Suits is more settled and endearing.  Thankfully, for me, there is only one short phone call between 'the ex' and Jesse.  The ending is oustanding!

For anyone who has read much of the late Mr. Robert Parker, the speech patterns were his signature, used for all major characters in his books, i.e., Spencer, Randall and Stone.  It's quirky, but always seems to work...for me.

I will purchase 'Innocents Lost' as soon as it's available!",1306108800,133,1133,4.768041237113402
