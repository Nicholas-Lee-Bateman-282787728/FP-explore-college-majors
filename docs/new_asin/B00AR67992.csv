The choreography is achievable for any level.  Don't say you're not a dancer.  If you're having fun while moving, then you're a dancer....and Ilyse will get you to that place of sheer fun!",1358035200,,383,4.521739130434782
8556776,5,B00AR67992,"This workout is so much FUN and so doable, I was able to get everything down and keep it up with them, sure there are a couple of moves that I need to master better, specially during the Hip Hop portion, but all in all I did awesome, and by the end of each routine I was able to add my own flavor and all. The warm up move fast and is a little bit tricky, but I was able to catch on later, the cool down was pretty good too, a lot of ballet moves, it looked very graceful, there is also a bonus ""Dancer's Abs and Bootylicious Buns"" which is 5:30 min. long, again very graceful, challenging and it gets the job done in such short time, I love that it is choreographed to the beat as well. I loved the whole thing, the music is fantastic and Ilyse Baker (the instructor) is just so awesome to workout with, I hope she will come up with more workouts DVDs. You can check for previews on YouTube, to get an idea of the choreography.  If you love to dance and you are up for a nice challenge, you need to add this workout to your library! As Ilyse says..:  You will thank me later! ;-)",1468972800,,1080,3.9953703703703702

8556779,5,B00AR67992,"I love Ilyse Baker. Discovered her thru a Weight Watchers workout video (WW Ultimate Dance Party workout), and immediately looked to see what else she'd done. Sadly, this is the only one I found, but I ordered it right away, and I really do love it. It makes working out fun so you look forward to doing it rather than dreading it. That's a big deal...looking forward to exercise means you'll actually get it done. As much as I love it, it might not be for everyone. If you don't like the idea of learning choreography and want simple moves, stay away from this one.

There are three workouts on the DVD. They are all effective and time-efficient..you get a lot of bang for your workout buck. I have to say that the Sexy Broadway Jazz workout is my favorite. It's tricky to learn, but you'll get it with practice, and then it's a total blast. You feel like you're dancing in a Bob Fosse musical. The only issue I have with it (as well as with the other workout on the dvd, the hip-hop funk workout) is that most of the workout is instructional. You're learning as you go...and the pace is varied between slow demo/practice and full-speed bursts. So you're definitely working, but not quite as hard as at the end, when she does a full 5-minute, nonstop version of the routine. I would rather see a two-part DVD, where you learn the routine in one part and and have a full-length version where you're doing the routine the whole time at full speed in the second part. But this is still EXCELLENT, and you will definitely sweat and enjoy yourself. Be warned, though. The warm-up and cool-down segments are surprisingly fast paced. The first time I did the workout, I remember wondering if I'd somehow accidentally forwarded past the warm-up--because it's fast! And I sometimes cool down a bit more with stretching after her ""cool down"" just to make sure my heart-rate is back to normal.

The hip-hop funk workout is also fun and a great workout, but I prefer the Broadway jazz workout.

The five minute buns and abs workout is short and effective, so you can't do much better than that.

I just wish Ilyse had more workouts like this...I love the idea of using cool choreography and feeling like a dancer and getting a great workout at the same time. I know there's always Zumba, but I prefer the Broadway dance style and would love to see more workouts like this one.",1403222400,,2365,4.518691588785047
8556780,5,B00AR67992,I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THIS WORKOUT DVD. I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH ILYSE BAKER. I LIKE THE CREATIVE WAY IN WHICH SHE COMBINES MANY DANCE STYLES IN THE 2 WORKOUTS. SHE IS NOT OVERBEARING LIKE OTHER INSTRUCTORS & THAT MAKES FOR A PLEASANT & FUN DANCE WORKOUT!!!,1369872000,2,265,4.659574468085107
8556781,5,B00AR67992,"This dance DVD's is like having a party in your living room instead of working out, yet know you're getting your cardio. Even though your heart is pumping, it is not as high impact a workout as are the Tracy Anderson dance videos which have jumping jacks and leaps. The choreography is really fun and Ilyse's attitude is infectious. The DVD is broken up into two dance workouts, a Jazzy one, then a Hip-hop one. It also includes a short and tough abdominal mat segment can be used to round off the workout. As far as the dances go, Ilyse doesn't waste a lot of time with slow and repetitive breakdowns.  She demonstrates a block slowly three times, than proceeds to al tempo and continues adding blocks to the routine, again running through it slowly, then from the top, then al tempo till all the pieces run together. The last 5 minutes of each workout is spent just repeating the routine without stopping. I couldn't get it all on the first go-round, but by the 4th time, I'd picked it up and now am working on my style and flair. Warning: the Hip-hop dance is hard on your knees if you have carpeted floors as there are a lot of sliding lateral moves where the foot is dragged to create the style. Overall, this fun dance workout is not for someone who's had no introduction to dance, but is more for those who always find themselves on the dance floor at parties and can pick up steps easily. If you liked Jennifer Galardi's ""Sweating Sexy"" or Julianne's ""Just Dance"", this is for you.",1360540800,2,1489,4.454212454212454
8556782,5,B00AR67992,"I have no professional training, unless you count the one year I took ballet when I was four-years-old - I'm now 55, so it's been awhile. I can only tell you that if you've ever fantasized about being Beyonce's backup dancer but you know you that will never happen, you can definitely get that same experience from Ilyse Baker's DVD. She breaks down the steps and slowly adds more steps/moves until you are doing a dance routine. This isn't like dancing at a club or a party - this is a real workout and you will sweat but more importantly you will have fun. Don't be intimidated by some of the dance terminology Ilyse uses like Grapevine (which is a step) - I didn't know what that was until I watched her do it and then I did it. You will catch on and you will love, love, love it! The additional workouts on the DVD are tough and honestly I've done those twice, but I can't stop doing the dances and that's what I love the best.",1359504000,2,931,4.235955056179775
8556783,5,B00AR67992,"This DVD leaves you feeling invigorated and accomplished as if you conquered a challenge while getting an incredible workout. Ilyse's energy is infectious and her vibrant personality makes you want to bust out her ingeniously choreographed dance moves.  The routine is broken down into fun easy steps and you are performing like a professional dancer before you know it with sweat pouring down. The ""open the door"" movement is my favorite and I find myself doing it at random times. Dancinerate Burn With The Beat is like nothing else I've ever seen and highly recommend it.",1358467200,,574,4.979166666666667
8556784,5,B00AR67992,"Let me say I do not like working out, but this DVD is fun and I don't really realize I am exercising.  I think my dancing might just get better too.  The best part is that my daughter and her friend look forward to dancing too so now working out can be for everyone. The routines are challenging but not impossible and fun for everyone.  The 5 min ab workout at the end will be an everyday occurence, I mean it is only 5 min and more than i am doing now.",1358208000,2,454,3.9130434782608696
8556785,5,B00AR67992,"This video makes you want to dance, and makes you want to watch it and do it again and again!  Ilyse's unique but clear choreography makes you want to dance, dance, dance through the entire video...and do it every day.  I love it, and I am in my forties...and my teenagers...who could not be more different...love it as well.  My dancer daughter loves it, as does my hockey player...that's how doable it is!!!!  If you cannot take class with Ilyse in LA...this is the next best thing.  I cannot wait for her next video!",1358035200,,519,4.4787234042553195
