3116036,3,B0013KXZ4O,In all fairness to the product I can't really evaluate this.  It was bought for my husband and he passed away before he was able to get into it.  Sorry.,1419724800,,152,4.033333333333333

3116040,1,B0013KXZ4O,"The instructor took too much time explaining tuning using a device that was too expensive for most musicians. He also explained an 8 string lap steel when I needed a 6 string instruction book.
There are far too many different tuning options for steel guitar and they were not explained well enough for me.",1387152000,7,305,4.666666666666667

A good place to start when one wishes to undertake this style (steel lap - acoustic, or steel petal) which seems to be gaining in  popularity.",1364774400,,314,4.90566037735849
3116042,5,B0013KXZ4O,"This DVD does have some product suggestions at the beginning as has been mentioned in other reviews. However I found his descriptions of suitable instruments and equipment to be very useful. Rob goes into a lot of detail about guitar cables that he uses and I took his advise and bought the cables and as he had said,they are great cables at a reasonable price. If you listen to Rob during the video,he states that just starting out playing you can use any equipment you already have or can afford. I found his instruction to be very clear and easy to follow. I'm not a beginning musician,so I clearly have an advantage over somebody not knowing anything at all about music,but I think that the real value of this DVD is the technique you learn for the instrument and what equipment you'll need to play in a professional setting. I also have the DVD set from Cindy Cashdollar that will compliment this DVD quite well. Cindy goes into bar slants more that Rob does,but Rob covers bars,pedals,strings,cables,and picks more that Cindy. If you want to learn to play lap steel I suggest you get all 3 DVDs and an 8 string C6 lap steel. The one I eventually bought was a Morrell which I'm quite happy with,but look forward to owning the Sierra. Hope I was of help to somebody wanting to learn.

3116043,2,B0013KXZ4O,"The description for this DVD says, ""Anyone Can Play C6 Lap Steel Guitar is designed for the absolute lap steel beginner"". While this is a nice DVD to watch to see some good, closeup Lap Steel work, it is NOT a proper DVD for a beginning player.

I've ran a specialty music store for over 10 years now, so I've seen a lot of tutorials, DVDs, etc. I would not consider this a tutor for a beginning player at all - the first 40 minutes of the DVD is nothing more than endorsements for the equipment that Rob Haines uses (if you purchase the equipment that he endorses, you'll end up spending over $3,000.00 to get started...). He plays an eight-string lap steel, and mentions that you can use this DVD for learning on a six-string also - but throughout the DVD he uses all eight strings when playing, not giving any suggestions for adjusting to six strings. I don't see how this DVD can be of any real use to a beginning player with a six-string instrument.

After the endless endorsements at the beginning of the DVD, he goes straight into music theory, and fairly advanced playing. There is virtually no practical beginner's material at all. This would have been a much better beginner's DVD if it included even a few basic tunes, along with sheet music (and/or tab).

By the end of the DVD, I found myself wondering if anyone at Mel Bay actually watched it before writing/approving the title and description...",1249948800,86,1410,4.543307086614173

Since I'm a beginner, I didn't find it all that helpful, but the author did explain some things that would be true about either.",1501545600,2,301,3.918032786885246
8251636,5,B0013KXZ4O,"Great instrumental DVD. No tab is necessary. Rob Haines clearly explains everything from A-Z about learning the 8 string lap steel. Audio and visual are perfect. He covers everything from the right type of stings, C6 tuning, amps, bar technique, chords, all the necessary equipment like the volume pedal, a 3 1/2"" x 7/8"" steel bar, available at Amazon, fingerpicks and how to alter them. I am waiting for the bar and the picks. I've been messing with lap slide for a long time, so it should be easy for me to adapt, but total beginners may need something more basic, like 6 string lap book. Lots of country licks, scales, bar slants, sliding technique, chord blocking. chord progressions, uses diagrams, volume pedal technique, how to get the best sound, etc. This is the best on the market. Totally happy. The instructor also shares many relevant links. My goal is to get a job playing lap steel in one year. lol",1494806400,,913,4.6770186335403725
