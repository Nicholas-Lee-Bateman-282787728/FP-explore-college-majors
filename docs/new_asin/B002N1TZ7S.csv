I think all the aforementioned makes this documentary something worth checking out.  At present, this seems to be the only program on this topic, not counting news segments.

The production values were less than desirable but not completely atrocious.  I also think the program flow was good enough because in the end I had a good idea of what the former players, from the 90's as well as the 60's, thuoght of their predicaments.

I don't know if it was possible, but the producers should have studied the various different hits that NFL players semm to be taking.

For example, kick/punt return collisions, receiver over the middle crunch hits, QB blind-side hit, RB (and especially FB), CB and safeties making hits and bumping helmets while doing so, puposely ramming crown of helmet into other players ear hole area, interior linemen being bent over backward unnaturaly causing twisting of leg bones/joints.

I think a close look at all, or some, of these would help those who haven't played pro ball understand this whole subject much better.

It should be noted that this program plays on the viewers emotions instead of making a rational argument about who should be coughing up the money to care for these retired players.  I remember a segment on TV just a few years ago about disabled NFL players, this very subject.  I'm no Roger Goodell fan, but he made a good point (paraprashed slightly) ""60 percent of NFL revenues already go to the players, I can't see how it can/could be any higher.""  He seemed to be implying that it was the current players responsibility to take care of retired veterans, not the current owners.

As to the general subject matter itself, honestly, these players either did know, or didn't bother to find out, what the league owners were obligated to do for them, pre and post retirement.  They voted for Gene Upshaw, meaning they could've unvoted him out of his leadership position of the NFLPA.  I've heard/read he didn't care about current players either.  If they would just act in concert, maybe some/lot of this would not occur.  Won't know that, sitting back, doing nothing.

One impression I get from this program is that the players and owners are in contracts that have much subjectivity.  And this is what allows the players to be treated the way they are.

I know the owners have lawyers to craft the contract language, but the players, if they would act unified, could hire a lawyer to tell them exactly what can/cannot happen to them later in retirement.

I do agree, from what I have seen/heard of NFL owners, that  they will shaft a player at the drop of a hat.  I understand they are cut-throat and cold-blooded toward employees (players).  But the things the players could do, i.e. vote for union rep. or learn the P's and Q's of what players are entitled to, they don't seem to care much about.  I was told, at age 17, as a new private in the Army, by a grizzled, ole, silvery haired First Sergeant, ""mister, you look after yourself, don't trust no one else to do it for you, or you will be sorry one day"".  That is a great Life's lesson.",1354838400,2,3332,4.672384219554031
8374548,3,B002N1TZ7S,"The best aspect of Blood Equity is the narratives from the retired players. Their stories are compelling, and saddening. It is through their stories that you understand the problems and frustration facing retired players and their families. However, the film seems to have been put together in a rather haphazard manner. In places it is over produced (overly dramatic music, or loud sounds - think ""True Hollywood Stories"" on crack) and poorly edited. The film comes across as an amateur production and I personally found this distracting and irritating from, what is, interesting subject matter. Perhaps a low point of the film is when a player is introduced with the graphic indicated that he played for the ""Dever Broncos"". This is quite sad because the issues this film raises are very important and these retired players should be supported. I would have liked more information regarding the NFLPA's stance and the CBAs that led to this problem. A historical perspective would have made this film much better. Also, the flow of the film does not progress in a logical fashion. Instead, it appears the film makers have taken a collection of interviews, chopped them up, and then arranged them in an arbitrary manner. While these criticism may seem harsh I do believe the film works best when the film makers just let the players talk. Their stories, delivered in their own words, are quite powerful.",1261785600,2,1403,4.974468085106383
