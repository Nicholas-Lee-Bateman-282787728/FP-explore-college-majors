6988879,5,B00SJFG6L0,"I've been recently wanting to expand my Blu-Ray collection and the Blade films were on my list. So after searching on Amazon, I found out there has never been a proper or acceptable Blu-Ray release of any of the films. According to the customer reviews, the single film Blu-ray versions were bad releases and the one and only Blade Collection on Amazon is a mess. The box is in French, apparently there are no menus, no subtitles, no bonus features and the picture quality is appalling.

Well I pre-ordered this set with the hopes that Warner Bros. finally did the Blade franchise justice with a proper release.
And I can say they nailed it!

So upon opening the case, I was greeted with 3 individual discs. On the left side, Blade, then on the right side on the same spiral holder, Blade II and Blade Trinity.

No other inserts, just the discs and the case. Thats it.

I can also quickly say each disc has been nicely fitted with Special Features!
Blade II most especially has over 2 HOURS of special features!

And all 3 films feature subtitles. :)
Blade I features English, Castilian Spanish, Latino Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Czech and Russian subtitles.
Blade II features English, German, Latino Spanish, Portuguese, Czech, Russian and Hungarian subtitles.
Blade Trinity features English, German, Spanish and Czech subtitles.

But first, onto the audio and video quality! And I can say overall, AMAZING job Warner Bros/New Line!

6988903,3,B00SJFG6L0,Pick one and the other two are about the same. Watchable but predictable. Blade character was a little too cool for me as his character in the comics wasn't that way.

6988922,4,B00SJFG6L0,"First 2 movies are pretty great if you enjoy action or vampire films. I'm not a fan of the 3rd film other then Ryan Reynolds being in it as Hannibal King.

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the packaging could be better. There are only 2 spots for 3 discs so they just stacked Blade 2 and Blade Trinity onto each other. I'm sure they did that to cut costs instead of adding an insert but it comes across as being lazy. That being said the set itself was priced very low so I won't gripe too much.",1511308800,2,517,3.9711538461538463
6988923,4,B00SJFG6L0,"Let me start off by saying, Blade is the reason why Marvel superheroes have made it to the big screen. I remember going to see the first Blade movie in 1998 and it started the Marvel revolution to the big screen, as it was the very first Marvel film to draw big and gain box office success. Wesley, Kris, Stephen, Donal, and N Bushe all did a great job in the movie.

The second Blade movie was released in 2002, and it introduced a new Vampire breed. As Nomak becomes Blade's rival in this movie. Still enough gore and action to make me say this is the second best Blade movie.

The third Blade movie is was and always will be a disaster. No chemistry, the acting is corny and cheesy especially from Ryan Reynolds and Triple H. Whistler was killed off, Wesley looked disinterested. There was so many things wrong with this movie its laughable. Only watch it to get a laugh THATS IT.",1511136000,,883,4.345454545454546
6988924,4,B00SJFG6L0,I have always enjoyed the trilogy which is why i bought the book set. Too bad I only rcv'd 2 or the 3 disks. Just wasn't worth trying to get the one I missed from the set. I bought it separately.,1509321600,,195,3.7804878048780486
6988925,5,B00SJFG6L0,You can't beat this set for the price. The first 2 are pretty great however the 3rd movie was absolutely ruined by director Goyer taking over. He seemed to forget what he had going.  This killed the series.,1508284800,,206,4.421052631578948

6988980,3,B00SJFG6L0,"After receiving the Blade trilogy set, I immediately transferred the disc set into a dedicated 3 disc blu-ray case. I hate the way some producers ( I guess saving money) stack disc on top of one another. Stacking the disc risk damaging the disc trying to remove them from their designed case.
  On that matter i give the movie case and theory a three stars. The movies I would give 5 stars on action and having a plausible plot.

6989020,2,B00SJFG6L0,I do like the blade movies but the Blu-ray transfer looks like crap on this Blu-ray set. And on Blade Trinity you get the unrated version with I did not care for I found it slow moving compared to the theatrical version. With is more fast passed. And you do not get the  theatrical version of Blade Trinity on this Blu-ray set.  I liked the theatrical version of Blade Trinity  better then the unrated one.,1475971200,4,406,4.386666666666667
6989021,4,B00SJFG6L0,"This is definitely the cheapest and easiest way to get all three films in the popular late-90's/early-2000's action series ""Blade"" on Blu-Ray.  For about $10, you're getting all three films (""Blade"", ""Blade II"", ""Blade: Trinity"") loaded with Special Features in a single package, with the nice High Definition visual upgrade that the Blu-Ray format promises.

The films of course revolve around half-human/half-vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes), as he stalks the night hunting and killing vampires.  In the original, he is pulled into a twisted game against a vampire named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who seeks to resurrect an ancient Vampire God to take over the world.  In the second film, Blade must team up with his enemies (a group of vampires including Ron Perlman and Donnie Yen) to face a much larger threat.  And in the third film, Blade teams up with a team of hot-headed young slayers (including Ryan Reynolds of ""Deadpool"" fame) to fight Dracula (Dominic Purcell)- the original vampire.

The three films quality is varied depending on personal taste, but I always found all three quite entertaining.  Heck, even though part three is a bit wonky and suffered from obvious production troubles, I still kinda like it.  Though the second has always been my personal favorite.

The set comes in a very basic case with each movie on its own separate disc.  To answer the important questions:
-Yes, this does come with both the Theatrical and Unrated versions of ""Blade: Trinity""
-And yes, it seems to include most (if not all) previously released Special Features from the prior DVD releases.

So, $10 for one wickedly bad-a** trilogy with tons of bonus content seems like a perfect bargain, right?  And it should easily be a perfect 5 out of 5, right?

Well, sadly no, as I do have to dock a point for a fairly major complaint, which is the case.  It's extremely cheap and ""Blade II""/""Blade: Trinity"" are literally stacked on top of one-another tightly, which does cause a bit of worry for me.  It just seems like it's asking for the discs to pick up light scratches over time.  In addition, the packaging itself is quite cheap, which bugged me.  Yes, I know this is more of one of those ""budget releases"" that are popular to sell in stores like Wal-Mart or Target...  but a little more effort would have been appreciated.

Still, if you're a fan looking for an upgrade on your ""Blade"" DVD's, this is a great set.  And my problems with the packaging aside, it's well-worth the $10 price tag.",1473465600,2,2496,4.814553990610329

6989109,5,B00SJFG6L0,Really fun collection. Blade 1 has the tightest story while Blade's icy demeanor gets no better than here. Blade 2 has the coolest look with Nomak and his tribe vs Blade and the Blood Pack. Blade 3 is the weakest of the bunch but the final battle is really good and the jokes during it are the best in the film.,1456790400,,311,4.114754098360656

6989114,5,B00SJFG6L0,"Blade: This is a great movie that tells you the story of Blade, half human, half vampire. It goes into depth about what his crusade is and what he is all about. This movie has a great cast a lot of people that you'll remember from anything you've seen in the past 5-10 years. The story talks of a Blood God and Blade being the only one who can save humanity. If you like martial arts and sword fighting, you'll like this.

Blade 2: This wasn't a great sequel to the original Blade movie. We deal with a new type of vampires and vampires hunting this new type along side Blade. Daryl Dixon from The Walking Dead is in it lol. Honestly the story line for this movie leaves you wanting more. Nothing more than a wild goose chase for one person only to find out.....(zero spoilers here).

Blade Trinity: This movie ended the series on a bad note. Yes, this movie had Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds in it but, yet another story line that just wasn't great story line. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie and I would watch it again I just didn't like how the movie went. I think there was a lot left out. As you may or may not know Blade is a Marvel hero. So what I'm thinking is, they took part of a story arc from a comic and tried to make it into a movie. This was good and bad. Good because they may have pulled some comic book fans into watching the movie. Bad, because they left out a lot from the first two movies and probably some from the comic book. Overall this series deserves a reboot. I look forward to someone doing a reboot.",1453766400,,1536,4.151006711409396

Blade 2-  The  long  awaited  sequel directed  by  Guillermo del Toro  who  wanted  to  direct  some  of  my  favorite  movies  like  the  ""Hell boy"" films  and  ""Pacific Rim""  and  he  did  a  fantastic  job  balancing  the horror  and  action  elements  there  are  also  some  great  comedic  moments  as  well  great  sequel  to a  great  movie.

Blade  Trinity- What  happened?  two  great  movies  and  one  really  bad  one  and  Blade  isn't even  the  main  character  in  his  own  movie!  instead  it  focuses  on  the  absolutely dull duo  of Jessica beil  and  Ryan  Reynolds (  one  of  whom  went  to  star  in  a  few  god awful comic book films of  his  own.)  now  while  this movie  is  awful  their are  some  good  things  about  it.

The one that some of us may have ordered having given up on a proper American based release.

I pre-ordered this Warner Bros. release since all indicators were that the aspect ratios were going to be corrected. And if they were going to do that, it was my best case scenario hope that the audio would be fine as well. Was it worth the gamble? By gosh....  THIS is THE blu-ray BLADE TRILOGY that you have been waiting for - at any price (and this happens to be a very, very good price)!

While the packaging leaves a bit to be desired (never did like stacking discs), it doesn't matter. Why? Because that ""other"" Blade Trilogy came with 3 individual cases in a box set! Guess who swapped out discs? :)

If you love the Blade Trilogy and have given up on a quality blu-ray release....  you will be highly pleased with this set!!!",1426032000,25,1066,4.441025641025641

Thats the only reason for 4 out of 5. Also, Trinity sucks but we all know that!",1529798400,,260,3.9245283018867925
