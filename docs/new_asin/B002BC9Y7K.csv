8656145,1,B002BC9Y7K,"An unrealistic movie.  I've been a criminal lawyer for 41 years. And  I have never even heard of any psychopath doing anything like that portrayed in this movie, especially where a good guy was a hero. If something like that happened in real life,  chances are very likely the good guy would been killed.

And the movie was difficult to follow. Nothing was explained.

I only bought the movie because of  underrated British actress,  Claire Keelan, who only had a small role in the movie. I'm sorry I bought it.

Despite everything I have said, knowing people like different kinds of movies, I can understand that somebody might enjoy the movie.",1438905600,2,645,4.747747747747748

8656149,5,B002BC9Y7K,watched on a whim and was surprised.  the movie is full of suspense and had a satisfying ending.  zakes and his girlfriend are driving down the road while arguing.  their relationship is on the skids.  a white truck gets ahead of them and zakes sees a nude girl in the back screaming.  zakes notifies the police but his girlfriend insists more be done to aid the female.  due to a surprising turn of events zakes ends up in pursuit of the truck driver.  zakes as our hero makes a few errors in judgments but overall handles the situations with more realism than seen in most movies.  i really enjoyed the villianous truck driver.  his face is never shown nor does the viewer hear him speak.  it is obvious why the driver is kidnapping girls especially when the viewer get to see the driver's compound and also the title of the book at the end.  overall very well made movie with solid plot and smart acting.,1315699200,4,907,4.4363636363636365
8656150,5,B002BC9Y7K,This is one of my top favorite movies of all time. I just like how this movie unfolds and keeps you in suspence! I'm gonna have to buy this Dvd as soon as possible! Excellent movie on dvd!,1303862400,2,188,3.973684210526316
8656151,4,B002BC9Y7K,"As the title states, I was pleasantly surprised by this film and equally impressed with the hero, Zakes.  Despite being labelled a slacker by his girlfriend, Zakes rose to the occasion when she was kidnapped by a psychopath.  I couldn't help but cheer him on his mission, even though their relationship had hit the skids.  His putting himself into a dangerous situation was proof of his love for her.  Only if we all had someone like that.  I also thought Zakes handling of situations were realistic and very smart.  He used his brain and intuition when faced with challenges.  I look forward to more work by this director and the lead actor, William Ash.  I didn't need an explanation why the guy in the truck was kidnapping these women.  Why overstate the obvious?  Films sometimes trip themselves up when trying to ""explain"" everything.  It really wasn't about the psychopath.  It was about one man's journey to save the woman he loves.  The film succeeds because of  the likeability and resilience of the hero.  I could have done without the ending that hinted at a sequel.  I wish the filmmaker would have quit while he was ahead.  Do we always need an open ""ending""?  It's a genuinely taut thriller and I recommend it!",1287273600,6,1224,4.693396226415095
