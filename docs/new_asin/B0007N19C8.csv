8049117,1,B0007N19C8,"Grossly under reports Iraqi murders, 40,000?  Try nearly 2 million.  I grew up reading NG magazine but they have since lost all respect from myself and those who know better.",1402876800,,174,4.766666666666667
8049118,5,B0007N19C8,"In the program ""Warship,"" we meet a group of Marines training
aboard the USS Tarawa anchored off San Diego. Marines don't
usually open up about their feelings, but here those with
something to say are pretty positive about life in the military.
""What makes me good at what I do is the support I have from my
teammates,"" says an eight year veteran.
""Everybody knows what has to be done to work together and
in sync."" says another. ""I enjoy what I'm doing. It's a labor
of love.""
Here are young men and women who would rather dare something
great than join rank with those who sit and watch life go
by. So why do we worry so about them? They're where they
want to be doing what they want to do and many will
re-enlist and re-enlist again. Far more lives are lost
every year in traffic accidents than in war. Last year alone
50,000 were lost in traffic accidents. If this figure is
correct, their chances of getting home safe are better
than ours.",1390262400,,944,4.369318181818182
8049119,5,B0007N19C8,"Inside Shock and Awe is excellent. It describes the ""plan of attack"" with lightning speed and overwhelming force used and it's desired effect.",1229731200,,142,5.217391304347826
8049120,5,B0007N19C8,"This film was awesome. Great footage of what lead to Shock And Awe, what happened during Shock And Awe, and the after effects of Shock And Awe.
They take you inside buildings that are standing and look perfectly fine only to see the insides completely gutted. This shows the amazing precision of the USA's military.",1216857600,3,315,4.745454545454545
8049121,5,B0007N19C8,"The other reviewer clearly has not watched the DVD. Probably one of those Know-Nothing,Pro-: Rape-Room/Beheading/Stoning2Death/Limb-Severing/MassGrave-Filling/Kurd-Gassing/UN-Corrupting Saddam Hussein Regime, Anti-American, Anti-U.S. Military activists, who would prefer that you think of them as ""peace"" or ""anti-war"" activists. What the ""Shock and Awe"" DVD shows us is the amazing and humbling power and precision of America's armed forces. The Republican Palace is hit time and time again, pounded over and over again in stunning displays of American firepower. Yet once all is said and done, it is clear that the bombings were so accurate, so precise, that the building was absolutely gutted inside, but from the outside, it simply looks like they had a fire; just a bit of blackened stone by the windows. Nothing outside is disturbed to any degree. A rabid chipmunk would have been far more dangerous to innocent Iraqi civilians than American bombers.

Not only are the bombs themselves, the delivery systems, and the war planning involved all designed to MINIMIZE innocent civlilian casualties, but in fact, according to the best information available to the United States of America, the entire war from 2003 to this moment has only cost approximately 30,000 TOTAL IRAQI CASUALTIES. This includes many groups of human casualties, from regular ba'athist army units, Republican Guart units, insurgents, and domestic Iraqi terrorists to innocent civilians. Considering how amazingly precise and efficient the U.S. Military is, the vast majority of those deaths and injuries consist of those who were fighting against the amazing American Military machine. Ten to twenty thousand Saddam-era Iraqi troops were killed in the initial combat stages. Several thousand have been killed fighting against American and new Iraqi forces, and I would imagine the vast majority of innocent civilians were put in harm's way purposely by pro-Saddam Ba'athist insurgents, terrorists, and religious militias. Very few innocent civilians have actually been killed by American forces.

The display of firepower contained herein is second to none. If you ever wished you had some of the amazing footage from the Shock and Awe, along with a lengthy discussion about the planning and the campaign in general, with many interviews and an obviously large amount of research, then this DVD is for you. Enjoy!",1135555200,20,2387,5.51912568306011
8049122,2,B0007N19C8,Offers no insight on the iraqui side as to what actually went on during and after the operation. No information about iraqui casualties or how Saddam's regime was affected. No information about the targets struck. Interviews to fighters and leaders on the iraqui side would have helped. It is just propaganda on how incredible the weapons are and the damage they could inflict.,1134432000,11,377,5.0
