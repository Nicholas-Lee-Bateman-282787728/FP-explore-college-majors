3884086,5,B002AFX53C,"I saw this film about 12 years ago in San Francisco at the Castro Theater I don't believe the entire payoff of the film is in its ending.  The detail and excruciating time experienced in this film follows you outside of your experience of watching it - I have never experienced a film that you had to completely surrender to and then leave feeling still so completely in its grasp and shape of time.  The experience on DVD is different - as you can break away at any time, wander in and out, but I suggest the first time you watch this film turn off the lights, and just surrender to living Jeanne's life.",1258848000,5,605,4.298245614035087
3884087,4,B002AFX53C,"I was curious about this film based on the reviews here and wanted to find out what is so different about it.  And yes, it is different.  It's not revolutionary, however.  German filmmakers like Wim Wenders R.W. Fassbinder and many, if not most important Japanese film directors have felt at ease with a slower in-the-course-of-time pace. And if you're not familiar with this film, that's what most are talking about.

When the protagonist makes dinner, we watch her make dinner, start to finish. When she washes the dishes, we see every plate and cup washed and put in the rack. Her elevator rides are pretty much in real time too. So if it takes a minute or two to get from point a to point b, the viewer experiences that with the protagonist. The camera doesn't cut away from these mundane actions, and they are observed silently; no inner monologue or narrative. And most of the time the action is static, with a single camera angle. No close ups of hands or dishes or pieces of meat. There are no tight shots that overtly call out objects as symbolic symbols.  It's all distantly observed.

For the bulk of this film, her sexual liaisons are not shown. Whereas most films (including foreign and art films) present story as a series of events that form a meaning out of the ""big events"" that occur in life, and saying ""this is what life is like,""  this film seems to be saying that this, with all its mundane aspects, is what life is like too. We just choose to dismiss the uneventful parts of our lives as not pertinent to the whole of our lives.

And while this film is not Groundhog Day, it perhaps succeeds at underscoring the fact that, for many, life is pretty much the same day repeated again and again. But there is a growing sense of desperation.  You feel it more in the last part of the film. And the film is not devoid of ""story."" There are scenes of interaction between the woman and her son that reveal much and are interesting to watch.

I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this film, however, and I'm not exactly championing it here, but I did watch from beginning to end, and with interest. I feel like I should get a t-shirt or or something for sitting through it, however. It's an unusual film and takes some effort to watch. So, while I'm still on the fence about this one, I do think it succeeds in what I think it's attempting to evoke.  But ... what do I know?",1254355200,16,2384,4.432494279176201
3884088,3,B002AFX53C,"I can't decide whether I've just sat through an historically significant film or a historically significant mistake.  And the film I rented had NO commentary or extras, so I've had to read past reviews just to try to get a bit of the perspectives of others.  Boy, is it ever LONG!  And boy, was the event at the end surprising!  In between, the hours dragged and opinions and questions about the non-existent plot became much more interesting than being caught up in the (non) action.  Wish I could decide whether it deals with feminism or with nihilism of some sort.  I hadn't known of the actress before, but she was RIGHT for the part, and so was the actor who did the son, and, indeed, the others too.

3884089,2,B002AFX53C,"I don't know what you guys are smoking but where can I get some? the really strange thing is that you are serious- what chances did this film maker take? a 3 hour boring film would find an audience, OK but from what I've seen it is an extremely limited group-why are slow an unpenitrable strengths? those are weakness in an art form not stregths- Appreciate the climax? I knew it was going to happen after 30 minutes. What is pure what is pesonal about any of this film, its is completely without guts, feeling or perspective, point of view, - there is no epiphany for the viewer, no arrest, no stopping to wonder to admire - relentlessly boring and should have been doomed to obscurity nothing of value except the high concept which is a 30 minutes film at best- not the shots not the acting not the script not what is said, really nothing. is that the point? I honestly thought at the end of the film, OK now she is gong to have a real life... but it ends- I have already forgotten this film, but  will never pay more that a rental fee to see this directors work again- I have seen some of her other shorts  and in the short form, 10 minutes MAX, the rather trite idea of the 70/80's of framing the everyday, ""experiencing"" time is communicated in all its banality with far less wasted time

the comment about high points in cinema history is not just delusional, it is hilarious, it is actual the bottom of drama and as such will have an avid, but limited following, one of kind alright - thank goodness. I love films from all countires and types and I am just shocked that this one ever got made- I suppose there is an audience for all tastes or as WC Fields said ""there is a sucker born every minute"". it is perhaps one of worst 5 films I have ever seen. this is not an art film, as that debases the word and form- this is at best an experimental film that works if you want to be bored for 3 hours, but on any other dramatic level is a failure.

I don't understand why Criterion would want this film in their library, why all the excitement and why this film is well thought of? I enjoy experimental films from all cultures, am not dependent on just plot, story, usually don't like most blockbuster films, can appreciate, if not always embrace, obscurity and abstraction, if it points to something and do not have to have  clear""meaning"" ...but what is the attraction here? This film is made for the FF button- it is over 3.5 hours long of how this women's life is completely boring, perhaps this would make sense if it were 30 minutes long but why does the audience have to be bored to sleep to understand her boredom. although she takes her johns in the afternoon and then in the last 5 minutes she snaps. What do you expect? What is learned? Why is this a ""feminist film""? because the victim is a male? because the director and star are female? THAT is not enough to make this a feminist film, is it.... the film is tedious, intentionally- boring, intentionally- so why is this considered art and not just another slow French ""experimental"" film, of which there are many, like every culture.  why is this film ground breaking or even art and not just a experiment in film and time? to sit through 3 hours of real time boiling potatoes is NOT art- there is nothing here that interested me or raised my awareness, no epiphany- just plain 3 hours of a middle class women making ends meet, cooking 30min, washing herself 10 min., shopping 15 mintues etc etc. I have maybe walked out on 5 films in my life but if I had watched this in a theatre, I'm afraid I would have left. if you must- RENT THIS FRIST

foot note:
I am always interested in art that I dislike as well as like, as both are keys to understanding one's psyche. So I studied JA's works in long form theatricals [Im afraid the two films I viewed were also lacking in drama and flops - La captive and room 666] and some of the reviewers/comments by smart folks who wrote whole books on her and style. Out of respect for those who have spent time dissecting her work and enjoyed her work I raised my star 1 rating. However, this idea of the incredible drama of ""nothing happening"" is beyond my ken. It is NOT ""new wave"" cinema, it is not drama as the Greek tragedies or Shakespeare or Neil Simone are but an ""experiment"" and I fear that those who rant about this film are intellectually elitist and/or have such little real passion in their lives that any art that extends time or magnifies the emptiness of contemporary life becomes not an experimental art film will be raved about and transformed into an art form.  I'm not bored to tears and don't need any art to reveal that a lack of passion in your life will create problems or make you ""snap"". clearly, if we don't have passion we make it or fake it. In any case, this is not my cup of tea and the reason its so unique is not because of its structure or ""form"" as people have been making boring movies for a long time, but because it's ""intentionally"" dull and boring. And fro some reason that intention is what excites people- then again its just my opinion.....",1252886400,17,5086,4.340694006309148
3884090,5,B002AFX53C,"As others have mentioned, this is a film unlike any ever made. Not only is it utterly original and distinctive, it took chances that filmmakers just don't take anymore - and it succeeded. The audience for Jeanne Dielman is certainly small. Most viewers would find this film slow and impenetrable, yet those are its strengths. Only through experiencing nearly every moment of Jeanne's life over several days does the viewer absorb the full impact of the film and appreciate its climax. I've never seen such a pure, personal vision of film created so successfully and I have no doubt that when people discuss 20th century filmmaking in several hundred years, this film will be a part of that discussion. If you sit through all 3 hours and follow it closely, you'll never forget this film, even if you think you don't like it. For me, it's one of the high points in cinema history and more than any other film ever made, it stands alone, sui generis - one of a kind. And, everyone who loves the movies is better off because of it.
And, for those who don't ""get"" this film, fear not: the next Adam Sandler movie and Saw IX will be coming to a multiplex near you, soon.",1246838400,48,1164,4.521327014218009
3884091,5,B002AFX53C,"How great that Criterion is releasing this masterpiece! It's really impossible to describe this film. I saw it back in the eighties and since then have tried to explain to friends the techniques that Chantal Ackerman uses to tell her tale. Most shake their heads and wonder why someone would want to watch repetitive static shots of real-time, full-length, unedited actions of the main characters doing things like peeling and boiling potatoes, making coffee, making meatloaf, etc. The film has the pace of a Tarkovsky film (but without the pretentiousness), and it sounds as if it would be incredibly boring. At 200 minutes it will test you (especially if you aren't used to ""art-house cinema""), but it works so well that you will be riveted by the smallest details and gestures. The action comes together (hint: or comes apart) perfectly, and it all makes sense in the (infamous) end. Throughout, you will find yourself joyously perplexed. There's humor and drama and perfectly scaled lulls and crescendos.

This is courageous and bold film making.

I saw the film again several months ago at SF MoMA, and the pure genius of it is undiminished. It is not dated, nor is it pretentious or overly artsy in its approach. I managed to drag along one of those friends who hadn't seen the film back in the eighties, and he was blown away. When the film ended, he turned to me and said, ""Incredible"" .",1245196800,25,1395,4.784232365145228
3884092,5,B002AFX53C,"I saw this film at the Film Forum in NYC in ~ 1982. IT BLEW ME AWAY. It was a mesmerising experience that I will never forget, and I am so glad that it is being released by The Criterion Collection.
The movie is long, and seems to move slowly, as some scenes are filmed in real time. The payoff comes at the end, when in a startling ending everything makes sense. A riveting film that you will think about for the rest of your life.",1245024000,16,432,4.034883720930233

3884095,2,B002AFX53C,"I went into this with an open mind.  I've no problem with 'slow' film and can really appreciate subtle details.  I happen to like a lot of Asian film which can be very slow and subtle...movies like Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter or Onibaba, When a Woman Ascends the Stairs, etc.  So my problem with this film was not that it was slow or had little 'action'.  I just didn't 'get' the point of the painstakingly long scenes.

I  also couldn't help but be bothered by the relationship between the mother and son.  She seemed to baby him too much and he for his part seemed rather 'insipid' and unappreciative and utterly boring.  I get that most boys his age probably don't have much to say, and parents know this.  But then why didn't the mother make more effort to engage him in conversation, as most parents would do?  I had a problem with the fact that she even helped him put his coat on/off.

We never saw the mom really interact with any other family or friends.  Not sure why that was.  Are we led to believe she simply has no other family or friends, and  if so why (beyond the one aunt who sent them a letter in the mail).

The constantly flashing light outside their dining/living room.  I'm sure that was calculated by the director...a way to add a certain underlying mood or sleaziness/depression to the film.  We never do know where that llight is coming from...what type of establishment is across the street from the apartment.

In any case, this film simply did 'nothing'  for me.",1457481600,11,1492,4.479553903345725
3884096,5,B002AFX53C,"This is a remarkable experimental film, shot with a fixed camera and dull tones that perfectly reflect the crushingly slow rhythm of a life.  Jeanne is a widow and prostitute, bringing up a son with whom she has a strange and empty relationship.  Her life is one of numbing routine, punctuated only by paying rendezvous with nondescript men.  All the while, a terrible tension is building, or so the viewer suspects.  I do not wish to reveal what happens, but the viewer must take it to the end.

This is arthouse cinema at it best.  Seyrig does an incredible job of acting.",1444176000,4,574,4.578431372549019
3884097,5,B002AFX53C,"Is Jeanne Dielman Plodding? yes. Is it Dull? absolutely. Plotless? Yeah Sort of. But is it also Unforgettable? Absolutely. True, Even lovers of the most artsy avant-garde films might flinch at the idea of sitting down to watch a middle-class French woman do chores for three hours. But by the end you will know what you came for, and you won't forget the payoff. Not ever. Dielman is one of those films that trudges it's way into the tiny, little corpuscles of your mind and supplants itself there with an authoritarian fist, or maybe a Martha Stewart one. Some days you'll be in the kitchen peeling a depressing sack of soil-brown potatoes, or vacuuming a long lonesome hallway, or whatever, and you'll think suddenly to yourself, all the while sighing, ah poor Jeanne Dielman...I know now how you feel. This has happened on multiple occasions to me, and it serves only as a testament to Akerman's brilliant accomplishment with this film, and not to mention the ability of film to alter personal perceptions of everyday reality. I think the painter Vermeer might've liked this film, or maybe he wouldn't have, who cares what the heck Vermeer thinks or thought, take in the tragic beauty of this film for yourself (in one 200 minute gulp if possible) and watch your life change. Trust me, your kitchen will never look the same again.",1433116800,15,1333,4.774891774891775

Also, the 70s setting can be a plus for those who suffer from 70s nostalgia.  Few movies devote so much time to the mundane day-to-day chores/errands in a woman's life.

3884100,5,B002AFX53C,"Fascinating, powerful, hyper-controlled study of woman slowly coming unglued.  Uses its 3 hour+ running time to put you inside the stultifying boredom and ennui of her life, and lets you see the tiny changes in her repetitive days that are powerful and meaningful barometers of the titanic emotions going on behind her blank masque.  Not easy or `fun' to watch.  By definition (and intention?) it gets slow to the point of boredom at times. (Indeed NY Times critic Vincent Canby, who loved the film, jokingly warned that watching it 'could be fatal' if one was in the wrong mood.)  But everything interconnects in an amazingly thought-out way.  Every bit of dialogue (of which there's almost none) leaves a clue, or at least a trace.  Fascinating camerawork; almost always static images. with every cut at 90 degree angles.  And again, when that rule is broken there are specific thematic and storytelling reasons.  A challenging, 'difficult' film, but one not to be missed.",1275264000,5,974,5.0062111801242235
3884101,5,B002AFX53C,"My only criticism is that this film is about 3 hours long. Yes, the film is very detailed, specific, and a work of art. You pay attention to Jeanne Dielman's life on 23 Quai Du Commerce in Brussels, Belgium. Her life is mundane, ritualistic, and almost empty in feeling. The actress, Del Syringe, does a fantastic job in bringing this woman to life. We watch her in her most intimate moments like taking a bath, in the kitchen, having dinner in the dining room, or turning the usual trick for money but one doesn't get to know her as we think we do.

Jeanne Dielman is a widow with a teenage son, Sylvain. Their relationship is quite distant. Sylvain appears to lack much emotion for his mother. It's like their strangers. Anyway, Jeanne turns three tricks for money and not much else. You don't think it's anymore than a business transaction and part of her routine. You don't see her interact much with friends and even her relationship with her son appears cold like two people living in the same apartment.

Jeanne is an attractive widow who prefers her freedom to marriage. You wonder what she is thinking most of the time. Sometimes, she makes a comment but not much more. You wonder if she is fulfilled with her life. She appears to be depressed or I am after watching her. She says a lot more with silence.

This film was first introduced to me by film professor in college. I missed the viewing. I had too. Still, this film makes you think about life in general. Aren't we all like Jeanne Dielman in our lives? Shouldn't we be looking for something too.

The two disc set has several features like the film director, Chantal Ackerman, to provide an explanation and the history of the film as well as understanding the film itself. The first disc is solely the original film. The second disc has the extras.",1274572800,15,1815,4.541284403669724
3884102,5,B002AFX53C,"In the unnerving silence of a sparsely furnished kitchen in Brussels, a poised, anonymous middle-aged woman (Delphine Seyrig) - identified only through the title of the film as Jeanne Dielman - completes her food preparation, places the contents into a large cooking pot on the stove, reaches for a match, lights the burner, and with chronological precision, finishes replacing the matchbox from its original location as the doorbell rings, switching the lights off as she leaves the room. The scene then cuts to an unusually framed shot of a truncated Jeanne at the entrance of the apartment as she accepts a hat and coat from an unidentified guest (Henri Storck) before retreating, out of view, into a bedroom at the end of the hallway. Moments later, the obscured image is reconnected to a familiar referential framing of the darkened hallway as the unknown guest re-emerges from the room and prepares to leave, handing Jeanne a pre-arranged sum of money before confirming their next appointment for the following week. She deposits the money in a soup tureen in the dining room, then returns to the kitchen to attend to the boiling pot, before tidying the bedroom and meticulously bathing and changing clothes after the encounter. And so Jeanne's monotonous daily ritual unfolds through the tedium of household chores, impersonal sexual transactions, trivial errands, and alienated conversations with her son, Sylvain (Jan Decorte), revealing the silent anguish of disconnection and systematic erosion of the human soul.

Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is a visually rigorous, uncompromising, and understatedly harrowing portrait of alienation, repression, and marginalization. Using primarily long take, medium shots from the repeated perspective of a stationary camera, Chantal Akerman creates an innately disquieting atmosphere of stasis and monotony. From the opening image of Jeanne facing away from the camera, to her visually decapitated shot as she politely receives clients by the entrance hallway of the apartment, Akerman uses extended, isolated framing that inhibits personal identification of the title character and reinforces a pervasive sense of unconscious, mechanical activity. The repeated filmic cued scene transitions associated with the actuation of light switches throughout the apartment further underscore the fragmented nature and dehumanized automation of her domestic tasks. By presenting the controlled and deliberate gestures inherent in Jeanne's ritualistic actions that betray an implicit violence beneath the veneer of structure and order - as she bathes (note the similar imagery of cleansing in Michael Haneke's The Seventh Continent), knits, shines shoes (a familiar episode from Akerman's short film, Saute ma ville), and peels potatoes - the film provocatively captures the unarticulated tragedy of estrangement, loneliness, and disconnection.",1264809600,14,2906,5.634703196347032

Little changes in her mood, exchanges with others, even camera angles presaged things to come.

8359422,4,B002AFX53C,"""Jeanne Dielman""(1975) is directed by Chantal Akerman. This one of a kind movie is extremely minimalistic and depicts the routine life of a Brussel woman's humdrum life. She supports her spartan life by prostituting herself in her home to the occasional male client a few days of the week. The film stretches out to three hours and twenty one minutes and focuses on what often seems like real time images of her ritualistic everyday activities, such as making dinner for her and her son (who arrives home later every day for dinner before going to bed), washing dishes, sitting and drinking coffee, reading the newspaper and going out on her daily stroll to pick up supplies for her meals. Nothing much happens in this film but nevertheless it is surprisingly captivating, much as it would be to have a pinhole into the next door neighbour's house, but this all leads to a rather surprising conclusion.
The set has a number of special features, including discussions with the director, and interviews with the actor Delphine Seyrig, and a booklet with an essay by film scholar Ivone Margulies.",1505865600,2,1093,4.881720430107527
