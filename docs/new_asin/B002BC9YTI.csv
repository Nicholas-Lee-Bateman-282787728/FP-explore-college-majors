3892982,5,B002BC9YTI,A MUST see! good for all age groups. So how about we release a region 1 format too? it's been way too long and I know a bunch of peoplel that would love it,1373414400,4,155,3.588235294117647
3892983,5,B002BC9YTI,"I just got to watch this movie at a friend's house and I MUST OWN IT!  Only problem is I can't find a Region 1 or region-free copy.  If anybody knows how I can get my hands on a copy that I CAN ACTUALLY WATCH, please let me know!  Or whoever owns the rights needs to market it in the USA.  So much fun, and an AMAZING time-travel paradox-antiparadox story!!!  Great stuff.",1351555200,4,372,4.111111111111111
3892984,5,B002BC9YTI,"Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel is smart, funny, and fun from the first second of film to the last.  Right from the opening credits, imitated from the old Christopher Reeves Superman movies, to some last funny bits after credits roll.  Pay attention, as the filming was well thought out for its gags.

If there was one reference that influenced the super successful Big Bang Theory TV show, it was this movie.  You don't have to be a Dr. Who fan or a ComicCon goer to enjoy and laugh through this picture.

It's fun for the whole family, by the way.  No particularly scary (some light scary - but humorous), no gory scenes, etc.

Unfortunately at the time of this writing it is still not available for Region 1 US DVD players.  What I did was set a spare computer DVD's setting to Region 2 so I can watch imports.

Enjoy and live safe!",1351036800,5,848,4.454545454545454
3892985,4,B002BC9YTI,"Not quite as funny as I had hoped, but my hopes were sky-high. If you lower your expectations just a notch (hence four stars instead of five), it's terrific.

The characters have conversations dear to every nerd's heart, such as why we need more ""Firefly"" and whether Han shot first. The non-nerd character confuses ""Star Wars"" with ""Star Trek,"" to the outrage of his two friends.

There are references galore to ""Doctor Who,"" ""A Sound of Thunder,"" ""Galaxy Quest,"" and other nerd favorites. And, of course, the characters have to avoid tripping over each other when they cross their own timelines.

My biggest complaint: Not enough Anna Faris! And not *enough* of Anna Faris, either, if you catch my meaning ...

One warning: It's a Region 2 (Europe) DVD, so you can't play it unless you have a Region 2 or code-free DVD player. But most sci-fi nerds (excuse me, ""science fiction imagineers"") probably have code-free DVD players. If you don't have one, invest a few bucks and get one; they're pretty cheap on Amazon.",1328572800,6,1016,4.788571428571428
3892986,4,B002BC9YTI,"One of the thing I enjoy about a good time romp is that it must fit together like a quality mystery; at the end the scales will fall from one's eyes and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place like an atheist's watch.  This little film fully exercises the major tropes of time travel, poking merry gentle fun at us Science Fiction nerds all along the way.  Unfortunately the only available distribution is region 2, but Handbrake is my friend.  I recommend this little comedy to SF fans with a sense of humor; mundanes will likely miss the point and wind up dazed and confused.",1314489600,2,578,4.433962264150943
3892987,5,B002BC9YTI,"What an adventure! This movie is really good and funny. Anna Faris is one of the main reasons to see this movie, she is really good in it. The movie is funny and one you wouldn't want to miss! The DVD includes NO special features. Includes English Audio and English Subtitles, but thats it. If you are going to buy this DVD, buy it on Amazon.co.uk it's really cheap and the shipping is really cheap as well, quick shipping!",1286496000,2,423,4.367088607594937

3892990,5,B002BC9YTI,you'll have to view it 3 times to understand what is not going on. Twice. Before you do. Or not.,1402704000,,96,3.85
3892991,5,B002BC9YTI,"I stumbled across this movie on HBOGo and I was hooked.  I'm even dressing up one of my friends as Pete for our upcoming scifi convention (I mean Science Fiction, lol).  They need to release this on US format quickly.",1401148800,,217,4.4
3892992,4,B002BC9YTI,"If you like sci-fi and time travel theories then this is quite entertaining. Lots of arguing about geeky stuff and then everything becomes unhinged. Not big-budget or high-octane but great actors, characters and ideas.",1399334400,,218,5.4411764705882355
3892993,4,B002BC9YTI,A fun little lost gem! A British friend showed it to me...Funny how it didn't seem as good the second time around but that's probably due to me knowing what was going to happen (duh). Chris O' Dowd always elevates whatever he's in and Anna Faris is good in this too :),1398816000,,268,4.173076923076923
3892994,5,B002BC9YTI,"Been looking for this movie since we first saw it years ago. Had to get an ""all region"" DVD player to play it as it's region 2, but that was fine. Great movie!",1383782400,,159,3.8484848484848486
3892995,5,B002BC9YTI,My husband and I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to others. Not sure what else to say.,1380672000,,103,4.2
3892996,5,B002BC9YTI,"This movie contained a multitude of twists and turns in the story due to it's time traveling nature but unlike other movies [and some tv shows] it brought everything together neatly in the end. Not to say everything was done perfectly but it's such a hilarious movie I could forgive the little slip up here and there. For the majority of the movie I was wondering just how they'd tie everything up and it didn't let me down, if fact if beat my expectations.

If you think Doctor Who does timey-whimey well, check out this movie and see how it can be done to the extreme.",1376524800,,570,4.377358490566038
3892997,5,B002BC9YTI,"This co- HBO/BBC production is about --- naturally --- Time Travel, AVAILABLE in Europe and America.
But is it an NTSC (American video standard)? No! Used to be I'd buy it anyway, and put it in my VERY expensive
VHS/DVD player that plays ANY tape/disc from ANY-where on any TV, ANY-where... which only has the older, inter-
national, output jacks... no HDMI ports. My NEW TV has seven HDMI plugs, but no longer has RCA jacks.

8360980,4,B002BC9YTI,"This is a great movie, I highly recommend it. The only reason I'm not giving it a five out of five is because I'm from the United States and can't play this movie here unless I have a region free player, which thankfully my dad had. Another thing to note about this movie is that it came with a sticker on the front that I couldn't take off very well and left residue which annoys the movie collector in me, but overall the movie is great and can't complain too much.",1502582400,,467,4.142857142857143

8360984,5,B002BC9YTI,"Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel is a hilarious take on time travel through the perspective of bar room conversation between friends. Being a movie intended for the UK market it's not the fast paced, laugh-a-second Hollywood production you might be used to, but it's down tempo pace, great lines and thought provoking humor gives you time to enjoy the film, rather than force you to keep up with it. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously either, poking fun of Anna Faris's ""American accent"" and other cultural phenomenon. On comedic par with ""Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle"", FAQ About Time Travel is an offbeat and irreverent movie that would be a gem in anyone's DVD collection and allow you to make some coin when you mockingly tout to your friends, ""I've got a movie I'll bet you've NEVER seen!""

...As has been noted this is a region 2 DVD. Some players are region free, others provide information on resetting the region code in their instruction manuals, but some (like mine) required a bit of internet searching to find the instructions, much cheaper than buying a new player and kinda fun too, like I was a hacker!",1452556800,,1145,4.7537688442211055
