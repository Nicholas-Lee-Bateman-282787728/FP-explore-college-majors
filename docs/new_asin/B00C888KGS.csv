5696943,5,B00C888KGS,This is a well done history of Chatsworth. Great photography and commentary. Only thing better would be to actually visit the site.,1393545600,2,131,5.0
5696944,5,B00C888KGS,"Having watched an English documentary on English Castles ""Chatsworth"" is one that I want to see on my next trip to England.",1388188800,,123,4.636363636363637
5696945,4,B00C888KGS,"Sorry that i cannot rate this as yet, it was purchased as a Christmas gift. So, I will have to let you know
much later on; I will say that I find castles fascinating, some so cold and uninviting, some a bit warmer
and tempting to visit ~ all with lots of stories contained within their walls I'm sure.",1382572800,,301,4.11864406779661
5696946,3,B00C888KGS,"It's in DVD format and rather poor resolution for todays high definintion TVs, but still a compelling story.  If it was remastered in Blu Ray, I'd buy another copy.  Good gift for those with limited TV choices.",1381622400,3,210,4.648648648648648
5696947,5,B00C888KGS,I watched this several times and bought it because I kept catching on parts of it on PBS.  Gorgeous building and grounds!  Very happy they're not my responsibility,1378684800,3,163,4.785714285714286

5696949,3,B00C888KGS,While this was somewhat interesting it definitely was not what I expected or was looking for. It's mainly a history of the Cavendish family with an occasional look at the house. They talk about notorious members of the family and ignore the rooms and the art and the sculpture. I kept waiting for them to actually say so and so painted this or this happened here and this is why this was done. They did better on the gardens but even there spent a lot of time on a building that is no longer there. Quite a disappointment. Wish I'd seen it on PBS so I'd've known not to waste my money on it. Guess I should have bought the 25 year old tour instead! I think the same Duke (then Marquess of Hartingdon) did the tour guiding.,1375401600,20,722,4.239130434782608

It has many gorgeous rooms and the outside window frames of the house's main block are coated with thin sheets of gold. According to Matthew Hirst: ""It's an expression of wealth, but it also has very practical application, because it doesn't need renewing as often as paint. It lasts about 30 years.""

The Cavendish family has had its share of interesting characters, and even celebrities. Adele Astaire was a huge star, half of a dancing duo with her brother Fred. She married into the family in 1932. Patriarch Joe Kennedy brought his family to England when he was appointed US Ambassador to England. His spunky daughter, Kathleen, married the heir to Chatsworth, Billy Cavendish.

The show's commentators include Peregrine Cavendish (12th Duke of Devonshire), Matthew Hirst (head of collections), Steve Porter (head gardener), Amanda Foreman (author ""The Duchess""), Hannah Obee (curator), Christine Robinson (head housekeeper), Elizabeth Kehoe (author ""The Titled Americans""), Amanda Smith (Kathleen Kennedy's niece) and Lynne McTaggart (author ""Kathleen Kennedy).

The show originally aired in 2013 and is 56 minutes in length. If you purchase it on disc, English subtitles are available. There are no bonus features on the disc. ""The Secrets of Chatsworth"" is just one in a series. Five of the series' episodes can be purchased in a 5-DVD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-Iconic-British-Estates/dp/B00KX44RNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of Iconic British Estates</a>.

I found this show enjoyable. But it is more about the history of Chatsworth and the intersting people who called it home. I want to highly recommend something even better, chock full of photos of the rooms.. The current Duke's mother, Deborah Cavendish, was the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire when she died in 2015. She was a very good writer and excelled at story-telling and deprecating humor. I think her coffee table book on Chatsworth is the best ""big house"" book that I have, and I have a lot of them!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chatsworth-The-House/dp/0711216754/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chatsworth: The House</a>.

8578596,5,B00C888KGS,"What a joy to watch this unique estate and its gardens with so much history. With some sixty million population, UK has only eleven Dukes. At a time when the income of an average UK citizen was only twenty British Pounds, the Duke would have house parties with turtles flown in from Caribbean at a cost of twenty Pounds for each turtle for a single turtle soup. Now imagine having one hundred plus guests at each party. Extremely well done documentary with much history about the Chatsworth dynasty including Kathleen Kennedy who married Billy Cavendish, heir of the 10th Duke of Devonshire. Kathleen died in a plane crash and was buried at Chatsworth.",1417392000,4,652,4.778761061946903
