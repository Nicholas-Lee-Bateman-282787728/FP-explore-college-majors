CORRECTION:  the above was due to user-failure.  Duh!

This DVD is gorgeous!  Exactly what I hoped for to enjoy on my new LG OLED TV.  Wow.

This is a real coral reef, not a coral-reef aquarium.  Images are very hi-def, visually stunning and fascinating.  Music is very pleasant, too.

FIVE STARS!!",1420848000,,358,4.629032258064516
