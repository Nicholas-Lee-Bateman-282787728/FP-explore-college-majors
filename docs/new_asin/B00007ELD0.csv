7975628,5,B00007ELD0,My son's birthday present. He loves NSYNC and I was very happy to be able to order this for him. Think he will love it.,1452902400,,119,3.8
7975629,5,B00007ELD0,"Still love this group, even after all these years.",1433203200,,50,4.666666666666667
7975630,5,B00007ELD0,"These videos take us back to a time when solid, melodious beats; cheesy choreography, and winning on-camera personalities could carry a handsome group of talented young men to well-deserved musical stardom. More innocent times, before the raunchiness of rap and monotonous radio-blasted 4-minute/3-note 'songs' and new overnight 'artists'. Bitter...party of one.
If you like GOOD SOLID MUSIC, FUN LYRICS, AND PROFESSIONAL HARMONIZING AND VOCALS, these videos will CHARM you...again.",1432425600,,482,6.0
7975631,5,B00007ELD0,Bought this for my cousin for his birthday and he enjoyed it.  Does not have all the video's that you might want.  Just from the Pop album.  Just wished there was more,1375833600,,167,4.15625
7975632,4,B00007ELD0,"This is definitely a must have for *NSYNC fans.  It has a great collection of videos including alternative mix and live performance videos.  It contains videos from their latest two albums NO STRINGS ATTACHED and CELEBRITY.

What I also like about this collection is that you can have the lyrics displayed on the screen as you watch the video.  It's great for those who aren't too sure of the lyrics or don't know it completely.",1124150400,2,428,4.666666666666667
7975633,5,B00007ELD0,"I think this is the greatest idea ever... a collection of the best videos by the best group in the world....*Nsync. I really enjoy watching this over and over. I was hoping that they would have had Nsync live with the song Pop from the Road to Celebrity.  I would love to have that video. Other than that this collection is better than excellent. A pat on the back to the person that came up with the idea of putting videos on DVD.
I recommend this highly to all *Nsync and non fans of this super talented group.",1045526400,,512,4.224489795918367
7975634,5,B00007ELD0,"This DVD, is a perfect stocking stuffer for any Nsync fan. The DVD includes a hit list of the most requested videos. I know all the Nsync fans out there miss the boys. Well this will cheer you up until they come back in 2003. Also other great Nsync items are...Popodyssey Live...The Reel Nsync...Making the Tour...So buy this DVD and HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
