7982803,1,B00008G820,"This might well be the best available DVD copy of Mission Monte Carlo, but then again there is really no reason to buy it (now I'm sorry I did). It's VHS quality (good VHS, as VHS goes), but you can get these two episodes in excellent DVD quality separately (as part of the regular Persuaders episodes), and that's a much better deal. Because that's all Mission Monte Carlo is: Not an actual movie, not even a series pilot (which, for some reason, I thought it was), just two Persuaders episodes slapped together (Episode 5: Powerswitch, and Episode 2: The Gold Napoleon). What about the other show on this combo DVD, Eagles Attack At Dawn? Don't know, haven't watched it yet.",1496534400,,676,4.641666666666667
7982804,3,B00008G820,This is the best copy for picture and sound that I have found for MISSION MONTE CARLO.  Forget the others with such poor picture quality.  Monte Carlo is an entertaining movie that will not disappoint.  Haven`t watched Eagles as it does not interest me.,1372982400,,253,4.704545454545454
