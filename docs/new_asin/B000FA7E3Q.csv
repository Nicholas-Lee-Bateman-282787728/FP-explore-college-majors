8119737,2,B000FA7E3Q,"This video is completely overpriced for what you get. The quality of the video is poor, it was filmed in an office with minimal editing. When the host shows you a chart of his theory on how our mind processes unwanted and anxious thoughts, it's literally a printed out paper chart, they didn't use a computer graphic or something more visually appealing and comprehensive to demonstrate his ideas. As to the actual process he teaches for anxiety, I have no idea if it could work. My husband and I  watched the dvd in two parts, as instructed, and the method gets more and more wacky as the dvd goes on, until at the end we questioned not only the process, but the host's sanity as well. I purchased this dvd to help my husband overcome his fear of flying, and all other methods of relaxation and meditation cds were far more effective for him. This dvd has had no perceptible success in helping my husband with anxiety regarding flying or anything else. Basically, it only functions when I perform the method for him, to amuse and distract him, reciting the phrases as instructed in the dvd and exhaling with my diaphraghm, performing the hand movements, all the while making kung fu noises like Bruce Lee (the Bruce Lee sounds are my modification). I should mention, he did try the methods seriously in the days proceeding our flight, and when work stressed him out, and he said it didn't seem to help, despite repeatedly trying to use the techniques here. I recommend this only as a last ditch effort in overcoming your anxiety. If nothing else works, this might, as it seems to have for the other people who commented. I just felt the need to relate our experience with the video since all other reviews were so glowing, and we thought it was really only good for a laugh, or to scare people, and little else.",1196812800,3,1812,4.558282208588957
8119738,5,B000FA7E3Q,"After a nasty divorce 4 years ago my anxiety problems, which had previously been minor, became almost crippling. Then about a year ago, I found out that my husband had remarried and I was totally devastated.

Some days I'd be fine but sometimes when I least expected it I'd hear a song or see something on TV and the panic would set in. Shallow breathing, racing heartbeat, and crying. I'd cry for hours. I developed a fear of public places as my self-image became lower and lower. I gained weight and this just added to my anxiety and low self-esteem.

After the worse six months of my life, the near loss of my job and perhaps a nervous breakdown I found the strength in October 2005 to seriously commit myself to cleaning up my act and beating my problems with anxiety. I took professional counselling but that was expensive and I actually felt worse as the message I was getting was that my anxiety was just in my mind. I felt like an absolute loser. Then I tried Yoga classes but found that I only felt good for very short periods.

Just when I was about to give up, I found the Trip-Wire solution on the Internet. This DVD is by a guy from England called Boyd Brent. I totally related to what he was saying in the trailer I saw so I got a copy of the DVD. What I heard actually surprised me. My anxiety wasn't only in my mind; there were chemical reactions in my body that made me feel the way I did. The next time you panic and someone tells you to ""Take a deep breath"", don't! This DVD explained to me the importance of breathing out and how I could take control of my body's negative reactions to thoughts and memories that made me anxious.

In a matter of days I felt so much better. Gradually my confidence began to return and I'm no longer anxious about being in a crowd. But the most important thing is that I no longer have panic attacks.

This Trip-Wire system actually works! The DVD is easy to follow and you can do all the exercises step by step at your own pace. I only wish I had found it sooner!!!",1144368000,3,2018,4.258485639686684
8119739,5,B000FA7E3Q,This is such a refreshing approach.  I've tried many things to help me with my anxiety and panic attacks.  The closest thing to T.W.S. would I guess be cognitive therapy.  But this goes much further.  By following the layered instructions I can now control my abdomen and diaphragm muscles (through breathing) in a way that really does FLATTEN feelings of anxiety on-the-spot.  By doing these exercises I'm apparently releasing feel good endorphins into my body.  I really don't care how it works-- I have so much more confidence now.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is suffering with anxiety-- as long as you have the time and determination to follow the step-by-step instructions.,1144368000,5,692,4.965217391304348
