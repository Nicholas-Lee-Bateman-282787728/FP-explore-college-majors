1392394,5,B0000541UQ,This is a wonderful video!  I wish something like this had been around when I was a child.  The best way to conquer fear is through humor and this video is very funny.  The puppets are great.  I highly recommend it.,983577600,,215,4.170731707317073
1392395,5,B0000541UQ,"My daughter was terrified to go for her first checkup to the dentist,but after viewing this video  she is no longer fearful. She has gone on her first trip to the denist and it went great! This video is a  must for all children to see!!!",983577600,,237,4.130434782608695
1392396,5,B0000541UQ,"I recently obtained a copy of this video for my three year old granddaughter who is about to make a visit to the dentist for the first time.  She truly enjoys this video and I am sure that she now has an better understanding of what to expect at the dentist's office.  However, equally important is the entertaining value of this video. She repeatedly watches it and loves the music, the puppets, their costumes and the scenery. And she is now joined by her one year old brother who also is fascinated by the video.  In fact, he recently had to make an  emergency visit to the dental office and he seemed to adjust easily to the new surroundings. I attribute this acceptance, in part, to his frequent exposure to Pinatta's View.",983491200,,728,4.492424242424242
7930511,5,B0000541UQ,"Packed with a powerful punch for any preschooler!  I have a 3-year-old and twins who will be 2 in April.  I'm really shocked that there are no other videos (that I'm aware of) dealing with a first trip to the dentist.  I took my 3-year-old to the dentist back in January for the first time, and it was very unsuccessful.  But I bought this video a few weeks ago, and she asks to watch it every day!  Sometimes several times a day!  The twins love it too!  I'm hoping they'll come out with ""A Trip To The Hairdresser"" and ""A Trip To The Doctor"" soon!",1046390400,,549,4.171428571428572
7930512,5,B0000541UQ,"Apprehensive about any doctor, especially the Dentist, my son found this video to be ""cool"".  Tapping his foot to the beat of the music while viewing the dentist office through Pinatta's glasses gave my son a feeling actually being there.  Knowing what to expect when it was his turn to really sit in the dentist chair my son breezed through the visit calm, cool, and collected.
I would recommend this video to all parents of lil' ""cool"" boys both for the educational value as well as entertainment.  Remember that kids are only scared of the unknown.  Through Pinatta's glasses the unknown can be known.",985737600,,604,4.778846153846154
7930513,5,B0000541UQ,"I so enjoyed ""Pinatta's View"" and would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone with a small child. I was so impressed with the unique way it took a scary subject like going to the dentist and made it funny and entertaining. This delightful video allows a child to really see the experience with their own eyes. I believe that children are so amazingly adaptable if they are given honest information and they can be quite courageous as long as they know what's going to happen. This is such a perfect way to prepare them for what could be a nerve-wracking event by putting them in the driver's seat. The character of Pinatta is so charming for kids and adults and I only hope there will be more tapes with Pinatta's view of the world. Great Video!!!!!!",985564800,,752,4.5777777777777775
7930514,5,B0000541UQ,I feel this video is a entertaining  and  educational experience for children.  I have shared it with several of my grandchildren and a see them just get so excited and smiling while watching.  I personally feel that early and positive  dental care is so important to healthy grandchildren.,984096000,,290,4.958333333333333
7930515,5,B0000541UQ,"In truth, as an adult, my taste in dental cinema inclines toward ""Marathon Man"".  However, any video that will stop my kid from screaming, a la Dustin Hoffman, when he has to visit the dentist, and have him singing and gleefully looking forward to that visit, has got my vote.  Bless the child.  Bless the dentist. Bless this video!",984009600,,332,4.593220338983051
7930516,5,B0000541UQ,"Wow, it always amazes me the amount of talent and incredible dedication and caring there exists in this world.  In this video you will see it in abundance.  I'd love to see this show on television for my children on a regular basis.  The attention to details and truth is great.  Very informative too and a very cute format.  This is a highly reccomended video.  A+ !!",983923200,,368,4.417910447761194
7930517,5,B0000541UQ,"""Pinatta's View"" is a very entertaining video which should make a child's first visit to the dentest a pleasent experience.  The puppets are delightful, the music is catchy and the acting is excellent.  The video is a pleasure to view, even if you're not takeing a child to the dentest.  The format offers delightful chacters and lively music that will bring a smile to your face.",983923200,,380,4.7272727272727275
7930518,5,B0000541UQ,Pinatta's first video is outstanding entertainment and has the bonus that it promotes good dental health.  The music and lyrics are first rate and certain to keep a child's attention.  You'll find yourself humming the melodies long after the tape's rewound.  It provides an excellent preparation for a child's first trip to the dentist.,983836800,,336,5.185185185185185
7930519,5,B0000541UQ,"I got this video from the dentist before I took my 3 year-old in for his first appointment.  It was terrific.  My son watched it a number of times and we ""practiced"" before his visit.  When he got there he knew what to expect and wasn't scared at all, in fact he was telling the dentist what to do next!  I highly recommend this video for first timers or children who are a bit wary of dental visits.  Plus, its fun.  My son still asks to watch, ""That singing puppet who goes to the dentist.""",983577600,,492,4.126315789473685
7930520,5,B0000541UQ,I would recommend the video to all families with children going to the dentist for the first time.  It is very educational and entertaining at the same time.  Very nicely done!!!,983577600,,178,4.709677419354839
