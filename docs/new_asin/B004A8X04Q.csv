8419798,5,B004A8X04Q,I loved this show as a kid and I was stoked to get my hands on it. Fast shipping.,1498435200,,81,3.3157894736842106
8419799,5,B004A8X04Q,"This show is quite possibly the most divisive show ever made. Either you get it or you don't.

Here's why this show is my favorite cartoon ever made: it has this incredibly rare quality which leaves the major plot machinations almost completely up to the viewer's interpretation. Every time I watch it through it leaves me with a better sense of my personal interpretation, which, in the end is a reflection on me, more than on Mr. Maiellaro. Fitz is a likable and relatable character from scene one onward. Sick metal shreds, excellent side characters, banter is on point, all-in-all a classic.

(Matt, if you're reading this, thank you for giving us Mouse Fitzgerald. If you're ever in Portland, Oregon I make a mean corndog)",1481760000,2,727,4.808
8419800,5,B004A8X04Q,"Obscure, rare, and overshadowed by numerous other Adult Swim series, 12oz Mouse is still one of my favorite animated shows to come from Adult Swim. This DVD set has all 20 episodes combined into one big movie, with half on each disc. There are also a bunch of extras on the discs including fan art of the show's characters, extra animations that weren't part of the main series that revolve around a subplot, and music from the show. I won't spoil the show's plot too much, but it follows the drunken, destructive adventures of Mouse Fitzgerald, a green alcoholic mouse and his best friend Skillet, a chinchilla that can shoot eye lasers and can hover using flaming jets from his feet. Most of the plot involves them joining forces with supporting cast of strange characters against the series' corporate, conspiratorial villains, Shark and Rectangular Businessman, who are literally a shark and a rectangle who is a businessman. If you like drug and alcohol humor and the Matrix movies, you will enjoy this. The show's art style is minimalistic and simple, but it works well with the humor. My favorite thing to do is get drunk and try to see if the humor is better while drunk, though I've never done this successfully because I always fall asleep, it makes an excellent sleep aid. Stoners will also enjoy their own version of this challenge, especially when the character Peanut Cop shows up.",1452124800,,1395,4.79253112033195

8419803,5,B004A8X04Q,"This is an amazing DVD! The only thing is, I think the current price of the DVD is more than how much money the production company that made the whole TV series.  I got lucky and bit the bullet when it was 29 dollars, but I am so glad I bought it.  Not because I wish to resell it, but because this show is really a gem, and I love watching it with my friends and talk about all the theories we have about the story line. Perhaps I am a very shallow human being, but this is bar none, one of my fave DVD's that I own.",1350604800,9,517,3.7777777777777777
