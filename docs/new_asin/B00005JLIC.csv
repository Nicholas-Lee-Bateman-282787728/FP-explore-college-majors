1454913,5,B00005JLIC,"I've tried 3 or 4 times to put a review on here, but the computer kept jamming.  I've come back after a few days and have read the other reviews here, and literally, ""they took the words right out of my mouth"".  WOW!  This set is great!  I never have seen these episodes look so brilliant, even with whatever TVLand or Nick did to them when they added them to their line-up.  I hadn't seen most of the first season (inclusive of the first episode, which I only saw for the first time two or three years ago), so this is a treat to get them all.  It is also nice to have the French and Spanish versions of the soundtrack to see how they played in different countries.  It is unusual to play the French track, and get the 2nd season version of the opening theme with no vocal.  All others have the first season version.  Sound quality is also marvelous.  I wish they were doing I LOVE LUCY like this vs. one DVD a few shows at a time, but you can't have everything.  Still, Lucy does appear in the Emmy sequences on the Bonus disc, with probably the best documentary on the series, superceding the recent anniversary specials on CBS and TVLand.  I hope they continue it season by season, as it was mentioned inside the package, Season Two comes out in March 2003.  Fabulous work and worth every penny.",1033430400,6,1299,4.296296296296297
1454914,5,B00005JLIC,"This excellent dvd does not dissapoint, presenting crystal clear quality picture and sound.
All of the classic first season episodes are here, even though they are not as funny as some of the other seasons, they still hold up well.
So, if you grew up watching this show or you have only recently been watching this on tv, I urge you to go out and buy this great set.",1033171200,3,366,4.318840579710145
1454915,5,B00005JLIC,"Like many people, I was thrilled to hear that Fox was going to put out this set, but wondered exactly how well the final product would come off. After purchasing the set and watching a good portion of it I can certainly say that it met or exceeded all my expectations. The show itself, of course, is excellent, groundbreaking comedy with strong endearing characters and funny yet sophisticated writing.
But beyond that, Fox has done an excellent job in bringing this show to DVD. I am extremely picky when it comes to picture quality, and I'll have to say the film transfer is absolutely beautiful, with razor-sharp focus, rich color, as well as deep blacks and clear highlights. I have never seen this show look so good. Generally the condition of the film seems excellent with only minor pinhole spots and a little dust. It's hard to believe the film is in such good condition after 30 years of storage and use. The quality of the audio is not quite as good, but this seems to have more to do with the acoustics of the original sound stage and not with the mastering of the DVD.
The packaging is great, well designed and functional. There is a nice little booklet with all the expected information in it, as well as a nice note from Fox telling us we can expect the second season set to come out in March 2003.
There are some really nice extras, including a substantial and insightful doucmentary on the making of the show, rare Emmy Awards footage, as well as some CBS promo tags and a small photo gallery. There are a few episodes with commentaries from David Davis, Ed Asner, and others affiliated with the show, and these are quite good, giving the viewer a solid understanding of the production process as well as the show's concept and casting decisions that led to the hiring of the now-legendary actors. I only wish every episode had a commentary.
Overall, I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this DVD set. Even if you are not an avid fan of the show, you'll learn so much about the basics of good sitcom writing, pacing, acting, and prodcution, that it may be worth picking up this set just for that knowledge. The show's characters and style of humor really can grow on you. And if you already like the show, you'll love this set.
I really hope that Fox will next turn their attention to The Bob Newhart Show, which is another excellent sitcom from MTM Productions made only 2 years later, with many of the same writers, directors, and producers. The Bob Newhart Show deserves this same top-quality treatment they have given Mary Tyler Moore.",1033084800,15,2566,4.604803493449782
1454916,5,B00005JLIC,"Love is all around, because ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show's"" debut on DVD is fantastic! Gone are the dull, faded, nearly colorless images we've seen on re-runs. The picture quality far surpasses what I had thought possible for the show. Everything looks wonderful! Bright, true-to-life colors (even reds and greens!) and a crisp, clear picture really bring out the details -- especially in the sets and in those great 1970's clothes.
In addition to the pristine video, each episode boasts ten chapter stops (bookmarks), and the sound is fine too.
This is an excellent season of a great TV series. We can now enjoy a picture to match the high quality writing and acting of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" Treat yourself!",1033084800,6,713,4.852459016393443
1454917,5,B00005JLIC,"What can I say? After just one viewing, I am seeing these shows completely anew, even after purchasing all the pre-recorded videos that I could.
ALL of the episodes are of pristine quality, and three have running commentary. An extra DVD is included for the bonus material, which is terrific. The packaging is FIRST class, with each DVD containing a letter -- M -A -R- Y!!!! It's clarity even surpasses the recent M*A*S*H DVD releases. My ONLY complaint is that about 30 seconds is missing from the Christmas ""Hard Luck Kid"" episode. When Mary is singing along to White Christmas, then says ""Thank you, thank you. And for my next number, I think I'm gonna cry."" That has been deleted for some reason. But thirty seconds could never make me take back my five star rating for this classic release, certain to be a huge seller.
A word to the producers: don't leave out ONE second of these shows. Even though they have been shown edited for many years, several have been released complete on video, like the above episode, so we know what is missing. There is no reason at all to have any footage missing. The hardcore fans of this series, like myself, DO notice these things. But we also notice the brilliant colors, fabrics, set designs, and sharpness that these shows now contain. Let's see all seven seasons on DVD, and don't forget the ""Last Show"" final bows!!",1032998400,6,1361,4.651452282157677
1454918,5,B00005JLIC,"I got this DVD set as soon as it was on the shelves, and although I haven't seen the entire set yet, I have seen enough of it to say that it is a truly overwhelming experience. Cradling the box was like holding the holy grail of television in my own hands. No more watching ""Mary Tyler Moore"" on fuzzy reruns on obscure UHF stations or watching edited versions on Nick-At-Nite. It's all mine - the whole first season.
When you watch the episodes, you'll find it hard to believe that in 1970 most television sets were still black and white, and stereo television was unheard of. Although the sound is mono, it comes across sharp and clear. The theme song never sounded better. The most striking aspect is the visual appearance of the show - bright and rich colors in the wardrobes and the sets. And best of all, no abrupt cuts or edits - these are the full-length episodes as originally aired!
In one swoop, this DVD box set outdoes anything that was ever attempted for the VHS format. Many of you might recall the frustration of knowing that only two episodes per season were available on the MTM VHS box set. This DVD collection alone is twice as large - and there are six more sets to come! (By the way, for those of you who haven't yet bought the collection, an insert in the box says that the second season is coming out in March.)
Now for a few minor criticisms.  Mind you, these criticisms are only the result of the high standards which this box set has in the first place.  First, only three of the twenty-four episodes have commentary. Commentators like Allan Burns, Jim Brooks, David Davis, Jay Sandrich, and Ed Asner (""Mr. Asner"", as he is repeatedly called) bring out new and fascinating details and background tidbits, such as how the MTM cat was filmed, or how much they respected the acting talents of Nancy Walker and Cloris Leachman. Yet the commentary on these three episodes makes watching the other twenty-one more difficult, because you find yourself wondering what they would have said about the uproarious performance of Shelley Berman in ""Divorce Isn't Everything"", along with many other excellent scripts and guest stars over the course of the season.
Second, although the ""making of"" documentary is well-done and fascinating, it left out some key material. Much was said about the infamous original scene filmed between Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner that flopped, but only stills were shown from the scene. I would have rather seen that scene in full as a bonus than some of the six nearly identical CBS promos (entertaining though they were).
Overall, this is a five-star product for a five-star show. If you appreciate classic television, or want to watch the one show that can really bring you back to the 1970s, this is where to look!",1032912000,5,2764,4.6503067484662575
1454919,5,B00005JLIC,"Great stuff! Crisp, bright colors and super-sharp picture! SO MUCH BETTER than the reruns we've seen over and over on TV....it's almost like watching these shows for the very first time, that's how terrific these DVDs look! The ""making of"" feature has Moore, Asner, Harper, Leachman, White and the great MacLeod reminiscing. There's also a VERY sexy pic of Mary inside the box....wow! Original CBS promos and more...Not to be missed if you're a fan!",1032912000,,449,5.0
1454920,5,B00005JLIC,"I'm only 11 years old and I Love Mary Tyler Moore. The Show is great. When I was watching the Mary Tyler Moore Reunion, I was bursting out in tears after they said final episode. Also when Mary turned off the lights to the office when everyone was singing in the backround, I couldn't stand seeing the lights turned off forever. That Show was the greatest. I only watch reruns, but I still love the show. I love you Mary Tyler Moore. You're My Idol, I look up to you and I hope I get to meet you someday.

1455005,5,B00005JLIC,"Show is wonderful, of course! I've had no problems with the DVDs themselves, and the special features are a nice bonus. Only one problem so far - the case is a bit shoddy and puts all the DVDs in one case rather than several small cases in one large cardboard accompaniment as with previous season sets. The DVDs are housed in a plastic thing like a binder with a place for each disk which is attached to the spine of the case itself. This binder-like thing has fallen out from the case before, although thankfully the DVDs did not fall out with it and were not scratched.

I was too new to this country to understand the social implications of the show but I just loved it. After hearing of her death, all the memories of the show came back to me and I felt I had to watch them again.  Watching them again after more than 30 years later has helped me realize that the show dealt with many social issues of early 1970s such as racism and sexism. Yet the show gave away this feeling of goodness of American society and people that it was a wonderful introduction to someone like me who had just arrived to US.

It seems like it was only yesterday that we had Mary to help us escape from Vietnam and Watergate. This show was a gentle trailblazer that entered our family room every Saturday night with only one message - work hard, and be kind.

To not take away from the rating of the show, I won't give anything but a 5-star rating, but I will say I was very disappointed and frustrated with how these discs are set up.  There is no 'Play All' feature and you have to go back to Main Menu every single time just to go to the next episode.  And each episode has 8 chapters.  Pretty useless to have 8 chapters for a 30-minute episode.  Whoever thought this was a good idea should be smacked w a DVD case.

My friends and I never went out on Saturday night until after Mary was on (this was before VCR's and DVR's).  These were the first women characters we could relate to (Rhoda even ""tawked"" like us), and it's kind of strange seeing and remembering now how things were back then for working women.  This show did some serious ground breaking for women on TV.

All of the characters and actors are so terrific and the writing is among the best there ever was for a comedy series.  It always feels like a visit with good friends when I spend some time with this cast.  Laughs are always guaranteed, and you can't beat the actors and writing.

For one, they don't make comedies like this any more.

The  unique approach to innocence and hope; love and acceptance of friends who are different from us; and the appreciation of life's humorous as well as sad times in life have not been seen on TV since the Mary Tyler Moore show went off the air.

The actors were all top notch. Watching the first season now, the writer's and the production team were still finding their way. That's typical of most shows in their first year and sometimes into the second year. Most well-written shows usually hit their stride in their third year. I think that the uneveness comes with the too cutesy dialogus in some instances. The standout episode for me was ""Support your local mother,"" which introduced the world to Nancy Walker as Ida Morgenstern, Rhoda's (s)mother.

1455998,5,B00005JLIC,"Love, indeed, was all around in 1970 when ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" came into our homes.  When we were introduced to Mary Richards, we quickly learned that she was just a girl from Roseburg, Minnesota who had spunk, a run in her hose and could instantaneously make us fall in love with her.  But Mary Richards was so much more; she represented a generation of women who came into their own, supported themselves and worked hard to create a career.  Mary was my own mom and many other women, and I wanted to be like them...and have spunk.

The first season introduces us to Mary's newsroom job at WJM in Minneapolis and her open-spaced, charming apartment.  With that, came the best supporting cast in television:  Valerie Harper as her best friend- Rhoda, Ed Asner as her boss- Lou Grant, Cloris Leachman as friend and landlord- Phyllis, Gavin MacLeod as co-worker- Murray and Ted Knight as the self-enamored anchorman- Ted Baxter.

This is an ensemble show, but Mary is the glue.  Her comedic timing is like a Swiss watch.  She is funny, but you also care about her, her dates, her work woes.  And though she's playing a young, single woman, she's always an adult with class.  There's such a stark contrast to today's shows where everyone seems endlessly immature & the focus is on sleaze.  Mary and her friends were smart, witty, zany and sometimes goofy but they were always grown-ups.

The writing on this entire series is superb, and it can't be compared to anything we have on television today.  The first season started with a bang.  The characters evolved as the series went on, but from the start the actors were in full character.  There are 24 episodes and some are classics:  The first episode ""Love is All Around"" has the oft-repeated ""You've got spunk"" scene.  Another great one is ""The Snow Must Go On,"" where Ted ad-libs election results.  This DVD also offers great special features:  A documentary about the making of the show, Emmy award clips, a trivia challenge & photo gallery of the cast.

I highly recommend the first season.  It will turn your world on with a smile.",1331424000,4,2093,4.676712328767123

1456224,5,B00005JLIC,"""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" (MTM) is one of the most complete shows to emerge from American television. In the tradition of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""The Dick van Dyke Show,"" it was a comedy with the comedic aspects drawn not simply from real life, but ordinary life.

By most complete I mean shows that reflect insightfully the lives most of us end up living, regardless of what, at seventeen, we think our lives are sure to be. And so, pretty much by definition, that point of view eliminates the one-hour dramas that have ranged from ""Hill Street Blues"" to ""L. A. Law,"" from ""The West Wing"" and ""E.R."" to the ""CSI"" franchise. Eliminates them for the simple reason that real, ordinary life includes comedy. Real, ordinary life - if it has meaning at all - includes moments of honest, bonding laughter and not just ironic smirks from hardened cops, bloodied doctors or saavy politicos.

And by most complete I mean comedy that is found not by smashing apples into oranges (""My Favorite Martian,"" ""My Mother the Car,"" ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""Mork and Mindy,"" ""Third Rock From the Sun""), but by shifting the parallax of daily life just the slightest, at just the right point, to deliver the comedy, if not the absurdity, of human life on planet Earth.

""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" followed the classic template of all the preceding great sitcoms. In this template about a half dozen main characters form a genuine community. The adults in the community are of an age at which the dreams of their youth are gone (or are as completed as they're going to be), and have come to realize, accept and perhaps cherish the notion that with whom you work is just as important, if not more so, than what you do.

""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""The Dick van Dyke Show"" all accomplished this form within the context of the respective times for each show. (Please note that the family shows, ""Father Knows Best,"" ""The Donna Reed Show,"" ""Leave it to Beaver"" etc., are of a different form and so are part of a different discussion. Those shows focused on the home, and so again by definition cannot fully illustrate a complete life. The shows under discussion focused mainly on work in the larger world, and then on home life.)

The times that held the premier of MTM were very much different from the times of those earlier shows. Nineteen seventy, when MTM premiered, was far more different from 1960, when ""The Andy Griffith Show"" premiered, than was 1960 to 1951 when ""I Love Lucy"" premiered. The entire American landscape had changed in the decade between Andy and MTM. Rather than depict an eternally rosy life, the premise of MTM was downbeat - a life that had not worked out, a deliberate physical and emotional ripping away of that old life, a move to a new place with new people. (True, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" was premised on a dead wife and mother, but that fact was establsihed as well in the past with episode one. With episode one of MTM Mary's state of being is current, and will underlie the basic story line for the entire run of the show.)

Another MTM key was a lack of hyperbole; that is, ultra-exagerrated characters who would never exist in real life. Like Barney Fife, Ted Baxter is an exaggeration, but not to the point of Cosmo Kramer, or Harry from ""Third Rock ...."" This lack of cartoon-like characterization keeps open the window into the lives of people who worry about what we all do - money, health, being alone, fulfillment. Not that characters on other shows of any description don't have such worries. It's just that on the dramas they do it loudly and explicitly and on the slappy comedies they do it for a laugh and nothing more.

On MTM we see characters grapple with these weights as we all do - or would like to, anyway. At first alone, and then quuietly as we ask a friend to bear witness. Just as important, these troubles emerge, unstoppable, from the background. A remarkably poignant scene in MTM finds Mary and her father in her apartment. He is visiting from their hometown, the place that drove Mary to Minneapolis. Standing in the small apartment with the foldout couch he is in the midst of what his daughter's life now is. The last thing he wants to say is ""I told you so."" I don't think that is in his mind at all. He probably wants to say ""I'm sorry. I so wish everything might have worked out better for you."" But he doesn't. And Mary doesn't. There is nothing to say. Finally he asks, in an earnest tone unique to a father talking with his grown daughter, ""Are you happy?"" After a pause timed so perfectly, Mary answers honestly, if with the slightest reticence, ""Yes."" And we know she is. In the arithmetic of the ups and downs, of the good and bad, she is ... and in a way too many of us ache to be.

Because the comedy of MTM was just a hair's distance from the drama, it was comedy of the highest order. The funniest moments in life are not set up. (If a priest, a minister and a rabbi ever did walk into a bar together it wasn't funny.) We rarely see these moments coming as they simply flip a situation around, or upside down or inside out.

Just because the baby sitter is eleven doesn't stop her from saying to Bess, ""Hello, little girl, what's your name?"" Even the classic episode about the funeral of Chuckles the Clown was not an affected device - what else would eulogies for a clown be? And of course this edge of comedy - and the exhileration comedy denotes - was seen at the beginning of every episode. Who hasn't wondered who that scarf-wearing older woman is who is stunned, and possibly offended, by Mary Tyler Moore/Mary Richards as Mary/Mary twirls around downtown Minneapolis and tosses her hat in the sky?

The life of Mary Richrads was not just an American life, or a human life. It was a universal life, and by that I mean literally one sentient life - one single experience for better or worse - in the universe. Because it is the oldest of cliches, the one I'm about to use is the moldiest and smarmiest, and that doesn't matter. Cliches become cliches because they are true, and, yes, our lives are nothing without the lives of others. By deliberate calculation and hard work and just dumb luck (in the arts it's always all that together) James Brooks and Mary Tyler Moore created, in the life of mary Richards, one of the most memorable expressions of that cliche.",1189641600,12,6573,4.530749789385005
1456225,5,B00005JLIC,"I was too young to watch this originally on TV and still too young to appreciate the re-runs on Nick at Night but currently seem well enough aged to appreciate the show in box set form. A pre-cursor to Murphy Brown, Mary Richards moves to Minneapolis and gets a job as associate producer at a local news show. A bit reminiscent of the book Sex & The Single Girl, Mary deals with life as a single woman in her 30s trying to make her way on her own. I <3 Rhoda.",1182470400,,459,4.054945054945055

1456284,5,B00005JLIC,"I've always loved this show as is so often said about this show,very few sitcoms getting the cast and the writing spot on but this is a sitcom that certainly did.

The show and characters did change and evolve over its seven seasons,Ed Asner's Lou Grant in this first season,is almost like a wild animal yelling at everyone,from season 2 he became more sarcastic and would only yell when really mad,we saw him care for Mary like a daughter and in the last ever episode Lou is the one who says""I cherish you people!""

The pilot is cracking with new girl Mary settling into a new job and apartment in Minneapolis,she mets Rhoda Morgenstern(Valerie Harper)and renews a friendship with old friend Phyllis Lindstrom(the one and only Choris Leachman)

Like many people I loved the trio of Mary Rhoda and Phyllis,the latter two getting well deserved spinoffs,Rhoda's wisecracking always making up for the latest loser boyfriend she's attracted,Phyllis lording it over Mary and particularly Rhoda that she is married and they are not.

Ted Knight's Ted Baxter also changes in the first season,he comes over as well as being stupid,as vain and shallow but he gets more depth later by getting a girl friend Georgette and Ted got funnier and funnier.

Gavin MacLeod was always wisecracking as Murray,his total love for Mary very sweet.

In this first season the best episodes apart from the pilot are ""Support Your Local Mother"" when Nancy Walker makes her first appearance as

Ida,Rhoda's guilt dishing mother,""Toulese-Lautreeic Is One Of My Favourite Artists"" when Mary discovers she's a height bigot!

""Assistant Wanted Female"" when Phyllis gets a job at the newsroom as Mary's ""co-worker"" and causes chaos.

""Hi"" is another favourite when Miss Sunshine Mary has the roomate from hell when in hospital,a great guest appearance by Pat Carroll.

A good start to a classic sitcom.",1177459200,2,1869,5.0

1456286,5,B00005JLIC,"Sure, it's only four of the episodes from Season One, but the price is right and I was more than glad to add it to my DVD TV collection. The first episode is always stunning to watch as Mary moves to Minnesota to start her life over after leaving her boyfriend (who was a doctor that wouldn't commit to marriage). The interaction between Rhoda and Mary is fun and Rhoda comes off as a real angry person (fascinating how much/how fast her character changed) as Mary gets the apartment leaving Rhoda to stay in the attic apartment. The episodes are funny and it's great to watch Mary interact with the cast in that first episode.

Get the boxed DVD sets, but if you are wanting to add this inexpensive DVD of four great episodes of Season One you won't regret it.",1172793600,,761,4.397163120567376
1456287,5,B00005JLIC,"Although the show ran throughout the '70s, its appeal is still lasting today, in the story of Mary Richards and her eclectic co-workers in the WJM newsroom...

In the pilot, 30-year-old Mary has just moved to Minneapolis, eager to start a new life as a single careerwoman after her breakup with her fiance. She answers an ad seeking a secretary, and finds herself associate producer of the six o'clock news at WJM. There, she works for Lou Grant, a tough guy with a soft exterior and a ready bottle of booze, and alongside kindhearted news writer Murray and self-centered, idiotic reporter Ted Baxter.

On the home front, Mary decides to rent an apartment in the home of her college friend Phyllis Lindstrom...incurring the wrath of New York native Rhoda Morgenstern, who had her heart set on moving in. Despite their rocky start, the two opposite personalities quickly become best friends, creating the basis for much of the show's humor.

If you've never seen this show, I urge you to give it a try! You'll soon be looking for the rest of the seasons.",1164844800,,1053,4.743169398907104

1456289,5,B00005JLIC,"One of my favorite TV moments was when I was four years old and watching CBS Saturdays and looking forward to The MTM Show because the show was not completely over my head and I could laugh.  Most of the episodes on these DVDs I'm seeing for the first time because I was only one when the show came on the air, and I caught maybe two or three on Nick at Nite.  I enjoyed watching them far more than any of today's programs.  The show is about normal people and their normal lives and you will forget that the people in the show are actors.  There is humor in their lives and you are guaranteed to be entertained.  I feel like I got my money's worth and I plan to purchase the following seasons.

On a professional note, I live in Japan and have found this show to be of great use in an adult English language class.  Ted Baxter does require a bit of expaining, though.",1163030400,5,868,4.130952380952381

1456291,5,B00005JLIC,"In the golden years of Television - indeed in the golden years of Entertainment  - quality was important. Performers on TV had honed their skills, during years of endeavour in halls and theatres across the country, perfecting their work. Musicians - of all forms of music - played proper instruments with virtuoso ability. Lyrics could be understood and the musical sound replicated  - because it was written down and 'scored'. Actors, musicians, dancers, etc., all had 'great ability'.

Even in this milieu, some performers stood out as exceptional. When thoroughly competent TV directors and skilled television technicians were able to work with these outstanding performers, shows  of exceptional quality and were produced.

Mary Tyler Moore had an ability and an aura about her that was rare. The 'situation comedy', a long cherished and much loved TV art-form, seemed to have been made for her and her many skills. Moore's first great TV success was in the Dick Van Dyke Show. Then, when she starred in her own shows, Moore was magnificent.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show was produced and directd by consumate experts. Add to this a particularly high standing of casting, which ensured only the best supporting actors,and the Mary Tyler Moore Show was destined to be in the 'Top Flight' of its gendre.

Importantly however, unlike the crass and peurile content of so much 'entertainment' today, the Mary Tyler Moore Show ( and other great shows of the era) contained no gratuitous violence, no explicit sex or nudity, and no foul or blasphemous language. The show was humourous without being coarse and was, truly, a delight to watch.",1162684800,2,1635,5.033333333333333

A permanent tribute to an American icon. ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" stands as a landmark television series that debuted in the early 70's and ran for many many more seasons (I think 7 ). It was one of the first TV shows to do character comedy and America loved it; critics and public alike. This collection contains the pilot and the first season, audio commentry by several of the cast members and the co creator Allan Burns.

I searched high and low to find Season One after getting Seasons 2 and 3, and after watching all three of them, I can only imagine that Season 4 will be great also.

There was an odd quirk, though, with disc 2 in the MTM Volume 1 set.  My mom viewed it on her new Samsung DVD/VCR player (model 5500?).  But, it would not play the 1st show on disc 2.  Amazon graciously sent us a replacement, but the same thing happened with it.  I had no problem playing it on my cheap player at my home.  I took both copies of disc 2, to the store where I purchased it.  We played it through their identical Samsung display unit-same results as my mom's Samsung-it would not play the first show of disc 2!!  We also played it through a Toshiba and a Sylvania, and no problem at all.  So, there is something on Disc 2/1st episode that is incompatible with the Samsung 5500 model player-very strange!

It retailed for about $45.00 back then, but we both got it for about $34.99 back then. When it finally came in the later fall of 2002, I was a little disappointed to have it play only one episode at a time instead of the terrific PLAY ALL.

Nonetheless, it's a great show! Season 2 was supposed to come out on March 22, 2003, but never did~~ there was a web site you could go to in order to sign up for them to release further seasons. Season 2 didn't show up until this past June of 2005.

Now Season 3 has just been released as of January 17th 2006!

They are all SO CHEAP NOW!! About 1/2 the price on each DVD set.

But when the first season of MTM came out, there was not much for Television DVD sets as of yet. the ""I Love Lucy"" season one was being sold by volumes not the complete season. Even at Media Play there was just a small island of Television DVD sets. Then within a year or two, it just exploded!!!

So get 'em while they're cheap! Great fun, and such a classy show!

It holds up over the years real well!

I just wish they had the PLAY ALL button on their DVD set.

But I know that the Monkees DVD set has the play one episode at a time too.

Review of 3 different purchases September 2005. I use either of my

""Cyberhome 300 DVD"" players. All below are copyright protected, and you are unable to pick favorites to record on a DVD recorder. I Recommend all for content (good as you remember), but technical transcription could dissuade you.

1. Andy Griffith Show - complete seasons 1 to 3 - Well packaged, great video, plays from ""play all"" or by individual shows - single sided with a graphic of number of disc on each side; has some original commercials that played as separate features. By Paramount.

2. Bob Newhart Show - complete 1st season - double sided, will ""play all"" (memory), with 1/64"" disc name on one side in the inner DVD non data ring. I can't read it. I added pen number on inner ring but shows through the other side of the translucent disc. Not for DVD changers. Noted some skips, stalls, and fry's on some episodes. By 20th Century.

3. Mary Tyler Moore Show - complete first season - Single sided - nice folded holder with printed insert of episodes. Numbered discs full size. No ""play all"". To play you must go to the episode, then chapter, then play, after which it stops, shows the chapter, you scroll back up to the menu, then scroll down to the next program. Some grief to me.  By 20th Century.

I  Like the ""play all"" feature  - which probable most of future makers will have - you watch - say two episodes, turn off the DVD, the next occasion  the DVD player is turned on, it  starts with the third one (assuming you didn't eject the disc). Etc. Two hour movie features don't need this feature, they have chapters.

I purchased all from Amazon for the value and ease.  #1. Was first and I was enthralled - #2.  I read a previous review and understood the double sided complaint, but if the print on the discs was any smaller, a microscope would help (play the silver side, or the silver side with the tiny brown band next). #3. - Bummer to back scroll only to forward two scrolls to press play to see the next 23 minute show, then do it again - sleepy - relaxing - Bummer.

All are content worthy considering today's sitcoms, and I laugh loudly again enjoying any of the DVD's.

Keep Happy,

1456382,3,B00005JLIC,"Nearly everything about this release is superb: picture quality, sound quality, format, and extras.  What I cannot understand is why these episodes are EDITED!!  The cuts are skilfully done, but are done nonetheless.  In the closing credits, while the credits roll over scenes from the episode that has just been shown, there are scenes that do not appear in the episode as presented on these discs.  Why are these cuts made?  Why are the episodes not presented as they were originally aired?!  I thought that this series would be presented in its original form, and not edited in the same manner that one sees on cable television.  Can anybody answer the question as to why cuts are made?  I fully expected unedited episodes, and I feel cheated!!  WHY ARE THE EPISODES OF TELEVISION SERIES, AS RELEASED ON DVD, EDITED??!!!",1133308800,30,823,4.863309352517986

The first scene is Mary arriving at her new apartment opening the curtains and there's Rhoda cleaning the windows.  While Phylis is introduced as her close friend, we all know that Rhoda will be her best friend.

The next scene is the job interview which of course is a classic.  Mary answering Lou's questions one question late. Of course the scene ends with the classic line by Lou ""you got spunk, (Mary smiles) I hate spunk!"" (Another piece of trivia - Mary applies for a secretary job which Lou already filled.  But where was this secretary on the show?)

Of course at work the cast of characters at work is just as diverse as home. Lou the gruff but loveable boss. Ted the incompetent newscaster, who thinks the only newscater that is better than him was Walter Cronkite. Gordy, the competent weatherman. And her soul mate Murray, the writer who has to find ways to write news that Ted can't flub.

This show evenly balances her home life with her work life.  Some episodes are primarily at the apartment with Rhoda and Phyliss, some are primarily at work with Lou, Murray and Ted, and some combine both.

The following are the key episodes:

1. Love is All Around (Pilot) - see above

3. Bess You is My Daughter Now - This is a send up the ""modern parenting techniques"".  Mary babysits Phylis' daughter Bess and Bess prefers Mary to Phylis.

6. Support Your Local Mother - This introduces Ida Morgenstern (Nancy Walker) as Rhoda's mother.  They were smart keeping Walker around for the Rhoda spinoff!  (Trivia #3: They refer to Rhoda having two sisters and a bother)(Emmy Award Best Writing)

7. Toulouse-Latrec is one of My Favorite Arists - Mary fills in for Ted during a taping of an interview show and falls for the guest until she finds out that he's a foot shorter than her.  Of course Mary is afraid to admit that this is an issue and dates him. (Funny scene when the program airs and Ted is inserted over Mary, they keep in the guest asking Mary out.)(Emmy Award Best Direction)

9. Bob and Rhoda and Teddy and Mary - This is the first of a almost annual show, The Teddy Awards or The Teddy Awards disaster.

17. Second-Story Story - Mary is burglarized (and Phlyis helped).

24. The Forty Five Year Old Man - Lou is fired and Mary goes to the station owner Wild Jack Monroe (Everyone assumes that is what WJM stands for but it is never stated in the episode) to get Lou back.

Extra Features:

Documentary on the Mary Tyler Moore Show including interviews with everyone but Mary?

All-Star Trivia Challange - Questions asked by cast members, producers, writers and directors (I got a perfect score!)

Ed Asner and Valerie Harper's Emmy Award Speaches.

1456385,5,B00005JLIC,"As a fan of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, I had wanted to buy this First Season set for some time, but had been hesitant due to some other bad TV-to-DVD sets that I had seen and heard about.  I took a chance and bought this one, and I couldn't have been more delighted with it.  The sound and picture are tremendous (a BIG improvement over the videotape set that was released several years ago) and the special features are above and beyond anything I've yet seen on other TV series DVDs.  And don't get me started on what a superb value this set is - you won't find another collection with so many extras for such a great price. If you're a TV comedy fan, do yourself a huge favor and buy this set...I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  Kudos to the folks at Twentieth Century Fox for doing such a fantastic job, and here's hoping they keep it up for the remaining seasons!",1125273600,6,874,4.278787878787878

Mary Tyler Moore was like my mentor as I was in my teens and on my way to becoming an adult.  She looks as good then as she does now.  To me, it's like my Sex & The City of the 70s.

I would highly recommend buying ALL the MTM show DVDs since TV Land or NickAtNite doesn't seem to want to bring her back on their line up.  That is why I am hoping all of the seasons will come out on DVD.  I enjoy the show for its comedy, characters, and fashion!",1123545600,2,550,3.8660714285714284

1456448,5,B00005JLIC,"""The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete First Season"" is a fantastic DVD boxed set in every respect! The packaging for this 4-Disc set is a cut above, and quite sturdy. The inner case is very cleverly done, with each disc (plus the artwork on the case underneath) spelling out a letter in M-A-R-Y. Nice, eye-appealing packaging design.

A nice (non-animated) DVD Menu design here as well. We get a lot of chapter stops with this set too. Each of the 24 first-season episodes is broken into TEN chapters!

I'm certainly no expert, but it sure seems to me that whoever put this set together did a bang-up job on the transfer. The images look very smooth and clear, and the colors are incredibly vibrant. Color explodes everywhere! For example, the first episode...very first scene...Phyllis' outfit is alive with gorgeous colors. TMTMS is a great program for showcasing the psychedelic colors in the clothes worn in the decade of the '70s. And on DVD they've never looked better.

Every little detail stands out vividly on the DVD. Take a look at Mary's couch (you can almost FEEL the fabric)....or Lou's desk (and how the pattern of the wood grain is so clearly evident). These little things, that a person would probably not notice on the VHS, sure stand out on the DVD. It's like watching all these great MTM episodes for the first time.

The first episode of MTM (""Love Is All Around"") is about as good as a sitcom episode gets! There's the inevitable humor (natch)....but we also seem to be getting ""invited"" right on into Mary's home and workplace. It's kinda hard to put your finger on just what quality it contains, but it's there (for me anyway). A personal experience. The writers are so good (right off the bat) at making us care about each character. From Mary, right down the line, even the pompous Ted Baxter. In the hands of different writers, Ted would be ever-so-easily disliked. But, in TMTMS, he's just the opposite. You can't help but like him, despite his ""Look at me--I'm God"" attitude.

Other favorites from MTM-Season 1 include the outstanding Christmas episode (even though a portion of Mary's rendition of ""White Christmas"" had to be omitted from this DVD release due to [I think] legal rights for the song) and ""1040 Or Fight"", which has Mary being audited by the IRS. Actor Paul Sand (who is featured in an Audio Commentary Track for this episode) plays the timid and thoroughly likeable ""Robert C. Brand"" in this ultra-charming program, that warrants repeated viewings.

""Robert C."" starts to fall for Mary while performing his auditing tasks -- and who could blame him? There's a nice chemistry between Mary and Paul/Robert in this episode, which ranks as one of my Top 10 MTM eps. in the history of the series.

Just listen to the overwhelming relief in Mary's voice when she discovers at the end of ""1040 Or Fight"" that she owes only ""sixteen ... dollars"" on her taxes. A perfect piece of acting as she says those two words in such a ""weight-off-my-shoulders"" manner that even as viewers we breathe a sigh of relief, right along with Mary. :-)

""1040 Or Fight"" is also noteworthy for Rhoda's hilarious line of dialogue --- ""I don't know why I bother putting this candy in my mouth; I might just as well apply it directly to my hips."" (ROFL!)

Bonus Material on Disc #4 includes:

>> A fabulous 87-minute ""Making Of"" documentary, featuring lots of great insights into the making of the series via cast and crew interviews.

>> Audio Commentary Tracks for 3 episodes -- including an Ed Asner commentary for the series'  debut show.

>> Emmy Awards clips (from 1971).

>> Original CBS-TV Promos.

>> An ""All-Star Trivia Challenge"" (questions that are posed by the ""cast and creative team of the show"").

>> A small Photo Gallery.

""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" shall forever remain one of the very best sitcoms in the history of television (IMO). And being able to re-visit Season One time and again via this stellar 4-Disc DVD set is something that every fan of Mary's series should be grateful for.",1122595200,9,4719,4.793827160493827
1456449,5,B00005JLIC,"To this day, The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season DVD along with The Dick Van Dyke Show DVDs are regarded as ""cream of the crop"" in terms of both quality and quantity in their packaging. Until recently, the sets were also notorious for their high price tags. Today (three years later) the set is now reasonably affordable. About time, Fox.

During the three years of waiting for the set's price to fall I kept tabs on the rave customer reviews over the picture and overall quality of the show. Having just recently completed the entire set, I'm glad to report that all of the praise is well-deserved. I'd forgotten just how funny and brilliantly structured the episodes were. Tons of great dialogue delivered by a talented & cohesive ensemble cast. So much talent in the cast that you'll be thinking about the DVDs for the spin-offs (Rhoda, Lou Grant, Phyllis) and other memorable ""future shows"" (Too Close For Comfort, The Love Boat) the stars would later go on to.

The extras for this set are just as cool as the episodes themselves. Going thru them all was enjoyably satisfying, and not a ""chore"" as it can be sometimes with some other DVDs. Special Features include an all-new 87-minute ""Making of Season One"" documentary with exclusive cast and crew interviews, selected episode commentaries, Emmy Award show clips, trivia challenge, still gallery and more! Overall, this is a DVD set that truly lives up to its hype, a must for your TV DVD collection.

1456451,5,B00005JLIC,"The Mary Tyler Moore Show is a classic. This is the first season of the show on DVD.

You get the 24 episodes from Season One on Disks 1, 2, and 3. Three of the episodes have commentarys, I can't remember which though.

Disk 4 has plenty of extras, but the best of them all is 'The Making Of The Mary Tyler Moore Show' which is 88 minutes long.

The show is about Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore). The first episode we see her get a job at the WJM-TV news station. From there we see her make new friends (Rhoda, and Phyllis), and manage her job.

Her manager at the station is Lou Grant (Ed Asner), who has no sympathy for people, and keeps a drink in his desk at all times.

Mary also works for the ego-eccentric Ted Baxter (Ted Knight). Ted thinks mainly about himself. He believes he is the best news caster out there, but sadly he's far from that.

Murray also works with Mary, and is a little more tolerable. In the first episodes he seems to be mean and cranky. But as the show moves on, Murray changes, and has a big heart.

Mary's best friends Rhoda and Phllis are so different it's amazing. Phyllis is all about following the books, and being in order. Rhoda just comes and gos as she pleases, and has a lot of sarcasm, but Rhoda is just like the most of us.

The first season of this show is different from the later seasons. Each season got better and better starting with this!

I highly recommend this! The money is really worth it!

1456540,5,B00005JLIC,"In a recent effort to get casual fans interested in their TV products on DVD, Fox has released four episode starter sets of several of their shows.  Reasonably priced, they tempt the viewer to buy the first season and even provide a coupon for the purchase price of the sampler off the price of the complete first season if offered.  The casual fan has little to loose.

And this set offers four of the funniest episodes from the first season of The Mary Tyler Moore Show.  ""Love is All Around"" is one of my favorite TV pilots ever, expertly introducing us to the characters we'd grow to love as the series progressed.

""Support Your Local Mother"" brings Rhoda's Mom for a visit.  With Mary as her host, Mary begins to see why Rhoda has a hard time dealing with her mother.

""Toulouse-Lautrec Is One of My Favorite Artists"" finds Mary confronting the realization that she's a height bigot when a charming but shorter man asks her out.

""The Snow Must Go On"" places Mary in charge of election night coverage.  Vowing they won't go off the air until they get final results, Mary must keep Ted going when they are cut off from any source of news.

Of course, the problem with this disc is that any fan of the show has had two and a half years to get the complete first season by now.  But if you are a casual fan, this disc will give you four top notch episodes from the first season of this classic sit-com.",1112486400,13,1405,4.365384615384615

What happened??,1112227200,,349,4.223880597014926
1456542,5,B00005JLIC,"This is a review I should have written long ago.  Not only is The Mary Tyler Moore Show one of the very best - and probably the most beloved - situation comedy of all-time, this Season One collection is one of the best television DVD box sets on the market.  The fact that Fox really did Season One right made it all the more unfortunate that plans for Season Two were shelved for so long - now, though, I can write this review with all the delight I can muster, knowing that the long-awaited Season Two set is finally set for release.  It will have a hard time topping this one, but the important thing is that it and the remaining five seasons of the show are released because, as an online petition made clear, we want our Mary.

I really don't know how anybody cannot love this show.  Mary, Lou, Murray, Ted, Rhoda, Phyllis - these are characters we all know and love (OK - I'll admit Phyllis is hard to love).  This show was just one classic moment after another, right from the start of the very first episode.  Each half hour was a guaranteed good time with good friends.  I was late for the premiere, not coming into the world until the night of the third episode, so I can't really speak from experience about how different and ground-breaking a show this was back in 1970; as a matter of fact, I didn't really like the show when I was very young - proving just how dumb little kids can be.  Looking back now, though, it's impossible not to view this show as a real product of the 1970s.  Here, in Mary Richards, was a new kind of female character - a single, independent thirty-year-old woman making it on her own in what had traditionally been a man's world.  At its heart, the show was all about the life of a young professional, single woman in a new, feminist era - yet the show was not overtly feminist.  Heck, Mary Richards was exactly the kind of woman any man in his right mind would want to marry.  I also have to note the fact that Mary was the only woman I know of who always looked good in the fashion debacle that was the 1970s.  Then there was Rhoda, an altogether different kind of new woman.  Lou Grant, of course, is a product of traditional thinking, but even he proves flexible - in his own grouchy way - of adjusting to change.  I could go on and on about these characters: good old Murray, Ted Baxter, even Gordy the weatherman.  Ted Knight was nothing short of brilliant in his portrayal of the one-and-only Ted Baxter.

In many ways, the show's first season was my favorite.  The original cast gelled instantly, Mary was at her perkiest, and the opening montage and music were perfect - the show's opening changed a little bit from one season to the next.  Sonny Curtis' Love Is All Around was the perfect theme song, and the hat toss at the end became an instant cultural icon.  Not only do you get all 24 shows from that magical first season in this DVD box set, you get all kinds of great extras: commentary on select episodes, an MTM trivia challenge (a piece of cake for us true fans), a still gallery of images related to the show's first season, clips from the Emmy Awards of 1971 (where Ed Asner and Valerie Harper took home awards for best supporting actor and actress in a comedy series, James L. Brooks and Allan Burns won for outstanding writing achievement in a comedy - for an episode CBS adamantly opposed making, and Jay Sandrich won for outstanding directorial achievement in a comedy) - not bad for a show that the clueless suits at CBS absolutely hated in the beginning.  That leads me to the spectacular 90-minute documentary from 2002 that is included in this collection.  It is an incredibly informative, entertaining look back at the show by almost everyone involved in its creation (only one of the writers, Lorenzo Music, and of course the great Ted Knight were no longer with us at that time).  It's really a remarkable story, one that really reinforces the wonderful affinity everyone on this series enjoyed with one another.  It's almost impossible to believe some of the problems the show faced in pre-production, especially the disastrous first live run on what became known as Black Tuesday - and who could have guessed that Gavin MacLeod initially read for the part of Lou Grant, or that CBS did all it could to get Ed Asner replaced?

Basically, what I am trying to say is that this Season One set was and is a dream come true for all of us MTM fans.  If you care anything at all about quality television at its best, you will add The Mary Tyler Moore Show Season One to your personal collection.",1111968000,6,4562,4.432335329341317

1456544,5,B00005JLIC,"On March 22, 2005, Fox Home Entertainment released this ""TV Starter Set"" DVD consisting of four of the best episodes from Season #1 of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". This one-disc ""Starter"" Pack is nice for those people who are not at all familiar with the MTM Show (and would just like to see a ""sample"" from the series), or for those who are already fans of Mary's show, but don't want to dig too deep into their pocketbooks and purchase the full-season, 24-episode DVD boxed set of the first MTM season, which is a compilation which also earns a perfect ""Five-Star"" rating from this writer.

Unlike the deluxe 4-Disc ""Complete First Season"" DVD set of ""TMTMS"", there aren't any special bonus features on this ""Starter"" disc -- just the four episodes (listed below). But it's still a very good deal, IMO, at the bargain price offered.

The video quality for these four stellar MTM episodes is simply SUPERB! I doubt these shows could look any better. The colors are perfect and vibrant and there's no annoying video ""noise"" or artifacts (that I can detect at any rate).

Each episode here gets its own ""Chapter"" sub-menu on the disc, with 10 chapter stops per show! Video is presented in the original TV ratio of 1.33:1; the audio sounds just fine via the disc's English Dolby Digital soundtrack (of the 2.0 Mono variety). There are even two foreign-language tracks included (in Spanish 2.0 Mono and French 2.0 Mono); plus Subtitles in English and Spanish. Unfortunately, there is not a ""Play All"" feature included.

There's also a very short ""Mary Tyler Moore TV Spot"" included on this disc. This is not an original 1970 CBS-TV promo for TMTMS, however. It's a brief 15-second ad pitching the 4-Disc ""Complete First Season"" set of The MTM Show.

A 12-page insert (DVD advertising booklet) also comes with this Starter Set, featuring many ads for other FOX TV-On-DVD products.

Here's a glance at the four episodes that make up this ""MTM Starter Set"" (with original CBS-TV Air Dates in parenthesis)............

1.) ""Love Is All Around"" (09/19/1970)
2.) ""Support Your Local Mother"" (10/24/1970)
3.) ""Toulouse-Lautrec Is One Of My Favorite Artists"" (10/31/1970)
4.) ""The Snow Must Go On"" (11/7/1970)

""Love Is All Around"" is the debut episode of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", and does a great job of introducing the viewing audience to ""Mary Richards"", ""Rhoda Morgenstern"", ""Phyllis Lyndstrom"", ""Lou Grant"", ""Murray Slaughter"", and ""Ted Baxter"".

Everybody in this series was first-rate all the way, with the show picking up more steam as the first season progressed; and it got even better in Season #2.

""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was one of the most popular and successful TV comedy series ever aired on network television, accumulating an amazing 67 Emmy nominations during its seven-year period on the airwaves (1970 to 1977). The series won 29 total Emmy Awards, including four during its rookie season.

For someone, (like myself) who has never seen the series and is curious about it, this idea is a godsend. I would be very reluctant to buy an expensive whole season set of something I have never seen previously on TV. This way I can spend a small amount of money and decide if I like the series. The fact that Amazon is offering this money back if I buy the full series makes it a no loose offer.

Because FOX had not promoted MTM: Season One and was asking lots of money, the DVD sales were slower than expected in 2002. Rumors now circulate that Season 2 will eventually be released, but I have to question the genius of including a coupon for the Season 1 release inside this specific package.

If people who are happy to have this starter set then already have all the Mary Tyler Moore which they want and series fans will buy the complete season releases anyways, the 'starter set' concept will not serve as a 'bridge' to increasing overall MTM DVD interest. Casual fans are not going to buy additional DVDs for something which they found only mildly interesting.

Barring the VERY unusual and isolated case, people are not going to first buy this release and then the traditional DVD set. Since those people do not make up a market majority, I am curious how FOX believed this approach would power overall series sales.

I could see the starter set in the mid 1990's or only selected episodes being released in lieu of entire seasons. I must question the relevancy of that strategy in 2005 and also in addition to full season releases of a series.",1109635200,4,1303,4.627705627705628

In 2002, MTM must have been one of the first series released on DVD.  Maybe the newness of the idea of collecting series on DVD had not caught on yet.  Or maybe the $50 price tag was seen as high back then.

I'm so sorry that you have the ability to release this show, because we all know you're too f'en stupid to actually invest time or effort in quality TV shows, whether they were produced in the 1970s or in the 2000s.

I'm sorry also that you think satisfying the majority of the population who actually seem to accept reality shows as entertainment is good enough.

You have a jewel, and you are letting it fade by not releasing it. Please, just release the rest of the series - and I'm not saying season two alone, but ALL of them. If necessary, release World's Stupidest Cop Chases Volumes 12-27 simultaneously so that no one begins to suspect that you have any decent amount of taste.

It was one of the top sitcoms of all time. It produced spinoffs: Rhoda, Phyllis and Lou Grant.

When MTM Fist Season came out, the shelves were well stocked with this box set and now it is difficult to find a retail outlet with this box set in stock, which means FOX cannot sell more if they are not available in stores for consumers to purchase.  Therefore, it cannot be because of lack of sales why Season 2, of this multiple Emmy winning classic, has not been released.

I too have been patiently waiting for Season 2 to come out, and have become frustrated wondering when it will.  Hopefully, if enough MTM and classic TV fans will bond together, sending a message to FOX for discriminating and/or ignoring this market,  maybe they will see the light and do the right thing.

I wish that Fox would re-consider releasing subsequent volumes of the show, at a price close to what they've been asking for series such as ""M*A*S*H."" I can't help but feel that they would see a big increase in sales, and not simply because of a price reduction. ""Mary Tyler Moore"" is one of those rare series that actually improved in quality in later seasons...and now it looks as if we'll never be able to enjoy some of those wonderful later episodes on DVD, not to mention superb characters that were added during those later seasons, such as Sue Ann Nivens.

Fox, please reconsider and give it a try. The first season has some wonderfully memorable episodes and I'm grateful to have them on DVD--but the first season is not ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" at its peak.",1105228800,42,1177,4.764705882352941

Surely the integrity of a company lies in its patrons being able to depend on the information they receive from it.  Naturally, if this were an issue of financial loss I could understand.  However, there is clearly a large demand for subsequent seasons.

I don't want to speculate on political issues here.  Let's just conclude with a very simple lesson in economics:

Well, that was over two years ago, and not only has season two on DVD never seen the light of day, but neither have the other five seasons which should have already been out by now. This is an abomination! Clearly one of the most classic series ever, it is a disgrace that the other seasons have not been briskly delivered, when shows like ""Punky Brewster"" and ""Gilligan's Island"" are covering store racks.

This set here, the first, is without a doubt one of the best TV series DVD sets I have seen. The shows are all masterfully remastered, with gorgeous crisp picture and sound. It is a totally different experience watching these on disc then the muddy, faded prints that have been running on TV, in syndication for years. The extras are also a pleasure, and the making-of documentary is impressive (and they just cover the first season!).

There is no question that this is in the top five best sitcoms ever, and that the rest of the series needs to be on DVD...pronto! I heard a rumor about the second season being released in two parts...to lower the cost. Pathetic. If that's the case, I think another studio should have been releasing this series to disc. With shows having the same number of episodes per season being released today, in the $30-40 range, I don't think it's necessary to do that.

I have watched the disgust and disbelief of customer who have been disappointed by Fox's refusal to release any further season. I am not surprised. Fox unlike MTM is not what you would call a classy network. Hell it makes WJM-TV look first class. They churn out trash and make shows that appeal to the publics lowest and basest instincts. Fox you have witheld my memories and witheld my friends from me...because after seven seasons thats what Mary,Rhoda, Lou and all the gang were. It seems incomprehensible to me that we are now seeing season two released of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" & ""Gilligans Island"" and this series languishes in a vault ignored. From a Television history point of view alone this series deserves to be on disc....but I guess money will always truimph over what is deserving.

I'm a huge fan of Nick at Nite and TV Land which is where I originally first saw the show and I really enjoyed the special cast, characters, episodes, moments, & memories from The Mary Tyler Moore Show. This first season is an instant smash hit! It by far has one of the best cast's ever developed for television and what ended up coming to be a part of TV history. Such stars are: Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Asner, Gavin MacLeod, Valerie Harper, Ted Knight, & Cloris Leachman. The time that the TV Show came out it was a luck of the draw for an independent woman type of show. However, I believe it's not only for women, but for everyone to enjoy. The network back at the time surely did take a risk and I'm very glad they did indeed and made it work. For those who are not familiar at all with the show please do take a risk. You won't be sorry you'll enjoy all of the episodes from season one. My favorite's include: Love Is All Around, Bess, You Is My Daughter Now, Divorce Isn't Everything, Support Your Local Mother, The Snow Must Go On, Second Story Story, Hi, A Friend in Deed, & Smokey The Bear Wants You.

The Mary Tyler Moore show also had a wonderful supportive guest star's and also stemmed talent into today's generation. The comedy is at it's best and it's extremely fresh in a classic way. Plus, I think you can find yourself relating to either all of the characters or at least some of them.

The DVD is very neat with all of the extra goodies. It has a few commentary's by the cast, a wonderful behind the scene's of the shows creation, and my favorite the trivia game.

1456698,5,B00005JLIC,"The season 1 DVD of ""Mary Tyler Moore"" was terrific. But don't kid yourselves about Fox's dilly-dallying around in releasing season 2 (or subsequent years) of the show being about ""disappointing sales"" of S1: with a 35 year old show, they don't expect gang-buster sales, and they never get them, yet old shows are released en masse all the time nonetheless... The failure to turn-out season 2 (and beyond) of ""MTM"" is purely a  political thing we don't know the inside details about.
(And FOX has not been quick to put much of any of the MTM Enterprises library out on DVD, have they?)

As far as them doling out season 2 in a two-volume set? Look... I love ""Mary"" as much as anybody out there, but this is treating us like children. (And now, Fox representatives are talking as if they can't even remember the extras that Ed Asner's son, Matthew, produced a couple of years ago for the S2 DVD release... Baloney!) We're not talking about a new, multi-million dollar theatrical film release, folks....
I hate to say this, because I want ""Mary"", too, but I say, ""dont even bother"" until FOX stops playing games and gets their in-house situation cleared up, especially regarding the MTM library.

It's insulting to fans, and the 'explanations' are invalid, illogical and not factual.

But thank goodness for the amazing trend of TV shows coming into DVD, younger generations can now see all these wonderful shows. I fell in love with MAry Tyler Moore the moment I saw her in the very first episode, isn't she just one of the most appealing actresses ever! Just like Audrey Hepburn it's impossible to hate her. She is THE Girl Next Door of the Girl Next Doors.

Some of my favorite episodes are of course The Pilot (which is I think one of the best pilots of any sitcom), Today I'm a Maam, Support Your Local Mother, Toulouse-Lautrec Is One of My Favorite Artists, Second-Story Story, and 1040 or Fight to name a few.

MTMS has one of the best ensemble ever. I especially love Valerie Harper, her timing was spot on and seeing her now older she is just more beautiful than ever. She is totally aging gracefully. Ted Knight was just a riot. The dumbness of Woody Cheers) and Joey (Friends) can be traced to Ted Knight who mastered dumbness perfectly. Of course Cloris Leachman was always a delight to see. She was just hilarious. I love when she say things out of the blue or when she says unfunny stuffs that she thinks is funny.

I just hope season 2 would be available soon. It would be a total shame if money is the reason for not releasing it.

14. Christmas and the Hard Luck Kid-Mary has to work on Christmas all alone.

I really don't think that even needs to be said, that's something we all know, and I think that's why we will probably see Fox change their decision on releasing the remaining seasons, if it is, in fact, in Fox's hands. It's hard to tell what could delay the release of a show of this stature and quality. Certainly they would have to know that there is a demand for it. I think if we're patient, eventually we will get the remaining episodes from this series.
  This sort of makes me think of the Badfinger skirmish back in the 70's and 80's. Their music was suddenly pulled from release for legal reasons while the demand was still high. The price for a Badfinger album went through the roof because there was no new product available. After probably close to 20 years everything was settled and their material was released on CD. I'm not implying that this might be the case here, but the demand was eventually satisfied. I think we'll eventually see that in this instance too, but it may be a while.

1456767,5,B00005JLIC,"The 1960's and 1970's truly were the golden age of television. The Mary Tyler Moore Show is certainly a shining emblem of the era. Premiering in 1970, I do remember some of the original airings as a 3 year old child. Of course, not many 3 year olds can understand or appreciate the comedic qualities of this show! Now, as an adult, I am thrilled to own the first season, and hope the second season follows soon!
Moore stars as Mary Richards, a young woman who relocates to Minneapolis following a broken engagement. Richards moves into a one-room apartment in a building with some interesting neighbors, feisty Rhoda Morganstern, played by Valerie Harper, and daffy Phyllis Lindstrom, played by the very sexy Cloris Leachman.
Richards gains employment as an associate news producer at WJM-TV, working for the grouchy but likable Lou Grant, played by Ed Asner, who is simply perfect in his role.
The comedy pool draws from the everyday work experiences of the characters, and the hopeless love lives of the single female characters. Oh, yes, let's not forget Mary's dull house parties!
Some of the episodes have commentary from production personnel in a separate audio track. As one of the producers points out, Moore is such a talented and generous actress that she does not attempt to corner all the laughs and attention. Indeed, the MTM show bred three spinoffs of moderate success: ""Rhoda,"" ""Phyllis,"" and ""Lou Grant."" Moore's ability and willingness to allow the other actors to strongly develop their roles certainly contributed to this.
Gavin MacLeod, who played newswriter Murray Slaughter, went on to a successful role on ""The Love Boat."" Ted Knight, who played the inept anchorman, Ted Baxter, is fabulous, despite having had a limited acting career, mostly as a TV character actor.
Most of the minor actors on the show turn out a quality performance. John Amos appears fairly regularly as Gordy Howard, WJM's meteorologist.
All in all, this is 100% a top quality, funny, entertaining program. The DVD picture and sound quality are excellent, too.",1060214400,2,2056,4.997084548104956
1456768,5,B00005JLIC,"CBS's comedy lineup in the late 60's was doing well in the ratings, led by rural based programs like The Beverly Hillbillies.  But the winds of change were blowing, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show (MTM) was part of CBS's bid to gain a younger audience.  Surrounded by a relatively unknown cast, Mary Tyler Moore returned to TV in 1970, after previously staring in the Dick Van Dyke Show.  Her new program, like Van Dyke's, was low-key, warm, and built on solid writing, and character development.
Mary Richards was an unmarried, independent woman, making her way in the world.  Fortunately, as the song says, ""love is all around"", and Mary finds a new home in Minneapolis, as a producer at WJM TV.  Rather than being hard, and fiercely independent, Mary was just a big hearted ""softie"", often too willing to sacrifice herself for others.  In doing so, she and the rest of the cast, found a place in the hearts of millions of viewers.
The first season featured fine performances by guest stars like Monte Markum, John Shuck, Pat Carroll, Shelly Berman, Slim Pickens, and Nancy Walker as Rhoda's mother.  You also get an interesting look at fashion in the 70's.  Mary's wardrobe, is of course in the spotlight, but Rhoda, and Phyllis also provide some interesting looks as well.  Though it's hard to top Mary's pink nightgown, in the episode entitled ""Hi!"".
The four DVD MTM set is a comprehensive package containing the 24 episodes arranged in broadcast order, with eight episodes per disc.  Commentary tracks on a few more episodes would have been nice.  The fourth disc contains extensive bonus material, primarily a comprehensive 87 minute retrospective feature that centers on the show's creative team of Allan Burns, and James L. Brooks.  It has interviews with Mary, and the rest of the primary cast, and members of the production staff.  The insight provided is tremendous, particularly the stories about how the various characters were cast.  A feature like this, adds so much to the package, and brings the experience of the show, full circle.  Produced by Ed Asner, it shows appreciation to the fans, and pays tribute to a classic program.  Too bad we don't see a feature like this more often in boxed sets.
MTM occupies a special place in TV history, and provided a tremendous boost to the careers of so many of its cast, and launched several spin-offs as well.  This set is essential for MTM fans, as well as those who appreciate classy, well-written comedy.  Unfortunately the release of Season Two has failed to materialize as advertised.",1060214400,2,2549,4.84757505773672

I'm serious folks all of these episodes are great, the cast settled in very fast. Can you believe CBS almost didn't do the show, they didn't have confidence in it's producers/writers James L. Brooks and Allan Burns. Many of the shows were directed by Jay Sandrich and Alan Rafkin who brought out the best in this cast. One very important note, these shows are roughly 24 1/2 to 25 minutes long so if like me, you taped them from TV you will notice they are sometimes as much as 3 minutes shorter than the ones presented on these DVDs. They are edited on TV to squeeze in more commercials. Shame on you. I watched this show when it originally aired in 1970, I'm 45. A must DVD set for any fan, complete, unedited and clearer picture than ever before, like watching them anew. I have vague memories of the episodes I saw from it's original air date.

1456841,5,B00005JLIC,"The Mary Tyler Moore show is considered one of the finest productions in the history of television. The acting, directing and writing are all samples of the craft at its peak. Popular shows of the last few decades since MTM like Seinfeld, and Friends are good shows in their own right but are not even in the same class as the Mary Tyler Moore Show. The show was and is that good. The character interactions, relationships and issues of the show are just as relevant now as they were back in 1970. You can tell the actors really enjoyed working together and genuinely cared for each other by their performances.

Now 20th Century Fox has released the first season 1970-71 (24 episodes) on DVD. The DVD is a wonderful example of a show treated with the care and respect it deserves. The packaging, DVD menu screens and the printed inserts are all first rate.  The first 3 discs are the episodes (3 episodes have on/off commentary by the directors)of the show and the fourth disc is a special features disc of Season One including Emmy Award clips and an 87 minute making of the show documentary.
I would highly recommend the MTM show and DVD release to anyone as this show is an example of TV at its very best. I can't wait for season 2 to be released.",1051920000,9,1251,4.458515283842795
1456842,5,B00005JLIC,"If you enjoy shows like ""Friends"", ""Seinfeld"", and ""Frasier"", you have got to check out this DVD.  I shouldn't even have to put it in those terms - if you never seen this series, you're either really young or comatose - in either event, see what you've been missing.
One of the things that I usually dislike about older series on DVD is that 1)they don't care about restoring quality, and 2)there are no extras.  That is not a problem here.
* I've many many retrospectives on how MTM finally got to air, and they are all great.  The one here is no exception (beware - the accompanying music is annoying)
* The creative team behind the show (Brooks, Burns, Sandrich, etc) are present and even provide commentary for some episodes - a rarity.
* The episodes look remarkably preserved - like they could run on network television now (the videotaped versions released previously didn't look as good).  I didn't even notice that they aren't in stereo (sure, Mary's clothes can be dated, but that's it - and only rarely)
* The original 1970 promos and Emmy footage - GREAT ADDED BONUS (I love that kind of ""retro"" stuff)
* The episodes are UNCUT - no extra TVLand ""cuts"" for extra commercials, allowing for ""throwaway"" moments that really are gems.
I cannot recommend this DVD more highly.  This show deserves to be a classic, and must be seen in DVD format to be truly appreciated.",1051920000,6,1376,4.6

1456844,5,B00005JLIC,"How excited I was to hear MARY TYLER MOORE: THE FIRST SEASON was being released on DVD.  And I was not disappointed.  I have grown up on MTM reruns, since I was too young to remember it's original run, and I have never tired of Mary, Lou, Murray, Ted, Rhoda and the gang.  True genius, and a classic sitcom that never goes out of style.  Once you get over the shocking plunge back into the fashions and attitudes of 1970, it doesn't take long before the abiding charm and real skill that made the ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" a massive hit overwhelms you. While there's no argument that the 70s were the first golden age of the sitcom, MTM's competition hasn't aged nearly as well. Mary's show, once you get past the plank-wide ties and the quilted skirts, is a remarkably subtle piece of work, built on the beautiful interplay of Mary - the pollyanna - and the collection of needy, bitter, passive-aggressive, but alarmingly lovable characters around her. Betty White's Sue Ann Nivens, alas, doesn't show up for another couple of seasons, but Cloris Leachman's Phyllis and Ted Knight's Ted Baxter are astounding creations, one a harbinger of the budding me-decade, the other simply one of the best comic characters ever put on TV. Ed Asner's Lou Grant is still manic and threatening, his edges yet to be buffed down, and Mary quickly begins to explore her character's virtuousness, the small-town prom queen that we loved to ogle and humiliate at the same time.
There is an extra disc containing behind the scenes footage, original commercials and vintage Emmy award footage.  Worth every penny!  Highly recommended!",1046131200,11,1612,4.8014440433212995

Mary Richards is trying to start over in a new town.  Thanks to her friend Phyllis, she's found an apartment in Minneapolis.  Soon, she's got a job as associate producer for the evening news at WJM.  And between the two, she's got a wonderful support system that will help her through anything.  And we get to enjoy the laughs.
I'd forgotten just how much I loved this show until I got the set.  It was like reuniting with old friends.  Season 1 is definitely a beginning, however, as the writers begin to explore the characters.  Still, there are some classic episodes here, including ""Love is All Around,"" ""Support Your Local Mother,"" ""TouLouse-Lautrec is One of My Favorite Artists,"" ""Assistant Wanted, Female,"" ""Second-Story Story,"" and ""We Closed in Minneapolis"" to name a few.
The best part of this show is that the humor stems from the characters.  A lesser cast wouldn't be able to pull off some of the material, but this cast brings laughs a plenty.
The set has some interesting extras.  The best is the 87 minute documentary about the creation of the series.  The audio commentaries on three episodes are ok, but I didn't find them super interesting.  Of course, the main reason to get the set is the episodes themselves.  Here's they've been preserved with wonderful picture clarity and sound.  I doubt they've ever looked better.  Each episode has 10 chapter breaks in it, with the credits getting their own chapters.  This makes it easy to find a certain scene or get straight to the episode.  A play all feature would have been nice, but it's not completely necessary.

The episodes in this set shine with bright, vibrant colors, unlike the washed out tones we've seen in syndication and on cable.  Plus it's nice to know that you're seeing the complete episodes as opposed to ones that have been trimmed to fit in more commercials.
While this boxed set is more expensive than some of the others devoted to classic television shows, the slightly higher cost is more than justified by an entire disc of supplemental material.  (MASH and ALL IN THE FAMILY, for example, do not include anything beyond the season's episodes.)  The 90 minute documentary features new interviews with the cast as well as many members of the original creative team.  It is well put together as well as informative.  It is also the best of the recent ""Making of MTM"" specials that have run on CBS, TVLand, and A & E.
Other extras include CBS promos, Emmy Award clips, a trivia challenge, and commentaries on three of the 24 episodes.  The CBS promos are not for specific episodes, but instead are fun, funky, pre fall season spots drawing attention to the then unaired MTM and the CBS season ahead.  The Emmy Award clips include funny banter between Lucille Ball and Jack Benny as they present Ed Asner and Valerie Harper their awards.  The interactive trivia challenge has a different person involved with the MTM show - either in front of or behind the camera - asking each multiple choice question.  And in one of the commentaries, you can even hear the story of how the MTM kitten logo came to be.
This boxed set is truly a must have for television fans!",1039046400,3,1656,4.640410958904109

Many of the punchlines which have been edited out for the sake of a 30 minute time frame on tv have been added back in. I look forward to season two and hope that the rest of the series makes it's way to DVD as well.  Great documentary on the making of season 1 on disc 4 and the CBS promo clips are cool to see 30 years later.

Now you can do just that, because the entire first season of one of the best TV sitcoms of the '70s (with apologies to ""All in the Family"") has been released in a four DVD box set. We get to see the first embryonic episodes, where a wide eyed Mary Richards (in go-go boots, fur coat and a very short skirt) comes to cold Minneapolis to make a new life for herself. The TV viewer sees her move into the famous apartment with the big M and gets hired to work at WJM-TV, which produces the most (unintentionally) hilarious news broadcasts in town. And who can forget about Mary's gang of friends and co-workers who would eventually become her pseudo family? We get to see episode after episode, where Mr. Grant, Ted, Murray, Rhoda and of course Phyllis somehow gets the gal, ""who can turn the world on with her smile"", into some very hilarious and embarassing social situations! In all seriousness, this is the ground breaking TV show that launched the ideal that a single, independent women, could make it in the working world and not have to depend on a husband or boyfriend. It was done with wit, good writing and one of the best ensemble casts in the business. The DVD set is wonderful! The picture is crip & clear with color that practically pops.

I live in New York but in 1974 (August 16th to be exact) was fortunate enough to watch a taping of The Mary Tyler Moore Show.
What excitement and how genuinely funny (without being sophmoric) it was.
This box set contains the entire first season and watching it brings the same excitement I felt when I sat in the studio audience.
The scripts are masterpieces; the cast is nothing short of perfection; and then there is Mary.  Whether she's talking with Rhoda, rolling her eyes over what Ted Baxter says, smiling at Murray or about to cry, ""Oh Mr. Grant"" you can't help but fall in love with her.  She is so funny, sweet and a total person.
The sound and quality on the DVD is excellent and anyone who is serious about owning a masterpiece should add this boxed set to their collection.",1036281600,,912,4.4226190476190474
1456949,5,B00005JLIC,"OK, I admit it.  I didn't watch the show in the early seventies.  I was born during the first season, and somehow as a toddler, Sesame Street seemed more accessible.  But this set has allowed me to revel in what others got to see the first time around... one of the best written sitcoms ever.
I must admit part of the joy for me is seeing how times have changed.  Openly drinking whiskey at work?  Hiring someone based on her ""nice caboose"", and telling her?  Those pantsuits?  But seventies nostalgia aside, this show holds its own despite changing times and mores.  What makes it work is great character development and a focus on relationship rather than cookie-cutter sitcom farce.  It's feel-good television at its best, uplifting without being sickly sweet.  And who can't like Mary?
This boxed set makes a wonderful gift, maybe for someone like me who was to young to enjoy the original broadcast.  I watched mine on my computer on a long trip, and it sure beat the in-flight movie.  Remember, you're gonna make it after all!",1035849600,6,1032,4.6722222222222225
1456950,5,B00005JLIC,I have always loved the Mary Tyler Moore Show.  I cried at the show's end.  Ever since the introduction of home video I have longed to own this show.  Now with advent of dvd I finally have my wish granted. The transfer to dvd is excellent.  The sound is great.  This is a dvd fans of Mary's will have to have.  I can't wait for the next 6 seasons.  The documentary on disc 4 is very informative and told me things I did not know.  A perfect addition to your dvd collection.,1035676800,2,473,4.065217391304348
1456951,3,B00005JLIC,"Of course the actual show is great! The picture is fantastic, etc., but I'm upset about one thing: I am unable to play every episode on each disc in sequential order continuously. I have to select a new episode to watch after each episode! This is very irritating and unprofessional.",1034899200,9,283,4.68
1456952,5,B00005JLIC,"It ""still makes it after all""  I bought it thinking it was nostalgia.  Well, it is not, it stands the test of time.
These characters still exist and that is what makes it funny. Mary as the Almost Independant woman, Rhoda as her best friend and student, Phylis as the too old to learn, but almost role model.  If you already saw it, you'll love it again.  If you never saw it, you'll understand and love where you came from.  Five stars!!!",1034294400,2,439,4.304878048780488
1456953,4,B00005JLIC,"The first season of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" (1970-71) find Mary Richards settling into her Minneapolis apartment and the WJM newsroom.  The balance between ""home"" and ""work"" is obviously reminiscent of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" which had made Mary Tyler Moore a household name as Laura Petrie.  The identification was so great that CBS nixed plans to make Mary Richards a divorce because they were worried American would think she had divorced Dick Van Dyke.  Instead it was decided Mary would break her engagement with her boyfriend and try to make it on her own.

Most of the scripts this first season are written by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns, Treva Silverman, David Davis and Lorenzo Music, and Steve Pritzker.  The best episodes tend to focus on the trials and tribulations of Mary and neighbor Rhoda (Valerie Harper) as single women in their thirties, for which Silverman was usually the writer: Mary worries about being an old maid because a man in his twenties calls her ""ma'am'; Rhonda and Mary pretend to be divorced singles to get a cut-rate trip to Europe; Rhonda's boyfriend likes Mary better; the IRS agent auditing Mary is attracted to her; a young cameraman makes up stories about being romantically involved with Mary; the charming newsman Mary becomes involved with is married; and Mary dates her former boyfriend's brother.  This alone should convince you that the first season of ""MTM"" was atypical and not what you remember from its heyday.  Of course, during the first season the show was still developing the supporting characters and their relationships to one another, which is why you will find very few classic episodes of a show that was selected in 1985 as ""The Top TV Sitcom of All Time as Determined by the Nation's TV Critics.""

The episodes from the first season of ""MTM"" are: (1) ""Love Is All Around""; (2) ""Today I Am a Ma'am""; (3) ""Bess, You Is My Daughter Now""; (4) ""Divorce Isn't Everything""; (5) ""Keep Your Guard Up""; (6) ""Support Your Local Mother""; (7) Toulouse-Laurtrec Is One of My Favorite Artists""; (8) ""The Snow Must Go On""; (9) Bob and Rhoda and Ted and Mary""; (10) ""Assistant, Wanted, Female""; (11) ""1040 or Fight""; (12) ""Anchorman Overboard""; (13) ""He's All Yours""; (14) ""Christmas and the Hard-Luck Kid""; (15) ""Howard's Girl""; (16) ""Party Is Such Sweet Sorrow""; (17) ""Just a Lunch""; (18) ""Second-Story Story""; (19) ""We Closed in Minneapolis""; (20) ""Hi!""; (21) ""The Boss Isn't Coming to Dinner""; (22) ""A Friend in Deed""; (23) ""Smokey the Bear Wants You"": (24) ""The Forty-Five-Year-Old-Man"".  Brooks and Burns who won the Emmy for their script ""Support Your Local Mother,"" in which Rhonda's mother (Nancy Walker) shows up and spends all her time with Mary when her daughter refuses to see her.
""MTM"" finished in 22nd place in the Nielsens with a 20.3 rating (which would be good enough for 1st place today).  The first season is pretty good, by the standards of what was on at time in terms of situation comedies, which where mostly domestic comedies (""Here's Lucy,"" ""My Three Sons,"" ""The Doris Day Show,"" ""The Partridge Family,"" etc.).  But in the wake of ""MTM"" would come ""All in the Family"" and ""M*A*S*H.""  So, this first season is good, but what is coming gets pretty great.",1034294400,6,3234,4.849364791288567
1456954,4,B00005JLIC,"Finally, after years of waiting, the MTM Show, in broadcast order, with virtually no edits! The extras, like the commentaries, the promo clips, Emmy awards, stills gallery, and the documentary are fabulous! Like others, I wish there were more episodes with commentaries, though. Watching these classics becomes a whole new experience, when the actors, producers, directors and writers give their take on the proceedings.

After viewing the whole set, the only flaw I found is a missing moment from ""Christmas and the Hard Luck Kid II"".  The moment when Mary says she is going to cry, after singing ""White Christmas"", has been cut, oddly enough.

Otherwise, the set is a gem.  I am waiting patiently for Season Two, due in March.  Thanks Fox Video, Matt and Ed Asner and Danny Gold!",1034035200,2,781,4.931297709923665
1456955,5,B00005JLIC,"I absolutely *adore* THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW first season box set.  WOW!  The presentation and packaging is simply perfect.  The episodes themselves look better than they have since they first aired on CBS.  I makes me wish the rest of the seasons would be released quicker than every six months! (The second season is due in March 2003).
Assuming they go this route in terms of design and extras with every season in the future, this undoubtedly will be the most supreme television series collection on DVD EVER!  This release is aready one against which all other classic series' packages will and should be judged.  The fact that other classic series haven't received the same kind of treatment is a testament to just how beloved ""MTM"" is not only by fans, but the people who were involved with the show all those years.  My only quibble is they used way too much music in the documentary and it was a little distracting.  But that is so minor compared to all the joy that is elsewhere in this set.
By the way, listen to the French audio track for an instrumental version of ""Love Is All Around!""  This set makes me further proud to call THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW my favorite show of all time.",1033689600,13,1198,4.5092592592592595
1456956,5,B00005JLIC,"The Mary Tyler Moore Show was a groundbreaking television program as upon its debut in 1970, there were no shows on television that portrayed a strong minded single woman in her thirties.  But being original in theme can only take you so far.  What makes this show a classic is the great writing and the great acting from the entire cast.  Everyone involved from Ms. Moore to Ed Asner, Valerie Harper, Gavin MacLeod, Ted Knight and Cloris Leachman give standout performances.  The show is deserving of all it accolades and over thirty years later is still fresh, entertaining and hilarious.",1033689600,4,590,4.87

7939327,5,B00005JLIC,"When released, the show was one of a few at the time which carried a message of significant social change. Unlike some of the others, it's aged well.

The reason is generally good (and sometimes outstanding) writing, but moreso, one of the best ensemble casts a situation comedy ever had.

Although there were awkward moments in the first few episodes, as the main characters were introduced, once they'd been established, the actors quickly made them their own and added dimensions of depth that made them human.

Ed Asner played Lou Grant straight, which allowed him to take the character and make him much more relatable and sympathetic than he must have appeared on the page. His character is crucial and drives the action in more than a few episodes. Perhaps more than any other single element, Asner's brilliance made the show exceptional.

Valerie Harper, who was actually prettier than Mary, was an inspired choice as the ""dowdy"" Rhoda. Had she actually been unattractive, the self-deprecating humor would have had a sobering element of pathos. As it stood, she was superb.

Everyone was. Also worth noting is the introduction and evolution of Ted Knight's character. Though he had classic good looks, I think Knight started as a puppeteer and children's entertainer. His comic sensibility was different from the other actors and worked well in contrast. Ted Baxter was not a well drawn character. Knight's realization made the character human and endearing.

Somehow the first couple years of the series felt much lighter and breezier than the later years. Funnier too overall. This set was interesting and fun to watch. Five stars.",1523145600,,1641,5.059259259259259

When watching these shows originally, the era was such that it supported NOT being a pseudo-single, and/or ""career"" woman, so it was tolerable to watch for the ensemble cast.  As women have gone backwards in development, I don't want anyone modeling herself on the 'Mary' character.  Better to be 'Rhoda' or 'Phyllis' - best to be, 'Lou Grant'.",1514937600,,453,5.136986301369863
