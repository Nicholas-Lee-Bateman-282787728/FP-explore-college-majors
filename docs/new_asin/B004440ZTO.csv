8415808,5,B004440ZTO,I am very happy to have this item. It is a rare find. I plan to keep it for the long term.,1468627200,,90,3.1363636363636362
8415809,3,B004440ZTO,"For twenty dollars, this is actually a very short interview that lasts perhaps twenty-five minutes.  I felt terrible for Inman throughout the entire thing; the man who interviewed him had about as much personality as a grapefruit.  I could see in the poor chap's eyes, he was really frustrated and bored with what was going on, yet at the same time I'm sure he enjoyed the attention from the crowd.

Had the recording been maybe thirty to forty minutes longer, I would say it was worth more.  However, with Inman gone and so few interviews like this available to the public, perhaps it is worth twenty dollars, especially to the die-hard Inman fans.",1325030400,5,649,4.716814159292035
