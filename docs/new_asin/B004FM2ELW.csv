4370124,3,B004FM2ELW,"This movie is better than average, but somewhat unrealistic.  I found it to be entertaining, but you have to be patient to watch it.  Too many thing in it that just not the way  it is in life.",1378339200,,192,4.0
4370125,4,B004FM2ELW,Tangi Miller and Mr Yoba did their thing... Thought it was a great movie and especially loved the ending. Great movie,1377734400,,117,4.619047619047619
4370126,1,B004FM2ELW,"I thought this would be a fairly decent movie. I tried to stay with for as long as I could, but I had to eventually just stop watching it. Story line is pretty predictable.",1376179200,2,172,4.088235294117647
4370127,5,B004FM2ELW,I enjoyed watching this movie . I am sure many of us find ourselves in this situation sit back and enjoyl,1376006400,,105,4.0476190476190474
4370128,4,B004FM2ELW,"I really liked it! I love Tangi, love to see her in more projects! Mr Yoba is always excellent in everything he does!",1373760000,,117,4.130434782608695
4370129,3,B004FM2ELW,Took a minute to get into the movie and I just feel that the actors could have been better.  I have tried to watch it twice but felt the same both times.,1373760000,,153,3.78125
4370130,1,B004FM2ELW,"Honestly just watching the trailer decided for me if I should watch this!!! Horrible trailer! Not interested at all!
Amazon needs a better trailer not a clip from the movie because it really didn't give you an idea of the movie one bit!!!",1371686400,2,238,4.558139534883721
4370131,4,B004FM2ELW,I watch this movie hate the girl he was going marry but his old girl friend was on the same page way it should be he for her and her for him but that controlling women who wanting this and wanting that well she got nothing.,1363219200,,223,3.869565217391304
4370132,3,B004FM2ELW,Ok movie to watch but very predictable. Malik Yoba is a great actor so you'll enjoy him as usual.  It comes on TV from time to time so you could wait.  It usually airs on BET network I think.,1360886400,,191,3.871794871794872
4370133,4,B004FM2ELW,Like the actors and the moods and scenes that went on.  All the women got along great with their guys and made it easier for them to get back together.,1359590400,,151,4.033333333333333
4370154,4,B004FM2ELW,I enjoyed the movie it made laugh on how they ended getting back with each other in the movie they played the cat and mouse game until the end.,1357257600,,143,3.9655172413793105
4370155,5,B004FM2ELW,"I really enjoyed this love story.  The girlfriend returning is every man's nightmare and the movie did not disappoint.  Great chemistry among the actors, especially between Malik and his ""Dad"".  There is not obscenity, profanity, or buffoonery, just one good movie with a very realistic story line.",1351987200,,298,5.297872340425532
4370156,5,B004FM2ELW,"I really enjoyed this film. The two leads really had chemistry. The film had no cursing or profanity.

It was very romantic. I highly recommend this film to fans of African American romantic comedies.",1347235200,3,200,4.882352941176471
4370157,1,B004FM2ELW,This was so stupid!!! I'm so mad and I want my money back!!! The trailer lead me to believe that this was going to be a good movie. I am highly disappointed!!,1340841600,,158,3.96875
4370158,3,B004FM2ELW,My Girlfriend's Back was fair movie.  It is an eye opening about people that are not ready to committe to marriage but can mislead some by their actions.,1338940800,,153,4.464285714285714
4370159,5,B004FM2ELW,"This is a loving romantic movie with a lot of soul searching included. When the previous girlfriend returns, the male character (Malik Yoba) has to evaluate what is important in his life. Since he is engaged to another woman, is it job status or his own happiness that is most important?  I don't want to give away the plot, but this is a very good movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I don't understand the negative reviews, but what do I know, I am a hopeless romantic. Also, Malik Yoba was amazing.",1321315200,,500,4.4945054945054945
4370160,3,B004FM2ELW,"I just watched ""MY GIRLFRIEND'S BACK,"" and thought it was an entertaining romantic comedy with an appealing cast. The talented Tangi Miller (who co-produced and co-wrote the screenplay) is absolutely gorgeous. She does wonders with a character that should have been fleshed out more. Malik Yoba makes his conflicted feelings believable. Victoria Platt adds dimension to her character of the controlling high-society girlfriend, and even manages to engender some audience sympathy for this ostensibly unlikeable character. Obba Babatunde and CCH Pounder are great fun to watch as the girlfriend's haughty and image-conscious parents. There are some positive messages about making commitments and being true to your heart, and it was nice to see the positive, loving relationship between Yoba's character and his father. There's no cursing and no nudity. Situations are presented realistically and are fairly believable (though it was hard to believe that ANY man would let a woman like Tangi Miller get away), and, for the most part, the filmmakers don't go for cheap laughs. I think this is a good, well-acted movie with some positive messages that deserves to be seen by a wider audience. I'm glad I purchased it.",1311638400,12,1214,5.295336787564767
4370161,4,B004FM2ELW,"Overall this was a good movie. It basically had a classic subject.. When the ex-girlfriend returns, the ex-boyfriend's engagement with his fiancee is off.",1308873600,,154,5.458333333333333
4370162,4,B004FM2ELW,A successful young man with an ambitious overbearing girlfriend falls prey to his own feelings.  The feelings are for his past love or love he lost (so to speak).  She and he seem to have a most natural love unlike the fake and forced relationship he has with his current girlfriend.  It all works out in the end.  I liked it.,1308528000,,326,4.295081967213115
4370163,1,B004FM2ELW,"This was THE WORST ""movie"" that we have ever seen. I am so glad that we only spent $1 renting this movie. If you have not purchased this movie, don't think about doing so. If you have not seen this move, you haven't missed a thing. This movie was a collection of unrelated characters with a storyline so loose and disjointed that you spent the entire movie attempting to figure out what was happening. No character development, no storyline backdrop or development, nothing about this film was worth watching. How did it make it to production? Malik Yoba has appeared in pretty good works, so we were shocked to see him associated with this garbage. Unbelievable that this mess was produced for public consumption.",1306713600,5,714,4.766129032258065
