Not boring and gets good workout

I am in my late 50's with low back problems and find laying down hard for me .  This really has helped me get a work out and relax with meditative hints as well",1257206400,4,218,3.8222222222222224
1017136,5,6305384142,"It's possible to get the benefits of yoga without ever leaving your chair.

In Sitting Fit Anytime, Certified Anusara Yoga Teacher, Susan Winter Ward,  guides you through simple effective seated exercises that are perfect if you have limited mobility or want to do a little yoga at your desk. All the yoga stretches, which are done from the comfort of your chair, will help relieve stress and tension and improve circulation while building strength and flexibility.

The DVD includes nine 3 to 5 minute segments that focus on:

  *Breathing
  *Head, Neck & Shoulders
  *Hands & Wrists
  *Arms & Upper Back
  *Hips & Lower Back
  *Hamstrings & Forward Bends
  *Abdominals
  *Feet
  *Meditation

There is nothing particularly exciting or sexy about this DVD. The set is simple - just Susan seated in an over-sized ladder back chair demonstrating each pose while she provides detailed verbal instruction in a calm and soothing manner. The set backdrop suggests blue sky and clouds, while subtle flute/guitar music plays quietly in the background. This DVD is also available in a CD-Rom with screen saver format designed to prompt you to take intermittent yoga at your desk breaks.

This Chair yoga DVD is a great way to get introduced to the benefits of yoga from the comfort of your chair or desk. Don't be put off by the introduction where Susan is shown doing more advanced yoga poses with the chair as a prop. Nothing closely resembling these moves is included in the instructional portion of the DVD.

Highly recommended, especially for those with limited mobility who want to experience the benefits of yoga.",1231977600,27,1611,4.943820224719101

1017138,5,6305384142,"I was a dancer and dance instructor for thirty years.  I was a certified Iyengar Yoga instructor.  I was an aerobics champion.  Past tense.  I'm now fifty-seven and have had two heart attacks, have SVTach, and am now nearly housebound with Meniere's Disease (including violent vertigo), and several herniated discs in my back.  In short, I'm a wreck.

I own about two dozen tapes/DVDs for the old, infirm, and otherwise jacked-up.  This DVD is the only one I use.  It gives me a nice workout, but allows me the much-needed security of either sitting in or hanging onto a chair.  Movements are explained well and demonstrated clearly.  The Yoga instructor knows what she's doing and how to make exercising tolerable for those of us who can't participate in ""real"" Yoga.

All all-around great DVD.",1170201600,82,795,4.858208955223881
1017139,1,6305384142,"If you are a yoga master, this is the tape for you.  Why, you'll sit in the full lotus position not on a comfy mat but on a chair.  Yes, that should be easier!  Well, I've got to say that my friend and I, who work out together and have the same physical limitations, had a wonderous rolling-in-the-floor laugh over  this one, so for that it has value.  This is really geared for the average to above average in fitness who have a very good sense of balance.  Too tough for us, but we'll save it just for the inspiration.  She was able to do some amazing things.",1164067200,60,561,4.138888888888889
1017280,2,6305384142,"Based on the description of this DVD, I expected it to be geared towards people like myself who are older, less flexible, or dealing with injuries. I didn't find that to be the case.

To be fair, the first 3 segments on breathing, head, neck and shoulders, and hands and wrists were helpful and easy for me to follow. But as the DVD progressed to arms, upper back, abdominal exercises, etc. I found it impossible to follow. Unlike the instructor, I am not flexible enough to pull my foot up to my chest, sit in lotus position on the chair, etc. If you can do those positions on the chair, you can most likely do them more comfortably on the floor.

Since I am heavy, I didn't have room on my chair to place the sole of my foot against my upper inner thigh, though I can easily do this on the floor.

The abdominal exercises, which consist mostly of leg lifts, caused pain in my lower back, so I quickly stopped doing them. I can actually do some of these leg lifts on the floor without discomfort, so for me doing them in a chair was pointless and could have been harmful. Also, the instructor should address the issue of protecting your lower back during these moves.

If you are slim and very limber and want to do yoga in a chair, this DVD may be useful to you, but I don't recommend it for older folks who have physical limitations.",1370822400,5,1336,4.2896825396825395
1017281,2,6305384142,"I am currently recovering from a devastating auto accident.  I have very little use of my right leg, and am unable to continue my usual (standing) yoga practice.  After looking for a seated yoga practice, this one seemed to promise that it was geared towards those recovering from injury, so I decided to try it first.

This practice requires fairly extensive use of the legs.  While I would expect any adaptive yoga practice to include poses any user might not be able to do, due to specific limitations, this practice incorporates the legs into almost every segment - something I found insensitive and counterproductive in a product designed for those who are confined to sitting.  If my legs worked I'd be buying a regular yoga dvd!  The ""arms"" segment calls for arm push-ups un the chair (shifting most weight onto the feet).  The ""abs"" section is composed entirely of leg lifts.

Several of the poses require very advanced flexibility.  While that is the goal of any yoga practice, given that this is a practice for people with physical limitations it would have been much better (and more reassuring) if the instructor demonstrated modifications for those who can't reach the full stretch yet.  There is only one stretch early on where a yoga strap was used, but I found several poses where the strap helped me benefit from a stretch where I couldn't quite achieve the flexibility of the instructor - so why not show that?

The structure and sequence of the video aren't bad, and if you are an experienced practitioner who feels comfortable designing your own modifications then you may be satisfied.  However, I was looking for someone who could give me ideas about how to best get the benefits of yoga with my new physical limitations, and this didn't do it.  I feel like I could put in one of my old yoga workout dvds and just make up ways to do them seated, and do just as well.

I'll keep searching...",1370736000,3,1912,4.68562874251497

Many young people can't do what she demonstrates, and many seniors are definitely not going to get into these positions.  Prayer behind the back?  Come on!  Obviously some seniors are athletes --but they aren't looking for a chair class. She also features deep twists (contraindicated for seniors who may have osteoperosis) and deep forward bends that could cause anyone to fall off their chair, let alone someone who might have a blood pressure or heart issue.  Further she does some moves in the beginning in her leotard that belong in Cabaret or Show Girls.
