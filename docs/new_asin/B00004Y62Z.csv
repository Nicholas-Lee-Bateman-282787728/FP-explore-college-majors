1372818,5,B00004Y62Z,"'Amok Time' enlightens us to the Vulcan biological cycle and their mating rituals. Vulcan males must return to their home planet every seven years to  experience ""pon farr"", and in this episode Kirk risks his career  to divert the Enterprise to Vulcan. Once home, Spock must carry out an  arranged marriage supervised by Vulcan leader T'Pau...
I won't spoil it  for you, but trivia fans will note that ""T'Pau"" was the name of a  pop group during the 1980s, and that this Trek episode was recently  parodied on the FOX show ""Futurama"".",966902400,2,534,4.75
1372829,5,B00004Y62Z,"In Amok Time, we get a first hand view of the power and influence of Spock's family.  In the book, ""Spocks World"" the author describes Spock's family possessing vast amounts of land.  By right, Jim and McCoy may accompany Spock, as his friends, too his home world and beam down onto the Spock's families land.  The customs of Vulcan are not open to outsiders. Jim says to McCoy, ""Now I know what 'Hot as Vulcan means', the air is thinner than earth's air.

Spock tells Jim that a short ritual will transpire and Ta Pring will become his wife.  The marriage arrangement was established when both Spock and Ta Pring were very young, a mind melt; less, than a marriage but more than a betrothal.  As the marriage party approaches, Ta Pow leads the brides family.  Jim leans over too McCoy and says, ""Do you know who that is?  That is Ta Pow.  All of Vulcan, in one.  The only person ever to turn down a seat on the federation. Spock never told me his family was this influencial.""

Ta Pring initiates her ancient rite to Kali Fe, the challenge.  Spock must fight for her hand in marriage.  Long before logical and peace doctrines surpressed violent warlike drives, combat and warfare were the methods of conquest and possession.  Ta Pring was within her rites.  A Vulcan could not divorce himself from his custom, beliefs, and heritage; nor, could a Vulcan ignore the ancient drives to select a mate or die trying.  Ta Pring choses Jim, as her champion.  Spock begs Ta Pow, too forbid the challenge with Jim, declaring, ""He does not understand, I will do what I must.  Forbid!""  Ta Pow respect for Spock seems lacking, ""It is said, 'thy blood is thin!  Are thee Vulcan or Human?""  Spock's family honour does not go tainted, ""My eyes burns, my heart burns.  In the name of my fathers, forbid!""  Ta Pow has other plans.

Jim looks over at Stonn but is staunchly told by Ta Pow, ""Do not interfere"".  Jim tells McCoy, he does think Spock will be able beat Stonn, in his current condition; he will fight Spock and if he starts to winn, he will allow Spock too win; the challenge is accepted, Ta Pow ask Ta Pring, if she is willing to become the property of the victor; and narrates, ""as it was in the beginning, so it is now.  Challenge was been legally accept.  The fight will commence with the Lippa and then too the iron womb until one is dead.""  Jim holds his own against Spock.  McCoy tells Ta Pow, ""Do you call this Vulcan Chivalry?  The air is too thin.""  Ta Pow, says ""the air is the air. What can be done?""  McCoy holds up a vial of medication and says, ""I can give him this.""  McCoy slips Jim a neural paralyzer which simulates death.  Spock wins the battle and demands the Ta Pring explain.  Ta Pring says, ""specify"".  Spock rebuttals, ""explain why the challenge."" ""Stonn wanted me and I wanted Stonn"".  Spock seems disgussed, ""I see no advantage in chosing Stonn over me.""  Spock had become famous among the people of Vulcan for his achievements in science.  ""I realized I did not want to become a consort of a legand.  If I had dared to challenge you, you would have put me off, and I would still have Stonn.  If you had not put me off, you would be gone and I would have Stonn.  If you did not put me off, I would have my property and household; and Stonn would still be here""  Spock seems satified, ""Logical, flawlessly logical.""  Spock tells Stonn wisdom, ""Wanting is a more pleasing thing than having.  It is not logical but often true.""  When Spock gets back on the enterprise, his human emotions break through,as he yells, ""Captain Kirk. Jim!"", as he grabs Jim and smiles.  McCoy pokes fun at Spock and says, ""You can't tell me that when you saw Captain Kirk that you let a emotion outburst that would have brought down the roof.""  ""No doctor, it was my mere expression of relief of Star Fleets not loosing a good captain.""  McCoy slyly says, ""In a pigs eye.""",1132099200,,3870,4.4289772727272725

Expendable Enterprise Crewmember (`Red Shirt') Confirmed Casualty List: None

REVIEW/COMMENTARY:

Following in the footsteps of `The Squire of Gothos' and `Charlie X', our gallant captain and a few cohorts have to escape from the seemingly all-powerful clutches of the deity Apollo from Greek mythology. Scotty is showcased here by getting his you-know-what handed to him on a couple occasions by Apollo over the hand of babe-of-the-week Carolyn Palamas ( Leslie Parrish). Romantic triangles don't get much more dangerous than this! Also notable is the Monkees rug that Chekov's got on, which wasn't quite as overdone as the previous ones he had to wear. Throw in the tried-and-true drain-the-energy-from-the-all-powerful-being ploy, mix it with a dash of the last-minute-rescue-format, rub it all down with the somewhat tragic epilogue featuring Jimmers doing his hushed and somewhat despondent monologue about the tragic loss of a potential link to mankind's past, and broil to a golden brown. M'm, m'm, good!

Moral, Ethical, and/or Philosophical Subject(s) Driven Into The Ground: The trials of friendship / the nightmare of losing one's self-control

REVIEW/COMMENTARY: Uh-oh... Spock's got a certain urge, and his shipmates will need to change course and get him back to Vulcan, or else (*GASP!*) he'll croak! Now this wouldn't be such a difficulty except for the fact that the Enterprise is ordered to attend a ceremony at a planet that's several light-years away! Will Jimmers break the rules again to save the life of his first officer and valued friend?! Oh, the suspense! Oh, the humanity! Oh my God, is that Jim fightin' Spock to the death to help save his life after they touch down on Vulcan? Yep, it sure is! And thanks to this little blood match, we are treated to yet another Kirk's-uniform-top-gets-ripped-in-combat episode as he barely ducks a close call from Spock's giant bladed Q-Tip-lookin' weapon! Fortunately, McCoy helps Kirk fake his death in battle, Spock displays some genuine emotions in front of his captain and good doctor, and all is well once again! Well, all will be well for the next seven years, anyway...

1372832,5,B00004Y62Z,"Volume 17 of the Star Trek DVD Collection features two episodes that take a look at human history as well as Vulcan.  Containing two classic from the second season of this series this DVD is a definite must if you are only cherry picking Star Trek TOS DVD's rather than buying every one of them.
The first episode here is AMOK TIME which is easily one of Trek's most classic episodes.  It's the first time Kirk and the crew visit the planet Vulcan as well as the viewers first look at Vulcan women.  The story finds Spock suffering from ""Pon Farr"" the vulcan mating call.  Spock must go to Vulcan and marry T'Pring (played by Arlene Martel) or he will die.  Upon arrival on Vulcan.  T'Pring demands Spock to fight for her in order to marry her and she chooses Kirk as Spock's opponent!  The climax finds Kirk fighting for his dear life against a blood thristy tranced Spock with deadly Vulcan weapons.  AMOK TIME is truly one of Star Trek's best episodes.  A classic!
The other episode here WHO MOURNS FOR ADONAIS? is slightly weaker than AMOK TIME but still is a great episode.
This was actually a good idea to fuse sci-fi and Greek mythology together in one fascinating epic.  The Crew are nearing the planet Pollux IV when a giant hand holds the ship.  Kirk, Scotty, Chekov, McCoy and Lt. Carolyn Palamas are transported down to the planet and meet a being who claims he his Apollo the last of the Greek Gods to live on Munt Olympus.  He demands Kirk to beam his entire crew down to the planet.  Kirk and the others refuse and Apollo begins to threaten them with lightning bolts.  Eventually Carolyn falls in love with Apollo and hampers all attempts to stop the god's control over holding the ship and crew.  Kirk soon realizes that if he does not meet Apollo's demands the short tempered god will destroy the Enterprise and it's crew.
WHO MOURNS FOR ADONAIS? is an above average episode despite being overshadowed by AMOK TIME.
As for this DVD? It is a definite must.  These two classics cannot be found anywhere else in this high quality.  If you love the original series this is wonderful thing to add to your DVD collection.  Highly recommended!",1030320000,,2153,4.548051948051948
1372833,5,B00004Y62Z,"Two of Trek's best, with strong scripts, solid production and great guest stars.
""Who Mourns for Adonais?"" finds the Enterprise meeting up with the last of mans' progenitors, the god Apollo, himself (Michael Forest).  He halts the Enterprise with a giant energy-field hand, and insists its crew abandon their space voyage to spend the rest of eternity with him, picking posies and singing his praises.  Kirk, of course, will have none of that (it's an alpha-male dominance thing), and Scotty gets his feathers riled when Apollo takes an amorous liking to comely Lieutenant Carolyn Palomas (Leslie Parrish), his own latest favorite.  Unfortunately, the lovely lieutenant seems to like older men  -  several millennia older, you could say  -  and prefers Apollo's offer.  Captain Kirk has to play on her loyalties to Starfleet  -  and the human race  -  to get her to distract Apollo long enough to overthrow him.
Forest is perfect as Apollo, with a splendid physique and a regal but likeable manner.  In fact, it's hard to fully understand Kirk's and the Enterprise crew's reluctance to retire and settle down with him.  Especially so the lucky (unlucky?) lieutenant, whose emotional turmoil is heart-wrenchingly played by the consistently excellent Leslie Parrish.
""Amok Time"" is one of Trek's top ten episodes, no matter how you slice it, and deals with the mating urge of another race of aliens:  the Vulcans.  Do those stoic computers-on-legs ever really get it on?  You bet they do, and the half-human self-control freak Spock has a more than usually difficult time subduing his passions when the seven-year biological mating cycle hits him.  Kirk defies Starfleet orders to spirit Spock away to Vulcan in the middle of a mission, since a delay could literally cost Spock his life.  Kirk and McCoy become the first humans ever to enter a Vulcan Temple  -  an impressively designed Egypto-Roman/Hebraic affair  -  and meet the regal Vulcan ruler, T'pau, and Spock's beautiful betrothed, T'pring, who turns out to be rather ruthless in her exercise of logic:  she finagles a contest to the death between Spock and his best friend, Kirk, to further a hidden agenda of her own.  In order to save Spock's life, will Kirk have to lose his own  -  at Spock's hands?
A truly great episode, dramatic and suspenseful, with beautiful production design.  Celia Lovsky magnificently embodies the stern and stoic T'pau, and the exotically beautiful Arline Martel portrays T'pring with a quiet air of ruthless menace and allure.  There's a great blooper in this episode, if you watch close:  Spock, at one point, snaps suddenly to attention from a reclining position against a wall on Vulcan  -  actor Leonard Nimoy was smoking a cigarette waiting for his scene to resume, and it came quicker than he expected.  It's pretty funny  -  but the entire cast is so good, and the action so gripping, that you'd never see it if you didn't know specifically to look for it.",1027987200,,2954,4.94704684317719
1372834,5,B00004Y62Z,"Volume 17 of Paramount's complete reissue of Classic Trek contains two popular episodes from the series' second season.
Who Mourns for Adonais? makes use of the false-god plotline seen elsewhere in the series.  In this case, the deity is not a computer but rather an alien with psychokinetic powers.  Michael Forest makes a memorable appearance as Apollo--he both looks and acts the part.
On every level, Amok Time is one of Star Trek's very finest episodes.  Tackling head-on the subjects of sex, friendship, and loyalty, Theodore Sturgeon's story is filled with compelling situations and memorable dialogue.  The scene where Spock confesses the nature of his problems to Captain Kirk, brilliantly conveyed by Nimoy and Shatner, is one of the most awkward ""father/son"" chats ever filmed.  Gerald Fried's score (taking its neo-primitivistic inspiration from Stavinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps) coveys both the painfulness of Spock's situation, and the ceremonial brutality of the Vulcan sequences with stunning impact.  How was it, with their limited budget, the producers could afford such lavish scoring?
Fortunately, the sound restoration emphasizes the remarkable scoring, while tastefully enhancing the sound effects and clarifying the dialogue.  The picture has never looked better.",1000598400,6,1287,5.603092783505154
1372835,5,B00004Y62Z,"This is the best episode. Not only does it show insite into Spock and Vulcan but it also is acted and writtin in a way that sets it apart from the others in the original series. There are always a few episodes in each of the Star Treks that jumps much farther ahead and sets a new standard for space drama and this is the perfect example. When Kirk says ""I have heard nothing you said, but I will get you to Vulcan."" So mysteriously formal. Wonderful.  If you cry when Sarek says ""So human"" in Star Trek V, this is the episode you have been waiting for.",999648000,7,553,4.12037037037037
1372836,5,B00004Y62Z,"To my mind, these are two of the best of the Original Series.
_Adonais_ faces off Kirk and the Greek God Apollo, part of a race of powerful extraterrestrials who once visited Earth.  Throw in some (rare) romance for Scottie, some good lines for Chekov, Spock showing off his command style, and Kirk at his commanding best, and you've got an episode I'd consider for any Top Ten list.
_Amok Time_ is almost too famous, being the basis for so much of what we know (and fan-fic) about Spock.  Still, even with the overexposure, it features some solid acting by both Nimoy and Shatner, and some of the best Nurse Chapel scenes on film.
While this DVD series suffers from some awful combinations, I'd say this volume is one to definitely include.",995587200,8,741,4.606060606060606
1372837,4,B00004Y62Z,"When Paramount announced the release of the Classic Star Treks on DVD, I was excited. Why? Amok Time. It is(in my opinion) the best episode. It takes out some of the mystery behind the Vulcan Race. Spock is suddenly ill. Dr. McCoy has no diagnosis for the illness. All Spock will tell Capt. Kirk is that he must return to his home planet or he will die! The Enterprise diverts to Vulcan where a surprise is waiting for the landing party AND the people of Vulcan. You must see for yourself what the surprise is. I don't want to ruin it.  I gave this 4 stars because I did not find ""Who Mourns for Adonis"" that facinating! For those that have seen these two episodes on VHS or when they originally aired, you will be very impressed with the picture quality and sound on this DVD edition.  I own all 18 volumes of the original series that are currently released. They all have been restored beyond my expectations! If you are a full or part time ""Trekkie"", these DVDs are a must for your collection!",980208000,5,996,4.378378378378378
1372838,5,B00004Y62Z,"Forget about City on the Edge of Forver!  It's GREAT, yes, but for my money the definitive Trek episode has to be ""Amok Time.""  It's an episode that so strongly defines the friendship, loyalty and respect that made the original triad of Kirk/Spock/McCoy work so well.  Spock is driven by the Vulan mating urge to return to Vulcan and take a wife or die trying. Kirk decides to whatever it takes to help his friend--including throwing away his career if he must.  And McCoy provides the human persepctive and gets his own share of great moments in the episode. It all ends up on Vulcan where a plotting intended pits Kirk against Spock to get exactly what she wants and the duo is forced to fight to the death.  The episode is taut and action packed and full of startling character moments. It contains probably the best and most subtle of all the friendship scenes between the triad--in the turbolift as Spock requests McCoy attend the cermonies with them.  That one scene sums up the trio and why the original Star Trek worked so well.  This is one that I've seen more times than I can care to count and I always look forward to watching again.  And the DVD release is extremely welcome.
As for the other episode on this DVD, it's not one of my all time favorites. It's possible that when seen beside Amok Time, it pales a bit. There are certainly some intersting and memorable scenes here--including Apollo's hand reaching out to grab the Enterprise. Also, seeing Kirk go up against a Greek god is nicely done.  There are stories about Lt. Pallama's dress and practical jokes on the set with it (apparently it was weighted in the back and the cast used to regularily flip it up and expose her as it were).  Apollo is an interesting adversary for Kirk, but certainly he's not up to the standards of Khan or the Captain Kang.  And it's certainly not the only time in the second season that the Enterprise will use the phasers to stop an apparent god (though it's certainly done better here than the Apple).
But simply for the fact that you get Amok Time in pristene, DVD quality, this one is well worth the money. This is Star Trek (of any series) at it's best.",972259200,6,2161,4.487244897959184

The pacing of the scenes is also first class and all in all makes this a very memorable episode.

The first episode holds a lot of melodrama and is based upon an interesting premise: what if the ancient Greek gods we actually aliens?  The overall episode is average though but still worth getting on dvd.
