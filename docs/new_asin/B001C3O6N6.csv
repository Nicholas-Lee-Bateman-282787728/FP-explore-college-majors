If this is what you are looking for, do NOT buy this. It was an OLD 1960's animated movie that had horrible picture&sound that was not digitally restored. There was no plot and no dialogue. It was just a low grade cartoon with music in the background. The Dear Santa movie was appropriate for a child that still believes in Santa, so I would not allow him to even watch that one! A total waste of money!!!",1387411200,,538,4.39
