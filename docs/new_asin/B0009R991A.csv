8065507,1,B0009R991A,"""Audio Enhanced"" means some wannabe foley artists added sound effects over the audio ... it's improperly balanced, distracting, and sometimes you can't hear the dialog over the ridiculous effects..  these ARE NOT the best video either... truncated in some parts -- soft focus and poor lighting - dark prints... the Superman cartoons were gorgeous.. these don't do them justice ...

Horrible... There are better DVD's of the Superman classics than these pathetic, anemic, poorly crafted trash.",1498003200,,492,5.4605263157894735

8065509,5,B0009R991A,I love the old cartoon shorts from the 1940s.  The only drawback from the DVD is that there isn't more content on the disk but still well worth the price.,1299110400,,154,4.133333333333334
8065510,4,B0009R991A,"The Superman series, FLEISCHER's final independent animations, are artistically some of their very finest. This level of quality was maintained after FAMOUS's late-1942 takeover of Max Fleischer's studio was completed. Seventeen shorts were issued between 1941 and '43.

They've been in the public domain for many years. Most budget labels (including California's VINA) dub from unrestored film stock, which means colors aren't fresh, but the shorts are still satisfactory, especially at this low price.
