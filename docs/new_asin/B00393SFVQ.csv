8391898,4,B00393SFVQ,"Queen's Blade is a series that is built upon its superb characters, and the second volume of the anime expands the cast past the introductory characters from the first volume. As the first season enters it's halfway point the foundation begins to establish itself by introducing more characters and expanding the characters of the existing ones. The action, character development, diverse vistas, and great music are all back in stronger form than in the first volume; sure to satisfy anyone who was not satisfied by the action in the first volume.

The fanservice is still in strong form in this volume, perhaps even stronger than the first, but, as always, the series executes it's fanservice with sophistication and toungue-in-cheek moments of humor. This is one of the main highlights of the series; how the fanservice in Queen's Blade never feels forced, unnecessary, or juvenile in it's execution. As a result, Queen's Blade comes across as a fanservice anime that one can respect for it's characters, story, humor, and action rather than one of those anime one hides under their bed.

With this volume, Queen's Blade is at the midway point of it's first season; however, the entire first season acts as a foundation for the simply stellar second season. This is why I give it 4 stars. The second season is definite 5 star material.",1279065600,14,1338,4.942222222222222
