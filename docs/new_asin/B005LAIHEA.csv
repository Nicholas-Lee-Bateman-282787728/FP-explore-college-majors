4738079,5,B005LAIHEA,"""The Five-Year Engagement"" is great! This is how the story goes: Beginning where most romantic comedies end, this film looks at what happens when an engaged couple keeps getting tripped up on the long walk down the aisle.

The cast led by Jason Segel (as Tom, who also co-wrote the story & screenplay & executive produced) & Emily Blunt (as Violet) is great. The directing by Nicholas Stoller (who also co-wrote the story & screenplay & produced) is great. The story & screenplay by Segel & Stoller is great.

The music by Michael Andrews is great. The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is great. The film editing by William Kerr & Peck Prior is great. The production design by Julie Berghoff is great. The art direction by John B. Josselyn is great. The set decoration by Sophie Neudorfer is great. The costume design by Leesa Evans is great.

This is a great and funny romantic comedy-drama that feels different from some romantic comedy-dramas of recent memory. This is also another interesting Judd Apatow production that does a terrific job of mixing romance, comedy and drama blend solidly well. Jason Segel & Emily Blunt have terrific chemistry together. This is also a well-made and well-done movie, as well.",1335657600,2,1221,4.91747572815534
4738080,4,B005LAIHEA,"Judd Apatow seems to be everywhere these days. If he's not directing, he is writing and/or producing, and quite successfully at that. Jason Segel and Judd Apatown have teamed up before on ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", which worked out quite well for them, so why not do it again. In the marketing of this movie, a major emphasis was put on the fact that this is ""from the producers of Bridesmades"". The latter is of course now the gold standard for smart and funny romantic comedies from Hollywood. Would this movie live up to that standard?

""The Five-Year Engagement"" (122 min.) brings the story of Tom (played by Jason Segel) and Violet (played by Emily Blunt), who are in love and decide to get engaged. However, because of circumstances (primarily Violet being offered a significant job opportunity in academics at U of Muchigan), the couple moves away from San Francisco, where Tom was a successful sous-chef, on the verge of making it big as a chef. It comes as no surprise that Tom is deeply unhappy in Michigan, as he cannot find a satisfying position as a sophisticated chef in Ann Arbor. This is the key part of the movie, and in this sense, the movie's title is really misleading. It's not about being engaged or falling in or out of live, but it's about what happens when a guy gives up his career ambitions to allow his girl/gf/fiancee/wife to fulfill HER career ambitions. Much hilarious scenes ensue. At a certain point, Tom admits to Violet that he is deeply unhappy, there is much shouting back and forth, and Tom says ""I think I want to be alone now"", at which point Violet leaves their bed, ready to go sleep on the couch. Tom: ""Where are you going?"" Violet: ""But I thought you wanted to have time to yourself?"" Tom: ""Yea, I want to be by myself with you here, come back!"". It's a golden moment in the movie.

I don't think I will shock anyone when I say that the movie has a ""happy ending"", I mean this IS still Hollywood main fare after all. (Same complaint I have with that other recent excellent romcom ""Friends With Kids"".) In the end I guess that's ok. I enjoyed the movie quite a lot, up until the very end when it became very predictable how it all was going to end. But I sensed that the theatre audience really liked the movie. Special mention for Emily Blunt's delightful performance as Violet, simply oozing charm all over. Bottom line: no, this is not as good as ""Bridemades"" but then again I think few romcoms will live up to that standard. I quite enjoyed ""The Five-Year Engagement"" for what it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1335571200,2,2552,4.557734204793029
4738081,4,B005LAIHEA,"This was one of those instances where low expectations really paid off. Had I realized that the film was directed by Nicholas Stoller (the man behind Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek), then I may have had a bit more confidence in it.

Trailers made it seem like The Five-Year Engagement wasn't going to be so great though. It just looked like every other formulaic R-rated comedy out there. Several people who also attended the screening I went to felt the same way. ""This'll be decent at best,"" we all thought. Thankfully we were gob smacked with something a lot better than okay that was just shy of being really great.

The Five-Year Engagement is obviously centered on Tom and Violet, but the supporting cast is so freaking good. The Alex and Suzie characters are hilarious. Suzie has this party girl kind of quality to her, but she's so emotional and really spontaneous. Alex is the typical jock/playboy type of character, but his one-liners are really funny. At their wedding, Alex sings this song to Suzie in Spanish. That alone is fantastic, but his facial expressions just take it to an entirely different level of hilarity.

Violet's classmates in college; Ming (Randall Park), Doug (Kevin Hart), and Vaneetha (""The Office""'s Mindy Kaling) have more than their share of stand-out scenes. Tarquin (Brian Posehn) is funny in this really inappropriate way and Bill's (Chris Parnell) fascination with knitting sweaters is a gag that somehow never really gets old.

Tom and Violet have so many classic scenes, as well. The bedroom conversation where Tom just wants to be alone is the first that comes to mind. Then there's the fake orgasm scene and Tom's ridiculous apron. The scene people will probably be talking about most though is the scene when Violet and Suzie are having a conversation while imitating Cookie Monster and Elmo. That might be the most humorous sequence in the entire comedy.

The Five-Year Engagement isn't just a flat comedy though. It has layers to it. These characters feel like they have some depth to them. There's character development and drama, heartbreak and depression, and compassion and reconnection on top of the comedy. It's a comedy that makes a complete cycle to actually feel like you're witnessing an authentic relationship.

The film does feel a bit long though. The second act just drags on and on at times. Some of the psychology bits didn't seem completely necessary to the storyline either and the last hour could've been trimmed down a good twenty to thirty minutes.

The Five-Year Engagement runs longer than it should, but is otherwise a very charming R-rated romantic comedy. The way these characters are planned out and the decisions they make feel very human. Delightfully sincere and downright hilarious at times, The Five-Year Engagement is a pleasant surprise and a fantastic date night comedy that will appeal to both sexes.",1335484800,2,2903,4.960905349794238

4738275,5,B005LAIHEA,"An engaging film that didn't find its audience, or so it seems. Though there's no proof this film seems to be punished for neither being Bridesmaids at one end of the spectrum not Forgetting Sarah Marshall at the other.

This is a shame as on its own The Five Year Engagement is, as it's own entity, an enjoyable, somewhat unpredictable, yes, of course, some plot points are completely predictable, yet the movie holds its own and has pathos as well as humor, if sometimes raunchy.

Jason Segel, Emily Blunt, and the excellent supporting cast do a fine job and are convincing in their roles. The writing and script are effective and moods vary which perhaps is a reason for some viewer push back.

For me, I related to the ups and downs, the feelings of insecurity that are a strong theme of the film. It isn't, thankfully, standard romcom fare. Beyond some wildly comic moments there is heart within this film..

The BlueRay is filled with lots of extras that bring perspective to the filmmaking and ideas behind the film. It's a bit more subdued than some other Judd Apatow productions but in many ways more subtle and feeling genuine which makes it worth serious consideration.",1502236800,,1180,4.713592233009709

4738279,5,B005LAIHEA,"A lot more subtle than I expected. The movies frames a romantic comedy theme as a marshmellow test protocol. It is tightly scripted, the actors were obviously enjoying themself with it, and small scenes were lovingly crafted. Even a minor detail like how the food truck was done were highly inventive. All required themes: parents not so silently pushing them to get married, religious differences between the engaged, workplace romance, player vs nice guy,  a cameo by puppets (a typical Jason Segel item) were worked out in loving detail.",1492473600,,540,5.067415730337078

4738562,4,B005LAIHEA,"Following my engagement, I bought my husband to be a collection of wedding themed movies. In the years we were dating, we went to the movies on an almost weekly basis. Leading up the wedding, movies got pushed aside to save money and save time planning.

The Five Year Engagement is an all too real comedy about how life can get in the way of wedding planning. This was a great film to put on to get excited for our own wedding and be relieved that we had made it. It is a great mix of serious and funny. The Five Year Engagement has a great cast, with Emily Blunt and Jason Segel.

4738568,3,B005LAIHEA,"It has a cast of comedians, but the film is more of a tragedy than a comedy.

We have a couple that falls madly in love and then decides to put off getting married.

They leave their safe, happy haven in San Francisco for our heroine to pursue a psych degree.

Her boyfriend, fiancee is a chef, but has to settle for working as a sandwich maker at a dive in town.

Meanwhile, our heroine continues to insist on having her way, driving our hero further into depression.

Finally, she leaves him for her college professor, and her Ex falls for a messy bout of sex with a pastry chef.

He is distraught, falls unconscious outside and freezes off one of his toes.

For inexplicable reasons, the college professor has a Dr. Jekyll moment, and our heroine leaves him.

She runs back to San Fran to find her old buddy who is firmly engaged in another relationship, but drops his current honey to take back the selfish monster that he was with for five years.

Its never a good sign when you find yourself thinking that a film feels long while you're still watching it. However, a great beginning and great ending mostly make up for the pacing problems in the middle. The chemistry between Blunt and Segel is a delight to watch and Alison Brie steals the show as Blunts hilarious sister (demonstrating a ""so cute its ridiculous"" British accent in the process).

Despite the fact that the movie isn't quite gross enough for Apatow fans and will be a little too silly for those expecting a straight-up rom-com, its still worth a watch, especially for Segal/Blunt fans.",1431561600,,791,4.7101449275362315

4739000,3,B005LAIHEA,"The Five-Year Engagement is a watchable movie but it could have been edited a bit time wise, as it does drag on a bit in parts. I didn't look at how long the movie was before watching it but noticed it was getting a lot later than I thought it would be when I was only what turned out to be about three quarters through. Longer movies aren't always a bad thing, but I think if you don't notice the clock ticking than it's not an issue but at times you do notice The Five-Year Engagement dragging on. I mean how many times did we need to relive the pink bunny, Princess Diana party scenes? The movie goes for over two hours and does drag a little between each of the set up to be humorous scenes.

Siegel doesn't break any new acting ground with his character Tom, who you've experienced before if you've watched most other couple based films he's been in, just with a different name and occupation. Basically a good natured guy who is a bit of a doormat to the woman in his life. In this one he's a successful San Francisco chef who follows his fianc&eacute;e's career dreams to Michigan only to find people laughing at him or taking advantage of him when he asks for work in the industry. The only place he can find work is at a hamburger joint that of course all of his wife's colleagues are familiar with. Tom hates it there and doesn't feel he is fulfilling the male role in the relationship. Of course his girlfriend Violet (Emily Blunt) is not only oblivious to the problem, but gets annoyed by the changes in Tom to fit in with his new Michigan colleagues and friends. Meanwhile their former best friends who weren't into each other at all but slept together and have a baby on the way are living more of Tom and Violet's dream than they are.

I found the best friend's who remained in San Francisco relationship to be a lot less believable, especially when Alex is recounting his interactions with Alison that he pressured her to abort the baby, then to adopt it out. I can't see a person who obviously had the opposite outlook on life not just becoming a single parent and trying to hook up with someone else down the track, especially when the best friends that linked them socially aren't around anymore. If they both wanted the baby that would have been the link of course but I just didn't see it plausible that they'd be together.",1422230400,,2344,4.386206896551724

Same with the funny moments in this movie. It's almost like the actors had a lot of fun, but it seems like watching an extended rehearsal. It's oddly disengaged (no pun intended) from the audience. And it is LONG. Longer than the actual clock time, which is some kind of quantum warp they accomplished. I think I laughed five times, chuckled six times, and smiled indulgently often. Then I started browsing online too, which made the movie go faster. Note: I like BOTH of these actors, a lot, so I wanted to like this movie a lot. Near the end, I admit I said out loud, ""Is this thing EVER going to be over?"" I also muted the volume for the last five or so minutes so I could focus on browsing the internet.

This film has captured the random chaos of love for this generation.  Putting things off until their ""right,"" and always finding a reason to postpone vs a shotgun wedding and making it work.  I feel I've seen this story play out all around me.

Not only being incredibly true in tone for this generation, the characters are honest and real.  Even the bit parts are acted out with fully developed characters.  Everyone knew who they were.

Maybe it was the tone.  Maybe it was the honesty.  Maybe it was the acting, but I laughed hard, out loud, many many times while watching this movie.  I give it my highest recommendation.",1372896000,3,666,4.475

4739837,2,B005LAIHEA,"Long story short: Tom (Jason Segel; Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Jeff Who Lives At Home) and Violet (gorgeous Emily Blunt; The Devil Wears Prada, The Wolfman) are an engaged couple who's upcoming wedding day keeps getting delayed for various reasons.  Through deaths, careers, and education, family and friends begin to wonder whether or not Tom and Violet are ever going to walk down the aisle.  And, you know what, so did I.

While the performances are great and the overall story is interesting enough, the biggest problems here are pacing and structure.  The movie is all over the place.  The story feels very episodic as, in one scene while taking care of her niece, Violet is shot in the leg with an arrow.  Obviously, Alex (Chris Pratt; Wanted, ""Parks and Recreation""), Tom's best friend and father to Violet's niece, is pissed that Tom's negligence led to the accidental shooting.  Then suddenly we flash cut to Alex toasting Tom for being a great guy.  This type of editing makes you forget that you're watching a movie and not a soap opera which also helps to contribute to the overlong run time.  Through out the duration of the movie, I kept wanting to either look at the clock or found myself thinking about something else entirely.  Jokes are repeated.  ""Don't worry, they'll live.""  Jump to a funeral.  ""At least no one died"".  Once again, another funeral and still no wedding.  Tom grows a really fake looking, Yosammitti Sam beard anc mustache.  On the sleeve is reprinted Owen Gleiberman's glowing blurb, ""Lively, Original, and Hilarious.""  Did we see the same movie?  More like ""Dead, Cliched, With Moments of Comedy.""  This may be good enough to watch once but I wouldn't add it to my collection.",1369180800,,1714,4.828178694158075

The time-passing sequences of spring scenes, summer, fall foliage  and snowy winter trees made me initially think that it was more like 10 years of time passing.  Although it's quite possible I just stopped paying attention..

There were many wonderfully clever moments... but they never managed to connect.  Dakota Fanning, Chris Parnell, Molly Shannon (don't blink) and many other actors have wonderful moments.  But, then... the scene ends.  Maybe that's the bottom line for me with this film:  You could ""feel"" the structure of it, instead of it rolling along seemingly effortlessly.

Its hard not to hate the main pairing and for whatever reason I never wanted them to unite.  At one point his parents point out that not even 60% compatibility is needed for a couple to survive.

If this maxim is true then why even bother rooting for anyone.  Just pick random people and stick with it.  The ""B"" couple with kids seem much better a story to focus on and I think the writing missed a chance there.

I had hoped this would be better. I thought it was funny that the previews show the niece in one scene using a current reference that in the movie didn't exist. While this was great marketing to show the movie was relevant, it made the movie seem disingenuous. It started out with a premise that seemed to make sense and then Segel's character just got weird in the middle. It was as if this would make the movie funnier but in reality it simply made it sad. Why would a top chef who would be capable of running his own restaurant under the ownership of another chef be willing to take a sandwich job and not simply find a restaurant rental and create his own vision? He obviously knew how to run a kitchen and a business from a managerial point. Oh well. I watched it. I laughed some...I was happy with how it ended.

4740466,4,B005LAIHEA,"As he previously demonstrated in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" Jason Segel, who co-wrote the script here, has a keen eye for relationships and what does and does not make them tick.  In our minds eye it's all sugar and spice and everything nice on the road from first glance to the altar but nothing could be further from the truth.  The central couple Tom (Segel) and Violet (Emily Blunt) have a live-in relationship that's virtually blissful so the next logical step would be matrimony.  From the moment Violet says yes to Tom's proposal things start to unravel.  The sticking point is Violet accepting an internship at the behavioral science department at Michigan State University.  Tom has a terrific job as a chef at a ritzy eatery in San Francisco.  It comes down to Tom biting the bullet and letting Violet pursue her dream.  It's not long before resentment and jealousy set in.  Tom degenerates into a Ted Nugent wannabe by hunting big game with a crossbow.  Violet tries to reassure Tom that there's nothing going on between her and her department head(Rhys Ifans).  The pitfalls of the reversal of gender roles is numerous.  I found the film daring in its portrayal warts and all of Tom and Violet's relationship.  This is an imperfect film, however, because it looks like some honcho at the studio took their pencil to the script and gave it an abruptly absurd happy ending.  The ending negates practically everything that came before and answers none of the sticking points that came into play with Tom and Violet's union.  If possible forget the sweetness and niceness of the film's closing minutes and remember the more thought provoking aspects that preceded it.",1358985600,,1676,4.876325088339223
4740467,3,B005LAIHEA,"Violet (Emily Blunt) and Tom (Fason SEgel) are always postponing their marriage because other seemingly more important things have come up.

Violet gets an opportunity to do post doctorate for two years. Tom gives up a promotion and they both move from San Francisco to Michigan. Violet does very well, her professor Winton (Rhys Ifans) extends her contract while Tom languishes at a sandwich bar and hunts deer for kicks.

Along the way, Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Platt) and Violet's sister Susie (Alison Brie) get married and have kids. Their respective grandparents die. Tom and Violet moves apart and see other people.

Well, the five years here is quite a long time, and I actually got the impression the longer film English Patient was shorter.

I just thought that the characters should have realised right from the start that it is possible to balance career, marriage and kids all at the same time. They and the viewers have to take a long and winding journey to realise this. But everyone is entitled to make their own choices and live as they see fit.

Some funny moments save the movie - such as the nymphomaniac and hyper bunny Audrey (Dakota Johnson). I was also tickled pink by Tom's foul mouthed mom. In the spirit of Farrelly brothers, there's a really weird bearded man and his verbal faux pas.

The middle where they were in Michigan and Jason was trying to find himself was a little long in the tooth and then the ending felt very rushed but overall, due to the actors, I found it to be an entertaining film.",1358380800,,514,4.15

Don't get me wrong, there are a few funny parts in the movie, but overall it had more of a gloomy tone to it throughout the majority of the movie.

The sole good thing, the scenes with university work colleagues were sometimes funny. Otherwise, it was tedious, and at times, painful (for the characters, literally). To sum it up: This is what Hollywood thinks of Michigan. Jason Segal (sp? Don't care enough to google) is only 32? I couldn't decide whether he was playing someone older. (The maturity level personality-wise argues against it.) He looks like crap. I never much liked, and stopped watching the popular sitcom he is on years ago (though I recall that he is the least annoying character on it) but he is such a TV actor. Then, the plot! I kept wishing the couple would break up and stay that way. Someone who makes $18.50 per hour (in San Francisco) has the money to fly to funerals in England?

I wish I could give a better description but really I just lost interest in the first 20 minutes and rest is a blur when I try to remember it.

One thing I can add is that we rented this on Amazon Video and continue to have a great experience with it.  We use a PS3 as our Blu-ray and ome media player.",1357344000,,549,3.857142857142857

4740841,4,B005LAIHEA,"One of the big reasons I found this movie funny was because of the concept of having a significant other move to a whole new part of the country to be with you.  That person learning a new culture and geography with the motivation being the status of the relationship vs something they personally want is a huge part of this movie and something I definitely related to.

But there is also that true to life aspect of it, in which things don't always go perfectly in life, and people will be able to relate. It also gets a little dark for awhile. I will admit that when I first saw it I was a little worried that i might not turn back up. Then it would have fallen into that category of movies that seems to want to rub your face in the fact that life sucks. I would say it is not bad to acknowledge that life is not always perfect, but being that people go to the movies to escape reality to a degree, it is not a good message

4741498,4,B005LAIHEA,"Overall The Five-Year Engagement is a very good movie. It's very funny and both the plot and character development are very well done. There are only two very minor reasons it lost one star from me. First, there are some parts that seem to drag a little long which breaks the pacing at times. Second, it seems to me that there is one to many uses of ""jump cuts"" for my taste. Neither of these issues takes away from the movie overall, but it does keep it from getting that 5th star from me.",1355875200,,490,4.223404255319149

Worth watching at least once! Good overall performances by all the actors, you'll love the characters and the story right away. I found myself laughing throughout the movie, this movie is better than a lot of comedies of today that have a drab love storyline of fall in love, problem arises, then the characters make things better. The story line in this movie is great and I found myself relating to a lot of the happenings and actual things couples go through if you ever have been in a relationship.

You may know people like these ficticious losers in real life, in fact, right now as your read this, he or she may be reading this review and sitting in your chair. Even if you identify with the subject matter, this pathetic scenario is not good fodder for a film, which, by definition, is for entertainment.

This movie was so incredibly unfunny I just had to get it off my chest and write a review. Whether anyone is helped by this review or even reads it doesn't really matter. The main thing is I got to spew about it. The story is boy meets girl, falls in love, asks girl to marry him, she agrees but has to move to Michigan from San Francisco for school. They move, they stifle each other, fight, break up. He moves back to San Fran opens a taco truck is a huge success has a dumb girlfriend who is too young for him and she moves in with her professor. It's all very boring. It's all way too long. It's not very funny. I like both the leads in this movie so I thought I'd give it a try.

4742438,2,B005LAIHEA,"Recently watched movie review:
*The Five-Year Engagement (2012)- 2/5

The Five-Year Engagement is a romantic comedy that Nicholas Stoller produced, wrote (with the help of Jason Segal), and directed; It stars Jason Segal and Emily Blunt. Tom Solomon (Jason Segal) and Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt) are a happy couple who live in San Francisco. Tom and Violet are trying to plan a wedding, but before plans are final, Violet gets accepted into a psychology program at the University of Michigan. Tom, who is a chef at a fancy restaurant, isn't pleased when he finds out there are no fancy restaurants for him to work at in Michigan. Years pass, and Violet finds out the psychology program is going to last longer than expected, so wedding plans will have to wait a little bit longer, and when Tom finds out, he gets sodisillusioned with his life.

Jason Segal and Emily Blunt work well together, and are a likeable pair, with a warm-like chemistry. The writing is funny and smart, but then there are times when it's not. There are times where you'll laugh, won't laugh, and don't know if you should laugh; the movie tries so hard to be funny when most of it is just awkward instead. The supporting cast of Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Pratt) and Violet's sister Suzie (Alison Brie) do an awesome job, many times stealing the show. There's a lot of uniqueness put into the film in terms of props and costumes, and I couldn't wait to see what other unique things were going to show up.

The Five-Year Engagement feels like a long waiting game; at 124 minutes, you'll find yourself ready for the film to be over with. The film doesn't do a good job in explaining what's stopping Tom and Violet from getting married, which causes the main story to be rather uninteresting and feel sloppy. I was more interested in hearing what the next joke was going to be, and what the next new unique thing was going be, rather than caring if they were ever going to get married. For a movie that's not about sports, I couldn't help but constantly feel overwhelmed with product placements; I felt like I was watching commercials for the University of Michigan, the movie Ratatouille, Michigan restaurants, and some classic metal bands, thus resulting in getting a thumbs down. If you want to laugh a few times, but feel bored at the same time, I'm going to mildly recommend a 'rent.' Otherwise, it gets a 'pass.'",1353628800,,2392,4.6635071090047395
4742667,2,B005LAIHEA,"I thought this movie was okay. It could have been a lot better, but the acting was a little stiff and failed to draw me into the storyline.

I do not want to be a spoiler but the whole movie is based on her getting promoted and then has a cheat with her teacher.  He moves on and does his dream job which is cooking and she misses him for them to both finally meet back up after trying to move on with other people.,1353456000,,444,3.8260869565217392

I liked the flash backs to when the couple first met, yes, it was done more than once, but it seemed to tie everything back around to that one important moment.

The only part I did not care for was the Spanish song sung at the sister's wedding and REALLY did not like it at the end. I saw the point it created at the sister's wedding, but the song sucks and I hate that it ended on that note. The use of Into the Mystic was great. All they had to do was cut the film off at the first kiss on NYE after they finished the couple's wedding scene. That would have been better.",1352332800,,746,4.074829931972789

Segel perfectly captures a man's perspective in a relationship nowadays, but also writes his female characters as well-rounded and honest, without any misogynistic overtones. Also, he can write very honest, and often dark aspects to a relationship while still making the story funny. An interesting factoid to this film is that the skeevy man who is a threat to Tom (Segel) and Violet's (Blunt) relationship is a British college professor and if you listen to Segel's commentary for ""Sarah Marshall,"" he says that originally Sarah's new boyfriend was not a rock star (Brand), but a British college professor. It wasn't until Russell Brand came in to audition that Segel decided to rewrite the part for Brand. In this film the professor is portrayed by the wonderful Rhys Ifans (who is Welsh in real life). All of the characters in this film are well-written, well-played -- especially by Chris Pratt (NBC's ""Parks and Recreation"") and Alison Brie (NBC's ""Community""/AMC's ""Mad Men"") -- and I especially liked how the story went into a dark place, with the two characters actually separating. I think this was a very well-done comedy that both women and men would enjoy.

4743849,2,B005LAIHEA,"""The Five Year Engagemnt"" is basically a re-hashing of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" BUT LESS FUNNY. Jason Segel repeats his roll as the nice, sweet male character victimized by life & a powerful independent woman. He slides down from a successful career minded position in life to the basement level of loser-ness only to pick himself back up at the end; when he again realizes he's the person responsible for his life, which of course was & is a good one, in-fact better than most. ( And on a side note, what's with Jason Segel's need to write himself naked in all of his movies.

Yes it did seem longer than Dr. Zhivago.  No it won't make you laugh out loud (well, once in
a while I DID, but then, I'm easy).  This movie uses as theme songs the LESS WELL LIKED
Van Morrison songs.  Either this director was working hard at low expectations, or this is a
new form of uber-snobbishness.  Besides, how many of the audience will actually know both
Van Morrison and Wham! (?)  Perhaps it IS all a social psychology experiment designed to make
you, the audience, feel like you are no more in control of your life than the main characters
in the movie are, and that's the message.  Dramatic peak of the film: Jason Segel's impassioned
donut speech.  Most prolongued cute scene: the two sisters arguing in Elmo and Cookie Monster
voices.  Emily Blunt is very cute; Jason still has his man-boy thing going on.  Watch the
movie and all of this will make sense.  It's OK but it helps to lower you expectations going into it.",1349136000,2,1028,4.478494623655914

They try and sell this movie as a lighthearted comedy, but it's anything but.  It's actually quite long and some parts are just plain depressing (no laughs at all).

But the plot turns became farcical as the man ""bottomed out"" during his three years of living in a small town for his fiancee, and became some sort of disturbed Unibomber-type character that made very little sense.  Nor did the ending make sense, when the couple decided to reunite and let their problems ""work themselves out"".  The cast did a great job, and the movie was entertaining and funny, which is why I'm going with 4 stars (I think 3.5 would be most accurate, actually).  But it was hard to buy into Jason Segel's character transformation in Michigan.  It was also a let-down to see the movie avoid any actual discussion of the real issues involved in balancing the career demands of a couple where both are professionals with highly demanding careers.  It's a pity that the movie avoided actually looking at the problems faced by the couple and went for the cheap laughs instead.",1349049600,,1106,4.739583333333333

They have lots of good reasons for postponing their wedding, everything from moving, to injury and even a breakup. This is a painfully long, slow and dull movie. It has witty moments, but nothing that feels laugh out loud funny moments. More like amusing. The two main characters are to normal and or bland to be all that captivating for a romantic comedy that is longer than 2 hours.

4744357,3,B005LAIHEA,"This movie has a great cast and concept, but gets lost along the way and ends up very uneven. Jason Segal's chef plays opposite Emily Blunt's psychology doctorate student. Soon after they get engaged she is offered her dream spot in a doctorate program in Michigan, so he gives up his promising career as a chef in San Francisco to follow her there. The change leaves their relationship unbalanced, and they can never quite regain their footing, and commit to finally marrying. The movie traces their ups and downs, and the route they finally take to the alter.

There's a lot of relationship truth in this movie, but not a lot of laughs. Some wacky scenes feel thrown in to try and bring the laugh factor up but end up feeling out of place - one in which Jason Segal's character is serving venison stew and home-made honey in deer hooves comes to mind. I found the chemistry between Segal and Blunt uneven also - at times it worked, but in other scenes they felt awkward with each other. I think their comedic strengths are different - hers is timing and a sharp tongue while his is more goofy. My favorite comedic scene of Blunt's was actually not with Segal but with co-star Alison Brie (Community, Mad Men), who plays her sister, in a scene where they are impersonating Elmo and Cookie Monster while having a relationship heart-to-heart.

Also, this movie has a great supporting cast, Alison Brie (Community) and Chris Pratt (Moneyball) do a great job of taking stage when Jason Segel and Emily Blunt aren't the center of attention. My only complaint is that Kevin Hart was way under used in this movie, but I like that he was in it at all which was a surprise to me since they failed to mention him in any commercials they played for this movie.

In a role reversal, he gives up his career so she can do her doctorate studies at the University of Michigan for a couple of years. They put off getting married while Michigan turns Tom into Grizzly Adams. Meanwhile Susan (Alison Brie) who is Violet's sister gets married to the somewhat crude Alex (Chris Pratt) a friend and co-worker of Tom.

The humor moves from clever to awkward to bad. There is a doughnut metaphor that starts in the middle of the film, that has moments of cleverness. The extreme overreaction of the main characters due to minor difficulties is perhaps the downfall of the film. While the film needed to create conflict, it did so in an inane manner that was neither funny nor realistic. Emily Blunt gives us a good performance.

4744470,1,B005LAIHEA,"The Five-Year Engagement is labeled as a ""slapstick comedy"" but there is little comedy and more sadness to the movie.  The premise of the movie is that Violet and Tom are engaged but postpone getting married because Violet needs to move from San Francisco to Michigan where she has received a teaching fellowship. Dutifully, Tom goes with Violet giving up an outstand job as a chief for making sandwiches at a fast food joint.  Even though Violet and Tom are together, their wedding is postponed while Tom's friend Alex married Violet's sister Suzie and start a family, providing a contrast to the unmarried Violet and Tom.  Violet's stint in Michigan is to last for two years during which time they inexplicably don't get married.  It would have been funnier if they were separate in California and Michigan and had bizarre incidents trying to see each other.  It is hard to understand what is tripping them up on their way to the altar.

Scenes in the movie that could have been given a funny twist are grim. Tom goes out hunting with one of his new Michigan friends and shoots a deer in the head. The deer is roped to the roof of his friend's car and slides off so Tom has to put the deer in his car with its head sticking out of the sunroof. It would have been funny if the deer charged Tom or that the deer was not dead but stunned and wakes up in the car with Tom.  The movie is made up of scenes like this that simply fall flat.  I am glad I did not see the movie when it was in theaters.  At least I could turn it off",1347235200,2,1525,4.285714285714286
4744471,5,B005LAIHEA,"I really liked this movie quite a bit more than I expected to.  It is one of those movies that I will be quoting and mentioning the funny bits for years to come.

After Forgetting Sarah Marshall and I Love You Man, I thought Jason Segel's character would be another of those broadly drawn, vaguely gross and occasionally clueless dudes.  Instead he is very believable, somewhat subdued and quite attractive, but not in a conventional way.  It really is quite an impressive performance.  Emily Blunt has glammed down a bit, if that term makes sense, so we are able to witness the evolution of a very realistic relationship between two people who love each other very much and whose own ambitions create barriers to their being together.  Although the movie is often quite funny, Judd Apatow shows a refreshing unwillingness to go for the cheap joke.  This couple struggles together to work it out, not too differently from the way ""typical"" young couples today have their struggles.  People have to deal with their attractions to others, they get drunk and make stupid decisions, they give up jobs and comfortable lifestyles to move to where their loved one is, they try it apart but never stop loving each other.

I am not a fan of Bridesmaids and hate that it is being held up as the modern prototype for a comedy with strong female characters.  It is just way too gross for me.  So I approached the Unrated version of The Five-Year Engagement with some trepidation.  Even with the extra envelope-pushing, I still felt like it was a relatively realistic and touching portrayal of a modern relationship.

It has been mentioned in previous reviews, but I do feel that the conversation between Violet and her sister in which they are both using Sesame Street voices is a little piece of comic genius.  Not only is it funny, but it beautifully encapsulates these characters and also creates a critical plot point.  You can't ask for more from a scene.  I also loved the ending.  It could have seemed rushed and abrupt, but I really thought it was perfect and organic.  The movie is longish but the pacing seems just about right.  I am happy to find a movie that exceeded my expectations and that I can recommend highly.",1347235200,,2216,4.694300518134715

Genre: 7 Movie: 6

What's it about?
Exactly one year after Tom Solomon meets Violet Barnes, he surprises her with a ring. By all accounts, Tom and Violet are destined for their happily ever after. However, this engaged couple just keep getting tripped up on the long walk down the aisle.

What did I think?
I loved the beginning and the end, but in the middle was a lot of fluff and filler to make the audience feel as if this engagement...and movie...have gone on far too long.  As I was watching the film, I couldn't help but remember the romantic comedy that kept playing in ""Friends with Benefits""; which has Jason Segel in it. I kept saying ""Flapjack"" all the way through.  It is worth renting if you can suffer through to the end...that was great!",1347148800,,894,4.591194968553459
4744544,2,B005LAIHEA,"I've never written a review on Amazon before. I can't say much about this film other than for what should be a knockout comedic cast, it is amazingly boring and slow. I think the director imagined the humor would be found in the characters' quirky, offbeat dialogue, except the dialogue isn't funny or quirky. It's like watching the life of two semi-funny people, minus any interesting parts. I want my 3.99 back.",1347062400,3,413,4.75

Emily Blunt's character and her sister having a serious conversation about relationships in Elmo and Cookie Monster voices. Pure comedic genius.

The rest of the movie was just ok. Some scenes were very contrived and cheesy. I'm a big fan of Jason Segel, but I think he could have chosen another lead actor who would've have more chemistry with Emily Blunt and was more in shape.",1347062400,,502,4.566666666666666

SPOILER ALERT!!

Basically, two hours headed exactly where you'd expect. Up until the end, it's 'people behaving dumb'. Really; the venison dinner? the muttonchops? the chase of the professor? the food slapping scene? Losing a toe???

Emily Blunt has to give up her career dream to be happy. A woman giving up her goals to enjoy true love. THERE'S a new idea! HE runs a taco truck (instead of running a major restaurant). Ok, but...they're happy. We could have saved them five years, and just shown them the last 5 pages of the script early on.

Do something new! Tell this tired story in a different way, throw in a twist or two in. Or at least, make it funnier... Give people like Mindy Kaling or Molly Shannon something more to do; why waste talent? Give Brian Posehn a break at the end (instead of just leaving him pathetic; oh wait! That's funny..). And the leads...they deserve better.

The drama scenes fit in perfectly and they do not slow down the movie or make you forget it's a comedy which is the problem with most comedies like this. There are a few classic scenes in this (the Cookie Monster vs. Elmo argument is my favorite) and this is one that you can watch more then once and still laugh at every time.

Those kind of roles are meant to be done by actors like Zach Galifanakis or Jonah Hill or Jack Black but Segal isn't exactly your typical unemployed stoner who sits out on a couch all day long. Anyway, I was very curious what they would do with this film. Of course it is a chick film but it is also relevant for considering my age. I saw this last night and there were atleast three scenes which had me laughing out loud. The story is very curiously tuned just enough to pique your interest and keep you in it. Some may find sitting through 2 hours 11 minutes a bit too long but I don't think they would sustain the title of the film and the message if they didn't make it that long. At around 1 hour 30 minutes I did look at my clock thinking where are they going to take this now. But then that is my only criticism. I loved the acting, it was outstanding.

4744590,4,B005LAIHEA,"There is such a ramshackle charm to this 2012 romantic comedy that I think the term ""Apatovian"" seems appropriate to describe it since it most definitely feels like the same general creative team led by producer Judd Apatow that guided&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000YIBYBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-People/dp/B002U5QCJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny People</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridesmaids/dp/B00466HN7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridesmaids</a>. All the ingredients of the successful Apatovian formula are here - likeable principal characters facing the unpredictability of life's events, the familiar challenges of maintaining relationships in a morass of doubt and temptation, the unexpected detours into graphic humor, the pool of scene-stealing comic actors, the slightly overlong running time (this one clocks in at 124 minutes). Directed by Nicholas Stoller (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forgetting-Sarah-Marshall/dp/B001L2IFVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a>), this particular one focuses on a young couple a year into their relationship - Tom Solomon, a talented sous-chef at a trendy San Francisco restaurant, and Violet Barnes, a psychology graduate student hoping to win a postdoctoral fellowship at Berkeley.

The movie opens with Tom popping the question on the bayside terrace of his restaurant and Violet responding affirmatively without hesitation. Thanks to the stars' easy charms, the characters are obviously quite compatible and in love. What happens from that point forward is less about formula and more about just life. Berkeley turns Violet down, but she eventually wins a fellowship in a two-year program at Michigan. Tom willingly gives up his much-sought-after job and moves cross-country with Violet to Ann Arbor. She thrives under the tutelage of the suspiciously charming Prof. Winton Childs amid her motley study group. Tom, on the other hand, flails mightily in trying to fit into his new surroundings, eventually landing a lowly job at a sandwich shop and turning into a grizzly-looking house-husband who takes up hobbies like deer hunting and sweater knitting.

While their dilemma doesn't represent new material to the big screen, the treatment of the subject - as co-written by Stoller and star Jason Segel - is uncommonly well handled with plenty of room for awkward moments filled with both humor and honest emotion. If the film drags, as it occasionally does in the last third, it's because they focus a little too liberally on the principals' relationships with the incidental characters. As Tom, Segel has improved considerably as a leading man since his gangly turn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forgetting-Sarah-Marshall/dp/B001L2IFVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a>, bringing acuity to his character's increasing struggle between devotion and resentment. Emily Blunt brings a welcome softness and open awkwardness to her heretofore crystalline screen persona, and the two actors achieve a natural rapport that brings a centered relatability to their evolving characters. They are surrounded by a crack company of comic actors.

Chris Pratt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parks-Recreation/dp/B003L77GE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parks & Recreation</a>) brings goofball energy to Tom's wildly inappropriate chef colleague-turned-brother-in-law Alex, while Alison Brie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Men/dp/B0038M2AOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Men</a>) sports a convincing Brit accent and an off-kilter manner to her hilarious portrayal of Violet's impulsive sister Suzie. One of the film's funniest scenes involves Violet and Suzie having a tense discussion while speaking in the voices of Elmo and Cookie Monster in order to avoid alarming Suzie's daughter. As Childs, Rhys Ifans (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Notting-Hill/dp/B000023VTP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Notting Hill</a>) brings the right level of smarminess to his erudite professor, while Mindy Kaling, Kevin Hart, and Randall Park play Violet's fellow PhD candidates with sharp jabs of humor. In a few memorably funny scenes, Brian Posehn plays the oddball sandwich shop owner and Chris Parnell is Tom's too-comfortable fellow house-husband. The movie wraps up on a somewhat pat note rather quickly, but it maintains its goodwill to the very last.",1337126400,28,4746,6.9463986599664995
4744591,4,B005LAIHEA,"""The Five-Year Engagement"" is at first, not what I expected, at least in its entirety. While it is very funny, it is nowhere near the comedy movie that you would expect from Jason Segel (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Bad Teacher, Knocked Up) who wrote, starred and produced this movie, or Judd Apatow who produced ""Engagement"" as well as ""Bridesmaids"", ""Step Brothers"" & ""Pineapple Express"", among others. You can definitely see the similarities in style between ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Engagement"".

Emily Blunt has made a career off of dramatic roles in movies like ""Charlie Wilson's War"", ""The Young Victoria"" & ""The Wolfman"". So I was anxious to see her finally do something where she could be funny and less dramatic on screen. I had seen her in a little movie called ""Wild Target"" a few months back and she was hilarious and as the brits would say, `charming', in the film. I was hoping for that and more, but got a bit less than I was expecting.

Blunt plays Violet Barnes and Segel plays Tom Solomon, two people with their whole lives ahead of them that meet at a New Year's Eve Party dressed as a giant pink super bunny and Princess Diana. Their chemistry is natural in the film. In fact, what ""Engagement"" does right is be funny, entertaining and quirky, all the while being very real, as far as relationships go. That is the draw of the film. Relationships aren't always glorious, shiny and silhouetted by marvelous sunsets, like portrayed in the movies. They are dirty and at times sad. They are complicated. There is give and take and sometimes the give and the take changes who you are.

I do recommend ""The Five-Year Engagement"" but I do this by making sure you know that you aren't going to get ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". The movie is unique in its own right. It is as unique as the characters in the film. The movie may be a little long, but in that time, you will grow close to the people in the film and you will relate to them and see yourselves at many times. ""Engagement"" is more of a commentary on life and choices than a burst out comedy. Emily Blunt and Jason Segel did a splendid job in a film that may disappoint some, but others will find to be endearing and something that could be watched many times.",1336435200,5,2241,4.58354114713217
4744592,3,B005LAIHEA,"The movie is mainly a comedy yet it has an edge if you look closely. There are a myriad of different takes in how you view it. Some of it felt dark but always with the comedy overlining it. The things I liked about it were, the carefree easy way the main characters were together, they had a bond which felt like not being alone but really with a partner. They had fun together and allowed themselves to show silliness and playfulness. I liked the Pink Bunny Costume and kind of the flat affect that went along with it, at the couple's first encounter. I liked when the male lead tried to find himself hunting, letting everything fall apart in a funny way. I don't like to kill animals but I think it would be fun to hunt animals that are not alive so you could have the experience. I liked when he made a hunting feast even though his guests weren't in the spirit of the party, although he wasn't either although he was still using his creativity. I liked the big cups that looked like coconuts and the big serving utensils with the animal skins on them. The big bowl of wild game stew. It was fun. I liked when he went and stuffed himself with all kinds of beautiful wedding cakes, different colors and tastes. He made friends that were in touch with their feminine sides. I also love fresh orange juice, and I loved the tinkling champagne glasses with everflowing beautiful juice. The movie is easy to watch and could help some unwind.

4744593,4,B005LAIHEA,"Teaming up again in another adult comedy, Nicholas Stoller (director, co-writer) and Jason Segel (co-writer, actor) prove that ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was no fluke.  They manage to have just the right amount of raunchiness mixed in with over-the-top and subtle humor and enough drama and sweetness to keep most people happy.  Tom (Segel) is a San Francisco chef, on the verge of getting his own restaurant, who proposes to his girlfriend of one year, Violet.  Violet (great as usual Emily Blunt) is an ex-pat Brit working as an educator in the field of psychology.  She obtains a grant to obtain her doctorate at the University of Michigan and Tom gives up his own career opportunity to move with Violet to Ann Arbor.

After a struggle with Michigan winters and Tom's inability to get a decent job, he descends to the brink of craziness with the help of a househusband he meets played by Chris Parnell.  Violet on the other hand is very successful, perhaps aided by her boss (Rhys Ifans) who has a crush on her.  Tom and Violet's pre-marital struggles keep the wedding date constantly moving.  Complicating matters is the pressure from both sides of the family.  Violet's London based family is losing aging members left and right and Tom's Jewish-rooted parents are longing for a traditional marriage.

Perhaps the funniest pair however is Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Pratt from TV's ""Parks and Recreation"") and Violet's sister (Alison Brie from TV's ""Mad Men"" and ""Community"").  At an early rehearsal dinner the unlikely couple hooks up, quickly marry in a beautifully conceived wedding and have a couple kids before Tom and Violet can pick out their own wedding cake.  The movie runs long at a little over 2 hours which might have been forgivable if we spent a little more time with Alex and Suzie (Brie) or Lauren Weedman's Chef Sally, Tom's lesbian (""but I voted against California's gay marriage act"") boss.  Judd Apatow is one of the producers and we can certainly see his influence.  Ultimately the movie is a worthy addition to the genre, even if we get a little too much of Tom and Violet's Michigan struggles and that the humor misses some of the time.",1335744000,,2169,4.827027027027027
