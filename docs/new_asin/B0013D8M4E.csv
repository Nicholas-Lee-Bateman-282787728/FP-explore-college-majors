3103569,4,B0013D8M4E,"Unlike some of the people who write reviews about a show, I have actually WATCHED this! So we all know that we want to see the original series on dvd, but for now this is what we have. No, it wasn't perfect. Kind of a weak plot, and I never really cared for Charles Franks' take on being a Maverick, but this show was really helped by having James Garner and Jack Kelly in it. James has always been the favorite of mine as far as the 4 Mavericks, but Jack still looked good after all those years, and did a fine job here (albeit short)! And while Susan Sullivan was no match for Jodie Foster (1994 Maverick Movie, Annabelle) she did a good job! All in all a decent movie. Too bad the tv series wasn't as good!",1267747200,11,709,4.107913669064748

It wasn't the best MOW ever filmed but it was entertaining and interesting to watch. I would recommend it, not because I was involved, but because it is a fun movie to watch.

3103571,3,B0013D8M4E,"When this show was released on VHS in 1994 it was a ""Director's Cut"". which had added scenes and was 110 minutes in length. The version released on DVD is only 92 minutes long. Couldn't Warner Brothers have at least released the longer version of this show?",1224979200,15,257,4.48936170212766
3103572,3,B0013D8M4E,"This 1978 made for TV film is heavy on nostalgia and charm but weak on plot. James Garner, who had played Brett Maverick in the original ""Maverick"" series from 1957 to 1960, returned to the role after 18 years. Fans of Garner and/or the original series will be pleased to see him back in the role that made him famous. Overall, however, ""The New Maverick"" is a disappointment, suffering as it does from a conflict of purpose.

The film introduces Charles Frank as Ben Maverick, son of cousin Beau Maverick (played by Roger Moore in the original series). The ostensible goal of ""The New Maverick"" was to serve as a pilot for a series starring Frank, but Garner steals the show, such as it is. Frank can't begin to match Garner's charm and wit. The paper-thin plot revolves around the Mavericks entering a chase for a shipment of stolen gatling guns. Jack Kelly returns as Brett's brother Bart, but his arrival with only 14 minutes left in the film has the feeling of an extended cameo. Susan Sullivan shines in a supporting role as Poker Alice, a card player who is Brett's match at the table.

The ""Young Maverick"" series that this film spawned lasted all of eight episodes the next season. Television executives finally realized the public didn't want Maverick without Garner, and he returned to the role one more time for a revival of the series in the 1981-82 season. (Trivia: Hy Averback, who directed this film, also directed several episodes of M*A*S*H* and was the voice heard over the camp loudspeaker in that series.)--William C.

3103573,4,B0013D8M4E,What a joy it was to see James Garner return to the role that made him famous!  The character has aged like fine wine and the sharp Garner tongue is still firmly planted in the cheek.  I agree only in part with the other reviewers - we do want to see the original Maverick on DVD!  But this will serve as a nice appetizer until the main course comes along.  And personally I can't see reviewing a product that you have not bothered to take the time to watch.,1213574400,45,458,4.112359550561798

3103631,3,B0013D8M4E,"I remember when this made-for-TV was hyped prior to airing. The commercials kept touting the return of the Maverik brothers. I so looked forward to watching it. Probably based on how much I looked forward to it I remember being totally disappointed. The plot was weak and full of holes. Yes James Garner was the highlight of the show and it was great to see him as Bret again. But Charles Frank, who was going to star in the series this pilot was filmed for never seemed to fit into the role. Add to that the ""reunion"" of Bret & Bart Maverik occurred when Bart (Jack Kelly) shows up with about 15 minutes left in the film.

Overall I would pass on this unless you are a Bret Maverik freak and want everything that was ever filmed with James Garner in the role. If you're looking for a revival of the old 1957-1962 series you will be very disappointed.",1413504000,,851,4.352201257861635

3103680,4,B0013D8M4E,"I enjoyed this DVD. Always enjoy Jim Garner.

I had purchased the original Maverick complete series through a link to TV Ruby on Amazon, since Amazon didn't have it. I was disappointed with that box set because 9 of 25 disks were unusable. Some episodes were duplicated, and one disk was for the Practice instead of Maverick. The quality of TV Ruby's shows was often poor. Also, none of the disks were usable after the first viewing. They have not responded to my complaints. So don't use TV Ruby if you want a good product.",1336089600,4,524,4.515789473684211
3103681,4,B0013D8M4E,"I'd never seen this TV-movie pilot for THE NEW MAVERICK television series -- a series which ABC decided not to put on their schedule back in 1978. It was to introduce a younger Maverick cousin named Ben -- which is what CBS did a year later with the short-lived YOUNG MAVERICK.

But James Garner is really the star here, and his old TV series partner Jack Kelly as Brother Bart makes a welcome appearance, too. The movie was written by veteran ROCKFORD FILES writer-producer Juanita Bartlett.

So, if you're a fan of either the original MAVERICK (soon to be available on DVD) or the 1981 BRET MAVERICK series, you're likely to enjoy this genial episode. Garner is charming as ever, and it's always a pleasure seeing him playing this character.",1332201600,6,743,4.707692307692308
