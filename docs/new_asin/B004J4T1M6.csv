8431613,1,B004J4T1M6,"This DVD was little more than a History lesson albeit biased about Mr. Dylan . Very little music or performances . Short clips from public domain,no interviews with the musicians . THIS DVD IS NOT ENDORSED BY DYLAN OR HIS CO. !!! TALKING HEADS RAMBLING ON AND ON !!!

8431614,4,B004J4T1M6,"This DVD is one of about six Dylan-related DVDs that have been released over the years by Chrome Dreams. It is one of the better ones, in my opinion, because it has actual video clips (they are clips, not full songs) of Dylan performing - taken from either TV appearances or promotional music videos.

This is part of the ""Under Review"" series which consists of interviews with well known music journalists (Robert Christgau for example) and music biographers (with the occasional recording engineer) discussing an album. They are done in chronological order. This volume brings us pretty much up to date as it was done in 2008 and covers ""Modern Times"". There is some coverage of the Dylan Theme Time Radio Hour (a show I truly love) but surprisingly no mention is ever made of the series producer Eddie Goredetzky, who is the one who searched out the records played and did a lot of the research. While Dylan read the script and is knowledgeable about the songs, it was not all his idea and to overlook Eddie G is wrong.

The ""main feature"" runs 105 minutes and the package lists bonus as including ""extended interviews"" - as well as ""full contributor biographies"". The bios are there as screen text but there are no ""extended interviews"" with the contributors. There is a AUDIO-only press interview with Dylan however.

Dylan fans will get a lot out of the DVD, though it's really something you'll probably play only once.

8431616,1,B004J4T1M6,"The ""Never Ending Narrative 1990-2006"" is, as its title indicates, a video that attempts to portray Dylan's career over roughly a sixteen year period. This is a period that saw many changes in the artist's continual development. The video consists of interviews by journalists and a few musicians who had worked with Dylan during this period. Like its ""sister project"" -- ""Gotta Serve My Time"" -- this video is not worth the time it takes to watch it. The ""Dylan experts"" inflate their egos by dismissing much of the work and misunderstanding almost all of it. Some of the musician's insights are interesting and valuable in understanding the work, but most of the video is weighed down by the gossipy, self-serving opinions of so-called ""Dylan-ologists."" This is not a very insightful or useful video.",1313798400,36,802,4.992537313432836
8431617,5,B004J4T1M6,"The following interchange between poets/writers, Daniel Mark Epstein, Dylan biographer and David Eberhardt, Baltimore poet and activist

originally to dan epstein re his fantabulous bk- underline- The Ballad of Bob Dylan

This letter was sent to the AARP magazine- which had letters congratulating Dylan on his b day from folks like Bono, Maya Angelou, Tom Brokaw, etc. Also it refers to the dvd- which I thoroughly enjoyed. Only good commenter in AARP was Judy Collins'.

A letter like this cannot be printed, by AARP, I would guess, because of its length and its negativity- it would ruin that pablumic, boosteristic format of theirs- which fails to address the real issues of we seniors (us seniors). Too long- too in depth.

I am a member of AARP for what good it does me- (I am already well taken care of)..but mostly I pick up the magazine at dentists' or physical rehab offices and see it the same way I saw the magazines Readers Digest (what ever happened to RD) and Arizona Highways in my youth- 40's, 50's.

The AARP congratz to Bob Dylan fall into the same category- no negativity- not the slightest. O yeh he's an outlaw- an outlaw that has stuck to the same musical format- a droning country and western - since the Newport Folk Festival- back in the 60's? They were right to boo him then, it turns out.

Now- I myself feel inspired by Dylan- the Dylan of black and white- ""Blowing in the Wind"" lyrics and the great poetry of ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" AND it's phenomenal accompanying (and seminal) video.

We realize that this one hit wonder- at least in terms of Beatles style hits-with - ""Blowin in the Wind"" really meant it when he said ""the answer is blowing in the wind"". He had not one clue- whilst others of us of that generation have gone on to fight the power and do lots of good- he has not contributed like the Beatles and will not be played in elevators. Yes he is a performer and has continued to put out excellently mediocre music- a Nina Simone- he is not!

And I must confess, I have not had the time to study Bob's lyrics since the early days. ""Tangled up in blue"" was a nice phrase. I hope there are others.

His poetry- that might be the high point- and it's fairly incomprehensible. His writings were pretty good in ""Tarantula""- the ""Chronicles"" seems to reflect a burnt out case. On a recent DVD on Bob- ""Bob Dylan- The Narrative Continues""- one of the features is an interview he gave the press in Rome I believe- early 200's - that shows him as his usual unhelpful, arrogant and elusive self. The questions were really poor also. One could have been, ""Why aren't you more political?""

Please- such singers as Judy Collins and Joan Baez- are not evasive. Bob answers one questioner who asked why the band dresses the way they do that ""That's the way we dress where we come from."" Where?- 1850's Pennsylvania Amish country?

I'm sorry- my generation (I'm 70) was known for doing ""in depth"". Please reflect that- this to AARP- not Amazon, please? if only a smidgeon? The AARP establishment birthday wishes from various ""celebs"" reveals them to b as shallow as is Bob.

Out generation stood for something, thank you. The talking heads on this dvd are fabulous- just, in my opinion, they never touch on the negative- mention the word ""genius"" too much, and are way too boosteristic. I know they have careers as music writers to defend- but how about some reality?

I think Bob thinks he is being authentic, to a degree, by being rude and evasive- and that is not necessary. He is ""better than that"". But if he doesn't even realize how great he was in the sixties and what he owes to a Pete Seeger- it's a shame! It's as if he had a chance to be as great as a John Lennon in the 60's- and he blew it!

Pick up the pace, Bobby

and upon further reading i wrote the following:  For me, what with Epstein's knowledge of music and, especially, poetry, this bio of Bob Dylan- The Ballad of Bob Dylan, is probably definitive.

Epstein neatly chronicles BD's life with four concerts as guideposts.

I had accepted the media myths created for BD (Dylan) - that he is the prickly, uncooperative, but an iconic hero of the 60's. That bugged me because I know many other greater heroes of the 60's.

Turns out Bob is hardworking and generous. While he may not been have been forthcoming or political enough for my tastes- it's clear that while BD reflected the 60's, he did not comment upon them, as much as we may have wished some one to do so (see Howard Zinn)!

The dvd documentary on Phil Ochs (""There but for fortune"") shows clearly that Phil spoke more clearly than Bob about the 60's... but were his songs better? no way!! Jonh Lennon and Gil Scott Heron spoke much more clearly about the 60's! In fact- so did Nina Simone!! But Bob joined Phil for the concert in honor of the Chilean singer, Victor Jara, who was killed by Pinochet's thugs. And how much more of a protest song could our generation want than ""Masters of War""?

BD is, after all, a composer, poet and musician. You are sucked in by his harmonies, his cadence changes- and then come the dynamite lyrics: ""Here's to those that came w the dust and are gone w the wind""- simple but unforgettable.

BD has (w integrity) stubbornly refused to be pigeonholed as other than a song and dance man- following in the footsteps of a Johnny Cash. So what if he has not had the edge of certain others- his lyrics clearly support the humanity of a generation trying to change things for the better.. he channels Woodie Guthrie- he channels so many other persons who had something to say!.he is a good artist for our generation- we don't tolerate fools gladly. It's clear enough where his sympathies lie. The fact that BD has obfuscated interviewers often is a credit- they ask such stupid questions, don't they?

You can see that if Bob respects the film maker- as a Scorcese- he tells it like it is!

Hopefully, artists like BD (and film makers like Scorcese) will be even more honest and political in the future!

To me, ""the answer my friends/ is mass movement for social change; the answer is mass movement for social change""- but that has no poetic ring.

When I hear that Bob collects cars or real estate- that reminds me of a Hugh Hefner; I would like Bob to be MORE- but...the fact that he is not? (I also wish other great composers- Mozart and Wagner were more political- guess what?!?!? they're not!)

Noes added later (7/19/11) upon watching the Scorcese documentary on Dylan- ""No Direction Home""- Bob is not evasive talking to Martin- I realize my initial negative reaction (see above letter and refutation by Dan) was juvenile and foolish. The harmonic changes alone draw you into Bob's music- and THEN- then there are the lyrics. For a protestor like myself? ""Masters of War"" is as great a protest song as you could like.

""I hope that you'll die/ and I hope it comes soon/ I'll stand on your grave and make sure that you're dead!""

""Here's to those that come w the dust and are gone w the wind""- was that enough for poetry? or ""How does it feel- to be all alolne- no directgion home, like a rolling stone?""- right up there w the stones ""All of the things that you used to do- if they're done now, well they're done by you!""

A great documentary on Phil Ochs- ""There but for Fortune"" has just been released, and one could be tempted to say, Phil suffered at Bobby's hands. But didn't Bob join Phil at the tribute concert to Victor Jara- Chilean folk singer shot in the back by Pinochet's thugs in Chile?

Liam Clancy tells Bob: ""Remember Bob- no fear, no envy, no meanness.""",1304985600,5,7569,4.514996342355523

all four of these titles follow the career of the greatest songwriter ever, featuring information and highlights for every dylan fan, presented by fellow musicians and music critics...

now...these pieces are brought to you by the same people who bring us 'rock milestones', 'inside', 'under review' and 'critical review', (amongst others), and sadly, they often get blasted, because people are mistakingly believeing them to feature more music than they actual do...

these are not concerts, nor video collections...these are documentaries by people who know, that you may not know...most of the 'journalists' featured are heavy-duty names in the music industry, from newspapers and magazines that are mostly found in europe, and some of the better new york music locations...

these are not 'nobodys', as some reviews suggest...no, they may not be household names in middle-class america, unless you're knowledge of music runs deep, but these guys were, and still are, the ones going thru it all, as it happens...
