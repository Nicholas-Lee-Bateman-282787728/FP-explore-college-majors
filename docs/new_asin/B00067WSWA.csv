8040061,5,B00067WSWA,Recieved this item very quickly. I would encourage anyone wanting to learn the fiddle to buy it. Excited for my grandson to learn,1392768000,,129,4.6521739130434785
8040062,4,B00067WSWA,"Kevin Burke is a master at Irish fiddle, in my book, the best. I only started playing fiddle about 6 months ago, so this was a bit over my head. I did very well with DVD I. He goes a bit faster on DVD II. If you are an intermediate or higher fiddler, then you will probably do very well with it, for me I'm not there yet.",1302480000,,321,3.735294117647059
8040063,5,B00067WSWA,This is the follow up to Kevin Burke's 1st video. It's quite a bit more of a challenge because he teaches at a faster rate and it is sometimes hard to see what he is doing. You will learn the more advanced triple bowing and some great left hand techniques.,1200096000,,256,4.14
