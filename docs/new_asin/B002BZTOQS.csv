3902011,5,B002BZTOQS,"As all of us die-hard Elizabeth Montgomery fans know, this actress can no wrong, whether playing a pretty, suburban witch; a homicidal New England ax murderess; or in this movie, a woman who goes blind and has to learn to adjust to her new life as a sightless person. Always the strong and independent spirit, she struggles on valiantly to prove she is still as strong and confident as ever, but even a superwoman, as her character sees herself, needs some help sometime: hence, the seeing eye dog she learns to love and, more importantly, rely on in ways she never had to worry about when she had her sight.

This might be one of the first movies about what it's really like to have a seeing eye dog, and we go through training with Ms. Montgomery's character, seeing the inner workings of a training school for the blind: This is a familiar trait in EM movies: seeing something for the first time on TV, whether it's violent, loving, heartbreaking or inspiring. EM certainly lives up to her reputation as reigning movie-of-the-week small screen queen for her time.",1426464000,3,1066,4.670212765957447
3902012,5,B002BZTOQS,"Excellent movie! Elizabeth Montgomery was great as usual. The dog, Emma was given to Elizabeth as a gift at the movie wrap party. The dog trainer thought Emma would not be suited as a seeing-eye guide dog. Liz and Emma had spent so much time together preproduction through filming of the movie that they developed a loving relationship.",1360368000,2,336,4.810344827586207
3902013,5,B002BZTOQS,Just a fantastic film. The late Elisabeth Montgomery did a knock out job with this film. Even the dog Emma was a star.,1290384000,6,118,4.173913043478261

8362611,2,B002BZTOQS,"the movie itself is awesome. However I didn't get to see the movie as a different disc was in the DVD cover. The cover itself looks cheesy, home made, which leads me to believe that had I gotten the disc I had ordered, it probably would have been a poor quality COPY! I am still looking for th eoriginal video, as it is a wonderful story.",1483747200,,338,4.136363636363637
8362612,3,B002BZTOQS,"No doubt this is a wonderful movie, but beware of the fact that this is actually sold as a DVD-R, distributed by AFA Entertainment LLC (who no longer shows the item as available through their website), and you may have problems with it.  I was unable to use the Menu, and had to Fast Forward to get the movie to play.  Then, 5-minutes before the end of the movie, the picture freezes and I cannot view the ending.  Unfortunately, I did not watch it until a few months after I made the purchase, so I am no longer able to exchange it or return it.  If you do purchase it, knows these fact and that the picture is grainy and dark at times.",1461024000,2,637,4.154471544715447
8362613,5,B002BZTOQS,"I always loved this movie. Elizabeth Montgomery proves her great acting and convincing as blind woman. Her a the love she builds with her seeing eye dog is wonderful and loving. Want give away the ending, but I did cry.",1458086400,,219,4.5

8362615,5,B002BZTOQS,"Wonderful DVD !!!!!!  I love Elizabeth Montgomery and she is WONDERFUL in this movie !! If you are a fan of hers , this movie is worth the money !! The movie was done in the 80's , I think , and it was a made for tv movie. It shows it's age a little , but if you love these types of movies , this one is a good one to buy !!  :))  I'm so glad I added this to my collection !!  :))",1436400000,3,380,3.383720930232558
8362616,5,B002BZTOQS,"This is not only a feel good story, it is inspirational. We are introduced to a strong, intelligent woman who learns that being independent is good to a point. Once she reached a point where that independence threatened to thrust her into a life of loneliness, she reconsidered, first with a dog and then with a man. This is an enjoyable movie that will warm your heart.",1433894400,,370,4.537313432835821
8362617,5,B002BZTOQS,"When an Elizabeth Montgomery TV movie is offered for purchase on Amazon I normally always buy it.  Very few of her TV movies that she did after her 1960s-1970s TV series Bewitched are available on DVD.  All of them that I have watched are excellent whether Elizabeth is playing the villian such as an ax-murderer in Lizzie Borden or the all-around good person such as a pioneer woman in the TV mini-series The Awakening Land.  Her work in this film, Second Sight: A Love Story is no exception in terms of the quality of her acting of which she plays Alexandra or Alex for short.  Her portrayal of a blind woman is so realistic by the motions in her eyes, her movement of her cane, and how she later on handles her dog named Emma of which she gets not long after a stranger attacks her in her room.  I'm sure she got great training on this as she does an excellent job.

I am not familiar with other DVD releases from AFA Entertainment LLC of which released this film.  I am assuming this is a small independent company just by looking at the coverart on the DVD case.  On the DVD disc a much younger photo of Elizabeth Montgomery is used instead of a film screen from the movie.  To me, viewing this movie is of similar quality as watching a VHS tape.  One part of the movie looks like a commerical was perhaps edited out.  The picture and audio could be a little clearer, however, I am nonetheless more than pleased that I could at least purchase this as it's a great film that I'll definitely re-watch.

I did read in one of my Elizabeth Montgomery books that Elizabeth herself kept the dog that played Emma after filming.  And I assuming, but could be wrong, that they used an actual dog that was trained for blind people.  The scene where the dog stops walking, so therefore Elizabeth's character Alex stops else otherwise would have been hit and possibly killed by a fast-moving vehicle, is very emotional as she goes to kneel down and pet Emma.  Her character has to have absolute trust in this animal to take her thru a walk in the city all the while fellow pedestrians are stunned to see her on her own (and her character dislikes when a stranger offers to help her cross the street).

I will not give away the ending of the movie but it's a tear-jerker, and in a good way.  And there is a romance thrown into the plot as well between Elizabeth's character Alex and a gentleman who meets her at work one day (she works the desk at a museum).",1430265600,4,2449,4.359030837004405

8362619,2,B002BZTOQS,Copy was poor.  Too dark in places and sound quality not so good.  Made for TV movie what can you expect?  Bought it because I am a fan of Elizabeth Montgomery.,1427846400,,160,4.096774193548387
