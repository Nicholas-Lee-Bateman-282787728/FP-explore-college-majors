3036581,3,B000YVBELY,"It's great to finally have all the Banacek episodes avail. on DVD.
I am somewhat disappointed with the DVD quality on these.
The 2nd season box set - picture quality is very grainy with artifacting ( similar to a bad jpeg )and the picture is not too sharp either.
There are some sound problems where you can hear some scratchy noises like playing an old record on certain spots.
The second season has a more accurate color balance than season one, which had a very reddish overcast.
I admit I didn't expect pristine quality when they are cramming 230 - 250 minutes per disc - that's a lot of compression to fit that much time on to each disc. More compression = poorer quality.
The quality isn't much better than an old Vhs tape recorded from cable.
But I would still would rather have this than nothing.
It's too bad the quality is just slightly higher than you would expect from a bootleg copy. I would have gladly paid a little extra if the sets spanned a few more discs and had better quality.
The prints the 2nd season were transferred from aren't the cleanest either.
But hey it's Banacek - and it's great having them on DVD to watch.",1201219200,31,1140,4.433333333333334
3036582,4,B000YVBELY,"Watching Banacek and listening to that wonderful theme music takes me right back to the early 70s. I vividly recall watching these shows when they originally aired and always enjoyed them. Unique, complex mysteries that completely baffled me and had unexpected resolutions; witty dialogue and blissfully un-politically correct. Like that other beloved 70's detective, Columbo, Banacek is seldom without his cigar. He's a womanizer and very smug but undeniably smart and cool. I loved the ""old Polish proverbs"" that he dropped like Zen koans in each episode:

""A truly wise man never plays leapfrog with a Unicorn.""

""Only someone with nothing to be sorry about smiles at the rear of an elephant.""

""If your socks are not in your shoes, don't look for them in Heaven.""

I had the first season of Banacek on pre-order for months last year and it has been a blast from the past watching it. Considering how much I always loved the theme music, I was surprised that I did not recall how they re-worked the theme in each episode in a different fashion (jazzy in one, straight in another, etc.). I'm delighted that they are now releasing the second season (which I've also had on pre-order for a while now) as well as the missing pilot episode. I especially remember the episode from the second season about Max, the computer that goes missing (""If Max Is So Smart, Why Doesn't He Tell Us Where He Is?""). It's been over 30 years since I last saw it but I still remember certain scenes from that episode for some reason.

The first season DVD (a 2-disc set) is bare bones but has decent prints of the episodes and it is just great to be able to watch these again in any fashion. I can't speak about the second season DVD yet (a 3-disc set) as it is a week away from release as of this writing, but it looks as if the second season is being put out by a different company and will include a few extras as well as the excellent pilot episode that was missing from the first DVD. Vintage 70's goodness.",1200441600,9,1992,4.537604456824512
3036583,5,B000YVBELY,"I too am sorry the sets don't have extras. But that's yet another reason we're publishing a book on this Terrific series at BearManor Media in late 2008. I just gave away the 2nd reason - this is a GREAT series. The smartest show with the best scripts of Any detective show. Very much like the old Falcon and Saint movies of the 1930s and 40s, I think.

3036584,5,B000YVBELY,"Over the years there have been a number of entertaining series on TV. But, as one looks back, it is clear that only a very few TV series stood out sharply from the crowd as both unique in concept and very well done. Banacek definitely was one such unique and outstanding series. Thomas Banacek (superbly played by George Peppard) was a free-lance insurance investigator with a charismatic personality and a knack for solving seemingly insoluble large-scale cases of theft and fraud -- for a hefty 10% fee. Every episode was both fascinating and enjoyable and the series never became predictable or boring. With this DVD of the pilot episode and the second season of we will now have available all of the episodes of this outstanding TV series. I bought the first season set as soon as it was available and thoroughly enjoying it -- it was every bit as good as I had remembered it. Although the eight episodes contained on the first season DVD were terrific, the pilot episode was missing. Supposedly this second DVD will include the outstanding pilot episode plus the eight episodes from the second season. I've pre-ordered it and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. Though it only lasted a couple of years, Banacek was one of the best series TV ever offered. If you're not familiar with it, please order it now and find out how good the best of TV once was.",1199145600,13,1355,4.673640167364017
3036585,5,B000YVBELY,"Fans of ""Banacek"" will be excited to learn that the mystery of the missing pilot episode has been solved. According to Arts Alliance America studios, the missing pilot episode ""Detour to Nowhere"" will be included in the second and final season of ""Banacek"" on DVD. Along with the missing pilot, the remaining eight season two episodes will be included for your viewing pleasure. My biggest complaint with the season one set was the lack of extras and the missing pilot episode that started it all.

The distributor of season one Hart Sharp Video was bought by Arts Alliance America and we have them to thank for the upcoming three disc release of ""Banacek"" season two. In my opinion the quality of the first season audio and video was better than I expected and I hope season two will be comparable in quality as well. Season two of ""Banacek"" had quite an array of guest stars such as Cesar Romero, John Saxon, Dick Van Patten, Linda Evans, Victoria Principal and many others. In Season two of ""Banacek"" there's more Capers, Cigars and Commission to be had.

(Bonus Feature)
Pilot Episode: ""Detour To Nowhere""

An (update) on the second and final season of ""Banacek"". It should run approximately 576 minutes and will be presented in its 1.33:1 Full Screen format. The three discs are single sided and overall the DVD packaging and disc artwork are very well done. The video image does suffer from age related issues and the prints from Universal Studios contain some grain and debris. In my opinion the sound does crackle in certain episodes here and there, but I didn't let it ruin my viewing experience. As a long time fan of this show, I'm just happy to finally have all the complete episodes of ""Banacek"" in my DVD collection.

The only Bonus feature included in this set is the original pilot episode ""Detour To Nowhere"" found on disc three. The alleged bonus scripts that were supposed to be included as extras are nowhere to be found. Maybe Arts Alliance America could bring in ""Ellery Queen"" to solve that mystery. I hope this information was helpful to fans of the show.",1196726400,92,2525,4.626398210290827

3036595,5,B000YVBELY,"This is a great detective series from the 1970's. I remember watching the originals on TV as a kid like it was yesterday. It features an insurance investigator named Banacek (pronounced Banacheck). The series may seem a little dated at times, but overall it has held up well. And how about those great Polish proverbs?

Some have criticized the series for having story lines that were just too fantastic. Is there anyone who could really be that smart to plot these, much less figure them out? Well..., but they were a lot of fun.

Many of the guest stars are just too much as well - so unlike their later roles.

I read that there would have been a third season, but old George was getting a divorce and it would mess up his property settlement. Too bad.

3036597,5,B000YVBELY,"I had earlier purchased ""Banacek"" (First & Second Seasons) from another merchant supposedly in the USA. My DVD's arrived from China, utilising some inferior kind of DVD recording material. When the DVD's got warm, they stopped. Nothing known to man could re-start them. Not only that, they were pirated, off air from a TV station somewhere in the USA. And the picture quality was dreadfully poor. In desperation, loving ""Banacek"", and wanting to own great quality DVD's of the show, I ordered with Amazon.com and I am kicking myself I didn't order with them in the first place! The DVD's from Amazon.com are excellent quality, absolutely legal (no pirated copies) and the show content is the best. George Peppard is really in his element in this role, it was made for him. The support acting by Christine Belford, Murray Matheson and Ralph Manza is just brilliant.

3036619,5,B000YVBELY,"George Peppard returns for the second and last season of Banacek.  Like a magician's illusion, each episode opens with the unveiling of some sensational happening that seems to defy logical explanation.  Typically something extremely valuable has disappeared, leaving an insurance company on the hook for a huge loss.  Faced with a case too challenging for their in-house staff to handle, Boston based investigator Thomas Banacek is the man that insurance companies turn to.  Brilliant, affluent, handsome, and refined, Banacek is the best at what he does, and he knows it.  For a ten per-cent recovery fee, he takes on these unusual and perplexing cases, with a low-key style and a quiet confidence that is disarming, and which his competitors find exasperating.

Banacek travels around the country, driven by his chauffeur Jay (Ralph Manza), and strategically aided by his friend, book dealer Felix Mullholland (Murray Matheson).  Some of the technology and methods employed to commit the crimes, may not have held water too well even back then, and may be even less credible today, but like a magic trick, often it is the presentation, executed with style and panache that provides the entertainment.  The outrageously crimes and detective work, make the series well worth watching.

The there are eight episodes in season two.  A nice bonus is `Detour to Nowhere' the series pilot, which completes the series.  A brief summary of the nine episodes in this collection follows.

Detour to Nowhere (Pilot):  An armored car carrying a fortune in gold mysteriously vanishes in the desert, while in transit from Texas to the Oklahoma border.  After sixty days, unresolved insurance matters are open for anyone to claim a ten percent finder's fee.  At that point, Banacek steps into the case, much to the dismay of the insurance investigators currently working on the matter.  After meeting Carlie Kirkland (Christine Belford) for the first time, Banacek heads to Texas, where he hooks up with limousine driver, Jay Drury (Ralph Manza), and begins investigating this most perplexing case.  Clever writing gets the series off to a great start, in an episode that features some nice cinematography.

No Stone Unturned: A large granite artwork disappears after being delivered to a gallery.  With the help of a video journalist (Candy Clark), Banacek takes on the case competing with investigators Kirland and Henry DeWitt (Linden Chiles).  The solution is one of the weaker ones, but still a pretty good episode, that also features Gary Lockwood, and Don Stroud.

If Max is So Smart, Why Doesn't He Tell Us Where He Is?:  `Max' is a large computer specializing in diagnosing medical problems, that mysteriously disappears from a secured building, leaving only debris and wires hanging from the ceiling grid.  Banacek's task is to determine poor Max's fate.  Credibility and romance is a bit thin in this one, but seeing Thomas in a scuba suit, shades and a cigar is hilarious.

The Three Million Dollar Piracy:  Actress Diana Maitland (Arlene Martell) is to be wed to a Middle Eastern shah.  Her wedding gift, a fabulous jeweled coach vanishes while being loaded onboard a ship in Boston harbor, under the direct supervision of engaged investigators DeWitt and Kirkland.  Banacek must solve the mystery quickly as the ship must leave port soon.  A great episode with ample action, intrigue, and beautiful women, that keeps you guessing until the end.

The Vanishing Chalice:  An ancient Greek artifact seemingly disappears while on display at a private showing.  Banacek investigates, with Carlie officially assigned as his aide, in this mystery that features intrigue, murder, and a really inventive solution.  Guest stars include John Saxon, Eric Braden, and Sue Ann Langdon.

Horse of a Slightly Different Color:  While running a trial lap, a champion racehorse mysteriously transforms into another horse.  The colt's overbearing owner wants Banacek on the case.  Lane Bradbury provides a change of pace from the usual Banacek love interest in this equestrian mystery that also features Anne Francis.

Rocket to Oblivion:  A top secret rocket engine disappears from a scientific expo, bringing Banacek to the scene, to reunite with an old friend (Linda Evans) promoting the event.  Carlie is also present, and everyone has to contend with the angry owner of the missing engine (Andrew Prine).

Fly Me If You Can Find Me:  A plane develops engine trouble and is forced to make an emergency landing at an isolated Nevada airfield at night.  The crew retires to a motel, but when they return in the morning, the plane has vanished and a man lies dead.  Reminiscent of the pilot, this is one of the best episodes in the series, as Banacek returns to the desert.  On his way to solving this grand illusion, he romances a gorgeous stewardess (Victoria Principal), and provides enlightenment regarding Dortmunder and Munchner beers.

No You See Me, Now You Don't:  In Los Angeles, banker Bradley Merrick (Jay Robinson) vanishes for real on stage, while performing a magic trick with his daughter (Gretchen Corbett), just as the police are about to arrest him for theft.  Banacek is soon on the case, in the middle of a heated family drama that eventually takes him to Las Vegas, only a few steps behind a killer.  The series finale is a gritty mystery that finds Banacek winding things up in magician's garb, though the solution is marred by an implausible impersonation.

And so we bid farewell to Banacek, it was a great ride while it lasted.  These are very entertaining mysteries, that can be watched over and over again.  George Peppard was ideal in the role.  The character seems toned down a bit in season two, becoming a less abrasive and curbing his amorous urges as well.  While not greeted with open arms, his presence is not met with the same level of animosity as in the first season.  The series was slated for a third season, when Peppard quit the show because he was divorcing actress Elizabeth Ashley, and didn't want to add to his net worth.  So a failed real-life marriage, was apparently responsible for the great Banacek's demise",1203292800,7,6141,5.031714568880079

The mysteries are a mixed lot.  Some are hard to figure [the magican one was kind of neat], while some were too simple[the missing airplane[.  However that isn't the point, the point is the ""cool"" factor.  I remember wearing those turtle neck shirts, smoking those pencil thin cigars, and never getting the girl, oh well.

3036626,5,B000YVBELY,"The series has now come full circle. The pilot episode, ""Detour To Nowhere"" is included as a ""Bonus"" feature on the 3rd of a set of 3 decorative TV guide style discs in a nicely arranged product that brings us the final season of an exceptional program. The crowning light of the Wednesday Mystery Movie of the Week. Banacek is a true visit to the past as it was. A calmer, well civilized and interesting world of antiques, friends, short love affairs and puzzling cases that bring to life the 1970's in a special way.
The second season featured less eccentric insurance claimants and more participation by Insurance agent regulars with the Boston company that pays Banacek his 10% finders fee. Also, Banacek's friend and information supplier, Mr. Mulholland who has the best job in the world as an Antiquarian Book Dealer is seen several times with the same Asian lady studying various Chess positions and 70s style ""communication"" techniques that bring lighter moments to the plot.
As always, women are attracted to Banacek's cool style but as a field player he rarely is serious with anyone save for a few repeat romantic engagements with his fellow investigator for the Boston insurance firm, Karly, a repeat character drawn from the original pilot as was his valet and our bookseller Mulholland.
All of the plots are interesting, colorful, slow paced but never lapsing, well written and worth the price!  Well recommended.",1201219200,20,1427,4.945833333333334
3271078,3,B000YVBELY,"It's great to finally have all the Banacek episodes avail. on DVD.
I am somewhat disappointed with the DVD quality on these.
The 2nd season box set - picture quality is very grainy with artifacting ( similar to a bad jpeg )and the picture is not too sharp either.
There are some sound problems where you can hear some scratchy noises like playing an old record on certain spots.
The second season has a more accurate color balance than season one, which had a very reddish overcast.
I admit I didn't expect pristine quality when they are cramming 230 - 250 minutes per disc - that's a lot of compression to fit that much time on to each disc. More compression = poorer quality.
The quality isn't much better than an old Vhs tape recorded from cable.
But I would still would rather have this than nothing.
It's too bad the quality is just slightly higher than you would expect from a bootleg copy. I would have gladly paid a little extra if the sets spanned a few more discs and had better quality.
The prints the 2nd season were transferred from aren't the cleanest either.
But hey it's Banacek - and it's great having them on DVD to watch.",1201219200,31,1140,4.433333333333334
3271079,4,B000YVBELY,"Watching Banacek and listening to that wonderful theme music takes me right back to the early 70s. I vividly recall watching these shows when they originally aired and always enjoyed them. Unique, complex mysteries that completely baffled me and had unexpected resolutions; witty dialogue and blissfully un-politically correct. Like that other beloved 70's detective, Columbo, Banacek is seldom without his cigar. He's a womanizer and very smug but undeniably smart and cool. I loved the ""old Polish proverbs"" that he dropped like Zen koans in each episode:

""A truly wise man never plays leapfrog with a Unicorn.""

""Only someone with nothing to be sorry about smiles at the rear of an elephant.""

""If your socks are not in your shoes, don't look for them in Heaven.""

I had the first season of Banacek on pre-order for months last year and it has been a blast from the past watching it. Considering how much I always loved the theme music, I was surprised that I did not recall how they re-worked the theme in each episode in a different fashion (jazzy in one, straight in another, etc.). I'm delighted that they are now releasing the second season (which I've also had on pre-order for a while now) as well as the missing pilot episode. I especially remember the episode from the second season about Max, the computer that goes missing (""If Max Is So Smart, Why Doesn't He Tell Us Where He Is?""). It's been over 30 years since I last saw it but I still remember certain scenes from that episode for some reason.

The first season DVD (a 2-disc set) is bare bones but has decent prints of the episodes and it is just great to be able to watch these again in any fashion. I can't speak about the second season DVD yet (a 3-disc set) as it is a week away from release as of this writing, but it looks as if the second season is being put out by a different company and will include a few extras as well as the excellent pilot episode that was missing from the first DVD.

3271081,5,B000YVBELY,"Over the years there have been a number of entertaining series on TV. But, as one looks back, it is clear that only a very few TV series stood out sharply from the crowd as both unique in concept and very well done. Banacek definitely was one such unique and outstanding series. Thomas Banacek (superbly played by George Peppard) was a free-lance insurance investigator with a charismatic personality and a knack for solving seemingly insoluble large-scale cases of theft and fraud -- for a hefty 10% fee. Every episode was both fascinating and enjoyable and the series never became predictable or boring. With this DVD of the pilot episode and the second season of we will now have available all of the episodes of this outstanding TV series. I bought the first season set as soon as it was available and thoroughly enjoying it -- it was every bit as good as I had remembered it. Although the eight episodes contained on the first season DVD were terrific, the pilot episode was missing. Supposedly this second DVD will include the outstanding pilot episode plus the eight episodes from the second season. I've pre-ordered it and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. Though it only lasted a couple of years, Banacek was one of the best series TV ever offered. If you're not familiar with it, please order it now and find out how good the best of TV once was.",1199145600,13,1355,4.673640167364017
3271082,5,B000YVBELY,"Fans of ""Banacek"" will be excited to learn that the mystery of the missing pilot episode has been solved. According to Arts Alliance America studios, the missing pilot episode ""Detour to Nowhere"" will be included in the second and final season of ""Banacek"" on DVD. Along with the missing pilot, the remaining eight season two episodes will be included for your viewing pleasure. My biggest complaint with the season one set was the lack of extras and the missing pilot episode that started it all.

The distributor of season one Hart Sharp Video was bought by Arts Alliance America and we have them to thank for the upcoming three disc release of ""Banacek"" season two. In my opinion the quality of the first season audio and video was better than I expected and I hope season two will be comparable in quality as well. Season two of ""Banacek"" had quite an array of guest stars such as Cesar Romero, John Saxon, Dick Van Patten, Linda Evans, Victoria Principal and many others. In Season two of ""Banacek"" there's more Capers, Cigars and Commission to be had.

(Bonus Feature)
Pilot Episode: ""Detour To Nowhere""

An (update) on the second and final season of ""Banacek"". It should run approximately 576 minutes and will be presented in its 1.33:1 Full Screen format. The three discs are single sided and overall the DVD packaging and disc artwork are very well done. The video image does suffer from age related issues and the prints from Universal Studios contain some grain and debris. In my opinion the sound does crackle in certain episodes here and there, but I didn't let it ruin my viewing experience. As a long time fan of this show, I'm just happy to finally have all the complete episodes of ""Banacek"" in my DVD collection.

The only Bonus feature included in this set is the original pilot episode ""Detour To Nowhere"" found on disc three. The alleged bonus scripts that were supposed to be included as extras are nowhere to be found. Maybe Arts Alliance America could bring in ""Ellery Queen"" to solve that mystery.

It features an insurance investigator named Banacek (pronounced Banacheck). The series may seem a little dated at times, but overall it has held up well. And how about those great Polish proverbs?

Some have criticized the series for having story lines that were just too fantastic. Is there anyone who could really be that smart to plot these, much less figure them out? Well..., but they were a lot of fun.

Many of the guest stars are just too much as well - so unlike their later roles.

Not only that, they were pirated, off air from a TV station somewhere in the USA. And the picture quality was dreadfully poor.

The DVD's from Amazon.com are excellent quality, absolutely legal (no pirated copies) and the show content is the best. George Peppard is really in his element in this role, it was made for him.

3271116,5,B000YVBELY,"George Peppard returns for the second and last season of Banacek.  Like a magician's illusion, each episode opens with the unveiling of some sensational happening that seems to defy logical explanation.  Typically something extremely valuable has disappeared, leaving an insurance company on the hook for a huge loss.  Faced with a case too challenging for their in-house staff to handle, Boston based investigator Thomas Banacek is the man that insurance companies turn to.  Brilliant, affluent, handsome, and refined, Banacek is the best at what he does, and he knows it.  For a ten per-cent recovery fee, he takes on these unusual and perplexing cases, with a low-key style and a quiet confidence that is disarming, and which his competitors find exasperating.

Banacek travels around the country, driven by his chauffeur Jay (Ralph Manza), and strategically aided by his friend, book dealer Felix Mullholland (Murray Matheson).  Some of the technology and methods employed to commit the crimes, may not have held water too well even back then, and may be even less credible today, but like a magic trick, often it is the presentation, executed with style and panache that provides the entertainment.  The outrageously crimes and detective work, make the series well worth watching.

The there are eight episodes in season two.  A nice bonus is `Detour to Nowhere' the series pilot, which completes the series.  A brief summary of the nine episodes in this collection follows.

Detour to Nowhere (Pilot):  An armored car carrying a fortune in gold mysteriously vanishes in the desert, while in transit from Texas to the Oklahoma border.  After sixty days, unresolved insurance matters are open for anyone to claim a ten percent finder's fee.  At that point, Banacek steps into the case, much to the dismay of the insurance investigators currently working on the matter.  After meeting Carlie Kirkland (Christine Belford) for the first time, Banacek heads to Texas, where he hooks up with limousine driver, Jay Drury (Ralph Manza), and begins investigating this most perplexing case.  Clever writing gets the series off to a great start, in an episode that features some nice cinematography.

No Stone Unturned: A large granite artwork disappears after being delivered to a gallery.  With the help of a video journalist (Candy Clark), Banacek takes on the case competing with investigators Kirland and Henry DeWitt (Linden Chiles).  The solution is one of the weaker ones, but still a pretty good episode, that also features Gary Lockwood, and Don Stroud.

If Max is So Smart, Why Doesn't He Tell Us Where He Is?:  `Max' is a large computer specializing in diagnosing medical problems, that mysteriously disappears from a secured building, leaving only debris and wires hanging from the ceiling grid.  Banacek's task is to determine poor Max's fate.  Credibility and romance is a bit thin in this one, but seeing Thomas in a scuba suit, shades and a cigar is hilarious.

The Three Million Dollar Piracy:  Actress Diana Maitland (Arlene Martell) is to be wed to a Middle Eastern shah.  Her wedding gift, a fabulous jeweled coach vanishes while being loaded onboard a ship in Boston harbor, under the direct supervision of engaged investigators DeWitt and Kirkland.  Banacek must solve the mystery quickly as the ship must leave port soon.  A great episode with ample action, intrigue, and beautiful women, that keeps you guessing until the end.

The Vanishing Chalice:  An ancient Greek artifact seemingly disappears while on display at a private showing.  Banacek investigates, with Carlie officially assigned as his aide, in this mystery that features intrigue, murder, and a really inventive solution.  Guest stars include John Saxon, Eric Braden, and Sue Ann Langdon.

Horse of a Slightly Different Color:  While running a trial lap, a champion racehorse mysteriously transforms into another horse.  The colt's overbearing owner wants Banacek on the case.  Lane Bradbury provides a change of pace from the usual Banacek love interest in this equestrian mystery that also features Anne Francis.

Rocket to Oblivion:  A top secret rocket engine disappears from a scientific expo, bringing Banacek to the scene, to reunite with an old friend (Linda Evans) promoting the event.  Carlie is also present, and everyone has to contend with the angry owner of the missing engine (Andrew Prine).

Fly Me If You Can Find Me:  A plane develops engine trouble and is forced to make an emergency landing at an isolated Nevada airfield at night.  The crew retires to a motel, but when they return in the morning, the plane has vanished and a man lies dead.  Reminiscent of the pilot, this is one of the best episodes in the series, as Banacek returns to the desert.  On his way to solving this grand illusion, he romances a gorgeous stewardess (Victoria Principal), and provides enlightenment regarding Dortmunder and Munchner beers.

No You See Me, Now You Don't:  In Los Angeles, banker Bradley Merrick (Jay Robinson) vanishes for real on stage, while performing a magic trick with his daughter (Gretchen Corbett), just as the police are about to arrest him for theft.  Banacek is soon on the case, in the middle of a heated family drama that eventually takes him to Las Vegas, only a few steps behind a killer.  The series finale is a gritty mystery that finds Banacek winding things up in magician's garb, though the solution is marred by an implausible impersonation.

And so we bid farewell to Banacek, it was a great ride while it lasted.  These are very entertaining mysteries, that can be watched over and over again.  George Peppard was ideal in the role.  The character seems toned down a bit in season two, becoming a less abrasive and curbing his amorous urges as well.  While not greeted with open arms, his presence is not met with the same level of animosity as in the first season.  The series was slated for a third season, when Peppard quit the show because he was divorcing actress Elizabeth Ashley, and didn't want to add to his net worth.  So a failed real-life marriage, was apparently responsible for the great Banacek's demise",1203292800,7,6141,5.031714568880079

I played who was in what tv series with guest cast and I was struck  by how many of these people are now dead. Banacek is dated by the clothes and cars that are seen in the shows.  The mysteries are a mixed lot.  Some are hard to figure [the magican one was kind of neat], while some were too simple[the missing airplane[.  However that isn't the point, the point is the ""cool"" factor.  I remember wearing those turtle neck shirts, smoking those pencil thin cigars, and never getting the girl, oh well.  I think that this series might do with a revisit  and upadeting.  Anyway bye bye to a ""cool"" time in tv.",1203206400,4,777,4.2827586206896555
3271119,5,B000YVBELY,Great to finally have this out.  The picture quality is better than the first season and I'm glad they included the pilot.,1203206400,2,122,4.545454545454546
3271120,5,B000YVBELY,"George Peppard is excellent as Banacek, and we really enjoyed watching all of these episodes again. The only issue is that the Rocket to Oblivion episode cuts off on the DVD so you don't know who did it or how it ends. It is so fun to watch the 70s styles, stars, etc. in this smart show. This was worth the money!",1202601600,,314,4.080645161290323
3271121,2,B000YVBELY,"I can't believe that no one else has complained about the second disc in the Season 2 series.  I am on my second copy and they both will not play the episode, Rocket to Oblivion,  all the way thru.  It will get to a certain point and then skip back to the same part.  I have been unable to watch the middle and ending.  I have tried it on both my DVD players.  Same result. You can't access the missing parts by chapter either.
The rest of the remaining discs are fine. As well as all the other episodes. I must say the Amazon return policy is great. I had a replacement the same day I shipped the first copy out.  I don't blame Amazon.  I blame the company, which never answers the phone.  They have to know they have a problem.",1202601600,9,729,4.077464788732394
3271122,5,B000YVBELY,"I watched many episodes of this series as a young man in the early 1970's and loved the show. Turns out I had missed about 1 of every 3 episodes back then, without even knowing it. Re-watching this entire series including the pilot (which is on this DVD) was a joy and brought back great memories.",1202428800,2,297,4.321428571428571
3271123,5,B000YVBELY,"The series has now come full circle. The pilot episode, ""Detour To Nowhere"" is included as a ""Bonus"" feature on the 3rd of a set of 3 decorative TV guide style discs in a nicely arranged product that brings us the final season of an exceptional program. The crowning light of the Wednesday Mystery Movie of the Week. Banacek is a true visit to the past as it was. A calmer, well civilized and interesting world of antiques, friends, short love affairs and puzzling cases that bring to life the 1970's in a special way.
The second season featured less eccentric insurance claimants and more participation by Insurance agent regulars with the Boston company that pays Banacek his 10% finders fee. Also, Banacek's friend and information supplier, Mr. Mulholland who has the best job in the world as an Antiquarian Book Dealer is seen several times with the same Asian lady studying various Chess positions and 70s style ""communication"" techniques that bring lighter moments to the plot.
As always, women are attracted to Banacek's cool style but as a field player he rarely is serious with anyone save for a few repeat romantic engagements with his fellow investigator for the Boston insurance firm, Karly, a repeat character drawn from the original pilot as was his valet and our bookseller Mulholland.
All of the plots are interesting, colorful, slow paced but never lapsing, well written and worth the price!  Well recommended.",1201219200,20,1427,4.945833333333334
