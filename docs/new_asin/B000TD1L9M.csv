8539121,5,B000TD1L9M,"Jessie Gruman, Ph. D., has written an essential reference for just about everyone.  She offers a well-informed cushion and roadmap to support what most of us will face quite unprepared--the shock of learning that you or someone you love has a bad diagnosis.  Gruman has been there--she's had 4 serious illnesses, including 3 different cancers.  She has brought her own personal experience and her extensive professional knowledge together in a very accessible reference.  Notice how engaged Charlie Rose becomes from the get-go in his interview with her, due to his own health issues.  Don't wait until you get the bad news, and you are in shock.
