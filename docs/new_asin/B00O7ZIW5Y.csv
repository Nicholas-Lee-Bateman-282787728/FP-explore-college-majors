I want to buy it now to have in my archives as a a permanent reference.  Wonderful insights about fear and relationships, and coming from love instead of fear when in confrontation.  It was exciting to watch the concepts in the book come alive. Only one complaint, the music seemed to overpower the voices sometimes especially ones with accents so I had to rewind to try to understand what they said.

6728737,4,B00O7ZIW5Y,"When we speak of something having heart or of the need to follow our heart, what exactly does that mean? For many of us, such expressions seem warm and inviting but are, nevertheless, understandably vague. However, a recently released DVD helps to eliminate much of the confusion surrounding this often-nebulous topic, offering clear, concise answers applicable in both practical and philosophical contexts. In The Power of the Heart (2014), director Drew Heriot (co-creator of the immensely popular video The Secret (2006)) presents a series of engaging monologues on the subject, discussing it from metaphysical, spiritual and even scientific perspectives. These insights are intercut with a series of fictional vignettes and re-creations of true stories that illustrate these principles at work in a wide range of applications, covering such diverse concepts as the role the heart plays in intuition, synchronicities, forgiveness, friendship and love. These notions are addressed by a host of new thought leaders, including Maya Angelou, Deepak Chopra, Neale Donald Walsch, Eckhart Tolle, Paulo Coelho, Marci Shimoff, Gary Zukav, Marianne Williamson, Mark Nepo, Isabel Allende, Michael Beckwith, John Gray and Jane Goodall. The productions overall style is reminiscent of the filmmakers previous work, stylishly produced and beautifully presented. And, despite a tendency for some of the story sequences to go on a little long, the film makes for worthwhile viewing, particularly for anyone who earnestly wants to learn how to harness the power of this remarkable biological and spiritual tool, one thats with us at all times and can be put to use in countless miraculous ways.

This is a very, very powerful and moving film for anyone who is interested in finding peace, purpose, forgiveness (giving or receiving). It is a film that will appeal to secularists and religious people because it centers on truth and science related to the spiritual aspects of the heart.

And even more if we discover that our hearts and  our brain are more than an organ of the human body and that  actually really play a role in creating realities

With this film I understood how powerful is our heart and why the most ancient cultures gave it so much importance.
I ask to myself  how much we can do as humans not only for our own benefit but for the benefit of humanity if we learn to ""think"" with the heart and to""feel"" with the mind.  Probably we could have a glimpse that we are a divine creation",1433289600,12,674,4.178294573643411

6728748,5,B00O7ZIW5Y,"I was looking forward to this movie, my Unity church was offering a dinner and movie night today. I had to work so I watched it just now on my own. It was a great movie but definitively Immacula's story of her experience hiding in a bathroom with 7 women for 3 months to escape the Tutsi genocide in Rawanda was too intense and powerful for the rest of the movie, it made the rest of the movie and authors whom I love dearly, appear so woo woo when placed next to the suffering Immacula experienced. But you know, if her story was not included in these woo woo movies that appeal
to me, I would not have taken the time to learn more in depth about the incredible strength and forgiveness that a human being is capable of. I guess I see that we are all equal in the eyes of god and the universe, so if our suffering brings us closer to god, that is enough. Just as one human is not better than another, one mans suffering does not make another mans suffering meaningless.  My mind is definitely blown right now.... I've never written more than a cursory perfunctory  amazon review... So you might understand how impactful the experience of hearing this story was to share these thoughts now.
