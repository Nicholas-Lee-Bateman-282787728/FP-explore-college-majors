8018446,3,B0001YYNRG,"Think of this as a low budget ""Close Encounters"" without aliens. Larry (Patrick Killian) has a successful career as a pizza delivery boy. He is fascinate by alien encounters and is part of a UFO group that believe something is going to happen with the millennium only a week away. At the UFO group meeting, introverted Larry meets the highly extroverted Pam (Elyse Ashton), the babe in the group, who goes home with him.

Sure she is crazy, but she is good looking, brings her own coke, and likes making love while Larry wears a space alien gray mask. Having met what would be the love of my life, Larry tosses it all away as he is drawn to the black mail box by Area 51. He must make a pilgrimage to be there at the millennium.

Larry doesn't have many lines. His life is a sad comedy. The film holds your interest in a quirky sort of way. What is curious are the names that appear on the front of DVD cover, ""Shaun Johnston, Kim Hogan, and David Everhart"" as their names are not associated with any of the credits of this film at IMDB. Could someone toss me a bone on that one?
