1206212,2,B00000F924,"Cowboy and the Senorita, 1944 film

The story begins with music and singing at a restaurant. An angry customer complains, two workers are fired and ride away. The sheriff and posse are looking for a lost girl. Roy and Teddy Bear are suspected of kidnapping this lost girl. The escape in a comic routine. Men ride after them. Chip shows up for a meal, and explains why she ran away. She wants to keep her father's old gold mine. Roy and Teddy Bear get a new job working for Isabella. Chip and Ray talk about the box said to be in that old mine. Why does Craig Allen want to buy a worthless gold mine? There is a song. They explore the mine, Chip finds a letter in the hidden box. ""Just a bracelet?"" Roy and Teddy Bear take a short cut to town, but have to run away when an alarm goes off.

The posse catches them, but they explain their suspicions about Allen. The posse goes along to inspect Chip's mine, and finds a hidden tunnel with valuable ore. Can Roy and the men bring the valuable ore into town to prevent the sale? The posse pursues them. There is a chase for action. ""They went that-away."" The assay office says its ""$800 a ton ore"". Chip's fortune is saved. Is this fraud or misrepresentation? Ferguson confesses about the frame-up. The sheriff will take charge of the two men. There is a celebration with dancers, then a song about ""enchiladas"". Another dance and song for the usual happy ending.

This is certainly different from most other Roy Rogers' movies. Its like a dude ranch compared to a working ranch. There is a prominent man in town who turns out to be crooked, there are false charges against the heroes who have to redeem themselves. While below average, but still viewable. Note how Craig's contract says they will share the ""profits"". Craig knew his production company could raise costs to siphon off the profits. And it would be perfectly legal.",1292976000,,1875,4.492668621700879

1206214,3,B00000F924,After watching the not so good Apache Rose I was confused about Roy Rogers' following. This movie has made it clear to me. This was Dale Evans first time with Roy in a film. But she's more of a supporting character. The main female star in this movie is Mary Lee which was all right with me. Mary was a spunky teenager with a beautiful voice. She looks so pretty here and steals the show. The plot Roy Rogers and his friend help Mary find some gold that her dead uncle hid. For a while Dale is even a villian!,1076803200,,509,4.1

7907520,4,B00000F924,"Another great RR ""mini-movie."" Production values are good, considering when and what it is ('C' movie.') The story was typical for RR and the entire thing seems to have been filmed in San Bernadino County, east of Los Angeles, as do his other films. I'd bet it took less than 2 weeks to shoot the entire movie, as they use lots of 'B' roll for the scenery and horses galloping down roads. Just typical RR.

Dale Evans get's second billing in this show; which makes sense, because she and Roger's didn't get married until 1946 and this movie was made in 1944. Still, it was disappointing to see her take second.

Originally ""Trigger"" was a studio horse named ""Golden Cloud."" (Olivia DeHaviland rode Trigger in the 1932 version of ""Robin Hood,"" but he is only seen in one scenethe one filmed next to Chico Creek, in Lower Bidwell Park, Chico, CA, where most of the outdoor photography was done.) Roger's bought him from the studio in 1943. In the movies made after 1943, ""Trigger's"" tack was plain leather, about what the other studio horses used. Gradually, silver tack was acquired to adorn him. (In the end, some of his saddles weighed up to 150lbs, that's a lot of burden on the horse.) It is noticeable in this movie, ""Trigger's"" tack is plain leather and he looks much worse for it.

All-in-all, another great Roy Roger's movie!",1444003200,,1332,4.635593220338983

7907524,5,B00000F924,"This is a simple, yet charming Western featuring the famous cowboy couple, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.  Roy Rogers sings especially beautifully in this film.  And his hefty sidekick, teddy bear, is a likeable sort, too.  The plot is predictable from the outset, yet it is well executed by all the actors in the film, so it makes for a fun, clean, evening at home to watch this movie.  One of the highlights of the motion picture is the spunkiness of the young girl, Chip.  As the underage heiress to a mine that her father claims to have hid a treasure in, she runs away in an attempt to find it before her older half-sister sells it to the big man in town who already owns everything.  Roy Rogers and his sidekick in the process get accused of having kidnapped the young girl so they end up helping Chip in an aim to set the record straight.  For light-hearted and clean fun, this movie is just the perfect fare.",1411516800,,912,4.3609467455621305
