8657564,4,B00KCAB7P0,"Not nearly as bad as I was led to believe.  To see a 10+ film w/ Gable & Loy (and Tracy) see ""Test Pilot"" - one of Loy's favorite films, or to see Loy at her dramatic/slutty best ""The Rains Came"" which I'd give a 10.",1463529600,,216,3.6956521739130435
8657565,2,B00KCAB7P0,"5 star on chemistry between Gable and Loy.  BUT, I have to agree that this Clark Gable's worst film.  He is better as a rogue, dark knight, gambler, hard nose, seducer, liar, harded by life and the world, and strong manly type.  I think that he mastered Gone With the Wind because he showed the hints of a softer side and a passionate man...but he also showed a hard calloused man as well.  I love Gable.  Always have.  He was unique and different than any other male actor in Hollywood.  Hollywood men have to create an image, an persona.  Gable was Gable.  Steward was Stewart.  Powers was Powers.  I got this movie because I liked the intent look in Gable's eyes when he first sees Loy.  He was a gentleman in this role but too much mushy lines from the studios made him look bad in this movie.  If you love Gable, love this film.  It is based on a true story of the man Parnell.  Read Parnell's life story after watching this movie.  A true real life romance took place between Parnell and his ladylove.",1451433600,,1007,4.333333333333333
8657566,2,B00KCAB7P0,I love Clark Gable and I have collected all his films so far. I think he truly has done some great characters but this movie left me wanting it to be over and done with. I was bored and struggling to find this story interesting.,1447804800,,228,4.088888888888889
8657567,5,B00KCAB7P0,"""Parnell"" is the story of Charles Stewart Parnell and his heroic attempt to win Home Rule for Ireland in the late 1880s. Ireland, at the time, was firmly under the thumb of the British government in London. ""Home Rule"" would have granted the Irish their own Parliament and at least some measure of self- determination.

The title role is played beautifully by Clark Gable. C.G is totally credible as an upper crust Member of British Parliament, representing the City of Cork. There has to be a woman here and that role is played to perfection and beyond by Myra Loy. What a nice couple they made! The ""complicating factor"" -there had to be one-is that Loy, as Gable's girlfriend, is married to another man! That her marriage is one in name only does not help matters. That her husband and G.G. are not exactly close politically further complicates the proceedings. Gable and Loy are startlingly indiscreet making no effort to hide their affair. This reviewer does not know how they conducted themselves in real life. One has to know that matters must end badly, both for themselves and the cause of Irish nationalism. Viewers with any prior knowledge of Irish history will appreciate. Irish history is brimming with gloomy endings. This reviewer is certain that most viewers of ""Parnell"" will come armed with that knowledge or at least a strong curiosity concerning that intense era.

""Parnell"" features a solid cadre of those wonderful old British character actors who were in so many films, often passing almost anonymously. Here we have Donald Crisp, Edna May Oliver, Edmund Gwenn and Montague Love. Whatever became of those folks? What class they brought to the screen!

This Irish American has a decent knowledge of his homeland's troubled history and is ready to bestow 5 stars on any film dealing with Irish nationalism. The only caveat this reviewer can issue here is that those with no prior familiarity with Irish history may not appreciate ""Parnell"".  Those curious about Irish history should jump at the chance to view this underexposed film.",1435881600,2,2054,4.944927536231884
8657568,1,B00KCAB7P0,"MGM's ill-conceived historical drama was a critical and commercial disaster. ""Parnell"" (1937) represented career low points for Clark Gable and Myrna Loy  both hopelessly miscast. Decked out in ridiculous mutton-chop sideburns, Gable avoided further embarrassment by refusing to play the title role with an Irish accent. A solid supporting cast and Karl Freund's cinematography emerge unscathed.",1431561600,,395,6.053571428571429

8657570,4,B00KCAB7P0,I like the movie alot and makes me wonder sometimes when people give this movie a bad review...if they are saying its bad just because the critics said it was a bad movie? or do they really think so themselves that it is a bad movie? or just want someone to make up their minds for them?....albeit it is not the best movie out there...I think Gables best movie was Gone With The Wind and some of the movies that he did with Norma Shearer...like A Free Soul and or with Jean Harlow in Hold Your Man where he put out some movies that really sizzled on the screen especially like A Free Soul....now talk abour a good performance,1404172800,2,625,4.260504201680672
8657571,3,B00KCAB7P0,"Most of the historical parts are glossed over.  Story concentrates on the affair between Parnell and Katie.  Michael Davitt, who actually had the greater part in history is a minor character in this version.  It's Hollywood's version of History.",1403913600,,245,5.230769230769231
