8213237,5,B000OPYWSW,"A wonderful and  VERY IMPORTANT documentary.

There aren't many written about the Battle of Manila in 1945. And most written accounts are abound with political agenda rather than something that retraces the battle and the suffering. This documentary, although by production looks ""amateurish"" has a lot to offer. The documentary succeeds in providing facts direct from reports and survivors as well as well rounded and objective historians like Dr. Ricardo Trota Jose, rather than being based on previous books like many books about the Battle of Manila(most notable, Frank Reel) have been.

This documentary deserves wider audience in order to combat present revisionists that make Japan the victim instead of the aggressor.",1365984000,,725,5.455357142857143
8213238,5,B000OPYWSW,"Manila 1945: The Forgotten Atrocities is a humbling and superior work of archival research, academic commentary, and oral history about a country, a time, and a battle that too many people have never remembered, much less forgotten. At the age of seven years, my father lost his two older brothers to cholera in a barrio that did have enough clean water for all the people trying to get out of harm's way. That was in Cavite. This documentary focuses on the desperate Japanese defense of Manila three years later. As the title suggests, imperial troops did a lot more than conduct military operations against the attacking American army. Let us just say that many men, women, and children in Manila, especially today's tourist traps of Ermita and Malate, suffered and perished from a spree of violence that had no military objective. Luckily, Manila 1945 has recorded the first-hand accounts of many who were there, including Filipino National Artist Francisco Sionil Jose. Their testimony will burn their war memories into yours, so be prepared.",1200614400,3,1046,5.0520231213872835
