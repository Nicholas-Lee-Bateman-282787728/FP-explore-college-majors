541233,5,6303031382,"I first saw Wajda's classic film while visiting Poland decades ago. Intended for an informed Polish audience, it doesn't provide much historical context. For this reason, I include an introduction for the benefit of the non-Polish viewer.

As the Red Army was about the drive the Germans out of Poland, the Polish Underground (AK) came out in open warfare against the Germans (Operation Burza, or Tempest). The AK seized several cities from the Germans in eastern Poland prior to the arrival of Soviet troops.

But Poland had already been betrayed by Churchill and Roosevelt in the events leading up to and including Teheran. The Soviets had no interest in respecting Polish sovereignty and feared no consequences for violating the same. No sooner had the eastern Polish cities been freed than the AK was disarmed and its leaders either shot by the NKVD or shipped to Siberian concentration camps.

Then came Warsaw's turn--only much worse. The Red Army was on the eastern outskirts of Warsaw. The Uprising was launched, intended for a three-day fight. It turned into a 63-day agony. The Red Army stood fast...and stood...and stood. It wouldn't move again for six months. The Soviets wanted the Germans to complete the dirty work of destroying the flower of Polish resistance.

The use of sewers for transport of goods and people had been pioneered and developed some 16 months earlier during the Polish Underground's assistance to the Jewish Ghetto Uprising. During the Polish uprising, as sections of Warsaw fell to the vastly more powerful German forces, the only way out was through the sewers. Wajda's dramatic film captures the drama of the evacuation of Polish fighters and civilians through the sewers of Warsaw. The evacuees not only had to contend with sewage and sewer gasses, but also German booby traps. One scene shows the disarming of a trap consisting of a wired network of German ""potato masher"" grenades.

The taking of POWs by Germans needs clarification. At first, during the Uprising, captured soldiers and civilians were summarily killed. Tens of thousands of unarmed Polish civilians were systematically murdered by the Germans at Wola alone. But then the Germans promised to spare civilians and to afford POW status to the captured combatants. This was no sudden discovery of humanitarianism towards the Slavic untermenschen. The Germans realized that the Poles would never surrender as long as their deaths were inevitable in any case. Also the Germans, realizing that they would likely lose the war, wanted to set a precedent of captured guerillas being afforded POW status in the event of future German guerilla warfare. Finally, there was the specter of postwar war-crimes trials, and the belated need for good German behavior.

Nevertheless, the foregoing considerations didn't stop the Germans from burning and blowing up Warsaw's historic buildings after the Uprising. The Red Army waited outside Warsaw for another three months after the surrender of the Uprising to give the Germans ample time to do this. Scarcely any habitable buildings in Warsaw remained.",1186617600,9,3091,5.18436873747495
541234,5,6303031382,"I think Andrzej Wajda is overrated (personally, I think Kazimierz Kutz is the best among contemporary Polish directors), but for my money this is the best war film ever made. Perhaps the reason is that the camera work was done by Kutz (spelled ""Kuc"" in the credits), as (at least according to the story I've heard) Wajda was too delicate to actually go down in the sewers (yes, the excrement spattered on the faces of the actors is real; those are real sewers). The despair portrayed as each of these young people moves toward his or her inevitable death is relentless (though the film almost never depicts the actual moment of death), and the fact that we are told in the very first moments of the film what fate awaits them certainly does not spoil the effect. In an era when propagandistic cliches about the Germans were practically de rigueur in Polish cinema, the artistry of the film is demonstrated in one of the final scenes, when a young man emerges from the sewer and is disarmed by a German soldier; the soldier does not scream or behave like a brute, but instead behaves in as calm and civilized a manner as if he were simply taking a prisoner of war in accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention. (In fact, according to what I've read about what happened after the Warsaw Uprising was finally crushed, when the Polish soldiers were disarmed they were indeed often treated with respect and sometimes even saluted by the German soldiers.) The final scene is possibly the most chilling of all, as one officer, having endured the ordeal of the journey through the city's sewers but learning that some young fighters have been left behind (and are almost certainly already dead), goes back down into the sewers to find them, pulling the manhole cover back over his head ...",1154044800,8,1789,4.6645569620253164
541235,5,6303031382,"Andrzej Wajda's ""Kanal"" is a true cinematographic masterpiece both in substance and in form.

In substance, for it tells the truth of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 to the degree perhaps unmatched before and since. If the complexity of the event itself were not enough challenge, Andrzej Wajda tells this story in an unambiguous opposition to the official ""truth"" as maintained by the communist authorities then in power. And this is what impresses me most. For we must remember that Wajda created this film in 1956/1957 in Poland under the communist rule and Soviet domination. Although by then the worst of the Stalinist excesses were the matter of past and Poland - briefly - enjoyed considerable liberalization and ease of censorship, the essence of the political system with its Party control of all aspects of public life was still very much intact.

And the official interpretation of the Warsaw Uprising was anything but positive. This was the subject best left in complete silence as non-event. Obviously, it could not have been erased from the collective memory; the ruins of Warsaw, the tens of thousands of dead (more than a quarter million Varsovians perished to be exact), and those who survived were all too conscious witnesses to the harrowing tragedy that occurred just twelve years prior. But to censure, criticize, condemn, to denounce, and to deplore - yes, they very much could do it. And they did. According to the official interpretation, thus, the Home Army was not the largest and bravest underground resistance movement of patriots fighting the Nazi occupiers. They were Nazi collaborators, they were anti-socialist fanatics and renegades hostile to the Red Army, Soviet Union and everything that was deemed progressive and just. The invectives and persecutions went on. The Home Army resistance fighters were ""the enemies of the people"".

Andrzej Wajda portrays the soldiers of the Home Army as normal people, ""just like us"", who had their dreams, wanted to live their lives in peace, longed for love and fun... But they were also patriots, they were courageous and they fought for the right cause. They failed and Wajda also shows why. Not bluntly - that was impossible - he uses metaphors and symbols. But he leaves no doubt what was the Polish predicament. One of the final scenes is very telling: two of the soldiers, Caravel and Daisy, separated from the rest of the group, after long trek trough the sewers finally reach the end of the tunnel. They can see the river and the other bank where freedom (and the Red Army) awaits them... only to realize that the exit is barred. There is no freedom at the end. This episode is a metaphor for the whole Polish experience during World War II. After being ""liberated"" from the bloody German oppression, Poland has fallen to the Soviet domination.

""Kanal"" is equally a masterpiece in form. Nothing is overplayed, the actors play in a very controlled, yet natural way, tempo of the film is consistent, photography very realistic, light contrasting exactly the way it must have been in reality, the music adequately illustrative.

While praising the film for its mastery, I cannot say the same about the disc itself. Poor picture and sound transfer, as if the publisher was unaware of the technological achievements of the last decade and on top of that practically no additional features. This film virtually screams for the director's commentary and interviews with other, still alive, creators of the film. Without it much of the symbolism may be lost on the American viewer not necessarily well versed in the history of contemporary Poland. For these reasons, I think, the Criterion's box-set edition of all three War classics (also ""Generation"" and ""Ashes and Diamonds"") would be likely a better choice.",1126051200,8,3779,5.011146496815287
541236,4,6303031382,"Kanal focuses on a small group of Polish resistance fighters during the Warsaw uprising of 1944.  Intended to last for a few days and to enable the Soviet Army to enter Warsaw, the uprising lasted for weeks while the Red Army did little to assist the Poles and was eventually crushed by the Germans.  This film is based on an actual episode of the uprising, the escape from encirclement of a significant number of resistance fighters by fleeing through the sewers of Warsaw.  Wajda follows a company of fighters into the sewers and explores their disparate fates.  In Wajda's hands, this episode becomes a metaphor for the whole Polish experience in WWII; brutal, valiant, deadly, profoundly humiliating but characterized by an unceasing pursuit of hope.  With fine cinematography and excellent acting, this is a gripping film.",1093824000,21,827,5.051470588235294

541238,5,6303031382,"An indescribably wrenching war tragedy depicting the destruction of a group of freedom fighters in the ruins of Warsaw in the last year of WW II.
A year after the Warsaw ghetto is crushed, the Polish resistance, learning that Soviet armies are approaching the city and that the allies have landed in Normandy, order the long-awaited uprising against the Nazis. The battle goes on for 63 days while Stalin halts his army in the suburbs to allow the SS to systematically eliminate the last Polish patriots.
The film depicts the last few days of the uprising.  Wajda introduces the varied men and women who make up one resistance group - their ambitions, their loves, their individuality, their vitality, in a context of extreme stress. After a heroic defense of their district, the survivors are ordered into the sewers - the 'Kanal' - to escape the pocket in which they've become trapped. Their captain knows they are doomed yet hopes to save at least the company records for posterity. Before descending, he stoically shares a last cigarette with another group leader. 'You know this fight is  pointless, don't you?' 'Yeah... it's the Polish way.'
The second half of the film depicts their final trial of courage in the sewers - where a subterranean Passion and an anonymous Golgotha awaits them.
As the fighters, one by one, slip into a manhole behind a street barricade, they leave behind the rear guard - a twelve year old boy wearing boots way too big for him who cooly checks his rifle in preparation for his solitary defense of this last barrier. Beyond the pile of bricks and furniture a Tiger tank lurches inexorably forward like a threshing machine.
This film manages to scorch a lasting hole in one's soul.",983318400,30,1716,4.813559322033898

7835584,5,6303031382,"This old 1956 black and white film, with actors nobody ever saw in anything outside Poland, is nevertheless an absolute masterpiece and one of greatest films I ever saw. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The film begins on 25 September 1944 - it is the 56th day of Warsaw Uprising which lasted from 1 August to 2 October 1944. This uprising of Polish Home Army was defeated by German troops, with the intense fighting and the massacres carried by the SS causing the death of no less than 10 000 armed insurgents and possibly as much as 200 000 Polish civilians (this event is sadly frequently mistaken in the West with the earlier Warsaw Ghetto uprising in 1943).

In the opening scenes lieutenant ""Zadra"" (Wienczyslaw Glinski) and his second in command, lieutenant ""Madry"" (Emil Karewicz), lead a unit of 42 Home Army soldiers (and also one civilian) to a new position amidst the ruins of the Mokotw district of Warsaw. This unit used to be a company - but now is hardly more than a platoon. Amongst the most important characters are dashing young ensign ""Korab"", middle-aged company sergeant ""Kula"", handsome and fearless private ""Smukly"" and a particularly tough (but very attractive) woman-soldier ""Stokrotka"". We never learn their real names, as in Home Army soldiers served under assumed code-names, to protect their families from  reprisals. The meaning of their code names are as follows:

""Zadra"" - Shard
""Madry"" - Wise
""Korab"" - literally this is an old word for ""ship"", but it is also the name of a prestigious coat-of-arms of some of Polish nobility
""Kula"" - Bulet
""Smukly"" - Slender
""Stokrotka"" - Daisy

Everybody is worn down and exhausted by 56 days of fighting and amunition is scarce - especially there is only one projectile left for the unique PIAT (Projector Infantry Anti Tank) they have. A German attack inevitably occurs, supported first by a tank and then by a weapon even more feared by the insurgents - a ""Goliath"" robot (this is I believe the BEST scene ever showing this particular,  VERY REAL German weapon, indeed massively used against Warsaw Uprising). Butcher bill is heavy... In the evening, remaining soldiers are ordered to evacuate by the only way available, as Germans encircled the whole district - by the sewers!

All of that is just one third of the film. What follows is one of the most powerful, most dramatic, most heart-breaking and most incredible war time travels into the heart of darkness ever put on the screen. Those horrible retreats through the sewers were a very real thing during Warsaw Uprising and as the scenario was written by one of Home Army veterans and a genuine survivor of the uprising who actually really went through that underground ordeal the description of those events is very realistic, detailed and spares the viewer nothing.

A useful PRECISION here - this being a 1956 film, the ""yuckie factor"" which can be expected to be omnipresent in overflown sewers of a war time city, is actually kept to the strict minimum - some vague dark spots can be seen on clothes or faces but VERY WISELY the director didn't insist on that particular aspect...

The retreat through the sewers is obviously an allegory of descent into the hells and indeed we can almost see Dante's famous inscription over the entry to this undeground realm of darkness and death ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here..."". Finding the way out of this place is not easy, as many exists are being watched by Germans, other were purposefully collapsed and blocked by rubble - and many others are booby trapped...

Smoke grenades, tear gas and irritating fumes (obtained by throwing calcium carbide in water) are used by Germans to make the air in the sewers toxic - and cause the retreating soldiers and civilian to panic... Madness, shell shock and terminal exhaustion overtake some people already worn down by 56 days of continuous fighting and omnipresent death. This ordeal is already almost unbearable to those who are still in good shape - but it is even worse for the wounded. And finally, as in all self-respecting hell, our past sins come to catch up with us - BIG TIME!

This is an amazing, incredibly powerful war film, which will break your heart in a million pieces every five minutes or so - and the deeply moving, symbolic, beautiful ending can simply not be described by any words! This film is an ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE, to buy, watch and keep. You will not enjoy it - but you will NEVER forget it!",1400198400,,4473,4.796103896103896
7835585,1,6303031382,"This is a great movie, but the Polart Distribution conversion from the VHS to DVD sucks. half the movie is too dark to see, and the sound is greatly reduced. I'd opt for the Criterion Collection for better quality. It's a bit more money, but well worth it for the increase in quality and you also get the other two films in Wajda's War Trilogy.",1384387200,2,344,4.3076923076923075
7835586,4,6303031382,"This is another good historical film by Wajda which contains the same sort of realism as in his other films such as Ashes and Diamonds.

The film is about the Warsaw uprising of 1944 during the German occupation of World War II.  This movie was filmed in 1956 when much of Poland was apparently still in ruins and this makes the scenes extremely realistic.

The story takes place in the last days of the uprising and follows a company of the underground Polish resistance.  The first part shows them in ruined buildings surrounded by German forces.  Here we see many human relationships taking place which are presented incidentally to the main wartime events but end up being the most prominent (as in Ashes and Diamonds).

The besieged fighters then have to escape through the sewers of Warsaw and this constitutes the second and longer part of the movie.  The realistic scenes in the sewers portay them as being about as dark as they really were so most of the movie is filmed in almost total darkness making it hard to follow what's going on.  However this portrays the chaos and confusion the soldiers actually faced while navigating the sewers.  This part is hard slogging unless you are already interested in the story.

One remarkable thing about this movie is that it was filmed in Communist Poland in 1956 but there is no political propaganda in it.  Another is the only portrayal of the Germans when one of the resisters crawls out of a sewer through a manhole and is met by an armed German soldier.  Instead of the stereotypical scene where the German would shoot the rebel the German ends up taking his gun and arresting him.  It is this sort of realism that makes Wajda's films worth seeing.",1380412800,,1705,4.662207357859532

7835588,2,6303031382,"Kanal fascinates me as one of the best war movies ever made.  Each character shares a tragic story of bravery, cowardice, betrayal, and sacrifice.  However, this video copy was disappointing.  There was hardly any sound, even with the volume at the highest setting.  Granted, the movie is in Polish and I had to rely on subtitles, but there is more to communication than just words.  I missed the emotion in the voice, and missed the ambiance created by the sound effects.  Also the picture quality in the kanals seemed poorer than I had remembered, keeping me in near darkness.  Kanal is a great movie, but this video's quality was disappointing.",1350518400,2,647,4.827272727272727
7835589,5,6303031382,"The tragedy of the people who believed to the very end that the fight they had undertaken is right has found disturbing expression in Wajda's film. The drama assumes a shape of a metaphor, all the more meaningful because its ordinary heroes have been, for many years, forced into the shadows, into silcnce, to endure the mudslinging, false accusations and slander.
(Stanislaw Grzelecki, ""Zycie Warszawy"", Warsaw, 24 April 1957)

*****

The film is a Dantean nightmare. It is also an unforgettable testimonial. Is it a great film? Some of my colleagues on the steps of the Festival Palace in Cannes maintained that indeed it is. I must admit that I do not share their opinion. First, because about every war film there is always a kind of propaganda smell, unworthy of true greatness. Indeed, some matters should only be spoken of by the dead. Giraudoux was very firm about this. Second, because at times Wajda was unable to resist a certain romanticism of horror. Credible or not, it seems he could have dispensed with some images of a vaguely surrealistic nature. But let's be fair: these excesses aside, Andrzej Wajda's work is executed with the hand of a master and brilliantly acted. There are, unfortunately, experiences which must never be erased from human memory.
(Jeande Baroncelli, ""Le Monde"", Paris, 10 May, 1957)

*****

The dazzling quality of the photography, hard and meticulous, does a lot to enhance the drama. The damp darkness of the sewers, and the blinding brightness of the surface world support each other in creating an indescribable horror. The gloom, impenetrable and smothering, yet allowing for a vague hope for survival, and the merciless brightness, an illusory symbol of freedom which, nonetheless, involves the immediate presence of death. Having said this - and words do not suffice to express the full intensity of the drama - one must ask: can the viewer really participate in a film in which the horror reaches such unimaginable heights? And the horror and pity, aroused by the misfortunes of the characters, are they ends in themselves, since no relief, no hope is offered in the conclusion?
(Marcel Martin, ""Cinma"" 58, Paris, March 1958)

7835590,4,6303031382,"""Kanal' is a 1956 black and white Polish film (with subtitles) about the Warsaw Uprising. The ""Warsaw Uprising"" refers to a 2 month struggle by the Polish resistance movement to liberate Warsaw from Nazi occupation while the Russians were advancing. But the Russians slowed down their advance and the Poles were left to struggle alone against the Nazis, probably because the Russians wanted the Polish resistance weakened so they could control Poland uncontested after the war. The result was that tens of thousands of Poles and German fighters were killed or wounded, hundreds of thousands of civilians killed, and the city devastated.

The film takes place in September 1944 and follows a platoon of 43 resistance fighters (Home Army) as they make their way through the city's sewer system to escape a Nazi offensive. It's the second of 3 films by Andrzej Wajda about this period, a period in which he himself was a resistance fighter. Many of the others involved in the film were part of the resistance, and for  screen writer Jerzy Stefan Stawinski, the film is semi-autobiographical, with Stawinski represented by Lt. Zadra.

Wajda (1926) is a Polish film director who has 4 Oscar nominations for Best Foreign film - ""The Promised Land"" (1975), ""The Maids of Weilko"" (1979), ""Man of Iron"" (1981), and ""Katyri"" (2007) and won a BAFTA for ""Danton"" (1983). He won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for this film, ""Man of Marble"" (1977), ""Bez znieczulenia"" (1978) and ""Man of Iron"" (1981).

When the film appeared, Stalin has been dead for only 3 years and the de-Stalinization of Poland was only just starting. Post WW 2 Communist rule of Poland continued for 40+ years, ending in 1989. So the appearance of this film in 1956 is truly remarkable, although the Russian's part in this massacre is never mentioned and ostensibly the film is merely about the struggle between the Nazis and the resistance.

Although one has to admire the film makers, the film is not without its problems. The musical score runs the gamut from intrusive to absent, and rarely helps. The uniforms look like they were just delivered from the costume office - they are clean and show no signs of wear and tear. Special effects are clearly less than spectacular. And from a plot POV, the issue of hunger is never nearly raised, so that the obvious life and death struggle in the sewers seems a little contrived without understanding the impact that starvation has on their strength.

Leaving these relatively minor issues behind, the acting and photography are excellent. This genre falls into the ""see who's gonna get it next"" type of film (e.g., ""Journey to Shiloh"", ""The Great Escape"") and conforms to the standard. We get a glimpse of the type of character, follow them for a while, and then, in many different ways (e.g., suicide, homicide, drowning, madness, death by exhaustion) they are dispatched. The ending is particularly powerful.

This isn't a perfect film, but it was made under very difficult circumstances and the end product is none the less noteworthy. This will appeal to any fan of war films, and to history fans (since this is one of the very few films to deal with the Warsaw Uprising), and to people who see what can be done with limited budget and difficult circumstances.",1306195200,,3265,4.872072072072072
7835591,4,6303031382,"The Bottom Line:

Wajda's classic war film takes a little bit of a while to really get interesting (the battle scenes above ground/character development we see occurring is nothing terribly new or fascinating) but once the main characters descend into the sewer and start fighting through muck and grime, Kanal develops into a very compelling picture unlike any I've seen; it's not quite as polished as Ashes and Diamonds, but if you like seeing different shades of World War II then check out this vision of the Warsaw Uprising/the lower depths of Hades.
