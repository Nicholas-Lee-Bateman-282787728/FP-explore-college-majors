6492404,5,B00LMUVA06,"If you believe or would like to believe in a loving God, this is a must see.  Mr. Fudge is an honest man that set out
to defend his position on Hell.  Tireless research through Scripture, History, Publications etc. result in an honest

6492405,4,B00LMUVA06,"I did enjoy this movie, but it wasn't what I expected. I have already read ""The Fire That Consumes"" and Hell: A Final Word"" by Edward Fudge and I expected the movie to be more scholarly than it was. I can appreciate Mr. Fudges efforts, but the movie seemed to more about a personal feud with a college classmate than a real argument for conditional immortality. If I were not already a conditionalist, this movie would not have convinced me to become one. There is a lot of rhetoric but little substance. Mr. Fudge has written a couple of fantastic books, and I do realize that the movie is never as good as the book; plus I know that my expectations were high because I've already read the books, so that is why I gave the movie four stars. Perhaps someone who is new to the conditional immortality position will get a lot more out of the movie than I did.",1416009600,10,857,4.329192546583851

6492407,5,B00LMUVA06,"It only scratches the surface of the subject of conditional immortality, but it's a good introduction to it. I hope it encourages people to read Edward Fudge's books and realize that we do have a fair and loving God. While I don't agree with everything Fudge teaches, I've done the ""hellfire"" study myself, long before I ever heard of his, and I do agree with his view that hellfire consumes and finally ends. Eternal torture is simply one of many doctrines that made its way from paganism into the early medieval church.

I haven't watched many Christian movies, but the acting seemed better than in the few Christian movies I've seen.  It's a low-budget film that doesn't scream to me, ""low budget!"" because it really doesn't need a lot of added stuff to get its point across.",1414454400,3,778,4.671532846715328

6492419,1,B00LMUVA06,"""The traditional doctrine of eternal torment raises a plethora of issues aside from the obvious biblical ones. Some of these arise from our innate sense of justice and fairness.
Most of us want to see wrongs made right. We want fair and reasonable punishment for crimes. We want our out-of-kilter world to be brought into proper balance. We have a natural revulsion to eternal torment because it seems to be justice gone wrong. It's overkill. The punishment is out of proportion to the crime. The longer eternity lasts, the further out of balance things get.
Some will argue that sin is a crime against the sovereign, infinite God; it stands to reason that such a crime deserves infinite punishment. This idea harks back to medieval justice systems, where the punishment for a crime depended on the class status of the victim. An offense against someone who is your peer might bring a light sentence. Commit a similar crime against someone of a superior class  a lord or a king  and you could get a death sentence. This kind of justice grates on us as being patently unfair.
Old Testament rules for social order and justice include the ""eye for an eye"" principle. This is commonly referred to by the Latin lex talionis. Lex is ""law."" Talionis gives us our English word ""talion,"" meaning lawful retaliation equal in degree to the damage resulting from the crime. Lex talionis, on the face of it, seems fair and just.
The ""eye for an eye"" principle was to be applied to all, regardless of social standing. All classes were declared to be equal under the law. This impartiality seems reasonable and evenhanded. It appeals to our moral nature.
If we believe that in some sense we are formed in the image of God it's logical to assume that we share, to some extent, His moral nature. Our best ideas about what's fair and just and right must, to some degree, reflect His. Whether this is by nature or nurture may be arguable; the result is the same.
An enlightened sense of justice is God-like. When we are repulsed by the very idea of eternal torment we are like Him.""

***

So reads the description of the film, Hell and Mr. Fudge, on the website of its Hollywood production company, D' Artagnan Entertainment, producers of films on the Mafia and by ""good Vatican man,"" Mel Gibson. D' Artagnan, you may remember, was the 17th century historical figure killed fighting the Dutch during the Franco-Dutch War (Catholic v. Protestant), glamorized by Dumas in fictional works such as The Three Musketeers. An interesting bit of information is that D'Artagnan had a career in espionage for Cardinal Mazarin, meaning the man was a Jesuit coadjutor. All in all a curious choice of name for a ""Christian"" film production company, although that it is Christian is itself a jump to conclusions that flies in the face of the evidence of their filmography. Doubly curious to be producing a Seventh-Day Adventist film, such as this one, given the denominations historically anti-Jesuit leanings (leanings I, although no Adventist, agree with given an objective, non-pro-Rome assessment of the past 450+ years history).

""Commit a similar crime against someone of a superior class  a lord or a king  and you could get a death sentence. This kind of justice grates on us as being patently unfair.

Except this is to completely misconstrue the point of who God is, who we are, what sin is, and Who it is ultimately against. Sin is not simply against certain other humans at some times and against ""someone of a superior class"" (I assume they mean God, who IS actually of a superior class! let's be real), it may be committed against His creatures, but it is ALWAYS ultimately against HIM. Never lose sight of that. You may take my car and crash it and you will have certainly done harm to my car, but you will have ultimately wronged ME because I am the rightful owner of my car! Does God have no less claim over those He has given the very breath of life? Our freedom is a gift, but it does not free us from our responsibility or remove His rightful claim over our lives. Such thinking is rebellious, pig-headed and obtuse and certainly anything but Biblical.

From this utterly flawed starting point, other errors follow, other degradings of God's truth. As one who loves God with my whole heart, I fight against such underminings of His Word--- not to win an argument or defeat a foe, but for the sake of the Gospel, for the sake of potentially keeping would-be followers of Christ from being led astray. And because the Truth is worth fighting for. Ultimately, the argument advanced in the film's description, leads one to assess God and the clear teaching laid forth in Scripture, even the very ""red letters"" spoken by Christ on earth, to be unreasonable. It is a humanist (man-centered) mindset, inherently opposed to the truth of Christ and therefore a stronghold to be torn down per our instruction in 2Corinthians 10:5,
""Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;""

""He's going to burn forever just for wanting to see the world."" young Fudge cried upon hearing his friend, the rebel Davey, had perished in a wreck.

""You see, if you have a friend and suddenly he's gone and you're told he's burning forever in hell, that would change you."" Fudge's mother declares, neglecting the obvious that the wonder is that no one deserves anything BUT eternal torment and the wonder is that a way has been made whereby God may forgive us the debt we rightly owe and that anyone spurning that is where he ought to be and if we truly care we should not be hanging out smoking and drinking and making light of the Gospel but proclaiming it to lost souls lest they perish and leave this world without the only means of salvation.

But instead, we must follow our fickle heartstrings to a man-centered watering down of Scripture that would cast God as a big meanie for casting those who spit on His Son into eternal torment. So, if the question is to be one of duration, then let us play God the further and speak of appropriate terms. Let's start with the monsters of our race and work down.

Hitler. We would agree the butchering of eight million Jews and several millions of others a reprehensible horror. How long should Hitler burn before he has suffered enough? A million years (we cannot help but speaking in finite terms though hell is outside the finite realm)? Is a billion years sufficient torment for the torture of men women and children? For gassing the mentally ""unfit""? For separating husbands from wives and children from parents and exterminating them like vermin? How is it the man will at some point be shown the mercy of ceasing to be tormented he did not show others?

Now, we quickly work down from our race's worst to one of its best. This benevolent creature is of course, ourselves. Or Granny the well-intentioned soul who never had time for God but dotes on the grandchildren. Surely the fires of hell should be spared her torments. But, the Bible says to hate another in ones heart is no different a sin than murder. It is killing that which has been created in the very image and likeness of God in ones heart. And what soul has trod this earth without once feeling hate?
What is the appropriate sentence for such a horror? Can time be named?

""People are partial to the truth that they've already got."" As they should be if the truth they've already got is from the eternal, unchanging word of God. I would argue we should ALWAYS be partial to the truth and prejudiced against falsehood, no matter how likeable the one spreading it may be.

Let God be true and every man a liar.

""Hell is a fire that consumes."" Fudge proclaims at debate to great ovation.

This is found nowhere in Scripture. It might be the annihilationist interpretation of Scripture, but to say it is Scripture would be no different than saying Scripture states the soul is immortal. The difference being the latter can be derived from Scripture (Matthew 25:46; Daniel 12:2-3; Mark 3:29, etc.) whereas the former is not only a misinterpretation but also something considerably worse: it attributes to hellfire what Scripture attests to being the Divine Nature of God.

""For our God is a consuming fire."" Hebrews 12:29

Hell, to the contrary, is spoken of, BY CHRIST HIMSELF, as an eternal fire which burns but NEVER consumes.
""...hell fire: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."" Mark 9:47b-48

No amount of wishful thinking can change the words of Scripture, no matter how many times the purveyors of the annihilationist view claim the Bible is on their side and the eternal hell view is Biblically-unfounded. Curiously, this movie repeated this very claim throughout while never demonstrating it. Instead, we received a steady stream of emotional invective meant to tug at, what I see as being, a misplaced sense of justice that is no justice at all and takes a view of sin I believe, from what I see illustrated throughout the Scriptures, to be a far more flippant one than that of God, Who apparently felt and feels so seriously about it He sent His own Son to die on our behalf rather than dismiss the sentence due it--- a sentence of eternal magnitude in that sin is ultimately against the eternal and infinite God. Sin is not finite crimes deserving a finite sentence. We do not live in a bubble though this temporal existence is a prenthesis in eternity. We ALL exist forever. It's just that we do not all LIVE forever.

There are a mountain of other points to be addressed concerning this movie's failure to comport with Biblical Christianity. But if the initial points are rejected, those will be rejected also. I would just entreat anyone truly searching the truth on this topic to seek out the best arguments on BOTH sides of the issue and not take this movie as the final verdict. I doubt even an annihilationist seriously debating his or her view would try to use this film to prove their case because...this film is feather-light on argumentation and lead-heavy on emotional pleading, a methodology that gets torn to shreds in serious academic discourse.",1493510400,2,10187,4.717660292463442

For an overview of conclusion Mr Fudge made based on his research, view the Youtube lecture by him entitled ""The Fire That Consumes"" and for details of his research, read his book by the same title. It is easy to dismiss this point of view simply because it's not orthodox. But who said orthodoxy was a guarantee for truth? Would the message of this movie be detrimental to salvation? No. Could it affect the decision by some to become followers of Jesus? Quite possibly, if they can see God as a loving and just God, and not as the God of imposing the heinous punishment mainstream Christianity promotes.

The movie only refers to those scriptures that support his stance on hell, rather than all references to hell.  I do not think that we could go 2,000+ years before the Lord would reveal His real meanings on hell, nor that it would be revealed in this way.  I was expecting something else, and do not recommend this movie.  In order to be saved from hell (no matter how you define it) that one must accept the sacrificial and atoning death of Christ - that He died for your/my specific sins.  There will be a judgement one day for everyone.  So, read the actual Word of God, the Old and the New Testament, pray for discerning wisdom as you read it, and the Lord will give you the understanding that you seek.",1468713600,3,789,4.444444444444445

The film is not boring but it is low-key and understated in a way. You have to really pay attention with interest to get the ""meat"" out of this film. It is written more to educate than to entertain, though it is somewhat entertaining.

I wish he were still much younger so he could put the same magnifying glass to the issues of Bible versions and the LGBT question.

I assuredly see the hand of God in his life.  I was a preacher myself for twenty years and another twenty years as a hospice chaplain and I can relate to some of his journey.

That quote from this movie pretty much says it all -- many people people they already have a corner on the truth, and they don't have much patience for anyone who says we should consider otherwise.

Jesus told the Pharisees that it was because they said they could see, they in fact were blind. It is only when we admit in our deepest selves that even some of the beliefs we hold most dear might be in err. And not as a statement of false humility, but as a statement before the Lord as we beg Him to search us and try us, to see if there is anything in us that breaks His heart.

""Hell & Mr. Fudge"" is the story of a well-respected man who came to new conclusions, and it's about the backlash of condemnation he received because of it. We say we're united by the blood of Christ alone and not by our stance on doctrine .... until we find doctrine we no longer agree upon. Then what?

I know this because my husband and I have walked this path. ""Hell & Mr. Fudge"" does a great job of showcasing the emotional wear & tear heaped upon a person who had the audacity to allow the Holy Spirit lead them to an unpopular conclusion.",1446595200,17,1185,4.18859649122807

6492463,3,B00LMUVA06,"Twenty years ago I took a course in apologetics at Trinity Western University. The main assignment was a debate in front of the class at the end of the semester. My friend and I were given the task of defending annihilationism  the view that hell constitutes the final destruction of the unregenerate  over-against the traditional view of eternal conscious torment.

While I started off my research as a mere academic exercise, by the time I mounted the podium to present my case, I had become a convinced annihilationist.

The most important single book in my shift of position was written by a theologian named Edward Fudge. ""The Fire That Consumes"", published in 1982, provided a powerful summary of biblical, historical, and philosophical sources, and helped shift my thinking as a young undergraduate in favor of annihilationism. (A couple years later I solidified my position when I wrote a graduate paper on hell for theologian Stanley Grenz titled Who in Hell Lives Forever?)

So I was surprised and intrigued a couple years ago when I first learned of the 2012 film Hell and Mr. Fudge which depicts the backstory of Edward Fudge and his adoption of annihilationism. The story begins with the untimely death of 13 year old Edwards rebellious friend in the early 1950s, a tragedy that raises the haunting spectre of a troubled youth spending eternity suffering in the Lake of Fire. It continues on through his time at Bible college in the early 1960s as he learned to ask hard questions and pursue the truth whatever the cost. And it continues on as he began life as a struggling pastor, one who would lose his job by forcing the issue of racial integration. All the while, Fudge continued his dauntless pursuit to understand hell as an independent researcher.

""Hell and Mr. Fudge"" has the modest production values of your typical Christian movie. For example, while Edward Fudge is played capably by Mackenzie Astin, there was clearly no money in the budget for makeup: to be blunt, a 39 year old Astin looks a bit absurd playing an 18 year old freshman at Bible college.

The movie is Christian in other ways as well. For example, the screenplay is rather bland and forgettable. But even so, I was never bored while watching ""Hell and Mr. Fudge"". Indeed, given my own experiences chafing against the sometimes constraining and reactionary wings of conservative Protestantism, I could certainly sympathize with Edward Fudge as he wrestled with the doctrine of eternal conscious torment and those who would seek to quash his inquiry.

Along the way, the narrative does a decent job of informing the average viewer of Fudges reasoning from scripture and tradition, as well as his pivotal revelation where he realizes that the eternality of the soul is a foreign import to Judeo-Christian anthropology by way of Platonic philosophy. (To be sure, that hardly settles the issue: after all, just because something is Greek in origin hardly entails that it is thereby wrong.)

The film ends with Fudge addressing a crowd in the wake of the publication of ""The Fire that Consumes,"" a book that the film rather grandiosely describes as one of the most influential tomes on hell ever written. (As important as the book may be in the discussion over the last thirty years, that accolade still seems a bit of a stretch.)

""Hell and Mr. Fudge"" helps itself to other indulgences to spur the tale including the impression that annihilationism was unknown from the time of the New Testament until Edward Fudge. That is nothing more than the screenwriters conceit, as is the grossly uncharitable dismissal of the majority tradition of eternal conscious torment as nothing more than a lie.

But the real takeaway lesson here is not simply about the nature of hell, however important a topic that may be. Rather, it is about the nature of truth and our freedom to pursue what we understand that truth to be over-against the reactionary forces of tradition, conservatism, and fear.

The challenge is captured memorably in one exchange between Edward and an elderly pastor whose counsel he seeks immediately prior to going on the radio to share his new-found convictions about the temporary nature of the punishments of hell. The pastor doesnt discourage Edward from pursuing and proclaiming the truth as he sees it, but he does warn Edward that the forces of conservative tradition may see things differently:

Folks are partial to the truth that theyve already got. If you come marching up with some brand new 200 watt light, folks gonna say, whoa, wait a minute. Too much light. I prefer that itty bitty light at the back of the refrigerator.'

Thats sage advice. Many folks do indeed remain partial to the truth theyve already got. Hell is forever! they say. Thats just the way it is. Some things will never change.

But, if I may be permitted an indulgence of my own, don't you believe it.

6492471,4,B00LMUVA06,"First, the positive.  I really liked the movie as entertainment.  For a 'Christian' movie, the acting and screen play and camera work were above average.  It wasn't 'just' a sermon disguised as a movie.  The movie showed the human side of Mr. Fudge and his struggle with the traditional concept of hell.  He came across as a real person dealing with an incredibly difficult concept and not a super saint with all the answers like his nemesis in college whose portrayal was maybe a little over the top.  All in all an entertaining and family friendly movie although it would be most suitable for teenagers and older.
Now, the downside.  Like a couple other reviews, I believe the concept of annihlation he was struggling with got confused with the denominational issues which were more than just the hell issue and you don't realize that until late in the movie.  I also agree that the movie tried to do too much with the denomination battle and getting across in a clear way the concepts he was wrestling with. One of those issues was enough.  I did not think the cards on the board were the best visual to convey his message.  The other issue I would have liked to see was whether or not he struggled with the concept of did God actually create hell.  If God didn't create hell in the first place and it was created by man's rebellion against God, then the discussion takes a completely different turn.  For all the discussion about what happens to people in hell, maybe hell wasn't God's creation in the first place and He has allowed people to go their own way and live separated from Him which is really the definition of hell.  If, as the movie states, it's all about God's character, not ours, then it would be hard to believe of an all loving God creating Hell, even though he might, in His gift of freedom to humanity allow us to create our own hells.  I also liked the emphasis in the movie about building bridges not erecting walls with those who don't see things exactly the way we do.  God was the original bridge builder in sending Jesus.  All in all, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend watching it but you will need more to really grasp the concepts he is dealing with.",1432425600,4,2188,4.487373737373737

6492483,3,B00LMUVA06,"There are 3 decent ways to get exposure to Mr. Fudge and his weighty scholarly research on hell.  This movie is probably the 3rd best way.  First best is Fudge's most recent book on hell called: ""Hell, A Final Word"".  This concise, readable, and well-written book gives you Fudge's life AND a his support for his view on hell.  Second best is viewing Fudge's one hour lecture on-line at the Lanier Theological Library website.  He goes fast to get all his support in, plus you get him in person and you can take a measure of the man--he's sweet, funny, and well meaning.

This movie gives you Fudge's life story and tries its derndest to get exposed you to Fudge's view of hell.  That is a monumental task and the movie doesn't do it well.  Here are the problems:  The movie tries to tackle two issues: 1) Fudge going against his conservative denomination (Church of Christ) on their view that only folks from their denomination are saved, and 2) the storyline and theology of Fudge's view of hell which also goes against his denomination.  This is too much.  The issues mix and merge and get confused.  Also, the movie has a documentary inside a documentary format and that confuses things even more and plain ole just doesn't work well.  This movie doesn't give you the context of the exclusivity of salvation view of the Church of Christ as a back drop to the story.  Then, the average viewer is shocked out of its gourd when in a debate near the end, Fudge's main opponenet clearly states that Baptists & Lutherans aren't saved.  This should have been told at the beginning because it is the main thing that Fudge is fighting in his life and in the movie.  It is just all so unclear in the movie.

All that being said, the movie really does give you a good feel for the man and his life story and you do get a little smidgen of his arguments against a traditional view of hell.  For me it was ""The Little Movie That Tried To Do Too Much"".",1421712000,9,1942,4.422535211267606

Essentially, this film proposes the ""annihilationist theory"" (conditional idea) of hell - complete with opposing viewpoints to it - but in a narrative film regarding Mr. Fudge's personal story and struggle as a college student and later as a preacher.

The main character, Mr. Fudge, attempts to solve the mystery and debate of hell found within the Bible, which contrary to many people's beliefs, there isn't much about hell in the Good Book.  However, what little the Bible actually says of hell contradicts what many Christians and Catholics believe (eternal punishment, common with the traditional view).  Mr. Fudge wrestles with these ideas and finds heavy, unChristian-like opposition from his own so-called brothers and sisters of Christ who want to shut down any dissenting views.  Sometimes Christians don't act very Christian, and that's apparent from Mr. Fudge's real-life encounters with those in his own church.

Throughout the film, Mr. Fudge points to Biblical evidence contradicting the traditional view.  He does not believe that the soul is immortal, but that hell destroys the soul.  He suggests that the soul doesn't exist in torment (hell) for all eternity.  The destruction of the soul is eternal, but the torment itself is not; just as a fire consumes a log, it doesn't burn forever.  The soul is either given eternal life by God and granted access to heaven, or, rejected and destroyed in hell.

The film gives both sides, traditional versus conditional (aka annihilationist), a say throughout the story, but obviously focuses more on the conditional/annihilation idea.  Mr. Fudge's struggle between the two ideas is common throughout the movie, and is natural for anyone addressing this topic.

I've held the traditional viewpoint for the vast majority of my life until I stumbled across the ""annihilationist"" idea from a life-long friend who secretly believed in it as well.  After hearing the idea and reading Biblical portions dealing with hell, the conditional/annihilationist idea simply makes more sense, agrees with notions of Jesus, and supported by Scripture.
Could Mr. Fudge and myself be wrong?  Of course, and I accept that.  Can you accept the possibility that you might be wrong as well?

Regardless of one's belief, watch the film, study and contemplate, then decide for yourself.  This film is a great asset to Christianity.",1524960000,,2633,5.339805825242719

He gave the illustration of Ghana which was a garbage dump that burned day and night to illustrate hell.  Would have been nice if the movie focused on Jesus hard teachings and not that He is all love.
