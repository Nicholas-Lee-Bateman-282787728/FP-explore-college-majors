1886856,1,B00009OWDS,"With shipping it cost me over $19.00, and all it is one episode with the Indian boy film in front taking a lot of time off of the total.  With a short Andy Devine and Froggy at the end of the DVD.  It is not worth it, check out on ""You Tube"" there are several shorts to watch with Andy Devine and Froggy and they are free.",1349222400,2,322,3.791044776119403
1886857,4,B00009OWDS,It was a great collection of the first season.  Cannot wait for season 2.,1243209600,,73,4.214285714285714
1886858,1,B00009OWDS,"I made a mistake of not checking the description, I bought Andys Gang with Hey Kids thinking it would have more shows. The DVD was just one show and the same show that was on Hey Kids. Buy Hey Kids instead Andys Gang is just a big rip, Hey Kids cost a little more but it has 21 great shows.",1217721600,19,290,3.85
1886859,1,B00009OWDS,"I feel so ripped off.  I paid $14.95 for 1 20-min epsidoe that runs in a loop on the DVD.  The quality is fine considering the technology that was available for shooting in the 50's.  You get Andy Devine reading a story, meet Froggie and the Orangutan.  Where is Midnight the Cat and Squeeky the Mouse?  Normally, when I buy these types of DVDs there is on average 4 epsiodes.  Don't bother wasting your money.",1195776000,47,410,4.4
1886860,2,B00009OWDS,I was a little disappointed that there was too much of the film about the indian boy and not enough of the actually Andy's gang. I wanted to see all of the character and not just a film insert.,1149465600,16,193,3.9743589743589745
7992162,1,B00009OWDS,"Very disappointed. I was expecting the full show with Midnight the Cat, Squeaky the Mouse, Froggie the Gremlin and the professor as well as the low budget serials. That's not what you get. Don't waste your time.",1503964800,,211,4.72972972972973
7992163,1,B00009OWDS,DVD arrived on time but was flawed and could not be played. Not the fault of Amazon but of the maker.,1502668800,,101,3.857142857142857

7992165,1,B00009OWDS,"WHAT!!!??
Only one episode and not even a Gunga Ram one?  Thanks to everyone for tipping me off.  I've found about 12-15 episodes of this show floating around.  If anyone knows where there are more, do feel free to plump your magic twanger to this page.
NICE!

By the way, the film SABAKA (aka THE HINDU) with Boris Karloff was produced by the producer of ANDY'S GANG and features the cast of the Gunga stories from those episodes.  The villainess of the film is played by June Foray, the voice of Rocket J. Squirrel!  There has to be some story there.  Those ANDY'S GANG serials are a complete mystery.  They seem to have footage from a different India-shot film mixed in with scenes of American actors on cheap sets.  These are edited with scenes in India with the actors obvious doubles who are always shot from behind with the faces hid.  I wonder if ANY of the Americans ever set foot in India?",1449446400,2,899,4.460122699386503

7992167,1,B00009OWDS,Were are other Andy gang shows,1434240000,,30,4.166666666666667
7992168,1,B00009OWDS,Like some others I feel ripped off. I should have read the reviews. This was one of my favorite shows growing up[ and I am disappointed that there was only one episode & that one wasn't a Gunga Ram the Jungle Boy story. I guess you live & learn!!!!,1418688000,2,248,4.081632653061225

7992170,1,B00009OWDS,The dvd contained only one 22 minute show...not worth the price! I was very disappointed with this purchase and my money was reimbursed.,1377388800,4,136,4.956521739130435
7992171,4,B00009OWDS,Was disappointed. Very limited video. A lot was left off that has been included in other videos of the same title.,1359331200,,114,4.476190476190476
