8463522,5,B005APLBY4,"""Circus Maximus"" is a straight to DVD feature written, produced, and directed by rising New York City Independent film director Thomas J. LaSorsa or better known as ""Tommy"".  Tommy is the same writer/director who brought us the movie ""All Saints Day"" which is now often confused with the subtitle for ""The Boondock Saints II:  All Saints Day"", however the original film by Tommy LaSorsa centers around a bumbling cast of idiots hell bent on getting revenge against a fish market owner who treats his staff harshly and do so by conducting a haphazardly planned unarmed burglary and the misadventures of the burglars preparing and executing the burglary plan.  It is clear that Tommy's first foray into movie making allowed him to draw from the experiences creating ""All Saints Day"" when writing the script to ""Circus Maximus"" and then directing the subsequent film.  The ""Circus Maximus"" Facebook page provides the following synopsis: ""An edgy, dark-comedy that features an all-star, ensemble cast that includes: Julian McCullough, Mario Cantone, Kevin Corrigan, Sal ""The Stockbroker"" Governale, Joe Gannascoli, Rachel Feinstein and Bianca Hunter.""

""Circus Maximus"" is a unique take on the classic storyline of the ultimate procrastinator (Cal Neros portrayed by Kevin Corrigan) who, through a literal comedy of errors was given a year and a money advance to provide a script to a movie studio that involves three intersecting storylines, each more ridiculous than the one prior.  The deadline for his script to be delivered to the movie studio has already come and gone and the screenwriter is approaching a firm deadline and he is hopelessly suffering from writer's block -not helping his situation is a studio executive (Mario Cantone) breathing down his neck.  The story centers around the screenwriter's ideas as they come to life on his laptop and are completed on a circa 1940's typewriter.
""Circus Maximus"" intersects storylines in a unique way not often undertaken by directors due to complexity - a simple mistake made during the direction of any of the intersecting parts can result in the need to completely re-shoot an entire sequence of events in order to arrive at the desired result: comedy gold with seamless segues from dream sequences and sequences considered ""real life"" within the movie.  Tommy LaSorsa masterfully mixes comedy with plot direction and leaves you wanting more from the unique characters developed throughout the entire movie - including those ""in real life"" and those who are created as a part of the script written by the procrastinating screenwriter.  In the end the three storylines created by our struggling procrastinating screenwriter intersect with his real life through a period of intense frustration coupled with sleep deprivation and constant badgering by his needy girlfriend (Rachel Feinstein) and the studio executive eager to receive his completed script for delivery to the studio ownership.  As can be expected with any good comedy film, excellent dialog along with subtle references to pop culture and/or regional customs offer fast-paced dialog; it is here where the viewer is most rewarded with deep belly laughs followed-up by many short chuckles.  Depending upon your style of humor the deep belly laughs may occur in different places than other people in your viewing party.  Rapid-fire dialog is common throughout many of the parts of the film which do require the viewer's attention if he or she is to understand the overall plot as well as the subtleties added for the sake of comedy.  In the spirit of comedy writing similar to that of Kevin Smith, Tommy LaSorsa's characters come to life through a brief and unique introduction but are brought to life by their dialogue and as a viewer you feel as though you have been introduced to these characters and you may even find yourself relating some of the characters with people you know in your own life including yourself.

""Circus Maximus"" brings together a unique cast of NYC actors and comedians who play all of their parts to perfection.  The surprising work of Sal `The Stockbroker' Governale of the Howard Stern Show and Howard TV is a complete departure from his previous work as a part-time stand-up comedian and full-time prank caller.  As a fan of the Howard Stern Show I am aware that Sal Governale is often portrayed as a moron by Howard, however Sal's acting in the movie is as solid as a rock - in stark contrast to the Sal Governale known and loved by Howard Stern fans.  The choice of Mario Cantone as the studio executive actually added the opportunity for Mario to diversify his acting as he is most famously known as ""That Gay Guy from Sex in the City"" - Mario also fails to disappoint in his role which albeit small is critical to the success of the story.  The remaining cast does an excellent job in their roles including the part portrayed by Director Tommy LaSorsa as a private investigator who gets more than he bargained for from a bizarre client.

If you are looking for a unique comedy film to watch I highly recommend ""Circus Maximus"" as your choice.  ""Circus Maximus"" is unique enough in its premise as well as intersecting plotlines to keep your attention while providing rapid-fire laughs.",1317340800,2,5234,5.014994232987313
