7982375,4,B00008FAPD,"One of the last starring roles and the sole directorial credit for the legendary Mexican comedian Germ&aacute;n Vald&eacute;s, aka Tin-Tan, who also wrote and produced. Also, half his family is in it. One sort of suspects that this might have been little more than an expanded record of the family vacation in Acapulco - but one would be wrong.

The plot, while somewhat slipshod (and, please note, my Spanish is barely adequate, so I am probably missing certain subtleties that a native speaker would not), is a bit more complex, even self-reflexive, than one would expect from a movie of this sort, with a flashback structure and a clearly self-conscious, ironic authorial stance. Something tells me that Jacques Tati would have approved.

But meta-critical analysis detracts from the film's more basic, up-front charms, which are plentiful, from Tin-Tan's 'dual' role (as younger and older versions of the title character), to the improvised-feeling musical numbers, comical fight scenes, 'wacky' sound effects and cartoon-ish characterizations of the supporting cast. Yes, it's pretty broad as humor goes, but if you're a fan of Tin-Tan, you know what to expect and you get what you want here.",1344038400,,1197,5.196891191709844
