8566622,5,B00BD7V5HG,"I saw the documentary ""Only the Young"" on PBS one night and loved it so much I felt the need to order the dvd!",1377388800,,110,3.625
8566623,3,B00BD7V5HG,"Only the young is a well filmed story about coming of age. It's easy to watch all the way through and the scenery is gorgeous. Unfortunately, I felt the story was too benign and the scenes that were supposed to be emotional just left me a little confused. I kind of wish Diablo Cody got a hold of this material and made something really worth watching.",1376179200,,352,4.348484848484849

8566625,5,B00BD7V5HG,"Hail to the power of small budget, independent films!  These movies tell gripping, yet everyday, kinds of stories with a dramatic intensity offset by a kicked back real life feeling.  The performances are natural and heartfelt, and it sounds like real people talking...because it is.  Unforgettable glimses into worlds of which I knew virtually nothing about, the movies slide from scene to scene almost effortlessly, but kept my interest every minute.  Forget the big commercial mainstream Hollywood blockbusters...my money is on independent cinema, especially with clever offerings such as these films.",1373155200,,604,5.604395604395604
8566626,5,B00BD7V5HG,"Only The Young is an inspiring documentary that anyone who's been a teenager can relate to. The film allows the characters to open up in a very personal way, giving viewers a sense of what life is like and how they react and deal with the problems they come across. The story is simple, yet very insightful and fun to watch. I felt like I was able to connect with the characters, reminding me of my own teenage years. Definitely recommend.",1367280000,,439,4.432098765432099

In ""Only the Young"" Elizabeth Mims and Jason Tippet capture the majesty and bare reality of life as adulthood closes in on Garrison Saez, Kevin Conway, and Sky Elmore during their last year of high school. What may come off  merely as adolescent drama, is, in the hands of these directors, an authentic, moving coming of age story. The Mims and Tippet have bottled intense feelings of love, excitement, pain, and anxiety of life in such a way that no matter the viewer's age or background it all tastes the same going down. Bitter, and sweet, and familiar. ""Only the Young"" tastes like growing up.

The cinematography is beautiful and the subjects human. We see the darkness in Kevin, the poetry in how they care for each other through inelegant sentences. Spending the majority of their time in quiet, abandoned and empty spaces we witness how they create something out of nothing. ""Only the Young"" is a wonderful and emotional journey as you watch Garrison, Kevin and Sky try on different selves and, ultimately, walk out into the world.

The experience of New Orleans is not easily put into words. One could describe the culture of New Orleans as rich, and that would still be an understatement. Through the fresh eyes of three young boys, a night out in New Orleans becomes a wondrous  experience of nightlife at the intersection of innocence and the forbidden. Tchopitoulas is a gem, just like the city it was filmed in.",1362009600,2,1455,4.776892430278885
