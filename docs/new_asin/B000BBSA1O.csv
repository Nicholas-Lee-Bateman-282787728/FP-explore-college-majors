8084749,5,B000BBSA1O,"This is, hands down, the best video for traveling with young (2-8 years old) children. The songs are catchy, but not TOO catchy, smart, and interesting. Even though my kids are older now, we still enjoy it from time to time as a ""remember when we went...."" moment.",1343260800,2,264,4.520833333333333
8084750,5,B000BBSA1O,"We love Away We Go!!  The music is fabulous and the good vibe is contagious.  You just can't help but sing along!  Newt, Casey and Samantha's lives in New York are so different from ours in Atlanta -- it's really fun to go through the day with them and imagine what it would be like to live in a building with an elevator, hop in a cab or ride the bus around town. Personally, I can't get enough of the dancing in the elevator ~ just thinking about it puts a smile on my face and a little boogie in my step.  All families will love this sweet DVD.",1127779200,5,547,3.9908256880733943
8084751,5,B000BBSA1O,"My  kids (6 year old boy and 2 1/2 year old girl) love this DVD. In fact when they were asked to pick 4 DVD's to take along on vacation they both picked AWAY WE GO, and they watched it more than any of the others they took along. The sights, the sounds and the adventure are so appealing to them and they love the music! It is so refreshing as a parent to have something that we all like and that is not based on a TV show or movie.",1126828800,5,432,3.7472527472527473
