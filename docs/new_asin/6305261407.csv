7886181,5,6305261407,"This is the third Crying Freeman movie that I've seen, and of the three that were made, this one is by far the best! It's not as well made as the 1995 film, but it is excellent in it's own right! Out of the three movies, this one does stray the farthest from it's source material, but it still holds many similarities, enough to make fans happy. The fact that every character's name was changed(Yo Hinamoura/Freeman being renamed Jeffery Yo), the setting in England, Yo killing for revenge rather than against his will, and Yo's past as an artist being thrown out, make this film fell more like it used the original story to build it's own narrative, and it works perfectly. The switch from Japan to England is also great! This is also the only Crying Freeman movie to have the ultra-violence of the manga and OVA. This film is extremely violent and filled tons of blood, but the good thing is that while the manga and OVA's overused gore was just overused gore, the gore and violence in this film actually give off a darker and unsettling feel rather than it just being there for the heck of it, which is a good thing, as most films just use gore just for the sake of it instead of using it to add to the film's atmosphere. The soundtrack is also excellent and very atmospheric, immersing you in the world of the film. The English dub isn't even that bad(for the most part), but it would have been nice to have an option for the original language. All in all, this is a great overlooked classic! While it has some shaky camera work at the beginning, the fight scenes are excellently choreographed and unlike films today, the guns actually look like real guns when being fired, and it does a great job playing into it's source material. This is a fantastic watch for Crying Freeman and action fans! Don's miss out on this unheard of classic!",1398556800,,1841,4.465875370919881

 ""This movie is great. Simon Yam delivers a great performance as an adopted chinese son of a japanese yakuza leader. The chinese triads and the japanese yakuza are battling for control in Britain's chinatown. When his father is killed, he goes on a killing spree, killing anyone who may have had anything to do with his father's death. One day when killing a triad leader, he is caught on camera by a girl(Joey Wong). Instead of killing her, he falls in love with her. At the end, Yam kills all the baddies,finding that the main villian is his trusted underboss. The movie has some great looking scenes, some capturing the very essence of the animated cartoon, Crying Freeman, which this film was based on. The gunplay in the film is very good, as well as the swordplay. The fights(courtesy of Phillip Kao)are first rate, very hard hitting, and well choreographed"".
The DVD version is pretty much the same as the VHS version as far as picture quality, perhaps a little clearer since it is a DVD and you don't have to deal with any typical VHS image interference of any kind. It is the same exact version as far dubbing, cut, and format. The movie stands the test of time and I still enjoy watching it on occasion.",1362873600,,1372,4.554655870445344
7886183,2,6305261407,"First of all, this is a reasonably strong film.  Not that you'd know it watching this DVD.  If you are lucky enough to find the letterboxed/subtitled video, rent or buy it.
Simon Yam puts on a very strong performance as the head of a crime family whom is is forced by circumstance to take a hands on approach to eliminating the competition.
By no means a groundbreaker by way of plot, and definately not Yam's finest hour as an actor but it does have some finely choreographed violence, including a noteworthy kendo match in which Yam administers a savage and breathtaking beating to one of his lackeys during a sparring match.
A reasonably grimey and aggresive low budget gangster film in its original form, this DVD's production reduces it to a laughable mess at times.
