8579155,3,B00CABAF98,"Jang Man Ok, is a feisty, tomboy hapkido instructor who lives with her grandfather. But what she really likes is fashion. When her grandfather is away on a trip for several months, she just happens to become the stylist for the popular idol group ""Take One."" (Later called, ""Take Two."") Lee Tae Ik and Won Kang Hwi are the two good-looking guys that make up the group. The two have very different personalities and are always arguing. One is very organized, serious, and a perfectionist. The other is cute, easy-going, and friendly. As Man Ok gets to know the two, a love triangle begins. This causes many surprises and problems for the three.

This drama was alright. The story line and characters were okay, nothing too special. I actually thought some of the clothing and hair styles didn't look good and even looked out of date. Enough that I actually found it distracting at times. Through more than the first half of this drama it looks like the main actress is wearing a wig that also makes her look much older than what she is. (It was just her odd hairstyle though.)

The characters were somewhat likable, but it wasn't like other shows where I just love the characters and can't get enough of them. Although I'm somewhat disappointed with this drama, it's not all bad, I did give it 3 stars after all. There are some good romantic and funny moments mixed in with surprises and unexpected twists and turns. This is a drama that I would probably not watch again. Once was good enough. I think my favorite episodes were the first two or three. The music in the drama is really good though. (32 episodes that are about 30-some minutes each) (This drama isn't related to the other Korean drama, ""Full House."" It's an entirely different show.)",1388448000,,1747,4.632258064516129
