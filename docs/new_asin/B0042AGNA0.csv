8573340,4,B0042AGNA0,"I bought this DVD to help me prepare for job interviews.  It's not over-the-top dramatic, it has a lot of positive spins and goes into depth of professional short-comings (such as losing your job) and how one individual overcame those problems and improved upon his life.",1403481600,,271,4.891304347826087
8573341,5,B0042AGNA0,"I loved this one so much, I ordered the whole set.

The only critique I have for the producers is to not have the logo and test in-between every little snipit of advice.

I know why you did it... you wanted 50 YouTube videos... but you could have cleaned up that stuff for the DVD.",1361664000,,281,4.090909090909091
8573342,5,B0042AGNA0,"This DVD is quite amazing and well done. I've shown it to several coaches and players and they all love Coach Payton and the way he delivers the messages. I feel it's important to defend against another review I saw here. i think the reviewer really misses the whole point and design of these DVDs and frankly I'm guessing the reviewer is probably out of touch with ""pop culture"" and the most effective way to get messages across to todays consumer. The production is actually a big part of why I really enjoyed the DVDs. The messages are delivered and produced in a very powerful and visceral way. They are delivered in succinct/contained 1 and 2 minute increments. i would much prefer this to a long ""lecture"" type delivery while a coach is sitting at a desk or on some stage in a hotel conference room. The music, editing and actual NFL footage provide an extra layer of impact. They are also indexed in a way that I can find exactly the type of message I need when I need it versus trying to scroll through one long speech.

And as far as the originality of each coaches message-not sure where to start-every coach talked about so many different subjects in a way I have never heard before. Do you really think legendary coaches like these would just go on camera and read ""cliches""??? They all speak from the heart and in their own unique context based on ""THEIR INDIVIDUAL"" life experiences.

And by the way-I visited the Victor 1 site and noticed that Adam Schefter from ESPN and Michael Lombardi from NFL Network raved about the DVDS-as any football fan knows, these two guys are the real experts.

All in all pretty good stuff and I really enjoyed the product.",1291766400,,1669,4.538205980066445
8573343,4,B0042AGNA0,"This is a very difficult review to write. It is difficult because the message contained in GET COACHED by Sean Payton is well worth hearing and if I were basing this review solely on message content, it would garner 5 stars.

I bought the entire GET COACHED set with very high expectations. When it comes to motivation, I believe sports coaches are some of the very best at it. I hold the late college basketball coach John Wooden in the highest regard and have handed out numerous books of his to clients, employees and friends. Some of the best and most inspiring speeches I have heard were delivered by coaches. So it was with great anticipation that I waited for this set of DVD's to arrive.

As with all of the DVD's in this set, the message Coach Sean Payton delivers is fantastic and should be heard be everyone. The problem is, anyone who has ever read just about any book on self improvement has heard every bit of this before. I watched this video intently 3 times and the forth time took detailed notes and still struggled to find even some semblance of a quote I had not heard before.

My biggest complaint, however, is with the overall production of the series. The viewer is given a brief segment of what might be termed a motivational ""one-liner"", then the camera breaks away to what becomes a very annoying graphic reminding you this is COACH PAYTON, brought to you by VICTOR 1.

The entire thing would have been much better, much more effective, and much less annoying if they simply had the coach standing in front of a group or even sitting at his desk talking to the viewer and not subject the viewer to the endless message breaks.

I do want to add specifically on the Coach Payton DVD, after viewing all of the DVD's in this set, the Coach Payton DVD is probably my favorite.",1291334400,,1797,4.483180428134556
8573344,5,B0042AGNA0,"This great video in the new ""Get Coached"" series is one of the best yet- Champion coach Sean Payton breaking it off like it really is!  I'm not one for new age stuff like ""life coaching"" but this presentation was in a manner I could understand it and pumped me up!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1289865600,,285,4.3584905660377355
