1849266,5,B00008K78A,"This wonderful film, on the cover entitled  , ""Mivtsah Yonathan"", which actually is Hebrew for ""Operation Jonathan"", and is affectionately named (as was ""Operation Thunderbolt"" itself) for Yoni Netanyahu, brother of the later prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu.  Yoni was the only soldier-fatality on the mission.  Even though pricey, this film was well worth every penny spent.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.  I echo all of the other comments in support of buying this film.  Although I enjoyed also ""Raid on Entebbe"", the American version of the same events with an all-star cast, I enjoyed this one more.  Very exciting, very true to life, and very interesting.  I remember the actual events, even though being ten at the time, but was quite aware, even at that age, of what was happening in the world.  The movie is very accurate as to what actually happened.  The film is mainly in Hebrew and English, although there is also some German, Arabic, and French, but subtitles are supplied.  Definitely, purchase this film!",1256083200,4,1036,4.965116279069767

Don't expect the Hollywood version.  Expect to be awe struck by the planning and execution of this mission.  BB Netanyahu's brother was a great man.  It is only ashame that we had to lose even 1 Israeli life, and it was his.",1217894400,12,378,4.194444444444445
1849269,5,B00008K78A,"This is an awesome movie. You have to read the subtitles but it is the closest movie, by far, to what really happened. It bothered me to see Yoni die at the end, even though I knew it was going to happen. Yoni was the driving force of this mission and he didn't get to see the finished product. A great man was lost that day, but this was his goal, to see those people rescued, no matter what. 101 people are alive due to this daring rescue. Just shows everyone the guts that Israel had and has",1207612800,47,494,4.051020408163265

1849271,4,B00008K78A,"I had noticed the movie ""Operation Thunderbolt"" because it was nominated for Best Oscar for Foreign Language Film the year it came out.  I've noticed that category was usually a good source of worthwhile fims I might otherwise miss completely.  This movie fits the bill although I'm not sure it fits the category since it's 90% in English.  It tells the compelling tale of the raid on Entebbe and is an Israeli production which has its' advantages and disadvantages.  The advantage is in knowing who the ""good guys"" are, probable access to inside information, and an enthusiasm that Hollywood would have missed.  The disadvantages are some questionable casting, a ""Made-for-TV"" soundtrack, about 15 minutes of film that should have been left on the cutting room floor.

I found the quality of this used video tape to be a bit less than what I had hoped for.  I only mention that because I see so many reviews that focus almost exclusively on the quality of the media.  After the opening cast and credits, I stopped noticing the slight blurriness.  The movie spends just a slight amount of time developing the characters at the beginning.  Before we know it, the plane is in the air and the terrorists take control.  Some of the actors are good, some are very good, and some are...well, let's just say that the liner notes tell how 12 of the hostages play themselves.  I counted more than 12 that seemed to ""fit"" that category (if you know what I mean).  Along that line, we are treated to a number of disappointing actual scenes of Israeli leaders ""in action"" during the time the hostage crisis was taking place.  We see them sitting in chairs, walking down hallways and looking at phones.  (Obviously, I couldn't seem to realize anything positive about their inclusion).

Technical points aside, the movie moves along at a reasonable clip (when not showing the politicians at ""work"") and the suspense is well-developed.  Those who know nothing of this historical event should enjoy just about every non-Knesset minute of the film.  Those who are aware of the event (and may have seen other movie versions of it) will still find it an engrossing film.  It is, of course, a very timely movie 30 years after it was made given the international state of affairs that we are in.  Not much has changed in that time (especially for Israel) and there is a sense that the Israeli's, out of necessity if for no other reason, are the experts on dealing with terrorism.  We Americans could learn a few things from the Israeli's and this movie (although not their rather inept response to the Hezballah in Lebanon last year) is evidence of that.

I'm glad I bought this movie.  It is one I will watch again because it tells a sincere version of what was a most impressive act of anti-terrorism.",1181260800,,2782,4.714285714285714
1849272,4,B00008K78A,"This movie, a much better adaptation then the garbage flick put out by Hollywood, ""Rescue at Entebbe"", is very true to the tactics, techniques, and training of a counter-terrorism unit.  If you want slick action, smooth lines, excellent special effects, and brilliant camera work this movie is not for you.  If you want the presentation of an actual event as supported by the participants, many of whom gave their advice and recollections to the making of this movie (one of whom is now the IDF Chief of Staff); complete with the impact on the families of those who went into harms way, then you will find this movie of great interest.

  It boiled down to this: when Jews were held hostage and faced with death it was only the Jews (Israelis) who came to their rescue.  The fact that when the doors were kicked in and the dogs were taken down the memorable phrase is, ""They're ours!""

  When the mission is over, and the hostages returned, you see joy and celebration, and the cost to the families who lost their loved ones.  You also see the heroes coming off the plane and heading off to their next assignment.

  Historical Note: Yonaton is buried in Jerusalem, next to him is the grave of the General who sent him on the mission.  Israeli soldiers are buried in the order they die.  Benyamin Netanyahu, his brother, eventually became Prime Minister of Israel, after commanding the same commando unit.",1170979200,35,1405,4.677551020408163
1849273,5,B00008K78A,"Operation Thunderbolt(1977) is one of several films done about Israel's handling of the 1976 hijacking of an Air France jet by terrorists who thought they had a slam dunk when they landed the plane in Entebbe,Uganda,then ruled by dictator and mass murderer Idi Amin. This is the Israeli version and it includes footage of Israel's leaders,apparently during the crisis.

While 'm(Unich)' apparently ""humanizes terrorists""  who murdered Israel's '72 Olympic athletes,this film looks at the hijackers as scum .While I really didn't think of this as a masterpiece when I first saw it,lb. for lb.,I now do. Klaus Kinski is always a badass bad guy,Mark Heath as Idi Amin and Yehoram Gaon as Jonathan Netanyahu,the leader of the mission are terrific;Netanyahu was Israel's only soldier who died during the operation-and if Spielberg is considering making a movie about Entebbe,hopefully he'll quit while ahead and not turn Yoni

into some kind of ""Avner"" character. But since 'Unich' had already been done with the very forgettable 'Sword Of Gideon'(1986),possibly what's needed for 'Entebbe' is a director who knows what he's doing,for example,John Woo-director of Chow Yun Fat movies. Until then hopefully 'Operation Thunderbolt' will be considered a masterpiece.",1137024000,4,1258,5.441025641025641
1849274,5,B00008K78A,"In 1976, Palestinian and German terrorists hijacked an Air France flight and forced it to land in the African town of Entebbe, where they were welcomed and protected by Uganda's then-dictator, Idi Amin. Releasing all the non-Israeli passengers, the terrorists threatened to kill the rest unless dozens of their comrades were released from Israeli prisons. Rather than submit to blackmail, the Israeli army secretly flew thousands of miles to Entebbe and freed more than 100 hostages in a daring nighttime raid to the cheers of most of the world.

""Operation Thunderbolt,"" now available on DVD, was filmed in Israel with the full cooperation of the Israeli government, and is an exciting re-creation of the events of those tense days.  We see the full scope of the story, from the original hijacking to the passengers' captivity in Uganda to the agonized debates at the highest levels of the Israeli government over a diplomatic vs. a military solution.

All the characters speak their own languages, so the film is a linguistic hodgepodge of Hebrew, Arabic, German and English; fortunately, the DVD includes subtitles. It also contains a documentary on the real events surrounding the rescue, which is almost as compelling as the film itself.

""Operation Thunderbolt"" is the thrilling and true story of how one small country refused to let their people be killed by terrorists and took action to prevent it. People who claim that Israel is a ""terrorist state"" should see the film and be reminded who the real terrorists are.",1091232000,121,1524,5.059760956175299
1849293,4,B00008K78A,"Entebbe, Uganda, 4-July-1976: The GREATEST anti-terrorist Commando-raid of the 1970s!

A combined operation of terrorists hijacked an Air France flight on 27-June-1976. This criminal action was commited by the ""Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine"" and radical-leftist/communists of ""Red Cell"" from West Germany. Their demands: to free their fellow terrorists currently incarcerated in Israel.

The flight, enroute to Jerusalem, was diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, where the terrorists received aid and shelter from the murderous dictator Idi Amin. Of the 260 passengers, all the Israelis were segregated to be systematically murdered if the demands were not met. The non-Israelis were allowed early repatriation.

A visually lavish portrayal of the events, Operation Thunderbolt tells the story of one of the most spectacular and ingenious rescue-operations ever attempted by an anti-terrorist unit, the Sayaret Matkal!

Although 260 hostages were ultimately saved, sadly, there were casualties. Three passengers were accidentally killed by gun-fire during the raid. An elderly lady, Dora Bloch, was murdered by agents of the Ugandan government as she lay helpless in a nearby hospital. Yonatan Netanyahu, the commander of the raid, was hit by enemy fire, and died on the flight home to Israel. This review is dedicated to them!

God Bless you Yonatan!",1333584000,,1359,5.642156862745098
1849294,5,B00008K78A,"Operation Thunderbolt is a great movie about the Israeli hostage rescue mission at Entebbe Aiport in Uganda. It is a well made movie made in Israel about the tragic events leading to and including this rescue mission in late June / eraly July of 1976.

What I like about this movie is that the actors speak in their own native languages, so you can hear Hebrew, English, French and Arabian.

I would also like to thank seller Adam for not wasting any time. I placed my order on 12-17-11 and today ( 12-22-11 ) it was right there in my mailbox.",1324512000,,543,4.366336633663367

1849298,1,B00008K78A,"After reading the several positive reviews of the film, I expected something rather good.  Instead, I watched a very amateurish production with only two accomplished actors, Klaus Kinski, who is here lacking in dimension, but does rather well playing the Klaus Kinski evil person that we expect from him; and the Israeli actress who, I believe, later played the mother in the Tom Hanks romance, Every Time We Say Goodbye. (Sorry, I don't know her name.)  The rest of the cast appears to be in some sort of really weak acting class mode, with strong, noble expressions on the good guys (the Israeli commandos), strong, concerned expressions on the Israeli politicians, and frightened, worried expressions on the hostages.  There's no depth or complexity here, just two dimensional good and evil.  It quite possible that much of this is the director's fault.  Actors  for the most part have to do what the director specifies, and sometimes what appears to be weak acting is, in fact odd directing. On the other hand, perhaps the cleverest bit in the whole film is the director's  having the captives run from place to place which effectively brings image matches with some of the nasty Nazi films of the the way Jews, Poles, and Gypsies (among others) were herded around in the death camps.

Then there is the matter of weak production values, e.g., sound effects that begin, stop, and then start again (think aircraft engines).

The raid on Entebbe is something that any nation can be proud of.  It was mission fraught with great peril that was brought off successfully.  It's just a pity that all of the films based on the event are so weak.

By the way, the VHS tape version I bought from one of Amazon's sellers had no  subtitles at all. I don't know if this is normal or an anomaly. I could have used them with both the German speakers and the Israelis speaking English.",1277251200,2,1873,4.726153846153847
1849299,5,B00008K78A,"After watching this splendid film recently for the second time, I can now say it is one of my all time favorites.

1849302,5,B00008K78A,"OPERATION THUNDERBOLT (Hebrew: MIVTSA YONATAN) is Menachem Golan's and Yoram Globus's film recreation of the daring Israeli rescue of the hijacked passengers of Air France flight 139, bound from Jerusalem to Paris, which took place on July 4, 1976, America's Bicentennial.

Hijacked by a combined force of Arab and German terrorists who claimed to be ""freedom fighters,"" the 85 Jewish passengers plus the flight crew were segregated and flown to Entebbe, Uganda's capital, where they were held under threat of death and with the smirking acquiescence of Idi Amin, the mad dictatorial President of that country.

The Israelis came up with an ingenious rescue plan which involved flying an anti-terrorist team a thousand miles and more to Entebbe, raiding the terminal, and extracting the passengers. It went off about as perfectly as it could. Three passengers were killed and 5 wounded during the rescue. One, Dora Bloch, who had been separated from the others by dint of being taken to the hospital, simply disappeared, presumably murdered. All the terrorists were slain. Only one Israeli soldier, Yoni Netanyahu, (older brother of the future Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu) was lost.

This was a moment of pride for all decent and truly freedom-loving people in the world.

There were several Hollywood versions of the event, but this one, made in Israel, had the backing and cooperation of the Israeli government. Yitzhak Rabin, Yigael Allon, and Shimon Peres all appear as themselves. Sybil Danning (""The Queen of The B's"") appears as ""Halima"" (in real life the terrorist Brigitte Kuhlmann.

7984990,4,B00008K78A,"I have a number of Entebbe films in the waiting area, but wanted to watch this one first.

I defer to those who say we were there re:  the realism of this film to the actual events.

While Israeli politicians gave their OK to include news footage in the movie (I liked the intercuts of the real politicos), I noticed the IDF didn't have any official role.  From a ""war film geek"" perspective, it seemed to have the right feel for the planning, rehearsal and execution of the raid itself.  Don't expect slick/flashy like one might with American treatment of things military.

The feel of the film is that of the era:  very 70's, with music verging on the feel of ""blaxspoitation"" in some parts.

The film is not perfect:  at least one accidental appearance of a boom mike in the shot, and some of the long shots of the hijacked plane were of a 707 instead of an Airbus.  In spite of these niggles, it's a good watch - a welcome addition to my war flick collection.
