530542,5,630300279X,"In FEAR IN THE NIGHT, a woman named Peggy Hiller (the ultra-lovely Judy Geeson) is recovering from a nervous breakdown. She finds herself stalked and attacked by a one-armed man. Of course, no one believes her due to her fragile mental state. After moving back in w/ her husband -at a boys school- Peggy meets Michael, the school's headmaster (Peter Cushing), who has a very familiar disability! Soon, she is attacked again. FITN is a wicked little mystery / thriller from Hammer studios that kept me guessing. Joan Collins (TALES FROM THE CRYPT, TALES THAT WITNESS MADNESS, EMPIRE OF THE ANTS) plays one of the best roles I've ever seen her in as Michael's wife, Molly. Superb...",1379203200,,680,4.82051282051282
530543,3,630300279X,"As a fan and collector of all Universal and Hammer mystery horror movies especially Peter Cushing who I have almost everything
he ever did so I finally found this on VHS. Cushing has a minor role as Ralph Bates and Judy Gelson both two great actors have
the main roles. I found for a Hammer production the movie is kind of slow and takes a while to get going even Cushing doesn't
appear for about 30 minutes and Collins even longer. I watched once and didn't care for it much but after a 2nd and 3rd viewing
I found it much more entertaining but it's more of a mystery movie than a horror movie. Of course with all Hammer movies the
acting, directing and writing are excellent but It's not as good as Scream of Fear or Nightmare or Paranoiac all great thrillers.
But if your a Cushing, Bates, Gelson or Hammer fan then you will want this in your collection. But not for $124 DVD! get the VHS!",1374278400,,892,4.284023668639053
530544,4,630300279X,"In this atmospheric thriller, Judy Geeson [of ""To Sir With Love""] plays Peggy, a pretty young woman, newly married and anticipating a blissful married life with her new husband, Robert [Ralph Bates]. A couple of days before she leaves, she gets attacked by a one-armed attacker, but neither her landlady nor doctor take her seriously because Peggy apparently suffered a nervous breakdown a couple of months ago. She reluctantly sets the incident aside and moves to the country where Robert is a schoolteacher at a boarding school run by sinister headmaster Carmichael [played to perfection by Peter Cushing]. Joan Collins plays Cushing's wife, in a brief but significant role. Before long, Peggy gets attacked again and again, and wonders if her sanity is truly going or if more sinister forces are at work.

I loved this movie, partly because of Cushing's and Geeson's credible acting, despite a rather tepid script. They shine on screen and bring depth to their characters. Mostly though, I loved the sinister atmosphere created by the secluded and empty boarding school [presumably because its summer]. Oh, and there's a nice little twist in the end too. Final verdict - high on atmosphere, this is a decent thriller with the talented Mr Cushing. And the DVD quality is crystal clear with great sound.",1253491200,,1304,5.037037037037037
530545,4,630300279X,"""Fear in the Night"" (1974) is a quaint psychological thriller/mystery from Hammer Productions.  It is much in the vein of their earlier ""Scream of Fear"" (1961), which was also directed by Jimmy Sangster.  Both films involve the psychological torment of a pretty young woman who is already on the brink of a nervous breakdown.

  In ""Fear of the Night,"" Peggy (Judy Geeson of ""Doomwatch"") is attacked by someone who wears black and has an artificial arm.  The next day, she moves with her teacher husband Robert (Ralph Bates of Hammer's ""Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde"" and ""The Horror of Frankenstein"") to a boys' private school in the secluded country.  The mentally disturbed Peggy soon learns that the headmaster (Hammer horror icon Peter Cushing who starred in the Frankenstein and Dracula series) has an artificial arm.

  A gloomy, atmospheric horror masterpiece, ""Fear of the Night"" boasted an excellent cast that also included international superstar Joan Collins (Alexis of ""Dynasty"").  She is quite superb as the headmaster's evil, cruel, conniving wife Molly; she makes Alexis look like a Catholic num.  Geeson, I must add, does a wonderful job portraying the emotionally confused Peggy who keeps insisting the attacks are not in her imagination.  She is frustrated and angered by Robert's refusal to believe her.

  ""Fear in the Night"" is highly recommended for fans of Hammer films, especially the psychological thrillers that mimicked ""Psycho"" such as:  ""Paranoiac,"" ""Scream of Fear,"" and ""Nightmare.""  You'll want to watch ""Fear in the Night"" if you are a big fan of Joan Collins and/or Peter Cushing.  They also starred in ""Tales of the Crypt"" from Amicus Productions.",1234224000,,1680,5.155555555555556
530546,2,630300279X,This Film could have been so much more if it had just had more of a script. I watched it a second time to confirm my belief that never in any one scene are all FOUR of the leads together. In fact there never is more than three people in a shot at the same time. However it isn't too bloody and Peter Cushing is quite good in his roll as Headmaster. But neither him or Joan Collins live up to the acting they gave us in Tales from the Crypt.,1196726400,,440,3.8461538461538463
530547,3,630300279X,"Hammer referred to them as ""mini-Hitchcock's"". Fear in the Night is the last in a series of fine thrillers Hammer made during their long successful run. Director/writer Jimmy Sangster (screenwriter on Horror of Dracula, Curse and Revenge of Frankenstein among many others)creates a fine atmospheric thriller.
The story centers around a young woman (Judi Geeson) who has recently had a nervous break down and a one armed man that may or may not be still stalking her. Her husband (Ralph Bates) is given a post at a new boy's school. The stalkings continue and she suspects at one point that the headmaster (nicely played by Peter Cushing in a glorified cameo)may have something to do with all that's going on. Joan Collins also appears as the flirty headmaster's wife.
Adapted from a script that Sangster had sold to Universal years before, Fear in the Night has been seldom seen since its initial release in 1972. While it isn't the best thriller produced by Hammer, it recaptures some of the studio's more atmospheric productions from the early to mid-60's. The cinematography is evocative and helps create both the mood and tension of the piece. While Hammer puttered on for a number of years after Fear in the Night was produced, it was truly the last strong production from the studio. When it was released it was paired with another thriller Straight On Till Morning and the double bill failed to find an audience. Shortly after its release, Jimmy Sangster and Hammer severed their long partnership. It's a pity as Fear is an intelligent suspense thriller the type that Hollywood has forgotten how to produce.
The DVD transfer is crisp althought I found the colors to be a little washed out. Given the stock used and the time when the film was produced, it's not that much of a surprise. Still, the print is clean and in almost prisitine condition all things considered.
The DVD also has a running commentary by writer/director Jimmy Sangster that is most enlightening. He provides both the context within which the film was produced at Hammer and a good overview as to why it may have failed to find an audience. Given that it came out around the same time as Hitch's brutal Frenzy, it probably suffered in comparison.",1054425600,11,2224,4.824607329842932
530548,4,630300279X,"Judy Geeson (""TO SIR, WITH LOVE"") is a newly married young woman who keeps getting attacked by a one-armed man and nobody believes her, probably because she just had a nervous breakdown. She and her hubby (RALPH BATES) move into a cottage at the country school where he is a teacher and more attacks occur. This is a well cast, well writen thriller and one of Hammer's better film's of the 70's. Geeson is very good as the jumpy heroine as is Peter Cushing as the odd headmaster of the school. Joan Collins (pregnant at the time) is also good as Cushing's wife in a small role. I liked the creepy atmosphere of the empty ""school"" and found the story and it's surprise ending very satisfying. The DVD is the usual fine disc I've come to expect from ANCHOR BAY. The anamorphic widescreen picture is crystal clear and the sound is very pleasing. A trailer, audio commentary with writer/producer/director Jimmy Sangster and liner notes are the extra's. If your looking for a fine, old-fashioned thriller, this is it. Highly recommended! Enjoy! -George Bauch.",1051660800,22,1054,4.7650273224043715

530550,3,630300279X,"This is one of those early 70's thrillers, you always think could've been just a little bit better. The dialogue is dull and repetitive, but there are some good things, too. -A nice eerie and spooky tension, so typical for  its day. (Something completely lacking in modern-day thrillers; more  interested in entertaining their audience with action as stand-in for  atmosphere.) The cast is another plus. Now, a movie featuring Peter  Cushing, Ralph Bates and Judy Geeson can't be all that bad. -And it isn't,  but one still can't help thinking, that a tiny bit more action would've  been welcome in this case. The cast just isn't given much to do, especially  the brilliant Bates. -No wonder he wanted out of the genre, making this his  last film for ""Hammer"".

530628,2,630300279X,"This movie typifies why I don't usually watch dramas from the 1960s and 1970s. It is so simplistic it isn't even young adult level, more middle school. You could see every move a mile away. Comedies and musicals from that era are at least amusing. This was painful to watch. And it didn't even feature fashions or interior decor from the era. The main character is a poor, dowdy housewife who wore clothes that looked like she bought them in the equivalent of the K-Mart of the era. The headmaster's wife looked a little better but not much. And OMG the amount of time spent panning through the various rooms of the school! I got the feeling they'd paid a fortune to use the school and by golly they were going to get their money's worth. There were some nice interiors but they were antique, not mid-century modern. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was the presence of a fairly young Peter Cushing.

Bottom line: The title of the review says it all.",1464220800,,968,4.438202247191011

530681,2,630300279X,"I found Arthur Grant's lighting the principal annoying element of this motion picture. It is true that while Jack Asher photographed almost all of Hammer Film classics, Grant was usually in charge of the less ambitious projects of the company. By the end of the 1960s he contributed to little gems as ""The Reptile"" and ""Plague of the Zombies"", but even these were much brighter than the average horror film and --in cases as ""Frankenstein Created Women"" and this production-- the lighting was more akin to a television drama or sitcom, having too much light on sets of dark tales, making the images (and the tales) look flat. Then the almost absence of surprise and subtlety in the dosage of information, does not help the fact that the story-line is not very original, and that you have seen it many times before, and a couple of times with more flair. Judy Geeson, Ralph Bates, Joan Collins and Peter Cushing do quite well, considering they are dealing with stereotypes (frightened girl, suspicious husband, bitchy headmaster's wife, and mean crippled headmaster, respectively) and that they were under the direction of Jimmy Sangster, who was foremost a very good scriptwriter. But do not expect too much. 2.5",1462838400,,1212,4.946078431372549
