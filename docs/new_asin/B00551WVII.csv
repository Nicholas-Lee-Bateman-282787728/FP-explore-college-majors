8457232,3,B00551WVII,"The film also goes by the title ""High School Hitch Hikers"" which makes as much sense as the girls are neither in school, nor are they hitch hiking. They are two young girls who are traveling. They come across what they believe is an unoccupied house, so they (Gilda Arancio, Jolle Coeur) enter and turn down the bed. A man shows up and they show him a good time. When the lady of the house shows up, she discovers the diamonds are missing from the safe. The girls are hunted down and can only be questioned and tortured without clothes....I think you get the idea.

Not a very well made film. Plot holes. But the girls are pretty.
