3667381,2,B001KP2J2G,"A hodgepodge story with wayward and silly plot points.  Rachel McAdams is a doll, but Michael Pea may be the worst actor working today.",1235865600,,135,4.625
3667382,5,B001KP2J2G,"Great, great, great movie that makes all the right choices and seems to have been totally unappreciated by critics for the classic it is.  The characters are so real in this one that by the end you don't want to leave them anymore than they wish to leave each other thoughout.  I thought the script was excellent and gives each actor their moments to shine.  It's unfortunate but I'm sure there will be some flag-wavers who won't want to view soldiers as real human beings, with their own doubts and fears, and will want to judge them as ""disloyal"" at times.  That totally misses the point of this movie since all 3 eventually make their way back to Iraq.  The movie shows just how complicated the war has made it for average Americans to feel about what is or what isn't patriotic.  But more than the war story, this movie has great chemistry going for it and if you're like me you'll be swept up in this dramatic comedy that at times can be laugh out loud funny.  Enjoy it with some friends.",1235520000,,993,4.39344262295082
3667383,5,B001KP2J2G,"Amazon.com recapped the plot ably if less than enthusiastically, so I'll just jump to the praise.  A truly fantastic movie!  Intelligent, hilarious, touching, surprising, thoughtful, wonderfully performed, even suspensful.  Superlatives do not do this movie justice because each one demands it's own exclamation when instead they are all woven together into the seemless and harmonic beauty that is this film's quiet grandeur.  And don't forget it's very funny.  So do yourself a great favor and see a movie with characters you will not want to leave, or leave each other.  Thanks, and have a nice evening.",1234742400,28,606,5.260416666666667
3667384,5,B001KP2J2G,"I was drawn to this movie because of the cast.  I think Michael Pina and Rachel McAdams are two of the brightest young stars, and Tim Robbins contributes an excellent supporting role.  Funny, sad, and thought- provoking are words that immediately come to mind when describing this movie.  A small group of soldiers unknown to one another meet and come together to provide support and empathy as each struggles with a personal tragedy related to the war in Iraq.  The ending leaves one hoping for more, but life and the decisions one makes are forever consequential.  This is not a war move, but explores the consequences of war.",1223942400,,628,4.777777777777778
3667405,1,B001KP2J2G,fakest dumbest military movie ever. don't waste your time. love all the actors in this but they just completely bombed their roles. poorly done.,1502841600,,144,5.041666666666667
3667406,1,B001KP2J2G,"No, no, no, and a hundred times no.  Love Rachel McAdams, but she butchered her role.  As a female soldier it was so disgusting to watch the lack of depth and understanding that she brought to her part.  When you've actually been through all the crap in military life it changes your soul, your sense of humor, what things set you off and what things roll off your back, and these characteristics were sorely missing.  There was another movie recently free on Prime about medic out of Fort Bliss, and while it was still made for tv or wtvr, it at least did its part in capturing some mental and emotional struggles.  The Lucky Ones must of had a producers who got together as many cliches and stereotypes one could find on Pinterest as to appeal to the general public who don't really know what today's military is like and mixed in 100+ coincidences that were so pathetic you end up feeling robbed of brain cells trying to imagine that this film was made in earnest??

3667408,2,B001KP2J2G,"This movie does not rate more than 3 stars. The weak link in the movie is Rachel McAdams who was either given terrible lines, or delivered the lines she was given terribly, or maybe she is just that bad of an actress. Trying to believe this simple minded girl was even in the army is impossible to imagine by the end of the movie. On the plus side she is a cute girl. Tim Robbins and Michael Pena give good performances and really make the movie tolerable and believable. It is worth a watch if your running out of other material to keep you entertained.",1502409600,,554,4.285714285714286

3667440,5,B001KP2J2G,"This movie was awesome.  I found no flaw, and I couldn't stop watching.  You become fully invested in this story.  And it opened my eyes to something new.  I did 2 years, drafted in the Marine Corps in the '60's, and still this movie taught me something.  Something more than the stress syndrome working on these 3.  No, I as a kid 19 years old, just an empty head, but I saw at the end of this movie when these 3 are back in uniform and assembling to fly back over to a war zone, and we see them too in that large group of others at the departure point, all of them going back.  And that long, long line of them crossing the tarmac headed to board the plane, and you realize that these people, every one of them.... ALL of them have stories similar in effect and complexity, of hopes and even desperations, as what we just saw in this story.  And here they all are, trudging back out to a military plane, and back over the sea.

We tend to think of the people opting to go off to the army and other branches of service, as if they were going off to serve overseas as starry-eyed kids, out on their own and eager to experience life and all that it might bring.  But that's superficial; that barely grazes the surface of those people.  When viewed in light of the 3 soldiers whom we just followed in this story, a simple story of 30 days leave but so full in meaning, that we sense there are unknown stories of great depth in all of that group of returning men and women0; there is a very real underlying mishmash of complex things going on inside each of them, which has brought them to this point...  variations of the same hopes and dreams and plans made and plans dissolved that we just witnessed. We see them all now gathering, waiting in line to board a military transport.  That really hit home with some impact.  They go for reasons none of us can know, and those reasons may include a sense of feeling trapped into it, difficulties with family situations and relationships in trouble, and so here then is at least ONE option, an almost a desperate one, that many or maybe all of them are making.  Each of these men and women hold a story of their own, that has led them now to make that walk across the tarmac to a waiting plane, the result of how many desperate choices?",1500422400,2,2279,4.243055555555555
3667441,3,B001KP2J2G,"Although I enjoyed this film, I felt it was much too long and plodding.  Good acting, but I didn't like Robbins cast in this role - not only because I think he's a terrible actor, but also due to his personal political stance.  It seemed hypocritical and insulting to have him as part of the military.  The writing was mediocre and disappointing.  Overall, it was a good effort.",1500336000,,378,4.514705882352941

3667443,5,B001KP2J2G,"I have a genre of films I call ""charming""; and this film is a great example.  Good people who care about their friends and make their own families amongst those nearest and dearest to them.  There is a deep and abiding trust and respect among military people that does not usually exist in the civilian world.  I guess when the quality of one's work ""really"" matters in a life-and-death way, the petty posing that so often takes the place of true progress falls to the side and we refocus on things that really matter in life.  That's when our friends can give us that little nudge that motivates us off the fence.  You'll enjoy this film.  Cheers!",1500249600,3,648,4.495726495726496

3667468,5,B001KP2J2G,"""The Lucky Ones"" is a timely story of three soldiers,and the problems they encounter, returning home after a tour in Afghanistan The story is excellently constructed and is brought to life by the exceptional talents of Rachel McAdams, Tim Robbins and Michael Pena.  This is one of the best movies of the year.

3667471,1,B001KP2J2G,"This is a foul-mouthed and disgusting movie-  I'm really shocked it has earned 4 stars here. I wanted to like this movie for 2 reasons: 1. Parts of it were filmed in my home town and 2. We love Rachel McAdams. Boy, were we disappointed. Before I move on to a synopsis (without giving away the ending) let me state that Rachel McAdams was either a terrible actor in this movie (based on the very shallow character she played) or a great actor who was able to step out of her usual character and play this person (similar to what Sandra Bullock did in ""All about Steve."").
So here is how this brick of a movie flows: One of the main characters (Tim Robbins) is featured in Iraq riding in a humvee with his squad. They are having a discussion about the female genital area and how to please a woman sexually. They hit a mine and shrapnel hits the poor sergeant in his private area leaving him unable to ""get it up."" He decides to take a trip to Vegas to meet up with some ""professional women"" who can help him rectifiy his problem so he can please his girlfriend. He meets up with 2 other veterans who are going back to the states for R&R (or retirement in the the case of the senior member of the ensemble). The F word (along with the SH-- word) are thrown around in every discussion by all 3 members. Even the cutesie Rachel McAdams uses it regularly and it, and her fists, fly often. Along the way, they attend a party and the character played by Michael Pena has a one night stand that almost ends up in a three-some when the husband walks in (or was it planned?).  The movie makers want you to connect and have sympathy for these 3 war wounded (mentally and physically) veterans but the way they are presented kept me from feeling sorry for them. Anyway, if this sounds like your kind of movie - shallow, profane, and focused on sex and body parts, then enjoy. Otherwise, avoid this ""bomb"" (pun intended.)",1441497600,2,1907,4.338935574229692

""The Lucky Ones"" (2008) is a true hidden gem.  I wasn't expecting much when I put the DVD in my player but before too long I knew I had stumbled on to something great.

THE PLOT: Three soldiers coming back from Iraq meet at JFK in NY where all flights are delayed due to a blackout. One soldier is older and getting out of the Army for good (Timothy Robbins), one has a serious groin injury and is trying to heal-up (Michael Pena) and the other is on leave to visit the family of a dead comrade (Rachel McAdams). They end up in a rental vehicle traveling across the country where they experience many sides of American culture and each other's deepest secrets, hopes and pains.

All three stars have great chemistry and Rachel McAdams (who I've never seen in a movie before) is a total revelation as Colee. Although Colee isn't highly educated she's not dumb. In fact, she excels socially and is the catalyst to hope and healing for the other two. A more beautiful, spunky, stimulating woman could hardly be found!

Both Timothy Robbins as Cheaver and Michael Pena as TK shine in their roles as well. Cheaver becomes the necessary father-figure in the trio and the others become increasingly concerned about the well-being of their temporary ""dad.""

The film features a good balance of Eastern and Western locations, shot in Illinois, Missouri, Colorado and Las Vegas.

FINAL WORD: I don't want to say anymore. If what I said perks your interest, be sure to check out ""The Lucky Ones.""

This is why I watch movies...not to see the latest technology and explosions(though I admit I do like that stuff when it's done well)...but to find small indie flicks that are really really good...I'm not gonna tell you about this movie, you can read other reviews here. What I will tell you is that it'a a road movie that is really really good...and Rachel McAdams is pretty hot in this ;)",1329955200,,448,4.475609756097561
3667523,3,B001KP2J2G,"Very predictable, not very original plot line.  I don't know if I saw Robbins smile once in the whole movie.  A bit depressing, perhaps a bit too realistic, to be entertaining. Must be in a very mellow mood to finish this one.

 I could not decide if this movie was propaganda FOR the Army or against the Army.  Basically 3 soldiers are sent home after serving overseas, only to find their lives have fallen apart in their absences, (which we see thru a series of stops on a road trip).  So they decide the only ppl they have left is each other, and end up re-inlisting the army.

Thats basically the whole movie.  The end shot is of their plane lifting off into the sky filled with soldiers.  I get that it could be  saying, ""we are the army, we can be like family to you""...But for each of them to lose their real lives just for the military is depressing to me.

The message that we are all human and can find solace in one another, family or not, is the only good point of the movie.",1318204800,,987,4.196808510638298

This definitely did not do anything for the acting abilities of McAdams and Pena.",1301529600,,342,4.444444444444445
3667525,3,B001KP2J2G,"The Lucky Ones was a great idea for a film. A road movie about three soldiers on leave, played my Rachel McAdams, Tim Robbins and Michael Pena. When these three soldiers - who are initially strangers - end up on a plane together (and eventually a rental car due to the grounding of planes) they're forced to spend time together, limping and driving across the country, battle scars everywhere.

Directed by Neil Burger, known mostly for 2006's decent enough The Illusionist, The Lucky Ones feels like the work of a filmmaker who has ended up far out of his league. He seems to make some good decisions here and there (the film is well cast and the concept is strong), but, for a $14 million dollar film with three great leads, The Lucky Ones is a major disappointment. For starters, cinematographer Declan Quinn (In America, Rachel Getting Married, Leaving Las Vegas, Monsoon Wedding, etc.) doesn't give this film a $14 million dollar look. In fact, after a few scenes I got excited, thinking that this might be a true indie film with a tiny budget. It's not. And, unless Burger paid his stars big bucks, I can't figure out where the $14 million went - there's nothing in this film that should've cost much more than a Joe Swanberg or Andrew Bujalski film.

And while that might seem like a petty complaint (seeing as how most movie watchers don't analyze such things), let me also take this opportunity to point out how sad it is to see Burger, who also wrote the film, piss away a great story idea. Three unconnected modern day soldiers end up stuck in a car together, crossing the country? How can you mess that up?! Especially when you have McAdams, Robbins, Pena and Quinn on your team? Burger finds a way.

All that said, there are some enjoyable moments in this pedestrian piece of film art. Whenever the trio pass any sort of landmark or tourist trap, McAdams' character begs to stop, the other two denying her. They three all wake up at night with night terrors. We even get to see the endlessly soft-and-sweet McAdams start a fight at a college bar in southern Indiana where she's eventually backed up by her new solider pals. It could've been a classic moment. Unfortunately, it's not memorable and hardly believable, no matter how convincingly muscular McAdams' jaw and shoulders are. Robbins' and Pena's performances are strong throughout and McAdams' face continues to be the best screen face of her time. But, aside from these minor points, The Lucky Ones is a disappointment. Soldiers are, by average, living the most storyteller-worthy lives of any Americans right now, and this is all Berger can come up with? A bar fight and night terrors? Needless to say, this isn't a very deep or thoughtful film.

And the use of music? Damn. Berger offers a selection of super obvious hipster picks mixed in with a score so cheesy that you have to doubt the vision of the director. F'real; it's that bad.

I could go on, but why bother. Burger, who with The Illusionist became a director to watch, has become, with The Lucky Ones, a director who is going to have to fight for jobs, stars and production budgets. The classic case of an overhyped auteur blowing their big break.",1300147200,,3182,4.664884135472371
3667526,5,B001KP2J2G,"I am honestly REALLY surprised so few people have apparently heard of the Lucky Ones. This is how a drama film with a light touch of comedy *should* be created. Take notes all you aspiring film makers!

It's about three soldiers that all happen to have their flight cancelled, so they end up driving in a vehicle together and eventually they become good friends. They go on the adventure of a lifetime as they travel across the country, meet several different people along the way, and get involved in many different life-changing experiences.

What's amazing about the Lucky Ones is, without a doubt, the brilliant storytelling. This is seriously one of the most memorable and interesting stories I've seen in a movie in a REALLY long time. I totally enjoyed it from beginning to end. It's easy to follow, exciting, and just highly underrated when you realize how many other films have gotten more attention than this one has.

The one soldier -the female- was REALLY funny. I was totally laughing hard at every singel sexual related joke she made towards the other soldier (that she gradually became good friends with). The oldest soldier of the bunch probably had the worst luck of the three considering all the stuff he finds out about his family when he returns home.  Luckily he has two friends that help get his life back together.

The Lucky Ones also does a really good job showing what it's like going through life from a soldiers point of view.  You see scenes showing their wounds they suffered while fighting, and you see the occasional nightmare segments as well.  These are frequent problems involving soldiers who return home from war.  Good detail there.

This is just a simple story about three soldiers who have the time of their lives while spending a lot of time together. The storyline is AMAZINGLY good, the acting skills are rock solid, and the overall film is highly recommended. The only negative is a certain tornado scene near the end. The tornado itself looks incredibly tacky, but other than that, I have nothing but really great things to say about the Lucky Ones.",1279497600,,2095,4.781163434903047
3667527,3,B001KP2J2G,"While there are some disassociations with reality and home life for those stationed overseas in war, three returning wounded soldiers must objectively view their fortune when their home lives begin to dissolve around them.  T.K. (Michael Pena), a leader returning to his fiance in a precarious situation; Cheaver (Tim Robbins), an old veteran who is bidding adieu to his Army career but facing a home life that is potentially more volatile than war; and Colee (Rachel McAdams), a nave but fresh-faced Private returning a loved one's heirloom to his family while dragging around her bum leg.

This wonderful tale of three soldiers sharing time on a cross-country road trip moves a bit slowly, but the realism, character development, and impeccable acting helps the pacing move along a bit.  Friendship among the three appears to be real, and their bond forms quickly as they learn about one another's life and troubles.  Charming chemistry is tough to come by; yet the camaraderie among these three returning soldiers feels genuine.

Much like Home of the Brave, there are some unfortunate clichs holding back the script.  Not all soldiers sleep in their PTs, all soldiers coming home from war do not have PTSD, and despite what Hollywood would have us believe, they don't resort to violence as a first response to difficult situations when they have difficulties fitting into ""normal"" society.  It's just a slanted view of troubled soldiers that gives the impression of people who are different from the rest of us, and I wish there were more movies that showed similarities instead of perceived differences.  Our society has evolved quite a bit since the post-Vietnam days.  I hate to say it, but I suspect this paragraph has something to do with Tim Robbins' politics.  Thankfully, Robbins doesn't let his beliefs get in the way too much, and the majority of the film rightfully shows detractors of the military as close-minded idiots.

Despite the mixed politics and predictable ending, the majority of the movie is full of humor and humanity.  Subtle inertia seems to drive the characters' decisions, creating a heart-warming rendering of their time together.  Finding the positive side of one's misfortunes is what truly makes the beginnings of a hero; it's the ability to get back up after life has knocked you down.  I recommend this film for those tired of the typical plot-less CGI-lovefest being regurgitated by contemporary Hollywood shills.",1278115200,2,2452,5.0975
3667528,3,B001KP2J2G,"The previews looked good and I couldn't argue the cast so I figured to give this a shot. This isn't a bad movie by any means, but given everything, it should have been better.

I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he's always had a knack for picking nifty, quirkyish kinds of projects, so I was surprised at how pedestrian this was. He does do a better than decent job with the material. I like Rachel McAdams enough but something in her performance here is pushing her to the next level. I'm now thinking she might be someone to keep an eye on. Michael Pena does an OK job. Not bad but not as outstanding as his co-cast members.

This is essentially a road trip flick where our 3 heroes come back to the states from the Mid-East (2 are on a 30 day leave with Robbins having finished his tour) and get weather-stranded at the airport. They share the cost of a rental to Robbins' house from which Pena and McAdams will grab flights to their respective destinations. Things go south for Robbins in the form of family troubles and now the 3 will continue west where their bond deepens.

The trouble here lies in the script. Their bonding commitment to each other happens way too quickly for my money. There isn't really anything that happens to show why they would treat each other like something other than casual acquaintances. Maybe there is something in the ""band of brothers"" sticktoitiveness I don't get but it simply didn't feel right to me. There were also some scenes that I found no place for. A particular scene involving a sudden desert rainstorm seemed to have little purpose other than to settle another aspect of the plot which could have been done in a much more organic fashion. And there seemed to be a need for the writer to resolve everyone's story, even if not in a conventional Hollywoodish type way. Life is messy and things don't always work out.

What I did like was the natural look of things. This was shot to look only slightly better than a home movie which did give the sense of seeing something more real. The music score was decent enough as was the editing. There just seemed to be a forced quality to it all. I felt the writer's hand on virtually everything that went on.

This is not a bad movie and I could easily nudge my review up another half star, but don't expect too much from it. You may very well be disappointed.",1269216000,,2359,4.426267281105991

I returned from Viet Nam in 1969 and can relate to the feelings expressed in this film.  So many people at home ""didn't get it"" and would say the very same insensitive remarks depicted in this film.

3667532,5,B001KP2J2G,"It isn't well known but some 50,000 vets died during the V/N war; but a tragic 50,000 more died after coming home. Back then you didn't see the honoring of veterans you do today. I am proud to be a part of the movement to push for the honoring of all who serve in combat. A brief scene in the movie features a couple of saps who are against the war. To these soldiers' honor, they silently tolerated the awkward, outdated foolishness of those characters...except for Rachel who had to(ahem) ""take care"" of a couple of snotty girls in the bar.
One of the reasons so many V/N vets died after coming home from the war, were the movies that characterized veterans as grotesque charicatures, that led ultimately to V/N Vets chronic unemployment, and marital failure. That was wrong. The producers and directors of those lies became millionaires at the expense of veterans a thousand times more honorable, who are now dead - while the director owns his own vineyard. Isn't that special?

Anyone who has served in the military, especially in a combat zone, or a family member of one will love this film. The script qualifies as 'literary', the acting, absolutely flawless. It's a simple story. Two soldiers each with a wound on 30 day home leave; and Tim Robbins who is also injured, but is mustering out. The story, though slow by 'action hero' standards...no flying, hurtling autos landing in fiery crashes...is nevertheless a ""page turner"". You can't leave the story for a minute. You have to see what happens next. This is good writing, acting, directing, and filming. We get to know each one of them very intimately. We hurt when they hurt, we laugh when they laugh, we cry when they cry, we exalt when they exalt. The term 'simple story' just does not do this film justice. It is far deeper than you would think. it will last as one of the great movies. True art , it has been said, is when a particular age, a specific culture is reflected and frozen in time for all of us to look back on in a hundred years and understand completely what 'that era was about'. Congratulations to all involved in this bona fide masterpiece of contemporary cinema. My hat is off, and I bow to Tim, Michael, and Rachel and the writers who gave us a believable story about three real people, ordinary people like you and I, who just happen to be courageous and selfless enough to leave their lives behind for this nation.

3667534,5,B001KP2J2G,"""The Lucky Ones"" shows that a great movie can be made on a shoestring, without car explosions or special effects or any whizbangery.

All it takes is terrific acting, moving characters, great writing, and appropriate (often spectacular, sometimes grimy) scenery.

This one is the story of three soldiers, on leave from Iraq for wounds, who meet and share a ride--then share much more.  They become emotionally close, even spiritually intimate, all the moreso because the civilian worlds they are returning to crumble around them like fading dreams.

 Colee (Rachel McAdams) is the youngest, most innocent: wide-eyed, eager, happy, frank, unashamed, friendly, loving, open to anything.  She is the forever-child--who learns, but never loses her innocent wonder, no matter how many shocks she endures.

She provides the catalyst for Cheever (Tim Robbins), the old timer who is looking forward to being DONE with the army and war, but whose world collapses and who, the others fear, has reached suicide; and for T.K. (Michael Pena), the young hotshot who has life all figured out, ready for his climb to the top--until nothing works.

It's Colee who points out the wonderful beauty of life they are passing through--which the other two almost miss, and who indicates how they can start over.

The ending is terribly sad and uplifting and scary and hopeless all at once.

There are many ""war"" movies, and they are pretty much all the same.

While the actors are quite wonderful, something about it didn't quite ring true for me and there was nothing whatsoever original about it.  There are borderline ridiculous many comedic scenes, but the tone is more serious than not.  You can't have frolicsome tragedy.  McAdams is far too beautiful to be a normal grunt and Robbins' personal crisis is too predictable and conventional.  Pena, I thought, was the best:  a tightly wound guy who slowly started to fall apart later on.  I also liked the presence of the killed boyfriend, who is a very real and evolving character thru the film.  Unfortunately, I was kind of waiting for it to end.

My wife and I love finding independent films that deserve more attention. With a stellar cast, we wanted to see where ""The Lucky Ones"" would take us.

This isn't a perfect film, and it doesn't work on every level, but the three performances alone make it a joy to watch. All three play Iraqi vets on the way back home, two for leave, one for good. All three have been wounded. All three have deeper issues than the marks on their outer bodies. Thrown together by flight cancellations, they drive cross country and discover more about each other and themselves in the process.

The film makes some subtle observations about society, though the insensitivity of some college students seemed a little much--maybe I've just never met such idiots. McAdams, as always, is likeable and easy to empathize with. Pena, despite one reviewer's distaste for him, is a very fine actor--compare his neurotic, hard-edged side here to the soft-hearted guy in ""Crash."" And Tim Robbins shows some real depth without overdoing it.

The ending is not as predictable as it might seem halfway through.

All three of them have been wounded while on active duty and are sent back home for 30 day rest.  Upon arrival to NYC airport their flights are canceled due to prolonged power outage and the three decide to share a rental car ride on their cross country treck to their respective homes.

During their trip from east coast to the west they learn about each other's lives, how they were wounded and try to figure out their next move after 30 day leave is over.  The unexpected realities of the civilian life sends them a curveball that they try to resolve.  In spite of being relative strangers, all three are protective of each other in every possible sense.  Many of their adventures are humorous, but the end of their stories is definitely suprising.

I absolutely loved this movie and I recommend it to everyone.  It will give one a perspective on what makes people choose to become soldiers, what keeps them going and what keeps bringing them back to their duty.  It also shows the other side of the story on how little civilians really understand about military experience and how at times, civilans can be disrespectful even if they mean well.",1240444800,,1308,4.701754385964913

It is a comedy that makes light of personal tragedies and does it gracefully. I watched it in a 'combi pack' with 'Stop Loss', the much more serious film about soldiers who are forced to return to the front after their contracted term has expired.

In The Lucky Ones, Robbins is a sergeant who has completed his term and who looks forward to return to wife and teenage son. Pena and McAdams are on a 30 days home leave. The three get accidentally grouped together for a car trip from New York to Las Vegas and experience the difficulties of outsiders in an ambiguous situation. None of them has stable social circumstances, as even the Robbins character finds out to his shock. Their social backgrounds are quite divergent. They are variously feted as war heroes or attacked by the home crowd for being either too stupid to stay away from trouble or too luke warm about the war effort itself. The backseat drivers in middle American require heroic attitudes, not a statement that survival is a soldier's main objective.

3667554,5,B001KP2J2G,"This movie does have its classic road trip moments, but when all is said and done it's a lot deeper than most of the road trip movies I've seen. And it's hilarious, often in the most surprising and creative ways. Colee, T.K. and Cheever are three soldiers coming home on leave, with not only very different backgrounds but very different goals. They travel together for convenience at first, but soon form a close attachment as they experience twists and turns on their journey that turn their expectations upside down.

What's great about this movie is that although it could have been overly political, it isn't. It's not about the war in Iraq, it's about how the war has changed the personal lives of these individual soldiers. They encounter Americans that either deeply respect them or scorn them, and seeing things from their perspective, you see that though the scorn hurts, it is not because they approve of the war, but because the effect of the war on them is more of a personal issue rather than a political issue. They have lived it, and whether other people support the war or not, they have just tried to survive it. They are thinking more of how to pick up the pieces in their lives on their leave, and deal with the personal damage that any war can inflict on a soldier's life.

The actors are all excellent and well-cast. Tim Robbins is believable as a humble man who just wants to do right by his family. Michael Pena is perfect as a proud, sometimes cocky young man who faces insecurity (for a pretty funny reason, although you definitely feel for him). But Rachel McAdams in particular really shines in this movie. I think this is probably the most complex role she's ever had, and she does a great job playing Colee, a spunky girl who provides a lot of comic relief on the trip, but at the same time is struggling with extreme loneliness.

At its core, this movie is about three people who find companionship and help each other work through life-changing problems. It's touching and convincing at the same time, and I think it could appeal to anyone. All in all, a great film.",1236643200,,2098,4.589333333333333

Pleasant enough buddy road movie.  The girl seemed most beievable.  But, they were all good.  Robbins as the lifer seems less likely.  Kind of mellow.  Not at all walk-the-chalk.

Script has a few amusing moments; nothing hilarious.  Ending soft of fizzles.  But, relaxing to watch after hard week at work.",1504224000,,381,4.723076923076923
