Stardate: 1512.2
While on a star charting mission, the Enterprise encounters a luminescent, radioactive cube. When Kirk is forced to destroy it, an enormous ship of pulsating light appears, commanded by the ominous Balok (Clint Howard). Balok condemns the Enterprise crew to death, and seeing no escape, Kirk chances a desperate bluff. Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy debuts in this episode and the beloved triad of Kirk's leadership, Spock's logic, and McCoy's humanity is now complete.

The Man Trap
Stardate: 1531.1
When the Enterprise's landing party arrives on planet M113 to give a routine medical examination to Robert and Nancy Crater, a nightmare unfolds when several members die, every trace of salt mysteriously removed from their bodies. Since McCoy was once deeply in love with Nancy, he's especially concerned for her safety. However, the real Nancy Crater is already dead; a being has taken her form and needs salt to survive. Because Crater's supply is gone, it has only one source - the crew of the Enterprise.
