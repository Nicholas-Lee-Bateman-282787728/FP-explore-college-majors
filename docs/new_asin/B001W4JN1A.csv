8346957,3,B001W4JN1A,"Frederic Schoendoerffer's French gangster movie Truands aka Paris Lockdown may not have much plot but, unlike his catastrophically dull and inert (if such a word could be used about a film mostly comprised of scenes of people walking) Agents Secrets, there's enough incident to compliment the ambiance. With its philosophising limited to the odd line like ""To dodge a bullet you hold the gun,"" there's a satisfyingly unsentimental approach to its pragmatic criminal antiheroes, the violence brutal but the torture scenes not dwelled upon - the aim of the criminals is to get their message across as quickly as well as as painfully as possible. The emphasis on efficiency over grandstanding extends to the film's biggest setpiece, a well-staged but not too over the top shootout in a parking lot marred only by not knowing who is doing what to whom.

Olivier Marchal, ex-cop turned actor-director (36 Quai des Orfevres, MR 73) has the perfect face for a professional villain, which is enough to offset leading man Benoit's Magimel's occasionally unfortunate resemblance to British comedian Paul Whitehouse here, but the standouts in the cast are Philippe Caubere's crimelord whose arrest causes a dangerous power vacuum and Tomer Sisley's small-timer who's come out of jail with religion and a burning desire to stick it to the old school. It's not a great film and breaks no new ground, but it covers it pretty well, and there's a nice throwaway in-joke where one character watches one of the director's father's films, La 317&egrave;me Section.

The UK PAL DVD boasts a decent subtitled 2.35:1 widescreen transfer and includes a lengthy 52-minute documentary on the making of the film and the UK and international trailers for the film.",1284940800,,1737,5.112676056338028
8346958,2,B001W4JN1A,"As a lover of French gangster films, I suppose that I have been spoilt by the Gallic masterpieces of the past with films like Rififi, Bob le Flambour, Touchez par au Grisbi and Le Cercle Rouge. I live in hope that one day I will see a French crime film which matchs up to these classics, the way that Goodfellas and Casino compaire with the classic American Film Noirs of the forties and fifties. So far films like La Balance and 36 Quai des Orfevres have come close but do not quite make it.

I watched Paris Lockdown in the hope that this was the one. I was disapointed, Paris Lockdown has graphic violence by the bucketfull in order to get accross it's point that these men are violent. We know they are violent, they are gangsters, we do not need to be shown it every five minutes.

Compaire this blood drenched film with Touchez par au Grisbi, we know that Riton is a man not to mess with by the simple way he slips a gun into his belt.

What ultimatly lets this film down however is that you cannot identify with any of the main figures. In the classics, Max (Grisbi), Toni (Rififi) and Bob (Bob le Flambour) may have been violent criminals but they had a code. There were lines they did not cross and above all they were loyal to their friends. In Paris Lockdown nobody is loyal to anything except themshelves. One gangsters says he does not mind killing his friend because another gangster asked him first. Paris Lockdown may I suppose be a truer portrait of the French underworld than the romanitised classics from the fifties and sixties, but it does not make better cinema.

If you judge your films on the amount of violence and sex, and in this film most of the sex is violent, then this is for you. If you want something with a bit more style then go back to Rififi, Grisbi etc.",1251158400,,1791,4.3532934131736525
