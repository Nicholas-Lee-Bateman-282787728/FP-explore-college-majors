7602962,5,B01AJ7ELT4,"A compelling examination into the dark side of human nature. The desire to try to explain WHY this tragedy occurred has led to many interpretations on film. Think ""Compulsion"", ""Rope"", ""Murder by Numbers"", etc.",1457827200,2,210,5.205882352941177

7602964,1,B01AJ7ELT4,"Boring and a very tragic story of two very confused young men. I believe if your going to make a documentary, then it should be interesting. A precious little life lost by the hands of two horrendous cowards who wetent even worth the effort of making a movie.",1456876800,7,259,4.416666666666667
7602965,4,B01AJ7ELT4,"I remember learning about the famous murder trial of 19-year olds Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb in my college law classes YEARS ago (the 1960s) but I learned a lot more in this 55 minute episode of PBSs American Experience series.  This was a case where the two young men in Chicago (both from wealthy aristocratic families) brutally murdered (and even threw lye on the genitals of) a 14 year old boy, on a whim  and then plead Guilty. Their parents hired the well-known anti-death-penalty lawyer Clarence Darrow to have their death sentence overturned.

I don't like spoilers (as you will know if you read my other reviews) and the film  using lots of archival still photos with commentary by a writer, a historian and a playwright  with narration by actor Oliver Platt  is best enjoyed without knowing much more.

I would have liked to have known more about public reaction and subsequent events after the verdict (which I won't divulge) is handed down. And, thats why it gets 4, rather than 5, stars from me.

The DVD has no additional bonus features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7602969,3,B01AJ7ELT4,"An interesting presentation of  a sensational, senseless murder on the 1920's. The historical precedent was minimized over giving a modern perspective on the murder and subsequent trial. The glaring omission on the entire documentary was the absolute lack of any mention on who the victim was (other than being a cousin), or the effect it had on his family. They call into question the prevailing outlook and evolution of the death penalty, but I think at some point they should really question the whole concept of what a ""life sentence"" actually means, and they ignored this completely.",1525996800,,588,5.061855670103093

7602973,5,B01AJ7ELT4,This was one of the best documentaries that I have ever watched on PBS and Prime. It is so well done and carefully put together. It left me feeling like I was alive in 1924 as I watched the case unfold. Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in quality crime mysteries and psychology.,1504569600,,293,4.444444444444445
7602974,5,B01AJ7ELT4,"plot: Docudrama fact based look at the lives and crimes of Leopold and Loeb.

Two boys are both wealthy and have a very good education. Both enter college in their early teens. They also are highly intelligent are drawn to each other and become best friends. As they complete crime such as theft they grow in following of Nietzche. They believe their idol/Neitzche has convinced they were ""supermen"" and that made them above the law. They plot *the perfect crime* complete with how to and when and what do with the body. The victim is a random young man who is murdered and tossed naked in a drain. Their staged crime is complete except for the alibis. A letter the police find in Loeb's home leads the police to believe the boys are lovers. and the made up/ ""perfect alibi"" was they went looking for two girls for sex does not hold up. As the police break the alibis and soon the boys turn on each other the world is shocked by the grizzly murder and the two boys who show no remorse what so ever. Clarence Darrow one of the most re guarded lawyers of his time pleads them guilty and fights a life sentence in prison. This is a look at life and law in the 1930s. It is very well done and keeps you watching. This gets you inside the boys lives and responses to crime. 5 STARS all the way also watch Compulsion a drama movie based on this event.",1503705600,4,1345,4.2952755905511815
7602975,3,B01AJ7ELT4,"Frankly, I found this to be more about Clarence Darrow and less about the heinous crime itself. I was disappointed that very little was mentioned of what the prosecutor said to counter Darrow's marathon. It would have presented a more balanced picture of the battle of the State vs. Darrow (never mind the two monsters who committed this unspeakable crime). I would think that the prosecutor would have attempted to steer the trial back to the victim after Darrow presented his emotional recitation, and provide a description of exactly who the young boy was and how he suffered. But this documentary gives no hint of what strategy was attempted to counter the great orator. I must look elsewhere for that information as little attempt was made here to try and give us some idea of what was said to present the case for sentencing Leopold and Loeb to the gallows.

At any rate, a great miscarriage of justice happened on the day these privileged, spoiled brats (for want of a better word) received life instead of the hangman's noose. After so much evidence from the ""alienists"", the judge in effect tossed all of that out because he could not bring himself to send boys so young to the gallows. How absurd.  These were young men who knew exactly what they were doing.  It seemed the judge didn't want to be the first to sentence what would have been the youngest murderers to be executed by the State. What he did was set a dangerous precedent, one which meant that others in that age group could follow in their footsteps, assured that they would not lose their lives regardless of the heinous crimes they might commit.

I also felt that this documentary did not provide enough information of the victim, his life, and the horrors suffered by his parents. What did they think of the verdict? You won't learn that from this program. But what it does show is how all too often a victim becomes lost as attention is focused so much on the accused that we forget this was but a ten-year-old child who suffered a horrible death.  Victims become just faceless names and this alone is enough to aid all too often in a miscarriage of justice. Alas, not much has changed in this regard.

All in all, it was a decent story but not a riveting one. Perhaps I expected too much. But there were instances where the almost constant emphasis on Clarence Darrow began to grow tedious. I would recommend it, but don't expect a balanced accounting of the trial.",1499126400,8,2444,4.619815668202765
7602976,3,B01AJ7ELT4,"This documentary seems to be a bit more about the great Clarence Darrow than the two criminals or their victim. It would have been nice to get a bit more background on the victim, Bobby Franks, as well as a bit more about the planning of the murder, etc. They did add a bit more about their personalities and their relationship than other documentaries I've seen, however. Also, what does the playwright have to do with anything? Other than that, this documentary is a reasonably good summation of what transpired with the Leopold and Loeb case.",1495756800,3,545,4.6875
7602977,4,B01AJ7ELT4,"Wow!! I am not so much shocked that they are young. it's the idea that the rich and privileged don't know how better to spend their time, money and privilege but torture, murder...It's significant that part of their defense is that they were raised by their nannies thus making them emotional stunted. I think that contributes now to our kids. There are more parents working outside of the home, that the nurture that they should be receiving, the growth that they should be guided into healthily, comes from someone getting paid to do so. An faade of a relationship, a value that holds little meaning for some, unlike that with which they have from the parents that gave birth to them...a relationship that most kids, then or now, can very much see through.",1488672000,,758,4.706766917293233
7602978,5,B01AJ7ELT4,"The real life Alfred Hitchcock ""The Rope"". Also similar to ""Murder by Numbers"" with Ryan Gosling. Great docu!",1486598400,,109,5.111111111111111
7602979,4,B01AJ7ELT4,"This was a facinating documentary. One of the few I missed. A family member said it was good, and it was. I found it better than most others of this genre, being well produced. This hit almost every newspaper and radio broadcast across the country. It was Big News.
This is a story about a cold blooded, indicriminate, child's murder, but without the unneccesary gore, not allowed at that time, as is in our times.

Delving into the the relationship of these two young peoples lives and their (psychological, mental) thinking, thoughts, both separate and together, for the understanding of this terrible crime, was complex to say the least. It was, as the title suggest, (almost) a perfect crime, except for the surprising and simple slip-up clue that rushing egos sometimes commit.
They were both raised by nannies, and both developed abandonment issues. They both had advantage in life, and so did notdid not fit the profile (of expertise at the time). One suffered more than the other, and their intimate relationship, described as homoseual and deviant, itself was deemed complex, as one was the ""master"" and the other his ""slave"".
Well worth the time to watch it.",1485820800,2,1168,4.898989898989899

7603108,5,B01AJ7ELT4,Love PBS SHOWS,1474329600,,14,4.0
7603109,4,B01AJ7ELT4,"PBS American Experience revisits the 1924 case of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, two scions of wealthy Chicago Jewish families who inspired by Nietzsche's discourse exhorting life beyond good and evil at the University of Chicago, decided to prove themselves ubermenschen by committing an utterly senseless yet perfect crime. The pair plotted the act for months, then chose a victim at random - a 14 year old boy named Bobby Franks who was Loeb's second cousin. They bludgeoned him to death with a pick ax, disfigured his corpse with acid, then dumped him in a culvert. Loeb accidentally left a pair of unusual glasses at the scene, which police traced back to him. The two were interrogated at length, and confessed in detail.

Their families, terrified at the prospect of them getting the death penalty, hired Clarence Darrow - of Scopes Monkey Trial fame. Darrow was an anti-capital punishment campaigner who defended clients in over 100 capital murder cases.. Only one ever got the death penalty - his very first. Darrow took the ""Leopold and Loeb"" case due to the massive press coverage, seeking to use it as a platform to push for the abolition of the penalty.

The crime itself is really not the main focus here. The true thrust of the film is the case's implications. Because the evidence was overwhelming for the prosecution, Darrow entered a guilty plea and then called psychiatric and other authoritative scientific witnesses in the sentencing phase to build a case that the two were not culpable due to their inherent medical flaws and emotionally impoverished and traumatic upbringings. They were not evil, only stunted and malconditioned, and so did not deserve to die.

This case, akin to the the Scope's Trial, was another platform for Darrow to advance the secularist view that human beings are in fact in a B.F. Skinnerian sense morally ""beyond good and evil,"" and that our behavior can only be understood through the prism of biology, sociological circumstance and psychological conditioning. Any idea that we consciously choose evil is mythological: scientifically speaking evil does not exist as a moral/ontological category since we cannot - do not - in fact choose anything.

This is Darrow, from his 12 hour long summation:

""This terrible crime was inherent in his organism, and it came from some ancestor... Is any blame attached because somebody took Nietzsche's philosophy seriously and fashioned his life upon it?... It is hardly fair to hang a 19-year-old boy for the philosophy that was taught him at the university.""

Darrow's entire speech is interesting, and can be found excerpted at length elsewhere online. This film only summarizes his defense, which can be characterized as high oratory. The commentators in the film say that mercy was Darrow's definitive value. Whether that be the case, the prosecutor was no William Jennings Bryan.. He didn't stand a chance.

The judge - who was the sole arbiter in the case as no jury had been empaneled due the guilty plea - was not impressed by all the medical testimony. He sentenced them to life for the murder plus 99 years for the kidnapping, saying he based the verdict not on testimony but precedent. The two were only 19, and no one younger than 23 had ever been executed by the State of Illinois.

Loeb was later murdered by a cellmate with a knife in 1936. Leopold served 33 years, and was finally released in 1958. The footage of the press conference he gave on his release is some of the most interesting footage in this film. He had been a model prisoner, mastering a couple dozen foreign languages, teaching, revamping prison study curriculums, working in prison hospitals, even volunteering for a malaria study in which he was deliberately infected by the disease.. Upon his parole he looked more like a respectable bank president than a convict. He went on to live in Puerto Rico for the rest of his life, where he married a florist, obtained a masters degree and taught at university, published medical studies and a book on ornithology.. Amongst many other things. He died in 1971 at the age of 66, a free man.

Crime. Punishment. Good. Evil. This film and case are interesting grist for a mediation upon all of it.  Recommended.",1474329600,4,4227,4.907563025210084

7603168,3,B01AJ7ELT4,"In May 1924 when the victim's body was discovered Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were 18 and 19 yrs old. It made no sense why the two young men age 18 and 19 were constantly referred to as ""boys"" throughout the narration of the film. If these were ""boys"" then what were those soldiers in WW1 7yrs earlier? Even in the trailer, the lady interviewed calls them ""children"" of privilege. What an insult to the family of the victim even today! The victim was 14yrs old. Not a boy yet not a man by anyone's definition. Really, I'm appalled. As for the rest of the film quality, it is okay from the purely filming point of view but not as good as some programs on ID channel. Honestly, if the title were changed to not be so misleading with such high expectations going in that direction I might have liked it better.",1473206400,4,811,4.342105263157895

7603369,4,B01AJ7ELT4,"I've always been fascinated by this story since first reading about it years ago, for the same reasons as most of society at that time, so I was already pretty familiar with the case. What I liked most about this documentary was the number of personal photos included - most of which I'd never seen - video footage, scenes from the courtroom, the ""murder map"" & photos of them following along to each scene of the crime, parts of Darrow's bold filibustering, the and actual shots of the newspaper coverage. What's interesting is how you would most likely underestimate him at first glance because he seemed to not care how he looked when out in public, but his defense was almost pure genius. I actually can't be angry with him over his defense, because when you hear ""money is no object"", then anyone who is driven by money and who doesn't like to ever lose will pull out all the stops. I was more angry with the judge for basing his decision purely on age. That was stupid, IMO, because he overlooked the facts that these monsters killed an innocent child (Loeb's own cousin!) simply to prove that their superior intellect would keep them from being caught, and that they actually sat & laughed during court proceedings as if it were all a joke, signifying that they never cared before, during, or after the crime. They should have been hanged. It's no wonder the public speculated that the judge was also paid for getting them off. I can believe that.

I thought this documentary did a fairly good job of telling the story while providing great visuals. The only things I would've changed: Loeb's death was tossed in like an afterthought, told only in 1 sentence; none of their prison life was mentioned or included, especially the fact that they were able to continue their relationship inside (they should've been in apart!); Leopold's life after prison wasn't covered.",1470528000,2,1874,4.713414634146342
7603370,4,B01AJ7ELT4,"I first heard about this case while reading a book on the crimes that inspired the play (and later the musical and movie) ""Chicago,"" as all they happened in the same year, in the same city and made Americans question the direction of society during the roaring twenties. My interest was piqued and I'm glad it was. Though this documentary feels a big short and I would have liked more depth, it serves as a good, solid introduction to the case if you've never learned much about it before. The case is fascinating for how ahead of his time the defense attorney, 67-year-old Clarence Darrow, was and how strangely the accused parties acted. The production is good quality and uses photos and a bit of footage from the era, instead of reenactments, which I appreciated.",1470268800,10,767,4.688888888888889

7603419,5,B01AJ7ELT4,"For those of you crime and legal history buffs, this is an amazing documentary on one of the most heinous crimes of the 20th century. It is the story of two young,  rich and intelligent men, Nathan Leopold and Richarf Loeb who perpetrated an almost perfect crime of cold blooded murder for the thrill of it. The film depicts in great detail an attempt to explain how and why they committed the crime. The film explores the evidence presented in trial, defended by the infamous criminal defense attorney, Clarence Darrow, who introduced for the first time in court cases, unprecedented evidence by expert witnesses on the plea of insanity.

7603508,5,B01AJ7ELT4,It seems we were more civilized years ago. Today everybody is old enough to die but not old enough for much else. I like how they showed these people from long ago and how they grappled with the merits of executing two teen age men. I guess the debate will go on for years. This movie shows how it happened years ago and what they struggled with. The idea that teaching people to not kill people by killing people that may have & propably have & may never have & probably haven't killed people is more dysfunctional then some of the homicides they are prosecuting for. I'm disturbed how it's socially acceptable to excite people AND I'm disurbed how easy it is to let a convicted/confessed murderer go free after 33 years on a sentence of life+99yrs. I think this documentary really shows both sides of this barbaric system and how elusive justice is on either side. It also shows that  privilege doesn't mean healthy or optimum environment for raising children and it does imply the pricelessness of a caring loving home for a child.,1469145600,4,1034,4.589189189189189

7603521,4,B01AJ7ELT4,"I read the story of the Leopold and Loeb murder case in my teens and was intrigued by it. I wondered why two highly educated men would commit a senseless crime for thrills. They thought they could commit the perfect murder, but made a mistake and got caught and were sent to prison. Loeb was killed in prison and Leopold got out after serving or wasting thirty- eight years of his life locked up. This case tells us that crimes are not committed by just low income and uneducated people, but by the so-called rich and powerful who feel they are above the law. Human nature has not changed after all these centuries. Society is blamed for creating criminals and the death penalty is rejected as punishment. This story has a strong Shakespearean theme to it. Shakespear's criminals are in power and do whatever they want. Clarance Darrow blamed society for the crime committed byLopold and Loeb.  But in Julius Caesar, Cassius tells Brutus, ""the fault dear Brutus lies not in our stars, but in ourselves'. Don't blame me for what criminals do.

7603526,4,B01AJ7ELT4,"Loeb and Leopold commit a murder without any rational explanation.  This signals a new type of criminal.  One in which two young boys, much like anyone except for being extremely privileged, commit an irrational horrific act.  So, after some fine police investigation the two are found out and, under pressure, they confess.  At this time in history it seems like ""case closed"" with the death penalty for both.  Excepting these turns of events enters Clarance Darrow, perhaps the most effective and non-conventional, defense attorney.  Darrow weaves a dazzling defense in which he portrays the boys as simply youths who by the nature of their pampered upbringing are unwitting vessels of evil all men are capable of.  It saves their lives and divides a country.  It's, however, an important shot over the bough as it becomes the epicenter of an entire society's rethinking of capital punishment.

So, even if you've never heard of this case, or are a student of Darrow's law...this case rings throughout everything that follows a death sentence trajectory.  I think the thing that gets lost in history, besides the fact that so few really know of this case, is that there was a young life that was prematurely ended by the evil that Darrow convinces the judge, any man is capable of.  In this, theres 's a warning of human frailty which can, somehow, do the unthinkable.  Thus, in moving forward, more than fixating on a singular crime and capital punishment, perhaps, we should be studying how the entire unimaginable can happen so easily.  In other words,this is the first case where mental health and capital punishment were both put under the microscope.

Darrow never saw the quantum shift in society's belief in capital punishment as being the primary deterrent to murderous crime, but his legacy certainly did.  With as many states denouncing capital punishment as not his battle cry received legs way past his own lifetime.

After watching this documentary I'd have to say Darrow was the lynchpin in the movement even as he failed to achieve an immediate widespread rethinking..  This, of course, is of great importance.  The other take-away is that try as scientists and sociologist may,  they'll never fully understand how some very well-bread human beings turn to the darkest of criminals.  Is is totally a chance type thing or is it pre-programmed?  It's still unclear today excepting for the fact that in the end we view the perpetrators as horrifically flawed...or, sometimes, possessed of pure evil?

In this landmark case, Clarence Darrow was, against all held beliefs at the time, able to portend that the still developing human brain was susceptible to great darkness.  It did not preclude the defendants still being young impressionable humans.  It was as if they were also victims, albeit lesser ones, to their own hubris.  It was enough to sway a judge to go against the popular belief of a death sentence at the time.  In that it was truly remarkable,  to which the judge in question was widely ridiculed.  Past all of this it began a quantum shift in that 50-years on many states have dispensed with the simple solution of the death sentence.  So, regardless is you are like minded or not, this is an important documentary that, largely, lets the entirety of the story on paper for further scrutiny.  One gets the bottom line that justice was served in a variety of ways.  See it and decide for yourself.",1468540800,5,3427,4.907826086956522

7603541,5,B01AJ7ELT4,"The new documentary, ""The Perfect Crime,"" produced and directed by Cathleen O'Connell, was recently seen via PBS, and is fascinating.

The sixty-minute work concerns itself with the infamous Leopold & Loeb case of 1924 Chicago, when a pair of teen-aged intellectuals murdered the fourteen-year-old Robert Franks in cold blood.  All three were of Jewish descent, and were scions of families with great fortunes.

From the perspective of today, it is apparent that we are speaking of a charming psychopath (Richard Loeb) and one who was helplessly in love with said psychopath (Nathan Leopold, Jr), under the influence of a misinterpretation of the complex philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche.  The contemporary press sensationalized the case, which culminated in the famous attorney Clarence Darrow successfully winning for the young men life imprisonment rather than the barbaric death-penalty.  Loeb was murdered in prison in 1936, and Leopold survived to write a remarkable and sad autobiography, ""LIFE plus 99 Years"" (1958), was released from prison the same year, and died in Puerto Rico in 1971.

The amount of art-works produced in the wake of the murder has been notable:  The play, ""Rope"" (1929), which was made into a film worthy for its cinematic chic by Sir Alfred Hitchcock (1948); Meyer Levin's astonishing novel, ""Compulsion"" (1956), which was in turn filmed in 1959, and features a remarkable performance from Orson Welles as a fictionalized Darrow; and the experimental film, ""Swoon,"" directed by Tom Kalin (1992).  Other plays, books, and even a musical-comedy have been produced, as well.

This documentary examines the case with unusual and succinct perspicacity, yet still leaves us with questions concerning such aberrant behavior from two promising youths of seemingly unlimited potential.",1460937600,,1809,5.455197132616488

8747541,5,B01AJ7ELT4,"This documentary was fascinating. It covers (broadly) the crime committed in 1924 when two 19 year old men (boys?) plot to kidnap and murder a boy from their neighborhood. If you're unfamiliar with this story, this is a good overview. I recommend picking up the book on this subject by Hal Higdon which is a well researched and thorough look at the crime from before it was committed to well after Leopold and Loeb were imprisoned and what eventually happened to both. It was an incredible crime, like many since, that the general public cannot wrap their minds around---why??",1533686400,,576,4.828282828282828

8747543,5,B01AJ7ELT4,"I enjoyed it. Glad Amazon prime is gettting some good documentaries. I'd have liked to know more about all the people in the case, like the nanny and the prosecutor. How did they handle the governess in those days and what became of her? Were people scandalized by what she did or was it no big deal? Very impressive how they zeroed in on the killers. Who exactly was it that was in charge of investigating those glasses and figuring out that it belonged to one of three people?

The killers were bright, but didn't they know that those missing glasses could be important? Did they try to find them? Why did they talk and give so much away. If they were masterminds they should have known to keep their mouths shut so apparently they weren't too sophisticated.",1531353600,,760,4.507246376811594

Moderately interesting documentary about a case that grabbed the headlines in Chicago in 1924.  Not sure why it was such a big deal as there were no surprises really.  Their confessions meant there was no mystery.  Just a rather dull case.,1530316800,,377,4.828125

If the subject is interesting enough I will research it on my own later. This documentary gave me just enough information, and not just the facts of the case: I think it gave a round overview of the contemporary setting as well as the contemporary psychological theories brought to bear on the case, following up with a clean retrospective analysis. 5 stars",1528934400,,497,4.595505617977528
8747549,5,B01AJ7ELT4,"This is a well written and presented Documentary that holds the viewers attention.  The inclusion of original video,still photos, documents,and  statements are always more interesting than reproductions. It not only delves into the lives of the two men who performed this ""thrill"" crime, their families and social status, it also provides in depth details of their Lawyer and his use of Freud-ism and ""Alienist"" views of the teen age criminals' mindset to premeditate and execute such a horrendous act of violence.

In addition, it accurately conveys the statutes and processes of the Judicial System of the era. An underlying fact that attracts me personally to this Documentary is how Media, although prevalent in print, did not affect the outcome of the the trial unlike the current system.",1528675200,,793,5.228346456692913
