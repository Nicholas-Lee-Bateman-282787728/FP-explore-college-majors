8239336,5,B000078U3O,"Excellent, excellent instruction. This is the 1st of a 4-series set and is truly for a beginner to Pilates. The exercises in this DVD is to build up your core strength in a safe way without straining your neck and back.

 Moira is not the one doing the exercises. She is talking as another is doing them. She gives many instructions to make sure you are breathing properly as the breathing is an important part of Pilates. But even more important is her instructions to keep you doing the moves in the correct postures so that the moves are safe.

In between exercises she doesn't talk and talk while leaving you hanging waiting for the next move to begin. This was the problem with Winsor Pilates--it got very annoying to wait for the next exercise to begin.

Another thing I love about this Stott Pilates series is that there is a good stretch/warm-up session at the beginning. Also, many harder Pilates exercises are in a modified form in this DVD. It is still a challenge for a beginner and a great way to build the strength so that you can safely do the harder full exercise in the next series and beyond. There are also exercises on this tape that are not on the Winsor Pilates tapes.

If you are a beginner, definitely get this 4 series set. It will challenge you as you safely gain the strength needed to progress to the next in the series, the second one--""Firm and Fit"". You will love how Sott Pilates makes you feel!!",1109894400,18,1428,4.4559386973180075
