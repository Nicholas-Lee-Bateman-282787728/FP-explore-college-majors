6731457,5,B00OAIHHRC,"This NBC series holds the very important distinction of being so much more successfull than the show (Different Strokes) it spun off from. After retooling the first season---and adding a new girl---it definently became a blockbuster hit for the network.

Even perpetual change in venues, from Eastland Academy, to Edna's Eddibles, and then finally Over Our Heads really didn't sink the show. Or Blair and Jo leaving for college. The writers of this series figured out how to succesfully transition the series so all the girls could continue hanging out together and having credible storylines.

Their stories addressed important issues which teen comedies even now are too frightened to openly cover such as teen prostitution, suicide, parental death, and abortion. Good luck trying to get this on a sitcom in today's lineup. TV has gotten so scared of talking with young adults--particularly girls. It now only talks down to them. When there were essentially only three networks and a lot less competition for ratings, television writers had much more room to experiment.

Ever-present tension between Jo Polniaczek and Blair Warner addressed socioeconmic issues. Both characters initially chafe at the idea of becomming roommates together at Eastland. Talking Blair and the others into taking a school van out to a bar, Jo ultimately gets the entire 'gang' to have to room together---in order to pay off incurred damages. All of these girls will now have to work under Mrs. Garett's watchfull eye in the school cafeteria as their punnishment for the first seasons. They are quickly placed on KP duty!!

As you can imagine, this horrifies the group--including rich Blair. She is not used to either washing dishes or serving up food. She now has to wait on others!! This immediately seems worse than any trick Tootie could have ever pulled.

Finding out they all liked living together after all, the girls proactively decide to continue their living arrangement after probation ends and the repairs are completed. They ultimately agree to disagree. But now they cannot stand the thought of living apart from each other!! This becomes worse than any punishment.

They continue rooming in college (when people are supposed to change) and even post-college. When Mrs. Garett leaves Eastland and opens up her own gourmet shop, they decide to follow her over. They are no longer doing community service hours like at Eastlad---and now are her friends who want to work and make sure Edna's Eddibles succeeds. Mrs Garrett has moved from being a disciplinarian to a mentor and a friend.

When the shop mysteriously burns down after people are away on vacation, the series is refreshed by opening up a late 1980's gift shop (check out the neon...etc!). A very young George Clooney guest stars as hunky repairman George. George is more interested in flirting with the girls than properly completing the job on time. The girls find out that the hippest repairman isn't always their best choice after all.

 When the job is finally completed, Mrs. Garrett stays for a couple of more episodes, but is also aware that the girls did not need a 'mother figure' anymore and this is all she personally knows how to do, so she leaves the series. This is perhaps the most dramatic cast change because Mrs. Garrett was the person who initially spun off the series itself. Her leaving is a BIG transition.

Younger sister Beverly Ann (Cloris Leachman) moves in. She is more of a friend and counselor rather than a parent. Beverly Ann would later take in Andy Moffet (Mackenzie Astin) as a delivery boy for the shop.

It's a testament to both the writers and actors that this series premise was convincing through so many season and cast changes. Many a real-life friendship ends after high school and/or college simply because people do change as they do get older. This ensemble made it look so cool and desirable, like the 'in thing' to do---rather than a bunch of old fuddy duddies who do not naturally grow up. And it's not just because this was the era when there were 3 networks either. The series had good writers and good cast members.

The only thing (other than the computers and fashion) which now appears incredibly dated are cloying attitudes whenever Gerri Jewell comes on screen. She makes guest appearances throughout the series as 'cousin Gerri', Blair's handicapped cousin'.

Because ADA wasn't on the books yet, a school like Eastland did not even have to accommodate Cousin Gerri. It was then presumed that merely because she talks funny that she also cannot intellectually perform the same 'tough' work as Blair. Nobody ever decides to see if she infact has the same academic skills. And this stereotyping supposed to be entertainment Her parents (and Blair's relatives) never petitioned for her admission to Eastland even with all of their wealth and special connections, which Blair made a point of promoting herself.

The main cast just kind of tolerate Geri when she is on screen. The characters are all obviously trying to be nice. But they are not sure how to correctly respond after one of her public statements about being 'different'. They awkwardly glance around, laugh, and quickly move onto something else they DO want to deal with.

It sticks out (and even badly dates the series) because our expectations for people with disabilities have dramatically changed and widened since these episodes originally aired. We now expect more.

Gerri finally gets a 'leadership' role in 'All by herself"" when she and Blair are fundraising for a school for disabled children. Fundraising itself would be impossible without skills such as organization and conviction. So we do know that Gerri is smart.  We also see that Blair is not embarassed by Geri. But she is 'concerned' that Gerri will have a harder time--which actually given what laws did/did not exist in the 1980's was a very realistic assessment. It upset and puzzled me watching the episodes while I attended a public school.  But I now understand the idea of 'reasonable accomodation' and what a private school did and did not have to do without any ADA then available.",1413936000,21,6131,4.970703125

6731475,5,B00OAIHHRC,"I already have all the seasons of this series but I went ahead and ordered this one for two reasons.  One, the 1987 movie ""The Facts of Life Down Under"" wasn't included like ""The Facts of Life Goes to Paris"" was in one of the season sets.  And two, the series set takes up less room in my TV-DVD library that continues to fill up w/ more titles as I add them.  FOL is one of the most enjoyable shows and I'd never tire of watching it.  I'm pleased to say all the seasons have closed captioning (CC), the subtitles available, in English only.  I trust the aforementioned movie as well as another bonus apparently not included previously (the 2014 reunion special, if I remember right) has it as well.

6731490,5,B00OAIHHRC,"First off, thanks to my mother for getting me this for Christmas! :-)

This set is great, and here's why:

* NO two-sided discs! (I hate those!)
* Compact, neatly arranged sets arranged in season clusters (seasons 1 & 2, seasons 3 & 4, etc.)
* A little booklet with summaries of each episode!
* It includes closed captions (although I'm still on season 2, so I don't know if the whole set is captioned), but the actresses enunciate so clearly (unlike modern-day television actors) that I find myself turning OFF my closed captions! And I'm half-deaf!!!
* Tootie on roller skates! That's what I'm talking about.

Love it, love it, love it! I've greatly enjoyed rewatching these episodes.",1453161600,2,686,4.7478991596638656

I had to get a replacement sent because the 1st set some discs/episodes did not work.  The replacement set i got, DIFFERENT discs and episodes didn't work.  Wait for another company to release these on dvds.",1448928000,2,380,4.449275362318841
6731494,5,B00OAIHHRC,"For those of you who are mega fans of this show I have to tell you to BUY THIS COMPLETE SERIES SET! Since this series has been showing on various television stations I bet you have tried to watch it whenever and where ever it was being shown. The thing about all those showings that I noticed was that the episodes are chopped for time and were missing a minute here and there. Well let me tell you all how WONDERFUL and REFRESHING it is to see those episodes just as they were when originally aired. I am sitting here today, smiling ear to ear, laughing too because I had completely forgotten how truly enjoyable this show was in its original length. You get used to the reruns and the way the dialogue is performed so seeing the show now is a shock to the system(in a good way). I am tipping my hat to SHOUT! and sending thanks for this complete series DVD box set. I had read some critical reviews about playback and various complaints about quality that almost had me NOT buy this set. I have been watching on my computer and my discs are quite perfect in all ways. I know for sure that I would not see this the same way if I chose to watch on today's HD t.v.'s or a larger flat screen t.v. The reality is that you really can not transfer old video to look like digital. if you have glitches or scratches on the discs that is an issue but please try not to expect the overall technical quality to be up to today's standards. Just pretend it is the '80's and you are watching it in your room on your little 13 inch television. revel in the memories it will evoke and try not to want it to be more than it is. I know that true fans will be thrilled with this set. I will revise my review if I find any of those issues that others have spoken about but so far I am sincerely satisfied with my purchase. It was the perfect set to buy to get me through the soon to be here Winter season. A gift to myself because as Blair would say, I am worth it! you are too, so buy it!",1448755200,5,1970,4.066838046272494

GOSHHHHHH  UGGHHHH  PEOPLE CAN BE SOO FREAKING ANNOYING AND WONDER WHY THESE SHOWS DONT GET RELEASE FAST IF I WORK  AT THE STUDIOS  . I WOULDNT RELEASE EITER  CAUSE YOU TAKE TIME  SECURE DEALS  PAY FOR THE SHOWS  PRESS THE DVDS  AND  ALL PEOPLE DO IS CRITISCISM AND COMPLAIN.  WE SHOULD REJOICE IN HAPPINESS  AND THANKS SHOUT . Cause had it not been we still would have not seen the show in its entirety  full unedit form  remember these tv channels  edit the show and don't play all epsiodes  only cetain ones over and over and over  stop complaining wack people,1446854400,3,1367,4.282868525896414
6731500,2,B00OAIHHRC,"Sadly, returning this set for a refund the same day it arrived. As an uber fan of the series, I'd  purchased the individual season DVDs over the years as they were released and was beyond excited to have a full set in hand. The DVD quality, however, is bad. Truly, surprisingly, monumentally bad. It's as if SHOUT used a higher compression (and sure, I get HD and higher tech was not available when the show filmed) that even when watching on a non-HD, 30 inch office telly the ghost shadows are cast, there's hollow sound, and the picture never fully comes into focus.

And...the first five seasons were loaded on one more disk per season than is in this set.

I love the show, I sort of hate this set. Buyer be warned. ;)",1446595200,,723,4.380597014925373
6731501,5,B00OAIHHRC,"I relied on the reviews of others to make a decision about whether or not to purchase this set, so I figured I would add mine to the list now that I have it in hand.  In short, I am very happy with my purchase!  I was a bit worried about video quality, because I did purchase The Wonder Years DVD set a few months ago.  As some may know, that series was filmed from 1988 - 1993 - well AFTER The Facts of Life.  I was alarmed to see that some of the video quality on The Wonder Years episodes was extremely grainy - surprisingly so.  In fact, Netflix has the entire WY series online, and the episodes from Netflix are much CLEARER than the ones in the CD set (which, btw, I paid $200 for).  So you can imagine why I was very hesitant about purchasing Facts of Life.  I am delighted to say that the video quality on this FOL set is very satisfactory.  Of course it is not HD, but it is very respectable - especially for a series that was filmed in the early 80s.  I have not watched every single episode yet, but I have found no vid quality issues thus far.  Someone in one of the reviews mentioned that some of the audio in the episode ""62 Pickup"" was missing.  I did NOT find this to be the case with my set.  Maybe they fixed the issue?  If so, I'm glad!

I grew up watching this series (I was Kim Fields'/Tootie's age, and the show ran from the time I was about 10 to when I was about 19), and I remember it so fondly.  I admired all of the girls, but the Jo character was always my fave.  Nancy McKeon is so naturally talented (she was EVERYWHERE in the 80s!), and I am still wondering why her later career did not bring her more visibility and an even higher degree of success.  Would love to see her in another series.  I am finding that watching these episodes makes me laugh even harder than it did when I watched them as a kid.  The jokes are funnier, and the memories even sweeter.  This was (and is) a show about female friendship - one of the strongest bonds you can experience in life.  The experiences of these teenage girls are ones that most everyone whose ever BEEN a teenage girl can relate to, and the show never talked ""down"" to its audience. Great cast, great chemistry, and the stories hold up well.  Even the occasional dated mention makes me smile, and anyone who grew up in the 80s will recognize it all - the hair, the fascination with Duran Duran and Springsteen, the approach to daily life in an age when cell phones and iPads were simply not in existence.

The extras in this set are also fun, but the one I really wanted to see was the 2014 cast reunion at The Paley Center.  This reunion was live-streamed in September of 2014 on the night it took place.  Be warned that the version of the event on the DVD is an EDITED version.  If you watched the live-stream, you may notice that certain chunks are (unfortunately) missing.  Even the edited version still runs about 40-45 minutes though, and contains plenty of feel-good moments.  Kim Fields is missing, but she does send a video message to her former colleagues.  Everyone really looks great, and Lisa Whelchel especially looks like she could put on her Eastland uniform tomorrow and resume production.  She looks almost exactly the same!  Great to see Charlotte Rae still going strong at 89, and it is heartwarming to see the way she interacts with the girls (now women) and they her.  If you are a longtime fan of FOL, you really WANT this cast to like each other, and it is evident from the reunion piece that they truly do.  Nancy and Lisa seem to have formed a lifelong bond of friendship, and it will put a smile on your face to witness it.

Overall, this is a lovely box set, and the show feels every bit as wonderful as I remember it.  Buy it, and pop in some FOL when you're feeling blue and want to laugh and remember.  Blair, Jo, Natalie, Tootie, and Mrs. G. are bound to make you smile all over again - over 35 years after they did it the first time!",1445040000,20,3945,4.241286863270777

I ordered this box set and got it the next day. The storage box is nice and sturdy and the DVDs are nicely arranged by season. The printing kind of looks like they are bootlegs from a New Jersey off ramp but who cares. The quality is a bit grainy but I don't think the show was meant to be seen on a 50 inch tv. They have not been restored to glorious dvd quality but it's nice to have the whole series on DVD. A must for any TRUE fan!,1430697600,4,593,3.7903225806451615
6731513,4,B00OAIHHRC,"I am so happy to have finally found this series on DVD as it is a childhood favorite.  Have been waiting for years for it!!  Watching the shows bring back wonderful memories of Jo, Tootie, Natalie, Blair and Mrs. G.  And the extras are really fun to watch as well.  Spent a few evenings re-watching and enjoying this amazing show.

Package wise, it is so cute.  The outer box is a sturdy cardboard with the seasons tucked inside.  I also like the little book with the episode run down.  Presentation wise, I give this a A+.  Some of the DVDs though have dust on them and need to wiped off prior to playing them as they will not play. That's a pretty small detail though and as long as I remember to do that, DVDs really do play nicely.",1429833600,6,735,4.23021582733813

6731523,5,B00OAIHHRC,"While having just received this product, and not yet viewing it, I must say it is about time the whole series was produced.  Unfortunately I had all the released sets, but figured this might be a short lived production, so decided it best to invest in the whole series.  In the past other series waited forever to release some seasons, which ended up costing almost as much as it did to just bite the bullet and get the whole set.  I'm pleased it has the  bonus movies added along with an information guide.  If you order it get it open and check each case out.  Mine was perfectly boxed, neither the box nor the item itself showed any defect.  When I took each set out I noticed a couple of the DVD cases were smashed and unusable.  So be sure to check it when you get it.  To all the other huge fans like me who watched this each week.....ENJOY!!!!",1426032000,4,850,4.2625

6731529,5,B00OAIHHRC,"Gregarious, hilarious, and never nefarious, the four musketeers generated sparks that, unlike Natalie's exam hat, never ran at half-wattage.

The box set is designed colorfully and compactly. The DVD cases boast that ubiquitous phthalate scent we've all come to know and loathe, but if you can get past that, watching these eighties ladies is a blast.

There are some inconsistencies in sound quality (some episodes are significantly louder than others, and in one episode, Blair has a line with no accompanying volume). Also, the movies on the Bonus disk should have been closed captioned, and the closed captions in general should have been more accurate and grammatical.

But hey - you take the good, you take the bad.

You take 'em both and there you have The Facts of Life for life.",1424736000,4,787,4.9393939393939394
6731530,5,B00OAIHHRC,"Thank you, JBE",1424736000,,14,4.0
6731531,5,B00OAIHHRC,"I grew up watching this show. Re-watching these episodes bring back a lot of memories for me. We all had our favorites. My older sister loved Jo, my younger sister loved Natalie, I - being the only male in the household, favored Blair. Although I didn't follow the show from the beginning (I was far too young during the shows first couple of seasons), I did catch most of these episodes on re-runs in the late 80's. Today, watching these episodes as an adult brings a whole new perspective. Many deals with very serious topics - drugs, alcohol, jealousy, cancer, teenage prostitution etc and are discussed in a light-hearted manner while throwing in some laughs as well. The first season is an almost different show with a cast made up of mostly young girls, including Molly Ringwald. The show was re-tweaked for Season 2 with a lot of the characters getting the axe. From Season 2 onward, the cast consisted mainly of the motherly Mrs. Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae), the conceited, pretty blonde, Blair Warner (Lisa Welchel), the comedic aspiring writer, Natalie Green (Mindy Cohn), her best friend, Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsey (Kim Fields) and the no-nonsense, in-your-face Joanne ""Jo"" Polniaczek (Nancy McKean). Cloris Leachman who plays Mrs. Garrett's sister, Beverly Anne Stickle, joined the cast in season 8 after Rae's departure from the show. Many of the episodes are a bit over-dramatic providing more drama than laughs but when the show is called ""The Facts of Life"", this should be expected. Despite this, many episodes featured here are charming, some incredibly funny.

All seasons have their highlights and I have personal favorites from each season. If I had to choose my favorite seasons, I would have to go with Season 6- 8. Season 7 is note-worthy because it added George Clooney to the cast who graced the show with his usual charm but most importantly, had good chemistry with the girls. He also appears in some of my favorite episodes - ""Truck Stop"", ""Doo-Wah"", ""Seven Little Indians"" and ""A Star is Torn"".

There are also some interesting extras. Both movies, ""The Facts of Life Goes to Paris"" (1982) and ""The Facts of Life Down Under"" (1987) are featured. Although I never warmed up to their Paris adventure, their Australian adventure is a hoot. I remember watching it on its original airing in 1987 and loving it, especially Jo and Blair's mad-cap storyline and I must say, re-watching it now, it still retains its charm. Another interesting extra is a 2014 Cast Reunion at the Paley Centre which features Nancy McKean, Lisa Welchel, Mindy Cohn, Geri Jewell and Charlotte Rae. Kim Fields appears briefly via a video message. They offer some delightful insight on the show and some funny commentary and I have to add that McKean and Welchel look as ravishing as ever and it is a delight to see Mrs. Garrett again after all of these years. She is pushing 90 but her humor and charm is intact.

A booklet is also provided listing all episodes along with a brief synopsis of each one.

My only complain is with the picture quality on some of the episodes. I have not seen all episodes from this set. I already owned seasons 1 - 5 and I had seen these seasons prior and found no issues with the sound or picture quality. Here, I jumped straight ahead to the seasons I was interested in, seasons 6 - 9, and found some episodes were a bit too grainy. Living in an age where everything is in HD, this is a disappointment. I found no issues with the sound.

For those wanting a little bit of nostalgia with a little added charm and humor, I wholeheartedly recommend this box set. Although some of the episodes are heavy on melodrama, and at times, Mindy Cohn appears to be laughing at her own jokes - LOL, when the show works, it works splendidly and it is wonderfully acted. Every season has its highlights and practically everyone can identify with a lot of these characters and the topics being discussed. Times and fashions have definitely changed since these girls were in Prime-Time but the issues they bring to the forefront and the humor live on.",1424131200,8,4066,4.729196050775741
6731532,5,B00OAIHHRC,"My recent review was about how expensive this collection was.

6731537,4,B00OAIHHRC,"While it is one of my favorite series and am delighted to finally have it in its entirety, I was disappointed in the video quality of this set for the price. I didn't expect HD, but the image quality is not very good. I've seen reruns on TV of the show with better quality of picture. It's not awful, but not up to par with other complete series DVD sets I've purchased at lesser prices.  There are hesitations in the video on occasion (hard to explain, but the video goes almost on pause like watching something online and the video has to catch up with bandwidth capability is my best attempt at explaining it). I've honestly purchased DVD packages of 50 movies of certain themes for 10 bucks that had better picture quality.
I love the series and appreciate having it in entirety, but wish it could've been visually better for the price.",1422057600,7,840,4.490196078431373

Sometimes that can be a recipe for disaster. All the these actresses are amazing.",1421366400,4,356,4.25
6731541,5,B00OAIHHRC,"I've been meaning to pick up the first five seasons which have been previously released for a long time. Now I'm glad I never got around to it. As soon as I saw this I ordered it, and I'm not sorry I did. It is packaged in a sturdy outer box with with five traditional-looking DVD cases, each of which holds multiple discs. The first four cases hold two seasons each, while the final one holds season nine and the bonus features disc. I'm really happy that they didn't devise some sort of wildly over-sized, lopsided case with cardboard sleeves that only serve to damage the discs. No, you'll have no problem fitting this on a shelf with the rest of your collection, and rest assured the discs will stay well protected.
Video quality is about as good as can be expected for a DVD set. Of course, I would have preferred it on Blu, but I doubt it would have looked much better. As far as the extras go, they have included a couple of mildly informative featurettes, the Diff'rent Strokes episode, 'The Girls' School,' from which The Facts of Life was spun, and the two TV movies: The Facts of Life Goes to Paris, and The Facts of Life Down Under. Also included is a 2014 reunion, which is essentially a panel interview with a few of the original cast members, and a trivia game. Finally, there is a booklet that includes the names and descriptions of all of the episodes.
My only small complaint is that they didn't include the 2001 reunion movie. That, in my opinion, really would have rounded out the set. However, we can't have everything, can we? The bottom line is that the good far outweighs the bad, and if you are a fan of the series, then you really can't go wrong with this set. Highly recommended.",1421366400,36,1706,4.419047619047619

Beautifully designed box set with DVDs in protective plastic cases, a commemorative booklet along with a ton of extras.  They just don't make series like this anymore and with the crapola on tv these days, it's wonderful to watch this series (which by the way never ages) again and again.

6731544,5,B00OAIHHRC,"Shout Factory's strategy of releasing shows in Complete Series sets seems to be working well for them since in the last couple of years they've brought us ""Leave it To Beaver"", ""Barney Miller"", ""Bob Newhart"", ""Dobie Gillis"", ""Mary Hartman"", ""All In the Family"" and ""The Jeffersons"" to name a few. ""Maude"" is coming in a few months and I just received my copy of THE FACTS OF LIFE: THE COMPLETE SERIES since I ordered early direct from their website.

Encased in a bright, colorful and sturdy outer box, there are 5 plastic cases inside and each one houses two seasons of the show, except for the last which contains Season 9 and the Bonus Features (The Paley Center Reunion, a Trivia Feature, an episode of ""Diff'rent Strokes"" as well as the two TV-Movies ""Goes to Paris"" (1982) and ""Down Under"" (1987).

It's wonderful to finally own all 201 episodes of this iconic sitcom. The only music clearance issue occurs in the Season 7 episode ""Tootie's Graduation"" where the song ""Ease on Down the Road"" had to be cut; otherwise everything else is complete, including the songs in the ""Cruising"" episode as well as the ones with El Debarge and Stacey Q. So with the exception of that one cut episode, diehard fans can now toss those old VHS tapes of Seasons 6-9.

Plus this set is too expensive. Update:I thought there was one more season left I was wrong. I would buy this set when the price drops and I'm sure it will. Just gets annoying when you have spent money on something then the complete season comes along and you have to buy the ones you have bought already.
