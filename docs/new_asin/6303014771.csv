545619,2,6303014771,"Alex and her friends are invited to test out a brand-new video game, Arcade, which promises that ""Reality will never be the same."" Unfortunately for them, it's true! Arcade sucks in its players in to the gaming world to compete in a battle of life or death against the sinister force that controls it! While the special effects are severely dated by today's standards, ARCADE creates an incredible virtual world that can easily compete with the level of design found in THE LAWNMOWER MAN or HACKERS from the same era. John de Lancie, Megan Ward, A.J. Langer, and Seth Green all populate the young cast from their pre-television days, working off of a script by BATMAN BEGINS' David Goyer. The third-rate performances and unconvincing plot do not take away from the overall enjoyment of the picture, although it does rely heavily on the audience's willingness to suspend disbelief. ARCADE amounts to nothing more than a light horror version of TRON that is safe enough for an after school special, but if you are a fan of THE LAWNMOWER MAN or the ""Bishop of Battle"" segment from 1983's NIGHTMARES, be sure to check this one out!

545621,4,6303014771,"Back in the early 90's Full Moon movies still had a certain kind of charm that always left one looking forward to their next release. This was before they started pumping out garbage on a $500 budget shot in 1 day. Despite their current films being virtually unwatchable, we still have a true enjoyment of the low budget B goodness they produced throughout the early part of our favorite decade. When we stumbled upon Arcade we knew it would have to be something special. Well little did we know the film would star one of our most cherished movie characters as the star. The one and only Ralphy, not to be confused with Ralphus, from the epic non-B Christmas Story. It was one of those moments where you're looking at the screen saying ""wait...is that?"" but quickly dismiss it as a possibility. It doesn't help when you've just partaken in a little Matt Collins, forcing you to think your just imagining it. However IMDB confirmed it creating quite a buzz around the event. Honestly we had just assumed Ralphy had only done one film...never even thought to check and see if he's delved into B. Well were a little more then pleasantly surprised.

Arcade is ensconced in 90's feel centering it's film around a virtual reality video game. Now this was a time when Arcades were still ""the place to be"" making the film very relevant for the time. It starts out with a group of buddies whose sole ambition is to hang out at the local arcade known as Dante's Inferno. In this group is a couple girls, Ralphy, and a young Seth Greene...whose easily as annoying as he is now. However this was his finest work since Airborne. When at Dante's Inferno they learn of a new game that is supposed to be a mind altering experience. In this case ""mind altering"" consists of the most incredible hilarious graphics we have ever seen. At one point in the game a screen saver came up that Sid had actually enjoyed while baked! It was hilarious and yet another moment of ""wait a minute...is that?"" Turns out Ralphy is not only known for his official Red Rider carbon pistol expertise, but is also quite ""the balls"" in video game domination. He starts the video challenge which stem down to his friends, then some of them go missing. Turns out this game warps your mind and sucks you in to it's world of B graphics. Turns out the company used actual brain cells in the game which allows the game to have a mind of its own. In the end Ralphy and his main women defeat the game and go on to enjoy a life of B together.

Arcade was simply a one of a kind experience that could only be captured by Full Moon of the early 90's. This is yet again more proof of why this decade had so much going for it. We have been exposed to so many hilarious B movies over the years, all courtesy of this magical little period of time. Obviously a movie of this caliber is only for a very specific type of viewer. This is not one for someone seeking more then some extremely light hearted yet hilarious entertainment. There is not one aspect about Arcade that could be considered scary at any point, but the enjoyment value is off the charts. If you were a kid or teen in the 90's then this film should had got that feel you're sure to jump out of your stocking for. Even if you have no interest, it's worth the watch just to see this games graphics. They're so fantastic in every way imaginable. They contain the depth of Oregon Trail while your picking off some squirrels.",1337385600,9,3432,4.420221169036335
545622,5,6303014771,"I first watched this movie when I was about ten. If you liked Tron, then you would like this. It has a killer ending to boot, the kind of twists that you don't see in the high action movies today.",1197936000,5,196,3.925
545623,3,6303014771,"This is a harmless little sci-fi for pre-teens that mom and dad can scan at any time and see no sex and only a touch or two of violence grace the screen.  The plot and pseudo-science are of the leave-your-brain-at-home variety while the graphics are nothing special.  The direction is slow, clear and undistinguished.  The photography is pedestrian, but not bad.  The cast is cute, led by the beautiful Megan Ward.

She is demure and fully clothed as a teenaged heroine who saves her boy friend and pals from an evil virtual-reality game gone amuck.  The fact that she was 23-years-old at the time and a little too old for the part did not bother me at all.  Her fresh face and great beauty allowed me to watch the whole thing!

The once vampish Sharon Farrell has a small part as the star's mom which she plays flawlessly with just a touch of irony.",1091145600,5,850,4.474025974025974
545624,1,6303014771,"Good Science Fiction is never condescending.  This is why the makers of Star Trek (old and new)consult with scientists to make the unbelievable seem believable in theory.  Ah, but, perhaps it is my affinity of John DeLancie (Star Trek's ""Q"") that prompted me to buy this shallow attempt at a Science Fiction movie.  DeLancie, after all, is in it.  Unfortunatly, he plays a very very minor role here.
Plot Synopsis: DeLancie is a software game marketer whose job is on the bubble if he does not market an addictive game soon.  He hogties a group of kids into being beta testers for a new untested virtual reality game called ""Arcade"".  The game somehow manages to make the kids literally disappear and ""steals thier souls"".
The protagonist, (played by Megan Ward) a girl who is having emotional problems due to her mother's suicide (not that it matters), is the first to notice the bizzare effects of the game when she suspects that her boyfriend has disappeared while playing the game (see below).  She brings home a portable version of the game and hooks it up to her TV set and the game proceeds to taunt her and calls by her first name.  At one point the game calls her a ""bit_h"" and rants ""I AM ARCADE, I AM THE FUTURE"" (hysterical laughter).
After finding another friend dead from the effects of the game (she too disappears after death like Yoda), Ward and another friend go to see DeLancie.  DeLancie, after about 20 seconds of screen time, then introduces her to the game's designer.  Apparently, he does not fully understand the workings of the game and confesses to using human brain cells in the construction of the software (oh...my...God hold me back).  Finally, the protagonist realizes that the only way to rescue her disappeared friends is to win the game.
This idea could have worked if excecuted as Sci Fi-proper, or even horror, or even action.  However, in trying to toe the line between three genres, the film makes some glaring mistakes.
Primarily, the lack of any semi-viable explanations for the following elements of the movie will make the informed sci-fi grind teeth. First, and foremost, how does the game make people disappear?  - C'mon throw me a bone here. Is there some kind ""molecular disruption interface"" that causes it to consume living matter as well as dead tissue?  If so, why bother marketing it as a game when you can make much more selling it to the CIA?  Second, how do you incorporate ""human brain cells"" into a softare program?  Perhaps you smash them up with a mortar and pestle and smear them all over your hard drive?
No, in the end, we are expected to believe that the some things are just unexplainable.  The program (I suppose because of the  brain cells or something) is supernatural.  Then, this is NOT Sci Fci.
Three things could heve redeemed this movie. First, thoughtful explanations could have been worked out for the bizarre behavior of ""Arcade"".  Scientific ones.  Second, the game itself, could have been more exciting in terms of its special effects.  Two levels of the game look like bad versions of that game from the Lawnmower Man.  Like the lack of explanations for the plotline the game is also thoughlessly constructed.  Finally, I know that DeLancie is a talented writer as well as actor.  I'll bet a dollar to a donut that if it the producers of this movie would have given him creative access to the script, he could have probably saved the day.",1089417600,,3416,4.71043771043771
545625,5,6303014771,"A revolutionary game is waiting to play with you. ARCADE transports players into an incredible world of virtual reality where any adventure is possible and your wildest imagination takes on electric flesh. The kids are dying to play it. But ARCADE is not fun and games. It's powered by a demonic soul whose intention is not only to beat those who play, but to imprison them in a hellish oblivion.
When several friends mysteriously disappear, it is Alex (Megan Ward, Encino Man) who suspects the terrifying truth. With the help of her friend Nick (Peter Billingsley, A Christmas Story), Alex decides to enter ARCADE in a heroic effort to rescue their friends. As Alex journeys through the games' seven levels, she encounters a lethal chrome dragon, crosses a sea of darkness, and endures enough terror to test her sanity. Filled with stunning computer effects, ARCADE will take you on a thrilling ride into a realm where you can kiss reality goodbye.",1024876800,4,949,4.900621118012422

7836028,1,6303014771,"If I saw this movie when it 1st came out in 1993 I can't imagine I would've even liked it back then. Arcade started out interesting enough (I guess you could say) but as it went along it got worse. I usually try & read the description of a movie or a little something before I watch it but this time I didn't. I wish I would've then I wouldn't have expected to like the movie as much as I thought I would. I expected Arcade to be a movie about an arcade (I use to LOVE going to the arcade) but it wasn't, it was about a single game named Arcade. You know if you took all the R-rated stuff out, You'd have an episode of Goosebumps or The Haunting Hour? I wish I could've at least said this movie was good but I can't. When Alex had to go inside the game to beat it & rescue her friends, that had to be some of the worst graphics in a movie I've ever seen. You know those REALLY bad Youtube videos where people make their own special effects or graphics? That's exactly what it was like. Even if you LOVE BAD movies as much as I do, I couldn't recommend watching this movie unless you want to torture yourself. Not only were the graphics bad but it was BORING as well",1495670400,,1165,4.0042918454935625

7836031,4,6303014771,"I cannot believe i actually liked this. It had a lot of nostalgia in it for me, i especially loved A.J Langer's character, and wish she had more screen time.
The plot is fairly simple, a new gaming system is in town, and kids are getting hooked on it. Alex, the leading lady, notices the changes in kids playing the game and tries to rescue them, but the only way to rescue them is to play the game itself. For 1993 the graphics are well done, the game is decent, the acting is okay.  I wouldn't pay too much to watch this, try watching the trailer, because i think it will give you a better idea on whether you would want to spend your money on it, for nostalgia factors it is worth it for me, but it might not be everyone's idea of a good time, even people who like notoriously bad movies. The pacing was also a bit of a let down, i wish a few more action sequences were put in.",1456704000,,880,4.057471264367816
