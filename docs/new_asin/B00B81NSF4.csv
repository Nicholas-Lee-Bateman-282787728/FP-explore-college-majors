5562402,1,B00B81NSF4,I Love pink and am a huge fan but this was a waste of money. It is basically a small biography and interviews.,1366848000,9,110,3.8260869565217392
8563822,5,B00B81NSF4,Wileys. She enjoyed it!,1472256000,,23,5.0
8563823,1,B00B81NSF4,"This DVD is very poor quality.
I was VERY disappointed when I watched it.
Trust the reviews on this one - buy another DVD.",1387584000,,122,4.125
8563824,1,B00B81NSF4,This should be taken off the market: it is just some brief interviews and hardly any music. I thought I was just seeing the trailer....,1370131200,,135,4.44
8563825,1,B00B81NSF4,"Well there is 40 minutes completely wasted!
This 'production' is as poor as I've ever seen. No wonder it's 'Unauthorized, Pink would never allow such poor quality.

There is NO MUSIC on this disc. No Concert or Video footage and the dialog is half-assed crap pulled from a couple British Radio interviews. Very Sorry Stuff.

This was a total Waste Of Money and Time!

Dont Buy This!!!!!

P.S.  We LOVE Pink (she probably hates this disc also!!!)",1369958400,,445,4.7272727272727275
8563826,1,B00B81NSF4,This is not a documentary. It just has excerpts from a couple of radio interviews and still shots of her with a voice-over of some unknown woman summarizing her career -- not even in chronological order. It is a waste of money.,1369180800,,227,4.428571428571429
8563827,1,B00B81NSF4,"This isn't even worthy to be called a DVD it's just a few interviews with snippets (1 second ) of her videos !!!!!  DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!  It's the stuff trimmed from a real DVD and thrown in the trash .......",1367884800,14,216,4.119047619047619
8563828,1,B00B81NSF4,What a waste of time and money.  Everyone else who has written a review is telling you the same thing.  Stay far away from this product.  The cover photo of P!nk even sucks!  Save your money to buy other P!nk reputable items.  I hope she puts out a DVD of her latest tour TTAL.  That would be so fantastic to watch and own.  I saw her performance and it was outstanding and an exhilarating experience.  This is the worst POS of my P!nk collection.  Can you tell I am mad that I wasted my money?!!!,1367625600,11,497,4.147368421052631
8563829,1,B00B81NSF4,"This was a real waste. Don't bother.  I wish there had been more info in the product description, no wonder it was only $9",1367366400,10,122,4.083333333333333
8563830,1,B00B81NSF4,I would've never believed it was possible to make P!nk dull if I hadn't seen it for myself. This video has all the excitement of an elementary school history movie.  Mainly consists if soundless clips from her videos with a monotoned narrator. Very disappointed.,1367193600,9,262,4.954545454545454
8563831,1,B00B81NSF4,"I am one of the biggest P!NK fans out there. However, this was a waste of money. Its very poorly put together, 3 interviews that have been played over and over again on cable. Nothing interesting. A waste of 30 minuets. I will probably never watch it again because it is, well stupid. I would never recommend this to anyone.",1366848000,4,324,4.416666666666667
