6928839,5,B00RDTNK2Q,"im tempted to drop the rating to 4 stars just because of the music. ecw originally used a lot of mainstream music. whatever rights they had for that are a thing of the past and most people's music is replaced by generic rock (likely courtesy of jim johnston). things like sandman's entrance just aren't the same. on top of the music being replaced, in that particular instance, the crowd is even edited to clear out the singing along.

thats my complaint

other than that, its a pretty good watch and a solid walk through ecw's history. i won't go into the lineup as that's been covered by someone else, but anybody that is considering this video should just go ahead and get it.",1432425600,2,679,4.512195121951219

Olympic Rules Match: Sabu vs. Cactus Jack - Cactus Jack originally had a special referee for this match to take place under amateur wrestling rules only for another man to anoint himself as the special referee under regular ECW rules as Sabu relied on his daredevil offense going aerial throughout different parts of the ring from over the top rope to a springboard position causing Cactus to resort to his hardcore antics as they traded momentum using weapons like a chair & table while sacrificing their own bodies just to hurt their opponent as this was a match that met the standards that both men are known for while telling a good story of Cactus during this stage of his career having the ""hardcore"" driven out of him.
""Holiday Hell"" Dec. '95

Rey Mysterio & 911 vs. The Eliminators - What originally started out with Joey Styles attempting to do the traditional opening of the show in the ring lead to various confrontations between not just wrestlers but other talents as well from authority figures to referees eventually leading to this match with Mysterio being able to avoid & counter the Eliminators unique athletic offense only to deliver his own lucha libre offense throughout different areas of the ring including using their own momentum against them before circumstances allowed the Eliminators to regain control with this match not only ending in a way you have to see to believe but also the bigger story being who was ultimately laid out in the ring once everything was said & done.
""House Party"" Jan. '96

Cactus Jack vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - This was ""fan cam"" footage as this match happened during a very interesting time as Cactus made it clear he was heading to the WWE & Bigelow had just came from there while Cactus had Stevie Richards & Blue Meanie in his corner as this was a pretty quick match that was more of a segment as this bigger story here was who made it clear that they wanted a piece of Bigelow.
""Just Another Night"" Feb. '96

ECW Television Champion Chris Jericho vs. Shane Douglas - Jericho was able to focus & heavily work over a part of the body in the early moments including using Shane's own momentum against him & countering his offense before Douglas was able to finally catch Jericho working on an area of the body using wrestling & taking advantage of the extreme environment as they traded momentum trading blows & countering each other as Douglas brought out a side of Jericho that hadn't really been seen in his ECW run up to this point in a competitive match.

May '97

ECW Champion Shane Douglas vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - For those who don't already know, Rick Rude had an association with Shane Douglas to provide him the best competition possible in order for him to establish himself as the greatest ECW Champion only for Rude's handpicked opponent to be Bigelow who was also a fellow member of Douglas' Triple Threat faction as Bigelow was completely dominate using his strength to easily press & toss Douglas anywhere he wanted to along with taking advantage of the fact that he knew Douglas so well to counter his signature offense while Douglas relied on leaving his feet more than we usually see him do along with desperate tactics just to take Bigelow down & keep him off his feet.

I liked how Volume 3 took a different approach compared to the previous one as we got more profiles on the characters that haven't been talked about in depth before while Richards & Meanie co-hosting lead to more fun & relaxed segments than the previous editions where they were more serious past an occasional punchline with the inclusion of promos & behind the scenes footage was a welcomed bonus while the only negative I could say is that two of the matches came off as fillers because they were more about pushing a storyline than action.

Other Blu-Ray matches include Tommy Dreamer & Cactus Jack & The Pitbulls vs. Raven & Stevie Richards & Dudley Dudley & Big Dick Dudley (WrestlePalooza '95), Rob Van Dam with Brian Pillman in his corner vs. Mikey Whipwreck (""Hardcore TV"" June '96), and ECW Television Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn (Crossing The Line '99).

I liked how Volume 3 took a different approach compared to the previous one as we got more profiles on the characters that haven't been talked about in depth before while Richards & Meanie co-hosting lead to more fun & relaxed segments than the previous editions where they were more serious past an occasional punchline with the inclusion of promos & behind the scenes footage was a welcomed bonus while the only negative I could say is that two of the matches came off as fillers because they were more about pushing a storyline than action.  In the end, it's a ECW collection that I can't deny needs to be in your collection if your a fan of the ""original"" extreme.",1432080000,8,17849,4.651443070091976

6928852,2,B00RDTNK2Q,"As a die hard ECW fan this was disappointing. Especially after I heard a rumor that this would be the last ECW release by the WWE, not sure if true or not though. It gets off on a bad start by being co-hosted by the bwo, fat Meanie & no talent Stevie Richards. Malenko vs Scorpio & Douglas vs Simmons were interesting just because I hadn't seen them before but Douglas vs Simmons was bad with a lame ending. Malenko vs Scorpio had some decent spots but overall just wasn't that good. Cactus vs Bigelow was bad. Mysterio & 911 vs The Eliminators was a waste of time. The Double Jeopardy Match sucked butt, as did Taz vs Tajeri (Taz acting very out of charcter in this match) So...any highlights??? Douglas vs Bigelow was decent if for no other reason to hear Rick Rude's banter with the fans. Jericho vs Douglas was decent. The return of Raven was a big moment I remember. The best match had to be EZ Money vs Kid Kash. I ""rented"" this DVD from the library & am super glad I didn't pay for it.",1434931200,,992,4.226315789473684
