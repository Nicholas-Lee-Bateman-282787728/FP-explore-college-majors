Special Bonus
In 1985, Republican Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater and Democrat Arizona Congressman Morris Udall shared a stage before The Arizona Capitol Hill Club - perhaps three hundred Arizonans employed in Washington by our state`s congressional delegation.. Both men came from pioneer families; had served the state and nation in war and peace; and had been candidates for President of the United States. Rather than a serious discussion of contemporary-1985 political issues, these two Elder Statesmen engaged in a delightful, very humorous conversation about the connections between their families, Arizona history, and their unsuccessful races for the White House.
