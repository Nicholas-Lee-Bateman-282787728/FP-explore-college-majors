7996999,4,B0000AGQ2O,"Though I was not around to see the Ed Sullivan show, I've seen the reruns and the specials on Nick at Night and TV Land.  It always intrigued me to see Jim Henson and the Muppets appear - not your usual Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo - no no no.  These creatures were much stranger, much more unique, much more interesting.
On this DVD are almost all of the appearances (a few had to be left out due to music liscence problems) in great quality, and 5.1 sound.  These appearances include such wonderful skits such as:
""The Glutton"" (where a rather fat man eats everything in site, then is eaten himself by a much larger version of himself)
""A Change of face"" (where a puppet changes his attitude, age, and voice by having someone rearrange and change his face)
and
""The Computer Dinner"" (where a monster who looks much like Cookie Monster eats a giant super computer peice by peice, only to find out that no matter what you do to the computer, nothing can prevent it from performing it's primary function - to be the most powerful explosive device in the world).
These skits are creative, well done, and most of all lots of fun to watch.  And for a price this low, how can you go wrong?  If you're not a Muppet fan, this DVD may not interest you as much as it did me, but if you like them, this will surely be a great addition to your collection.",1063497600,2,1340,4.322709163346613
