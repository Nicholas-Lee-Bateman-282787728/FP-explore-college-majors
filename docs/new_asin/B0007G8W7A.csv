8545188,5,B0007G8W7A,"The DVD is excellent for young children and adults learning basic ASL.  The instructor is very pleasant and knowledgeable.  The viewer will learn to sign the ABC's and some basic signing, and then experience a trip to zoo to practice several animal signs while seeing some of their favorite animals.  After visiting the zoo, the instructor uses fingerspelling for each animal and the viewer has a chance to practice fingerspelling. Finally, the signs for 1-20 are presented.  In the end, one learns without realizing it.  The experience is fun and the learning is easy.

This DVD can be used for very young children (even toddlers 1 year and up), who are likely to find the signs fun and the learning easy. One doesn't have to be hearing impaired to learn ASL or to have fun communication this sign and gesture based language.",1190592000,,826,4.78169014084507
