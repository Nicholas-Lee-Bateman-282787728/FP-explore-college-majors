Certainly not in the large cover stories and films  of WW ll events. I enjoyed it very much.  I liked the presentation. Gives validity to the recounted stories.",1505260800,,289,4.627450980392157
8398729,5,B003KK5ASE,"Dear Readers:

This is a wonderful documentary about Anti-Nazi Resistance in Ukraine. This film was created by a family of 3 (Father, Mother and Son) in their Living Room! They poured heart and soul to share true stories about those Brave Resistance Fighters.

This is a very important film about untold history of Ukraine. Today, many people are actively looking about WWII stories in former Soviet Union. This documentary helps them to learn about wonderful people who fought evil Nazis.

I disagree with the 1-star reviewers. They probably have a personal vendetta to destroy this important movie.",1483056000,,600,5.164948453608248
8398730,5,B003KK5ASE,"This production cuts through the clouds of speculation  about  the resistance  in the Ukraine....It does present to the viewer the eye opening struggles by so few to rid the world of a monster.....I've studied WW 2 in the East at University and I must say,this was an eye opener....well done !!",1479600000,,294,4.7254901960784315
8398731,1,B003KK5ASE,"This is apparently a homemade effort to tell an important story, but the message is completely lost in the shoddiness of the production. I understand this is a family effort and for them, a labor of love. But e-gad! This is awful.

This film is composed of interviews with a sincere, but indecipherable gentleman, interspersed with stock footage and stills, and the most abominable computer generated stuff imaginable. The interviewer is the wife of the gentleman, and her voice is the most unfortunate thing in the movie. It is...there's no nice way to say it, just plain shrill and ghastly, fingernails on chalkboard. She is stiff and stilted, and we just never can warm up to her. The narrative is completely lost in the overpowering accent of the gentleman telling the story. The CGI stuff is amateurish and distracting. The musical segues between scenes are jarring and abrupt.

Inexplicably, the film starts with an accusation - weren't the Ukrainian resistance fighters criminals? The film gets off completely on the wrong foot because of this approach - an hour of justification and explanations to demonstrate these people were NOT criminals but rather heroes. Why not just START with that assumption and let the story tell itself?

This could have been so much better with the gentleman and lady asking and answering questions in their own language with an interpreter voicing over. Captions would have been immensely helpful. If I could have understood any of the words that were said, I could have forgiven some of the errors, but it was completely unintelligible, which magnified my annoyance at the amateurish mistakes. You simply can not get past the shoddiness to appreciate any aspect of the effort.

There's a reason why people go to film school. This is a good example of what NOT to do.

It's possible to make a good film on a small budget, but it's unlikely it will happen ""in house."" The film would benefit from swapping mom out for a professional journalist to interview dad. Captions or an interpretor, and an experienced special effects craftsman are desperately needed. A good editor could have made better use of the stock footage and stills that are used. Very little context was provided for the viewer. There's so much wrong and so little right that there is no incentive to expend the huge effort it takes to sit through this mess to hear the story.

Obviously it was important enough to this family that the film be made. That they all pitched in and invested themselves in the production shows their commitment to getting it done. But with a story of that importance, why would you ever waste so much time and effort an a DIY project instead of making sure you got it right? We WANT to hear stories such as this. But not this way.

Not everyone can pull off making a worthwhile film. There's no shame in utilizing outside professionals to tell a family's story. This story should be told in a way it can be appreciated. Please enlist professionals to re-work this project into something more acceptable.",1387929600,2,3036,4.826923076923077
8398732,1,B003KK5ASE,"Subject matter is interesting, but delivery style is horrible.  Film did not seem to be edited, or at least not well.  Script is repetitive, and interviewer is like a deer in headlights.  Would have made a better book, special effects are also rather poor and the film moves rather slowly, especially when questions are being asked.  Film desperately needed a better script to keep the attention of the viewers who are not related to the pair.",1344902400,,443,4.7894736842105265
8398733,5,B003KK5ASE,"This is an excellent investment of 30 minutes of your time and a few dollars if you want to know about what the people near Germany went through during WW II.  The stories are well and accurately told.  They bring back memories of my childhood when my parents and my aunt and uncle talked about their WW II experiences as German civilians.  My father was a civilian who also fought with the Marquis and would have been in a concentration camp if the war lasted two more weeks.  I just wish I had movies of my family stories to share.  I know the pain and hatred all victims of the Nazis share.  The Nuremberg trials did not eradicate all the Nazi vermin, many my father swore to kill were re-assimilated.  It took him 20 years before he could again set foot in Germany.  I admire the adherence to fact, forced calmness, and lack of anger and hatred shown in RESCUE STORIES.",1278460800,6,873,4.37888198757764
8398734,1,B003KK5ASE,"It's awful.  I had high expectations, and was vv disappointed.  It was difficult to understand the heavy accent of the narrator.  It did not tell me very much at all.  it was a grand waste of money and time.",1278201600,3,207,4.230769230769231
