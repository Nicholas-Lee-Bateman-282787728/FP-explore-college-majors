6605215,5,B00N1G0QPO,I'm a huge Tony Goldwyn fan so I have all of his works! Just added this one to it.,1415318400,,82,3.3684210526315788
6605216,2,B00N1G0QPO,"The romanticized vision of the malevolant cult leader brainwashing thousands of believers to do his bidding is an exciting concept.  It is the closest we will ever be to a real life supervillian.  It goes to wonder how the creators of this movie ruined such a softball biopic of Warren Jeffs' life.

The main problem I had with this movie is the low cost production values put into it.  I did not watch this on television, but from the very first 30 seconds I could tell you that it was a made for TV movie.  The black and white character, the hastely created script, and the overly dramatized music made me want to roll my eyes as this movie tries too hard to be something that it is not.  The outragous music and sidways camera shots as Jeffs falls into madness were more remenicent of the 1966 Batman movie than a DVD created in 2014.

There are large portions of the movie that are just outright hard to understand what is going on.  I know Warren Jeffs is a crazy man but this movie does not do a good enough job outlining the logic behind the craziness.  There are multiple scenes where Jeffs punishes members of his congregation for various things they have done to upset him but the movie does not explain exactly what these people actually did to deserve his wrath.  It feels that the movie is just asking the audience to trust that Jeffs is illogical and therefore the scenes are logical.

The most redeeming feature of this movie are the actors themselves.  They were given lemons and they made lemonade.  The actor that played Jeffs did a fantastic job portraying the unsound man as he falls deeper and deeper into insanity.",1413936000,5,1636,4.505084745762712
6605217,3,B00N1G0QPO,"This is a Lifetime movie. I think thats the best summary of the movie. If you know what a Lifetime movie is, you know what Im talking about. This is a based on a true story, and per the credits based on the book When Men Become Gods. I have not read the book and I only vaguely familiar with what happened out there; this movie did nothing to increase my knowledge of the events.

Warren Jeffs became the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) after his father, Rulon Jeffs, passes away. Rulon, a man with 56 wives and prophetic dreams, does not like to be questioned and does not seem to like his son, Warren. Their difficult relationship is only briefly mentioned in the latter part of the movie and is not shown initially to explain Warrens outbursts or weird behavior.

In the beginning Warren seems to only have one wife. Im not sure what her name is because they don't talk about that too much. Shes there, they mention shes the first wife, but there is no backstory of how they met or even if they actually care for each other. When hes having trouble addressing a crowd they look at each other and I thought that maybe she gave him strength to find the words to pull the crowd to him, but by the end of the movie I am wondering if I just decided that to help it make sense to me. I cant make up my mind about her because her actions aren't clear to me. Is she doing this because she really believes hes the prophet? Is she doing this because she loves him? Does she even think hes the prophet? Does she even love him?

Most of the movie didn't make sense to me in the same way. The choices and the motivations are not explained. Im not sure why twice they show him rubbing his fingers together. This may be a nervous tick he has but its never explained and you don't see it but the two times its shown close up.  When they have the forced wedding and say Shes as ready as shes going to be its not clear what happened. Did they drug her? Did they explain to her she had no option and she finally gave in? When actors portray emotion on their face, I cant tell what they're going for and felt that maybe they weren't sure exactly either. Everyone seemed passionate for whatever reason though.

The movie was entertaining and Tony Goldwyn (Ghost, Scandal) is always excellent in a fiery role but I think this movie overreached and in the ends only feeling like half a story.",1413936000,4,2420,4.286652078774617
6605218,3,B00N1G0QPO,"This is the latest Lifetime type film offered up at Redbox. Based on a true story the film opens with Warren Jeffs (Tony Goldwyn) running from the police. We then jump to 4 years earlier where we see his rise to power as it portrays the FLDS community as polygamists, perverts and child rapists...following God's will as stated by the polygamists, perverts, and child rapists.

After an hour we get to the point where we started, followed by 20 minutes of chase and ten minutes of court and jail time.

The characters in the film are one dimensional and cardboard, perhaps by design but it makes it tough to sit through. It was nice to see Martin Landau still alive, but when you are type cast into roles where you are old and die...

The movie makes the prophet idea look bad and is perhaps the left wing answer to ""Mitt"" which made him look like a regular guy. It would have been more interesting if they exposed main stream Mormon beliefs other than the ""Highest honor for a woman is to be a mother."" I want to hear more about becoming a God, getting your own planet and having your wife (s) push out babies to populate it. What would Freud say about that male fantasy.

The film has no swearing. The nudity on the DVD cover is indeed in the film, although what classifies as nudity for TV in the U.S. is not in the film...i.e. you don't get much more than what is on the cover. The production does show Warren having sex with a young girl while the rest of his nude wives watch. He introduces God into the bedroom in a way that I found darkly comical with one girl repeating, ""I feel God within you Uncle Warren"" while they have sex.

Oh yes girl/girl action seems to be okay in the bedroom as long as they are not lesbians.

And in case you haven't figured it out, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

6605219,4,B00N1G0QPO,"This could have gone further into depth on another network, but for what it is, this film is a good exploration of the notorious, power mad Jeffs, who deluded himself and his followers. A good warning about religious power corrupting.",1412726400,2,234,4.875
6605220,3,B00N1G0QPO,"So it was an OK movie, it kind of glitches and was way to dark in some parts. And sometimes the people speaking would be cut off. But other than that it was an interesting look into an example of polygamy.",1473465600,,205,4.024390243902439
6605221,5,B00N1G0QPO,I found this movie to be a pretty accurate depiction of what was going on in Utah a few years ago.,1472860800,,98,3.7142857142857144
6605222,3,B00N1G0QPO,"I don't feel the story was properly developed and focused on the sexual aspects too much. We he had many wives, but what was there lives really like? I was more interested in seeing that..",1472428800,2,188,4.4
6605223,5,B00N1G0QPO,"Really interesting and sexual. My boyfriend and I watched this together, and we both enjoyed it. It is a little bit sexually twisted and surprising.",1468713600,,148,4.96
6605224,1,B00N1G0QPO,Thought it was a documentary not a movie.,1466812800,,41,4.25
6605225,2,B00N1G0QPO,"This movie is a quick rundown into the life of Warren Jeffs and his followers. To get more of an understanding to some of the key characters the movie focuses on, I would recommend reading Stolen Innocence by Elissa Wall (the 14 year old bride) and The Witness Wore Red by Rebecca Musser (the woman who was refusing to be with Warren).
It is slow paced and at times hard to understand what's taking place. There are moments when it's hard to watch the horror some of these women faced.",1464220800,,485,4.4
6605226,4,B00N1G0QPO,"Good movie.  Really sad subject matter.  I love David Keith, he's a wonderful actor and it's so nice to see him here.  Feel so sorry for those women.

Spoiler Alert:  My favorite line was when David said to Warren, ""I think that you still believe...""
Tony Goldwyn's breakdown in the prison felt so real.  It seemed as though Warren has finally confronted the truth ""I am not the Prophet and never was"" and found it unbearable to live with.",1463443200,,439,4.493670886075949

6605231,1,B00N1G0QPO,"Completely ridiculous movie. It's not at all representative of the actual events, based on flds cult escapee stories. It wasn't even entertaining. Even for a lifetime movie, this one was over the top. Don't waste your money.",1443139200,2,224,5.081081081081081
6605232,5,B00N1G0QPO,"Tony Goldwyn, is a very versatile actor. The various roles he has played puts him at the top with other sought after actors & directors.",1442016000,,136,4.48
6605233,2,B00N1G0QPO,People that are uninformed about the Mormon church should not associate us with these fundamentalist. The FLDS church has never been associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If you have questions ask.,1440374400,2,224,5.25

6605239,3,B00N1G0QPO,This was a good movie but it seems a lot was missing or had to be taken out (seemed to skip over a lot of parts and I kept waiting for dome of the parts to referenced back to know how someone ended up in another place or situation) for the made for television viewing.,1418169600,2,268,3.890909090909091

8675574,1,B00N1G0QPO,"I haven't watched this movie, and I have no desire to watch it. What little I've learned of it through the ""trailer"" and these pathetically misinformed and ignorant comments was more than enough. It is as far from being the ""true story"" about Warren Jeffs and the FLDS people as hell is from heaven. But who really wants to know the truth, when lies are so prevalent and captivating? The truth doesn't sell sensational books and movies or make international headlines. But it will still prevail, nevertheless. There are three very important key witnesses who KNOW that Warren Jeffs is pure and innocent of any wrongdoing. They are God, satan, and Warren Jeffs. But there are others, too, and there comes a time when the whole world will know and acknowledge it, whether they want to or not. God bless the honest in heart everywhere, who recognize this movie and the many books, videos, and news articles like it for what they really are: hellish lies designed to destroy one of the best men who ever lived, and to destroy his family and people along with him. --One More Who Knows",1517443200,,1080,4.659685863874346

8675576,2,B00N1G0QPO,"I watched this movie at the suggestion of one of my friends.  They simply wanted my opinion before they gave me theirs.  I know quite a bit about Warren Jeffs (as my friend already knew) so what I saw was not really much of a surprise to be honest.  The first time I watched it was simply for the entertainment aspect.  If failed miserably in this department.  The second time I watched it was for the accuracy of actual events.  At least that part was better.  But overall, most people watch movies to be entertained, and this one won't do that.  Read the back cover of the DVD case as that's all the entertainment you'll get.",1507334400,,627,4.344827586206897

8675578,2,B00N1G0QPO,"I got really interested in the mormon cults a while ago, and have watched a lot of films, tv shows and documentary on the subject matter. This movie interpretation isn't great. Like another reviewer said, it focuses a lot on the sexual aspects and it seems like it was meant to titilate... which is kind of messed up considering that Warren Jeffs and his religious sect were responsible for the sexual abuse and rape of thousands of underage girls. It's not a ""sexy"" situation. A better portrayal on the same subject matter is the reality tv show Escaping Polygamy, which centers on three women who were able to escape and are committed to helping others do the same.",1495584000,3,667,4.661016949152542
