2152048,4,B0002Z7RNG,"Miike has directed a descent into a surreal nightmare with Gozu.  I applaud him for his brave effort because it will probably be loved or hated, maybe never fully understood.  It isn't the most linear of films, but that's one of the things that makes it different.  Art is subjective and one should make up their own mind sometimes instead of having everything spoon fed.  Of course if you understand how Miike as a director enjoys leaving the interpretation open, then you might get this more.  It deals with subjects like lactation, incest, cross dressing, homosexuality, and ladle love-oh boy, in ways one might not expect.  It isn't an action packed fast paced flick so be prepared to ponder...",1105574400,,698,4.823529411764706
2152049,4,B0002Z7RNG,"So, as the headline suggests, I love Gozu and find it to be my favorite Takashi Miike film so far. So many others have written about it that I won't bother trying to summarize the plot (which is more or less wide open to interpretation anyway). Suffice it to say I saw it at the theater a couple months back and after it was finished left the cinema utterly DAZED. Which is why the DVD is such a disappointment. As I said, the film itself is awesome BUT for one thing the disc's packaging promises that it's letterboxed. Unfortunately it actually isn't and as, someone who saw it in the theater, I can tell you that the lack of letterboxing really hurts the film at several points- for a perfect (and very early) example, the soon-to-be-infamous-if-it-isn't-already opening ""yakuza dog"" sequence. Also, chapter stops are nice if, oh, say my phone or doorbell rings while I'm watching the film and I have to stop it (my DVD player will turn off completely if left idle for something like 15 minutes so...); unfortunately there aren't chapter selections either. Geez, was this thing rushed out for Christmas or what?! Some imminently quotable lines in here and the DVD has a couple hilariously vague interviews with Miike (""Gozu is how a child looks at the world..."" etc. WHAT?!) but overall this film deserves a lot better and I've never before encountered DVD packaging that was inaccurate like this.",1102809600,4,1400,4.741803278688525
2152050,5,B0002Z7RNG,"Takashi Miike's Gozu is anything but a normal cinematic experience. To put it into words that you may or may not understand, think of films by David Lynch and David Cronenburg. Gozu is just that -- surreal, intangible, grotesque, and unconventional.

If that is something you enjoy, then you may want to check Gozu out. On the other hand, if you want a film that gives you an accessible storyline I suggest you look elsewhere. Gozu is not a movie that can be fully understood. It is all left open to interpretation, like Lynch's films, because it denies reality in favor of subtly and downright outrageousness. You will not believe what you are seeing on screen, which is the very reason why this movie is not for the average Joe. For many people, they will just not understand what makes this movie great. It is not understanding it, but going on a journey through a bizarre world with bizarre characters that makes it worthwhile. There has never been more beauty in getting lost in your own dreams and nightmares, fears and fantasies, and so on. Too many movies are black and white. They want to give you a linear storyline that is easy to digest. This is the type of movie where you can always discover something new within it each time you watch it again. Or a movie where you can sit around with your friends and discuss the meaning behind it. In other words, this movie has no meaning, but you can attach your own personal meaning to it (like Lynch's movies) that is neither right nor wrong. Not many movies are daring enough to do this, but Gozu is one of them, and if you enjoy that type of movie then check it out.

Takashi Miike is well known for making ""shocking"" movies. Gozu is no exception. In Gozu's case, he creates shocking, visceral scenes that completely deny palpability. Gozu will either shock you, make you laugh out loud, or bore you. Personally, I did not find this movie shocking. It is not any worse than Ichi the Killer, which did not shock me either. Instead, it made me laugh out loud because it was obviously a black comedy. But, that is besides the point. Some of the more shocking scenes in this movie are quite funny, too. I don't know, maybe it is just me. I do not find Miike's movies shocking. Gozu is only disturbing because it is hard to understand. It is a subjective experience that completely twists our banal world into a grotesque nightmare. If you are expecting shoot outs, violence, and gore this is not the movie.

Gozu places an emphasis on aesthetic beauty and brutality. There is scenery in this film of the rural side of Japan that is breathtaking. The town where most of the movie takes place is also quite nice. It looks like a common town in Japan. I do not know for sure, since I have never been to Japan, but I am quite positive that this town is supposed to look like an any-town-Japan. Gozu takes place in a very mundane and ordinary setting. The point is that there are bizarre happenings existing underneath the surface of this town.

Anyway, Gozu is a ""Yakuza Horror"" film. The film mostly follows the story of a man who is searching for his brother in a bizarre town. While he is in this town, he meets some ""very"" bizarre characters. These people are definitely not normal small town folk. I would go on with my plot description, but it is quite pointless indeed. Gozu is a movie that you just have to see for yourself. It is no Audition or Ichi the Killer; Gozu stands alone as being something different for Takashi Miike, and the movie is a breath of fresh air for the Japanese Yakuza genre. See it.",1101945600,3,3563,4.476923076923077
2152051,5,B0002Z7RNG,"So good I can't even begin to tell you.  A new favorite.  Miike's best film I have seen so far.  An imaginative achievement.  Not for the faint of heart and most definitely not for children or anyone under the age of eighteen.  This is a hard ""R"".  There are at least six classic scenes in this film.  Haunting, beautiful and terrifying entertaiment.",1100995200,3,350,4.548387096774194
2152052,5,B0002Z7RNG,"One of the best movies ever imho.
I wouldn't expect it to make complete sense; I understood it best as ""modern art..""  I think it's fair to say that it is deliberately surreal.  Wow, what fantastic goings-on.  The feel of this movie I felt was David Lynch-y, for sure.  Some of what's in store for you:  the mob boss who can only get off with a ladle in his butt, the woman hotel proprieter that offers her [vital organ] to main character protagonist (and who also feeds her own brother in this manner) and is very dissapointed when he declines, the very odd townfolk in general, the rebirth of a full grown man.
It is supposed to be mystery, and the solution to the mystery is even more mysterious.  I think this movie is absolutely fantastic.  The imagery and style are very interesting throughout and the conclusion of the movie still makes me giggle when I think about it.",1099094400,6,876,4.471698113207547
2152053,4,B0002Z7RNG,"Sometime's I think Miike comes up with one incredible scene and then builds an entire movie around it. It is amazing he can create this scene with such an obvious low budget. I must say though, this scene is worth the price of admission.  The movie does not make alot of sense and it is uneven. I love Miike movies and this is as twisted as it gets.",1097539200,5,349,4.132352941176471
2152054,5,B0002Z7RNG,"I watched this, because it showed up on David Lynch pages as related.  It's clear that the reviewers either have a temperament to like this or not.  IT'S DEFINITELY WEIRD!  I think it's artfully weird.  I think it makes David Lynch look like a child with his silly little Inland Empire and Eraserhead.  This is Lynch in Japanese and on steroids.  All I can say is that if you like surreal and non-linear movies by directors like David Lynch, you will probably consider this as the ultimate standard for that genre.

If you need a nice little conventional story, you will probably hate this and shut it off shortly after it starts.

I tell you, this makes me look at the Japanese in a different light.  Then again, when you consider the kamikaze and the bataan death march, it makes perfect sense.  There is a dark side to the Japanese, and this is one of the darkest, murderous quality comedies I've ever seen.",1486166400,2,910,4.52760736196319

2152082,1,B0002Z7RNG,"I happen to like Takashi Miike. I would rank Ichi The Killer as one of my top movies, and first discovered him in Audition. I liked the ambiguity he presented in some of his shorts, like in Masters of Horror' Imprint and Box. While not a die hard fan of Japanese horror, (which could explain the reason why I did not get a lot of this) but this film left me disappointed. While the entire film is steeped in black comedy, rather nightmarish imagery (in terms of gore, Miike is restrained in this one, though the gross out factor was high, and I did not like it at all) and is solely left open to interpretation based on the viewer, some of the more revolting aspects present in the film were simply a turn off to me and it seemed just ridiculous.

Granted, films like Ichi were filled with ten times more brutality, shock value and gore, yet it somehow worked for me in context with the plot of the film. For me, I just felt this was a lot of toilet humor where each scene tried to outdo the last.

I do not deny that Miike is a great film maker, and I would still tune into a film solely because of his name attached to it. But to me, this one simply missed the mark.",1483401600,,1168,4.140969162995595

2152094,4,B0002Z7RNG,"Gozu by Takashi Miike is a film that you will constantly think about while simultaneously, with what is left of your sanity, try to forget lest you be thrown in an insane asylum. The same feeling stirred in me the first time I watched David Lynch's Eraserhead. Gozu, like Eraserhead, is a sort of nightmare. Lynch, when he's not forecasting L.A. weather, (does he still do that?) describes his films as ""an idea,"" and I believe that is what Miike is going for in his film. Upon my viewing, the themes are not made obvious. I was too enraptured by the sheer craziness and confusion. Although, during the end credits song, you can hear ""no sex"" being chanted (at least, I think that is what is being said) so, maybe, the idea of abstaining from sex, or, specifically, taboo sex might be the overall theme.
Gozu evokes a range of emotions, some that may trigger laughter, horror or even frustration. With that said, it is worth persevering through, not to say that it is a chore to watch since the performances by the actors are great and the range of seriousness and offbeat comedic timing at which they perform results in a film where anything can happen, and does. Considering the film runs over 2 hours, Gozu does reward you with an ending that is quite the payoff. It is unlike anything I have ever seen. I will not spoil it no matter how late you or I are to the party (Gozu was released in 2003. I watched it for the first time in 2016).
It would be difficult for me to recommend this movie. I doubt that I would even strike up a conversation with someone about it, even if I overheard them discussing it with some bewildered individual trying to make sense of it all. My two cents would not go pass, Yeah, Gozu. Crazy, right? What the hell was that about?

A mob underling is tasked with getting rid of his crazy boss.  Then on the way to the 'dump' where the mob gets rid of its own.

Gozu is a wtf movie because this is what you'll be saying throughout the film. Completely outrageous, totally off-the-chain, the director Tarantino aspires to be. The premise of the film is simple: a Yakuza is ordered to off his mentor but reconsiders. Mentor mysteriously disappears wherein a series of strange characters, particularly one who's literally half albino, leads young Yakuza to a hotel whose owner holds the key to locating mentor. This is one weird hotel. The situations young Yakuza finds himself in here are nothing compared with what's happened to his boss. You'd never believe it and I'd sound like a pervert trying to describe it but you have to see it for yourself. Truly one of the best wtf films of Miike's who has since, IMO, lost his edge.

They get to the town and the nut-case brother disappears. The hunt is on and the somewhat sane brother is in for one wild ride as he runs into an assortment of increasingly oddball characters and situations.

Movies that are weird for weird's sake rarely appeal to me because they are generally disjointed and the weirdness has no purpose. Here though, there seems to be some sense to it all. I can't even say that I understood it but it all hangs together somehow. I believe one of the other viewers mentioned how, if you pay close attention, it will make sense in the end. Well then, maybe I need to watch it again. I didn't get it but there did seem to be some odd logic in motion. It's almost like a dream. It moves under it's own weight.

2152136,4,B0002Z7RNG,"Takashi Miike is a very inexhaustible and prolific director; the man has directed many different films in different genres that I believe that he is one of the most versatile filmmakers around. He is also arguably one of the most darkly audacious director in contemporary Japanese cinema. ""GOZU"" (a.k.a. ""Cow-head"", Gokudo Kyofu Dai-gekijo: Gozu, 2003) is arguably one of his most mystifying, wanton, provocative and demented displays of Miike's imagination. Miike re-teams with Sachiko Sato, who adapted ""Ichi The Killer"" for him. Miike seems to be drawn to the Yakuza gangster themes but believe me when I say that ""Gozu"" is anything but your standard Yakuza film. I've always said that the best way to approach Miike's films is to have no expectations and the less that you know, the better. The reward into Miike's films is the journey itself.

Minami (Hideki Sone) is a member of the Azamawari Yakuza crew. He highly respects his Aniki (brother) Ozaki (Sho Aikawa) to whom he is greatly indebted to for his life. However, when Ozaki becomes paranoid and eccentrically imbalanced, Minami is asked by their elder (Renji Ishibashi), to escort him to the yakuza dumping site in Nogoya, Minami becomes torn between his loyalty to Ozaki and following the orders of their boss; but instead Ozaki appears to peg out in the car as soon as they approach their destination and to make matters worst, the corpse goes missing. Now in his quest to authenticate Ozaki`s death, Minami must find the body; this quest brings him to a nightmarish journey that brings him face to face with several creepy characters from a transvestite restaurant owner (cameo by its writer Sato himself), to Nose, a man with a skin condition (played by Shohei Hino), to a hyper-lactating woman (Keiko Tomita) and her brother (Harumi Sone), a demonic half-human half cow, and mysterious beautiful woman called Sakiko (sexy Yoshino Kamiya).

Takashi Miike begins his film as an offbeat goofy yakuza film and he plays havoc with the gangster stereotypes. The film also starts off a little slow, actually a little less trite and more bizarrely eventful than the romantic trappings of ""Audition"". While ""Gozu's"" payoff may not be as brutal as in that earlier film, ""Gozu"" is nonetheless very visceral and the manner in which it sears your brain is still similar to being scorched by fire. ""Gozu"" is one very mystifying affair, its mind-bending qualities may just equal or even exceed the films made by Cronenberg and Lynch. For the viewer to truly appreciate this film, one has to understand a little bit about the beliefs in Buddhism. The film has several Buddhist themes such as the cow-headed human (Gozu is the guardian of Buddhist Hell), beliefs in reincarnation and in Karma and different inner personalities. I know the film may make a lot of people scratch their heads and honestly some parts of the film doesn't really cohere but Miike manages to keep its focus, giving the viewer sketches of his imagination and generates a darkly surreal atmosphere that exudes a feeling that something sinister, shocking and eerie is about to be revealed.

There is no doubt that Miike is a master of visuals of strong composition, body-horror and squirm-inducing sexual weirdness that he isn`t at all shy to demonstrate in his films. He is also capable of the cogent dissemination of ideas and is capable of great humor. He has this brilliant skill in subverting genre techniques in exploring an ugly facet of his culture, that taps into deep seated cultural anxieties; in essence, male sexual anxiety that no other filmmaker can equal. ""Gozu"" may just be as twisted as ""Visitor Q"" and the characters may even be more bizarre in this film. Miike also displays human behavior in this film, and as usual it is bewildering and very weird. The script by Sato never relents as he throws in every twisted, darkly satiric idea that can come to mind, that between him and Miike, they come up with ideas that become more and more grotesque the more you get into the film. ""Gozu"" may show subtle qualities of a dark comedy, but never for one second does it stray from its horrific tone.

The characters in the film are very intriguing as we become privy to Azamawari, the gang boss who has a fetish with spatulas while having sex, Ozaki who in the film's opening act kills a Chihuahua who he says is a yakuza attack dog (don't worry the dog is fake), Minami who had just recently been circumcised, a woman who lactates milk and may have an incestuous relationship with her brother; the film has all the dark elements of a comedy. Throw in some homosexual panic, a trans-gendered reincarnation and a disquieting rebirth sequence (that may well be the most graphically shocking scene in cinema) and the movie can just entice as well as unsettle its intended viewers. There may be some borrowings in the film but the style and the graphic scenes carries the absolute Takashi Miike signature. It is Miike's and his alone.

""Gozu"" is a film with a warped-out story. But it sure helps when you have can squeeze out some very good performances from the actors. Miike just encourages his performers to portray his characters by feeling `natural'; it is a bold approach that complements his visual style. Bold, daring and demented, ""Gozu"" is all that its title suggests. It is a risky and brilliantly executed, Miike is able to repeat his compelling and repelling effect that he has demonstrated in most of his films. Much like in ""Audition"" and ""Visitor Q"", Takashi Miike gives us one of the most memorably graphic scene of a climactic rebirth that will forever be etched in my brain. It is not a film for everyone but ""Gozu"" is one of Miike's best films.

Highly Recommended! [4+ Stars]",1255305600,3,5729,4.834862385321101
2152137,4,B0002Z7RNG,"Let's just say that if you're familiar with Takashi Miike's previous work like Ichi the Killer, Audition, and the banned from TV Masters of Horror episode, ""Imprint,"" that Gozu fits in quite well with Miike's reputation. Gozu reels you in with the opening scene and then seems to snowball as the film goes on. It seems to dawdle through its duration as its weird individuals and events begin to pile up. A particular scene from The Shining ran through my mind throughout the film. The scene where you see a man getting oral sex from somebody in a bear costume just ran through my head constantly while Gozu was playing. That scene is pretty much a perfect euphemism for Gozu. That specific scene in The Shining was bizarre and disturbing while Gozu is bizarre and disturbing from the opening minutes of the film until the credits roll.

This is also the second film of Miike's involving breast milk that I've had the pleasure of seeing. He must associate that with weirdness or something, which it is. It's not necessarily something that sounds appealing, but once it starts happening it winds up being too horrifying and too unusual to turn away from. Seeing how far Miike is willing to push ideas in his films is one of the reasons people find his films enjoyable. That and originality. Despite the strangeness found in his films, finding something similar to his work is practically impossible. Originality is something that should be cherished when it's found in someone's work, but maybe that's just a personal opinion.

It's hard to label Gozu as a specific genre as it has elements from just about every genre that comes to mind. A dramatic horror with a little bit of mystery thrown in for good measure is the best I can do. The film is definitely a unique trip that definitely isn't for everyone. The most bizarre ideas roaming around in your brain right now probably don't compare to the last twenty or so minutes of Gozu. The events that unfold during that time are pretty jawdropping. So if you're a Miike fan or are looking for something incredibly different (I'm talking way out there), then this comes highly recommended. There is no way that everyone who views this film enjoy it, but the ending is incredibly memorable if the viewer can make it that far.",1244937600,3,2271,4.703517587939698
2152138,5,B0002Z7RNG,"See a woman give birth to a full grown man while she's having sex....See a creepy old lady lactate her milk all over the place(Yeesshhh!!!!)See tailor made suits of human bodies with the organs still intact. See a cow-headed demon(creepy as hell!)and other sick and twisted oddities. Besides the shock factor that Miike provides for us he has an underlying message about sex,violence,chaos and a nightmare that takes place in left field some where. The most bizarre and ominous for me are the scenes with the cowman and the poor little yapping puppy that gets stomped on. For whatever reason it had me thinking about the relation we as humans have to animals,along with the relationship we share together living on the same planet. The cow-headed demon(or goat head?) that has always been a symbol of evil in history connects some how with the giving of new life to a dead yakuza boss,born again fully grown along with the killing of a helpless puppy. Where do the human suits come in(shedding of old skin maybe)?Everthing here connects perhaps?Perhaps many would think Miike is only putting this out there for shock factor,but these ideas still have to come from somewhere inside the mind of Takashi Miike. The point is that these images here on the screen mean something. I'm just not sure what. I very much enjoyed this film and appreciate Miike's strangness.

2152139,5,B0002Z7RNG,"As strange and twisted as this movie is, it manages to be completely surreal, and at times subtle. it was a crazy experience to say the least.

The second full-length Takashi Miike movie ive seen, ""Ichi The Killer"" being the only other. i was surprised with the overall package here. theres only one scene you could really constitute as violence, and even that is pretty hilarious in its own way. this one is out there, even for Miike. i don't want to list too much of the oddities, as thats already been done very heavily (reading them took some of the fun out of this movie for me) ill just say ive seen ichi 3 times and imprint twice, and his movie had me scratching my head in awe and confusion many times.

things start off looking like a yakuza film, but the tide turns fast as the main character is charged with killing his superior.. and best friend. early into the movie his friend disappears out of nowhere, and thus begins the search.. and an excellent journey into what may be another realm (nothing is really explained, which may put off some viewers, but i think it all just added to the intrique)

good camera work(some scenes are excellently atmospheric) lots of good laughs, although you may wander why your laughing, and a story that'll keep you guessing long after the credits(i still am)

you'll have the best experience with this movie if you just go ahead and watch it. don't read the spoilers in many reviews on here, i cant imagine how great this would've been if i hadnt known what was going to happen.

Ultimately, however, I was frustrated by it because it seemed to be strange simply for the sake of being strange.  I don't need every film to have a tidy resolution, but the art of ambiguity lies in communicating the sense that there is an underlying logic to events, even if we cannot see it right now.

2152143,2,B0002Z7RNG,"Simply said, Yakuza Horror Theater isn't for everyone -- particularly in the case of Gozu, which draws heavily from the influences of gangster cinema, art house horror, and the midnight movies of the 70's and 80's. Fans of Cronenberg and Lynch are bound to take an interest; yet, where they succeed in addressing themes such as interchangability and exclusivity, Miike tends to abandon such pursuits in favor of pressing the envelope for shock value in a tradition similar to Jodorowksi. While examples of this range from the humorous (boss being anally impaled by a ladle) to the disturbing (woman giving birth to a full grown man), they unfortunately serve to fracture the film's narrative and distract viewers from gleaning anything significant from the experience.

2152144,3,B0002Z7RNG,"""Gozu,"" by Director Takashi Miike is probably not a film one wants to begin with in seeking out this talented directors film catalogue. First and foremost, it is a very difficult film to like. There are many who claim it as a masterpiece; however, I beg to disagree. And while I am used to Miike's bizarre and at times funny and wickedly delightful films, many may have trouble with this film. In ""Gozu,"" Miike takes the viewer on a surrealistic mind trip; and it's where the trip goes, and doesn't go that left this film lacking for me. However, for those who like Miike and EXTREMELY bizarre films, then I am sure you may like this film. The films narrative centers on a yakuza named Ozaki (Sho Aikawa) who is having a nervous breakdown. There is one scene in the beginning where Ozaki believes there is a 'Yakuza attack dog' ready to attack, and he commences to kill this dog: And this is about as close to normal as the film will get as it progresses further along. In fact, you will probably look back at the beginning of the film as the most NORMAL part of the film once you have managed to reach the end of the film. Yes, it gets stranger.

There are some funny scenes in the film as well as bizarre, which is a Miike trademark. However, it is the down right bizarreness of the film that you as the viewer will find shocking, strange, and totally demented. I don't know if the film is meant to have a plot. Maybe just randomly bizarre and surrealistic moments: And I am used to this in Miike's films. However, as a word of caution once again, this is not a film for everyone. When the mob boss decides that the eccentric behavior of Ozaki has gone too far, he orders that Ozaki be eliminated. This falls onto the shoulders of Ozaki's friend Minami (Hideki Sone). Things are now about to get bizarre. While Minami is driving Ozaki to a place to eliminate him, something quite unexpected happens to Ozaki, and it is while Minami is looking for a place to put his friend--that all hell breaks loose. Literally! Minami decides to stop at a diner, and when he returns, he finds that Ozaki is missing. What happened to him? Did someone take him? It's not that simple. Miike is about to take the viewer on a very strange trip.

As Minami tries to locate his former friend, he encounters all sorts of bizarre characters and events. [Bizarre is a tame word]. The film is a bit slow paced in the middle, and I found this irritating to some degree. Also, it sometimes felt as if Miike were trying to force shocking acts on the audience. But then again, he usually does. However, this gets boring sometimes. Also, while I like Japanese films immensely, I found this one to be one of those types that one does not take out too often for viewing. The ending of the film is great--one of the best, however, the film drags quite a bit. As I wrote in the beginning this is a film that can probably only be appreciated by Miike fans and those who like truly strange films. There are some sickening scenes in the film, but if you have seen Miike's films you will not be surprised. [Not to mention the very bizarre rebirth of a certain character in the film]. This is one film I won't be taking out again too soon to view. Moreover, it will not appeal to the majority of viewers out there. I recommend you rent it first. Don't expect the film to tie all loose ends, or for that matter to go anywhere [or make sense] because the films narrative is very surreal and random. As for myself, I did not find the film all that appealing. However, there are those who will. Once again, recommended with EXTREME caution.",1193011200,4,3598,4.392803598200899

This is a VERY strange flick and some have compared it to Lynch's Mulholland Drive but I've never seen that so can't say.

An underling, Minami, has been given the unenviable task of disposing his superior and best friend Ozaki, who seems to have gone crazy.  When Ozaki mysteriously dies on the road to Nagoya, and later disappears, the warped minds of writer Sakichi Sato and director Takeshi Miike rush in to assault Minami and viewers with a seemingly endless parade of quirky characters and disturbing imagery which would give Freud and Jung fits.

Why do half of the characters in a town outside Nagoya seem to make no sense?  Who exactly is the pretty young woman Minami finds in his car?  And why does he keep seeing a man with a cow head in his dreams? Minami seems to be locked into a nightmarish roller-coaster ride of insanity. I can guarantee you'll never look at milk or soup ladles the same way again.

It's just a trip in which not really much happens - the things that happen are sometimes cool, sometimes just bizarre for it's own sake, not giving you the impression that two scenes really belong to each other. The movie and its story could be told in a few minutes but is stretched with a lot of nothingness in between the scenes. The ideas could be counted on the fingers of two hands while with Lynch, it was much more uncompromising.

GOZU tells the odyssey of a man who's searching the corpse of his boss that got lost in a strange japanese town. His quest leads him from one person to the other, everyone is acting strange, one american woman for example is having a dialogue with the guy, always staring at the ceiling, but at one point she seems to have troubles telling the name of a hotel, so he checks the ceiling and finds the whole dialogue they just had written down there. Many scenes made me go ""ah wow now look there ha ha ha"", but left me untouched afterwards. I think the creators wanted to have a drifter film that you can watch and be guided throught with not really much to think. Sure, it's skillfully made and I actually liked the dialogues and events, but the way they happened was not really an experience like with ""2001 space odyssey"", ""Lost Highway"" and stuff. I would more think of ""Fear and loathing in las vegas"" for some strange reason. Some ideas I literally disliked, they made me go ""aaaw cheap cheap"", like the personality change at the end of the movie. I'd say there's no Freud and such stuff in here, it's just a fun movie in the end. Like a strange, dreamy trip.",1152230400,9,2082,4.478947368421053
2152152,4,B0002Z7RNG,Director Takashi Miike takes us on a very bizarre journey in this one.  No way to really explain something like this.  WARNING: ONLY FOR THE HARDCORE LYNCH OR MIIKE FAN.,1140566400,2,169,4.6
2152153,4,B0002Z7RNG,"Miike has lost his mind, that's for sure. What with Ichi the Killer, Izo, and Gozu, there's plenty of proof of that. But what's strange is that the loss of his sanity makes for some of the best Japanese horror films around (minus Izo). Audition, Ichi, and Gozu are his best, and Gozu is easily the strangest of the bunch. This movie, however, starts out like a normal gangster movie, introducing the key characters inside a restaurant.

But then a dog is viciously murdered and I realized just who made this movie. So, with that realization, I geared myself for the worst.

Minomi, a young Yokuza who works for a man named Brother, a psychopath in sheep's clothing, finds himself suddenly in a strange situation: he has accidentally killed his boss. Yet upon entering a small coffee shop, the body disappears from the back seat of his Ford Mustang. Despite being freaked out by the strange locals and the happenings around him, Minami decides to look for the body of Brother, and meets many more even stranger folk. He ends up at an inn run by a brother and sister, and who have their own little milk business, with a strange guest on the upper floor. Yet still, Minami's search continues in this weird world, and soon he finds what he's looking for... sort of.

This movie plays out a lot like Audition did, slowly at first, providing a few ""freak-out"" moments to keep us on our toes, until finally the most disturbing ending I've ever seen in a movie. This movies thrives off the taboo and never really tries to explain itself, and though the ""freak-outs"" are a little more subtle in Gozu than they are in Audition, they are still enough to make you keep watching. One particular moment comes about half-way, and all I'll say is that it involves milk. It's probably the goofiest scene in all of Miike's movies.

What this movie doesn't have that Audition did was that feeling of reality (though this is understandable, since Miike's mind has obviously lost the grasp on this as well). Gozu is freaky, but not enough to have nightmares over, whereas Audition was more than enough to make a think long and hard on who we date in the future. Still, this fact doesn't take much from the movie, and I'd definitely recommend Gozu to any die-hard fan of Miike or Japanese horror.",1140134400,4,2274,4.607407407407408
2152154,4,B0002Z7RNG,"Gozu (Takashi Miike, 2003)

Love him or hate him, you have to admit that Takashi Miike has a vision all his own. It's possible that Yakuza Horror Theater: Gozu (literally translated, ""gozu"" means ""bull-head"") is the ultimate expression of that vision, for here Miike is taking his V-cinema Yakuza-thriller roots and combining them with the outright weirdness that has informed his later work.

Teaming up once again with screenwriter Sakichi Sato (Ichi the Killer), Miike delivers a tale of a Yakuza underling who is tasked with taking his insane superior to a ""Yakuza dump"" in Nagoya and have him killed. The underling, Minami (Hideki Sone, who'd previously teamed with Miike in the Jingi Naki Yabo series of V-cinema flicks), still holds a great deal of respect for his superior, Ozaki (longtime Miike collaborator Sho Aikawa), who saved his life on a number of occasions, and Minami is torn as to what to do. All this is a moot point, however; while trying to save Ozaki from one of his eccentricities, Minami accidentally kills Ozaki. Minami stops at a very strange cafe to try and get his head togeher. When he looks out the window at his car, however, he sees that Ozaki's body has disappeared. The bulk of the film details Minami's search to find Ozaki and see if he truly is dead.

Miike's work is often compared to that of David Lynch, and in many cases it has often seemed to me that the reason for doing so is laziness more than anything else; ""David Lynch"" is simply the first name that springs to mind when anyone is confronted with transgressive cinema. (I'll revise that statement if and when Lynch makes anything as thoroughly off the wall as, say, Visitor Q.) In this case, however, there does seem to be a good deal of Lynching, if you will, going on; the scene where Minami has to deal with the American woman whose Japanese is scattered at best could have come right out of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. That said, while there is a David Lynch atmosphere to the movie, as usual, Miike goes so far into the transgressive world that Lynch would be hard-pressed to keep up, especially in the current American atmosphere of ""I only want to see what I've already seen."" If anything, Lynch is a sprinkling on top of a deeper compairson to the later films of Luis Bunuel here; Miike's almost complete detachment with reality, while keeping a completely realistic tone with the camerawork, especially recalls That Obscure Object of Desire, though the tone here is considerably darker.

Gozu is absolutely nuts. If you're not already familiar with Miike's style from more accessible (but still brilliant) fare like Audition, The Happiness of the Katakuris, or Sabu, you might want to give this one something of a wide berth until you've gotten yourself an education. If, however, you've found yourself thinking ""you know, Ichi the Killer just wasn't quite weird enough for me,"" then you're primed and ready to take on Gozu. ****",1131408000,6,2940,4.770137524557957

2152157,5,B0002Z7RNG,"Pity poor Tokyo Yakuza torpedo Minami, who is having a really rough week. Let's see:

1) He's a hip, stone-cold, icy loyal, leather-clad Yakuza henchman in his prime with a flawless coif who packs the muscle for his Yakuza mentor and overlord Ozaki, a guy you seriously don't want to mess with, who also happens to be a real underworld mover-and-shaker and super-duper high in the Councils of the Yakuza Big Boss;

2) But lately, Ozaki (the great Sho Aikawa) has been a little bit off his game. Strike that: he's way on edge. Scratch that analysis: he's a total fruitbat. Calm enough to drop bombs on the outside, a festering adder's nest of shrieking, diseased neurons on the inside, all screaming to get free, fly forth, unleash unholy havoc! I gotta be me!, Master Sensei---I just gotta be me!

3) Oh, and Ozaki is all paranoid, too. He's big into Paranoia. He sees conspirators and assassins everywhere: that little dog, outside the restaurant, for one. It's a Yakuza attack dog, he confides to the understandably contemptuous Big Boss. It's quick, deadly, a wicked little beast, trained to slaughter Yakuza.

4) And he doesn't take that sneaky Yakuza ninja-dog stuff lying down, either, even if everybody else thinks he's batsh*t: so he beats it out to the front of the dive, administers a little bloody tough love to the unhappy pooch, and steers it head first into the diner window.

5) Now: violence in the service of the Family is one thing. Crazy bloodlust is quite another. So the problem: Ozaki's days are numbered. And Minami, his erstwhile trusty, loyal henchman, is ordered to drive him out to---well, a little 'meeting', where saner Yakuza brothers will present Ozaki with his early retirement package.

And so Minami---with deep apprehension---chauffeurs Ozaki out in his vintage Mustang charger on the Big Bad's final mission. Well, with one little glitch: the Very Strange Little Village where Minami has to make a pit stop.

And that's where the fun really begins.

Now: has there ever been such a gloriously straightforward Takashi Miike film as ""Gozu""? Now bear with me for a second, because yeah, it's true: ""Gozu"" is filled with baffling, practically esoteric, gorgeously grotesque and fleshy and seminal diversions, in which a young Yakuza thug could find himself easily lost, warped, perverted, maybe even destroyed. Or at least made really, really late for his gig.

And make no mistake: ""Gozu"" stuffs the tatami-rooms and teahouses with Miike's parade of the bizarre, from Cow-Headed demons to lactating temple votaries, from undead transvestite waiters to well capitalized skin-suit manufacturers. It's lush. It's lavish. It's somewhat astonishing: ""Gozu"" may very well be Miike's most sensual and most philosophical film, bordering on sheer tactile perfection. It's that good.

But that said, the best way to go into a Miike film is to drink down a mug or two of piping hot sake, and plunk yourself down in front of the infernal thing. You've gotta lose yourself in it: no expectations, no spoilers. You'll get none of that here, you devil dog, you.

But what you will get is my pet theory, and see if you don't agree with me, once the credits roll and the sake's blast-furnace impact has worn off a bit: ""Gozu"" is a pretty honest, straightforward revenge flick. Ozaki tells Minami that the Boss is out chasing women, wasting time, ruining the gang. He tells him, early on, that things have gotta change, and that people might get hurt.

Did he lie?

he is in hell

throughout the movie there are images of buddhist hell and demons and, it seems to have the flow of someone who is in hell.  He does not know what is going on around him, he is struggling to figure things out, everything is off...the brother and sister lovers are images of the lovers who made the world i believe (i forget the exact mythology).  Finally, a Gozu is a cowheaded Demon that on your afterlife, judges you as a good or bad person... in the end, the person has redeemed himself through his stay in hell and is able to live a better happier life.  much like in buddhism

2152160,5,B0002Z7RNG,"Takashi Miike is a master of body horror and squirm-inducing sexual weirdness, as he's taken many opportunities to demonstrate. He's also a filmmaker capable of great wit and the cogent dissemination of actual ideas. For those who can withstand the visceral terror of the torture scenes in Audition, there is the reward of seeing an intelligent filmmaker using and subverting genre filmmaking techniques to explore an ugly facet of his culture. Gozu has its memorable moments, certainly, and is not the off-the-wall barrage of weirdness for its own sake to which Miike's work occasionally descends. It doesn't quite cohere, and its story and tone owe too much to Oliver Stone's U-Turn and David Lynch's work, but Miike has a knack for tapping into deep-seated cultural anxieties, particularly male sexual anxiety, that few filmmakers can match. Gozu starts off as a goofily offbeat yakuza story. The buildup is actually less banal and more bizarrely eventful than the romantic drama trappings that set up Audition, and while the payoff is doesn't have the same brutal logic as in the earlier film, it is equal in the visceral way it sears itself into one's brain. There are odd bits and borrowings in Gozu, like the cue-card-reading woman and the yakuza boss' sexual obsession, and the bizarre relationship .totally fantastic great movie.",1119052800,2,1338,5.1422018348623855
2152161,3,B0002Z7RNG,"I have went on a Miike film watching rampage watching (Ichi, Visitor Q, Katakuris, Dead or Alive 1-3, Fudoh, Gozu, Full Metal Yakuza.  What I am finding my main criticism of Miike to be is that he often has one or two stand out scenes inserted into an otherwise very poor or boring story.  Only Visitor Q and Ichi the Killer were paced well and had interesting content through the entire running times.

Miike usually provides something very good in every movie but I end up resenting the wasted time watching the rest of the movie.

This is one of those.  It starts funny enough with a Yakuza who has gone crazy.  He shows this by being paranoid of a ""Yakuza Attack Dog"" outside who is similar to the dog you see in the Legally Blonde poster.  He decides to kill it before it kills the boss and then kills some poor innocent family's pet.

Well, since he has become an obvious liability to the Yakuza organization, the boss assigns his brother to take him to a place (I forget the name) where he can be disposed of.

He and his brother travel by car but along the way, he mysteriously disappears and strange situations are constantly confronting his brother as he tries to find him again.

The problem is that it all unfolds too slowly and his situations really weren't all that interesting.  It didn't help that most of the things are similar to scenes in other Miike films.

However, the last scene is a solid 5 star perfect treasure that will cause you to grieve it being wasted on an otherwise sub-par film.  I will resist temptation to give it away but if you do watch this film and start thinking it is not worth finishing, please trust me that you will want to finish the movie.

I will say it is very similar to the scene in Visitor Q where the man is stuck inside the women, but it has a much different reason and conclusion.

My conclusion on many of these Miike films is that the standout scenes don't justify them being keepers with their otherwise long uninteresting stories.

Without describing it, the end scene is perfectly acted, directed, and has satisfying special effects.  It exceeds normal Miike standout moments and is perfection of what I'd like to get out of a movie experience.

The question is, is the last scene good enough of a payoff to justify spending the other 2 hours of boredom?  Yes, actually it is.",1118016000,2,2336,4.479905437352246
2152162,5,B0002Z7RNG,"This Miike film loses all character depth without the viewer having some prior knowledge of buddhism.

That being said...just know beforehand that first of all, this is a yakuza-based film shot in Nagoya, which is definitely not a usual background for yakuza based films. The brother-sister inn-keeper team, incestuous at that, are based on buddhist gods, as is the title of the film, gozu, or cow head. The reincarnation of Ozaki as a woman is also taken from buddhist mythology...a theme which throughout the movie pieces together the very strong homosexual undercurrent.

Now, for the general person watching this film just because it is a Miike film....there is enough gore and oddness to keep your attention without the buddhist ties. For instance, the beginning when Ozaki kills the chihuahua, it really throws the viewer for a loop, and it sets the entire movie up for the insanity that is Miike...the flipside of the dog scene is that a series of commercials ran in Japan which set that particular type of dog up as a status symbol, so there was some political humor to that scene.

For me personally....i really liked the very last frame of the entire movie, which for me summed up everything i had thought all along...there is a scene at the end that is definitely unforgettable, but the scene i am referring to is the still frame right before the credits roll.

A mob boss browbeats an underling over the phone while having sex with a ladle planted firmly up his rectum.  An innkeeper lactates into bottles in order to avoid paying for milk, and later flogs her simple-minded brother with a chimney brush while he attempts to conjure up a spirit for a stunned guest.  A drooling, cow-headed demon suddenly shows up in a dream sequence, then vanishes as quickly as it had appeared with no explanation whatsoever.

Sound weird?  Well, it should.  However, the foregoing are just a sampling of the oddities on display in Gozu (Japanese for ""Cow head,"" apparently), a film that's sure to have even the most experienced enthusiasts of far-out cinema shaking their heads in wonderment.  Directed by notorious Japanese weird-out master Takashi Miike with his typical combination of high style, black humor, and random acts of weirdness, Gozu is a relentlessly inscrutable movie, constantly throwing a new curveball at you just when you think you've got a grip on it.  And while Miike has certainly toned down the bloodshed for which he's renowned here, his knack for unforgettable set pieces has obviously managed to survive intact.  This movie has some images that WILL remain seared onto your retinas for some time after viewing, none more so than its literally unbelievable conclusion.  There's not even a suitable description for that scene; you've just got to see it.

At the movie's beginning, things look much more innocent, or at least simpler.  After the aforementioned mentally unbalanced Yakuza, Ozaki (played with menacing flair by Japanese crime-movie mainstay Sho Aikawa), commits his shocking act of doggy-cide in the opening scene, his boss decides he must be taken out.  The task of doing the deed falls to his underling and closest friend, Minami (Hideki Sone), a nice enough sort who's understandably conflicted about whacking his old buddy.  However, Minami manages to get the job done, albeit in a somewhat unconventional manner, and proceeds to a predetermined dump site in order to dispose of the body.  Unfortunately, Minami makes a quick stop for coffee in a diner populated by some, er, offbeat characters, and suddenly looks at his car and finds Ozaki inexplicably gone.  And that's when things get *really* weird.

His search for Ozaki takes Minami to a town filled with bizarre characters, from a gangster with no pigment on one side of his face to the aforementioned lactating innkeeper to a couple of weirdos who sit around a diner talking about the weather; and things just keep getting stranger from there.  It quickly becomes apparent that Minami is the most normal person in the movie, and much of the fun of watching Gozu comes from observing the cognitive dissonance as Minami tries to adjust to the reality of his surroundings.  It's horror of a sort, but it springs more from a deep-seated discomfort than from any particular shock or fright, and Sone conveys it brilliantly with little more than the frequent look of befuddlement on his face.  The pacing is admittedly slow, sometimes painfully so, but that doesn't stop Gozu from being a triumph of atmosphere and surrealism. Minami is the proverbial stranger in a strange land, but here the land is strange in more ways than one.  It's been said that the often tenuous nature of reality is a common theme in Miike's work, and that's apparent here, as Gozu gets a lot of mileage out of seeing Minami placed in such uncomfortable surroundings and witnessing one scarcely conceivable event after another.

Sometimes (the Yakuza boss with a ladle up his butt being a prime example) the movie's bizarre imagery is gratuitous (if funny), but in other places it's clearly designed to shock you into thinking.  This becomes especially apparent in the film's final half, when the unlikely reappearance of Ozaki in an, er, modified form begin's Miike's exploration of the reincarnation/rebirth angle that gives Gozu what emotional resonance it has.  This theme gains its fullest expression in the literally jaw-dropping finale, which surely ranks as one of the most stunning in film history.  Again, nothing that can be written in this space can do this scene justice.  It has to be seen to be disbelieved.

With all the bizarre happenings going on, Gozu is definitely a challenging watch and not exactly for everyone, but fortunately the plethora of extras on the DVD do a whole lot to enhance the viewing experience.  Especially useful is the fanboy commentary track from film critics Andy Klein and Wade Major, who discuss some of the underlying themes of the movie like two experts dissecting a football game, while simultaneously placing it in context among both Miike's repertoire in particular and Japanese cinema in general.  You also get an essay from Miike expert Tom Mes that cites some of the film's ideas and influences and no less than three interviews with Miike that see him talking about his philosophy on filmmaking and analyzing some of his own work.  Miike is certainly one strange cat, which probably explains why he made this movie in the first place, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Instead, Minami finds the road to their destination washed out and must take a detour into a small town straight from The Twilight Zone.

If you watch a lot of the more left field japanese movies, you'll be able to appreciate this film, just don't expect anything serious out of the cow-headed demon. all he does is slobber all over the main character's face... then it switches over to some bizarre sibling lust shot that I'm still trying to make sense of. additionally, if you have any knowledge of modern japanese culture, you'll be able to see the humor and bizarrity in the situations this movie creates for the main character... if you have no prior knowledge of japanese culture whatsoever, you might just spend the whole 2+ hours scratching your head and muttering profanity under your breath as you give yourself a migraine trying to sort everything out - unless you're one of the people who sites ""Pink Flamingos"" as your favorite movie, in which case you'll just get a kick out of everybody acting like a lunatic and doing inexplicable, and disgusting things. Any movie that can make ""Love and a .45"" and ""Doom generation"" look like ""My Dog Skip"" is OK in my book. this isn't the kind of film you rave about and tell your friends they should watch unless you have the kind of friendship where recommending movies that make angels cry isn't a relationship-killer.... On a personal note, after the end of the film I just coulden't look at the gravy ladle in my kitchen for a while without getting a little sick and thinking about corn (well... I THINK it was corn. I'm still not sure). watch this film on a partially empty stomach.",1108944000,3,2827,4.648
2152170,3,B0002Z7RNG,"Self-styled bad boy auteur Takashi Miike has made some pretty bizarre additions to his canon during the past few years. Anyone who thought they had him pegged as an indie schlock-pimp would've been thrown by the likes of Zebraman (offbeat family comedy) and Chakushin Ari, aka One Missed Call (a Ring-esque horror that was about as conventional as they come). However, even by these standards, Gozu is a bit of an odd tangent - could this be the first truly BORING Miike film?

Short answer: yes. Though it's bookended by some spectacularly gross sequences (if you thought Audition's use of cheese wire was excrutiating enough, you should see what Miike can do with a ladle), the majority of Gozu is devoted to a painfully drawn-out shaggy dog story of sorts. The plot - for what it's worth - centers around hapless yakuza Minami, who is charged with taking his ""brother"", Ozaki, to Nagoya to have him bumped-off. When the latter mysteriously disappears, Minami trawls through a beaten-up rural wasteland to find him, alternately helped and hindered by a slew of weirdo yokels (among them, an ever-lactating inn hostess, a self-styled albino and a failed psychic). There are shades of David Lynch and oddball British TV series The League of Gentlemen at play here, but Gozu lacks the focus of either - its occasional jokes hang in the air for minutes on end, never quite finding a punchline. Over the course of its tortuous two-hours-plus running time, Miike barely musters half an hour of decent material - though, to be fair, when he finally lets rip with his gross-out finale, you'll almost be willing to forgive him for the torpor that preceded it. Almost.",1107820800,5,1660,4.865724381625442
2152171,5,B0002Z7RNG,"i absolutely loved this film.  without destroying the story let me tell you if one were to classify this film it would be a cross between a gangster, horror thriller, suspense mystery, and a weird twisted version of love.  The japaneese are twisted and boy is this movie its gots some weird but intellectual humor constantly throughout the film.  Its a little slow but it adds to the strangness of the world the main character is in.  Every scene is so perfectly scripted in such an odd but intriguing way.  The main character searches for his brother which may sound kinda boring but its bizarre, everyone he meets and everywhere he goes is off, theres something just not right about it all.  Its like he's stuck in a dream and he is the only one and all he wants to do is find his lost brother!  Throw in the dreamlike paranoia with the artistic creative side of this directors works and you got GOZU! gozu meaning cow head's got some real memorable scenes that yourll be feeling sick to or laughing about or just plain remembering at random points in the day for a long time.",1107475200,11,1078,4.469387755102041
2152172,3,B0002Z7RNG,"Not having seen anything but ""Gozu"" in what I've read is an illustrious catalogue by filmmaker Takasha Miike, I can't judge him solely on the strengths and weaknesses of this film in particular.  It was a wild, riveting ride, with some unforgettable scenes (particularly the opening, in which a slowly deteriorating member of the Yakuza crime family murders a puppy in the belief that it is a ""Yakuza attack dog"", and of course the queasy ""rebirth"" scene of that very same gangster at the film's conclusion), and at times reminds one of a Beckett play (the man with the pigment problem reclining in the field with a magazine, the innkeeper whipping her husband to generate ""spirits"", etc) a Lynch film (characters changing identities, gender bending, scenes of the most cartoonish sexual debauchery), and Monty Python all at once.  The problem, though, is that none of this means anything.  Unlike Lynch or Beckett we can find no discernible meaning, not even with the most circumspect viewing, simply because there is none.

While I love surrealism, a movie does need to be more than the sum of it's parts, and ""Gozu"", for all it's nail biting scenes and undeniably menacing atmosphere, is only that.  A member of the Yakuza family named Ozaki is killed as he is about to commit a random of madness by Minami, a friend indebted to him forever for saving his life.

From here everything goes wacky, and not in an unpleasant manner entirely: his corpse disappears from Minami's car.  There are strong elements of Hitchcock here, too, but from this point in the film nothing really makes any sense, even in retrospect.  We see a host of bizarre and stomach churning things: an inkeeper who likes to squirt her own milk rather than buy it from the store, handicapped Japanese people screaming about whether the day was hot or not.  Meanwhile our protagonist is taken on a journey that is imaginative and surreal but, in the end, all smoke.

In the film essay Miike cites the influence, which is obvious anyway, of David Lynch films like ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive"".  There are definitely similarities.  In those movies, though, as strange and dreamlike as they are, there is an ultimate explanation, or host of explanations, for why things have happened this way.  Not all Lynch films have an ""ultimate point"", but those two did, and ""Gozu"" most certainly does not.  This is more than enjoyable, don't get me wrong; in fact, for people of certain tastes, including my own, I'd recommend it.  But don't expect a puzzle or anything to think extensively about.",1107043200,21,2564,4.848623853211009
2152173,4,B0002Z7RNG,"Like most of Takashi Miike's films, 'Gozu' is tough to watch.  There are scenes here that are just hard to look at without scrunching your face up in shock/disguist(i.e. the dog at the beginning of the film, the lactation scene, the adult birth at the end, etc.).  The film is slowly paced with sparse dialogue, filled with strange imagery, random scenes and oddly disturbing characters(i.e. ladle man, and the possibly retarded guy who keeps talking about the weather).  In a nutshell, and for lack of better words, this film is truly repugnant.

I'm not really sure how to explain the film.  I think it is better to go in knowing nothing and be amazed and/or disturbed by the many goings ons.  This is not for the weak stomached.  This is not for action movie lovers.  I really don't know who this movie is for.

Miike is an amazing director.  His films need to be seen because he is doing things today that no filmmaker anywhere in the world would even think of doing and he's doing them in a way that no one could or would even dare to.  He's pushing the envelope in a time when very few filmmakers are.  And 'Gozu' is probably the furthest he's ever pushed it.",1105747200,8,1165,4.469194312796208
8035145,5,B0002Z7RNG,"Takashi Miike is a very strange man - I think there's sufficient evidence of that fact that I need not justify it further. So if I tell you that GOZU is probably Miike's weirdest film to date, you will know that we are talking some world-class oddity. Billed as a ""Yakuza Horror"" film, which is a label that just about fits if you consider that Japanese horror films have always shown a very different sensibility than Hollywood films (Japanese horror is generally of a quite intangible nature, about the horror of the unknown and the incomprehensible - not so much about the big scary monsters). GOZU is interesting in that the ""horror"" of it comes almost entirely from the way it is filmed - the camera work, the editing and the sound effects all come together to create a sense of foreboding and fear that for the most part is not at all born out by the actual events in the film. Miike is probably making the point that most horror films are just exercises in film-making technique these days, rather than presenting truly frightening content. Or perhaps he just fancied a way to make his latest Yakuza film a little bit different :)

Miike is definitely one of the most creative film-makers working in the world today - quite possibly *the* most, given his insanely prolific output and the fact that almost every film he makes manages to be unique and memorable. Doing that with one film a year would be an impressive feat, and Miike gives us at least 3-4 such films every year. GOZU shows him on fine creative form once more, turning a story that probably isn't all that interesting into a surreal, dreamlike experience. The plot itself is very minimal, and largely irrelevant for most of the 125 minute running time. Basically, a Yakuza is told to take his yakuza-brother (Sho Aikawa) to an out of the way part of Japan and get rid of him, as he been showing signs of going a bit loopy. However, before he can carry out his orders, Aikawa disappears - and most of the rest of the film is concerned with Minami's efforts to find him. But that description really sells short the content of the film, which is really about the strange characters he encounters and the even stranger experiences that he has.

Going into more detail about what happens wouldn't add a lot to this review, so I won't. Just be prepared to ""go with the flow"" and see what the film has to offer, rather than expecting anything specific from it. Don't expect a nice neat resolution at the end, either, 'cause you'll definitely be disappointed. Miike's films are often films that need to be seen in just the right mood to be enjoyed, and I'm glad I made the decision that my mood wasn't right when I started watching GOZU 6 months ago. The film sat there waiting for me until this weekend, when I figured the time was as good as it was going to get, and it paid off in spades :)

Miike's films often suffer on repeat viewings, and I am pretty sure this will be true of GOZU - at over 2 hours it is definitely too long, and there are sure to be scenes that are a bit of a chore to sit through when you know what's coming. I couldn't say which scenes they are from a first viewing though, so there's nothing that's truly redundant in there, and I hope that the US distributors that recently acquired the film will remember that their viewers would rather make the decision themselves about any scenes that weren't needed. i.e. uncut, please!",1523923200,,3417,4.490353697749196

8035150,5,B0002Z7RNG,"It's my favorite film ever made.

Miike is a visionary genius and poet-as-filmmaker eschewing big budgets and fame in this case for pure artistic expression. The film is by turns horrifying, hilarious, mysterious, slow, fast, with a deep emphasis on lactation & the isolation of mental illness. Like almost all his films it focuses on how the Yakuza is a lifestyle that allows outcasts from normal Japanese society to exist and thrive as long as they follow the rules and strict hierarchy. This film is not for people who can't see violence in films. It has one of my favorite endings ever. The poeticism has many parallels with The Double Life of Veronique, although that film doesn't deal with taboo subjects it definitely has a similar style that doesn't focus on overt narrative structure. The word surreal is used and abused in film reviews but this film is truly surreal. If you don't like viewing violence, lactation, licking, guns, sex, brotherly love beyond gender norms, etc, then you won't be able to access the poeticism of this film and will merely remain shocked and in awe.",1500681600,,1088,4.849462365591398
8035151,1,B0002Z7RNG,"I...uh...well...that was a...movie...

What the actual **** did I just watch? Here I'm looking at the premise thinking ""Yakuza + Horror? Sure that sounds like a good time!"" And then I watch...whatever this was...

I couldn't stop laughing at the ridiculousness of the whole thing. There's no context for anything that happens, it just does. If you want to go on a trip to some weird fetish-y weirdfest where some old lady at an inn tries to make people drink her breast-milk then maybe you're in the right place, but probably not.

This movie just gets weird for the sake of being weird.

There is seriously a part where some girl just randomly shows up claiming to be a different male character. The main character just decides to take her to the boss for some reason, and the boss decides he wants to have sex with her so he takes her to his place where he picks one of half a dozen metal ladles out of a volcano display or something like that in the room, sticks one end in his rear entrance in front of this girl, and then they're interrupted by the main character rapelling down to the balcony using a hose and failing hard enough at it that the boss has to walk out there and help him down (ladle still firmly clenched between his cheeks). Then they fight, the boss is knocked down, the main character breaks a lamp and uses it to electrocute the boss to death by touching the lamp to the ladle that's still in his bum. BUT WAIT THAT'S NOT ALL. The main character then just runs off with this woman, and now they are alone and getting ready to ""get it on.""

No joke, this is how it plays out: They struggle for a minute when the guy ""goes in"" and for some reason he starts freaking out. Attached by their groins he pulls her around the room, out the room and back in trying to get free. When he finally does, a freaking hand comes out of the girl's groin. Then, a FULL GROWN MAN who turns out to be the character she said she was earlier just climbs right the **** out of her insides like it was nothing. The woman goes and takes a bath as if nothing happened, and the three of them go outside as if everything's completly normal and then cut. Roll credits.

You mean to tell me after all that setup you're just gonna have a full-grown man who's been missing the whole movie crawl out of a woman's vagina and then you're not going to even TRY to explain that ****?",1491696000,,2370,4.279017857142857

8035154,2,B0002Z7RNG,"I SO wanted to like this movie. ""Audition"", also directed by Takashi Miike, is one of my all-time favorites.  Plus, the movie starts out as a very engaging dark comedy with a talented lead actor playing a likable protagonist...So what could go wrong??  Well, 1st one gross scene - I was like, ""OK, that was unnecessary, but whatever"". Then really gross, nauseating scene after scene...Just when you think you can't get any more grossed out..,WHOA!  you can!  So I sat through this entire movie and I have a theory.  I think Takashi Miike did this on a bet - maybe for his own amusement but it seems more like something a guy would do on a bet - that he could make a movie in which includes at least one appearance of every possible fluid or excretion of the human body.  They are all there, featured intrusively:

saliva - check
urine - check
feces - check
vomit - check.
breast milk - check
semen - check
anything which can be expelled from the female genitals including amniotic fluid - check.
blood - check
lymph and other body fluids - well, they show a barrel full of all the contents of a liquified human, so check.
tears?  Nor so sure anybody cried.  watch and see - I am not planning to re-watch.

I hope this disgusting list does not lead to my review being censored, because I think viewers should be fairly warned before they watch the film uncensored, which is far more graphic than my list.
If you enjoy this kind of stuff, then go for it.  Thje acting is good and the plot - a short story turned into a feature length film through frequent forays into the repulsive - was quite engaging.",1486684800,,1601,4.41156462585034
