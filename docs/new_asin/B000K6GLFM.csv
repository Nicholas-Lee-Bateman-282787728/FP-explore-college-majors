8154482,3,B000K6GLFM,"I'm not sure why Amazon deleted the review I posted last month. I suppose it was too long. In it I listed all 100 movies, the stars, years of theatrical release and quality of video transfer. Sigh, well, blame Amazon for removing this information. The main listing as well as the box tell us nothing.

So here's the nutshell review: Content-wise, I won't comment because everyone has different tastes in movies. Quality-wise, I have to say that some of these movies are almost unwatchable while others are surprisingly clean. Unfortunately most fall closer to the unwatchable side.

There is also evidence that these versions have been edited. Or rather I should say that I have found other copies which feature smoother editing. In particular, this version of ""The Front Page"" chops out the entire foreword & some of the opening music (its quality is also atrocious compared to the remastered version I found elsewhere).

This collection is not for collectors. In other words, if you love Fred Astaire and want to own all his films, don't bother with this. Wait a few years for the remastered/restored versions. If, on the other hand, you just love old movies to watch on a rainy day or a late night, this will be perfect.

As a final note: many of these films are in public domain, which means you can download them free and legal from various PD sites. I'd tell you where, but Amazon would probably use it as an excuse to delete my review.",1174521600,57,1442,4.687747035573122
