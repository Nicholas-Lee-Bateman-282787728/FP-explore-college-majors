360065,5,630179821X,"One of Jamie Lee Curtis' early roles as a Hollywood ""Scream Queen"". She did this after the much successful ""Halloween"" in 1978. This DVD edition done by 20th Century Fox, is decent in picture quality and sound. In fact, it is even better than that ""copy"" Scream Factory put out a few years ago. That one had dirt in it throughout the movie. So, I kept this DVD and added it to the Blu-ray for the nice Special Features it contained. This edition only has the Theatrical Trailer, if that in some cases. Menu design is simple.
I won't go into the movie ""plot"", but it is basically a ""revenge style"" killing slasher movie on a train when Seniors from College get together for one last ""Hoorah"" on New Year's Eve. Jamie Lee being one of the Seniors, of course. lol

360068,4,630179821X,"As with most slasher flicks, the formula is closely adhered to: trap some kids on a moving train then start picking them off one by one.  The body count was not impressive but there was some method to the madness of the killer (dispose of everyone who humiliated him three years prior).  As far as practical jokes go, convincing someone that they are about to bed a girl of marginal beauty, only to find themselves with a medical corpse instead, goes well beyond rudimentary spite.  Im almost certain carting around cadavers is some type of crime, if not a health code violation!  At any rate, it unduly disturbed the victim to the point that death seemed equitable.  For good measure, he also took down some innocent bystanders who got in his way.  Jamie Lee Curtis plays Alana, the bait who lured poor Kenny (Derek MacKinnon) to his humiliation.  Without her complicity, the joke wouldnt have worked, which makes her as monstrous as the dope (Hart Bochner as Doc) who cooked up the gag.

Not as good as some slasher flicks but better than most, Terror Train has its moments, making this a good addition to any collection.  If I had to pick one sour note, it would be David Copperfield playing a magician, doing stupefying banal tricks.........three times too many.",1451433600,,1266,4.718181818181818

360385,4,630179821X,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this '80s slasher movie...

Terror Train (1980) stars Jamie Lee Curtis.  This movie is a slasher movie that takes place on a moving train, so there is a claustrophobic feel to it.  Passengers are dressed in costumes for a New Year's Eve costume party, then all hell breaks loose when a killer is stalking around.  That's all I want to say.  Watch to see how everything unfolds.  This movie also stars a young David Copperfield, who performs magic tricks to entertain the passengers on the train.  This movie is very predictable, but is also suspenseful.  There are many scenes that remind me of scenes from previous slasher movies, such as Halloween (1978), particularly when Jamie Lee Curtis is being followed around by the madman.  The movie has pretty good atmosphere, especially the outdoor scenes showing the train riding down the tracks many times throughout the movie.  Overall, a pretty good slasher from the early 1980s that I recommend seeing at least once.

I give this movie 3 1/2 stars, rounded up to 4.",1395446400,,1107,4.798941798941799

360388,4,630179821X,"Terror Train, from 1980, was one film in a long line of horror vehicles for Jamie Lee Curtis. While I consider it better than The Fog (also 1980), it doesn't hold up as well as Prom Night (also 1980). In fact her best are the first two Halloween outings.

The film itself is pretty standard slasher fare from the slasher boom of the late 1970's and early 1980's. The plot has a masked killer targeting six college kids (med students) responsible for a prank gone wrong three years earlier. Now they are throwing a large New Year's Eve costume party on a train. The prank was done to a kid called Kenny Hampson, who winds up psychologically disturbed and stows away on the train, after killing a college kid dressed as Groucho Marx and adorning the costume. Systematically people start dying until the conductor notices and all hell seems to break loose. There is also a magician on the train (played by young David Copperfield), probably to add to the entertainment value of the piece.

Note: There is no final girl in this one as many students survive.

Great movie for those already initiated into the horror genre. If you're new to horror, watch the staples such as Halloween, The Burning, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Friday the 13th first.",1392076800,,1246,4.654545454545454

The story is a classic revenge tale, that takes place a year after college graduation. It's New Years Eve and Sorority/Frat group rents a train for their party. All is fine until someone is found dead on the train. Little do they know that their past joke on a pledge is coming back to haunt them; to get revenge for the humiliation done to him.

360497,4,630179821X,"It's New Year's Eve and a group of college buddies are taking to the train-tracks for a wild night out. Unfortunately, someone has crashed the party, someone who knows a secret and who bears a striking resemblance to Groucho Marx. Oh the horror!

""Terror Train"" is a snap-shot of the fleeting era of early `80s slashers following in the wake of 1978's ""Halloween,"" before the genre smothered itself in excess and collapsed under its own weight. There's no gratuitous nudity to be found (save for an unfortunate cadaver), there's not much humor or style to the killings, and director Roger Spotiswoode attempts to pack the film with mounting suspense as opposed to merely counting down to its finale with a series of deaths. The results are a film that is relatively classy when compared to others at its time, but at the same time, feels slightly formulaic.

The film is at least worth watching for Jamie Lee Curtis, who gives a sympathetic and layered performance, driven home by that signature scream of hers. The film is also note-worthy for inexplicably featuring magician David Copperfield and for a pre-""Die Hard"" Hart Bochner as a ""Manley"" med-student. Though not a landmark effort in its genre, ""Terror Train"" mostly delivers the goods and is an engaging little film that surprisingly holds up rather well today.

The premise is simple. It's graduation time for many college students and to celebrate a train is rented for a long party. Without giving more away, the students find themselves aboard with a psychotic killer who starts killing people quietly, no one knows until several kids are dead.

360579,1,630179821X,"My railroad club shows train movies (at members' homes-copyright laws, y'know) every month. There are some excellent Hollywood railroad movies-""The General,"" ""The Train,"" ""von Ryan's Express,"" etc. For Halloween, I saw ""Terror Train"" listed on IMDB. With Jamie Lee Curtis, yet. How bad could it be? And with my favorite magician, David Copperfield. So I sent away for it. Fortunately for my self respect in the club, I previewed it before showing.

Great sufferin' horny toads.

Now, I'm not saying this is the WORST movie ever made. There are far nobler candidates, like ""Plan 9"" for that august title. But it is unique in that it is the only BORING slasher movie I've ever seen. I made it through the first half hour, and came to the conclusion that if David Copperfield actually saw this woofer before it was released, he would have tried to disappear himself.

I had tried to prep the club by saying it had an excellent director, and a world-class cinematographer PLUS an actual rented steam locomotive and train. All true. But when you saw the action scenes set in the train, the car appeared to be about 20 feet wide. After seeing it, I realized that there was no way I was going to be able to show it and save face. It wasn't even bad in a campy/funny way. It was Just. Plain. Dreadful.

So, I would only recommend this if it was your life goal to see every train movie ever made. A little tip, however. Put it at the end of the list.",1321660800,,1441,4.509578544061303

360586,4,630179821X,"Formulaic story about revenge and mass murder. The story is quite simple, several college students, who years earlier, played a cruel prank on the resident nerd, are being killed one by one by a masked killer inside a chartered train during their New Years Eve's Masquerade party. Although the story itself follows the typical slasher movie formula and the killers identity is pretty much known within the first few minutes, this chilling little nail-biter offers little to no gore but like Carpenter's epic ""Halloween"" it substitutes it with loads of suspense, great atmosphere and some clever twists to keep the audience guessing. You have a hard time trying to figure out where the killer is as he keeps changing from one creepy looking costume to another. The cast is also great, Ben Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Hart Bochner, David Copperfield, Vanity (as DD Winters) and several other unknown actors turn in some decent to good performances. Curtis is especially pleasing in a role she was all too familiar with but few would argue her status as one of horror's greatest ""Scream Queens"".

The pacing however, is where this film falls short. There is a lot of talk mixed in with a David Copperfield (sporting a wickedly bad period hairdo) magic show and more talk and talk and talk. Those who are yearning for a blood-soaked gore extravaganza will be the most disappointed with this since other genre films that had terrible pacing would make up for it with a tremendous amount of slaughter and gore (""The Prowler"", ""The Burning"", any ""Friday the 13th"" film), ""Terror Train"" is incredibly tame by comparison. With that said, a lot of young imbeciles do get slaughtered here and although it may not be as visually visceral as the films stated above, there is a tremendous amount of suspense, something a lot of these films lack. The killer goes incognito wearing several bone-chilling costumes and like ""Halloween"", this film saves the best scenes for last. When Jamie Lee Curtis and the masked maniac come face to face, a nicely staged cat and mouse chase begins. Those scenes are the film's major highlights and Curtis gives it her all. I do wish they would have gotten a little more creative with the death scenes since this film was very creative in some of its ideas and it would have benefitted greatly in having a Carpenter-esque score.

I've always had a soft spot for this film. It is not in the same category as the other splatter films and that is a good thing as this one is slightly better than most. The suspense is here, as is the creepiness factor and although the pacing is weak at times and the film too dark to see all of the action clearly, the climax is satisfying. Lets not forget that any horror film that has ""Scream Queen"" Jamie Lee Curtis is never half bad. It is nowhere near as good as ""Halloween"" or ""Black Christmas"" (it is definitely better than ""Prom Night"") but if you have the patience to sit through a slasher film with a lot less gore, a lot more talk, action, suspense, good performances and Jamie Lee Curtis, then ""Terror Train"" is worth the ride. 3.5 out of 5.",1258675200,,3101,4.698529411764706

360638,1,630179821X,"I have no idea why I rented Terror Train.  I suspect it was because it's considered a horror classic.  And in that regard viewing the film has been quite educational.

Having already established Jamie Lee Curtis' reputation as a Scream Queen in Halloween, Curtis took the cinema by storm in no less than three horror movies in 1980: The Fog, Prom Night, and Terror Train.

Terror Train's premise is interesting: college frat boys and sorority girls foist a cruel prank on a freshman (Kenny), snapping his fragile mind.  Kenny, you see, actually killed someone else once before attending college, although ""they couldn't prove he did it."" How do you know someone killed someone if you can't prove he did it?  Shh!  Suffice it to say that Kenny is an unbalanced killer who has it out for the students who pulled that cruel prank. Fortunately, the students help Kenny in his revenge by all throwing a costume party on an old train three years after the incident.

So there we have it.  We know who the killer is and where the killing is going to take place. Like all good horror films, Terror Train already has its villains' motivation and the audience's sympathy.  There's no need to show each student being a jerk; they are all guilty simply by participating in the original prank.  The train hasn't been modernized, so it has no radio, isolating the victims. And of course, the costume party allows Kenny to walk amongst his prey with ease.

Thing is, Terror Train isn't interested in playing by the rules it creates. There's a possible foil in the guise of Ken, the stage magician (David Copperfield failing to act...God help us all). Surely the master of stage acts is the killer, right?  Right?!

Poor Kenny.  He has so many challenges to overcome: physical barriers, train doors, blood stains, dead bodies, logic, and the laws of physics, to name a few. Fortunately, Kenny has some help from the director, who allows him to teleport from car to car, quick-change into any costume at will, silently murder people with his bare hands, and clean up a bloody bathroom in record time. Move over Dexter, Kenny can change into his crime fighting costume AND clean up his mess - give that man his own show!

But alas, it is not to be.  Kenny has to contend with dark scenes of people running on a train, boring scenes of Copperfield's magic tricks, more boring scenes of students getting drunk or high, a random piercing whistle of a train, and a nosy conductor who likes to perform magic tricks of his own.

The surprise twist at the end is notable only in that Terror Train probably did it first. But by that point you won't care.  And oh yeah...

SPOILER ALERT

Kenny dies at the end.

You cant imagine anyone amongst this crowd being the killer. Theres only one person in this movie you would think could possibly be the killer and You're right. It is that obvious and simple.

What isn't wrong with this movie? The acting was terrible, the characters uninteresting, there were 30 minutes of magic tricks and the killer wasn't scary. This might as well have been a David Copperfield magic show instead of a horror movie.

This definitely falls into the 3 worst horror movies ive ever seen. I couldn't find one redeemable quality in this film. This wasn't a 'so bad its good movie', this was a BAD movie.

It came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it. Whether the movies promised to be good or bad, we went and had fun with them either way. This one we had fun in how bad it was. This was one of those, ""picked on, pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank, only to come back with genius killer skills, somehow attained super strength and the speed of the Road Runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play."" In short, there's nothing to be believed in this stinker. LIke a ""Friday the 13th"" flick, you merely wait for the kills, and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends, and pray for that to come as soon as possible. The movie pulls out the stops, giving us Curtis for eye candy and David Copperfield to amaze us, perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect. But in general, this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a ""Halloween"" type thriller. There's too much stupidity from the victims, oh, until one genius finally puts 2 and 2 together. There's too much ""not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison."" And given her presence, there's just not enough Jamie Lee to make this crock worth sitting through. We had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre. It made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse, more predictable, and far too numerous to maintain our interest. This movie got that ball rolling. Don't waste your time. You'll get more excitement out of watching Jamie Lee's finger nails dry for a couple hours.",1154044800,,1784,4.3283582089552235
360725,4,630179821X,"I rented Terror Train (1980) with a friend of mine about ten years ago and I remember after we watched it we were both like ""Is that it?""  Not recalling what our criticisms of the film were at the time, but I decided to give it another chance, and you know what?  I liked it...I really did...I'll grant you it's not an outstanding feature, but the effort is there, resulting in an overall solid film.  Directed by Roger Spottiswoode (The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper, Turner & Hooch, Tomorrow Never Dies), the movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis (The Fog, Trading Places, A Fish Called Wanda), who, a couple years earlier, had appeared in a little horror feature you may have heard of called Halloween (1978).  Also appearing is Ben Johnson (Hang 'Em High, Red Dawn), Hart Bochner (Breaking Away, Supergirl, Die Hard), Derek McKinnon (Breaking All the Rules), Sandee Currie (Terminal Choice), Timothy Webber (The Hotel New Hampshire), and David Copperfield, who was at one time engaged to supermodel Claudia Schiffer but called it off as their relationship interfered with his work, earning himself a place in the `What the f?' hall of fame.

As the movie opens, it's New Year's Eve, and the boys at the Sigma Phi Omega house are having a party.  After a prank directed at one of the spaz fraternity pledges goes horribly wrong, we fast forward three years and see another New Year's Eve bash in the offing, this time a costume affair taking place on an excursion train, hosted by Doc (Bochner) and Mo (Webber), two of the fraternity brothers responsible for the prank that occurred three years ago.  Also in attendance is Alana (Curtis), Mo's girlfriend, who was also involved in the prank, but not to the extent to being fully aware of what exactly Doc and Mo had planned, resulting in some bad blood between her and Doc, who was essentially the ringleader (and a real a-hole, to boot).  Anyway, turns out the nerdlinger who was the victim of the gag is now a dangerous, homicidal psychopath, has decided this a good opportunity to exact his revenge by sneaking on board the train and murdering all those who wrong him back in the day.  Actually, it was a pretty good move because not only is most everyone disguised in costumes, but they're also stoned and/or drunk, and easy pickings.  Also, the trip is an all night deal with no place to stop, so once the fun begins, it won't end until it ends...eventually those on board learn there's a killer among them (after the corpses start piling up), but he could be disguised as anyone, so who's to be trusted?  Oh yeah, a magician played by David Copperfield is also on board for the purpose of entertaining the rubes, performing his illusions (never call them tricks as that really ticks him off).

Like I said, I liked this Canadian produced movie, at least the 2nd time around.  I'm not sure what changed, other than the fact I'm older, but I think I have a bit more appreciation for the effort put into developing the characters within the film.  I believe this helped, especially in terms of Jamie Lee Curtis' character, as we saw she had real empathy for the kid who got tricked not so long ago (apparently she tried to visit him after he ended up in the hospital), along with strong disliking for the person whom she saw responsible for the prank, that being Doc, a self centered, manipulative type, mostly for his cruelty, but also because of the way he used her in his scheme.  The result of all this was an effort to make us feel for Curtis' character in that maybe she didn't deserve the same fate as the rest, and it work, for me at least.  The movie does fall within the `slasher' realm, but gore hounds will most likely be disappointed as there's actually very little bloodletting violence.  Spottiswoode, in his directorial debut, instead seems to be focusing on the suspenseful build up, rather than on the visceral material normally present within the genre.  I thought there was some very decent scares throughout the film...I didn't jump out of my seat or anything, but the movie did keep my attention.  The goofy bits for me was how well the killer was able to keep his identity hidden, even after those on the train realized who was the one responsible for the killings.  The story does throw around a red herring or two, but at one point, before his identity on the train is revealed, you should be able to discern which passenger he is...there was a definite sense of claustrophobia, as most of the film takes place on train that has only three or four cars, but then this also made the difficulty for those trying to find the killer seem all that much more, well, dumb.  One element that didn't really help was the amount of time spent watching David Copperfield perform his magic.  His character, who seemed quite smarmy to me, did figure into the plot, but it just felt like his lengthy performances were included to help pad out a decent running time.  I don't mind magic, but I would have  preferred there not to have been as much as there was since this was supposed to be a horror film.  It was kind of funny, though, given how seriously he takes his craft, to see him stuck on an excursion train having to impress a bunch of drunken college kids.  I did like the bit after the main conductor, played Ben Johnson, discovered the first body and attributes the death as being caused by `some kid messed up on dope'.  As far as Ms. Curtis, her presence here did help a lot, and probably resulted in quite a few seats being filled at the time of the movie's release given her prominence of `Scream Queen' in the late 1970s/early 1980s (she had all of three films out in 1980...this one, along with The Fog and Prom Night).  Overall I found this to be a fairly engaging film, one that rises slightly above that of your run-of-the-mill slasher feature.

The picture quality, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks decent enough, and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital mono and stereo comes across well.  There's really not much in the way of extras other than a theatrical trailer for the film and subtitles, available in both English and Spanish.

360820,3,630179821X,"In 1979's TERROR TRAIN, pre-med students hold a masquerade party on a quaint old passenger train and are picked off one by one as a costumed maniac lurks about.  With this mediocre slasher flick, Director Roger Spottiswoode quite literally tried to ride the coattails of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN (1978). Indeed, the film was produced and released within a year of Carpenter's watershed flick, and Spottiswoode even borrowed his predecessor's star, Jamie Lee Curtis!

A first-rate cast does its best, but even good actors can only do so much when working with lame material.  TERROR TRAIN's biggest fault is the often excruciatingly slow pacing, and it doesn't help that the identity of the killer is telegraphed to the audience right from the opening scene.  Copious gore or a little T&A might've livened things up a little, but even these slasher requisites are kept to a minimum.

In addition to the talented players, TERROR TRAIN does have a few other qualities that almost redeem it.  Almost.  Gaffer Lou Bogue's lighting creates perfect highlights and shadows, turning the quaint steam train into a haunted house on rails, and John Alcott's gorgeous cinematography gives the whole thing a vivid sense of the Gothic.  But TERROR TRAIN is still, at best, just a footnote in the slasher sub-genre, and only ardent fans will not wish they could reclaim the 97 minutes they'll spend watching it.  (Of course, big-time fans of Ms. Curtis might also enjoy a run-through.)

The dual-sided no-frills DVD from Fox offers the film in both anamorphic-widescreen and full-screen versions, and the digital transfer is crisp, vibrant, and relatively clean.  Still, even at the low price of admission, most should be wary of forking over ANY cash for this one.

Note: The three-star rating is only for avid fans of slasher films.  For the average viewer, this film would rate at two stars.",1127779200,,1880,5.025806451612903
360821,3,630179821X,"Terror Train isn't the best example of an 80s slasher flick, but it certainly isn't the worst either.  Of course it's got Jamie Lee during the early horror phase of her career.  She's not given much to do that you haven't seen her do in Halloween, though she does use the ""F"" word this time out.  Another interesting point is the appearance(and disappearance and reappearance) of illusionist David Copperfield.  Copperfield doesn't really do the movie thing, and it kinda makes you wonder why he'd choose to be in Terror Train of all things.  Plotwise, it's pretty standard.  A fraternity prank lands a geeky guy in the sack with a dismembered corpse rather than Jamie Lee, who he was originally expecting to devirginize him(a rather extreme and demented prank if I may say), thus driving him to madness.  Well, we all know that when tramatizing pranks and pranks gone awry are done to children and nerds, you've got the blueprints for some deadly revenge.  See Prom Night, Carrie and The Toxic Avenger for a couple more examples.  The murders are carried out during a costume party on a train.....The TERROR TRAIN.  There's no secret to who's doing the killing, you know from the start.  That's not the gag though, the gag isn't so much who the killer is, but where the killer is.  The movie spends a great deal of time pointing the finger at Copperfield's character, but it's forced upon us so much that it's obvious that he's the only one you can be sure isn't the killer.  The trick to keeping the killer a mystery is the fact that he dons the costume of his most recent victim.  This keeps him moving through the train pretty freely.  This is also probably the only original thing about the film as well.  Terror Train is best viewed in the wee hours of the morning over one of those microwavable chicken cordon bleu thingees and a room temperature of 76 degrees.

360825,2,630179821X,"Before writing a review for ""Terror Train,"" I decided to peruse Jamie Lee Curtis's filmography to test out a theory. I believed that the atrociousness of ""Terror Train"" likely was the straw that broke the camel's back, thus leading this actress away from her horror film roots and into new territory that she would subsequently mine quite successfully for the next twenty plus years. I think my theory proves correct, at least in part. Before making this movie, Curtis starred in ""Halloween,"" ""The Fog,"" and ""Prom Night."" After ""Terror Train,"" she made ""Halloween II."" And that was it as far as horror went until she reprised her role as Laurie Strode in a couple of the latter stage ""Halloween"" sequels in 1998 and 2002. I compliment her for moving beyond what was obviously posing a grave threat to her burgeoning career, namely her status as a slasher scream queen. If she had kept making horror movies, perhaps starring in a ""Terror Train 2"" or something similar, we would be reading about her in one of those ""Where are they now?"" articles. Don't get me wrong; I like Curtis's horror film portrayals in ""Halloween"" and ""The Fog."" What I don't like are films like ""Terror Train.""

A truly unimaginative slasher, ""Terror Train"" sets up its premise early on. A bunch of college freshmen--Alana Maxwell (Curtis), Doc Manley (Hart Bochner), and a couple of other bland faces I can't place at the moment--play a particularly nasty prank on one Kenny Hampson (Derek McKinnon), a geek whose demeanor and appearance practically begs for abuse. Rightly ascertaining that Kenneth hasn't been with a woman, the members of the fraternity he's pledging to send him up to a room where Maxwell awaits his presence. But there's a catch. Alana has no intention of bedding the gullible Kenny, so she hides behind the door to watch him embrace a cadaver those merry fraternity pranksters copped from the medical school. Hampson predictably freaks out, spinning around and around on the bed getting all wrapped up in a bunch of gauzy curtains. Sure, it's a mean spirited prank, but Kenny flips out in a permanent sort of way and heads for a free vacation at the mental motel. Life goes on for Maxwell, Manley, and the rest of the kids involved in the gag until their senior year. It is then that the group rents a train for one last alcohol-fueled bash before moving on with their lives.

How is it possible to stage a bloody massacre in the narrow confines of a train? It's not easy, so director Roger Spottiswoode and writer T. Y. Drake throw in a contrived scenario in which all of the kids don costumes while partying the night away. Ahhh, a costume party! See, this way the killer can wear a mask and go unnoticed while he kills his prey! How clever! Anyway, people start dropping almost immediately, with one kid dying outside in the snow while his friends board the train. Once inside, the movie moves about as fast as the train. We're treated to interminable stretches of mind numbing boredom as the camera moves from group to group for bouts of yawn inducing dialogue. A magician named Ken (David Copperfield) shows up to provide entertainment and look and act weird, and a train conductor called Carne (Ben Johnson) ambles about offering sage advice to anyone who'll listen for more than a second. Occasionally the movie reminds us we're watching a horror movie with a relatively bloodless kill or two, but the murders come too few and far between to help this train wreck. Lots of screaming and running around sends the signal that the film is coming mercifully to a close. The end.

I'd like to advocate a new policy concerning DVDs right now. For films like ""Terror Train,"" I think Congress ought to pass a federal law requiring a sticker attached to the cover of the DVD case that says, ""This movie stinks!"" That way I can avoid unpleasant experiences like this one and move on the next load of schlock that much faster. Geez, where to start with the terror that is ""Terror Train""? Well, the performances are mediocre, with only Jamie Lee and Ben Johnson turning in anything that smacks of a passing resemblance to acting. David Copperfield, I must say, should never, ever consider appearing in another movie. He's about as lifeless as road kill here, and what's up with that haircut? He looks like he's wearing a motorcycle helmet. But it's not just the performances that sink the film; it's the lack of carnage. What is this, a 'PG' rated film? I saw more blood when I skinned my knee back in the third grade than I did anywhere in this mess. If you're looking for an axe in the head, a machete making a meaty thwacking noise as it enters young flesh, or extended periods of arterial splashing...well, look elsewhere because you won't find it here.

The only extra on the disc is a trailer for the film, and for once I'm not complaining. I wouldn't want to listen to a commentary or see behind the scenes footage. The movie is far too boring to merit such special treatment. I planned on giving ""Terror Train"" one star, but I'm going to kick it up a notch for one scene that actually does manage to work up a bit of suspense and, dare I say, terror. The part in question involves Jamie Lee hiding in a cage screaming her head off while the killer jumps around outside breaking the light fixtures and generally ranting and raving because he can't reach his prey. One scene doesn't redeem the film, however. I recommend giving this one a wide berth--just watch ""Halloween"" or ""The Fog"" again if you want to feed your Jamie Lee Curtis cravings.",1121126400,,5541,4.6683725690890485
360826,2,630179821X,"I rented this film to see young people getting stabbed by a madman. There is some of that here, but not enough. Instead you get to see a lot of David Copperfield's magic tricks. He makes cards appear in his hand, he makes a woman float in the air, he puts a cigarette through a coin, and so on. I think I want my money back.

The film begins with a cruel prank that some medicine students do to one of their classmates. Three years later they go on a train to celebrate new year's eve. On the train people start to get killed. One would think that everything taking place on a train would give you a claustrofobic feeling, but that is not used at all. It hardly ever even feels narrow. That's a waste. Why let the action take place on a train if there is no difference?

There is virtaully no action apart from the murders. One just waits for the killer to strike, there is nothing else to look forward to. No one has any plans, and apart from people talking (about nothing) or making out, no one is doing anything. Well, David Copperfield is of course making his tricks, and people watch him, but the only thing that is really moving in any direction is the train.

The music to the film doesn't sound very 80's. It sounds more like an older horror film and it's rather annoying. On the other hand it's fun to hear the band on the train play their late 70's/early 80's music. Too bad it's not the band's music you here when the killer is doing his business.

If you want to see what Jamie Lee Curtis was doing between Halloween and Halloween 2, I guess this is the answer. She plays a really sweet character in this film. But that may be the only good reason to watch it. It just feels so slow.",1119052800,,1695,4.206153846153846
360827,3,630179821X,"Director:  Roger Spottiswoode

Cast:  Jamie Lee Curtis, Ben Johnson, Hart Bochner, David Copperfield.

Running Time:  97 minutes.

Rated R for violence, language, nudity, and some gore.

Jamie Lee Curtis returns once again in this early 1980's rip-off of the highly successful independent film ""Halloween"". The basic principle of this slasher flick is archaic, taking place on a New Year's Eve party train hosted by a college fraternity.  Everyone is having a great time and living the night up until bodies start piling up.  Ben Johnson and Jamie Lee Curtis head the bunch of hunted victims who embarrassed the shameful killer years before, who happens to be back now to endure his revenge.

Similar to the likes of ""Black Christmas"" and ""Halloween"", ""Terror Train"" does not use huge amounts of gory violence to get its thrills, but instead implements stylish camera angles that enhance the jolts and jumps when the killer appears.  Magician David Copperfield guest stars as a traveling magical showman who has more to do with the murders than first believed.  Curtis is only tolerable in her role and the subplots are predictable and somewhat tedious; however, director Roger Spottiswoode succeeds in producing some extremely exciting chase scenes that unfold to a surprising, intense climax.  Will certainly be enjoyed by fans of the genre and males who want to get a cute date to snuggle closer.",1117670400,,1399,5.110132158590308

This movie carried a ring of realism that this could actually happen in it. One can easily relate to one character or another. I would recommend this movie to fans of the first Friday the 13th movie, Halloween 1,2, H2O, My Bloody Valentine and Prom Night. If you are a big fan of the superkillers franchises like Feddy Krueger,Jason and the Jamie Lee Curtisless Halloweens, then you may not like this one.

I had no idea who the killer was all throughout the movie. the ending is shocking. but I liked it. and I am glad that she starred in this. in my thoughts it's not easy to make a train ride scary. but the director pulled this off well. the dark shots in the train added to the creepiness cuz you never knew when the killer would pop out or where. I recommend Halloween movies if you like Jamie Lee Curtis. that and Prom Night.

He freaks out and starts screaming. The next scene is three years later with the same students are getting ready to graduate. In celebration they decide to have a party on a train. However, someone else boards the train and students start turning up dead.

David Copperfield plays the magician.

360902,3,630179821X,"This is basically a bunch of kids having a costume party on a train.  Lucky thing about the costumes, as this allows the killer to walk around unnoticed.  As someone else said, the movie consists of a bunch of scenes of kids talking, then the conductor talking to the train crew, then the kids watching a magic show, more kids talking, more magic, then a lot of scenes with the train conductor talking to the kids.  Somewhere sandwiched in between all that is the ocassional kill.  I couldn't believe the amount of David Copperfield scenes in this thing.  It's more than obvious that the film makers were banking on him being a huge draw for the audience.  Now it just makes the movie seem incredibly dated.

There aren't any real scares, and the revenge motive of the killer is quite silly.  A prank is pulled on him, and to everyone's surprise, he decides to start doing a bunch of pirouettes while standing under some loose draperies, thereby nearly hanging himself.  Nobody to blame but his own laughable stupidity.  Jamie Lee Curtis' character motivation seems very odd as well - she holds a grudge against the head fraternity guy for years just because he was responsible for the prank which really shouldn't have hurt anybody, but the guy started spinning under the drapes.  I mean, who would anticipate that some guy would start spinning around when he got surprised?

The only good part of the movie is the atmoshpere on the train.  It could have been a good movie, but the focus on the train conductor character seemed very odd and none of the characters were sympathetic, not that we even got to know them at all.",1101081600,,1624,4.636363636363637

She has gone on since then to show an immense diversity and talent in such films as TRUE LIES, MOTHER'S BOYS and FREAKY FRIDAY.  However, after HALLOWEEN, Jamie did films like this and PROM NIGHT; hey why not milk a good thing?  Jamie does well in this lurid little thriller, but she's not quite as innocent as in her other outings.  She's part of a fraternity prank that makes an effeminate loner named Kenny (Derek McKinnon) goe bonkers.  Fast forward to three years later and now Jamie and her pre-med friends are on a specially rented train to celebrate their successes.  Oscar winner Ben Johnson (THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) is on board as the venerable engineer; his performance is lethargic and needed someone more spirited like Jonathan Harris or Peter Cushing.  Hart Bochner (SUPERGIRL, APARTMENT ZERO, LIBERTY STANDS STILL) is the handsome Doc, the perpetrator of the Kenny scheme, and he's not changed a bit.  Jamie is hooked up with Mo (Timothy Webber), a worthless friend of Doc's; and the magical talents of David Copperfield are wasted, as his presence, other than a potential red herring.

Someone of course wants revenge for Kenny and has managed to sneak on the train and is offing the participants in this heinous prank.  I have to admit that when I saw this the first time back in the 80s, I was fooled by the identity.  It's still a good surprise, even though if one looks at the killer's fingernails in a near climax killing, you'll soon figure it out.

The movie is not bad for a slasher film, but its direction and performances are wooden, and it ends rather abruptly.  Not bad though.",1098057600,,1698,4.73469387755102
360905,5,630179821X,"I remember watching TERROR TRAIN on television at various points in my childhood. I even taped it off of FX five years ago. And now TERROR TRAIN is finally out on DVD and looks better than ever! This movie is just too cool!

Jamie Lee Curtis, one of the best actresses ever to appear in horror movies, is a member of a fraternity of pre-med students who are celebrating a New Year's Eve costume party on board an old-fashioned steam train with Ben Johnson as the conductor. But the party is crashed by a pledge that was subjected to a humiliating prank three years prior. He kills each pledge involved in the prank and disguises himself with the victim's costume. Oh, and David Copperfield is on hand to provide magic to the guests with help from Vanity (aka D.D. Winters).

TERROR TRAIN is terrifying without being overly gruesome, relying on the aftermaths of the killings for any blood. The opening prank alone has the impact of any of Tom Savini's fine effects in FRIDAY THE 13TH. Curtis is great as usual, but Johnson steals the show as the conductor that gets caught in the middle of the mayhem. The highlight of TERROR TRAIN, showcased in the widescreen version, is the camera work from John Alcott who is best known for his work with my favorite director, Stanley Kubrick; Alcott adds the right level of tension and suspense to this film, especially during the climax!

TERROR TRAIN is required viewing for slasher fans and Kubrick buffs alike!",1097712000,,1452,4.6640625
360906,5,630179821X,"""Terror Train"" was one of my favorite slasher pics from the 80's but I haven't seen it in nearly 20 years!  Even more thrilling than finding it on DVD was seeing it again.  Wow! This movie still works.  The plot is pretty straight forward - psychopath gets revenge on college pranksters, but the combination of the train setting, costume New Years Eve party, and dark winter atmosphere results in an excellent equation.

Jamie Lee Curtis was riding high as the horror queen at the time this was made, fresh off of ""The Fog"" & ""Halloween 1 & 2"".  As a skilled actress, she definitely brings something more to her roles in these pics than anyone else would have.

Another reason I love this movie is because it features VANITY!  Only here she is billed as DD Winters (the same name she used for the soft core romp 'Tonya's Island').  She has a decent sized role and light ups the screen in her sexy Cleopatra costume.  After ""Terror Train"" she hooked up with Prince and became Vanity, then maintained a film career into the early 90's.

Most of the slasher pics that came from the 80's can easily be dismissed as cable filler, but ""Terror Train"" is not one of them.  It's not as scary as ""Texas Chainsaw"" but it does offer enough thrills to please any horror fan.",1097712000,,1261,4.4868421052631575

Little do they know, someone has killed one of their pals and taken his place! So, one by one, he fools his victims into getting close enough to kill. Then, he puts on their costume and assumes their identity (It's a neat trick, and is similar in effect to the scene in Halloween where P.J. Soles mistakes Michael for her boyfriend)!

360969,4,630179821X,"Terror Train was one of those slashers of the 1980's that followed the usual formula: Killer in a claustrophic setting, donning a costume that can be particularly scary (in this case many), and chasing after teen girls that are all about partying and sex. This one works rather well in the genre due to its gloominess, its setting both on and off the train, and idea of using a costume party and magic to hide the identity of the killer, which i thought failed. I knew who the bugger was right off the bat, or the axe for this case. Once again this is one of those dark atmosphere Canadian slasher films like ""Prom Night"", and my personal favorite ""Curtains"". Roger Spottiswoode did a great job on the scenery as the train chugged through the countryside. Cinematography in this film was lush and the winter time gave it all the more of a depressing, somber setting.

Jaime Lee Curtis was midway down the road of her long list of slasher and horror films that she did during the 80's, and this one is one of her better ones. I think that the acting was fair, good performances by Curtis and Ben Johnson as the conductor. I think that i had first seen this film on Cinemax sometime in late 1987, and i do rememeber that it was around the holidays. They usually show horror films on their respective holiday setting, or title, around here.

I think that Terror Train was an effective thriller, that didn't need buckets of blood to get the job done. Although i do think that the hazing idea was used too much, and to a better effect in the 80's than this film. I do believe that it does accomplish what it set out to do, and that was to give the viewer a train ride into horror. I do think that the plot and story was a little on the weak side, but the execution of the film was very well done. Terror Train should definitely be in the collection of ""Holiday Horror"" for any of you horror hounds out there like myself. Definitely a film to watch for a weekend. ****

I convinced my wife (with the bribe of a backrub) to watch this one with me, and even though she hates horror films she agreed. I pop in the dvd....and with some annoying teen banter before the opening credits, it starts. But I didn't give up hope, I mean if you watch the first 10 minutes of ""Hell Night"", and judge the film on those scenes alone you would turn it right off, missing out on a great slasher flick, so I hung in there with Terror Train figuring it would get better. Sadly, it doesn't. As a matter of fact, it gets so painfully bad to watch, you get embarassed for the cast. You have the most awful comedy relief guy here, who luckily gets it pretty quickly, you have the tramp, the good girl, the arrogant jerk, in short all of the popular horror movie cliches are well represented. Which is okay, I mean that is what I want and expect from a horror flick. BUT...you also get David Copperfield. Now I would hate to be stuck on a train with a serial killer, but it would be really horrifying to be stuck on a train with a killer and David Copperfield. So in between Copperfield's lounge act, you get a guy killing people in a deformed Groucho Marx mask, not the height of terror for sure. Jamie Lee gets to run around and ply her patented scream, which is where my 2 stars come from, and that's about it. I hated to see Ben Johnson end up in this thing. Such a great character actor shouldn't have been relegated to this embarassment. I don't know what scared me about this movie when it came out, there really aren't any suspenseful moments, the script is lousy, the pseudo-mystery is laughable, and the special effects aren't even up to early 80's expectations.

SO.....what I learned from watching Terror Train is:

1. Pre-View any movie you have to convince your wife to watch, or you'll never live it down.

2. When watching Jamie Lee Curtis Horror films, stick to the more popular, ""The Fog"", ""Halloween"", ""Prom Night""

360974,2,630179821X,"I debated whether or not to even bother writing a review for this much forgotten piece of horror cheese from 1980. Why bother?. Well, after seeing ""Prom Night"" for the first time in a few years, I thought I would take a look at the Jamie Lee Curtis Scream Queen ouevre. So, why not?. While this film is a tad better than ""Prom Night"", it still isn't much of anything. As I have stated in older horror reviews I have done, I grew up on total camp like this and I have a deep fondness for types of films like these. Even when it's bad, I still enjoy them. Jamie Lee continues her role as Scream Queen, after already appearing in the granddaddy of films, ""Halloween"". She quickly followed that up with the brilliant ""The Fog"", and the already mentioned ""Prom Night"". Jamie Lee really gets to be the queen in this film after not getting the chance to really do the part in 'Prom'. The film opens with a teen filled party. Jamie Lee and a group of other kids set up a nerdy outsider of a kid for a doozy of a practical joke. After the horrible events that happened that night, we skip ahead and are now witnessing a group of the same teens boarding a train. It's graduation and they are getting a train trip as a graduation gift. And, wouldn't you know it, a madman has hoped aboard the train and stalks it's thin, crowded hallways. Is the mysterious stranger the nerdy kid out for revenge?. Is it somebody completely new that is stalking them?. Do you care?. Probably not. The screenplay doesn't make much out of the mystery and doesn't live up to the ""who is it?"" scenario, and your interest is long gone before the movie really gets going. Speaking of the movie getting going, it never really does. There isn't a whole lot to do aboard a train. There aren't that many spaces and places to go, so it makes for a very dull movie that moves like molasses. It is basically filled with cliched interplay between the teenage passengers, and random shots of passengers and the killer walking to and fro in the hallways and rooms. A kill here and there will pop up to liven things up, but the scenes cause little to no fear or tension. It just all adds up to a lot of useless scenes of partying, dancing, talking, and an occassional glimpse of a figure walking. Having said that, I can say that there is one moment in the film that does succeed and raise fun and some tension. The climax of the film, between Jamie Lee and the killer, is pretty good. The chase and the trap that Jamie Lee finds herself in while in a wire cage/office is quite effective. If only the rest of the movie could of been filled with as much spark as the chase scene, it would of made for a better film. Okay, maybe not a good film, but it would of livened up the thing a bit. The casting is odd. Respected veteran actor Ben Johnson appears as the film's conductor and gets top billing, even though it is obvious a supporting role that doesn't add to much. Why Mr. Johnson?. Hart Bochner appears as the typical jock/jerk. At least he oozes the smarmy machoism that these characters are seeped with. And most strange, and some might add, scariest of all, is the appearance of magician David Copperfield. It isn't much, and it generates little thrills and not much else to the genre. Still, a little 80's horror camp does the heart good every once in a while.",1074384000,,3323,4.361290322580645

361028,4,630179821X,"Lets just start off with a blanket statement that is unequivocal; I typically DESPISE ""slasher"" films. Oh, I worship every frame of Halloween (1978, which is classic cinema period) and had fun seeing Friday the 13th (1980) for the first time and going BOO! But I don't go to see ""dead teenager"" movies, don't rent them, and don't care. I didn't even like Red Dragon with Ralph Fiennes as a very worthy screen monster; I don't want to get to know mad killers, I want to see them smacked over the head with a coal shovel and done away with.

I first saw Terror Train quite by chance -- sleepover party at a friends in 1981 at the age of 14 where a bottle got passed around. Everyone else zonked out; I snuck upstairs to watch HBO on his parent's big screen TV set, and what  did they happen to show, but Terror Train.

I had never seen a movie like it before. We had whispered to each other in the hallways of our middle school about Jason Vorhees and his mad mother, but I had never seen a film where some maniac runs around with an ax chasing comely college girls before. It was something new and sensational, and as usual my memory of the film proved to be more lurid than what actually turned up in my mailbox after buying the now out of print film from an Amazon.com reseller.

Terror Train follows the proven formula of building up a descent into madness and violence: A young fraternity pledge is subjected to a horrifying initiation stunt and goes bonkers. Cut to three years later and his now graduating pre-med classmates are staging an elaborate New Year's Eve costume party on a chartered excursion train, The completely psychotic former pledge gets on board via an elaborate ruse to murder his way through the principal cast members who set him up. The gimmick is that since everyone is wearing identity concealing costumes he can pretend to be someone else while getting close to his prey. The result are some truly unsettling scenes of mistaken identity and a final denoument that is completely out of left field, unexpected, and refreshingly final in it's closing act. There was no Terror Train 2, nor should there have been.

The film is known mostly these days as a post-Halloween Jamie Lee Curtis screamer fest, and on that level has developed a cult following of such (being out of print also helps make a film a ""cult"" item; just try bidding for this tape on eBay sometime to see what I mean). Of more interest to film afficianados is the presence of first time director Roger Spottiswoode (a frequent editor of Sam Peckinpah's 1970's movies, and of later Stop! Or My Mom will Shoot! and Tomorrow Never Dies fame) and longtime Stanley Kubrick cameraman John Alcott filming the proceedings with a nice recurring motif of light vs. dark and truly haunting color schemes.

The result is a film that was better than it's genre demanded. Sure, the dialogue and performances are either wooden or hysterical, but the smoothness with which the story unfolds and sweeps those involved in the proceedings up is inspired and follows a path of logic. Screen legend Ben Johnson (probably doing Spottiswoode a favor; they certainly would have met while working with Peckinpah) is on hand to provide a calming authority figure for Jamie Lee to think things out with.

Also on hand is magician David Copperfield, playing a magician who resembles a waxwork figure. His presence in the film serves three roles; he annoys us, kills screen time with his disco music magic shows, and serves as a convenient red herring for the film's climax. And no, I didn't just give the killer's identity away.

Nor will I do so by saying that his name is Kenny, and he is apparently one resourceful little insane waife. Kenny is able to magically transport himself to different parts of the train to commit acts of mayhem while the person he is impersonating is somewhere else. He can apparently materialize inside of locked train compartments, and in one preposterous shot has the ability to crawl around on the outside of the train like a spider. The fact that he is on a mission of revenge and the people who he harms more or less ""had it coming to them"" makes him seem more like an avenging spirit at times, yet he is clearly a real person.

What the hell is going on here? I suspect that what Spottiswoode and his asscociate scriptwriters did is to actually craft a clever little nightmare of vengance or justice, propably playing in the guilt-ridden mind of Curtis' good girl character who was, of course, suckered into taking part in the prank that scarred Kenny. She also contends that he was sick to begin with in a revelation I didn't catch the first couple times through, and already had killed someone under suspicious circumstances prior to his hazing incident. Curtis is also put through such a visually compelling ordeal at the end that it suggests a nightmare unfolding in the vivid detail we see them in. And like a nightmare, the film comes to an abrupt end when Kenny's body smacks into the ice of a frozen river after being beaned over the brainpan with a shovel. There is no post script, no explanation, only a ridiculous closing theme playing over the credits. Kind of like waking up, and finding yourself right there in the same old bed all along.

I'm probably reading a certain amount of this into the film, but the fact remains that for it's genre, Terror Train was very well made and has some distinguished talent behind it. Notice I have not dwelled on topics like gore and nudity, mostly because they are used with restraint and only at times that make sense in the scope of the story. There is not a truly gratuitous moment in the script, which is also unique of it's kind. And once you get down to it, the fact that it never had a sequel is a sign that maybe they had an idea here that was too good to mess with once the final print was snapped into the can.

Amen for that.",1036281600,,5890,4.568181818181818
361029,4,630179821X,"Terror Train is another notch in Jamie ""Scream Queen"" Curtis' belt, and it's a good slasher with talent behind it and a lot atmosphere.
To begin with, the setting.  A fraternity decides to have a pre-graduation bash along a train that is travelling across what looks like the northeast or just plan north (maybe Canada) during a long night.  It's a costume party, so all are done up as giant lizards, swordsmen, ghouls etc.  One problem: a poor student they pulled a hideous prank on years earlier decides to crash it.  And he's wearing a costume, too.
One by one the knucklehead fraternity bros and sorority gals are getting bumped off in the usual fashion: knifed, brain-bashed, etc.  The killer dons the costume of each victim, keeping everyone guessing and scared.
Curtis is a pretty nice girl (of course), which leads to her inevitable siting and subsequent battle with the killer.  A couple of differences though: a member of the adults (the crusty train conductor played by Ben Johnson(!) is effective in battling the killer, too, and a decent revelation about the killer's identity, er, costume.
This flick has a lot of atmosphere.  John Alcott, who shot 3 Kubrick(!) classics, does the camerawork.  Director Spottiswoode would go on to better things, even a 007 film (Tomorrow Never Dies).  And Ben Johnson and Curtis are fine, as is Hart Bochner as the frat head (Bochner would go on to advance his slasher resume with a nice role in Urban Legends: Final Cut 20 years later) and just having David Copperfield play an entertaining magician is a bizarre touch that works.
A couple of gripes.  Given its slasher golden age appearance it could have upped the gore factor.  This was post-Halloween and the same year as Friday the 13th so I would have suspected more gore and style in the killing dept.  I mean, this killer is pissed, as you can imagine when the see the opening prank.  The second is not so much a gripe as a mixed feeling about some of the atmosphere.  Too often is works as pieces that don't make a whole--one minute the train is partying hard and there are people everywhere.  Then other times the place is empty with one or two or no people milling about.  This is a frat party with a mass of people on there!  Typically, the cast is so stupid that most of them don't suspect anything odd is going on as people begin to disappear.  Oh well.
I don't watch slasher films for logic, etc.  I like the atmosphere in this one (the lighting and the night, moving train setting) and the general setup and devices (like the costumes.)  Don't expect a lot of gore, but it does generate a bit more suspense and interest than many others of its kind.  Recommended.",1026950400,,2677,4.629237288135593
361030,4,630179821X,"The success of John Carpenter's 1978 suspense thriller HALLOWEEN spawned a whole rash of slasher films, now numbering in the hundreds, that have stained and drenched the screens in blood and gore.  The vast majority of these have been not just bad, but despicable and insulting.

Unlike most, however, the 1980 slasher film TERROR TRAIN has something to recommend to it.  Like a lot of slasher movies, the film begins with an extended prologue detailing a high-school student be the victim of a pretty nasty prank (a la CARRIE) who decides to get revenge on his classmates.

The difference here, however, is that the action takes place on a train going across the snowbound Canadian countryside, and it involves a fraternity party.  Everyone is dressed in costumes, but a lot of them soon start having this tendency of disappearing and later turning up dead.  The question becomes: Who is the killer?

HALLOWEEN veteran Jamie Lee Curtis once again takes on the role of the main hero/heroine imperiled here, and she does her usual, highly effective job.  The idea of setting the story on a train, having people (including magician David Copperfield) in costume, and making the audience guess in what disguise the killer has donned himself works wonders in lifting this film above its ilk.

But the talent behind TERROR TRAIN is very important as well.  The director is Roger Spottiswoode, a British film editor who worked with Sam Peckinpah on that director's 1971 horror film STRAW DOGS.  Ben Johnson, a veteran character actor of both Peckinpah and John Ford, is extremely good as the train conductor (he also won a Best Supporting Actor in 1971 for THE LAST PICTURE SHOW).  And the film's atmospheric cinematography is provided by John Alcott, who worked with Stanley Kubrick on 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and THE SHINING (and won an Oscar for his stellar work on Kubrick's BARRY LYNDON in 1975).

I dock the film one star due to some slightly mediocre acting amongst some of the other participants.  Otherwise, however, TERROR TRAIN is a highly suspenseful film that doesn't rely too terribly much on blood and gore to be atmospheric and chilling.",1013212800,,2166,4.931129476584022

The cinematography is rather well done and it makes the suspense a bit meatier as we travel the tracks to a slasher destiny.

It follows a group of medical school students who, during their freshman year, pull a practical joke that turns sour and ends up putting a boy in the hospital. Now, in their senior year, they host a New Year's Eve party on an excursion train, and someone has decided that retribution is going to be part of the party planning. This film is notable for a couple of things. First of all, it was shot on board an actual train, which was leased by the production company for the purpose. After shooting was complete, the train was reconditioned and went back into service, to still be running as of 2014. The second was the special appearance by the legendary David Copperfield as the magician hired to entertain the partygoers. This means that the film contains at least a handful of his illusions as part of the story.
