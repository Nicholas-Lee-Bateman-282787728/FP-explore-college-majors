As others have noted, a few of the scenes were moved around and there were some minor changes here and there but, for the most part, it's true to what Library Wars should be.  My usual experiences with movies created from manga/anime is that they're usually too different or fall completely flat when compared to their manga/anime counterparts.  This movie, however, exceeded my expectations and I thought it was actually better than the anime in some senses.  For me, the movie did a better job of explaining things, particularly the rules and regulations of the wars between the libraries and the media betterment committee.  I also thought the movie invested a little more time on the relationship between Kasahara and Dojo, which was a good thing as it gave a better sense of connection and feelings between the two main characters.  The movie moving a few scenes around, in my opinion, was actually a good thing because it gave the story a better flow.  The actors/actresses all did really well with their roles.  I especially liked Junichi Okada(he's been cast in a few more police/military-type roles more lately) as the stiff and uptight Atsushi Dojo.  One thing I noted is that the characters in the movie did appear a little older than the ones in the anime but that's not at all a bad thing.  I'm super glad they didn't cast a bunch of young actors and actresses for these roles as it really did give the movie a proper, mature feeling.

Even if you haven't seen the anime, if you're at least familiar with Japanese movies/dramas, you'll probably still enjoy this movie.  Overall, it contains a really good balance of drama, action, romance, and even some spots of comic relief.  This particular blu-ray version is the Hong Kong version, not the one from Japan(sadly, the one from Japan doesn't have any English subs), but it is an authentic product meaning that the quality of the film is nothing short of excellent and the subtitles are done very well.  It is a region A blu-ray so it can play on any blu-ray player in the US and it's in the original Japanese language with the option of English or Chinese subs.",1461024000,3,2175,4.689473684210526
8639698,5,B00I7ST2YM,"This live action version follows the anime version fairly well.  The actors seem well cast, and the English subtitles are generally much better than I had expected.  The video quality is fine.  The ending winds up one plot element, but leaves much open for a sequel, which I hope to see someday.  But watch the anime series as well!",1456531200,2,332,4.576271186440678
