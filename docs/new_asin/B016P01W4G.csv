7476780,5,B016P01W4G,"Pixar presents a heart warming 3D tale of a lost Dinosaur, Arlo, seeking the courage to face his fears and find his family, and his best friend, a tiny human who comically captures the traits of a dog more than a human, appropriately named Spot. The scenery is stunning in its artistry and realism, nicely contrasted with the more cartoonish features of the characters and dinosaurs.
Pixar steps out of the comfort zone, showing some mild cartoon violence of Spot taking apart a bug he's about to feed to his friend, along with cute critters becoming snacks for some other dinosaurs. In summary, the 3D is outstanding beyond expectations from Pixar's previous 3D entries, with a constant serving of above average depth, dimension and even some nice pop outs, blending with a beautiful adventure of a dino and his pet, journeying through the dangerous wilderness of an alternate time where the extinction event never happened. Don't miss it.",1448668800,10,940,4.955696202531645

7476830,1,B016P01W4G,"Horrible movie, extremely violent. I regret purchasing this and it has completely evaporated the blind faith I had in Pixar.
Low points:

- Violence (constant death threats to and from the main characters)
- Drug use (yes... wtf I know), complete with nightmarish ""acid trip"" scene where the characters' heads warp and grow extra eyeballs and so on.
- Dark themes of starvation, parental death, etc

To top it off, this movie had:
- Cliche about manly macho father who forces his son to do dangerous and violent things.
- Bullying older brother who was literally born hitting his parents and siblings (major ""boys will be boys"" violence here).
- Little boy character who is just a dog in a boy body, no interesting personality whatsoever.

The final insult, however, is that iT IS REALLY FREAKING BORING. Yes: this movie is EXTREMELY BORING with long monotonous scenes of characters walking around and dull dialogue about crops and weather.

7476844,1,B016P01W4G,"This had to be one of the worst animated Disney movies ever, and I've seen some lulus (The Black Cauldron, anyone?).  We saw it in the theater when it was first released without checking any reviews, because Disney had done such a nice job with Inside Out and Big Hero Six.  What a mistake, to go without reading some reviews first.  The premise, that a ""child"" dinosaur had to do something to ""prove himself"" to put his footprint on the family wall seemed to imply that he needed to earn love and worth, something no child should have to go through, though I know many do, unfortunately.  The fact that family tragedy ensues as a result of his ""failure"" to do his job merely adds to the poor message of this film.  While Spot (the prehistoric human) was cute, that was the only redeeming part of the film for me.  The story was so boring, punctuated with moments of horrified shock, such as (SPOILER) when the storm-""worshiping"" pteranodons ""rescue"" a cute little mammal,only to devour it in front of the min character.  The tyrannosaurs talk about bloody kills as well, and there is a scene in which the two main characters eat rotten fruit and have a drug-trip kind of experience.  The scenery, while impressive, is less so when you realize it's photography, not animation.  Young ones may be too scared by the violence and anyone older than 9 will be bored by the rest.  Pass on this one.",1519862400,,1392,4.554216867469879

7476867,1,B016P01W4G,"Nothing about this movie makes any sense and it does not deserve the Disney or Pixar label.  Sure the animation at points is great... but for a movie to be good, it needs good characters (like in the movie Incredibles), a good story (like in the movie Cars), and a plot line that makes sense to both kids and adults even the plot twists (like in Monster's Inc.)  You cannot have action just for action's sake, it has to be an integral part of the story.  You cannot have sudden plot twists unless it fits the story perfectly, otherwise you jar your audience out of the movie magic.  You cannot do things that make everyone say ""did they really go there?"" or do things so brain numbingly stupid that no can laugh at it.  Oh and if its a movie for young children... then you better have everything wrap up nearly in the end and not put anything in it so the kiddos scream from nightmares all night long (for example: Monsters Inc. did a great job of making monsters not scary and ended on a very happy note).  HOWEVER, The Good Dinosaur movie meets NONE of that.  Seriously NONE of that.  Our family agrees across the board that this is one of the absolute worst movies we have ever seen.  I will explain all this below, but it may contain spoilers.

1.  There are some flying dinos who act like they are rescuing animals, then suddenly turn on the cute critters and eat them.  Then the one dino stands there with the cute animal's tail sticking out of its mouth while it talks.  Then these terrifying things go after the human child to eat it too.  Frankly these scenes are WAY too scary for young children.  The stealing cows dinos were terrifying too as they tried to eat the dino plus kid.  Since seeing this movie and those scary scenes, my little son has started having nightmares.  My precious son who loved dinos, is now terrified and screaming for help.  I did that to my son by letting him watch this movie.  I feel terrible that I trusted the Disney Pixar label.  So now, I going to make sure my son watches a lot of Dinosaur Train over the next months to replace those evil memories.

2.  Throughout the movie, the timing and situations were WAY too impossible to even believe.  Once an audience stops believing in a movie, then the magic is broken and the movie cannot succeed.  Movies always require a suspension of disbelief, a curtain if you will, that holds an audience in the story line where they will buy into and believe in things that would not normally happen in the real world.  Once that curtain is ripped down, then the movie no longer can entertain or be enjoyable.  My husband and I ended up rolling our eyes and staring at each other saying ""did they just do that?"", ""that is ridiculous!"", and ""who thought to write this?""  For example: We never believed that the dino and human child could communicate to each other via wood sculptures and drawn circles... and the time dragged on so long before the dino went to save the child that in our minds the kid was dead so seeing him alive just did not make any sense!  In fact, the only thing that ended up being believable was the dinos farming (crazy hunh?)

3.  How the T Rexes looked was jarring.  It was as if their necks were broken because they held them up so high.... with all those neck wrinkles.  Do some better updated science research in animal anatomy before making a film!

4.. There were unnecessary scenes only added in an attempt to force the young dino to mature or something, but ended up being jarring to the story line, not pleasant, and left more of a bad taste in your mouth.  For example: the T Rexes around the campfire talking about biting through their own tails AND leaving an alligator tooth in their mouth was just beyond unnecessary and not enjoyable in any way.

5.  Seeing his dad and realizing he was a ghost because he had no footprints... and then the dino wakes up and the whole seeing his dad was just a dream.  Who has footprints or no footprints in a dream?  The audience and the dino would get that his dad was not there when he simply woke up and was alone!  There was no need to mention footprints at all!  How could the writers and producers not catch something that simple?  OR have the dad show up in the real world not a dream where the no footprints would make sense.

6. When it was the perfect time for the human child to leave and join other humans.... they don't let the human go so you have to rehash that letting go all over AGAIN at a not that far off point in the movie.  Just get it over with the first time!  Also, why does that family have white hair?  They are not albinos or old so it made no sense.

7.  At the begining of the movie, the dino mom tells her son to work extra hard to bring in the harvest before winter or they will all die.  The mom looks exhausted and as she asks this she practically collapses giving you the idea she is facing death if she pushes anymore.  So the son goes to do his job and work harder for the sake of his mom's health and all, but then he ends up falling in a river and gets lost... lost so far away from his farm that it will take a long time to get back... so by the end of the story, when he does he gets back.. The son has not helped bring in the harvest, his mom is still exhausted, and winter is at their doorstep.  The mom said they would die if her son did not push really hard to harvest all the corn and he was not there to harvest the corn so the audience is left with a feeling that the entire family is going to die in winter or at least the mom will die from over-exertion.... so you cannot feel even happy about the ending.

8.  The dino that seems to use telepathy to communicate to other creatures is in my opinion culturally insensitive.  The dino looks crazy and terrified but also looks/feels native American.  I don't think it is appropriate to make a creature of any kind that associates a person's traditional culture with crazy and wanting to add the little boy to his collection of critters.  I just got really angry that this character was even approved.

I will stop my comments at that point... not because there is nothing else to say, but because the movie is so bad, there is way too much that could be written.  Keep in mind that I rarely write movie reviews and I do not often leave one star reviews.  I also own ALOT of kids movies esp Pixar and Disney movies, but also some anime and kids movies from the 1980s.  So even though I LOVE kids films and even go on date nights to see kids movies..... this film was one of the worst movies ever made period.",1515888000,2,6559,4.2725060827250605

7476872,1,B016P01W4G,"This movie was terrible.  Our two year old loves dinosaurs, so we thought it would be a nice movie for all of us to see.  There is a lot of hardship and depression in this movie, with very little happiness/excitement to balance it out.  It's too serious to be a kid's movie.  ALSO, it is completely inappropriate to have Arlo and Spot getting high off of funny mushrooms!!! This is supposed to be a kids' movie!!!",1515369600,,413,4.394736842105263

A wonderful experience for all ages.  The story is masterfully written with humor and pathos for the characters.  The character development is complex and multi-faceted.  The characters are an expression of all our desires, fears, foibles, sorrows, and even baser instincts in some cases.  It is a story of the bonds between family and those of friendship and how pre-eminent those bonds are to our well-being and survival.  Do not miss seeing this film!",1512345600,2,616,5.34375

For a Pixar film, the story disappointingly lacking in depth and creativity. But even so, we really enjoyed this movie! My four year old was too creeped out by a lot of the scary dinosaurs, so she bailed halfway through, but myself and my 7 and 9 year old kids really liked it!

It is a good classic children's movie that anyone can watch. While it was a weird film in regards to Pixar, it has a good message. One of the strong points in the movie is that the character went on a journey that showed him growing from a scared child to a mature one. In one scene, he was told that it was okay to be scared even if he wanted to be brave, it's normal. I think it would be a good movie to show to children who ever doubt themselves, just because they do not live up to certain expectations.
Even as a college kid, this movie gives a sense of relief that life happens and maybe you aren't as good as others, but you gotta push through and embrace the beauty of life.",1496707200,,704,4.101449275362318

7476990,1,B016P01W4G,"Yeah, I know, most kids' movies kick off with dead parents, but this movie just keeps sucking after that. Everything sucks. You have to watch every. Exquisite. Detail. Of injury. After injury. And attempts to move after injuries. And close-ups of the grotesquely injured body parts. I get it. Nature's terrible. So the good dinosaur's dad is mean to him, to toughen him up so he'll survive, which, ironically, is what causes dad's death. Hilarious!

More than once, we watch a predator maim its prey, then linger on close up shots of it clinging to life. And/or getting dismembered. I mean... I'm trying not to be too squishy about this, but sweet chocolate jeezy, my kids (who play Halo, dissect frogs in Biology class, are comfortable with fairly brutal nature documentaries - they range from ages 10 to 17) were as disgusted, annoyed, and bewildered as I was. The grotesqueries aside, the elements that were intended to be humorous were so flagrantly, confusingly weird, that I guess I could recommend this movie if you need something to howl at hysterically at 3 AM after smoking a large dose of glaucoma medicine. Like, seriously. I'm watching it now, and in the last 5 minutes, we've gone from the children getting drunk and hallucinating, to a maudlin scene of them making a stick-doll family and pretending they're their real, dead family members. Aaaaand now we're on a nightmare flasback of dad's death. And now the characters are lost. Good GAWD. This movie can't end soon enough. This isn't an adventure. This is a series of unrelated events that alternate between stuff that sucks and stuff that makes no sense.

The thousands of 5-star reviews are really making me question... pretty much everything. I'm terrified of anyone who enjoyed this.",1493337600,2,1756,4.909090909090909

7476998,2,B016P01W4G,"Pixar (save for the Cars franchise) has been great at making edgy films of a huge array of themes. Unfortuantely, The good dinosaur just seems like it will be one of those films nobody will remember 20 years from now.

What is the plot? Basically it's pretty much the same thing as Ice Age 1 without charming characters and makes less sense.

The dinosaur is an apatosaurus named Arlo that oddly enough works in a family farm (yes, a dinosaur that has flat feet doing fine manual tasks, here comes the first oddball blunder of this film). He has a poor relationship with his family for no apparent reason except that his father Henry is a complete heartless jerk and runs off. The father tries to rescue him when he gets trapped in the forest and dies (yes this film is rather violent despite the childish character designs and less stylish artwork). Arlo manages to escape but he is lost and can't find home.

After some misshaps, he locates a human toddler that he names Spot and then I guess he decides to find a home for the little child and return home.

I'm not sure what the age group this film is directed at: little kids or grown adults. The movie is too dark and violent for little kids (I found Arlo's character to be selfish and completely unlikeable but the film tried to treat him as a flawless hero), Spot is just sort of riding on his back without doing much and yet at the same time, the plot has a lot of plot flaws that makes it unappealing to older viewers.

Humans apparently aren't very smart creatures, but they are smart enough to create clothes from animal fur. Arlo's family have flat feet but they work as farmers without having a hard time building a fancy wooden cabin. Arlo doesn't stray very far from home but he can't seem to locate the river that rests right next to his farm. Carnivore dinosaurs herd herbivore mammals that don't fear these ferocious beasts. The dinosaurs in this film don't wear clothes, so why do they herd cattle?

I really don't understand why this film has so many 5 stars reviews, the movie doesn't seem to know what it is aimed at. Edgy experimental art film? I really don't know, but Ice Age I has a similar plot with far more likeable characters.",1492214400,,2206,4.461538461538462

7477008,2,B016P01W4G,"I don't know how this movie is rated so high. Yes, it's Pixar, but it's NOT up to their usual quality.

The Good Dinosaur is bizarre. Don't expect a cute little dinosaur movie. This is a Western. I kid you not, it's a Western.

The Apatosaurs are homesteaders, the T-Rexes are Cowboys/Cattlemen, the Pterosaurs are outlaws and the Raptors are Cattle Rustlers. And it all comes complete with Texas accents, tall tales accompanied by harmonica around a campfire, and a western musical score. Actually, when the movie begins, you can't really tell it's a Western. It just slowly morphs as the movie goes on.

Other things contribute to the strangeness of the movie. The animation is beautifully photorealistic, but the characters don't match the scenery. They're cartoony and silly. The human character, Spot, is the main dinosaur's pet, and it's strangely off-putting.

If the dinosaurs had adaptations it would have made more sence that theyd be able to make tools but they dont. Just big chunky feet.

The CGI is beautiful, but it's strange why they chose to make the environment so realistic but make the characters still very cartoonish. I was also disappointed to see so many integral parts of the movie's plot were taken from The Lion King. It felt like the Disney Graphic Artists just wanted to try out some new effects and so they invented a movie to do so. And, why is the human acting like a dog??? I think it would have been better if the human was just acting more like a caveman that wasn't evolved enough to be a true human but was more like a pet.

7477044,5,B016P01W4G,"We are fortunate to live at a time when there is such great family fare as The Good Dinosaur. There are so many good animated family features every year now. It wasn't always this way. And for Arlo, the good dinosaur of the title, the fact that times both change us and our environs is a good thing too. You see Arlo is a big fraidy cat like many a child and even some adults. He is afraid of his shadow, of noises, and even of chickens (or what pass as the equivalent of chickens in his prehistoric time). Arlo is an Apatosaurus (older folk, think of a Brontosaurus) and he marvels at the strength and immensity of dad, and even big brother and sister. This gentle farming family wants for nothing, except for Arlo to outgrow his fears and realize his courage, and for Arlo to better protect the grain stores from some roving bandit who turns out to be a feral human boy. When Arlo has the chance to squash the boy he finds that he doesnt have the heart to do it (I remember my grandfather trying to have me chop off a chickens headI don't remember if I had the heart to do it so I can sympathize) and he lets the boy go free. Upset by this Arlos father takes him on a journey to capture the grain guzzler and a put an end to the thieving but disaster strikes and Arlos dad barely saves him from a flash flood that sweeps dad away. Now alone and lost, and afraid, Arlo must develop the courage to find his way back home (if he can) and possibly squash that little human boy whom Arlo now blames for his dads death.

The set-up to this adventure is important and it can resonate with viewers on several levels: kids and people who are afraid and want overcome their fears but havent; people who have been afraid and have overcome their fears can also learn that they don't have to let their history withhold them from loving others as Arlo eventually learns to do with Spot (the feral boy who is more like Arlo than Arlo realizes); people who have lost loved ones can find that though the loved one can never be replaced a person can still stand up in their place and honor memory and family. The adventure that Arlo goes on is secondary to the conclusions that come from it and it will warm an open heart. If The Good Dinosaur has a significant flaw it would be in its pacingfine for an adult but a little slow for the kid set. On the flip side adults may want a more realistic, less cartoony visual style but kids will likely be drawn to the bright, open, and non-threatening visuals. This movie isn't trying to look really real, but it is brightly colored and often gorgeously detailed thanks to the folks at Pixar.",1487203200,,2618,4.278225806451613

7477049,1,B016P01W4G,"This movie is awful.  It attempts to establish familial ties and connections with its audience fall face first leaving you feeling empty and hollow throughout the movie.  The main character is a coward in the extreme, which on it's own isn't a bad thing, but the movie takes this character flaw and pushes it to the nth degree making it difficult and laughable to identify and sympathize with him.  Oh sure he ""overcomes"" it at the end, but what else would you expect, I was hoping he'd show more character development before the last 10 minutes of the movie so I could get on with my life.  The other characters are empty and hollow leaving the main character's emotions regarding them feel forced and contrived.  From the elder brother who is of course domineering and a jerk(not that he had enough screen time to show this particular trait more than once), to the sister & his mother who have maybe 90 seconds of screen time between the two of them.  Even the father who [spoiler alert] dies didn't leave me with anything but a bitter taste in my mouth, wishing that the main character was anyone but the main character.

Even worse is that throughout the main characters journey (which is roughly 80% of the movie) he's joined by ""Spot"" his fast human friend that of course acts like a dog and which the main character blames for his fathers death.  I've always wondered at this particular contrived plot device and how it makes cat people feel.  Do they feel left out of this movie?  Being a dog person, I don't know but even so, given Spot's ""characterization"" it's still very difficult to care.  Being taken away from his family Arlo(or whatever his name is I forgot to care) doesn't do anything except to provide a back drop for gorgeous scenery that Pixar is so fond of.  Beyond that, and the sad one-sided relationship formed between Spot and Arlo nothing happens.  No character development, just empty fluff and pretty pictures.

What's worse is the ""old west"" metaphor that this movie tries to use as its backdrop.  From the ""Red neck"" agrarian main character and his family, to the ""T-rex"" cowboys and ""cattle rustlers"";  I'm sure that pixar thought they were being clever in their attempt to make the movie more thematic, or at least tie everything together with a common theme.  Instead, it just ends up seemingly falling flat on it's face as the main character reacts like the coward he is to everything, never changing until forced to at the very end.  Every beat is as predictable as a clock ticking the seconds down towards the inevitable end, which can't come quickly enough.  Even the tried and true pixar ""murdering a parent"" trope is present.  Which still left me wishing the rest of his family would simply die bringing the end of this movie just that much closer.

If you want to watch a good Pixar movie skip this one.  Watch UP!, or the Toy Story flicks.  I'm just incredibly glad I didn't have to spend money on this movie, if I had it would have been one of two movies I've ever walked out of.  My standards aren't high, but Pixar, you can do better than this.",1486857600,2,3089,4.584699453551913

7477179,4,B016P01W4G,"What if humans were the ones to barely survive the meteor crash? And dinosaurs were the ones who survived and evolved? Ridiculous concept? Perhaps. But this movie dealt with the idea quite cleverly in an imaginative rehashing of the ugly duckling except this time, not only does the ""duckling"" turn into a mature, responsible and even brave dinosaur, (predictably of course) but he also befriends a lost, ""wilding"" (little human) in the process. Their time together while trying to get back home is an endearing adventure, and of course, life lessons are taught, and learned, along the way. I'd give this a movie a 5, but it doesn't quite have the bones to achieve that rating. No matter. It is still something I would sit down and watch again with my 9 year old...and my 19 year old. :-)",1484179200,2,788,4.676258992805756

My daughter is now old enough to enjoy this movie and the first time we played it, the DVD skipped. To the point where it was unwatchable. I reviewed the disc and noticed it was covered in scratches as if it were used. Since I bought the blue ray version, a regular DVD copy should have been included except it wasn't. The other disc was the ""dinosaur"" another movie by Disney but it was made in the mid 90s! Not even the right animated cartoon. So bizarre and very upset.

7477195,1,B016P01W4G,"Watched this movie with the wife and kids last night. It may be the single worst movie Ill see this year. If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother, I can summarize it for you. Imagine if the Young Earth Creationists who brought us the Creation Museum kidnapped John Lasseter in Strawberry Shortcake costumes and forced him, at gunpoint, to have Pixar make a movie written by some hack from Petersberg, Kentucky, who hasn't had a paying gig since the director of The Care Bears Movie (1985) fired him for incompetence. There are movies that you consume like a guilty pleasure: like candy or junk-food. You know they're garbage but you like them regardless. This is NOT one of those movies. It's the kind of movie that leads you to do crazy things that worry the neighbors: like run out your front door barefoot shaking your first at the sky and screaming: I WANT THAT TIME BACK! Please, LORD, give me that hour and forty-one minutes back! Erase my memory! Something! Anything! Make it go away, LORD; please, make it go away! It burns.",1484006400,2,1033,4.619565217391305

Set in unforgiving country Arlo, a runt of the litter child, helps his family with a homestead.
Not knowing the big adventure ahead of him in this coming of age story featuring all manner of Dinosaurs and even a human or two.

7477217,5,B016P01W4G,"This is a heartwarming, and touching story unlike anything that's been done before.  The characters are lovable, and relatable for all ages, and the situations make you really stop and think.  I think Arlo reminds all of us that it's okay to be afraid sometimes, that you can't judge others because you never know how much you may have in common, and that, despite tragedies, you can find love in the strangest places....and even when you do, sometimes there is sadness in a happy ending....and that's all okay.  I think everyone should sit down and watch this movie at least once.  Disney takes an interesting twist on the setting and runs with it, creating some wonderful characters that you are all sure to love while weaving a tale of ups and downs, of trials and tribulations, losses and gains, and laughter and tears.",1483660800,,823,4.734265734265734

Maybe I was just in a bad mood or maybe I was just having trouble relating to the animation which was on the low end of the scale. Maybe I just had trouble suspending disbelief long enough to get into the story. Either way, I just had a problem with the idea of dinosaurs farming without hands. I mean how did they plant the seeds? Build those buildings? It just went downhill from there.

7477271,1,B016P01W4G,"This was the first Pixar movie I've ever been disappointed with. The story starts by rushing through poorly constructed tropes (a runt who can't live up to his family's expectations, who soon loses a parent) to get to the main story. But then the story that starts isn't worth rushing to get to. The characters don't have any individual personalites, but instead each represent a stereotype of farmers, bullies, ranchers, hermits, and religious zealots ( One cries, ""The storm provides!"" before eating a cute furry creature.) THe human ""critter"" is not portrayed in a unique way at all, but simply a dog in a human body.
From a parent's perspective, it's unsettling that in this kids cartoon the main character is told to kill a ""critter"" (a toddler un-evolved human), and he threatens to squeeze the life out of the same human. The human rips the head off a giant beetle with his mouth, and we see the beatle's insides. The religous zealot teradactyls say they're going to rescue a cute fuzzy animal with big eyes then eat him (his tail hangs out of the teradactyl's mouth while he eats him). A group of redneck cattle-rustler dinosaurs threaten to kill the main character, ""I'm gonna love ending you.""",1482278400,5,1203,4.788461538461538
7477272,2,B016P01W4G,"The animation was beautiful - I guess that's enough for Pixar.

The meteor misses and the dinosaurs are on an alternate earth.  Arlo, the main character, and his family are agriculturally savvy dinosaurs who run their own fenced-in farm.  Huh.

The movie takes the standard turn when young Arlo's dad drowns in front of him, as the two were trying to capture a human critter, who had been stealing corn from the family silo. Awesome, kids love it when a parent dies.

Arlo, lost and alone in the forest, befriends the human and names him Spot. Perfect!

Arlo and Spot become friends and together try to make it back to the farm. On the journey back, they encounter many preditors from the friendly pterodactyls...who aren't so friendly when they pull a small critter apart, and swollow it, to the family of T-rexes who had their cattle stolen by cattle rustlers. Cattle rustlers?!

7477361,5,B016P01W4G,I am a grown man and the last 20 minutes had me needing a Kleenex. Great movie! My almost two year old son also liked it allot! I highly recommend fans of Pixar or those with young kids pick up this film. You will not regret your choice.,1480809600,,237,3.9583333333333335

7477363,3,B016P01W4G,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. It starts off well, and has some moving moments, (the stick scene and the ending come to mind,) but there's a lot of dark humor that doesn't bode well, especially a scene with pterodactyls.

The animation is beautiful, and is probably the film's strongest point, but if you're watching this for children, they probably really don't care that much how realistic the trees and water looks. The characters are very cartoony, and I realize that this is a cartoon, but it's not the character development I'm used to in Pixar films.",1480723200,,566,4.775510204081633

7477372,3,B016P01W4G,"I hated this movie the first time I watched it mostly because it's incredibly stressful and very little GOOD happens in the movie.  The dinosaur's journey gets worse and worse and worse until the VERY end.  There is very little humor to counteract the stress.

It is emotional and hard to watch, for this mama.

That being said, it does have a good message, Arlo grows a lot and learns to be brave and that he is strong. It's funny and adorable and my kids absolutely love it. My 6 year old got upset when the dad died (because Disney loves to kill parents)  but by the 700th time they watched it, it didn't upset him. My 3 year old is completely obsessed with this movie, but he is a dinosaur lover.

It's a good movie and my 3 kids (6, 3, and 2) love it. I like it, it's cute and it has its adorable and funny moments, it's just hard to watch. But I'm an emotional person haha.",1478217600,2,946,4.064516129032258

Also the soundtrack is an actual score, not modern pop songs that will annoy you or will feel dated in 6 months. Finally, the setting (I believe inspired by British Columbia) is beautiful. The details of clouds, mountains, geysers etc is spot on. Also, the main character (Arlo) facial expressions were wonderful. My son, 2.5 yrs old, loves it and asks to see it more than any other movie (Nemo, Ratatouille, Zootopia, etc). I think in part because their isn't confusing dialogue or jokes that only adults get.

7477505,3,B016P01W4G,"This is not my favorite Pixar film, at all. Though I find the movie to be visually interesting, and the character design is beautiful, the plot is just a little bit mature for a movie intended for children. I know that this one is PG, and I watched it before watching it with my 4 year-old, but in the end I think it just misses it's best audience as a result of the more mature themes.

Without being too specific, you will have to discuss death, drugs, racism (?) and intolerance, and the afterlife with your kids for them to make sense of this movie. Don't get me wring, none of these themes are portrayed in a manner that I found really inappropriate for children (maybe not really young ones). But even a gentle telling of a story with these elements, coupled with the constant fear of being eaten alive, was just a little bit intense. There are many redeeming moments where you go ""awwww, how sweet,"" but virtually no funny parts. This is essentially a coming of age drama crossed with the odd couple.

I do want to comment on just a few of the criticisms I read here. I was initially very put off by the appearance of humans and dinosaurs together in a movie. This just never happened in the real world. however, the movie is set up on a world where the meteor that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs never hit the Earth. so they both evolved accordingly. I thought it was clever that the human is portrayed as a non-verbal, dog-like creature, and that the dinosaurs have more human traits and civilizations. It's a clever notion.",1477353600,,1541,4.460992907801418

This movie is meant for children but there is no reason for anyone not to enjoy this movie; the plot is simple and juvenile but in a good way. It starts with Arlo, a young dinosaur, being carried away from his home by a river, and along his frantically eventful journey home, he is saved by a human child, and they become best friends and go on their amazing journey home together.
 What makes this a fantastic movie is its simplicity. The viewer never gets lost or has to guess what just happened, and they never want to stop watching the movie. It doesnt waste any time either; it just rolls along with the story and never stops pulling the viewer in. Most viewers say that they could watch The Good Dinosaur over and over again, and that it even has a little suspense and put them on the edge of their seats.
 Anyone who watches this movie will fall in love with the beautiful and colorful animation, that Disney has put into it. The length of this movie adds to the quality of it, because it does not drag on or have scenes in it that waste the viewers time, and the fact that it is short means that it does not take very much time out of the viewers day to watch this masterpiece. Another great thing about this movie has to be that it is family friendly and fun for everyone, any age, to watch. The absolute best thing about this movie has to be the fact that it has a sad but happy ending, because all good movies need to play with your emotions.",1476403200,,1619,4.253246753246753

7477691,5,B016P01W4G,"This was my 2 year old Sons favorite movie. We have every channel cable offers, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and we purchase all of the popular kids movies on BluRay that he likes but, he watched this one so many times we started hiding it and coaching him to watch other stuff because he watched it to the point it started to seem like an unhealthy amount of times. Bang for the buck though, he loved it and could watch it all day everyday if given the opportunity. (A few times when he was sick we let him just watch it as much as he wanted, and he has watched it 6 times in a single day on several occasions.) It is a good movie but I could recite every line start to finish in time sequence without the movie playing. Get this one if your kid loves dinosaurs.",1474761600,,763,4.12751677852349
7477692,1,B016P01W4G,"This had the potential to be a really lovely movie and instead there are highly violent, moderately terrifying scenes and language that just didn't need to be in it, in addition to mature language, and a random hallucination scene that goes entirely over the head of a 7 year old, but was it even necessary? There's another scene with a mentally ""disturbed"" dinosaur and it's coming up with names for the yet unnamed Spot - among other bizzaro names it suggests Murderer, Killer and other just plain weird and again unnecessary words and disturbing scene and characters.
The pterodactyl gang is viciously twisted.
The trailer didn't depict anything like this and we ended up skipping significant chunks of the movie - at other times I was just stupefied that this movie was even made for children. Why? Do yourself and your children a favor and watch something like Song of the Sea or My Neighbor Totoro, better yet read them a book, and spare them this film.",1474761600,,959,4.748502994011976

7477756,5,B016P01W4G,"With over 3600 other reviews, what can I add?  Perhaps a comment that it's good to see Pixar getting back to the basics of good storytelling, and not trying to make some kind of lame social commentary (e.g.: ""Cars 2"", aka, ""Big Oil is Evil""; ""Brave"", aka, ""Feminism Prevails Over Logic""; and ""Wall-E"", aka ""Wal-Mart is Evil"").  ""Good Dinosaur"" sticks to the tried-and-true formula of ""Bambi"", ""Pinocchio"" and ""Dumbo"" - i.e., life has sorrows, but the quality of the individual, as assisted by others, can overcome sorrows, and can help the individual to realize his/her full potential in light of adversity.  It's all about giving it your best, and realizing that your best is most fully realized when assisted by others.
The quality of the story-telling here is equaled only by the quality of the animation.  Both are of the highest quality.
Thank you, Pixar, for getting back to basics, with an original storyline that hews to the classics, along with their fundamental morals.  Children don't need to be preached to regarding the evils of Exxon and Wal-Mart - they need to be taught the fundamentals of developing personal moral character.",1474156800,,1142,4.958115183246074

7477759,3,B016P01W4G,"Strongly suggest parents preview before watching with younger kids. This movie is a tear jerker, make no mistake. I prefer my animation light hearted. I was fooled by the funny trailer that made my 2.5 y/o laugh and the Disney/Pixar name so I didn't preview it. Well, DOH! The kid was pretty traumatized by this especially when the protagonist talks to a vision of his dead father who is killed off early. And the pterodactyl circling scene while very well done and creepily suspenseful to me was terrifying to the little one. This is a kid that LOVES Disney's ""Dinosaur"" movie (2000). Also has a completely unnecessary scene of hallucinogen use by the ""kid"" and the protagonist. Its modern day animation; you can make anything magical without requiring shrooms. Tsk tsk.

7477789,4,B016P01W4G,"This movie is generally fantastic. The first scene with the meteor is wonderful. The characters are lovable and funny. The development of the good dinosaur is a good moral.

I knocked a star off because there are two really long, really intense scenes with the pterodactyl-like villains. The scenes terrify my two year old and really add very little to the story line; they are too over the top and really take away from the movie.

We have watched this movie again and again, always with the remote control ready to skip the pterodactyls.",1473638400,,539,4.723404255319149

There was also some "" dinosaurs that were violent"" so little toddlers could have been frightened. There is an ultimate happy ending, so, hopefully, there won't be any bad dreams as a result for the youngest. The older children  , age 8+, liked the video a lot. Disney videos are great, in general.

My 6-year old granddaughter and I liked this movie. In a generic environment, it showed how young ones, with parental guidance, can overcome insecurities and fears in new adventures and new encounters. It emphasized the importance of family while accepting diversity, This movie also introduced ""loss of a loved one"" in sadness but gladness with those family members who remained. I appreciated the lessons of life that children often encounter at a young age. Great adventure, sometimes treacherous, but still alive and loved.",1472774400,,560,5.363636363636363

7477908,3,B016P01W4G,"Honestly, this is a miss for me where Disney/Pixar is concerned.  The movie is slow and doesn't keep my attention as an adult.  My oldest child likes it because he is in his dinosaur phase, but my two youngest don't care for it.  I can't say I blame them.  I gave it three stars because my oldest likes it so much, but can't give it more than that.",1472601600,,348,4.073529411764706

7477914,5,B016P01W4G,"This was a really great movie for adults and kids alike and it is definitely another Disney-Pixar win.  It was an interesting twist to have the boy as the ""stray dog"" and the dinosaur as your main, humanized character.  The movie was also visually stunning and I enjoyed that the landscape played such a pivotal part in the story line.  As always there is a good tear or two shed during the viewing for the parents, and lessons to be learned.",1472515200,,442,4.432098765432099

7477922,1,B016P01W4G,"Don't let 4.5 stars this movie has fool you, it was horrible. The human was a dog essentially, all the sociopathic characters they meet on their journey, the acid trip after eating bad berries. Completely inappropriate for children and boring for adults. I wanted to like this so bad because my toddler loves dinosaurs. I watch it when it first came out and hated it, but when so many others talked about how they loved it, I gave it another chance... And hated even more the second time! I'm truly disappointed because I really wanted a good dinosaur animated film for my daughter and you would expect Disney Pixar to be the best.",1472256000,,631,4.592920353982301

7477936,2,B016P01W4G,"It's a hokey B movie. My kids love dinosaurs, we were excited to see this one. The landscapes are amazing, that's the only thing I can say that is good about it. It hurts my head why they chose to use such beautiful realistic scenery, and then make the dinosaurs cartoon-ish, and not even good cartoons. The story line is flat, and parts of it are downright disturbing/weird/bizarre. ""Spot"" is the only character that was enjoyable to watch. Regret buying it instead of renting first. The kids could care less about watching it again. Tried watching it again with a friend who enjoys kids movies for fresh perspective, they thought it was dumb too.",1471824000,,648,4.692982456140351

7477945,1,B016P01W4G,"It is a boringly, violent, western, with humans as dogs.  It also included an unnecessary and inappropriate hallucinatory drug scene.  The violence and slow pace mean it is not for kids, and yet the dinosaurish attempt at humor makes the adult aimed western theme seem out of place.  Ive seen much better westerns.  As a western, this adds nothing new, excepting faux dinosaurs.  It is also a coming of age story, but the repeated violence is too strong for those needing that message.  I don't think the mashup worked.  There were next to no laughs.  The chief emotions of the hero are: fright, sadness, and anger, nearly ALL movie long.  This was the worst Pixar movie I can think of.",1471651200,,686,4.65

It reminded me of the Lion King and of Land Before Time.  It really is a great movie.  My son has watched it 50 um-teen times since our trip last week and honestly I just can't say no.  It talks about confidence, fear, motivation, losing a loved one, but most of all about family.  It truly is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.",1471564800,,512,4.111111111111111

7478071,5,B016P01W4G,"I have to say this movie is......

AMAZING!.. Tears and all, sadness and happiness, I cannot start to explain how well written the story is. Great for kids and parents, the only thing I regret is not seeing it sooner.

I have never wrote a review for a movie before now, and I have written this because I am reading bad reviews/ratings. People keep comparing it to other pixar films,  yes it is different in the way characters were drawn, but it makes it UNIQUE.
I watched 'the good dinosaur' Today on Xfinity, not knowing what to expect as I had not looked at any reviews and I had only watched a 30 second trailer...
So, before it started I was slightly sceptical, thinking that it was going to be very kiddish! Then the film started.. through most of the film, my daughters and I were in tears! (My husband looked sooo into the movie too very focused on the story) It is the most heartwarming, emotional, animated film I have watched and it really touched my heart, some of the scenes in the film were so brilliantly thought out to show real messages! There was one scene where I was in floods of tears, the scene dealt with a serious theme, but did it so brilliantly! (you'll know what I mean if you watch it!) At the end our eyes were still watering! (Of a good warm feeling)

All I am saying is do not listen to the bad reviews. Most of them will be expecting something complex but, this film is really not about that! This film is inspiring! Especially for children! It is a simple film, but the subtle messages, such as overcoming your fears, the importance of family, and making your mark were heartwarming, and make you think, a lot!
And for those reviews that said the film scared their child? Well, I mine did cry at 2 important points, first of sadness and throughout the film they were asking questions, laughing, and full of excitement! And the second was by the ending but of happiness.  This film was very funny, but emotional at the right times, with a great plot that really makes you think! I loved this film a lot more than other Pixar films such as wall-E, Up or Toy Story. Yes, I know that these films have imaginative, classic plots, but this film teaches you a lot more than they do, and also makes you feel for the characters! So go ahead and watch! But don't listen to the bad reviews! You will be wanting to write against the bad reviews as well. ",1470355200,,2375,4.374149659863946
7478072,1,B016P01W4G,I wanted to like this movie. I don't... which is a bummer because I bought it instead of renting it. Watched it once and that was enough for me.,1470355200,2,144,4.0

7478075,3,B016P01W4G,"""The Good Dinosaur"" imagines that the dinosaurs never died out, but evolved into dinosaurs that could not only talk, but also grow crops and raise animals. Humans have never evolved past an animalistic state. One dinosaur has a pest problem with a human boy who keeps eating the family farm's food stores. When the young dinosaur tries to get rid of the human child, he gets swept away in a river, and has to find his way back home. Along the way, he and the young boy go from enemies to friends.

The premise is kind of out there to me. I mean, the idea of dinosaurs building tools, raising grain, and herding cows without  hands is a stretch. But it's a kid's movie, and this is a unique look at dinosaurs. The problem is that the dinosaur aspect is really weak. This is really a Western, where the dinosaurs talk and act like human farmers, and the humans act like dogs. If you replaced the dinosaurs with people and the humans with dogs, almost nothing would change about the story.

Since it's a Pixar movie, it goes without saying that the animation is well-done. Voice work is good. The story is engaging, if not a little formulaic. Really, the only problem with this movie is a lack of imagination we've come to expect from a Pixar movie.",1470268800,5,1246,4.456140350877193

7478096,2,B016P01W4G,"Immediate thoughts after watching The Good Dinosaur:

In spite of the gorgeous scenery & strong message of biological and adoptive families being very important I cannot recommend the movie. Humans are literally dogs, the ""vultures"" are obviously styled to paint theists in a horrible light, and there's just straight up a lot of death & scariness for a PG movie.

Also worth noting, all of the dinosaurs look out of place in their world. Arlo & his family particularly look like they stepped out of a Wallace & Grommet set, instead of believeably living in the beautiful west.

Plus, I never figured out why The Good Dinosaur is good...Prehistoric Homeward Bound or The Dinosaur and The Boy or Arlo and Spot would've all made more sense as titles.

I've said for a long time, but I'll say it again: just because Disney/Pixar makes a movie doesn't make it good & just because a movie is animated does not mean its kid-friendly. Super disappointed; cannot recommend.",1470009600,,965,4.83030303030303

It was so sad in some parts  and some joyful in others. I will watch it againif I have the oportunity. I will recomend this product to all my family and friends. I told one of my children to watch it  and when asked a bout it he was pleased with his experience. Another satisfied customer !,1469923200,,455,4.033333333333333

Still, it's beautifully made and well worth watching. If you have a sensitive child, you might see some tears.",1469923200,,372,4.920634920634921

I haven't researched if there's anything negative like adult humor that children shouldn't be listening to or anything like that, but if there is anything like that my children haven't caught on to it. So, in my opinion, it's a great movie!  One exception, I'm never a fan of movies showing loss or death scenes or implied death to little children. I know it's life, but just too early for young eyes.",1469836800,,463,4.578313253012048
7478136,5,B016P01W4G,"GREAT movie for kids and parents! Lots of positive lessons to be learned.

It starts with the hypothetical scenario in which the infamous asteroid that extinguished the dinosaurs never actually hit the earth. As a result, dinosaurs have had the opportunity to evolve into an agricultural species much like humans did. The story centers on one family of dinosaurs who are struck by a very relatable tragedy, which the youngest of the family, Arlo, blames on the stray human child who kept getting into their stuff. When Arlo gets separated from his family, however, it is the human child who becomes his ally and his only friend.

Themes include courage and the willingness to face one's fears for the greater good; confidence and self-appreciation; the value of those who are different from us; love, integrity, and family.",1469836800,,823,5.0

while i was getting a popcorn ready in the kitchen my four year old suddenly started to scream and cry uncontrollably. I had no idea what happened when she asked me to turn the movie off. when she went to bed i watched the movie to learn what made her so upset: 15 minutes into the movie little dinosaur's father is tragically dying - scene so realistic with fear of death engraved in father's eye's right before he is swept by raging water...

as i paused the movie i wondered of motives and reasoning for this sort of ""entertainment""... few minutes later i picked the phone up and cancelled family trip to diasney in Florida",1469404800,4,758,4.525547445255475

7478240,4,B016P01W4G,"It's a good movie for kids, once your child has the attention span to understand what is going on.  Unlike a lot of throwaway animated kids' movies, this one is a little more coherent and not full of campy fart jokes and pop culture references.  While it is the usual ""believe in yourself!"" sort of story, the animation is quite striking.  The scenery alone may be worth the price of admission if you're into that sort of thing.

I wouldn't put it on the same level as some other Pixar work, but it's certainly worth a watch.",1469059200,,525,4.381443298969073

And forget about me! I am a big crier, and I was BAWLING!!!  Imagine the two of us! I was trying to make my baby feel better, and only made it worse because I was crying so hard, which was then quite funny, but we still couldn't stop crying! I hadn't heard much about the movie before it came out on DVD, and didn't really know what to expect.  we watched it once, and that is prpbably all we will purposely watch!",1468540800,2,586,4.086956521739131
7478352,3,B016P01W4G,"You know, I can't fault the delivery of the movie. I got it just how I wanted it. I bought the Blu-Ray and thought it also had a DVD inside - so when I took it to school to show it for after testing relaxation, I found that I didn't have a DVD. I give this 5 stars for the way that Amazon teamed up with Disney to deliver a copy through the cloud for the DVD version.

However, the movie was probably one of the worst movies I have seen by Pixar - ever. Plot: Take the Dinosaur and have them do ""human things"" and take the human and have him act like an animal... This made absolutely not sense to me. I'm a sucker for something that will bring on the tears: I cried when I thought Papa Crood (from the Croods) was going to get killed - and then cried (this time a mad cry) when I realized that he was going to get saved and the movie goated me into feel sorry for Papa Crood.... but this movie - just made me angry at how stupid it was....

Eh... Unless you really don't care what you're watching - skip this one.",1468454400,,1014,3.9414634146341463

Personally, not a fan at all;  Disney in true Disney fashion having a parent being killed off on screen (or absent parent); albeit less traditionally a father this time is still disturbing to me.  ""Let me help you get over all of your fears son by dragging you out into a thunderstorm in the dark just for you to watch me die? Child guilt much? Plus hallucinogenic berries?

7478368,4,B016P01W4G,"Lets get the obvious out of the way right from the get-go:  With a track record as impeccable as Pixars its almost impossible not to hold them to a higher standard over the competition in the CG animated feature film game.  After all, they did invent it.

That said, its becoming increasing difficult to put a thumb on what or who Pixar is these days.  Since their absorption into Disney, the uniqueness that was once theirs and theirs alone is steadily fading.  This isn't to say they're no longer the absolute upper echelon of the industry of course, rather the reality is slowly sinking in that walking out of the theater of their films in absolute bewilderment as to how they keep coming up with these things is coming to an end.

The Good Dinosaur has also the misfortune of being released after Inside Out; a film which to many has shown the type of creativity and simplistic brilliance that put the company on the map in the first place.  Comparatively, The Good Dinosaur isn't nearly as progressive.  However, had it found itself positioned between fairly lackluster sequels Monsters University and Finding Dory, perhaps critical reception would have been a bit more forgiving.

The film has a bit of a turbulent history behind it as well.  Apparently it was born, as most Pixar projects are, upon a simple/ clever foundation.  Dating as far back as 2009, Ups Bob Peterson hatched the concept that what if that asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs and forever changed life on earth as we know it had missed?

Its rumored that by the end of summer 2013 Peterson was removed from the project, co-director Peter Sohn moved into the drivers seat, the story re-imagined, a new cast brought in and a whole new projection for release calculated (in other words, pushed back).

The end result is what we now know as The Good Dinosaur, Pixars 16th animated feature film, released November 2015.  Interestingly, it also represents the first time Pixar has ever released two films in the same year (the other of course being Inside Out).

The budget on this one is estimated at about $200-million and it took in $331.9-mil at the box office.  A monster profit for sure but a drop in the bucket when compared to the type of returns both Disney and Pixar have come to expect in their seemingly inescapable-hype marketing campaigned projects.  In fact, it bears the distinction of being Pixars lowest grossing film to date.

The story tells of Arlo, the youngest of a trio of apatosaurus hatchlings born (hatched) into life on the farm.  Cowardly, awkward and gangly, Arlo struggles to find his place within the family farm as well as within the world at large.

Due to a series of events, he finds himself far removed from the corner of the world his family calls home and ends up inadvertently befriending an orphaned human child named Spot along the way.

In a sort of role reversal from convention, the world Good Dinosaur gives us plays with the concept that not having gone extinct millions of years prior, dinos could have evolved into the dominant species on the planet; even during the rise of primitive man.  As a result, they talk, work jobs, play pranks on one another and have to plan for the winter without access to food (an especially pertinent concern for the herbivorous apatasaurs).  Though certainly food for thought, in execution the society is as much Flintstones as it is inverse Jurrasic Park.

The core of the film builds upon the bond possible between man and beast- or in this case, beast and man.  In a lot of ways its no different from what we witnessed in the vastly superior How to Train Your Dragon franchise from DreamWorks just told from the opposite perspective.

About my biggest complaint with the piece is the depth- as in the complete lack there of.  The above summary IS the story!  Arlo gets separated from his family and begins the arduous journey back home and discovers himself along the way.  Sure themes of believing in ones self, physical size not being as important as heart, looks of enemies being deceiving etc. all make their presence felt along the way, the reality is this is hardly novel storytelling for any medium.

The most heartfelt and natural moments of the film are the ones that work off the bond Arlo and Spot form (in an ironic twist where mankind is the animal to the civilized dinosaurs).  In fact one particular scene where the main character and Spot explain the concept of family and what happened to each of theirs respectively without the ability to speak to one another harkens back to some of Pixars more brilliant and touching sensibilities.

In the end, however, the lack of cleverness and straight forward nature of the plot are absolutely overshadowed by the possibilities of what if.  Imagine what kind of a story you might tell if given the premise the dinosaurs were never rendered extinct, human beings are annoying little vermin in their world and you have Disneys endless budget to make insure whatever you dream up can happen onscreen.  Would you tell the basic story that an insecure farm boy gets separated from his home and learns about friendship through a bond with a savage human boy?  Would that rival the type of cleverness that are the Toy Stories, the sense of irony that is Wall-E or the quiet dignity that defined a human lifespan found in Up?

Worse still is this is the revised version of the story, keep in mind.  If all of the delays were to improve upon the material, one really has to wonder what they had going on before.

The greatest achievement the film can boast however comes in its visuals.  They aren't just good, they are downright spectacular.  In high definition it is literally difficult to tell whether or not the backdrops and settings are photo-realistic (the character models, however, not so much).  While this film may not be convincing evidence Pixar has continued to push the envelope story-wise consistently, it is indisputable proof that they never lost their stronghold concerning visuals.  Like always, they set the bar and now the rest of the industry will have to play catch-up.

In conclusion, make no mistake, The Good Dinosaur is an enjoyable 93-minutes, filled with memorable characters, big action sequences and visuals that absolutely dazzle.  Kids will undoubtedly find the lack of complexity in plot and relatively small cast of characters easy to ingest.  Where things get a little ugly is when you stop to remember that this is the product of the highest echelon the genre has to offer and then stop to ponder the legacy on which it was built.",1468195200,,6576,4.75

The whole making your mark thing was sad.  Needing to ""kill the critter"" was too grown up.  The dad losing his temper and then getting swept away was awful.  The berry drug scene was in bad taste and scary too. Even the books made about the Good Dinosaur are altered to leave a lot of that out.  One doesn't even mention the dad dying and he just disappears from the story.  Hmmmm....really.  Obviously, they didn't want to write all that awfulness in a children's story.

The ultra realistic nature clashes so harshly with the goofy cartoon characters.  It is so poorly mixed that it looks like green screen animation in places.  The rest of world they build makes no sense.  Why are people dogs?  Why do people walk around on all their hands and feet when their bone structure is not evolved for that?  Was there not one evolutionary biologist on the research team?  Or someone familiar with agriculture?  How about any experts at all? God this movie is terrible.

7478604,3,B016P01W4G,"I have to acknowledge the brilliant animation use in this movie, especially the background stuff like water that just looks, not just really good but real.  I haven't seen better animation than that, if this wasn't nominated for whatever animation awards there are it should have been and it should have won!  But the movie story as a whole, I wasn't that impressed with.  I actually asked the question after about ten minutes or so ""do you want to keep watching this?"" as the beginning is nauseatingly bad, dinosaurs growing crops, clearing forests, and raising chickens (when they are herbivores and don't eat meat or eggs, why have chickens?) and with a completely unlikable title character.  The movie could have been called The Wussy Dinosaur or the Cowardly Dinosaur. But the answer, ""well we've paid for it, so we might as well see if it gets better, had us watching it all the way through.  It does get better than the beginning but  overall the storyline isn't great, and at times is a bit bizarre overall.  We've of course since Pixar was bought by Disney had to have the obligatory death of a parent scene.  It wasn't really necessary for the plot since the main character could have just fallen in the river anyway and been swept a few horizons worth of distance away.  How  you can be unconscious in a river for that distance and not drown was ridiculous.  Then the main character has many other near brushes with death or injuries that should have meant in a world without dinosaur hospitals, he'd be dead pretty quick.  But injuries soon are forgotten such as broken or at least badly sprained and swollen leg appearing normal not long after, until the next temporary injury of course.  Also for a dinosaur without hands, this one seems to be able to grab onto the edge of cliffs and stuff.

Humans are like rats at the start of the film, eating harvested crops in a grain silo, much to the dinosaur's survival over the upcoming winter peril, so need to be killed, then become like dogs, the dinosaur even names a young child who saves it a number of times Spot.  Spot walks on his arms like front legs, and scratches itches with his foot even though he's got hands.  Spot as a young child not only has survived by himself but can fall from great heights and not break bones or be injured in any way.  Humans communicate by howling and sniffing each other.  Besides farming other breeds of dinosaur do other human world things such as are cattle ranchers, or cattle rustlers.  Basically this is similar to picture books where human characters have just been drawn as dinosaurs and rats and then dogs have been substituted for humans. This same story could have been told with a cowardly human who chases a dog.

The basic plot is this wussy dinosaur needs to grow a set and travel home to his mother if he is to survive before Winter hits.  Even though the mother complained with the death of her husband that she won't be able to harvest enough crops before Winter arrives, so they would have a better chance of survival if they didn't have a useless mouth to feed.  Along the way the dinosaur will face death a number of times, get high on magic mushroom style berries and meet a homeless triceratops dinosaur with a mental illness who thinks animals living on it are protecting it and wants the human boy. Since the human boy sneaks onto the farm all the time you'd think he'd not only know the way but be able to get the dinosaur there in less than a day or whatever it takes him to regularly do so, but that's just one of the major plot holes in the movie.  Not to mention why did the father die if he just fell in the river, when the much smaller main character didn't, and could survive falling down waterfalls and things like this too? In a world where kids get a medal for just competing, the final scene catered to that which results in an ending where you're thinking, well what was the point of that then?",1466294400,,3932,4.49929676511955

7478634,5,B016P01W4G,"Very charming family-oriented movie with great animation!  When I say family-oriented, I don't mean that it's just safe for kids to watch, but that at its heart is a theme of what it means to be a member of a family. The premise of the movie is that the extinction of dinosaurs didn't happen 65 million years ago, (the asteroid misses the earth), and we have an alternate reality where dinosaurs (Arlo's family, the T-Rex family he later meets) have advanced to the point of being able to talk and run farms (for the plant-eaters) and cattle ranches (the T-Rex's). Humans are not the dominant species, as pack animals similar to wolves, they live in families (the theme, again), are intelligent hunter-gatherers,  and haven't developed speech yet.

If you don't get caught up in the paleobiology and such realities that Apatosaurs were extinct millions of years before T-Rex was around, and other logical flaws (remember, it's just a movie), it's very enjoyable and fun. In homage to earlier Disney flicks, they retained the stylistic form of the mid-century Disney dinosaurs (think of Dino in the Flintstones rather than the realism of the raptors in Jurrasic Park movies).

The writing is well done, with verbal humor that is surprisingly subtle for a kid's movie. I enjoyed scene after scene of just the dialogue. The human critter, Spot, has no dialogue, but his facial and body language are superbly done.

The bonus features are very interesting, and one part explains the fallacies in the movie, setting the record straight, as well as detailing the people involved in making the movie, and how the movie developed from their experiences on their research working with a real family who runs a ranch.

Though the dinosaurs are stylized and somewhat cartoonish, the animation of the environment is jaw-droppingly realistic. It's clearly based on Yellowstone or the Grand Tetons parks, trees' leaves and needles sway in the winds, the moving clouds throw shadows on the hillsides, the coloration of the river pebbles and the dinosaurs' skin textures are hyper-realistic, the water in the rivers and ponds realistically move and scatter the light. In some scenes, as the ""camera"" pans around, there are computer-generated artifacts of internal reflections of the sunlight on the camera ""lenses"" that just subtly pop in and out to make you think that a real camera was being used, when you know it wasn't, which shows how painstakingly the artists worked on this! It's a very clever trick that subconsciously works well.

If you have kids, then get this and watch it with them, you may find that you enjoy it more than they!",1465948800,4,2627,4.9433106575963714

7478664,3,B016P01W4G,"At its core, this movie is a ""Coming Of Age"" ""Boy and His Dog"" plot, with a dinosaur playing the part of boy and a human playing the part of dog. Its a fine story, and very good if that is what you are looking for.

But it completely underutilized the most common question from the trailers ""What if the Dinosaurs didn't go extinct?"" And I was disappointed by that. You can essentially replace every dinosaur with a human, and the humans with actual dogs, and you could practically have the same movie scene for scene.

I will say that the CGI landscape is phenomenal, easily the best and some of the most beautiful CGI I have ever seen. I almost wonder if this movie was rushed to theaters just so Pixar could show off their new technology.",1465689600,,741,4.36231884057971

The animation was superb but the story was hardly a story, the soundtrack was nothing special, and the character development was pretty limited.  It should have been a Pixar short film.  It almost doesn't need dialogue, it's so simple.  It bothered me that the scenery looked so realistic while the characters looked fake - kind of like they were standing in front of a blue screen or a backdrop.  If they wanted to invest that much in designing the setting, maybe they could have come up with a more sophisticated plot, or just wowed us for a few minutes in a short film.",1465603200,2,673,4.439024390243903

We don't even have kids, but my husband and I love kids movies. I love watching something entertaining and light for a relaxing evening at home. From the trailer it looks like a cute movie about a boy and a dinosaur. THIS IS NOT THAT MOVIE. It involves repeated death, frequent natural disasters, scary predators....yeah I was basically stressed out watching the whole thing. I'm 34 years old. I can't imagine showing this to a child! I work in law enforcement and by no means an I squeamish. I deal with terrible stuff often. But when I select a movie about a goofy looking green dinosaur, I am expecting more Pete's Dragon and less Lord of the Flies.

My 2 and 5 year old boys liked it ok, but kids are hardly the best judges of what is appropriate for themselves. Maybe society has grown numb to violence, or maybe we just think animated violence is acceptable, but I found this movie to be way too disturbing for little kids. If the characters had been live action, the movie would have been pg-13. Moreover, none of the characters were likable.

They love killing off one or both the parents, or having them be separated. Is it against the Disney/Pixar ""religion"" for any of their characters to come from a functioning 2 parent household? We have our conflicts too, ya know...it isn't all white picket fences and pearl necklaces.... And somebody at one of these companies has major dad issues that keep coming out in the movies...

7478769,1,B016P01W4G,"Talk about a totally and completely weird and inappropriate movie for kids. Or adults just because it's so stupid. Where do we start? The part where the human is actually a dog in mind and spirit? The part where the child is rejected outright by his assumed, human behaving parents? The part where the dinosaur is filled with bloodlust for and actively seeks to kill the kid after dad dies while hunting down the kid (sh dino blames the kid) which is what takes them on their ""cute"" little romp together? The director and gang must've been heavily heavily dosed up for this one. Including the scene where the kid and the idiot dinosaur get stoned together. Yes, they get stoned together and go on a classic acid trip. Awwwwwwwwww. How darling is that? It's not. I'm from the acid dropping generation.

7478778,5,B016P01W4G,"What an adorable and perfect twist on the old tale of a dog and his boy! Pixar has always been known for its tear-jerking, laugh till you pee, family fun cartoonery, and the Good Dinosaur is another in a long line of great movies.

Spot, the little human boy, is so perfectly puppy-like and yet fully human in a very real sense. He's relateable and likeable on a primitive level (no pun intended) that every user identifies with.

Arlo, the dinosaur, is the youngest son in a loving family of five and portrays the awkward adolescent. He tries desperately to defeat his fears of chickens and his clumsiness at chores so that someday he can be worthy of placing his mark on the world.

Pixar did such a wonderful job of working together this story of growth and adventure. They manage to simultaneously break your heart with a moment of tragedy and then sew it carefully back together again through the rest of the hour's intricate web of this unlikely duo's bonding together not as pet and owner, but as friends.

tldr: cried, laughed, aww'ed, cried more, regained faith in humanity (and dinosaur-ity??).",1464825600,7,1104,4.704663212435233

Fortunate for me I can prepare my kids for the inevitable and they're not traumatized by as I was waay back when Bambi's mother was killed.  I thought there was a small chance dealing with a life changing event xsuch as the lost of a parent in a cartoon movie could have possibly been avoided considering Pixar was part of the production.

Bad preditors are those that eat animals. Tyrannosaurus Rex are good because they eat cow type animals that they cultivate. They also tell stories about ripping up other animals and are "" Texans.""

And I didn't feel like it was suitable for younger children. The whole movie was very intense with the main character always in grave peril and rarely feeling safe and secure at all. That was distressing even to me, as an adult. There is some element of a moral lesson in terms of communicating with and befriending someone who speaks a different language and behaves differently from you, and learning to be selfless in matters of others' best interest, but overall probably one of the only Disney movies Ive ever seen that I didn't really like once the final credits rolled.",1464652800,2,743,4.8125

We have 7 children ages 18-1.5 years and not a single one of us liked this movie even a little!  We all kept waiting for it to get better.  It doesn't.

I very seldom watch animated movies  but my daughter and  7 yr old grandson loved it so I sat down to make them happy. I was captured from the very beginning. Seems there have been a lot of negative reviews and the movie is very underrated. The editorial review reads :From the innovative minds of Disney-Pixar comes a hilariously heartwarming adventure about the power of confronting and overcoming your fears and discovering who you are meant to be. THE GOOD DINOSAUR asks the question: what if the asteroid that forever changed life on Earth missed the planet completely, and giant dinosaurs never became extinct? In this epic journey into the world of dinosaurs, an apatosaurus named Arlo makes an unlikely human friend.

Yes, it's somewhat of a recycled story, and while it's not as punchy as other Pixar hits like Toy Story or The Incredibles, I can tell you there are many silly moments you'll giggle at...and many that will have you shedding tears.

7479007,3,B016P01W4G,"The only real problem with this Pixar animated film is that it follows films that have set the bar very high.  That, and it also follows a theme weve seen before.  The story centers on a family of green dinosaurs (brontosaurus-like).  Like the rest of the wildlife, they speak English.  One of the triplets is named Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) who is very sensitive and wellcowardly.  Hes the last to make his mark but his dad (Jeffrey Wright) has confidence that he will eventually get over his fright complex.

Arlo is placed in charge of finding and killing the creature who is raiding their grain elevator.  Yes, they can build and farm.  Instead he finds out that the culprit is a humanoid boy called Spot (Jack Bright).  As his name suggests Spot acts more like a canine than an ape and in a juxtaposition, doesnt talk, just howls.  Arlo and Spot become friends and through a storm and flood get separated from Arlos family.  They are now on their own, constantly hounded by a trio of pterodactyls.  They find safety amongst 3 T-Rexs!  These scenes are my favorite and probably the key to the moral compass of the film.  Sam Elliot is the daddy T-Rex, who imparts wisdom that will carry Arlo back home.

This is a good film that looks and sounds terrific just like the rest of the Pixar films.  It just doesnt quite reach the standard of the best.",1462752000,,1346,4.522821576763485

7479009,3,B016P01W4G,"This is a review of the film alone, not the video release.  I'll start by saying that Pixar has yet to make a flat out BAD movie.  Some have not been to the level of excellence we've come to expect, but none have been flat out bad movies.  The Good Dinosaur is not a bad movie, but it's not to that level of excellent storytelling, at least, I expect from the brand.  The premise of the film is that the meteor that took out the dinosaurs actually missed and therefore a few million years later, Dinosaurs are still the top life forms on earth.  The story follows Arlo, a young farm-boy dinosaur, and runt of the family as he is accidentally swept away from his home and family and must find his way back.  He is befriended by a young human (sort of a wild-feral-boy) he names Spot.  They have to get past predators and nature to find the way back home.  At one point they meet up with a father T-Rex and his son and daughter who are cattle farmers and help rescue the heard of longhorns from rustlers.  I bring this up because it's probably the sequence I enjoyed the most and I got the feeling that the whole movie was plotted out like a western.  ""The young farm boy and his ""dog"" must survive the wild west in order to find their way back to the homestead.""  The movie is even scored like a western.  Lots of fiddle, mandolin, guitar, and piano are featured.  I kind of dug the soundtrack.  One problem with the ""western"" choice was that, even though we are seeing dinosaurs in stead of people, I felt like I'd seen it all before.  As for young viewers who have not grown up having seen hundreds of westerns yet, this all may seem fresh and interesting to them, but for me it got a little tiresome.  There is a Bambi/Lion King/Land Before Time type plot point that could be challenging to younger viewers and some imagery and a hallucination scene that will be totally lost on the youngsters.  I also found the use of hyper-realistic environments mixed with the sort of cartoony styled characters never seemed to mesh for me and helped to keep me from being drawn into the film.  I'm probably being a little hard on a kids movie from Pixar, but I have come to expect more from them.",1462665600,,2186,4.329238329238329
