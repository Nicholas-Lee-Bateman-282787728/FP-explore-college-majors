8036358,4,B00061H84Y,"This Cartoon Craze DVD has 5 ""Gabby"" cartoons from the early '40s, created by the Fleischer Studios, directed by Dave Fleischer, with music by Sammy Timberg; Gabby's voice was done by Pinto Colvig. Gabby sings ""All's Well"" and has appointed himself ""a committee of one"" to make the community ""a better place."" In other words, he's an annoying busybody who loves to give unwanted advice and put his nose where it does not belong. He makes a mess of everything, and some of the situations are quite funny, but a little of Gabby goes a long way. The final 4 episodes are little known oddities from 1935, made by the Van Beuren Studios, and not much information is known about them.  I would say this collection is for animation aficionados only, and probably the ""Parrotville"" episodes are artistically the most interesting. Total running time is 63 minutes.

Episode list:
1: ""All's Well,"" 1941. Animated by Dave Tendlar and William Nolan. Gabby tries to put a diaper on a yelling baby, and gets the run-around.
2: ""Fire Cheese,"" 1941. Animated by Steve Muffatti and Joe Oriolo. Gabby thinks he knows how to put out a house fire. The fire has another idea, as the flames have faces and dance around.
3: ""Gabby Goes Fishing,"" 1941. Animated by Orestes Calpini, Otto Feuer, and Al Eugster. Gabby tries to teach a little boy how to fish, and the fish teach Gabby a lesson. This copy of the episode shows its age and the color is washed out.
4: ""It's a Hap Hap Happy Day,"" 1941. Animated by Orestes Calpini and Irving Spector. The Mayor wants to go camping alone, but Gabby invites himself, with dire results. This was the last ""Gabby"" cartoon.
5: ""King for a Day,"" 1940. Animated by Willard Bowsky and James Davis. Gabby delivers a letter to Little King, with more dire consequences! I have seen much better copies of this episode, as the color on this one is washed out.

6: ""Parrotville Post Office,"" 1935. Animated by Burt Gillett and Tom Palmer. There were 3 Parrotville cartoons made, and this one is the 3rd. It's colorful, and about 2 rambunctious parrot kids who make a mess of the post office, but in the end are heroes by capturing the infamous Black Parrot bandit.
7: ""Parrotville Old Folks,"" 1935. Animated by Burt Gillett and Tom Palmer. Party time at Grandpa's, with some clever animation in this one. These 2 Parottvile episodes are in great shape for their age, and this one is the 2nd in the series of 3.
8: ""Scotty Finds a Home,"" 1935. Animated by Burt Gillett. A kitten wants Scotty the dog to be a part of the family, but mama cat says ""no,"" until Scotty becomes the hero of the day.
9: ""Spinning Mice,"" 1935. Animated by Burt Gillett and Tom Palmer. This one is an oddity, with part live action, as a little boy puts live mice into a dollhouse, and one of the mice becomes a cartoon that speaks to the boy and his sister. I have to wonder what became of this boy, who is so unique, and looks like a mini Red Skelton.",1124582400,6,2932,4.517890772128061
