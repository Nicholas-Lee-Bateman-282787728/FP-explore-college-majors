Ann Stafford, as the mother, stole the movie.  Her performance rocked in ""Keep My Grave Open""",1314921600,2,271,4.723404255319149
8060314,2,B0009GUG8Q,"Go Into The Bayou And You May Never Come Out! -
A sorta Sequel to the Infamous Poor White Trash aka Scum of the Earth from Infamous Schlock Horror Producer S.F. Brownrigg - This rare horror big box video from the ole days of mom n' pop video stores was released by Magnum Entertainment. Definite scrapping the barrel to come up with this low-budget indie horror flick.

They thought a quiet back roads jaunt through the Louisiana bayou  country would be the perfect romantic getaway - but this young couple didn't count on meeting up with the unutterable brutality of Poor White Trash. Their first night in a swamp side cabin is shattered when the girl discovers that their car has been sabotaged. Worse, her boyfriend's head has been lopped off by some unseen maniac! With no phone, no car and no hope she's forced to flee into a deadly wilderness. There she encounters a sadistic bunch of hillbillies with some very peculiar ideas about souther hospitality.",1210204800,,959,4.736526946107785
8060315,2,B0009GUG8Q,"Where do I start? The movie was made in the 70's, and really didn't have any real atmosphere except a backwoods bayou feel that maybe Deliverance had (but not as good). The movie didn't even have much killing, from what I remember 3. None of them bloody.

The movie did hint rape and incest in some scenes, but overall the movie was really slow and boring.

One of the only reasons I bought this was because I collect obscure big box VHS movies. I really don't think I could watch this for a second time.",1180915200,2,504,4.294736842105263
