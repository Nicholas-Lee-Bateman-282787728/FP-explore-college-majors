505693,5,6302685141,"I will be 30 next year.  This was my favorite film when I was 15.  I remember I taped it off of TBS and must have watched it at least 50 times.  Watching this truly exceptional widescreen print brought back a lot of  memories.  I usually try to watch period movies in the context of their  era, but this film is timeless.  Do yourself a favor when watching this  film: try to focus not on the (coincidental) early deaths of its' stars but  instead on the powerful potrayals within.",923356800,2,481,4.314606741573034
505694,5,6302685141,"This will always remain one of my favorite films of all time.  After seeing it I can finally understand the reasons why James Dean has such a following.  He is what everyone either envisions himself as or wishes to  be.  In my mind, you can't quite label him an anti-hero in this movie.  You  have to show his character respect. In my mind, what makes this film great  is what you might find fault with in other films.  At times it seems overly  melodramatic and so emotional it seems painful to watch.  But this ain't no  ""Titanic.""  Somehow, all this intense emotion is what gives the  film its power.  When you are in high school everything seems as though it  is a life or death situation.  Who can honestly say that they weren't  utterly self-absorbed at that age and even in the present?  All the typical  themes are included such as unrequited love, fitting in, complex family  relations, and violence(today kids might have guns but name another scene  as riveting and dangerous as the switchblade fight). The additions to the  widescreen version are very worthwhile and offer some extra insight.  Is it  just me or does Natalie Wood seem on edge during her interview?  The Dean  ""safe driving"" interview is also rather interesting if not kind  of sick.",919296000,4,1260,4.660550458715596
505695,5,6302685141,"James Dean was one of a kind.  He was not the first to play a rebel nor a misunderstood youth but, he had a unique style all his own.  James Dean made three films where he had starring roles.  This is the one that made  him a rebel.  All three of his films including ""East of Eden"" and  ""Giant"" are must haves for fans.  James Dean died very young and  really before he got started as an actor but, his films and his image  live...",915753600,,431,3.976470588235294

505847,4,6302685141,"Released in 1955, Rebel without a Cause is a youth drama about a troubled teen, Jim Stark (James Dean), a new kid on the block in Los Angeles, where he meets other confused mid-50s youths, e.g. Judy (Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo). Corey Allen plays Jims rival, Buzz, while Jim Backus & Ann Doran appear as Jims parents. Dennis Hopper and Nick Adams are on hand as other juvenile delinquents.

In real life the three protagonists would all die prematurely: Dean one month before the film was released (24 years-old), Natalie in 1981 (43 years old) and Mineo in 1976 (37 years-old). While Dean was 24 during filming, both Natalie and Mineo were actually teenagers, 17 and 16 respectively. This was particularly amazing for the former, as she comes across seasoned, although obviously youthful.

The movies iconic and seminal, but other teen angst movies predated it, like Brandos The Wild One, which debuted 20 months before Rebel. Yet The Wild One is lame by comparison. While Brando is almost always great, Rebel is less eye-rolling than The Wild One and more dramatically engaging, not to mention psychologically interesting. A compelling knife fight pulls the viewer in early on, which culminates with the tragic chickie run sequence. Unfortunately, the movie is overly talky with too much filler; it couldve been tightened up by cutting like 20-25 minutes.

Writer/director Nicholas Ray interestingly never shows teachers or school faculty, which shows that they're negligible as influences for the confused youths. Notice how the astronomer at the Observatory drones on in a boring monotone. He bleakly insists that life on earth is meaningless in the grand scope of the universe, which ironically is meaningless to the teens, each of whom is the center of the universe, as far as they're concerned. Only their parents, peers and police hold sway in their worlds. The sole adult to really understand them is Officer Ray, clearly named after the writer/director.

One presumptuous critic argued that Plato (Mineo) was a homosexual on the grounds that he caresses Jims shoulder in the Observatory and later invites him to his house where theyd be alone, but Platos interest in Jim is obviously simply hero worship as Plato looks for a worthy father figure to pattern his life, which Jim literally becomes in the charade with Judy at the deserted mansion (notice how Plato has no problem with Judys presence). Basically, Plato is to Jim what Barney Rubble was to Fred Flintstone. The caress is merely a tap on the shoulder and the fact that it was misinterpreted by this critic informs you about his own dubious sexuality. Mineos later confessed bisexuality is irrelevant to the topic.

While Dean lacks the intense charisma of Brando, hes inimitable, enigmatic and somewhat interesting. His character, Jim, is surprisingly NOT one-dimensional. Too bad he died so young (breaking his neck in an auto accident).

The picture runs 111 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & the surrounding areas (Burbank Studios, Santa Monica High School & Calabasas). ADDITIONAL WRITERS: Stewart Stern & Irving Shulman. ADDITIONAL CAST: Marietta Canty appears as Platos loving black guardian while William Hopper & Rochelle Hudson are on hand as Judys parents.

James Dean died very young just after this movie was made.  Natalie Wood was a child star.  Although a modern viewer may find it somewhat stylistically dated, it is nonetheless an excellent, iconic drama.

This movie was from the 1950s when American Middle Class society was being portrayed as homogenized.  Conformance was the order of the day.  The movie ""The Blackboard Jungle"" was produced at about the same time.  These movies seem to at the vanguard of the social unrest of the 1960s.  This is a great movie.

Kids were riveted to this film relating to James Deans sufferering and desire to launch out as an adult breaking away from childhood and family problems. What's odd it the combination of youths it evolves into: Dean, Wood and Mineo. Three very different youths but bound together by their sharing two things: family problems and the deep, passionate desire to GET AWAY.

On one level I understood what I was watching, but on another level not too much about the characters or situations seemed too real to me.  And it was hard to buy into James Dean playing a teenager.

506071,2,6302685141,"La Fureur de Vivre / Rebel Without a Cause, 1955 film

The opening scene shows a man dressed in a suit and tie who lays on the ground to look at a toy monkey! [Symbolism?] Jim Stark is arrested for ""plain drunkenness"". Judy is at the police station, she was wandering around in the early morning (she has a problem with her father). [Jim has a problem in growing up.] John is brought in for shooting some puppies! [A sign of a bad future?] Jim's parents have conflicts, his striking the desk shows his troubled personality. Jim's inability to make friends suggests his peers recognize his troubled psyche. Jim quickly sobers up after his talk with the Juvenile Bureau officer. Jim's father offers good advice about picking friends.

The field trip at the Planetarium predicts the end of the world [symbolism for this movie?] Is this some type of conditioning to confuse students? Jim Stark meets a local gang and undergoes an initiation rite. Back home his dad wears an apron over his business suit! [Unbelievable?] Unlike other teenagers, Jim does not have a good appetite. Judy also has a problem with her home life. [Does the script show cartoon characters?] Then we see the strange game of ""chicken"" that sets a bad example for kids foolish enough to identify with these characters (who seem to have little parental supervision). One driver bails out, the other has an unintended consequence. Jim gets to drive Judy home. John tags along, like a lost puppy. John also drives a motor scooter, a symbol of an odd choice. At home Jim drinks milk out of a glass bottle [more symbolism?].

Back home Jim delights in scandalizing his parents with his confession of wrongdoing. His parents try to talk sense to him but Jim seems to be self-destructive. [No wonder he has trouble making friends, they sense his troubled psyche.] The script calls for Jim and Judy to go up the hill to an old deserted mansion (in the middle of Griffith Park?). John is attacked by Buzz's friends, they take an address book to find Jim. John figures out where they went. [There seems to be some symbolism in meeting in an empty and desolate house.] Their talk and laughter seems out of character for these teenagers. The fantasies of John show his psychological problems. Jim and Judy talk about what they want. [Can teenager really know what they want?] Buzz's three friends find where Jim is hiding. Now there is more trouble, and the police show up. Jim's parents show up for more drama and ironic comments. The teenagers flee to the Planetarium. Will the end of their world come soon? Jim seems to develop a new personality. The ending seems long and drawn out for no apparent reason, unless it is to lull the viewers for the surprise ending. [I found this to be quite amusing.] There was little news coverage of this police action that would not happen in real life.

After 50 years the only reason to watch this film is for historical reasons. What made this so popular in its day? Pandering to teenagers? It has a clunky script and story, like some drive-in movie of that time.",1456099200,,3061,4.662962962962963

506137,3,6302685141,"I find this movie to be highly overrated. If you want to see movies about teenagers who have unhappy home lives and as a result are angry and rebellious, I recommend you watch any of the first three movies made that were based on S.E. Hinton novels. Tex, The Outsiders, and Rumble Fish besides being based on classic novels and having all-star casts, are much more believable, and don't get corny like Rebel Without A Cause does.

Just based on the actors alone, what would you expect to be better: Jim Dean playing the rebel with Jim Backus playing his father, or In Rumble Fish Matt Dillon and Mickey Rourke playing the rebels with Dennis Hopper playing the alcoholic, incompetent father?

Also, Dean and Wood aren't very sympathetic because they come from comfortable neighborhoods and while there parents aren't the best, they're far from being the worst parents they could have had. Natalie Wood's character isn't very likable either because of how quickly she changes her affections from one boy to another.

SPOILER ALERT (STOP READING HERE UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE)

Before the race, Wood's character kisses Buzz and wishes him good luck. Not just a peck on the cheek but a romantic kiss. Then as soon as Buzz dies in the crash, she immediately absconds with James Dean's character.",1454889600,2,1302,4.851351351351352

506142,1,6302685141,"Ode to a pathetic movie of a pathetic generation. Man, they are all feeling sorry for themselves. And to think that they are the offspring of The Greatest Generation that fought and won WWII! They are merely spoiled brats--a shame to the Great Generation that gave birth to them. James Dean is (boo-hoo) misunderstood. Natalie Wood (more boo-hoo) wants to be kissed by Daddy-o and suffers from complexes because of his refusal. Even the ""tough"" guys suffer from a deep-rooted inferiority complex and strive to remedy it by empty-headed bravado which boils down to suicidal stupidity: driving a car over a cliff when their parents bravely fought and some died on the cliffs of Normandy. The inferior melodramatic acting and continuous whimpering are a fitting tribute to the personae involved. The world would wait some twelve years until The Flower Children and the Beatles and Timothy Leary (among  others) came around and taught the world what Peace and Love and Happiness and Do Your Thing are all about.

Having admitted to this the acting and the story were wonderful.  We are fortunate enough to live in Southern California, so we chose to go to Griffith Park Observatory the day before renting the movie, it was very fun seeing that nothing has changed since this was filmed.  The building, the doors, the walkways, all almost the same.  Even inside the observatory looks just like in the movie.

The first disc shows the film in color. The second disc has all the extras including a tribute to James Dean with tributes from Sammy Davis Jr., Sal Mineo, Natalie Wood, and others. Peter Lawson hosted the 1975 tribute to Dean.

There is the film tribute and the making of the film with cast interviews. Nicholas Ray delivered a masterpiece of film making. This film is a teen angst classic and hailed rightfully so.

506561,5,6302685141,"""Rebel Without a Cause"" is a timeless film about the generation gap, parental styles and moral decay. It is interesting though to contrast the moral decay and teen rebellion depicted in this 60 year old film and the environment of today...the characters portrayed by James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo seem almost polite and obedient by comparison. This was Dean's best performance, though he looked too old (at 24) for an 18 year old high schooler. He died at that young age in an auto accident, before the film was even released. Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo were still in their teens and were perfectly cast...it is remarkable how developed their acting skills were at their young ages. You will also see a 19 year old Dennis Hopper and a 24 year old Nick Adams as members of the gang who pursue Dean, Wood and Mineo. As the story develops, Jim Stark (Dean) is the new kid in town. He has been in trouble elsewhere; and his family has had to move before. Here he hopes to find something he doesn't get from his middle-class family. Though he finds love in his relation with Judy (Wood) and a form of friendship Plato (Mineo) Jim must still prove himself to his peers in switchblade fights and ""chickie"" games in which cars race toward a seaside cliff. That will set the stage. If you've never seen this film, you owe it to yourself to watch it at least one; I'm betting you'll be glad you did!",1418428800,,1398,4.486274509803922

It narrates many events of his life like when he meets a girl that he fell in love with,when he disobeyed his parents, and the event when he defieed the local school bullies. It was a groundbreaking attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth and it critiques parental style that led to it. Finally,it explores the differences and conflicts between generations. It stars James Dean,who definitely captured the enigma of his screen persona that made him a legend despite making only three films in his short and legendary career despite not garnering an Academy Award nomination for his performance in it unlike in his two other films - Giant and The East Of Eden.",1412294400,,767,4.731343283582089

506856,5,6302685141,"REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE [1956] [Special Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook] [Blu-ray] More than half a century after its original release, `Rebel Without A Cause' remains one of the most enduring motion pictures of all time. Starring James Dean in what many consider to be his finest performance, this cinematic and cultural milestone is now re-mastered and presented on Blu-ray for the very first time!

Powerfully directed by Nicholas Ray, Dean plays the ultimate teenage rebel and, together with Academy Award nominated costars Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, gives voice to the post-war subculture of troubled American youth. His unforgettable performance is the highlight of a film that was landmark achievement. `Rebel Without A Cause' is included in the Library of Congress' National Film Registry and is on the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 100 Greatest American Movies Of All Time. Since its October 1955 release, `Rebel Without A Cause' has become one of the archetypal films of teenage angst, an enduring hit with successive generations and a harbinger of things to come in the tumultuous Sixties. The fact that all of the film's stars, Nick Adams, James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo died tragically and early on has also lent a mystique to this powerful, ground-breaking film that continues to this day.

FILM FACT: Awards and Accolades: Wins: 1990 National Film Registry. Nominations: Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (Sal Mineo). Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (Natalie Wood).

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The concept of `Rebel Without a Cause' was to focus on telling a story about confused middle class teenagers living in Suburbia. How the story was told, was a different matter altogether. Back in 1955, when the film was first released, the film was controversial at the time as it seemingly depicted teenage rebellion and moral decay in the 1950s. Yet there is a lot that happens in the course of the film that has made it become the classic that it is heralded as. Originally conceived to be a cheaply produced black-and-white movie, Warner Bros had switched the production into a larger budget mode and with colour filming when it became apparent that James Dean was one of the rising stars of the time.

From the opening frame of the film, James Dean began to deliver an iconic performance. He was creatively enmeshed in his characters. The first shots of the film show James Dean lying on the ground. He is playing with a toy monkey. This was improvised. He asked the filmmaker Nicholas Ray if he could try something. This became the opening of the film and quite a fascinating moment. James Dean was capable of such amazing acting. He had so many ideas.

The story of `Rebel Without a Cause' primarily follows the teenagers Jim Stark [James Dean], Judy [Natalie Wood], and Plato [Sal Mineo] as they try to make sense of their lives while a sequence of events sends things spiralling for all of them. At the start of the film, the three teenagers are all in a police station, each needing their parents to get them. Jim's parent's argumentative nature around Jim makes him more restless and distant. Judy's father is shockingly distant from her with a cold detachment. Plato's father abandoned him. The characters in this story each deal with their own feelings of displacement.

One of the greatest sequences in the film is when the characters first meet each other while attending a school field trip to an observatory. There, while witnessing a theoretical show displaying the destruction of the entire universe, the wide expansiveness of the world is seemingly even colder to them than before. It's a perfect metaphor for how the three characters are going through such severe feelings of isolation and misunderstandings.

The performances by James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo are equally great. Each actor brought a memorable performance to the screen. Over the course of the story, Jim and Judy seem somewhat parental to the Plato character. They even enact a 'game' of sorts at one point, inhabiting these roles. James Dean and Natalie Wood had immense screen chemistry together and were perfectly in synch with each other during this film. The confusion and angst felt from the characters was well demonstrated by the performances.

Nicholas Ray did an excellent job as the director of `Rebel Without a Cause.' The story is a complicated one to tell, and was not a small task for Nicholas Ray to attempt to realise as director. Everything about the film was stylistically 'ace' and he managed to have the actors create compelling characters that could be universally fascinating and compelling.

The film has incredible pacing and flows from one scene into the next with a remarkable vitality that's essentially fundamental to the film's success. This universally appealing story was one he managed to tell with a heart and soul in the filmmaking, which makes the tragic ending so powerful that one can truly consider it amongst the best film endings of all time.

Blu-ray Video Quality - In my estimation, `Rebel Without a Cause' is of the best looking film out of the three James Dean films. There is something about its unique visual style that impresses me the most. Perhaps it has something to do with the colour and the way it brings the best out of the costumes, especially the famous red jacket James Dean wore during the film. All three films contain excellent cinematography, and yet I found the work that was done by the Academy Award winning cinematographer Ernest Haller. The original 2.55:1 theatrical aspect ratio has been preserved. The 1080p image quality is splendid and has an average bit-rate is around 25 mbps. This is certainly not a huge sampling rate, but it is on par course for Warner Bros. and it's adequate for this presentation. I found the film to have good colour depth and decent clarity. The film could have been sharper. However, the sharpness in this transfer is notable, nonetheless, and far better when compared to earlier presentations of `Rebel Without a Cause.'

Blu-ray Audio Quality - Unlike the audio presentation of `Giant' received, Warner Bros. has given `Rebel Without a Cause' an audio makeover of sorts with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio presentation. I'm all for keeping the original audio intact but this is actually not that bad of a sound mix for the film. Surprisingly, I found it sounded rather authentic with the material. There's a bit more dimensionality to the mix, especially when the car sequences are taken into account, and with regards to the way score music was implemented. However, I will also maintain that this is an authentic sounding mix that is generally an impressive and satisfactory experience. It's still a front-heavy mix. It implements a good range of bass into the sound-stage. It's simply a nice expansion to the audio presentation and not an awful attempt at utilising sound effects beyond their capabilities. Film fans won't feel disappointed by the presentation as long as the audio-purist in them doesn't kick it into over-drive on this one.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary By Douglas L. Rathgeb [Author Of The Making Of Rebel Without A Cause] Douglas L. Rathgeb recorded this commentary before publishing The Making of Rebel Without a Cause [2010], but he was obviously already at work researching the book. While he tends to fall too easily into describing the action on screen, his commentary is full of interesting details concerning the film's production, with particular emphasis on issues with the Production Code, which peppered the project with questions and concerns.

James Dean Remembered [1:06:22] This 1974 documentary was shown on ABC's Wide World of Entertainment series. Hosted by Peter Lawford, it features interviews with Sammy Davis, Jr., Steve Allen, Natalie Wood, Leonard Rosenman and Sal Mineo.

Rebel Without a Cause: Defiant Innocents [36:30] This 2005 documentary traces the development and production of the film, although many of the participants were no longer available. The major contributor is screenwriter Stewart Stern, whose distinctive voice seemed to mesh most closely with director Nicholas Ray's original inspiration for the film. Other participants include author Rathgeb, Dean biographer William Bast, Faye Nuell (Natalie Wood's stunt double), Beverly Long (Helen), Frank Mazzola (Crunch), Corey Allen (Buzz), Jack Grinnage (Moose), Steffi Sidney (Mil) and, briefly, Dennis Hopper.

Vintage Documentary: James Dean Remembered [1:06:22] This 1974 documentary was shown on ABC's Wide World of Entertainment series. Hosted by Peter Lawford, it features interviews with Sammy Davis, Jr., Steve Allen, Natalie Wood, Leonard Rosenman and Sal Mineo.

Dennis Hopper: Memories From The Warner Lot [10:31] In this candid interview conducted late in his life, Hopper recalls his years as a Warner contract player, with emphasis on his roles in 'Rebel Without a Cause' and 'Giant.'

Screen Tests [6:27] Sal Mineo, James Dean and Natalie Wood.

Wardrobe Tests [5:05] Primarily James Dean and Corey Allen, with various gang members forming different groups.

Black & White Deleted Scenes [Without Sound] [2.55:1] No ""play all"" feature is included: Kids Exit the Planetarium [2:42]; Gang Outside the Planetarium [1:12]; Gang Outside the Planetarium (Alternate Angle) [2:41]; Plato on the Bus [3:01] and Kids Run Down the Ramp [0:55]

Colour Deleted Scenes [Without Sound] [2.55:1] No ""play all"" feature is included: Kids Drive Up to School [1:36]; Kids Walk Up to School [0:57]; Kids Leave School [0:31]; Jim Sees Judy [0:55]; Kids Leave the Planetarium Auditorium [3:04]; Jim Hustled into Precinct [0:51]; Gang Attacks Plato [0:49]; Gang Attacks Man [1:43]; Cops Arrive at the Planetarium [0:58]; Parents Arrive at the Planetarium [1:20] and Alternate Ending [0:36]

Behind the Cameras [1.33:1] A series of promos, narrated by Gig Young and almost unbearably stiff. The listing by name is somewhat misleading, because Wood and Dean are interviewed only briefly. Dean's interview, which came to be known as the ""drive safe"" spot, is positively eerie: Natalie Wood (7:57); Jim Backus (5:47) and James Dean (7:44)

Theatrical Trailer [1080p] [2:25].

PLUS: Stunning 44 Page Book and includes Rare Memos, Trivia and Behind The Scenes Photos.

Finally, the dynamic and influential `Rebel Without a Cause' seemed to speak to an entire generation when it was first released. I feel that is still the case today and it will be the case tomorrow: Future generations of film lovers will find something to connect to in this essential masterpiece. The Picture Quality resulting from MPI's restoration efforts are fantastic and this is a must-own Blu-ray of an important film in American cinema. That is why I am so honoured to add this to my other Two James Dean Special Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook Blu-ray Collection, as this is history in the making and you will be a fool not to purchase these classic James Dean films. Highly Recommended!

He befriends that kid that had no friends. They have this run and this other kid and his gang. It was called a ""Chicken Run"". The first one to jump out of their cars was called a chicken. Well James won and the other kid got stuck in his car and went over the cliff. So his gang of friends went looking for James to hurt him.

Every teen girl should meet James Dean. He was so deep and intense and emotional.  And Natalie Wood was charming and sad and had trouble figuring out the world around her, as did Dean. The saddest character was Sal Mineo. Here were three teens (or so-called teens as they were slightly older) who had issues that were not sugar-coated. Sadly all three died tragic deaths in real life.  I bought this DVD for my teen granddaughter who really loves old movies. (To me old movies means Cary Grant. To her, this is old).  She cried.

Actually, thats not from this movie; its from _The Blob_. Still, there are parallels. You have the teenagers, who are troubled and mostly nice but misunderstood. (Even the bad guy in _Rebel_ is this way.) You have the Fifties, which were also mostly nice, but misunderstood. Aside from these things, though, _The Blob_ had a blob! Yeah yeah. I know, its a gimmick. OTOH, its a useful gimmick. In the first place, its a source of dramatic tension other than (and richer than) the misunderstood teenagers themselves. Secondly, and equally importantly, its a cue to audiences that the movie isn't taking itself too seriously. And thirdly, its well, its a gimmick! Is that so terrible? (Cmon! You heard of the movie, aincha?)

_Rebel_ doesnt have a blob, and without that element, the movie itself is amorphous. Stop it! Yer tearin me apart! Like. So? What does that mean? We don't know. Nobody tells us. Put a werewolf in front of that guy, though, and everything falls into place! I mean I hate to knock a cultural icon and all, but Deans character  and the rest of the movie - are just a teensy bit overwrought, doncha think? _Rebel Without a Cause_? More like _Rebel Without an Objective Correlative_.

As for Sal Mineo, was anyone ever more expendable? He must have been all but irresistible to blobs, werewolves, vampires, and mummies  all of which were undoubtedly haunting  sound stages in the very same compound. They must have had to stake out the perimeter just to protect this chubby cheeked cherubs chitterlings. Shoulda just let them all in; they would have had a much better story.

OK. Nobodys gonna like this review. I still say it needs a werewolf or a blob. Heck! Id take a guy in a rubber suit! Im trying to tell people _Rebel_ is a lousy movie, and nobody will believe me cause Im a curmudgeon!",1386028800,8,1941,4.674486803519062

All is not for naught however because Jim's father (Jim Bachus) vows to be a better parent then he was before.

It's not by any means the worst I've ever seen, but I was left completely cold by it.  I'll try to explain why.  First, I did not find anything to like about any of the characters, except perhaps Plato.  Dean's character was much too alienating; and this coming from a person who has always preferred to spend time with society's misfits.  I didn't find much substance to Wood's character, either.  I do not ""require"" a film to have likable characters, but if I find NOTHING in them to connect to, then I must turn to plot, theme, setting, and costume to find value.  The plot was somewhat interesting, but not earth-shattering.  The setting and costumes, too, were okay.  There are enduring and important themes here, so I'm giving it two stars.  No more.  Call me vapid, but if I'm going to watch a teen film, give me ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""Clueless"" any day.

507289,5,6302685141,"In modern times we think it's normal and even expected that there are movies talking about teenagers. We are surrounded by TV shows, novels, movies, and other systems that all view the world through teenage eyes. But back in the 1940s and 1950s, that wasn't the case. Movies were about adults and how adults handled things. Rebel Without a Cause became an instant classic because finally there was a movie from a teen's point of view. It showed the issues and challenges that teens were facing in a world recovering from World War II.

Undoubtedly parents of the time thought teens had it easy. After all, the war was over. All the hardships and rationing and trauma involved with the war was a thing of the past. ""You kids never had it so good"". They had nice clothes and a life free from being sent to war. But to the teens of the time, they had a new set of challenges.

Mineo grows up with everything money can buy - but not the affection of his parents. They aren't even at home - they've left him behind with a caretaker. Wood craves her father's love and affection - but he apparently has become distant as she became more womanly. He's uncomfortable hugging her.

And then there's Dean. His parents seem wealthy, and seem to care for him. But they argue about him constantly. Also, the movie makes quite a big deal about how ""masculine"" the mom is, vs how ""feminine"" the father is. One of Dean's plaintive cries is that he wants his father to stand up for him - but the father just looks away.

It can be tempting to dismiss the issues these kids face. So many modern movies tackle teens who grapple with being abused, who are sucked into gang life, and many other quite painful situations. Still, it's important to look at this as a starting point. At least we get to see what the teens' challenges are. And from there we could then delve into even more serious problems as the years move forward.

It's also, of course, a view into a specific period in time. The men are doing all the action and talking. The girls are just there as arm-candy. Wood is the only woman in the film with any real lines. The mom and grandmom are simply there to show the ""problems of a too-strong woman"". Even the female teacher is ineffective.

But apparently, in the end, Wood is necessary. The only time in the entire movie that Dean's mother and father agree is when they see Dean with Wood on his arm. They both smile contentedly to each other, as if to say ""OK everything will be fine now, he has a girl"".

It's poignant that the three main stars of this movie - Dean, Wood, and Mineo - all died tragically at a young age. Maybe it does show how even those we feel might ""have it made"" face challenges that are not necessarily obvious. It shows we should have sympathy for everyone around us, no matter what their status in life. We all have burdens we have to shoulder.

Well recommended.",1344297600,,2884,4.407894736842105
507290,5,6302685141,"Look at the picture of James Dean in the photo on the DVD. Punky looking.  A kind of ""smirk"" on his face.  Older photos had a lit cigarette dangling from his lips.  Images like that NEVER appealed to me and therefore, neither did this film. Never had any interest in seeing it.  And I would not.  But one night, some 22 years or more back, I was up, couldn't sleep, around 2 a.m., flipping through the (then fewer) cable channels.  NOTHING good was on the tv. I stumbled across this film.  Didn't know what it was. I said, oh, so this is the famous James Dean, eh, and started watching just out of curiosity.  WITHIN MINUTES, I was addicted to this story and could not, would not, turn away.  The acting was incredible, so convincing I forgot that I was looking at James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo.  These performers went beyond amazing. These characters came to life.  I had to close my door in case any in my family got up and walked by my door because, several times in this film, I, a grown man, was sobbing.  I don't mind admitting to that, but it was a reaction, especially to a movie I had heretofore had no interest at all in seeing, a reaction that I never expected.  Quite unexpectedly, one night over 22 years ago, I unexpectedly discovered one of the most beautiful and touching films I have ever seen in my entire life.  REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE will always remain a beloved favorite of mine. The story is gripping and gut-wrenching and the actors (now all sadly having passed on) give utterly unforgettable performances. If you have never seen this film, by all means do.  And if you have, and don't have a copy of it yet, then you KNOW you need to get one.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough.

507342,5,6302685141,"typically people say that the movie predicted the rise of alienated youth of the sixties, disgusted with the hypocritical, repressive past, but nothing is said about the male/female dynamics. That aspect of the movie does not fit with the rebellious youth aspect, so it is ignored. To someone who sees it after reading about it for many years, that part was a surprise.

My father wants to be my pal, Jim (Dean) says to the policemen in the beginning.  Jim says, I love him, I don't want to hurt him, but obviously, Jim does not want a pal but a father with authority.

It seems strange to us now, but in the fifties many were concerned that the American female was emasculating the American male. Many wrote about it. Sociologists and other intellectual types thought it was a real problem.

Jim (Dean) complains that his mother eats his father alive, and if he only had the guts to knock Mom cold once, maybe she would be happy and she'd stop picking on the father. Jim identifies his father's weakness as causing his mother's discontent. His father does not inspire respect. He is not masculine. The more the father gives in to the mother, the more she despises him. Also, the grandmother continually knocks the father. The weak male is surrounded by strong hostile females. The feminist explanation would be that the woman is frustrated by not having a career.

How extensive female or societal hostility towards males was in the fifties, I don't know. It exists today. The more liberated women become and the more they get men to agree with their feminist goals, the more the women have contempt for the men. It is one of the great ironies of feminism.

Jim says, I don't want to be like my father. When he sees his father wearing an apron, the look on his face is priceless and here Dean does a great bit of acting. He registers a mixture of love, pity, anger, contempt. He smiles at his father, but you can see he wants to cry. Strange to think that in a few years, men would be encouraged to do just what Jim's father was doing. Jim is humiliated for his father. His father drops a tray and is anxious. Stand up, his son tells him, what can happen if she sees it? The son cannot bear that the father fears the mother.

Jim tries to get his father to tell him what to do about being called chicken. Should Jim defend his honor? Is that what a man does? His father has no answer. He can't tell him take the challenge. He can't tell him ignore those kids, they're wrong. So Jim goes to defend his honor. He realizes his life at the school would be unsupportable with the reputation of ""chicken.""  Later, when he decides to go to the police, he begs his father to support him against his mother. Tell her, he says, Stand up for me, Dad. His father, weak, indecisive, does not.

The movie does not explicitly say whether upholding honor is wrong or right. The whole chickie run is a waste of energy and leads to a young man's demise. At the same time, the audience is intended to respect Jim for taking the challenge.

In the end, Jim has a sort of happy ending. His father becomes stronger, You can depend on me, son, he says. Trust me. I'll be as strong as you want me to be. The mother smiles through her tears, seemingly accepting that her husband has a special role as father.

The issues raised have not been resolved. They are more pressing than ever. The old definition of manly honor is gone, not for most of the world, to be sure, but for the west. But then what is it to be a man? Is he really supposed to be the same as a woman? Is there no masculine quality or strength that is unique to the sex?",1314316800,2,3612,4.368107302533532

507397,4,6302685141,"As a film, `Rebel Without a Cause' works very well.  It is dated and strategically melodramatic in parts, but overall the film is, for all intensive purposes, cinematic magic.  While I cannot say that it is without faults, and I will admit that upon watching it the first time I was left bewildered at its following and found it underwhelmed, the fact remains that the film, bolstered by a brilliant lead performance, has the ultimate staying power.  I found myself unable to stop thinking about it for weeks.  I just had to watch it again.  I had to watch it with others to get their perspective on the film.  It became somewhat of an obsession for me.  When the dust had settled I realized that regardless of the films problems, I love it for what it is.

Coming at things from the viewpoint of a teenager, `Rebel Without a Cause' was a landmark in film.  Sadly, that status was only exemplified by the unfortunate loss of its lead actor; James Dean.  This actor made a serious splash on the big screen with three marvelously textured performances, but this is marred forever by the fact that he died before he could see the fruits of his labor.

His legacy lives on, and rightfully so, in the television screens of millions.

As Jim Stark, James Dean unearthed a giant.  He took a character that was misunderstood and underappreciated by most of Hollywood giants and created something universally `felt'.  Jim Stark is a part of us all; a confused teenager who craves attention but doesn't know how to get it.  He's a warm hearted young man who is misjudged by those around him, a man deeply affected by his role models; plagued by a future he doesn't want to embrace.  He is you and me and everyone we know, and James Dean made sure that we understood that.  What is so remarkable about this performance is that Dean was able to transcend stereotypes by layering Stark with so many contradictory emotions.  I remember reading a novel not too long ago that referred to teenagers as `acceptably schizophrenic'.  Their behavior doesn't make sense due to the increase of hormones and it is acceptable; normal even.  That is why this characterization makes so much sense in this film.  Dean attacked every emotional upheaval with enough connective tissue to make Jim Stark make total sense.

The supporting cast is good as well.  Natalie Wood is endearing with the right amount of flirtation to make her accessible.  Sal Mineo doesn't quite handle the emotional fluctuations with the same amount of ease as Dean (he comes off whinny and forced in many instanced) but his character itself has the arc needed to flesh out Jim Stark's inevitabilities.  You can't have one without the other.  I also really loved Jim Backus as Stark's dominated father.

In the end I totally recommend this film.  Like I said, I love it.  It tackles important themes in the life of the average teen, a time when emotions run high and logic is, well, illogical.  The film does feel very dated and can at times feel corny when considered in the context of `today' or `mainstream cinema', but when fawned over as the classic it really is those comparisons should not be made.  I do strongly believe that the film is remembered more for James Dean and his magnificent performance than for the actual quality of the film itself, but James Dean aside, this is still a very good film.",1300320000,2,3355,4.664395229982964

As for the movie, everyone should see it, Rebel Without a Cause is as timeless as a movie can be. It captures the essence of the struggle of growing up in a post WWII world--where family and gender roles are constantly being redefined. It recognizes that things are changing. James Dean and Natalie Wood give powerful performances as their characters struggle to deal with the changing world. It is simple yet profound, and says a lot without ever seeming to say anything at all. It doesn't preach, it just gives clever dialogue, incredible performances, and haunting scenes. Then it leaves you thinking about it long after the movie is over.

507454,4,6302685141,"One does not have to a consummate academic historian of the modern bourgeois family (since the 1700s), like the late Professor Lawrence Stone, to realize that being a teenager, of any class and in any period in the modern era is fraught with terror, danger, loneliness, and maddening experiences as one tries to cope with a world that one has not made, or been asked about making. While the teen angst and alienation issues shift over time, and as a general proposition have gotten more baffling, they tend to follow that above-mentioned pattern. Except that the rich and the middle class have more resources than the working class and poor to ""cushion"" the blows.

And that last statement kind of sums up the film under review, ""Rebel Without A Cause"". The troubles of one Jim Stark (played by short-lived, hard living, hard driving, and I don't mean just automobiles, but eternally worshipped ""heartthrob"", James Dean), his wanna-be girl, Judy, (played by nice girl gone slightly wrong Natalie Wood), and his wanna-be friend the forever ""lost"" boy, Plato, (played to a tee by Sal Mineo) seem minor compared to today's mass assault on teen sensibility. The film  nevertheless disclosed in its own way the attempt to gather in the youth tribe (or, rather tribes) as our hero, Jim, tries to assert his manhood, his personhood, and his ""style"" in a post-World War II up and coming  bourgeois community  (California, of course) that just want to make ""nice."" ""Rumblefish"", ""The Flatlanders"" or any of S.E.Hinton's master works this is not, but as a slice, a thin slice, of dealing with the complexities of teen angst, and how adult writers and filmmakers think that it plays out as a reflection of their society at a particular period, it is worth a watch.",1279756800,2,1753,4.852842809364549

507481,5,6302685141,"Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel without a cause' is one of those layered parables that lends itself very easily to analysis - and could be deconstructed several different ways.. What appeals to me beyond the substance of this movie is the very simple ways in which it grasps the viewer.. and usually when people talk about the movie they focus on the emotion of Dean's performance.
It strikes me that the subtle way Ray takes the triangular structure of parenthood is so very neatly reflected and amplified in the new triangular relationship that is formed later in the film (Dean, wood, and mineo).. This new triangle seems almost a dream but it is riddled with the same problems of the first and ends with the unfortunate but fitting climax.. Ray takes an eternally interesting struggle and perpetuates it with no clear resolution - as would normally be seen in a film from the 1950's.
Even when taking into consideration all of the other elements that are subtley thrown in - Freud, homosexuality, 'man alone' - it is the simplicity of the structure of the film and its uniformity that impress me the most..

I only have 2 real complaints about the product. The first is that the discs are dual sided, instead of one per film. I know this isn't earth shattering but it's much easier for the disc to get scratched. TCM could have chipped in the extra $2 or whatever it is so each film would have been on a separate disc.

The other problem I have is the video transfer. Overall the transfers are okay but none look that great. Rebel Without A Cause was a big disappointment as many parts of the frame during scenes are blurred, pigmented, and have colors fading/warping. I understand this is usual for older films but a restoration would have been nice.

In conclusion, if you are a film buff I would recommend this. I got mine elsewhere for only $16, making it only $4 a film so it was a steal. Any classic film buff or James Dean fan will love this set.",1238544000,44,1021,4.307291666666667
507484,5,6302685141,"Teenaged Jim Stark (James Dean) has just moved to a new town and wants to fit in with the local greasers. However, things go horribly wrong when a game of Chicken between Stark and one of the greasers ends in the greaser's death.

Although not the first cinematic depiction of the 1950's youth culture (""The Wild One"" was made two years earlier), ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is one of the best of these such films. Unlike ""The Wild One"", which barely even had a plot, ""Rebel Without a Cause"" has a strong storyline which would probably still work if it were remade today, and Jim Stark is a far more realistic character than Brando's Johnny Strabler. It is essentially a coming of age film, chronicling Jim Stark's transition from irresponsible teenager, to adulthood, as he is effectively forced to become a ""parent"" to a troubled young friend of his, who sees him as a hero.

As it was made in the 50's, many of the characters feel as though they were taken straight out of ""Grease"" (for example, the greasers, who appear to comb their hair every two seconds), which makes the film somewhat laughable to begin with, but as the film progresses and takes a serious turn, you forget this pretty quickly. Jim Stark, however, with his iconic red jacket and a cigarette hanging from his mouth, still seems as cool as he must have seemed in 1955, and after seeing this film, I finally understand why James Dean's legend has lived on for more than 50 years after his death.",1234915200,2,1463,4.580152671755725

507486,5,6302685141,"This is one of the first of what is planned to be 27 sets of four films each from Warner Home Video. They are bare-bones releases of classic movies sold at a discount to introduce classic film to the masses. That is a good idea, and for that I salute Warner Home Video. This set is about romantic dramas, with an emphasis on the works of Tennessee Williams and James Dean. The following are the contents of this set:

East of Eden (1955) - Directed by Elia Kazan and starring James Dean. Adam Trask is a California farmer with two sons - Aron and Cal. Cal feels that his father holds him in only medium esteem while he gushes over Aron. Cal also learns what really happened to his mother, and begins visiting her. When Adam loses a fortune in a failed shipping venture, Cal decides to win Adam's favor by going into business himself and getting his father's money back. However, he decides to go to his mother to get his start-up capital.

Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) - Directed by Richard Brooks, stars Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as his wife, Maggie. Brick is an alcoholic ex-football hero who has the favor of his father, played by Burl Ives. Brick's older brother does everything the way his father says to do it, but still does not have his father's heart. The problems in this disfunctional family rise to the surface when it is learned that ""Big Daddy"" doesn't have long to live.

Streetcar Named Desire (1951) - Directed by Elia Kazan starring Marlon Brando as Stanley, the brutish bridegroom of Stella (Kim Hunter). Stella has an older sister Blanche (Vivien Leigh) who acts as though she is a southern belle rather than an aging woman with a dreary existence in the French quarter of New Orleans. When Stanley hears Blanche encouraging Stella to leave him, he plots a cruel revenge.

Rebel Without a Cause (1955) - Directed by Nicholas Rey, stars James Dean and Natalie Wood in a film that is more about the disenchantment of the modern teenager with society than it is a romantic drama classic. It's a different kind of romance. At face value you could say the two wind up together because they both feel so alone, but there is a real chemistry and attachment there that is beyond just emotional survival.

These romantic dramas are often more dramatic than romantic, but they are all five stars. As is common in this Warner series, these films have more deluxe editions in DVD sets if you are interested.

507489,5,6302685141,"This is a great film that ultimately is about families and their inability to communicate.  Just like the more modern tv drama ""The O.C."" this film shows that behind the clean facade of rich, well-to-do neighbourhoods lies the broken pieces of parents who are unable to relate to their children who in turn end up looking for this missing love and understanding in all the wrong places with violent and destructive effects.

Dean's character is ashamed of his father who in his eyes is hen-pecked and cowardly and he insists upon good answers from his father as to why he is feeling the typical hormone-induced depression that most teenagers go through and when that is not forthcoming, he rebels in an attempt to hurt his parents.  Wood's character is similar in that she also has communication problems with her father who is uncomfortable with physical closeness now that his daughter has become an attractive teen perhaps in an over-reaction to his own incestual desires?  Confused at his behaviour Wood's character believes her father hates her and so she too rebels in an attempt to hurt him.  Mineo's character is the most pitiful and perhaps most deserving of sympathy; his parents are divorced and they truly appear not to care about him at all leaving him alone with a live-in maid as sole companion.  This film is truly touching for me as I can personally relate based upon my own experiences growing up with many of the issues portrayed here.

The dvd is also a treat as the bonus features contains a couple of good behind-the-scenes documentaries and except for a few minutes at the start, the picture quality is very good and the sound quality has been remastered very well in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround making this the best old movie picture and sound quality-wise that I've seen on dvd to date.

507541,4,6302685141,"This film's title has always bugged me for any number of reasons. First, the title is a total misfit. Every adolescent star here has a cause for rebellion. Dean's father (Backus) is a real piece of work, his mother is Napoleonic,and Granny does nothing but help reinforce Mommy. Woods'father belongs in ICU AT Bellevue, or behind bars for abuse. Mineo is the proverbial misit whose psychiatric treatments have been cut off. Secondly,even though director Nicholas Ray gave Dean plenty of room to improvise, we are left with 2 dead, 1 wounded, one knife attack, multiple arrests, with the elder Backuses smiling at day's end, all within 18 hours in suburbia 1955. Realism? Next, we have a superb acting job by the 3 protagonists, but silly, often unprofessional acting by all that surround them. Who's running the zoo? Finally, I'll go to my grave believing that ""East of Eden"" was Dean's best effort, with this film a mere symbol of what might have been.",1203984000,3,953,4.852760736196319

During the film I never got the feeling that this was even a half hearted attempt at describing real life.  The fact that this false, artificial, self involved movie was a touchstone for a generation of the same qualities should tell you something about the decline of our society, and not just the decline of Hollywood filmmaking.

507543,4,6302685141,"I went to high school in the late 1970's when 50's memorabilia was a big fad and silly, feel good, nostalgic shows like HAPPY DAYS (remember the Fonz?) and LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY ruled the airwaves and the movie GREASE was a box office phenomenon.  I had always heard the 50's described as a happy wholesome idyllic time for America and especially American teenagers.  What a shock then to see REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE a film actually made in 1955 with its contemporary depiction of self-destructive, angst ridden, upper middle class teenagers and their very dysfunctional families.

The film opens at an LA police station where the three main characters, high school students Jim (James Dean), Judy (Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo), have all been brought for unrelated offenses.  Jim's been picked up for drunkenness and has just moved to the area after an apparently trouble filled past and his ambitious parents are anxious for him to make a good impression at his new school.  Judy is a beautiful popular girl who is having lots of problems at home and was taken in to custody for breaking curfew.  Plato the small child like character played by Sal Mineo has absent parents and is being raised by a maid.  He has committed the most disturbing crime as he has shot some puppies.

We see the three the next day at their high school and later at a symbol laden field trip to the planetarium at Griffith Park.  An altercation occurs at the observatory there which leads to a tragic ""chickie run"" on the bluffs over the Pacific Ocean.  Within the same 24 hour period Jim Judy and Plato draw close and even make a makeshift family of each other.  More tragedy is still in store for the kids and the climax shifts back again to the Griffith Park observatory.

At times the film seems somewhat corny to modern viewers in part because of the dramatic musical score (very typical of the movie's day) that is too often played to punctuate climatic scenes.  The movie also is a bit heavy handed in its symbolism.  Jim's dad wears an apron over his suit to show how he is whipped by his wife, the theme of the planetarium show is the destruction of the earth, and Jim's awful mother's painting just happens to be standing near the doorway so Jim can kick through it when he storms out after a climatic fight. Much of the movie seems to have been filmed on location and there is a real feeling of LA in the 1950's throughout.

There is some overacting but overall the lead characters do a good job. James Dean is very charismatic in the film and the viewer can see why he still has a cult following.  This is especially true when the morbid fact that he had been dead for about a month before this film was released is considered.  Natalie Wood is very believable as the emotionally confused Judy.  And Sal Mineo is heartbreaking as the troubled Plato who as his caretaker/maid says has ""nobody"".  The major themes of the film can resonate with parents and teens of today and this is a must see for any film lover.",1195689600,5,3003,4.548327137546468

507547,5,6302685141,"Rebel Without a Cause is the first movie of James Dean's that I've ever seen. I plan to watch his other two because this one was so good that I didn't want it to end. James Dean was one of the most beautiful actors I've ever seen. It wasn't just the way he looked,(though that helps of course) but he also had this charismatic way about him that makes you want to watch his every move.

I think that's why, as I was watching the movie, I started noticing that he reminded me very much of the character Ryan Atwood on the OC.  I first noticed the way James Dean looked at people.  He had the same manner as Ryan does on the OC. James Dean moves his eyes to the right or the left sometimes instead of straight ahead. His eyebrows raise slightly and his smile is never more than a grin. It's a very endearing quality and it's why I noticed it so quickly into the movie.

 Then I noticed the way James Dean smoked. James Dean made smoking cigarettes look like an art form instead of something that could cause cancer. lol And in the first episode of the OC, Ryan took out a cigarette was he was talking to Marissa and he looked exactly like James Dean did. At the time though, I just thought Ryan was being very ""cool"" and ""sexy"" since I'd never seen Rebel without a Cause. I had no idea the two looked so very much alike in their mannerisms.

There are other similarities to the movie and to the OC,  such as the mansion the trio run to in the movie, and the model home on the OC where the teens on there go to hide Ryan. I'm not sure if this look for the character Ryan Atwood was done on purpose to make him seem like a 'James Dean' type or if the storyline was just a coincidence but my point in saying all this is that I think kids today can relate to this movie. Even  though Rebel without a Cause was made over 50 years ago, teens today deal with parental issues, peer pressure, rejection and feelings of first love.

I would recommend this movie to anyone ... especially teenagers .... who get tired of the same type movie they see over and over. Rebel without a cause is a true classic and I hope that anyone that hasn't seen it, gives it a chance and watches it just to see for themselves that not all movies that are old, are 'old fashion' and boring. This one is great and it's one I could, and will watch many times. And I'd really like to add that OC fans should watch it just to see what I'm talking about. I'd like to see if anyone else noticed what I did.",1176768000,7,2468,4.114345114345114

True, the Communist scare and the war in Korea marred all the good news, but there was something underneath all the happy families living in the suburbs with pink bathrooms or bedrooms.  Teenagers were looking for something more relevant in their lives.  Reble Without A Cause reflected what appeared to be teenage angst but these feelings are what swelled into the rebellion and demonstrations of the 60s.

The two disc DVD has good information about the making of this movie with cast and production people.  It is a sad irony that the three leads died too soon.",1170028800,9,776,4.885496183206107
507549,5,6302685141,"Jim Stark (James Dean) is a lonely desperate teenager, who supposedly hasn't a friend in the world when we first see him lying drunk in an L.A gutter... But his personality is such that within a twenty-four-hour period he makes friends with Plato (Sal Mineo) and Judy (Natalie Wood), two misunderstood teenagers completely different from each other and himself...

Every tempestuous young boy who considers himself friendless, confused, and aimless, can easily identify with Jim... For the youth of the middle 1950's, Dean's screen image was a symbol of loneliness, anger, and frustration...

Jim's appealing characteristics are his sincerity, his warmth toward Judy, his concern for his friend Plato (whom no one else likes) his protectiveness, his shyness, his bravery, his good looks, his tender way of kissing, and his desperate need to be loved...

Jim is a troubled new student in a high school in Los Angeles, who is not only willing to reveal that he loves his father, but also has the capacity to cry - which he does often... His one bad characteristic is his violent nature, but at least his fury is not directed at Judy or his friend Plato... He meets these two in jail, where he has been taken on a drunk and disorderly charge...

Jim and Julie have an immediate connection, and Plato warns them against Julie's boyfriend, Buzz... Buzz and his gang slash the tires of Jim's cars and a fight ensues... The boys decide to settle their differences by having a 'chicken run.' Each will drive a stolen car toward the brink of a cliff, and the first to jump before the automobile lunges over will be a coward...

In the 1950s, the two basic ways that youth could rebel seemed to be through acts of violence and delinquency and through gathering into groups and being directed by a group leader... Richard Brooks' ""Blackboard Jungle"" vividly described that situation...

As teenagers we liked being called 'rebels.' At that age we weren't out to destroy the 'system,' but like Jim we wanted the 'system' to become more sensitive to our needs, to apologize for being careless, and to make us part of the existing order...

At that age we recognized Jim's failure to communicate with his parents, and the way he mumbled when he thought no one was listening and started his sentences over, louder and clearer... He was our ideal... Everything he said was so right, so clever, so cool...

When the unfriendly Judy calls him a YoYo and runs off to join her friends, he says softly, ""I love you, too."" When the now friendly Judy asks him why he kissed her on the forehead, he says simply: ""I felt like it."" When Buzz asks him if he knows what a ""chickie run"" is, he fibs, ""That's all I ever do."" When Plato asks him if he can keep his jacket, Jim exclaims, ""Well, what do you think?""

At that age Nicholas Ray's teenagers were hopelessly confused, seeking advice and getting no answers... Their confusion was symbolized by Plato's mismatched socks... Jim, Judy, and Plato pretend to be a family unit based on a mutual trust and understanding, the only structure which can combat the cosmic emptiness of 'man alone.'

'Rebel Without a Cause' is the first film to suggest that juvenile violence is not necessarily bred in the poor neighborhoods... It is the disenchanted cry of youth, neglected by their parents, and alienated from the adult world...

Judy sobs that her father stops kissing her when she was sixteen, and causes her pain when he labels her a 'dirty tramp.' Plato is lost and in despair because his absent, divorced parents have left him completely in the care of a black housekeeper... During questioning, he asserts: ""Nobody can help me.""

In watching 'Rebel Without a Cause,' we can see the desperate father-son relationship, the need to be loved and understood as an individual... That is why 'Rebel Without a Cause' is the best of the alienated-youth films of the period, and the most emotional of films...

Dean's death in an automobile accident in 1955 was a crippling blow to one of the most characteristic elements of fifties cinema...",1168473600,2,4057,4.786838340486409
507580,5,6302685141,"""Rebel Without a Cause,"" the film that made James Dean a star and a film that still seems relevant today. If you ignore the style and words that the characters use, kids are still like this today. #59 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List the film stars Dean as Jim Stark. When we meet Jim, he is stumbling drunkenly through the streets. He's arrested and at the police station we meet the other two major players Plato (Sal Mineo) and Judy (Natalie Wood). Plato, nowadays, would be a likely candidate for a school shooter. In the police station, we learn that he was arrested for shooting puppies. He's a lonely kid, with no parents and no friends. Judy is a typical-High schoolgirl, who hangs out with the local gang and has Daddy-issues. Jim, himself, is the new kid in town trying to find a place to belong. His parents are constantly fighting (in one famous scene early on he reveals ""You're tearing me apart!"") and constantly moving him around. While on a field trip to the Planetarium (an odd thing to do on the first day of school), he finds himself in a knife fight with the head of the local gang, Buzz. Jim wins, but is challenged to a game later that night that involves two people driving a car towards the edge of a cliff and whoever jumps out first is a ""chicken."" The movie, miraculously, takes place over the course of a day...Odd, since it has enough events to fill at least a month of time. This is the first film I've seen with James Dean and this is a terrific performance, making it not hard to see why he has remained a screen-icon all these years. Many people will recognize while watching the film that it still works to this day. Kids don't dress like this or call each other ""chicken"" anymore (unless they're in Kindergarten); Knife fights aren't ""in"" but it still manages to capture the feelings and problems one has in adolescence. It's one of the few ""classic"" movies that modern-day kids will be able to enjoy as well as their parents.

His attidute is a reaction against hypocrisy and puritan drivel. It isn't a violent reaction. It is a kind of carelessness, a cavalier attitude, something that says you have no power against it... except to be yourself.

This is what Dean was. He was himself. That's what this movie is about. It not so much about being a rebel or not fitting in. It is a James Dean movie. Everything about his movie center itself and revolves around Dean, his mannerisms, what he says, what he does and what he doesn't.

There is a lot of dichotomy in this movie. He gets the girl but not without social disapproval. He gets challenged to a race off, but the other guy dies. He seems calm enough, but there is a rage from deep within. In the end, the only answer for Dean's character is to resign not only to the fate of events, but that he has to live with himself, for better or for worse.",1149984000,2,1053,4.422680412371134

507587,5,6302685141,"A film ""classic"" about teenage alienation and angst that spoke to a generation, but not the masterpiece many make it out to be. James Dean is Jim Starr, a high school senior with overbearing, out-of-touch parents (Jim Backus plays his father, who walks around the house in an apron - a symbol of his ""weakness as a man""), new in town, trying to fit in with the crowd. The movie addresses all the concerns of teenagers in the mid-1950s (maybe even of all time): parents, authority, friendship, loyalty, proving oneself, searching for values), but the tone the movie takes is only on par with a soap opera. Some of it is laughably corny and outdated today, yet it's not hard to see how it could have been so influential. Dean is good in the role as the young rebel - mysterious, strong-willed, sexy - but most of the others come across as mere types. The game of chicken between Dean and Buzz (played by Corey Allen) of course presaged Dean's own death only months later.",1135728000,,969,4.542857142857143

507599,5,6302685141,"SEPTEMBER 30TH--Screen icon James Dean died exactly fifty years ago today in a tragic automobile crash in California's central valley.  With EAST OF EDEN and REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (both 1955), made back to back before his untimely death at age 24, Dean immortalized himself for an entire generation.  Both films are devastating and emotionally overwhelming even today in their portraits of dissatisfied young people in conflict with their parents and one another.  Of the two, I prefer director Nicholas Ray's REBEL, with a brilliant screenplay by Stewart Stern.

The setting is 1955 Los Angeles, where Dean's Jim Stark is the new boy in high school.  He inevitably comes into conflict with a gang led by Corey Allen and a very young Dennis Hopper, among others.  (Trivia note:  Dean and Hopper are both featured prominently in GIANT, released the following year.)  A knife fight at hilltop Griffith Observatory leads to a deadly ""Chicken Run"".  The settings are imaginative, including the observatory and an abandoned mansion in the Hollywood Hills with an empty swimming pool.  I was reminded of the old house and pool in Billy Wilder's SUNSET BLVD. (1950).

(CAUTION:  PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT.)  REBEL also stars Natalie Wood as Judy and Sal Mineo as Plato; both give Oscar-nominated and unforgettable performances.  Judy has parents who are unpleasant.  Dad William Hopper slaps her when she kisses his cheek, while Mom Rochelle Hudson just sort of stands by.  ""This is not my house!"" Judy says after one slap too many and runs out into the night.  Plato lives with a house maid; I believe his parents are dead.  But the real spotlight is on Jim's parents, weakling Jim Backus and strong-willed Ann Doran who keeps berating Backus.  In the deadly ""Chicken Run"", a key gang member dies when his car plunges over a cliff with him in it.  But the other gang members still chase after Jim to make sure he does not confess what he knows to a sympathetic cop (Edward Platt).

Eventually, Jim and Judy and Plato form their own family of three in the abandoned mansion below the observatory.  They make a poignant trio, and the three actors-who all met tragic ends in real life-are unforgettable as they just chat about life, their parents, and why no one understands them.  When the gang members descend on the mansion, followed by the cops, you know things will turn out unhappily.  The ending packs a real wallop, helped by Leonard Rosenman's invisible, but powerful score.  (His score for EAST OF EDEN is towering, one of the 1950's best.)  REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE is a truly great film, one of the real classics of the American cinema.

The letterboxed videocassette I am reviewing has 45 minutes of bonus material-B&W behind-the-scenes TV documentaries with actor/host Gig Young, a jaw-dropping auto safety short (that was banned from TV) with the real James Dean, screen tests, a different and weaker ending, and glimpses of what the movie would have looked like in original B&W before Jack Warner wisely decided to do it all in color.  These bonuses also seem to be on the DVD.

507600,5,6302685141,"I barely knew who James Dean was until a friend of mine recommended ""Rebel Without A Cause."" Now, i believe that James Dean is not only an icon that people (esp. teens) should recognize for his outstanding role as a confused and volatile teen in Rebel, but quite simply a raw human being. He pretty much exemplified the outcry of most teenagers everywhere with this classic line from the film: ""You are tearing me apart!"" Who can't relate to that type of emotion that one feels for their  parents or friends, at times? I was surprised in how i could relate to the characters in the movie, even though they are nothing like me. That's why Rebel Without A Cause is timeless: it speaks for every young generation just as much as it did during Jame Dean's era. Also, everything else about this movie, the way it was made, the plot, the music, etc., just complements every aspect of the film. Of course, James Dean made this film what it is; it's amazing to see his character transform before our eyes, which is a very rare event to witness in a film.

Unfortunately, the three primary characters--- Natalie Wood, James Dean, and Sal Mineo--- all experienced tragic ends. Ironically, just like in the movie, Sal Mineo was murdered, Natalie Wood drowned, and James Dean died in a car crash. All of these people were truly talented actors that i hope will be recognized in this film as well as the others that they were in.",1118361600,3,1416,4.549019607843137

Peter Lawford's 1974 ""James Dean Remembered"" proves to be one of the worst ""chat shows"" in television history, but still has retrospective entertainment value.

Although certainly dated, REBEL still holds up with thematic resonance for contemporary audiences.  Dean is breathtaking.  Mineo is heartbreaking. A must have for your DVD library!",1118361600,,873,5.389705882352941
507602,4,6302685141,"You can read dozens, if not hundreds, of reviews of ""Rebel Without a Cause"" here and elsewhere on the internet. In a nutshell, this is a story about the emerging ""teenager"" in America, post-World War II; troubled, lonely, dangerous and hard to understand. James Dean plays Jim, the new guy in town, the outisder. Even though the cover and movie poster makes him seem dangerous and bad, Jim really isn't like that. He's rather soft, shy, unable to fit in with those his age. Natalie Wood plays the bad girl next door who, like Jim, is misunderstood. Her father turns a cold shoulder to her, leaving her with the only option of acting out in order to get his attention.

What's so different about the ""Special Edition?"" Unlike the original DVD/VHS release a few years back, this one has extras galore. It's released as part of the James Dean collection. So, it has a lot of extra features that focuses on James Dean the actor. It doesn't stop there. It has a near-40 minute long feature from those who produced the movie that explains how it came about and the different aspects and production points. So, in total, you're getting:

*Commentary by Douglas L. Rathgeb: If you've seen the movie, then you can simply click this on in the menu and listen to this author, who wrote a book about the movie a while ago, talk about a lot of behind the scenes, ""did you know...,"" actor and casting secrets behind the movie. He speaks constantly and tells you just about all you'd ever want and need to know about the movie, including where it differs from the book and he even tries to explain some of the plot holes that may hold the movie back.

*Theatrical trailor: The original trailor to the movie. It's rather long, considering it's a trailor, and is basically a montage of scenes from the film, some that may reveal some of the best scenes before they are seen.

~DISC 2~

*""Rebel Without a Cause: Defiant Innocents"" documentary: Long, about 40 minutes. It's informative and again, reveals some things you may not know about the film and answers some questions. I personally found it to drag on a bit and didn't really get interested until the end when they talked about how Dean's death impacted the film.

*""James Dean Remembered"" documentary: This is the best feature, in my opinion, on the disc. This was a documentary filmed 20 years after James Dean's death. Sammy Davis jr., Natalie Wood and numerous others sit down and talk about Dean, as they remembered him. There were anecdotes about James Dean's encounter with Marlon Brando, his alleged homosexual life, his odd behavior, his humor, the way he acted. It includes a lot of scenes from his three films, as well as a few other TV show appearances. This feature is nearly an hour long but had me hooked the minute it began.

* 3 Warner Bros. segments: These are little ""behind the scenes"" bits that feature Natalie Wood, Jim B. (plays the father, perhaps most known for his role as Thurston H. on 'Gilligan's Island'), and James Dean's perhaps famous ""don't drive too fast"" segment he filmed while shooting ""Giant."" These are obviously mostly staged and scripted, but that's how they were done back int he 1950s.

* Additional Scenes without Sound: The good point is that you get more scenes from this film that were cut out. You also get to see a lot more of Natalie Wood and James Dean. The alternate ending is also included (partially at least). There are also over a dozen additional scenes. The bad? There are no sounds. Not even on the color shots. They are all silent, tedious, and many of them weren't really additional scenes, they seemed to be extra footage. Do we really want to watch 8 long scenes of people leaving or hanging around the Planetarium? Or James Dean, who can barely be seen, just gazing up at some big contraption in the Planetarium? Or watch an intense scene like the alternate ending ... without any sound? Or kids driving their cars into the school's parking lot? This was nice, we all love additional scenes, but it was rather pointless.

*Rare Screen Test: Basically, the main three, Wood, Mineo, Dean, as they were in the mansion toward the end of the film. It's okay, I didn't find it that different from what was in the film.

*Wadrobe Tests: The actors are trying on different coats, standing around, trying not to look so stuffy and attempting to be friendly toward one another. It's fun to watch James Dean kid around, but that's just about it from this feature.

As for how the film itself looks, it's great. The transfer, reportedly new, is wonderful. You'll see, in the opening main menu and in features, the original film as it was seen in theaters; blurry, muted colors, dark, gritty. None of that here. It's vivid, intense, modern looking. The soundtrack for the most part is good. I'd say the film is at it's best in this Special Edition format.

So, buy this edition. More features, a better film quality, more bang for the buck. Definately worth your time and attention. Everyone should own this piece of Hollwyood history.",1117497600,6,5026,4.653889515219842
507603,5,6302685141,"Rebel without a Cause showcases the performances of James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo in a classic story of teenagers disconnected from their parents in the mid-1950s.  There are many famous scenes and lines, all discussed in other reviews.

The current 2-disc special edition has excellent picture and sound and has a good set of extra features, including a commentary, featurettes, and making-of shots.

Queer theorists have tried to make something of the relationships of Dean, Mineo, and their characters.  The only mention of this alternative analysis comes in the commentary track, where the suggestion that Plato (Mineo) has a homoerotic attraction to Jim (Dean) is dismissed because the production code would not stand for it and because Plato is more straight-forwardly viewed as wanting Jim to be a big brother or father.  This is the mainstream view.  Those wanting to explore gay interpretations will have to await another release.

Regardless, this film influenced family values and dress standards for years to come and is a must-see.",1117497600,,1054,5.238095238095238
507604,5,6302685141,"""Rebel Without A Cause"" is one of the finest films ever created. The story is about a troubled youth that seeks redemption and a sense security through his family, but when they fail to do that he seeks comfort through friendship. James Dean, Natalie Woods, and the rest of the cast are great in this film, so it's no wonder why this movie is a classic. With great scenes like the chicken run car race or the arguements James has with his parents, you'll never want to turn off the T.V. The direction for this film seemed very powerful and had you in suspense throughout the film. One moment you'll be sad at some of James Dean's struggles in the movie, but then you'll be happy at some of his more happy scenes in the film. I think many of today's youth can identify with Dean's character, so making it that much more of a powerful film. Although the film does seem a bit paced at time, it doesn't ruin the experience. Overall, if you like movies, then you'll love this one.

507607,5,6302685141,"This exceptional movie probably deserves even more of a cult status than it already has. Most people, when they think of RWC, remember it only as one of the few examples we have of James Dean's eerie charisma; but it's also an entertaining and powerful film, well written and acted, and the credit for the lasting impression of Dean's character should go as much to the filmmakers as to Dean himself (not that Dean himself doesn't deserve bales and bales of credit).

Today, a lot of elements of RWC might seem obvious; the generational gap in more apparent now than ever, and the attemps of children to compensate for a lack of parental attention has been a common theme for decades. Not only, though, should you consider that the film was groundbreaking when it was released, but what it has to _say_ about the issues between children and their parents is more relevant today than ever. The script deserves credit mainly for a couple of reasons:

1) The film doesn't have that 'made by kids' feel that's afflicted a lot of more recent movies about kids, such as Better Luck Tomorrow. It has a definite sense of perspective, as in the scene where Jim's father tells him: 'I'm trying to show you how foolish you are!--Ten years from now, this won't mean anything; you'll look back on it and laugh!' In a way, he's right, but that doesn't make Jim's feelings or the problems facing him any less urgent at the moment.

2) The kids in RWC are smart, and they have personalities beyond basic love-starved psychosis. Buzz, especially, is a surprisingly fully-drawn character, and some of Dean's best moments as Jim come when he's doing innocent things, like jumping up behind the fence to get Judy's attention. Finally, the scene in which Jim, Judy and Plato parody adult behavior is especially incisive and especially relevant today - kids are, in many ways, shrewder than they're given credit for, and their eyes are open.

3) There are moments of overacting (Jim shouting: ""You're tearing me apart!""), but there's understatement too. At the beginning, for example, after Jim's father complains that he's bought everything for his son, and the audience is ready to write him off as ignorant and materialistic, he immediatley adds that he's shown Jim love and affection too - which may not be entirely true, but he's shown as being more than just a stock Bad Parent.

4) Things like 'no stab' knife fights and racing with stolen cars might seem almost tame by modern standards, but the display of self-destructive behavior in RWC still has some emotional power. The kids may doing things which kids today would consider silly, but their attitudes are sometimes genuinely frightening. Again Buzz is a great character. The gang mentality, too, with its shifting attitudes and its effect on personality, is very striking and very accurate.

In an era when parents seem to be trying harder than ever to understand their children, the problems have really remained the same. The consequences today might be more severe, but psychology and the human thrist for love are timeless, and RWC may well be timeless. In fact, beyond still being relevant, the film is an effective antidote to modern films which glorify and enshrine adolescent problems, when many of these things are just as pathetic, in the end, as a boy whose socks don't match.",1102204800,7,3329,4.831578947368421

507630,5,6302685141,"Certain scenes of this 1950s blockbuster may look corny now, but the film revolutionized the industry in its day.  ""Rebel Without a Cause"" put the concept of the film-aimed-at-teenagers into high gear -- a trend that is still going today.  We have this film to thank for the likes of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" and the millions of other movies that come out now specially designed to appeal to teenagers.  The film is also basically the everlasting showcase for James Dean's talent.

Dean is exceptional in the movie (he only made three during his lifetime, two of which were released after his death), playing a high school youth named Jim Stark who is trying to fit in while other teens are making sure he stays out.  The film cannot be watched as anything but a stage for Dean's method acting (revolutionary and progressive in its own right in the mid 1950s).  Particularly poignant is a scene about teenage drag-racing, as Dean himself would die in a car accident shortly after the filming of that scene.

""Rebel Without a Cause"" is, many would argue, Dean's ""finest hour.""  There are a handful of films that are regarded as classics of ""Old Hollywood,"" and this is consistently near the top of the list.  It speaks on multiple levels, and is considered a ""classic"" for good reason.",1096588800,,1313,4.748898678414097

On his first day, Jim alienates a gang of boys, gets a girlfriend  (Natalie Wood), befriends a neurotic outcast (Sal Mineo), and takes part in a ""chicky-run"" over a cliff.

Every minute of this film has become beloved by its fans, thanks to Dean, who owned the screen in his famous white tee shirt, red jacket, and jeans. 50s teens thought Dean spoke for them and they idolized him.  He still deserves his icon status, because of the unforgettable character he created.  When he cried to his parents, ""You're tearing me apart!"" you believed it was real.  He was the epitome of the cool rebel.

Almost fifty years later, the character created by James Dean still rings true. They say a thing of beauty is a joy forever. That applies both to James Dean and this movie.  A must-see classic film.

507633,5,6302685141,"For all that the title is such a classic one, it is rather inaccurate. And possibly, it was meant to be. Maybe a catchy title to draw in the crowds or a deliberate lie to show later that their cause, seeming meaningless, was a valid one. And in the end, this film is so poignant! Not a ""dated"" film at all, but a lesson to the generations of teenagers before and afterwards. Teenage angst has not changed in the last 50 years, and the reasons have not become any less meaningful. ""Rebel Without a Cause"" offers a very truthful look into the lives of teenagers, the reasons they rebel and gives a reason to why rebeliousness should not be taken so lightly.

The movie begins with all three of the main characters Jim (James Dean) Judy (Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo) in a police station in the wee hours of the morning. All are dressed in obviously middle and upper-class clothes but have been picked up on the street for wandering, drunkeness and violence. The title of the movie immediately gives itself away, Judy is upset because her father was rough with her, Plato's father left him and his mother is never at home...

Then we meet Jim's parents. A submissive father, sharp-tongued mother and uptight grandmother. True, they may give him ""many things"" but the tension, strain and ignorance of Jim's needs are, as he says, ""tearing me apart!""

We find out in the course of the movie, as Jim, Judy and Plato come together, that they are really good kids who are only looking for love and acceptance. We see how little their parents understand of them and how they are rebelling against the ignorance that has been starving them for years!

And truly, this is my FAVORITE James Dean movie, I think his portrayal of Jim is really a mirror of his own life with his biological Dad and some of the kids he grew up with. His acting is just so true, real, passionate and believable. This movie is my reasoning for why he is still such a legend. Truly, one of the greatest actors of all time. And a fantastic movie to boot!

And get this, the extra disc has all kinds of wonderful things the VHS tape had.  Cast interviews, screen tests, alternate endings, black and white clips, film changes!

507634,5,6302685141,"Quite possibly the greatest movie of all ""rebel without a cause"" is regarded as one  of the best movies ever made, like ""cool hand luke"" it has had a cultural impact, not
only as far as movie as concerned but society.
what made the movie such a hit was the fact that you had this giant rebel icon  known as james dean, whom every young girl wanted to go out. an all star cast such as natalie wood, whose career would continue to skyrocket with such great films as ""splendor in the grass"". however, the film's storyline is what impacted viewers, much of which were young men and women who could relate to the main character. dean plays jim stark, born to a rich father , stark don't seem to fit in with anybody, his neighboorhood, his classmates, he movesto a new town where he must try to fit with society. he encounters on his first day judy (wood), a pretty girl whose around with the wrong crowd, a rebellious gang bent on no good. as jim gets lost finding his class he meets a kind young man named plato (sal mineo who also died young) who helps him find his way. however near the end of the afternoon jim has a confrontation with judy'sboyfriend named buzz (played by corey allen) what results is a fatal accident. however besides this stark must deal with his overbearing father who does not understand his own and thinks he can soothe him by buying him literally. it seems that stark cannot fit into anywhere in society, he is a rebel,an outsider looking in on a world, that doesn't quite understand him and it will be a battle for him to find his way and find meaning in his life.
that's the cult phenomen right there, everyone especially teenagers feel at one time or another like jim stark, a rebel, an outsider looking in, not really acceptedinto any form of society whether it's school or his own parents. stark is the classic example of the rebel. of course jim stark's character is totally identical to James Dean himself, who lived life by the edge. Just like Jim Stark, Dean didn't getalong with his father, in fact his father didn't want Dean to go into acting. Imagine if James Dean followed his father's stupid advice? Incredible, this idol would never have been born. He had a strange relationship with his mother. He played the Stark character like his own because it was his story.
The acting by Dean's costars is equally as good Jim Backus as Frank Stark plays Jim's dad. Backus is best known for playing Mr. Howell on Gilligan's Island. Backus brings a lot of ""Mr. Howell"" into this character. His rich ideals and manner are completely blind to the trails and turbulations his son is going through leading to the famous ""Your tearing me apart"" line by James Dean, one of the most memorable lines in movie history. Natalie Wood is excellent as Judy, the popular and pretty girl at school who realizes near the end of the film that she is a lost soul like Stark. Sal Mineo is great as Plato the rich kid with the somewhat pessimistic look on society. Plato when hemeets Stark, start a very quaint relationship, although part of it lies in the fact that Plato is completely fascinated by Stark.
DVD details
Ah it's been over 50 years since the movie has been released but only until a couple of years ago, a dvd was released, however it's worth the wait as dvd comes with many great extras and historical pieces of rare footage.  First is the rare trailer for the movie, however as an added bonus we get trailers for James Dean's other flick including Giant (with Rock Hudson) and East of Eden (his last film).
3 Documentaries on the film including one called ""Rediscovering a Rebel"" which reveals interesting details about the movie. For instance the movie was actually at first f ilmed in black and white as seen in the screen test forDean and Wood. The executives at Warner Bros. decided to go color as color was now becoming the standard in films.  Also you get ultra rare screen tests with Dean and Wood acting out their roles. However
, we also get what's best described as a propangand interview for the stars themselves  from Warner Bros. We get a long and rare interview with star Natalie Wood as she catches some rest and explains the film itself. We also get a rare interview with Dean himself.
Then we get an inside look into Warner Bros. other features at the time including
East of Eden (Dean's last film).
The documentaries are excellent as they provide rare footage coupled with many facts  about the movie almost no one knows about. For instance the Jim Stark
character modeled after James Dean was actually supposed to be a kind of nerd.  When James Dean tried for roles he often sported a pair of reading glass.  He later changed his image to appear more suave and cool. It obviously worked.
One part of the documentary has Dean sporting a public service message for safe
driving which is a sad twist of fate since Dean died in a car crash.
As you can see this is a must have DVD complementing one of the greatest movies of all time. People talk about ""Casablanca"" and all this other classics, but in my opinions, ""Rebel Without A Cause"" overshadows them as it's a movie which reach a million or so teens in it's day and still has the power to do that today with it's messages of alienation, the outsider and not fitting in, while trying to find oneself's true identity.

James Dean delivers a knock-out performance, as Jim Stark. It's his first day at a new high school. Only, this time, he wants to do things the right way: A troubled past, his parents avoid problems by simply moving. On this day, Jim truly wants things to be different for good. The night before wasn't great!. Arrested for public intoxication, his parents, perhaps the first glimpse of a ""dysfunctional"" family on screen, hardly know how to handle the situation: Mom is overbearing, self-centered and constantly ruling over anything his father has to say. His dad is a lilly-livered man with good intentions, but Jim needs guidance. He begs for it, in his rebellion. At the police station, among the other teens in trouble, isJudy (played by the gorgeous, Natalie Wood). Judy has similar problems with her parents. Her father actually slapped her for kissing him on the cheek! All Judy wants is to feel loved. Also at the jail, is John ""Plato"", played to perfection by Sal Mineo (Nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor). When we first meet Plato, he is being questioned why he shot a bunch of puppies, a horrifying way to introduce a character, but somehow, Mineo makes us care about Plato, a rich kid with tons of problems: His dad disappeared, and his mom is always away on trips, leaving him to be cared for by the family maid. Plato is looking for somebody to be his friend, or family. And by the end of 24 hours, these 3 will make their own tightly knit little circle. After a rough start in school, Jim finds trouble during a field trip at ""Griffith Park Observatory"" with a bunch of rough kids, including Judy, who runs with the wrong crowd. Jim meets Plato at the Observatory, who warns him not to ""monkey with"" them. But, the kids are dead-set on causing Jim trouble, and before we know it, Buzz, the leader of the gang, forces Jim into a knife-fight.. Jim, Judy, and Plato form a kind of ""family"",(and it's obvious Plato has a crush on Jimmy,possiby the first gay teen in cinema history) and end up hiding out at a deserted mansion near the Observatory, as the gang searches for them, as well as the police. In Jim, Judy finds a young man who she can truly love...And Plato finds a buddy he always has wished for.. ..The performances are so gut wrenching, and real, you cannot help but feel their pain.. .When Plato screams out, ""save me"" holding a gun, as the gang closes in, you cannot help but feel his pain. These 3 not only make you care for them, but you can almost ""feel"" their agony. ""Rebel"" is not just the tale of teens trying to fit-in. It is also about friendship.. it's about loyalty.. integrity, and the basic need to feel loved. That is what makes this movie so potent. That is why generation after generation have discovered, and embraced ""Rebel"". Times have changed, but human emotions haven't: We all long for human interaction, and companionship. And for 24 hours, at least, this family of 3 found it. We should all be so lucky.",1076112000,5,3397,4.5688524590163935
507637,5,6302685141,"Released soon after James Dean's death, in the same year in which East of Eden also appeared, this film immediately attracted and rewarded great interest and has continued to do so. Part of its appeal is explained by the fact that Dean died instantaneously in a violent car crash, Natalie Wood drowned, Sal Mineo was stabbed to death, and Nick Adams overdosed on prescription drugs. Their premature deaths enrich even more the poignancy of their roles as teenage rebels ""without a cause."" Actually, much of their behavior is explained by their unhappiness in their dysfunctional families. Jim Stark (Dean) feels smothered by his parents who move from one town to another, hoping that he will finally ""find himself."" Judy Hopper (Wood) desperately needs love from a father (William Hopper) who is unwilling and/or unable to provide it. Plato (Mineo) seems to have no contact whatsoever with his parents. Meanwhile, Judy eagerly agrees to be gang leader Buzz Gunderson's ""trophy girlfriend."" After his death, she shifts her attention to Jim. They and Plato briefly become a ""family of three,"" in one scene in an abandoned mansion even pretending (albeit satirically) to be father, mother, and son. (FYI, the set in which this scene was shot is alleged to have appeared earlier in Sunset Boulevard as Norma Desmond's mansion.) All of the film's action occurs within a 24-hour time period, beginning in a police station and ending with police also involved because....

Nicholas Ray directed Rebel Without a Cause and also co-authored the script. Working with an exceptionally talented cast, he succeeded so well with evoking great performances from that cast that Dean, Wood, and Mineo have since become icons for teenage malaise. They brood, they pout, they withdraw, they whine, they whimper, while feeling totally misunderstood by adults. They especially resent their parents' inability to ""get it"" even without knowing what that ""it"" is.

I saw this film again recently, again impressed by the quality of the acting but, probably inevitably, much of the film now seems dated to me even as it retains much of its innocence. Some scenes remain quite vivid, such as when Judy stands proudly out in the field, bathed in automobile headlights, before ""officially"" starting the ""Chickie Run"" contest; also when Jim urges his Mitty-like father (Jim Backus) to stand up to his (Mr. Stark's) badger-like wife (Ann Doran). It is probably not realistic to expect young people in relatively comfortable circumstances to have a ""cause"" except to be accepted, respected, and loved on their own terms. This is a ""classic"" of sorts. When seeing it now, I have the feeling that I have opened a time capsule from 1955 and the film is among the items contained in it.",1075852800,45,2749,5.052863436123348

  But there is a review from someone in Illinois, that obviously did not pay attention to the movie. They comment on the fact that Judy does not grieve the loss of Buzz, Duh! Thats the point, the feeling of isolated youth and the confusion that youth brings. Judy has lost someone so close to her and yet she is not able to cry for him or even show any signs of loss, (Kinda deep huh?)
  This same reviewer pointed out that all the actors in the movie overact, What movie were you watching? With all the fake soap opera type acting we see in todays cinema the acting in Rebel seems low key given the circumstances.
  Another fact pointed out was the script and lack of quality it showed. Sorry, But I'm gonna have to disagree with you. The script was a combination of other ideas and I feel it has important structure and symbolism that is sometimes missed by the less intelligent viewer.
  As for the character played by Sal Mineo, we know from the opening scene that he is a powder keg. He blew away a bunch of helpless puppies because he was upset and distraught. He felt abandoned by Jim and Judy (Just like his mother and father!) and those same feelings made him feel like killing something or someone else. Totally believable.

507668,5,6302685141,"Someone called this movie ""The Quintessential American Film"". Such hyperbole is not far off the mark. Only in America could the hapless lives of a bunch of spoiled brats be turned into fodder for a mannered story of hand-wringing teenage existential angst. Elsewhere, teenagers are too busily engaged in the business of living and surviving to indulge in the navel gazing so blithely practiced by the young people in this film.
I don't mean to say that this is a bad film. It is a great film, a classic film, but for reasons the very antithesis of those cited by its admirers. It is great because it exposes everything that is wrong with American youth: the self-centredness, the self-pity, the lack of self-motivation, the blaming-everyone-but-themselves mindset. It's all there, for those honest enough to see it; and it's all encapsulated in a bunch of misfits so full of themselves that they cannot see beyond the confines of their own paltry little universes.
A lot has been written over the years about James Dean's performance. But whether or not he or Natalie Wood or Sal Mineo overplayed their roles is beside the point. What is important is that they effectively conveyed the emptiness in the lives of suburban youth. This film is not a classic because it made Dean an icon, or because his real death would soon immortalize his fictional character, but because of the skill with which insignificant lives were vested with seeming significance. In many ways, this film can be considered the progenitor of the grunge realism school of cinema, a school that persists to the present day and has spawned the pretentious art house films that infest university campuses all over the world.
This film could only exist in a world where affluence is so commonplace that it is taken for granted, where life is so self-centred that aimlessness can be elevated to the status of tragedy, and where thrills are so cheap that the jaded can only feel alive by promoting risks that take them to the edge of death. This film gave rise to innumerable games of chicken, knife fight scenes and squint eyed antiheroes mumbling nihilistic doggerel, but it has also suffered from being considered nothing more than the sum of such stylistic devices. In reality, it is an unwitting indictment of American youth, and viewed as such, it achieves a significance that is wholly unintentional.",1069200000,3,2372,4.902985074626866

(USA - 1955)

Aspect ratio: 2.55:1 (CinemaScope)
Theatrical soundtrack: 4-track stereo

A troubled teenager (James Dean) struggles to find his place in a new school, where he falls in love with a fellow student (Natalie Wood) and is forced into a confrontation with her bullying boyfriend (Corey Allen), leading to unexpected tragedy...

Nicholas Ray's quintessential Fifties melodrama signalled a sea-change in American cinema, which saw the glossy fantasies made popular during wartime gradually replaced by tougher subjects and a realistic depiction of contemporary society. Stewart Stern's coy script may seem a little dated now, but the drama is still potent enough to resonate with modern audiences, and there's a wealth of surprising subtexts, including Natalie Wood's impressive turn as an immature teenager who feels rejected by her father (William Hopper) because he refuses to indulge the kind of affections he lavished on her as a child, and Sal Mineo as the brittle interloper who keeps a picture of Alan Ladd in his school locker and develops an obvious crush on the dazzling new boy, played by Dean. A formidable young talent, Dean's signature red jacket affords him a visual prominence denied most of his fellow actors, and he judges the emotional honesty of each sequence with uncanny precision.

Director Ray uses the CinemaScope frame in a wholly expressive manner, dividing his characters across the length and breadth of the wide screen and tilting the image at crucial dramatic moments. However, despite powerful performances by a strong supporting cast (including Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Edward Platt and Dennis Hopper), a 'daring' screenplay and A-list production values, the film's many virtues have been slightly overshadowed by Dean's tragic early death and subsequent iconic status within American culture.",1062633600,2,1856,5.408304498269896

507672,5,6302685141,"It comes very far and few where a movie is as good as its novel or sometimes even better, ""East of Eden"" is one of those movies. All though the film takes place where the novel would be 3/4 done, the film incudes a lot that the novel doesn't. The film starts with that intense music at first, then as the credits go on, it becomes more soothing. After the credits, the film cuts to the chase, it has Cal (James Dean in his film debute) following his suspected mother, Kate (Jo Van Fleet in her oscar winning role), in those first twentie minutes of the film, we are set to think that Cal is a stalker, then as the film goes on to when Cal starts working for his dad (Raymond Massey) we still don't understand him, but we are also no longer afraid of him. And as the film goes on some more we come to like Cal a lot. Soon we see him kissing his brothers girl (Julie Harris), it is like a casual on screen love affair. Not fifteen minutes after that part we grow sorry for Cal. Then after we have come all of this way to respect and love Cal, he becomes decieving, as if it were the temtations of the devil. IT was brilliant that all of these great moments had been cought on camera, it was Dean acting out his lifes story and it was so breath taking how we were there to see it. Over the years ""East of Eden"" had became a classic, it remained unforgettable. However Warner Brose. has not recognized the magic ""East of Eden"" had brought, so they had stopped print on it over the years. As the film is tapes is groweing old and we see that film deteriorating, we are now only seeing half the magic that ""East of Eden"" could bring to us, and it has also been a long time since the film was seen in the widescreen format, if only it had been released, people would finally capter that magic that ""East of eden"" had brought to the world forty-seven years ago. ""East of Eden"" still moves and disturbs us with that centrolle image of seeing all that is good and all that is bad in one human being.",1050364800,2,1989,4.142118863049095
507673,4,6302685141,"Prior to ""Rebel Without a Cause"" there was no such thing as a ""teen flick"" (a film targeted at a teen audience).  There were films for adults and films for adults and children, and then there were kiddie pictures.  ""Rebel"" broke the mold and nothing's been the same ever again.
""Rebel"" was released after Dean's death, but is probably the most popular of his three films.  It is certainly the most accessible and appreciable for even today's youth.
Brando had made ""The Wild Ones,"" but Dean's ""Rebel..."" was far better received.  It is the story of ""a day in the life...of a teenager"" and that is what makes it so great!
The story and the action in this film revolve around Dean's character - Jim Stark - a new kid in a new high school, just trying to fit in.  His first day he runs into Plato (Sal Mineo), the school nerd, and befriends him.  He falls for Judy (Natalie Wood), the girlfriend of the school tough guy.  In the course of this one day, he is forced to prove his worth and his manhood to not only his new classmates, but to his father and mother and the local police,  as well.
Some of the most riveting scenes are:  the planetarium and when Jim, Judy, and Plato visit the old empty house.  In the planetarium we see poor Plato amazed with the confidence and bravado that Jim shows, not knowing that Jim is terrified of not fitting in and that he is grasping for position.  In the abandoned house we see Jim take his position, if only for a moment in time, as husband to Judy and father to Plato.  For as much as Judy has fallen for Jim, it is Plato who has truly fallen for Jim.  It is Plato's realization that his position as outcast can never be altered because of who and what he is. It is this realization that ultimately brings about the film's tragic ending.
Today, Hollywood, it seems, has a factory that produces films only for teen audiences and they have forgotten the adults.  When ""Rebel"" was made, it was done so with an eye for adults and young adults alike.  In doing so, the film doesn't insult the viewer - regardless of age.  It also proves that drama, even for a young audience, needn't have nudity, four letter words, or blatant sex in order to tell a good story.

I remember the hubub about the TV miniseries in the early 80s, and I guess that planted the impression on my young mind that it's a trashy sudser akin to Harold Robbins (what else was I to think from all those ""parental guidance"" warnings?).  And now 20 years after that, I'm surprised that I have hardly seen anything written about this original version in all the books and articles I have read on movies.  Because it is so GREAT!  I was socked in the gut by this one.
It is not easy for films to move me on a deep level, but this one sure did.  It was the first time in quite a while that a movie made me really cry and feel it.  The scene where James Dean finally tries to buy his father's love--though thinking it's the right thing to do--and realizes his futility, is stunning.  He becomes so overwhelmed with pain that he even tries to hug his father.  It's one of the most wrenching moments ever captured on film.  This moment is so great and so powerful that if it doesn't get to the core of one's being, then I don't know what will.  That brilliant cinematic moment then leads to a series of extraordinary events that makes for dynamite suspense and storytelling (no I haven't read the book yet).
But aside from the cinematic brilliance of ""East Of Eden"" (the extraordinay cast, namely Mr. James Dean, whose legend now makes complete sense after seeing this; the set pieces, the script, the direction), it ultimately is a heartwrenching look at our most primal need in human life:  a desperate, innate need for our parents' love.

  From the comedy, when Jim and Judy are acting like a married couple and talking about kids, to the action, when Jim's in the knife fight and and car race, to the drama, when Plato gets shot, and Jim has his only friend left, Judy, at his side, it is both written and acted wonderfully!

Jim is forced to defend himself, first in a knife fight with the gang leader Buzz, then in a ""chickie run"".  When Buzz is accidentally killed, the gang blames Jim.  On the run from both the gang and the law, Jim forms a family of sorts with Buzz's girl Judy, and a sensitive introverted boy named Plato (what a name!).
""Rebel Without a Cause"" was quite popular during the fifties and for decades after that.  It was a youth oriented film that delt with kids on their own terms when most films were still marketed at adults.  It addressed the growing youthful unrest in the Eisenhower era, superficially a happy decade.  It also had James Dean in his signature role.  This, combined with Dean's death in a car accident one month before this film's release would transform him into a teenage icon.
Good though it is, I have a few complaints.  For one thing, why does the film assume that if a kid falls into gangs or crime that the parents are responsible?  That doesn't seem right to me.  For that matter, the ""bad parenting"" shown seems pretty mild to me.  Judy falls into a gang because her father doesn't show her as much affection as he should.  Jim gets drunk simply because he is annoyed by his father's unmanly habbit of wearing an apron and making his wife dinner in bed.  Couldn't the filmmakers have thought up anything better than that?  Why not have some of the kids come from a broken or abusive home?
Probably the weakest part of the film is at the beginning where the three main characters find themselves at juvenile hall.  Surely police officers have better things to do than pick up teens on minor offences.  And three teens in one night?  Jim's offence is being drunk, Judy's is walking outside after curfew (a curfew?!?).
Fortunately, the good outways the bad.  Nicholas Ray gets great performances from his youthful cast.  Ray's direction is superb.

His troubles all stem from a lack of communication with his folks. He finally finds himself friends with Plato and Judy, but still becomes involved when a leather-jacket clad gang comes after Plato, in which he is eventually shot in the end.

507722,5,6302685141,"Many people don't realize when they are watching this film that, like On the Waterfront, they are watching a semi-autobiographical story about director Elia Kazan.
Allow me to explain.  East of Eden tells the story of a boy named Cal Trask and his attempts to win the love of his father Adam Trask.  Adam prefers his other son Aaron, the ""good"" son over Cal the ""bad"" son.  The names Cal and Aaron obviously bring to mind Cain and Abel from the Bible.  Adding  to the emotional fireworks, Cal finds himself increasingly attracted to Aaron's fiancee Abra.  Cal's attempts to win the love and approval of everyone around him are frustrated at every turn as everyone considers him bad.  The film is set in Salinas, California in 1917 as America is about to enter the First World War.
Kazan grew up in the company of a disapproving father who never missed the opportunity to remind him that he preferred his siblings.  His nickname for Kazan: Good-for-nothing.  Later in Hollywood, Kazan would famously cooperate with HUAC in their horrific witch hunt.  This earned him the disapproval and outrage of many other filmmakers who never forgave Kazan for his appalling acts.
Thus it was not a coincidence that East of Eden was made in the years following Kazan's HUAC testimony.  Nor is it a coincidence that Kazan chose to focus on the Cain character when he adapted John Steinbeck's enormous novel.  Kazan made a moving and poetic film about an ostrasized and misunderstood young man struggling against what he believes to be his innate nature.
The neurotic James Dean (in his first starring role), was ideally cast as Kazan's alter ego.  The film's lush colour photography and beautiful Leonard Rosenman score add to the emotional charge.

The rest of the cast are ticklishly super also, Julie Harris gets Abra just right, the scene in the field with Cal ripples through me every time she does that little giggle, hoo im ripply now........ still ripply but i shall go on to tell you Jo van Fleet as Kate is nastier than that woman down my street that eats cats ( eats=keeps ). I read one review that stated her performance wasn't in-keeping with the books because she shows her good side, Im sure while reading i also discovered Kates humanity, so i hope the person who thought that gets eaten like a cat. Raymond Massey and his stiff acting could seem out of place but fits into the scenes with Cal perfectly, truly inspired casting...
Kazans direction is top-notch as usual, I especially like the scene with Cal on the swing and the one with Cal and Abra under the tree, they is mighty purtty scenes.
The screenplay is adapted really well consdiring the weight of the message present in the novel, the idea of personal choice is pressed throughout sucsessfulllyyy (cant remember how many l's or y's)
In summary this is a pretty little film that makes me lick the screen in excitment.",1019088000,3,1923,4.389355742296919
507752,5,6302685141,"The fact that Rebel can have such a profound effect on myself almost half a century after its creation is a testement to its greatness and proves its status as a classic piece of cinema. Its message is ageless and is almost saddening to think that after all this time the issues relevent in the film have yet to be socially adressed, adults still don't emote with their kids, and kids still have trouble fitting in to the pecking order laid down by our supposed betters. Despite being made nearly 50 years before i graced this good earth and set in a completely alien setting to my own the beat that runs through this film caught me in its rythm and Ive never danced the same again. Anyone who ever felt like dropping their pants and screaming just to be heard, be it by a parent, boss or government official should see this film.
James Dean in Rebel creates one of the greatest roles ever brought to screen, Jim is the rebel that we want to be and also the sensetive tourtured soul we all are, he embodies the characteristics of everyone who watches, one of the only characters in film who is truely polysemic ( only Brando as Terry Malloy in On the waterfront comes to mind as another example) James Dean is a hero for all, we each take a different part of his character and relate it to our own struggles.
The film has a timeless message and although set in the 50s only the dress and the 50s terminology reveal its age, this in no way detracts from the film though, because as with Shakespeare and other such timeless media, the emotional nerve is still as sensetive as it was then, and personally i feel the setting causes a modern audience to relate the text more closely to themselves, creating the question this was how it was for them, how is it now for you?
Anyone farmiliar with my reviews will know this isn't my usual style of writing, but when something speaks to me as Rebel does I have no time for humerous scribings, A film of this callibure demands my full respect and your full attention, if you have not seen it go see it, if you have seen it watch it again and try and learn a little bit more from it.",1018828800,2,2122,4.320802005012531
507753,5,6302685141,"A phenom like James Dean comes along once in a generation; we will be fortunate to see his like again in our lifetime.  He was, purely and simply, a natural.  And in his second movie, ""Rebel Without a Cause"", he showed clearly what he had hinted at in ""East Of Eden"", a stroke of genius.  ""Rebel"" is the great picture it is mainly because Dean is in it.  Dean doesn't play Jim Stark, he IS Jim Stark.  He brings to vivid reality all the confusion and anguish of a 17 year old who doesn't know who he is or where he's headed; we see his love for both his parents struggling with his resentment against his overbearing mother and his contempt for his henpecked father; and his bewilderment at participating in the ""chicken run"" even while he accepts its inevitability (""Why are we doing this?"" he asks Buzz, the delinquent gang leader played by Corey Allen; ""I dunno; we gotta do something"", Buzz answers, as confused and fatalistic as Jim).  In that exchange lies the film in a nutshell.  Why do these kids indulge in anti-social behavior that risks their lives?  Because there's nothing else in their lives that has any real meaning.  In these youngsters we see all the vapid emptiness of 1950's suburbia.  This is what made this 1955 movie so compelling, and so disturbing, to its audience when it opened -- these weren't aliens from the slums of the big cities; these were the kids next door.
""Rebel"" is also the movie that made household names of Dean's two co-stars, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo.  Wood plays Judy, a vibrant, popular teenager living with her uptight parents and her younger brother.  Judy's father is distant and withdrawn from her; and the more Judy, who loves her father more than anything in the world, reaches out to him, the more he repulses her.  What Judy can't understand, but what we can see, is that her growing sexuality is profoundly disturbing to her father; he's attracted and repelled at the same time, and he reacts by pushing her away.  Judy reacts to his rejection by running away and staying out all night, which alienates him further.  At least Judy has parents at home.  Plato, brilliantly acted by Sal Mineo, has nobody but the housekeeper.  His parents are off in Europe somewhere; they can't be bothered with him, and when Plato finally receives a long-awaited envelope from his father, he eagerly tears it open only to find a check enclosed, without a word of ""hi"" or ""how are you"".  Plato is far more lost than Jim or Judy, and at the movie's conclusion, we realize that the denouement was inevitable.  Almost too late, Jim's parents begin to understand their son; whether or not Judy and her father will reach a similar rapprochement is unknown...",1017014400,3,2693,4.643459915611814

507757,4,6302685141,"...As for ""Rebel Without a Cause"", people today who expect to smirk through a hopelessly outdated ""problem picture"" have a surprise in store. Granted, the high school students smoke nothing but cigarettes and their language is necessarily antiseptic (the Hays Code was still in force), but the movie has a tough, angst-ridden quality that should appeal even to today's young generation. Most of this is due to James Dean,who was without a doubt before his time. He captures his character Jim Stark in the opening shot (behind the credits) when he literally stumbles across a toy monkey and, covering it carefully with a scrap of paper, curls up beside it in the fetal position. In the following police precinct sequence when he drunkenly hums ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" (a reference to his mother and grandmother?) or furiously pummels a desk, he vitalizes the screen in a manner few actors have before or since. His supporting players Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo (who really were teenagers -- Dean was in his early twenties) would probably not have left such a strong impression had they not been working with such an impetus. Natalie Wood is Judy, the confused girl next door: her father is obviously having difficulty dealing with her increased nubility. Sal Mineo's Plato is a nervous, potentially violent boy whose feelings for Jim Stark may or may not be filial. Plato's sexual orientation is never explored; but he keeps a picture of Alan Ladd in his locker, and when punks steal his address book they find only boys' names listed. Evidently the remarkable thing about this story for contemporary audiences was that all the despair and dysfunction was not taking place in the slums but in the whitewashed all-WASP suburbs. The high school student body (which includes Corey Allen, Nick Adams, and a squeaky-clean Dennis Hopper) has not a single black person. The implication is of affluence without honest affection, which of course became a ""troubled youth"" clich&eacute;; and, despite Nicholas Ray's hip direction, ""Rebel Without a Cause"" without James Dean would be just another such clich&eacute; It's Dean's sensational presence that makes this a classic picture, one that has as much punch today as when it was first released.",997315200,9,2239,5.037735849056604
507758,4,6302685141,"This is one of those films that has achieved legendary status that everyone should see.  Starring Fifties film icon James Dean, it tells the story of several young people (Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, etc) who don't fit into their families or what society considers acceptable behaviour.  It was one of the first films to deal with alienated youth, and although elements of it are dated and very much a part of Fifties culture, it still maintains its power and appeal.  Of course, a great deal of that power and appeal comes from Dean's most famous and defining performance.  He brings so much raw energy and emotion to his character, and he has a screen presence that is so unique you can understand why he continues to be such a larger than life figure in film, even with only three starring roles to his credit.  Wood and Mineo also contribute memorable performances,  but it really is Dean's show.  Rarely have actor and role been so closely matched and inexorably linked.  It's the stuff of legends.",995414400,5,1006,4.708571428571428
507759,5,6302685141,"His performance may have been hotter in East of Eden, but here James Dean defines the meaning of cool for generations of bewildered teenagers. Never mind the sops to convention that compromise the film's ultimate force. Instead it's there on screen, in the Dean persona, the hesitant gesture, the understanding smile, and a sensitivity that at times becomes achingly, painfully real. Dean didn't play Jim Stark, he was Jim Stark. How fortunate that this avatar of teenage angst was paired with director Nicholas Ray, the patron saint of 50's youth. Together they lift the material to classic heights, such that a bust of Dean now appears at Griffith Observatory (the site of the knife fight) in Los Angeles. Times may have changed, and the film may have dated, but the central performance remains trans-generational, as Dean taps into a universal core. (For the sociologically curious wishing to measure the country's thirty-year loss of innocence, compare this film with the youth-based 1987 film River's Edge. The parallels and contrasts are revealing.)",994896000,2,1055,5.211764705882353
507800,4,6302685141,"James Dean has been made into an icon, a ghost, a symbol of rebellion and angst.  What gets lost in all of this star-worship, is that Dean was not only a man, but a truly talented actor, worthy of all the acolades that were given him during the brief span of his life.  All of this is exemplified in the gem that is, East of Eden.  Must be seen, and reckoned with.  Truly a performance that rises above the flaws of the material.  Timeless.",994291200,2,440,4.190476190476191
507801,5,6302685141,"In this film James Dean is quite convincing as an actor and his part is perfect. A difficult part in that trinity of J, Jim (for James), Judy and John, in one letter Jesus three times and one of the three will have to be sacrificed, crucified in a way, falling right upon a random police bullet when unarmed.

Just such a concentrate of the film shows how ridiculous the world was in 1955. The war was over and the horror of before, during and after was so bleak that the whole world was stoned into full paralytic dullness by the holocaust, the genocide, the fifty million victims and the huge destruction of goods and infrastructures but also of morals and ethics and plain human decency. No surprise that John had Plato as a middle name. The philosophy we could have then was nothing but the good thinking of an elite in a society where 80% of the people were slaves, like in Athens.

In a world like that what is left for the young?

The question is actually slightly premature in a way since these high school teenagers in the early 1950s had experienced the war. They had the horror of the end of that war and they had nothing to thrill them into believing there was some kind of future worth living. No allusion is done to it but there is nothing but the Cold War to enthuse these young people. With that kind of perspective there is not much any one can do to motivate them. We can even wonder if the world exists for these young people in this film.

The parents are dead war heroes, or plain absent. They can also be neurotic and paranoid survivors who want to do things differently and well and do not see that either they run away from what these young people want, or they just ignore what they want, or they just leave them to their own means and to die playing some chicken dare over a cliff. The world is unable to provide these young people with the two things they want: love and a cause they could commit their lives to.

And they will get none.

The school system will go on harping on stars and constellations and will not see that some bullies are imposing their norms to everyone and that those these bullies decide to victimize will have to survive the death of their bullying challengers or die. What a beautiful perspective. Death in both cases. And they do nothing about it, the teachers and the guidance counsellors, and it is still going on. The pedagogical masters who are in fact monstrous monstrosities are just ignoring their very mission which is to build in all the young people they are entrusted with an idealistic vision of the future that makes them ready to work with everyone as equals and to respect everyone else in all their parameters and personalities. The school system has drastically been failing since 1945.

The police is not better since they can only brandish weapons and shoot first. Nothing has changed there either since 1945. They do not wait for the presumed criminal to start shooting or to really prove he is dangerous for himself or for others. They neutralize him for life by inflicting him death first and wondering afterwards. In the particular case of this film the police officer who shot the boy did not get any order from his commanding officers, in fact it was the reverse, and he was under no menace from an unloaded gun and the other young man had actually said so but it must have gotten lost in translation from plain English to police speak.

Young people want to invest their tremendous energy in some cause, but they have none worth even blinking half an eye. Young people want to love everyone and find love in everyone, and not that kind of churchlike love but all the shades of love you can imagine, fatherly, motherly, friendly, brotherly, sisterly and even plain childlike and adult love. That's a lot and I can tell you that has not change since Auschwitz: love is the last thing anyone will provide the people around them on a daily basis, and if anyone tried to do that he or she would at once be classified perverse, paedophilic, peevish, petulant, in one word depraved, though in fact that someone is only trying to give what they want and need to deprived people.

But deprivation is the basic goods of this society.

Is there any hope? For the dead chap certainly not though he is going with the coat of one who was his friend and he knew it more or less. For the young man who gave his coat he found a girl friend but will that be enough of a cause to satisfy his rebellious needs? He also finally found some understanding on the side of his father and especially of his mother. Will she be able to remain that open or will she go back to her frigid paranoia and escapism? For the girl Judy she lost a boyfriend down the cliff who was a bully and she got a new one who was the bully's plaything. Did she win anything? And how long will she be able to go on with her subservient attitude: waiting for and finding the man she wants to submit to?

Without a cause and without a commitment to that cause, there is no hope on this earth and in this society. You should read the exchanges of young people on Facebook reacting at the French presidential election to understand nothing has changed. They want to commit themselves to a cause but politicians only propose them obedience to some authority, left, right or whatever, but never the reverse: let's hear from you and what you would like to commit yourself to in order to serve your society and other people, not only satisfy your personal and selfish interests.

A film that still speaks to us even if it has aged technically.

507872,5,6302685141,"The movie was nearly half a century-- but every story has its own backbround, and a good one will never be old.  Karzan did right this time. James Dean's performance was perfect, so were others'. By the way, why  ""Karl"" always felt lonely? I feel people understood him more than  understood his father--even the author would like to do so.",953683200,2,339,4.616666666666666
507873,5,6302685141,"Reading some of the reviews I noticed some people did not care for James Dean's acting style.  They feel he was being over dramatic.  What was great about James Dean was he had the ability to show his emotions in a way that  seemed so real.  Maybe these people are forgeting just how  ""corny"" we all can act in dramatic situations.  This film spoke  to its generation.  It made it alright to be a kid.  It took the idea that  children were virtual slaves to their parents and showed just how wrong  this belief was.",950400000,5,515,4.315789473684211
507904,5,6302685141,"Brilliant in every sense of the word. Especially through my adolescent eyes I felt myself relating beyond description. In an almost eerie way James Dean captures the emotions of the angst-ridden youth, every single  detail down to the last breath is skillfully orchestrated. Definitely a  film that stands beyond the test of time and immortalizes Dean and Wood in  way that they could never do on their own",949104000,4,406,4.9411764705882355
507905,5,6302685141,"A great film, complete classic. As a person who did not grow up anywhere near the 50s/60s this film still relates. The language may have changed now, and mannerisms, but surely that's the film's appeal. This portrays  modern human worries with a healthy does of Dean glamour. Emminently  quotable too!",943488000,2,301,5.0
507906,3,6302685141,"This is one of those not-that-great 50's movies that remains fascinating, if only because it remains such a sincere effort at picturing the early disintegration of family life that began in the affluent 50's, but is so  burdened with phoney method acting and bad casting (typical for the 50's),  it makes you wanna cry.  James Dean tries too hard, resulting in a very bad  impression of Brando.  Natalie Wood needed to go back to acting school, and  the over-rated Sal Mineo is so bad it's embarrassing.  The older, old-pro  actors of the period really show up the younger performers (good heavens,  even Jim Backus turns in an excellent performance!).  The writing far  exceeds the abilities of the youngsters in the cast, and the music is  phenomenally gorgeous but disappears under all the artificial acting of the  35-year-old ""teenagers"".  It's a shame, because this film truly  had something daring to say to its Eisenhower era audience; it's no wonder  so many youngsters identified strongly with the message.  But James Dean?  He may have been a promising talent, but even if he'd lived longer, that  promise would be a long time maturing.  He is probably one of the most  irritatingly ""mannered"" actors in the Hollywood of those days,  making basic mistakes that even grammar-school drama students are trained  to avoid.  But, darn it, this is STILL a movie to be seen, and seen again,  if for no other reason than to see the early beginnings of the  counter-culture that would erupt more openly in the 60's.  One  compensation: the photography is quite good, even with that washed-out 50's  Warner-Bros. color, and the main theme music is captivating.  And the story  line and dialogue are, for its time, much better than the drivel you get in  many of today's socially 'serious' films.  I was 15 when I saw this film at  its initial release, and I can say that although it is flawed it is a  *VERY* fifties piece of work that accurately defines the culture of the  time, as well as the best and worst of that era's movie-making.",942624000,10,2039,4.77521613832853
507907,3,6302685141,"I'm a fan of old movies, and I'm a fan of James Dean.  But this movie fell short of my expectations.  I found it shallow, and just plain silly... perhaps I'm just out of touch with that generation.  When you think about  it, Plato is the real Rebel Without A Cause... and I really didn't like  that character.  Maybe that's why this movie isn't so good, not enough  Dean.",934675200,5,371,4.2898550724637685

Knife fights??? ""only jabbing no stabbing""????? lmaooooo
Everyone in the moive was 30
James Dean has so many wrinkles on his face you could play a scrimmage on that shit
James Dean's character thinks he's all that just because he wears bomber jackets.
Dude thinks he's edgy af but probably only listened to Dean Martin or some shit lmao

3/10 - only because it made me laugh at how out of date this film was",1525824000,,560,4.490196078431373

7830503,4,6302685141,"Rebel Without a Cause has been a long time favorite for me, but I hadn't watched it for years. I watched it last weekend and I fell in love all over again. Dean, Mineo, and Wood manage to capture the nuanced ways in which teenagers are weird and dramatic, and it's a real loss to cinematic history that all three had their careers cut short.

The only thing I don't really like about the movie is that some on-screen emotions (particularly at the end) that do not match the watcher's emotions. It gives off a really disorienting feeling, but for all I know that was the intent. I personally am not a fan of the mismatched feelings, but it's such a small portion of the movie I just overlook it.",1522108800,,694,4.338461538461538
