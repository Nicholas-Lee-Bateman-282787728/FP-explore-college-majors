The events go back centuries in the past analysing why we have a certain kind of situation today. The explanations of historical events are eye opening such as:
 How did the Spanish thirst for gold contribute to inflation?
 The origin of bank notes and its similarity to promissory clay tablets of ancient Babylon
 The role of cotton bonds in the fall of the Confederacy
 The origin of the Fibonacci sequence and the evolution of mathematics in Europe
 The events that led to the birth of banking
 History of financial markets, property markets and hedge funds

It is a very fascinating read as he gives his perspective of how finance plays a very crucial role in shaping countries and societies. The book is rich with detailed examples and it takes up time to finish this book as it covers such a vast area. It studies the effects of boom/busts and their consequences. He throws light onto the brilliant minds who have helped shape our modern reality of money. Niall Ferguson is successful in depicting our current financial position into the larger context of history.

We recommend it to anyone who likes finance, history and good quality content.",1420156800,,1306,4.799107142857143
