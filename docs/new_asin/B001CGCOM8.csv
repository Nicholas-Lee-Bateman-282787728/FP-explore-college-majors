8287562,5,B001CGCOM8,"It is an excellent documentary that vividly underscores why it is vital to life and freedom to keep and bear arms.  The 2nd amendment was never about hunting or home defence, it has always been about citizens protecting themselves against their own governments",1390003200,,260,5.046511627906977

8287564,5,B001CGCOM8,"If every American watched this 58-minute video it would change this country dramatically for the better. This documentary shows how and why governments disarm their citizens, and the results that often follow. The major genocides of the twentieth century are described showing the pattern of deceitful gun control legislation (""For public safety""), leading to citizen disarmament, leading to the slaughter of approximately 170 million innocent people by their own governments in a 100 year period. The true nature of gun control legislation is exposed, showing that historically and statistically, an individual is at far greater risk of being disarmed and murdered by his own corrupt power-hungry government than by street criminals. We must learn from history because our lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on it.
