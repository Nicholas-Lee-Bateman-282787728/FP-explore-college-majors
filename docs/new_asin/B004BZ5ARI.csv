4321123,3,B004BZ5ARI,We were anxciously awaiting the arrival of this DVD in our house only for it to arrive and my son did not pay any attention to it. He has watched it a few times and is starting to like it a bit more but definetly not his favorite.,1298851200,,230,3.8125
4321124,5,B004BZ5ARI,"perfect for pre-K and up, educational fun and lively a thousand times better then barney same ole same old and they are original too",1298592000,,132,4.541666666666667
4321125,3,B004BZ5ARI,"We were anxiously awaiting this release.  We LOVE the Wiggles.  However, this dvd is the least favorite of them all.  The music and dancing are fun.  The days of the week are confusing and since when are they associated with a certain food?  Certainly they could have found some more creative and meaningful way to celebrate food.  They are the WIGGLES!  Also, the introduction of the new Field baby and the song on safe ways for a baby to sleep is totally innappropriate for a preschool video.  Since when is this a responsibility of a child or even a child's thought?  I do not want my child worrying about Sudden Infant Death.  This is an adult concern entirely.  We want our fun and silly Wiggles back!  Toot-Toot Chugga Chugga!",1298592000,2,732,4.589147286821706
4321126,3,B004BZ5ARI,"This video was not done as well as the past ones they have out. There are a ton of better Wiggles videos then this. I also do not think there is really a strong focus on eating healthy as advertised. I would have to say after seeing them live and owning 8 other dvds this has to be the worst one so far. My 2 1/2 year enjoys it but it does not get him dancing and singing like the others. If this video is on for him to watch I can switch it out or turn it off with no complaints, not like the other wiggles DVD's he has. I would recommend skipping this one.",1298419200,,558,3.8189655172413794
4321127,4,B004BZ5ARI,"This DVD is charming and educational and great for dealing with children with eating problems.  However, the children were confused when the Wiggles were singing Monday is Muffin Day and they sang, ""Monday is the first day of the week.""  The children immediately chimed in that Monday is the second day of the week.  I told them that in the United States that Sunday is the first day of the week, but maybe, in Australia, Monday is the first day of the week. That seemed to satisfy them but of course each time the Wiggles sung about a day of the week they were off a day according to the U.S. calendar. And the kids let me know about it quickly. But other than that, there is a lot of energy and excitement in the music.  The sets are spectacular.  The music is tantalizing.  And the Wiggles are as loving and as wonderful as ever. The guests are fun.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. The DVD definitely deserves a 5-star rating but I'm giving it a 4-star because of the confusion the kids had about the days of the week.",1297987200,,1023,4.409574468085107
4321128,2,B004BZ5ARI,"My son (and our family) love the Wiggles, and I was really excited to bring this new DVD home, but was quickly disappointed.  The theme of ""Let's Eat"" was attractive to us as my son does have some feeding issues, but the DVD is loosely themed on healthy eating.  The songs are not the usual catchy, memorable songs that we have come to expect from the Wiggles.  The various numbers seemed like recycled elements from their last few DVDS...same costumes, same dance moves (and the song about digestion sounds almost exactly like ""Hot Poppin' Popcorn"").  I was perplexed at the addition of a number by Paul Field (Anthony's brother)...the song and message was about preventing SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome)...and while it is an important message, it seems like it would have been more appropriately placed in the Special Features section of the DVD rather than smack dab in the middle of a children's show.  Speaking of the Special Features...they too were disappointing.  We looked forward to the interview with Sam about his new baby, but it was really just a lacklustre interview of him sitting in the studio and he showed a grainy picture of his daughter from his phone.  Another odd addition was a little segment about Hanukkah and the dreidel song.  Again, nice segment, informational and would be perfect on a Holiday DVD, but strangely out of place on Let's Eat!  We miss all the familiar faces of the Wiggly Dancers, but of course they have to move on and change...that's to be expected...but Ben, Ryan, and the others always seemed like family.  On a positive note, it was nice to see each Wiggle get some solo time in various songs...especially Jeff.  This one really let us down...even my son got bored half way through...guess we'll stick to some of our other Wiggly favorites.  We still love the Wiggles, but this DVD just didn't measure up to some of their others.",1297987200,10,1883,4.777777777777778
4321129,5,B004BZ5ARI,My kids like the Wiggles. Let's Eat is one of their favorites. They ask to watch it all the time.,1355097600,,97,3.9
4321130,5,B004BZ5ARI,"Pretty much every song in here is great...
My son has so much fun singing and dancing along.
One of our favorites for sure:-)",1338595200,,125,4.25
4321131,5,B004BZ5ARI,"I adore all songs from this movie, including ""Seven Days of the Week"".  It reminds me of their Wiggly Waffle Show on Sprout.

Kathleen Warren, writer for the Wiggles played Aunt Nellie who owns a very unusual farm, and Mic Conway sings about digesting your food... and of course, Tom Miglynn  and Captain Feathersword take turns singing a song about fishing for squid.

My new favorite song from Let's Eat is ""Sound Your Funky Horn"".",1322697600,,433,4.733333333333333
4321132,5,B004BZ5ARI,Purchased this for a 3 yr old who loves the Wiggles.  Its great and has lots of bouncy music and entertaining segments as well as some educational info for parents and caregivers who might be watching.  She has 5-6 Wiggles CDs now and this is one of the best,1316736000,,258,4.244897959183674
4321133,5,B004BZ5ARI,"I was very pleased with the music in this video, and my 2 year old loves it! I appreciate that there is a children's group that is counscientious of their audience and how they use this to deliver not only entertaining but practical lessons. Children learn through play, and the Wiggles deliver a full punch of fun and education in Let's Eat!

The decision to include the song on sleeping baby on his back was especially brilliant and just may help save a life one day. I just think of a child going to see his brother or sister and that they rolled over in an unsafe position, they would know to tell their parents. Great great great job Wiggles!

Just one question though. Why isn't Anthony wearing shoes?? He is in his black socks through the entire thing!",1308182400,2,759,4.453237410071942
4321134,3,B004BZ5ARI,"After watching ""Let's Eat!"" with my boys (ages 3 and 5) a few times, I am still undecided as to whether I like it or dislike it.  The boys like it quite well!  I do agree that the tunes are catchy; Grandpa said many of them are old songs from the 40s, 50s, or 60s -- such as ""Alabama Jubilee"" and ""England Swings"". The days-of-the-week songs are cute, and there's a song about hand-washing, which I think is a good encouragement for kids.  I guess if there's one thing that bothers me a bit, it's that Anthony seems particularly ""wiggly"" on this DVD, girating his hips and shimmy-ing frequently.",1304380800,,595,4.440366972477064
4321135,5,B004BZ5ARI,"I think we have almost every Wiggles DVD there is, and this is a great addition to our collection!  My daughters are 2 and 5, and they both LOVE The Wiggles!  We all enjoy the classics but we like the new songs they come out with too!  My girls are already singing along with this one, and they love the fun songs and characters.  This DVD gets them up and dancing, which is why we love The Wiggles so much!  My husband did think it was a little strange that they talked about SIDS on the DVD, but it wasn't a big deal.  The songs are great and the kids love the DVD!",1301270400,,567,3.9734513274336285
4321136,2,B004BZ5ARI,"We have about 10 Wiggles DVD's and my 15 month old twins and 3 1/5 year old love them all.  I put on this one and was very disappointed.  The kids didn't even sit thru 10mnutes of it, and they usually ask to watch their other Wiggles DVD's over and over again.  SOng about washing your hands after you go to the bathroom to prevent disease spreading and a song about putting your baby to sleep on their back...REALLY?  This was a huge dissapointment and not up to my expectations for the Wiggles.",1300665600,2,496,4.301075268817204
4321137,4,B004BZ5ARI,"After the release of ""Hot Poppin' Popcorn"" I was dubious about this new DVD. (I thought HPP was not very good at all; more importantly, my daughter didn't care to watch it more than twice.) But, being Wiggles fans, I bought it anyway with the hope of finding redemption. And we did.

I have to admit, though, it took me watching this 2-3 times with my daughter before I came to appreciate it. My daughter, on the other hand, loves it! The tunes are catchy. The scenes, though in standard green-screen with added background, are bright and colorful. And the songs are more forwardly educational than their other songs. (There's a song about hand-washing, brushing teeth, the mechanics of digestion, etc.)

Not all the songs really correlate with the theme of eating/healthy habits. For example, there is a tidbit about Hanukkah followed by the song ""Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel."" But, this straying occurs on nearly all of their videos and you just kind of go with it because the songs are fun. I do agree with one reviewer that stated the blurb on SIDS seems out of place, and would be more appropriately placed in the special features section.

For the Dorothy fans, there are two good songs with her. There is also a good Wags song. I don't recall seeing Henry anywhere, not even in the background. He could be there somewhere, but I just don't remember seeing him. Not being a Henry fan, I'm not too upset by this. If you watch Sprout's Wiggly Waffle, you will recognize some of the songs, so that's kind of fun.

The two best songs according to my daughter: ""England Swings"", a cover of the 1965 hit by Roger Miller. She wants to watch this over and over and over. The other is ""Tom Love-Eatin."" Both of these songs make you really want to get up and dance.

Overall, this is a fun, peppy DVD with great new songs. As a comparison, I'd rate ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"" and ""The Big, Big Show"" as 5 stars; this one and ""The Wiggles Go Bananas"" as 4; and ""Hot Poppin Popcorn"" as 2.",1299369600,5,1985,4.502777777777778
4321138,5,B004BZ5ARI,"I DO NOT KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT ON HERE...this DVD is totally fun and one of their more educational DVDS they have ever made.
The sing a song about washing your hands, brushing your teeth and the list goes on and on. The song Tom Love-Eatin has Anthony dressed as a Scottish Bag Piper. The songs are very catchy and the Yellow Bird song is so beautiful.
Anthony even get so sing a song on this DVD.

If you LOVE Anthony you will love him in this video, I'm an Anthony fan. I think the song about SIDS is a great addition to this DVD.  The WIGGLES KNOW KNOW KNOW that moms are just as into the Wiggles and even more so than their toddles a lot of the time...that is why they added this song.

This DVD even has a song about DIGESTION on it and my personal favorite is the GET UP AND DANCE song called Sound Your Funky Horn...

It's a beautiful DVD...with a fun cast and all ORIGINAL songs. It's an amazing work of art and I congratulate the Wiggles on a JOB WELL DONE...

BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!  You will love it moms!!!",1299024000,,1036,4.078817733990148

8422555,2,B004BZ5ARI,"This is the strangest Wiggles we have ever seen.  It's like they are trying to be like the Beetles when they were on drugs.  Someone else commented that it's nice they are trying to appeal to the adults, but it's not an adult video, it's for the kids.  None of the songs are very catchy.  If you can even understand the words, you could never remember them.  And Anthony is trying way too hard to draw attention to himself.  When everyone else is dancing normally, he's acting very obnoxious.  And he's not even wearing shoes!  We love the Wiggles, but this is just to weird.  Glad they settled down again with the new group.",1399852800,,625,4.412280701754386
8422556,5,B004BZ5ARI,We love this DVD. It has such great toddler Wiggles dancing music that the parents love so much. We don't mind our 3 yr old don wanting to play it over and over.,1389484800,,161,3.909090909090909
8422557,5,B004BZ5ARI,I was so happy to find this DVD.  My son collects Wiggles DVDs and sometimes they are hard to find.  A good buy.,1388793600,,112,3.8260869565217392
8422558,4,B004BZ5ARI,"My 15 month old son is a huge fan of The Wiggles. This dvd is worth the money. It's not as good as The Wiggles Go Bananas since the songs aren't as catchy. However, it's better than Hot Poppin' Popcorn because HPP is sooo low budget. I do recommend this dvd especially since Sam Moran (the only Wiggle with talent) is still part of the group.",1359590400,,342,4.196969696969697
8422559,3,B004BZ5ARI,"We went from early Wiggle DVDs (2003) to this one and I was disappointed. First, none of the songs are very catchy. Whereas the old songs had a strong melody and simple lyrics, these songs are all over the place. The musical choices are really bizarre and seem to be into ragtime, circus, etc. music. I'm not sure the purpose of Albama Jubilee with the guy carrying around the bible, etc. - are they making fun of southern Christians? You would think this DVD would be about eating, but I would say only a few songs are. The production is way CG-heavy but that doesn't really add much. They try to film groups separately and them cram them all onto the screen so you can't actually see much detail. A good example of that is the song with them in the diner... and really there isn't much of a good melody to that one either. There is a song which is really nothing more than them all fake laughing. Overall, I just didn't like the style of this DVD compared to the others.",1356825600,,972,4.316939890710382
