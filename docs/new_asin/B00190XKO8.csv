3422008,5,B00190XKO8,"Could not be happier with the product and shipping time.  As for the movie, excellent movie, great story, great acting, great characters, they all had their own story to tell and everything came together great.  Movie is happy, sad, drama, funny and a great setting for the movie.  This is one of my all time favorites.",1304467200,,319,4.660714285714286
3422009,2,B00190XKO8,"Apparently this movie never even had a theatrical release and went straight to video since there is not one review of it on Rotten Tomatoes, at least at the date I'm writing this. That's probably as it should be because it's  unfortunately just not a very good film. I caught it on Starz and am glad I didn't pay $10 bucks to see it at a theater. The photography is quite good, the scenery nice (even if it is the Santa Barbara CA area masquerading as Vermont!), the acting adequate but the plot line and script are both predictable and unbelievable especially in the last half of the film. It's a movie that I really wanted to like but just couldn't warm to! Shame on the producer's brother for his over-inflated review (more a shameless plug!) of this definitely mediocre flick!",1238716800,2,780,4.531914893617022
3422010,3,B00190XKO8,"This movie is nice to watch at home. I don't think I would have liked it so much in a theatre, only because it works more like a t.v. pic. The storyline is somewhat routine, but the scenery is really pretty and the performances are very good. The lead actor who plays JP Barton and leading actress Kimberly McCullough ( Alice ) look good and are appealing together. And anytime I get a chance to watch Kimberly McCullough extend herself beyond the soap opera General Hospital is always welcomed.",1237939200,,495,4.573033707865169
3422011,3,B00190XKO8,"I will start by saying the first 5 star review was written by Jed Selkowitz, the brother of Adam Selkowitz, who is one of the producers of this very mediocre movie. While I find this conflict of interest unseemly, it is apparently not in violation of Amazon's review policy.

It was very hard to get into the story when they keep talking about being in Vermont, all the while showing what is clearly a west coast setting- dry, brown grass and scrub oak. The ""700 year old oak tree"" they show appears to be a western live oak! The hills surrounding the lake are bare and brown, with what appears to be some remnants of a forest fire (lots of scrub and a few trees)!

This movie was in fact filmed entirely in Los Olivos, California, and boy howdy, does it show!

There is a reason the mountains in Vermont are called the ""Green Mountains""- it's because they are GREEN! The name ""Vermont"" means ""Green Mountain"".

I can handle a few mistakes in details, but this is like making a movie about life in New York City and filming it in Tijuana, Mexico! it is just too much! The story is much too trite to cover up this blunder.

Did the filmmaker really believe it wouldn't be noticed?

If you've never seen the United States, then perhaps you won't notice- but if you have then you will have trouble suspending your disbelief.

The story itself is sappy, trite and derivative.

Seen a boy meets girl flick before? Then you needn't bother with this drivel.

That they were able to get any funding for this waste of celluloid is a real testament as to the sorry state of Hollywood today.

If I could un-watch this, I would!

Avoid this film. See ""The Movie Hero"" instead. Low budget, but brilliantly done.

Shame on Adam Selkowitz for enlisting relatives to review his work.

If it can't stand on it's own merits, then let it go, man. It's gone.

Bottom line: Terrible movie made worse by stupid location. They didn't even try.",1236384000,,1920,4.4798850574712645
3422012,5,B00190XKO8,"Truly a great film for family and friends alike. This is a terrific first effort by these filmmakers. Beautifully shot, this film brings together a young adult's struggle with his own identity and finding himself. The strong cast (you'll know them all when you see them) credibly delivers this 'coming of age' story in a witty, authentic and humorous way. Rent it or buy it for the family.",1227571200,4,389,4.735294117647059
3422013,1,B00190XKO8,The description says this movie is family friendly.  It is not.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It's like a bad after school special with a lot of profanity.,1492646400,7,175,4.242424242424242
3422014,2,B00190XKO8,"Am I the only one that noticed just how ridiculous this movie was?  I usually write very positive reviews, but this movie was just bad.  The entire story didn't make any sense.  We start with JP, a likable guy, who tries to attract a woman by lying to her- and then when he gets found out he still doesn't come clean.  He's a goof that obviously has no idea what he wants out of life.  The girl he is trying so hard to impress is an absolute witch until the very end- then all of a sudden she saves the day.  She won't even listen to any of his attempts to explain, and it is honestly just frustrating that he even bothers.  Then we meet Eric, some jerk from NY who is SO obviously trying to take over the resort property for his own needs.  He's drugging an old lady (his own grandmother) to get her to sign the place over to him in her will.  He continually refers to JP as 'not family'- yet it was clear that the older woman found JP as an infant and adopted him.  The story goes from no one believing JP and him actually getting arrested- to all of a sudden everyone is on his side and thinks he's family?  There is a happy ending- but I would hesitate to call this a coming of age story as advertised.  There are so many flashbacks that just happen, it can be downright disorienting!  I can't even recommend this as a rainy day family film.  The scenery is nice- that's about it.  There are way better options out there.",1492387200,9,1425,4.149635036496351

I chose to watch this because I DO live in Vermont,  and was excited to see a film featuring our small, wild state. There was a Vermont license plate, and a green mountain coffee cup (their coffee is actually pretty good if you ever visit VT). So, there was some attempt to make it seem real, but even the deer are not the same kind we have here! The story was cute, but corny. I did like the ending.
Please people, if naming a film about the ""GREEN mountains,"" Film it there! There are a plethora of actual Vermont locations that would have been perfect for this film.",1481760000,4,657,4.341463414634147

8271497,4,B00190XKO8,"Another underdog, good-guy-wins movie.  Satisfying ending.  Probably won't watch it again, but I wouldn't hesitate to suggest someone watch it.

But WHAT'S with the description on the Amazon Video?  ""Greener Mountains is a family friendly, coming-of-age story about finding your place in the world.""  REALLY?

Here's the real description of what you'll see (from the movie description):  ""Greener Mountains is the coming of age story of JP Barton, an adopted son raised on a throwback Vermont family resort. Since being found as an infant by the resort's elderly owner, JP has essentially never left the grounds. But with the arrival of a beautiful, free-spirited New York artist his sheltered life is suddenly turned upside down.""

And without adding too many spoilers, meet JP who thinks he's not good enough for this artist so creates a fictitious biography to impress her; of course he is discovered, artist leaves in a huff, and he's a basket case because he has lost his one true love and soulmate.  Then enter the scheming and conniving grandson who intends by fair means or foul to gain access to his grandmother's estate and write this adopted son out of the inheritance.

Of course, you know it all comes out exactly right at the end.  The hick-from-the-sticks good guy comes out on top, and the savvy and crafty city guy comes out with nothing.

Now, you can at least make an intelligent decision as to whether or not to watch the movie.",1523664000,,1448,4.865306122448979
