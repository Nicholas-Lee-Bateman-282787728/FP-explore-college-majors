5424120,4,B00AG471ZM,"Based on a Philip K. Dck short story, director John Woo's PAYCHECK is a breathlessly-paced paranoia sci-fier.

The central character is a high-tech engineer named Jennings (Affleck), He agrees to have his memory erased after a three-year project in which he creates (for a $92 million fee) a machine that can see the future of whomever is operating it.

No sooner does Jennings get paid but the millions disappear out of his bank account and now a team of assassins are out to kill him. Long-time pal Shorty (Giamatti), plus Rachel (Thurman), a lover he can no longer remember, and a mysterious manilla envelope that contains 20 seemingly innocent items (like a newspaper crossword puzzle, a pair of sunglasses, a paper clip, etc.) are the only weapons Jennings has to fight back with.

This exciting actioner has the requisite grand finale plus a happy post-trauma plot twist. Definitely worth seeing.

5424125,4,B00AG471ZM,"Don't let the professional film critics deter you. This is an exciting and entertaining film, once you buy into the 'set-up' of the plot.  I found it to be a rollercoaster ride of tension, thrills, romance and humor that was well-paced. Ben Affleck plays the lead role with conviction, and the supporting cast (Aaron Eckhart and Colm Feore in particular as the bad guys) lends credulity to an incredulous story.  Not a 5-star film but certainly an engaging sci-fi thriller.",1434067200,3,473,4.9

Plus, back then I barely knew who Phillip K Dick was, but now, when I realized this was yet another movie based on his sci-fi writing, it also made me look at it differently.",1493683200,,378,4.263888888888889
