7090028,5,B00VGXKW7G,Loved this DVD!!!  I hope it returns next season,1464134400,,48,4.333333333333333
7090029,5,B00VGXKW7G,"This is perhaps one of the best comedies to ever get cancelled in it's first season. If ABC would have aired it in a better timeslot than Friday night's after the conservative Last Man Standing it most likely would still be on the air. Exceptionally casted show, not a weak link among them as there usually is in new shows. In all the episodes the pilot is the only episode that has a few misses, it's not as funny as the rest of the episodes and seems to drag on a few times.
This being my first Amazon manufactured on demand dvd set I was surprised to see it came with nice packaging, something you'd expect to see on store shelves. I thought the discs would just come in a black dvd case but there is front and back covers with all the episodes listed on the back cover and the discs all have high quality labels on them. Only thing that would have made this set better is if it came with some special features such as a gag reel.",1463443200,2,933,4.1602209944751385
7090030,5,B00VGXKW7G,Can't believe they took cristela off the air. This was one of the best sitcoms ever compared to 2 broke girls worst acting I've seen. Bring Cristela back.,1453420800,3,154,4.535714285714286
7090031,5,B00VGXKW7G,"This was a great series that shouldn't have been cancelled.  I'm glad to have the DVD so I can watch it now and then. It didn't work in our very old DVD player but worked fine in a newer one.  Look forward to the next thing Cristela Alonzo does, meanwhile I try to catch her stand-up when I can.",1453248000,,295,3.983050847457627
7090032,5,B00VGXKW7G,Very awesome. Brand  spanking new packaging and no scratches found on any of the discs.,1453248000,,87,4.8
7090033,3,B00VGXKW7G,"Cristela is certainly a talented comedienne and all the characters in the show are likeable, so it is sort of entertaining. The main problem is the recurring theme of racism and discrimination from white people towards Latinos, which gets very preachy and tiresome. It is not just hinted at, but head on blasting criticism at every episode, and it is just NOT FUNNY and becomes so predictible.
This had the potential to be a good funny show about Latino family life, like the great George Lopez show years ago, but missed the mark.",1448582400,2,531,4.720430107526882
7090034,5,B00VGXKW7G,"This show is really good. Never knew who Cristela Alonzo was until this show. The characters are hilarious. The mom cracks me up including rich girl, Maddie. Hopefully it gets the real DVD treatment (Blu-ray will be better) instead of those awful DVD-R releases. Also bonus features would be nice. Roseanne Barr guest appearance was hilarious.",1433548800,,343,5.142857142857143
7090035,5,B00VGXKW7G,"I too love this show.  I watch a few episodes every day on Hulu, but I want to own it so that I can always watch it
The ensemble cast is amazing.  There is not a weak link in the bunch that what makes you want to keep watching.
ABC made a big mistake canceling this.  I Hope another network takes it up.
YEs, it is classic and it makes me laugh every time!",1433376000,4,356,3.7837837837837838
7090036,5,B00VGXKW7G,Love this show!!!!! Plz renew for SSN 2 cristela your amazing reminds me of golden age of tv!!!! Roseanne!!!,1430092800,3,108,4.7368421052631575
8710063,5,B00VGXKW7G,"I really loved the Cristela show! I thought that she was very attractive, incredibly funny and really sharp! Man, the whole entire cast was just awesome and just had some great chemistry together! It was the type of show that the whole family could sit down and enjoy together! I laughed and laughed and had a really great time watching Cristela. Bought the DVD as soon as I could! Now I can binge-watch the whole entire amazing series whenever I want!

Sadly, though, ABC television network canceled CRISTELA after only just one season but then they let a whole lot of really awful and lame shows have numerous seasons on their airwaves! Then, the ABC executives sit in their big fancy air conditioned offices and wonder why their T.V. ratings are WAY down and why every one's flocking in droves over to HULU, YOUTUBE, and NETFLIX.

Ssssshhhhhhh!..No one tell them. That's why the ABC executives make the big bucks.",1532217600,,916,4.754716981132075

8710065,5,B00VGXKW7G,By far the best comedy I have ever seen.  ABC blew it by not renewing this amazing honest truthful hilarious comedy. I have never felt like a show related to me and my life like this one did. I watch these DVD's so often I worry that I will wear them out and not be able to get another copy.  Though I know it probably can't happen I still hold a glimmer of hope that one-day the tv big wigs will get a clue and restart this show with a season 2 on ANY network.,1514678400,,461,3.8421052631578947

8710068,5,B00VGXKW7G,This sitcom is good.  It should have gone further than one season.  The DVD playback quality is really good.  A great gift for the lover of comedy!,1506988800,,147,4.37037037037037
