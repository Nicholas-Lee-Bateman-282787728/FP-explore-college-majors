Even though Russo committed the murder, 8 yrs ago that sent his brother to the slammer, he didn't seem to be on edge now that his brother who did the time, was back. He was a friend to his brother but bad things just continue to happen for ole james russo ""tommy"" He's just a bad messed up guy and his fate was finally due. In the end, at the very end, he finally manned up and took the heat and the blame and got a chest full of bullets from the cops. I'm the one you want""",1451520000,,730,4.076388888888889
7988664,5,B000092WD1,"Talk about an under-the-radar movie, this is it. The story of a convict released from jail and returning to his hometown is both engaging and realistic. Add to this an absolutely wonderful cast - led by the remarkable Tim Roth - and the entire story adds up to a winner.

There is a specific plot twist, which Roth handles so beautifully that I believe it is one of his finest performances ever.

Yes, this is low budget but the entertainment value is high. Indeed, even a week after watching the movie on late night cable, it still haunts me (in a good way). The only problem I'm having now is finding a US region copy of the DVD. Highly Recommended!",1431388800,,651,4.416666666666667
7988665,1,B000092WD1,The dvd does not work in my new sony dvd player.  It says format not recognized.  So i have to throw the dvd out.  Ive been had.  Thanks for the garbage.  And i paid a premium price for the movie.,1413417600,,196,3.8
7988666,5,B000092WD1,"This is one of those movies that reaffirms what you like so much about Tim Roth. The same evil popinjay from Rob Roy is the sweetest ex-con you'll ever meet in this movie. It has a graphic scene of brutal violence or two, but otherwise a great all around drama. I don't know if it exists in NTSC format, but this version is PAL, and I must've missed that detail....",1360713600,,365,4.228571428571429
7988667,4,B000092WD1,"I had never heard of this film until 2012, but wow it is really, really good.

All the casting and performances are good, but I was amazed at Tim Roth's. There aren't many - if any - British actors who could have carried off Roth's pitch perfect portrayal of this down-on-his-luck urban American character, Joey.  I was transfixed at the transformation of Roth, just as I am when watching different characters played by Daniel Day Lewis. The film is worth watching for many reasons, but Roth makes it worth watching for his performance alone.

James Russo, as the despicable but charming older brother Tommy, plays a perfect foil to the vulnerable, pleasing Joey.

And it doesn't hurt that Debra Unger is delicious to behold, a fallen angel.

Strongly recommend - certainly one of the best and most overlooked films that I know of.

7988668,5,B000092WD1,"Gritty and realistic unknown independent piece about slow young man (brilliant Roth) just released from prison struggling to stay clean while living with his troublemaker older brother (Russo at his best) and his battered wife (Unger, in a tender performance). Buddy Giovinazzo's low-budget 'No Way Home' is a perfect example of a  near flawless gem of a film with a superb cast that went hugely unnoticed during its release. Packed with raw emotion, masterful performances and a genuine Staten Island setting, I find it very unfortunate that movies like this are so rare to come by. I saw this once years ago on IFC Channel and been wanting to see it again ever since. Unfortunately its nearly impossible to find a version that'll play on standard American DVD players, so I was forced to watch the one I ordered on my PC (shipped from the UK). Do I care? Not really. 'No Way Home' was well worth it.",1322352000,3,901,4.7025316455696204
7988669,5,B000092WD1,"One of the most underrated movies ever.  If you look at the top grossing movies of 1997 you will see such gems as ""Face Off,"" ""Flubber,"" ""Liar, Liar,""""George of the Jungle..."" You get the picture.  That these movies made hundreds of millions of dollars and this movie has slipped into obscurity to the point that you can't even find it is a crime.

Everyone in this movie does an excellent job of simply telling a story, and it's a really good story.  Be careful about ordering this on DVD as the DVD's that were available when I bought it were all European and will not play on North American DVD players.  I got the VHS for about $3.00.  You won't regret it.",1307923200,2,660,4.368852459016393
7988670,5,B000092WD1,"I won't give away the plot.  You really need to see it in order to understand what I mean.  If you are a Tim Roth fan, he doesn't disappoint.  His acting is believable, just like the story he helps to tell, which is as old as time.

7988671,4,B000092WD1,"A movie need not have high-tech imagery, nor an explosion every 30 minutes to be a good movie. This movie proved this theory.
This movie showed that in life, some people can adapt and overcome the most horrific of life  events, and others can't.",947289600,6,245,4.568181818181818
