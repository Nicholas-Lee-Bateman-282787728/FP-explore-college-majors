8622946,1,B00GGZ7ZT2,"The dvd is a rip off, as much  I as like Frank Zappa music, but its way too short, not even one song is at least 15 or 20 minutes long. I reccomend buying it when it goes down in price, because its a only less than 30 minutes long.

I also love Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton, bob dylan, etc. not just frank zappa., I'm not narrow minded, lol

Who ever does this should knock down the price alot because its not 30 minutes long",1399766400,,424,3.9647058823529413
