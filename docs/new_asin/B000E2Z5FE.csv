8104582,3,B000E2Z5FE,"Umberto lenzi made this movie in 1989 , it was the followup to the
by low budget standards successful 'ghosthouse"".  This movie isn't as good as that one but if you like movies about evil witches that kill off people with evil glee for no other reason than they are evil. Then this movie is for you. The type of witch here is the type that people in the middle ages feared,  a creature that boils human heads to eat them. So this would be like the witch from hanzel and gretel but it's different than that.  The acting is done by experienced actors in this one and that helps.  The lead character dreams about the house of evil that he eventually moves into and we he does all hell breaks loose.  He thinks his wife is the evil witch but is she?  you have to see the end to find out and it's a good ending for a horror movie.  This one deserves to be put out in this region as two horror movie on one disc set. Those are always a good deal but even as a single disc this movie is enjoyable for those fans of evil old fashioned witches who are the solitary kind and you prey on people just because they are monsters.  Lenzi did a good job with this one and he made a decent horror film here that is almost as much fun as his earlier 'ghosthouse"".",1226102400,3,1245,4.073770491803279
