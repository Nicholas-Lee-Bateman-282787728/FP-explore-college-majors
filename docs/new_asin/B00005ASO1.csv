7935831,3,B00005ASO1,"This is just a 60 minutes collection of 1990-1991 interviews of the band during the ""Hot In The Shade"" and ""Revenge"" periods. The first track contains three sections: (1:47) 1.- Opening (a light documentary)// 2.- The Mystique (interviews about ""Hot In The Shade Tour"")// 3.- A New Face (same) (35:40) 4.- The Anties (same)// (19:35) 5.- Favorite Albums (1991. Turn Up The Volume. Revenge INT).
As an extra you'll find a low-budget-style photo gallery. Some of the photos here are taken from posters and picture magazines. Nice for media publishers to laugh but for kiss fans it is full of passion from who made it (4:04).
Total time(1:01:06) plus photo gallery.
TECH. DATA:-rarities interpolated during interviews-/-photo gallery with false initial start too-/-instrumental backgrund music is not from the band-/-1991 interview strts at the end of track #4-/- chronological disorder at the end of tracks #4 and #5-",1057622400,3,915,5.2312925170068025
7935832,2,B00005ASO1,"I found this very disappointing; I borrowed this from a friend, and good thing, too, because if I had known prior what the content would consist of, I would not have purchased it.  Nearly the entire 45 minutes is devoted to a very inane ""interview"" with Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons (Gene looks incredibly bored, he barely moved and said nothing for the first 10 minutes).
The dialogue is pretty much standard, by-the-book Paul and Gene shtick: saying over and over again how they'll do anything for their fans, how so many other bands have been influenced by them, being in complete denial that the then-current incarnation of the band had anything to do with (or owed anything to) the original lineup, blah blah, on and on.  The only bright spot is when Eric Singer and Bruce Kulick are given a combined 3 minutes to speak (how generous of Paul and Gene to do that), and I, like a majority of the people who reviewed this DVD am greatly disappointed that Eric Carr was barely given any mention; especially considering that Carr had passed away not long before this ""interview"" was done; out of sight, out of mind!  How sad...
Overall, this is poorly produced and just another way for Paul and Gene to glorify themselves for the umpteenth time.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone; don't waste your time or money.",1020384000,11,1316,4.6594827586206895
7935833,4,B00005ASO1,"It is the Summer of 1990 and the single Forever is riding high on the charts. Finally after nearly a year KISS is back on the road supporting Hot In The Shade with a phenomenal show that reminds many of us of the 70's KISS stage frenzies.
This video captures KISS mainmen Gene simmons and Paul Stanley backstage after a show where they do a tell all interview. unlike the many staged TV performances the guys do regularly they are very honest here and give a good insight in where KISS stands in this by many fans neglegted period in KISSTORY.
With the recording quality back in the early 90's not being of today's high standards don't expect DD 5.1 sound and a crystal clear picture but the quality serves the footage well. The dialogues are very clear through your center speakers and that's what matters. running time is 45 minutes and some really cool, some never seen, excellent quality live footage is included in the programme. At this price it is a real treat for the KISS ARMY members that own a DVD player.",996019200,11,1016,4.4972972972972975
