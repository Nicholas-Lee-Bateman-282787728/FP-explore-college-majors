4351094,5,B004EPYZQC,This film is utterly amazing from the opening scene..I was quiet as a mouse the entire 2 hours of this whole movie..i just couldn't take my eyes off the screen or yelling wooo in excitement of the absolutely amazing action sequences.. very breathtaking some of the best action scenes since Bad Boy 2...Everyone was great from Paul Walker to the surprisingly  hilarious Tyrese Gibson..The Rock was just excellent and was an interesting and smart addition to the cast.. like I said everyone was great which also made the film an even better feeling in the end. I find it hard for any other film being released this summer season too be as good as this 1 right here..because Fast 5 was a summer blockbuster at it's ultimate best. Hands Down the best of the Fast franchise.!!!!!!!!!!!!! A,1304208000,20,784,4.7226277372262775
4351095,5,B004EPYZQC,"This is just a great film. It's fun, it's loud, it's got story, and it's got gorgeous girls and amazing cars. That's the recipe for an awesome blockbuster. I'd heard the hype, and had always planned to see it, but I didn't know it would be as good as it was. it was just bada**. I came to Amazon the minute it was over to try and pre-order the Blu-ray--it is that good. Sure, it's cliche a lot of the time, but cliche doesn't have to be a bad thing. If you liked the original film then this is right on par with that--I think it's even better. I can't wait for the 6th one to come out!",1304208000,49,585,3.9661016949152543
4351096,5,B004EPYZQC,"""Fast Five"" is great! This is how the story goes: Since Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto broke Dom Toretto out of custody, they've blown across many borders to elude authorities. Now backed into a corner in Rio de Janeiro, they must pull one last job in order to gain their freedom. As they assemble their elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt businessman who wants them dead. But he's not the only one on their tail. Hard-nosed federal agent Luke Hobbs never misses his target. When he is assigned to track down Dom and Brian, he and his strike team launch an all-out assault to capture them. But as his men tear through Brazil, Hobbs learns he can't separate the good guys from the bad. Now, he must rely on his instincts to corner his prey... before someone else runs them down first.

The cast led by Vin Diesel (also produced) (as Dominic), Paul Walker (as Brian) & Dwayne Johnson (as Luke Hobbs) is great. The directing by Justin Lin (who also directed ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) & ""Fast & Furious"" (2009) is great.

The music by Brian Tyler (who also did the music to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"", ""Fast & Furious"", he also did the music, recently to, ""Battle: Los Angeles"" (2011) & the upcoming ""Final Destination 5"" (2011) is great.

Windon (who also did the cinematography to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"", ""The Postman"" (1997), ""Deep Blue Sea"" (1999) & ""House Of Wax"" (2005) is great. The film editing by Kelly Matsumoto (who also did the film editing to ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001), ""Van Helsing"" (2004), ""The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor"" (2008) & ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift""), Fred Raskin (who also did the film editing to ""The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" & ""Fast & Furious"") & Christian Wagner (who also did the film editing to ""Fast & Furious"", ""Bad Boys"" (1995), ""Face/Off"" (1997), ""The Negotiator"" (1998), ""Mission: Impossible II"" (2000), ""Spy Game"" (2001), ""Die Another Day"" (2002), ""Man On Fire"" (2004), ""The Amityville Horror"" (2005), ""The Island"" (2005), ""Domino"" (2005), ""The Uninvited"" (2009) & ""Battle: Los Angeles"") is great.

The production design by Peter Wenham (who also did the production design to ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007), ""Battle: Los Angeles"" & the upcoming ""21 Jump Street"" (2012) is great.

Artificial Intelligence"" (2001), ""Murder By Numbers"" (2002), ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), ""Jumper"" (2008) & ""Battle: Los Angeles"") is great.

This is a great sequel to the ""Fast & Furious"" movies. This is the best sequel and the best movie of the series, thus far. This is a fun and fast-paced action ride that keeps your heart racing and your mind thinking while you are on the edge of your seat. This is one of the best action movies of the year, so far.",1304121600,,4838,4.897560975609756
4351097,4,B004EPYZQC,"Just got out of the theater & I must say- This movie ROCKS!!!
Great Plot/Story Line... A lot better than the last 3...
This movie is full of Thrills, Action, Drama & great sound!!!
The special effects are AWESOME, but not too over the top!!!
It was a Huge Bonus bringing the Originals back!!!
All of the original actors fit their roles perfectly & the Dwaye Johnson fit his new role great! He added a lot of Intensity & his usual Flair... He also brought extra action in a Fantastic Fight scene with Deisel... Muscle vs Muscle!!!

There is some Racing like usual, but this installment has a lot better story & is more of COMPLETE movie...
Paul Walker & Diesel didn't miss a beat with there on screen chemistry like they had in the First movie in the series!

The Chase Scene at the end of the movie is the BEST CHASE SCENE since The Elanor Chase Scene in the Gone In Sixty Seconds movie with N.Cage!

Also, just like usual many people left when the end credits came on, but if you stay through the credits,  you will be rewarded with a nice little SURPRISE!!!

I give this movie an A & would recommend going to see it on the Big Screen!!!
I might just go and see it again!!!

Thanks for reading my review!",1304121600,2,1205,4.286343612334802
4351098,4,B004EPYZQC,"The original cast is back (sans one) and they are aiming to pull off a heist after putting together a team. The Rock is a welcome addition to the franchise as a federal agent who specializes in tracking down fugitives. There is a lot of excitement in this one, with the distinctive storyline of the bad guys being the good guys because they are stealing from worse guys. It makes sense when you see it. Are there some improbabilities that occur during the course of the action? Certainly, but if not taken too seriously, this is a good old-fashioned action film.  Car chases, gun fights and explosions are ubiquitous in Fast Five, and if that is your idea of a good time, sit back and enjoy the ride.",1304121600,,700,4.46875
4351099,4,B004EPYZQC,"I only went to see this in theatres because friends where going, and I had nothing better to do. I expected this to be just another installment of the Fast & Furious franchise of movies, with a few drag races for pink slips, a brush with the law, and a few action scenes... and yes, that all was in this one, too... but there was so much more that I was not expecting to happen, and by end of this film I was glad I had gone to see it.

The movie kicks off right where the last left off. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is broken free from his jail sentence with the help from Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who has now instantly gone from a cop to a wanted criminal. They head down to South America and cook up a scheme to make a few bucks to start a new life. So the plot doesn't sound like much, they never really did before, did they? But I can assure you that the movie has some great action scenes, and not just involving the cars this time. Now that Brian is a wanted man, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is added to the franchise as a special forces (CIA?) cop named Hobbs. The Rock seemed too buff for the role, and seemed to be overacting the stereo typical role of the muscle buffed military style leader who will not take no for an answer, but he didn't take away from the acting anymore then Vin Diesel does... ok, enough bagging the acting, because it's been no better in any other one of these movies... so why am I saying this movie is rated 3 and a half to 4 stars? The ACTION! Some of the chase scenes in this movie are the best I have seen in years, even fans of car chases in James Bond and Death Race should enjoy the ones occurring in this movie, or in particular, the closing few minutes of the movie. It really came as a surprise to me, as the movie kind of started off with action, then had some more action, then got a little boring with all the sentimental characters manly love for each other, then in the end all of a sudden ....BOOM!!!!... and I wondered to myself ""Where did that come from?"". It seemed like something fans of Oceans 11 (the remake) would love. A cleverly put together little plot that is full of twists, turns, explosions, crashes and a whole vault of excitement.

I don't know if everyone will agree with me, but this Fast & Furious, for me, is the best of the whole series. I definitely recommend you see this, if you enjoy the types of movies I mentioned, and this will sure be a DVD/BlueRay disc or two worth purchasing in a few months time.

The reason I can't give it 5, isn't because of The Rock or Vin Diesel trying to out-do each other for an Academy Award, but because a few scenes in the middle needed to be trimmed down, and the final scenes after the awesome car chase needed to be shortened way down... the whole ""where are they now""/ ""And they lived happily ever after"" things shouldn't go on for as long as they do in this. But apart from that, if you do see this, expect to see one of the best car chase scenes in a movie... EVER!

Update: DVD REVIEW. The DVD contains the theatrical and directors cut of the movie. The extended version has a deleted scene put back in about the lead up the end scheme, and a bit more blood during a gun battle towards the end of the film. Other then that, it's not very noticeable. There is a small featurette like extra where the cast and directors talk about the cars of the film, as well as two extra deleted scenes. The DVD transfer has been great, as expected, and watching it again I was able to get more into the film and understand the development scenes, so I take back what I said and I think the film has a much better flow the second viewing. Still a great get away scene at the end of the film, and I still say it's one of the best, and again, the best F&F movie so far.",1304121600,2,3771,4.147540983606557
4351100,5,B004EPYZQC,"Fast Five in my opinion is the best installment out of the 5 movies. The last one was awesome but this just had so much original action sequences with the dragging of a vault down the street causing havoc, cop cars racing and a truck you can use to steal cars off a train. Very fun movie with everything you want out of an action movie. Definitely recommended. And on a side note, the fight between the Rock & Vin Diesel is just bad a$$!",1304035200,2,437,4.152941176470589
4351101,5,B004EPYZQC,"Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster team up again for some more heart pounding adrenaline action. This movie takes place after Fast and Furious. The film brings the crew back together in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil for one last job to get their freedom before disappearing forever. Some of the previous stars through the past Fast and Furious films return, including Tyrese Gibson, (Roman Pearce - 2 Fast 2 Furious) Ludacris (Tej - 2 Fast 2 Furious), Gal Gadot, (Gisele - Fast and Furious) Matt Schulze (Vince -The Fast and Furious) and Sung Kang (Han - Tokyo Drift) all return for one of the most action packed Fast and Furious movies ever. They are faced with a tough federal agent Luke Hobbs (the Rock) who will stop at nothing to hunt them down. I will not give away any more but, I'm happy to say Fast Five does not disappoint. This Movie is action packed from start to finish, and even though it has many over the top moments it is still one heck of an enjoyable action ride. Just like the original film that started it all, this new and final installment will also have you on the edge of your seat. Don't listen to bitter critics, if you like a fun entertaining movie to take you away from your life for a few hours check this movie out! Im going to miss Paul and Vin and all the crew, but will be forever thankful for all the awesome Fast films they brought us and am happy to watch them again and again on DVD or blu-ray!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Five-Blu-ray/dp/B004EPYZQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast Five [Blu-ray</a>]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Five-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy-in-Blu-ray-Packaging/dp/B0056BU3I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast Five (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy in Blu-ray Packaging)</a>

4351102,4,B004EPYZQC,"The last three sequels hardly offered anything new, you just had more fast cars and more races. So I didn't expect much from Fast Five at all. However the movie is surprisingly fun and exciting, due to better writing and direction.
  The fast cars and races are still in the movie of course, but here you have the addition of a Ocean 11 like heist plot and the Rock as a relentless special agent named Hobbs that will do anything to get Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel) and his team.
  I just don't understand why Han (Sung Kang) from Tokyo Drift is back with no explanation to how he's still alive, since didn't he die in that movie ? But that's easy to ignore since Fast Five is fun either way and the best action film of the year so far.",1303862400,,737,4.242857142857143

4351602,5,B004EPYZQC,"Previously I have seen 2 Fast 2 Furious, and Fast & Furious (2009). Now I'm doing a review of Fast Five starring Vin Diesel, The Rock, Paul Walker (R.I.P.), and Jordana Brewster.

The Rock is an 8-time WWE champion, a two time WCW champion, a two-time Intercontinental champion, 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and a 9-time Slammy award winner. At one time he beat up John Cena at WrestleMania XXVIII. Eventually he arrives on the Fast & Furious franchise in the fifth modern installment called Fast Five..... or Fast & Furious 5 in international markets and as Wild Speed: Mega Max in Japan.

Coming out of the 4th movie, a devastation collision happens. Where does Dominic (Vin Diesel) go from here? Experience the action-packed thrill rides with a lot of smackdown and insane battles, and heartfelt moments when you watch Fast Five on Blu-ray or DVD. I love this movie because there's The Rock vs. Vin Diesel, the legendary Paul Walker, and some more Jordana Brewster being Mia. The rest of the madness sums it up.",1505520000,,1011,4.771428571428571

4351858,5,B004EPYZQC,"Probably the best in the franchise. All the previous Fast films had loose ends that kind of set you up for this domino affect and ties everything together perfectly where Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) is found guilty sentenced to 25 years to life without the possibility of parole and that's when things take a turn for the worst. Brian O' Connor (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordanna Brewster) go all out on the run from the FBI after helping Dom escape. While in Rio, they have beef with a major kingpin who runs the city and have a score to settle bringing all their past friends and partners in crime: Tez (Ludacris), Roman Pierce (Tyrese), Han (Sung Kang) and the rest of the gang altogether for one last run robbing Rio's big boss for more than $11 million dollars worth of his money and starting a new life. Only problem is: they all are being tracked down by: Hobbs (played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) who is willing to go all out and will not stop at anything to see them all behind bars. Alliances are formed and trust is in question as things begin to take an interesting turn throughout the film but one the is for sure: family always sticks together no matter what.",1496361600,,1183,4.456221198156682

4351957,5,B004EPYZQC,"Hands down my favorite of the franchise (of parts 1-5).  This is the most fun, has the coolest plot and produces the most engaging antagonists.  High octane testosterone fun for movie-goers who like high speed chases, sweaty biceps, explosions and brawling.

In this fifth installment in the Fast and Furious (2001-2017) franchise, we find our favorite characters in Brazil laying low from the American eyes of Johnny Lawbut still jacking cars!

Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel; The Last Witch Hunter, Guardians of the Galaxy, Riddick) continues to choose bare biceps over sleeves, Brian (Paul Walker; Brick Mansions, Hours, Into the Blue) and Mia (Jordana Brewster; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, Chuck, Dallas) are still an item and as close as ever, and director Justin Lin (Tokyo Drift, Fast and Furious, Fast and Furious 6, Star Trek Beyond)who helmed parts 3-6 in this worldwide franchise sensationhas become more ambitious with stunts.  God bless him for that!  We have flipping shredded prison buses, high speed plasma-cutting train heists, rocket launchers, exploding poop-launching toilets, and high speed vault dragging!

The fight choreography is getting more interesting (with each sequel), everyone has become a better martial artist, the explosions are bigger and more frequent, and cars continue to function unphased after devastating landings and hits. The action has truly been turned up to an 11 in this sequel and, after the youthful thrill of the 2001 original (I saw when I was 20 years old), this is, by far, the most entertaining and my favorite of the franchiseso far.

This film is like high octane testosterone.  Theres a lot of flexed-arm finger-pointing, flexed arm-crossing, very few shirts with sleeves, lots of yelling, lots of hard crazy-eyed stare downs, lots of large bald men in sweat-soaked overly snug shirts, and a lot of shiny biceps.  It has a lot in common with The Expendables (2010-2014) movies in that respect, only much better.

From the moment Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson; Pain and Gain, Ballers, G I Joe: Retaliation) busts on the scene every gym bro is reminded of why hes their man-crush.  Hes all business, hes a straight up killing machine andwell, its The Rock!  And whereas we meet Hobbs as an antagonist, we also have our real villain Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida; Desperado), a man of the people who spins anecdotes about why Portuguese is spoken in Brazil.  Hes exactly the refined villain you like, hate, like to hate, and want to see taken down.

Whether its Oceans Eleven (2001) or Mission: Impossible (1996), ever notice how in every movie its always one last job and then theyll retire, its always against the biggest baddest opponent they can find (like the crime lord who runs Rio), and they always need to assemble a team?
Well, a motley crew they do assemble.  They have big engines, bigger biceps, big stakes ($100 million), and the biggest team cast in the franchise so far!  They meet, greet, hug and smile as we see new friends and old friends reunite.  After Brian, Mia and Dom, theres the long and mysterious Gisele (Gal Gadot; Fast and Furious, Dawn of Justice: Batman vs Superman, Wonder Woman), the calm and cool Han (Sung Kang; Tokyo Drift, Fast and Furious, Ninja Assassin, Bullet to the Head), mouth-running Roman (Tyrese Gibson; Legion, Transformers 1-3, 2 Fast 2 Furious), tech whiz Tej (Chris Ludacris Bridges; Crash, Hustle and Flow, Gamer, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and rap performing artist), Santos (Don Omar; Fast and Furious, and performer responsible for Danza Kuduro) and Leo (Tego Calderon; Fast and Furious, Illegal Tender, and rap performing artist).  Maybe some of you thought Roman and Tej were funny characters, but Leo and Santos are show-stealing hilarious.  Nine in total, and complemented by Hobbs and Reyes.  Thats 11 stars in a part 5 movie!

Our characters exploits are scored by an outstandingly energized soundtrack.  The foot chase scene is solid, filmed with numerous wide angle shots capturing the gorgeous cityscape of Rios rooftops.  Probably the best camerawork among the first five Fast and Furious movies.  We are also wowed by one of my favorite movie fight scenes (excluding martial arts movies).  When Hobbs and Dom go at it, its like two rabid junkyard dogs on steroids.  They hits are hard, frequent, and I question how many bruises the actors left the set with at the end of the day (of course, the stunt doubles had it much worse).  There weren't enough windows and plaster walls in that entire warehouse for them to smash or throw each other through. This was a grappling, tackling, face-punch frenzy. My only gripe is that The Rock didn't win. Not Hobbs, mind youbut The Rock.  Later, seeing Dwayne The Rock Johnson limp is like going to SeaWorld to see a water show starring a killer whale with a captivity-rendered limp dorsal fin.  Its just not right. LOL.

Then there was the vault chase sceneSTUPENDOUS! At every turn we find so much property damage as they swing that vault across the road in their wake through crinkled cars and mangled buildings.  Oh, and they were wholesale MURDERING cop cars, smashing up more vehicles than a Bad Boys Michael Bay flick.

Winding down after their victory and reminding us that they're all one big criminal family, is that we have such a happy conclusion.  Much like the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003) we have a bunch of endings, only these are much more succinctly handled and won't bore audiences.  Brian and Mia got a beach house to raise their child, Tej and Roman jockey for best car in the hemisphere, Han and Gisele go honeymooning on the autobahn, and Santas and Leo do playfully dumb things with their money in casinosits all very nice.  Youll leave this movie happy.

So go see it (again), be thrilled, and be happy.",1491696000,2,5795,4.924897119341564
4351958,5,B004EPYZQC,"I have to say I never really got with the hype of these films, and although the first film was okay for what it was, I didn't think the sequels before this one were great at all, especially the Tokyo Drift one which was just stupid.  But others of course love these films so I of course ended up watching the fifth one and I was impressed!  This isn't just a driving cars in a totally unrealistic fashion with no regard for anyone on the streets (I mean that's still in here) but it also became a nice crime caper movie too. It does pick up from the storyline of the fourth movie as continuation on from that films closing sequence, but you could probably watch this without having seen that first. The Rock addition to the cast as a guy who always gets his fugitive and is on the heels of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker's characters was an interesting addition.  The movie is already overthetop so the realism factor being stretched further didn't bother me, but I thought it was interesting casting as it highlighted just how short Vin Diesel is, who for the former movies had been the big tough guy character.

Overall Fast Five was a fun flick and good crime caper.  I liked how unlike the other ones they didn't have that stupid push a button on the steering wheel and go into hyperspace speed to win a race thing that really didn't prove they were better drivers in the initial films.  They still do some overthetop stuff such as the final dragging something scene which would have easily got caught and ripped out the back of their cars if the cable didn't snap first, but overall the movie was a lot of fun and unlike the other sequels I didn't get bored watching it.",1491436800,,1671,4.374193548387097
4351959,4,B004EPYZQC,"Begins with an exciting scene as the guys aspire to acquire some vehicles which leads to a 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' -type water landing as they are in Brazil.

4353442,5,B004EPYZQC,"Originally this was purchased for our son.  We all ended up watching it as a family.  The action and suspense, fast cars and great actors made it a fun family night of movie watching.  This is one of those movies where you don't mind watching over again because of the action filled scenes.",1463788800,,290,4.433962264150943

4353444,2,B004EPYZQC,"I've read that this is supposed to be one of the ""best"" movies from the series (I've watched 7 so far) but I just don't get why. This movie is about them stealing a bunch of money from a guy (who is also a criminal). Mia is pregnant but 'can't tell Brian' (a storyline which is basically recycled in movie 7) and despite some running/crashing/falling scenes she isn't even concerned for her unborn child. Despite all that my biggest issue with this film is casting and proportion.

Casting: The guy that plays Hobbs - seriously we didn't need another beefed up guy with muscles - we had Dom - that was enough. Elena is charming but you can see the Dom-crush a mile-off. I bought this movie because Han was in it - wasn't he? This movie, to me at least, was the Brian and Dom show - it was all about them. The other characters, who I think are far more interesting had token parts. I would have liked to see more Han, Gisele and Roman - but they just didn't get to be a real part of it all - they were just there to fill in bits. In some ways this movie is just trying to be too many things, with too many characters, with a plot too poorly planned, and not enough audience investment in what actually happens.

This movie gets two stars because of it having Han (played by Sung Kang) in it but he should have had a far greater role.

Oh, the story...a bit bleh. It has chases/crashes/suspected deceit...but it doesn't save the movie from its dismal fate.",1463097600,,1454,4.28

Vin Deisel using the safe as a bowling ball to demolish an entire squadron of police cars was a joke as is pretty much the entire plot ... The film lacks any emotional depth and there is very little reason to care about the mission of the characters.  However, it serves it's purpose in a sense, providing the excitement of cool action scenes, which is pretty much all big budget Hollywood films care about these days.  As long as the dumbed down audience sees explosions and car chases, it doesn't matter how far fetched the plot is and how the film is void of character arcs/changes in character.  Overall, it was entertaining, but at the same time, a slap in the face to the idea that films should at least be somewhat believable.",1454371200,,816,4.606896551724138

So I hadn't seen a single Fast & Furious movie prior to this. But I was browsing through Best Buy for my copies of other titles that came out that day when I saw the BB exclusive SteelBook edition. So for the first time in a while, I made a blind-buy based solely on the aforementioned packaging and the fact that The Rock was in it. I expected the preconceived notion that the other films had established (fast cars and hot girls), but was very surprised at how great of an action-heist-thriller this turned out to be. The story starts with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) being sentenced to prison (I'm guessing from F4), and then breaking out.

The movie had plenty of action, plenty of thrills and frankly I liked the plot line as well, which sometimes these movies don't have a plot.

After the third one moved away from the original cast and the fourth one (IMO) sucked so badly, I didn't have high hopes for this movie.

Luckily, I was proven wrong - in spades.  This movie was outstanding!  The addition of the Rock was a great move.  That guy has a definite screen presence and brings the testosterone to a whole new level.  Watching him and Dom duke it out was excellent.

The story brought most of the original cast back together, which was nice for nostalgia.  Fast cars are, of course, involved - but they aren't such a dominating focus like in the first movie.  I thought it was well written, well produced, and well acted.

If you liked the first one, or if you just like action movies in general, I highly recommend it.",1431734400,4,943,4.430232558139535

Read reviews for the other shows and chose to skip 2-4 ( to stick with the original cast, mostly ) Everything about the cars was great: fun. Spectacular racing scenes. What I didn't care for was the grungy theme. There's really nothing redeeming about these characters. They're criminals who bring down other characters to their grungy level as each film progresses. Disappointing as I was looking forward to having a new stock of movies to watch.

4357395,1,B004EPYZQC,"This is the film that really put the final nail in the coffin for the franchise. Honestly all realism is lost to the story when you bring in someone like The Rock as a main cast member but this story is just over the top and ridiculous to the max! The first one was a classic then next 2 films were just ok. The 4th was rushed and had allot of shark jumping(underground tunnel chase) but this blew the credibility of his franchise to pieces. Now with ""Furious"" 6 and 7 it got even worse. And no I am not a hater I actually find the actors likable (Walker, Vin, etc). I wanted to like this but I cant because its become so ridiculous. This is not a story that could be possible in real life no realism whatsoever.",1428364800,2,712,4.129496402877698

4357606,5,B004EPYZQC,"It's really incredible how this series turned around so drastically in the 5th film, Fast Five. This film received critical acclaim and a lot of box office revenue, both of which are first's for this series. This was like a rebirth, without having to re-do anything. That's the part that's so incredible, this film is by the same writer and the same director as the last two films and the same producer as the first four films. Nothing changed, which really makes it all the more impressive that this film scored 50 points higher than the last one on rotten tomatoes and that the film's box office gross was 3/4 of what the first four movies made COMBINED.
Anyway, after being framed for the murders of three DEA agents that they did not commit; Don(Vin Diesel), Brian(Paul Walker) and Mia gather up all their old friends and allies from all different corners of the first four films, and bring them together as a team in Rio de Janeiro to do one last job: steal $100 million from the man who set them up and is running all the crime in Rio, all the while being pursued by a relentless federal agent: Luke Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson).
This film is a lot better than the already pretty good first four films. It introduces two things that really bring the series to the next level. The first is: Humor. While it's four predecessors were so serious and had little to no humor, this film was hilarious.
The second is: a sheer and genuine sense of fun. Again with first four being so serious, this movie is so much fun, arguably the most fun I've ever had in the theater.
It's so refreshing to have a Fast and Furious film that focuses on the characters more than the cars. There's very little focus on cars at all in this film, a first for the series. Thank God.
I'm sure most people wish the series could have just started here, which I can understand, but if it did, I don't think we would have appreciated it as much.
This film takes at least one character from each of the first four films and brings them together as a team(like a pre courser to The Avenger) and it was so cool and so much fun to see them all working together. It's a lot like a crossover movie.
Also, I was completely unaware that this film was going to be an all out heist movie. That was another pleasant surprise.
Honestly, this film is so great and so much fun and is absolutely the best film in the series to date. I walked into that theater as a moderate fan of the series and walked out as a die-hard fan for life.",1427932800,3,2485,4.346236559139785

4359359,4,B004EPYZQC,"FAST FIVE opens with what has to be the most preposterous prison break in the history of movies. I just couldn't help but laugh at the absolute absurdity of it. Its a neat action scene that gets this movie off to a good start. If you remember the ending of FAST & FURIOUS Dominick Toretto (Vin Diesel) decided to turn himself in. Federal Agent Brian OConnor (the late Paul Walker), and Doms sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) tried to obtain clemency for him in court but the judge sentenced him to Lompoc Federal Prison. And if you can remember the original FAST & THE FURIOUS movie Dominick told Brian, Ill die before I go back. Thus, I suppose the prison break was inevitable.

Dom, Brian, and Mia are now the focus of a nationwide manhunt, but they have split up. Mia and Brian drive into the favela area of Rio de Janeiro where they hook up with Doms best friend Vince (Matt Shultz). Its the first time they saw each other, and apparently Vince isn't too wild about seeing Brian again, even though he knows the former agent is wanted like all of them. Vince has a real gratitude problem as he blames Brian for what happened in L.A, forgetting that he was the one that saved his life in the first film. Vince tells him about a job he has lined up. Some high-end cars and they can get some easy money. Brian agrees and arrangements are made.

But what nobody counts on is the one who is actually organizing the job, which turns out not only to be dangerous but rather impractical. Three rare sports cars are being transported on a train out in the deserts. One of them is a Ford GT40. And the vehicles were seized by the DEA.  Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince have teamed up with Zizi (Michael Irby), who put together some locals for them. They drive a custom vehicle with a flatbed on the side, cut open the side of the train car, and transport each car from the train to the flatbed, which lowers down to the dirt so that the vehicle can be taken away. But Dom senses something wrong after the first car is taken and tells Mia, driving the second car, to change their plans. She drives off in the GT40 in a different direction and thats when everything goes wrong. Zizi and the other locals try to kill Dom and Brian but they manage to fight them off. During the chaos, Zizi kills three DEA agents.

Dom, Brian, and Mia know that Zizi wanted that particular car. The owner is a drug lord who has the city of Rio in his pocket: Reyes (Joaquin di-Almedia). On top of that, they're blamed for the killing of those three agents, putting them at the top of the FBI Ten-Most-Wanted list. In comes Luke Hobbes (Dwayne Johnson) of the Diplomatic Security Service. Hobbes and his team specialize in finding people the FBI is looking for. And for Luke, he doesnt care what somebody has done or even if they're innocent. Im just here to bring two men that came to my desk. He asks for an assistant: a local patrol officer Elina (Elysa Pataky) because she is the only honest cop in Rio.

Dom and the other two find a custom chip in the car with all the locations of Reyes cash houses totaling $100 million in drug money. He comes up with a brainstorm with Brian: take all of that money and buy their freedom. Brian knows that they will have to put together a team and they do. In come characters from all four of the previous FAST/FURIOUS movies: Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson), Han (Sung Kang), Giselle (Cal Gadot), Lego/Santos (Don Omar/Teg Calderon), and Parker (Chris Ludacris Bridges). Each one has a specialty and is called on to do a different job, from explosives to weapons, circuits, and a smart mouth. Unlike so many other action movies the characters in FAST FIVE are actually interesting, although not entirely three-dimensional.

They come up with a way to get the money consolidated into one location and a plan to steal all that money from that location. At the same time they have to deal with Hobbs, which leads to a fight scene between Johnson and Diesel. Ive been waiting for years to see the two of them go at it, and the fight is well made, not to mention really brutal.

What they come up with to steal that $100 million in the films climax is dangerous, and just as preposterous as the opening prison break. I won't spoil the fun by describing it but state that FAST FIVE follows a tradition in all of the previous films. It actually relies on real stuntmen driving real cars. Some CGI is obviously used but it doesnt draw attention to itself. Everything actually looks real in this film. In addition, FAST FIVE is the first film of the series that steers away from the street racing that it all started from back in 2001. Its a heist movie, and that change lead to the next film that came out. And unlike the Michael Bay movies like TRANSFORMERS, the action can be followed.

There is a scene where Dom tells Brian about his father. If you remember the first film he talked about how he lost his life. Here, he explains the kind of person he remembered him for. It is one of the best scenes in the movie that elevates it to more than just a non-stop action film.

Watch the special ending at the end of the movie. If you have followed the series and have not seen the sixth film it will surprise you. It clearly sets up FAST & FURIOUS SIX.

Watching this film  you cant help but remember how tragic it was that Paul Walker lost his life in November, 2013. Yes, he will best be remembered for the FAST & THE FURIOUS movies, but he demonstrated that he was a good actor in movies like JOYRIDE, EIGHT BELOW, RUNNING SCARED, and the last one he finished before his death: BRICK MANSIONS",1402531200,,5587,4.398838334946757

4359522,5,B004EPYZQC,"They got a lot right with Fast Five, it's more Italian Job than the others and that really works because the cast is a lot of fun and they look like they are having more fun. The end scene with the safe is a blast and one of the better action sequences if you like seeing some 'car'nage. This is the game changer for me and the series, I'm able to go back and enjoy the previous films even more now as I was never a fan of the first two and the third was strangely entertaining. the 4th showed promise and this one is the payoff.",1402272000,,529,3.953271028037383
4359523,5,B004EPYZQC,This has become one of my all-time favorite movies. VIN Diesel is a man of action by him self and when you put him with Dwayne Johnson and Paul Walker the action keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat! So far I have the first. 6 and I am waiting for the next one #7. I will be coming back to Amazon for my company! THANK YOU!,1401753600,,329,3.782608695652174

4359525,5,B004EPYZQC,Who doesn't love to watch Vin Diesel! I love this series but I don't know if it's more for the action or more to watch Vin. I would recommend the whole series!,1401148800,,159,4.0
4359526,5,B004EPYZQC,"You've just been served proof of the opposite. The action and the intensity are amazing, Dwayne demonstrates that is he is still the most electrifying man in action packed entertainment alongside Vin Diesel and it works. These are two guys who play very well off of each other with an nice adversarial edge thrown in. Add the usual suspects plus a few more familiar faces and WOW!!! What a tour de force you are left grinning at.",1401062400,,429,4.584415584415584
4359527,5,B004EPYZQC,Fast Five goes right in there with all of the rest. I enjoyed it but I have to admit it was a little hard for me to watch because I got it after Paul wall killed untimely. I will watch it with all of the rest over and over again.,1400112000,,229,3.6

4359612,5,B004EPYZQC,"This is just a great continuation of a strong franchise.  The story is enough different to be interesting.  Special effects and stunts are odd enough to be unique.  It IS a car movie -- so you have to like that to start.  But, if you do -- great ""good boy / bad boy / good girl / bad girl"" dynamics",1398902400,,298,3.9166666666666665

4359620,5,B004EPYZQC,"This movie is definitely the best movie of the FAF franchise.  It brought back all of the best characters from all of the movies and added a great story.  The previous movies were mostly about the cars and the action sequences, and this movie has that, but it also has a great story and the action revolves around that, not the other way around.  I really loved this movie and it restored my faith in this franchise after the dissapointment of the previous two movies.  The success of this movie has prompted two more to be made and only one has come out so far but it was not as good, and the one left might be the last after the death of Paul Walker, May he RIP.  Fair warning though, if you haven't seen the previous movies you will be confused so my recommendation is to watch them first.",1397606400,,792,4.253333333333333

Vin Diesel?  Loved him from the first and love him still.  If he's in a movie, I'm gonna watch it!  And the rest of the cast adds so much intrigue and fun.  Adding Dwayne Johnson to the mix was a pleasant surprise.  Lastly....I love movies about fast cars, heists, the sorta bad guys getting away with it.",1395273600,,480,4.197802197802198

4359919,5,B004EPYZQC,"I have seen all the Fast and Furious movies (including #6) and Fast Five is the best, hands down.  Furious 6 (or whatever other of its titles you prefer) has the most mind-blowing action.  The Fast and the Furious, well, it is always hard to top the original.  Fast Five, put simply, is the best of both worlds, or maybe, it comes down to the big brawl between Dobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Toretto (Vin Diesel).

What it really comes down to, is family.  Cliche as it may be, of all the films (even #6), Fast Five dives into the realm of family, friends, and togetherness.  Brian, Mia, and Dominic come closer than ever before, and the stakes feel higher knowing that the family is about to expand with the announcement that Mia is pregnant (yes, in the end this is really a somewhat mindless action movie, but if you have followed these movies from the beginning, you begin to feel for these characters).

The ""family"" doesn't end there, as Fast Five brings together most of the gang from the previous films - Vince (The Fast and the Furious), Roman &Tej (2 Fast 2 Furious), Han (Tokyo Drift and Fast and Furious) and Gisele, Tego and Rico (Fast and Furious).

The action is some of the best in the series (excluding Furious 6 perhaps), Including a train robbery, the forementioned throwdown between Toretto and Hobbs, and the over the top but all too fun bank robbery conclusion.  The best scene in any of the current 6 films is in Fast Five.  Dominic and Brian drive a car right off a huge cliff into the river below.  The directing of this scene is convincing enough to make the viewer feel as though he/she is falling off the cliff as well.

These movies come down to one thing - fun at the movies - and Fast Five guarantees that.  While it never takes itself too seriously, there is a deeper sense of family and friends with Fast Five.  Maybe the average viewer won't care, but after watching all these films from the beginning, it just might take a hold of you.",1392508800,,1966,4.455307262569832
4359920,4,B004EPYZQC,"Great movie.  Maybe not a classic amongst all classics, but a very good action movie for a range of audiences.  My wife and two young/middle age boys liked it along with me.",1392422400,,173,4.375

My heart goes out to the families of both victims. I do plan on owning the Fast and Furious collection so that I can have them whenever, I want to see his face. And God bless Meadow, it's sad for any child to lose a parent. RIP~Paul Walker",1388966400,,413,3.9879518072289155

4360765,5,B004EPYZQC,"OMG!!! Truly STUPID and OUTRAGOUS!!! About 90% of this is totally impossible and unbelievable, but just plain STUPID!!! From the acting skills to EXTENDED love for LETTUS and all those LONG FACE SHOTS for her stupid looks. True the movie SUCKED!!! All of them SUCKED, but I watched them all because I am a car guy and do it for a living. I watch them to see how dumb the actors are and how they get the mechanics WRONG, and laugh like hell. How did you like the No2 NOS bottle on the dam spear gun, like it was going to super-charge the spear gun like it does the cars? LOLOLOL.....STUPID. I think of these movies like the old ""VERN GOES TO COLLEGE"" movies of the eighties. I do believe Tom that when you said about ridding these guys, you should have said ""all of you should get on your knees like a rat eating cheese"" because that is how Hollywood has given it to all of us with these bull-crap movies, right up the old giggy pipe from behind. I still watched them and I will for sure watch the last one, as I am sure it will  e the last one because of walkers death (hated that). This is when and why 7 should end this mess.  Ludacris should NEVER be in a film again, of that other black fool, who acts like a monkey that he is.....Enjoy Tim, your right and they suck but I can't wait to see the last one, there too stupid....",1386979200,,1329,4.147286821705427

4360975,4,B004EPYZQC,"This is a little bit of a guilty pleasure for me. The best way for me to describe Fast Five is as the spiritual successor to all those great 80's action movies, it's over the top, the heroes can do no wrong, and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. What separates it from a lot of other big action movies is that it knows it's just about being fun, and as a result is able to deliver on being big and dumb and entertaining.

Part of what made this movie such a success was the introduction of the Rock's character Hobbs. This was the movie that really cemented the Rock as a big time action hero and franchise saver. If you enjoyed his other movies, like G.I.Joe Retaliation, this is the definitive Rock action movie, even though he isn't the lead. If you're like me, you'll probably be a little embarrassed by how much you'll like the movie, but it's so much fun it's hard not to enjoy it.",1385769600,,898,4.2823529411764705

It was our favorite, although we enjoyed all the movies.

Beautiful shots of Rio de Janeiro. Fantastic train robbery. The story was good - it wasn't just car racing but had a solid good guy/bad guy/$100 million dollar robbery in it.  Loved the vault chase - wow!

My only complaint is no closed captioning on #5. I am partially deaf and it makes a big difference to me in the watching/listening experience. Lots of accents which were hard to understand.",1385164800,,801,6.133928571428571
4361048,5,B004EPYZQC,Paul Walker is just so delicious. I have been in love with him from Pleasantville era. The Fast and the Furios series minus Tokoyo Drift are one of my favorites.

4361052,4,B004EPYZQC,"This movie in the series of 6 (which I have not seen) seems to be a little more developed than the others.  They give you some storyline, some sentiment and romance, and the car action as well (even though it seems rather ridiculous to go racing for a car in a foreign country while being chased by police who should know the area well enough to catch them). Never-the-less, I always enjoy looking at Paul Walker, The Rock and Vin Deisel--a triple treat!

A little harsh for young families, and grandma, (unless she is Ma Barker type), probably will not like it. The men will either say it is OK or great. I can't see the girlfriend or wife loving this, but Vin Diesel gives a good solid performance and is easy on the eyes.",1382486400,,418,4.371794871794871

4361138,4,B004EPYZQC,I paid for this movie on a Friday night and it was show on TBS on Saturday. I think it needs to be moved to the free list for Amazon Prime,1381708800,,138,3.4838709677419355
4361139,4,B004EPYZQC,"And here I was thinking that a movie couldn't be more silly and unbelievable than Fast 6. I was wrong. That movie is Fast 5, and it embraces it's stupidity and turns it into a highly entertaining and explosive action picture.

How did director James Lin do it? He did away with the street-racing angle, played up the chemistry between the impressively buff and gruff Vin Diesel and his crew, and added more bikinis, six-packs, and shiny sports cars. Oh, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dwayne-The-Rock-Johnson/dp/B0088WJV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson</a>, who is like franchise viagra (No really: Journey, GI Joe, Fast and Furious, Brett Ratner's career), and looking here like he is made out of actual, chocolate-coloured, extremely charismatic rock.

Lin took the franchise away from the US, and set it in the colorful land of ""BrraZEEL!"", here represented as a party-filled, gangster-ruled, corrupt, street-racing, hot girl-populated tropical paradise. He made the action scenes unbelievably fast (and furious) and silly, the villains deliciously evil, the Rock so incredibly testosterone-oozing, and kept the plot sweet and simple.

This is an action movie running on the simplest, cleanest action movie bones. This is formula to the max - workable, reliable formula. This is a man's movie to the max: fast cars, fast women, fast guns, explosions, biceps, bullets. And the Rock.

If you are looking for a smart, brilliantly acted, unforgettable action movie, seek out Heat or Hard Boiled. Avoid this if you are A. looking for a smart thriller. B. Have sensitive eardrums. C. Want to watch something stimulating.

 Much like the shiny cars it often treats like battering rams, Fast 5 is loud, fast, occasionally clunky, shiny on the outside, extremely workable on the inside, and a great ride. And that's high praise for an action movie.
This is the best of the Fast and Furious franchise; a worthy showcase of the charisma and bear-growling of its star,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vin-Diesel/dp/B00A2H9OZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vin Diesel</a>, fine cinematography, explosive action, cool one-liners, and some excellent car racing/chasing scenes.

It's just a series of stunts that would never happen that way in real life mixed with fake fighting scenes.  I've seen enough of these I can't be impressed watching the stunts, I just think this is stupid. I used to dislike James Bond because everything was fake but it's more real than this.

4361658,4,B004EPYZQC,"You must suspend your belief of reality in order to appreciate this movie... Not only for the 'tricks' that are pulled in chases etc but also the acting, mainly Paul walker, who plays 'Paul walker' in every movie he's in.
Overall if you like the series you will enjoy this one. The next one is even better. I would rank them like this:
1. First (it's the original)
2. 6th movie in the series good story line for the series worth watching
3. 5th better acting decent story line
4. 2nd brought in new characters and clever play
5. 4th not memorable but not so horrible it was
6. 3rd Tokyo drift is the movie FF fans thought never should have existed. Almost completely tanked the series and to be honest, after reading reviews, I didn't watch it.

Bottom line watch the others and make sure to grab this one.",1371168000,,806,4.373333333333333

4361778,4,B004EPYZQC,"This review is not about the movie, which I enjoyed enough to purchase the disc.

I purchased this version specifically for the Digital Copy that came with it.  I was looking forward to watching it on my 30"" Apple Cinema Display, only when I got it downloaded, I found out that it is only compatible with HDCP compliant monitors, which the cinema display is not.  No where on the packaging did it mention this restriction, nor did it warn me when I downloaded the movie either.  Very disappointed.  This kind of BS is what makes people pirate the movies.

FOLLOWUP: 7/7/13 - I contacted Universal and complained about the inability to do this.  The got back to me very quickly with an answer on how to download a SD copy of the movie.  Apparently in iTunes, it defaults to download the HD version, and for some companies, they enable the HDCP-only protection.  But the SD version isn't protected.  Apple doesn't let you know that there is an alternate SD version you can get that you can view instead.  So kudos to Universal for providing an easy mechanism for downloading their movies, but it would have been nice to have known I needed to make sure I got the SD version also.",1370390400,,1177,4.530805687203792

4361846,4,B004EPYZQC,"Like all Fast and Furious movies, Fast Five involved lots of stealing fast cars, driving fast cars, shooting, fighting, explosions, etc. If you like cars and over-the-top action movies then you'll probably like this movie. There is a lot of violence but it's not the gory violence you see in a movie like Rambo - just lots of shooting and explosions. Also, there is some profanity but very little sexual content.

The acting is average, and some of Vin Diesels are a little cheesy, but overall it's pretty good. We like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, so putting them together in the same movie is a win. The fight scene is great, and I lost track of the number of walls they punched through.

I would recommend seeing this movie at least once, but probably won't own it. I liked Vin Diesel a lot better in The Pacifier (yeah I know I'll get flamed for that comment), and I liked Dwayne Johnson better in The RunDown.",1370217600,,921,4.508982035928144

4361892,5,B004EPYZQC,"I thought the F&F franchise was for guys who drink NOS, drown themselves in AXE body spray, and put Type R badges on whatever car they happen to be driving.  I was also turned off by the trailers - as far as I knew, these movies were just two-hour long rap videos with rice boys and ghetto booties.

I was laid up sick and happened to catch ""Fast & Furious"" on TV.  I was hooked from the tanker scene and it went from there.

Fast Five is even bigger.  It continues the franchise's utter contempt for Sir Isaac Newton and you get to see cars doing impossible things like dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio de Janeiro and people jumping from great heights without so much as sprained ankles.

Comic relief comes from Leo and Santos.  Their near-constant bilingual bickering is funny to listen to and watch.  The back-and-forths between Tej and Roman aren't as funny but at least stay firmly planted in English.

There's tons of action and a party wouldn't be a party without Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson playing an intense and musclebound lawman.  You can imagine his character's hobbies would include beating people up and finding ways to make handcuffs more uncomfortable.  The Rock is just likeable.  He could be shown punching nuns and little kids and you'd cheer.

Poor Brian.  He's proven his worth and loyalty and even after changing hemispheres and being Mia's boyfriend he still has to put up with being called ""buster.""

I do have some questions though.

1. How did Dom get his Charger all the way to Rio?
2. What would Tej have done had his remote control camera car landed upside down?
3. Where were all those favela tough guys when Zizi and his crew were shooting the place up?
4. What if the roulette ball didn't land on green?

The end sequence is fun because everyone has seemingly forgotten the millions of dollars of damage done, the scores of people either killed or injured, and the serious diplomatic issues that no doubt sprang up between the United States and Brazil.

I HAVE NOW SEEN FF6....can't believe it toped Fast Five, but somehow they just keep building the suspense of these films and leave you hungry for more at the end.

4362119,4,B004EPYZQC,"""Fast Five"" is an action movie that is bigger and louder than any of the Fast and the Furious franchise, with most of the principal characters returning, including Vin Diesel's Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto and Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner. Mostly set in Rio de Janeiro, the fifth installment is no longer about street racing, with action sequences including a daring train heist and a rooftop chase.

In the film Dom and Brian, wrongly accused of killing DEA agents, are pursued by Dwayne Johnson's determined DSS agent Luke Hobbs. In the meanwhile, Dom and the gang plan to steal money from a corrupt businessman, Joaquim de Almeida's Hernan Reyes. The story doesn't make much sense, with a dialogue-heavy mid-section that attempts to give each character depth, which I found boring.

In spite of the great action set-pieces and exotic locations, the film occasionally feels drawn-out. Action-wise, ""Fast Five"" delivers the goods, an enjoyable ride with a rousing (and some say, ridiculous) climax car chase scene, but more action and less speech would be welcome for the next time.",1368748800,,1076,5.107954545454546

4362123,5,B004EPYZQC,"Fast Five is without a doubt the best film is the Fast franchise.  I enjoyed the Fast and The Furious as a popcorn film.  I did not care for either 2 Fast 2 Furious or Tokyo Drift.  I thought Fast and Furious was a step up from the previous films.  However, Fast Five is on a whole other level.

The story takes place right where Fast and Furious left off.  Brian O'Connor and his Mia break Toretto out of prison and are now labeled as wanted criminals.  In response a Special Forces team lead by Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) are sent to bring them in.  Toretto and Brian gather a team to pull of one final job, and then disappear for good.

The characters are the best aspect about the film.  Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reprise their roles here.  I think they turn their best performances here.  Jordana Brewster returns as Mia.  She does a good job with what she is given.  The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) gives his best performance in a long time in this movie.  To me this is the Rock's return to action movies not Faster.

All the other cast members from the previous films return here.  Tyrese Gibson comes back as Roman Pierce.  I did not care for Gibson in 2 Fast 2 Furious, but I do not mind him here as much.  This is probably because he is a supporting character in this film, and not a main character that has to carry the film.  Ludacris (Tej) and Sung Kang (Han) return as well.  I never cared about those characters but they did fine in this movie.  Gisele, played by Gal Gadot comes back too.  She had a small role in Fast and Furious that is not even worth noting.  However, I thought her character was awesome here.  The character of Vincent is back from the first movie as well.  I did not like his character at all in Fast and the Furious, and I did not care for him here either.  He is one of the only characters that I did not like in this film.  I loved seeing the cast of all the Fast films together.  The interacting they all have with each other is great and very fun.

The villain, I will say is weak.  That should not be a surprise at this point.  The Fast films have always had weak villains.  Though, I will, say, this villain is one of the stronger villains of the franchise, though that is not saying much.

The action is top-notch!  The action scenes trump anything in the other Fast films.  The action is different than the other films too.  It focuses less on races (though there are some) and more on fist fight, fire fights, car chases, etc.  This film is more of a heist movie than a racing movie.  The effects for the film are also top of the line, and better than all of the other movies.  The ending scene alone is worth seeing the movie for.

Overall this is a must watch for all who are fans of this franchise.  This is easily the best Fast film in almost every category whether it is characters, story, action, effects, etc.",1368403200,,2856,4.242085661080075

4362270,4,B004EPYZQC,"Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.

Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.

Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of ""Desperado"" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.

What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.

Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious ""Danza Kuduro"" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.

There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.

The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.

That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.

Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.

Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.",1364947200,,4272,4.83972602739726

4362397,5,B004EPYZQC,"When I was younger I really loved this franchise. I watched the first two films many many times. As I got older I fell away from them. When the trailer for Fast 5 came out I was very intrigued at how fun it looked. My friend and I decided to marathon the previous 4 before going to the theater. It was not like i remembered. The first one was alright but the rest were pretty awful imo. Fast and Furious (4th film) was incredibly bad and since it was the same director working on Fast 5 our expectations dropped. We almost decided not to go. But the film started to get positive buzz so we decided to go. One of the best decisions I have ever made. I was blown and extremely shocked by how FUN this movie is! The action is so thrilling and feels so real due to practical effects and stunts. One of the rare films these days to provide an old school type of action film with actors younger than 60. Shootouts, car chases, and hand to hand brawls that will leave you breathless. Highly Highly recommended.",1360022400,,1003,4.2565445026178015

4362585,3,B004EPYZQC,"The popular franchise continues though this is the first of the bunch I have seen and critics say it's the best of the current five.

Tale focuses on a team of criminals who break out their leader, played by Vin Diesel, and then escape to Rio. During a car heist on a train which defies the laws of physics at time they stumble upon something bigger which puts them deeper into the criminal underbelly. Enter the DEA agent played by Dwayne Johnson.

Overall, I was more impressed with the action scenes and cinematography and found the story and characters hit or miss at times though I did like the bait and switch move at the very end and the reaction of the DEA character played by Dwayne Johnson, who played an edgy, buffed out no nonsense style character who still had a sense of humor.

The action scenes in the latter half are so many at times in the tale that it felt like it diluted the overall story. That said, let me reiterate the action scenes were borderline awesome at times and the shots of Rio from above as well as the city made me want to visit. There's enough quality in the picture for me to probably check out the earlier films.

This film was partly filmed in Rio. The budget was $125M and it made over $626M at the Box Office. Watch for the teaser scene after the credits.

CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus;  STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus to B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus to B; ACTION SCENES: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early December 2012 (extended cut); OVERALL GRADE: B.",1354579200,,1518,4.501818181818182

4362590,4,B004EPYZQC,"Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.

Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.

Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of ""Desperado"" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.

What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.

Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious ""Danza Kuduro"" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.

There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.

The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.

That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.

Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.

Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Steelbook Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.",1354233600,,4282,4.845417236662107

While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.

Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series.

The Rock, to me, stole the show.  His kick-ass take no prisoners until the job is done mentally is GREAT.  The ending after the credits is a must see and leaves you with more questions than answers.

And how when the bad guys catch them and cuff them to the ceiling Vin Diesal easily breaks out of the cuffs and pounds the dudes to a pulp! Hmm yeah right?

4362663,4,B004EPYZQC,"Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.

Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.

Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of ""Desperado"" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.

What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.

Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious ""Danza Kuduro"" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.

There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.

The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.

That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.

Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours.

4362666,5,B004EPYZQC,"** MINOR PLOT SYNOPSIS (MINUS ENDING)**

Vin Diesel is busted out of prison and is reunited with his sister Jordana Brewster (who I fell in love with in D.E.B.S.) and her bf Paul Walker in Rio, the most recognized skyline in the world. They are bad guys stealing cars off a train. As things turned out, these were cars seized by the Brazilian DEA, who for some reason unlike their American counterparts don't disable the vehicles. Due to infighting, the effort is partially botched and Vin Diesel and Walker end up as captives of a Rio mobster. They discover he wants one of the cars back real bad. After they escape they dismantle the car to find out way.

Meanwhile Dwayne Johnson comes down from the US to take back Vin Diesel. It seems the US has jurisdiction in Brazil, but hey its a movie. From a chip in the vehicle, Vin Diesel discovers that the crime boss has money stored in various cash houses throughout the city. Walker and Vin Diesel assemble a Mission Impossible team to go after the cash. They attack the first cash house and burn the money which forces the mobster to relocate all his eggs into one basket. As it turns out, that basket is inside the evidence safe at the police station, making the task of that one last hit a bit more difficult. At this point the movie takes a few interesting twists and turns.

The plot contains numerous implausibilities as does most Mission Impossible action movies, vehicles that can bust through concrete walls (that never use rebar), and don't even scratch the head lights. The ending will keep Myth Busters busy for a season.",1345161600,,1583,4.586572438162544

4362669,3,B004EPYZQC,"This review is just about the Blu-ray disc itself. For me this is an excruciating poor BD to navigate.
I have an older Panasonic BD30 player, and I realize that that might make things extra slow for me.
But this disc is slow to load and as happens on Blu-ray Discs at their worst, I pay a steep penalty for watching a feature on the extras menu - at the end of every feature I have to wait what seems like a really long time for the disc to return me the the previous menu. Also, pausing the disc too long puts me into some sort of Universal wallpaper that offers no clue as to how to get back to where I was. It was trial and error to find a remote sequence that worked, and in one case I just had to power down/power up the player to get off this screen. Super annoying, and I know this can be part of BDs in general bit this disc is as bad as I've seen in that regard.
There is a lot of interesting extra content to watch, but the super-annoying BD process wastes a lot of time in between them. Sometimes I like to browse these or skim them to see if they are interesting to me. Or if I'm short on time, power watch the extras.

""Fast Five,"" so named because it is the fifth entry in the highly lucrative ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, finds our intrepid band of car-racing criminals, played by Vin Diesel , Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, masterminding a heist against a South American crime lord played by Joaquim de Almeida .  Wayne Johnson joins the cast as an American Secret Service agent hot on the trio's trail.

Replete with wafer-thin characters, corny one-liners, substandard acting and muddled moral messaging, the movie culminates in a spectacular, though really rather ludicrous, car chase through the streets of Rio de Janeiro.  Strictly for aficionados of vroom-vroom storytelling.",1340841600,2,676,5.471153846153846
4362671,4,B004EPYZQC,"I have a real `love/hate' relationship with `The Fast and Furious' franchise.  I absolutely loved the original when I was like fifteen and still consider it one of the best films in its genre (thus, my five star review).  `2 Fast 2 Furious' was a tad overblown and nowhere near as fun without Vin Diesel.  Still, it had some great moments and I like it.  `Tokyo Drift' made no sense whatsoever and had none of the original cast, so it seemed wholly unnecessary and yet it was far more entertaining than the initial sequel and had a great star making turn (if you call this a `star making vehicle') by Lucas Black, so it was forgivable and certainly enjoyable.  `Fast & Furious' was cheap and ridiculous and a gross underachievement and a major disappointment.  It had almost no merit whatsoever.  After that bitter pill, I was ready to write off `Fast Five' before it was even released.  I mean, as much as I loved the original, do we really need five `Fast and Furious' movies (six now that the sixth film has been greenlit)?

Alas, I gave in to temptation (much like I did with that terrible `Transformers' movie) and found out that my expectations were surpassed, in a really good way.

The worst thing I can say about `Fast Five' is that it is too long.  The film itself is probably the best in the series, maybe even better than the original, but it needed to be edited slightly.  The ending just drags out, and it doesn't have the level of polish needed to justify an elongated story.  It is similar to 2006's `Casino Royale' in the way that it is expanded storywise, but `Casino Royale' justified it's extensions with sharp development.  `Fast Five' can't do that, because this story lacks the depth it wants to have.  It is fun, but it isn't particularly smart.

That said; every other element works really well here.  Having nearly every member from the original and sequels come together for this really big heist in Rio was pretty cool and helped aid in the nostalgic feel (it made me want to rewatch the original) and other aspects of the film really soar, like the crisp cinematography and the visual effects (that train sequence was FLAWLESS).  The acting is decent, Paul Walker still as wooden as ever, but this is Diesel's wheelhouse and so he does what he does better than The Rock.  Seriously, it's a shame that The Rock stole Vin Diesel's career.  It's funny to see them opposite each other.  They are basically the same person and yet Diesel's career, which seemed so promises, has pretty much dissolved and The Rock has arguably received every role Diesel could have and should have gotten.

It's fun and exciting and bold and sets us up for the third (sixth) installment that Diesel promises is going to be amazing.  I can't really see how they can take this any further since all five films so far have pretty much consisted of the SAME THING, but this one places all those elements in the best possible order.",1339372800,,2933,4.587332053742802

4362706,5,B004EPYZQC,"Not really being a fan of action films and only watching the third Fast/Furious movie, I wasn't too stoked about watching this in theaters (Big mistake) and instead only rented it recently, WOW!

The film just opens up with cars racing and busting Vin Diesel out of prison in the most unrealistic way possible, and leads to the characters hiding out in Rio evading the FBI and the army in Rio who are all after the main characters. It's like one big action scene after another, with little intervals of the guys snorting testosterone and yelling at each other to keep the plot moving along. Fast Five ain't no Citizen Kane that's for sure, but for an action film it's perfection. The characters all have good chemistry together, the Rock (or is it Dwayne now?) makes a good rival to Vin Diesel and every action scene was creative and not something I've normally seen before, especially the final chase scene.

Chances are you've probably already seen this, but Fast Five is one damn good action flick coming from someone who's not usually a fan of action films.",1336953600,,1061,4.668449197860962

The 5th installment was just too ridiculous even for the most vivid of imaginations. The gang of loveable lawbreakers were pretty much transformed into a squadron of super heroes who can take on any army...in this case, the Rio Police Department. The movie trailer has already shown us parts of the infamous action sequence where Diesel and Walker drive off a cliff, manage to seperate themselves from the car in mid air, and land unscathed in a lake (there should've been a pair shark fins protruding from the water, if ya' catch my drift.) I won't spoil the ending, but since when were those fast little cars known for their towing capabilities? Positive Notes: the stunts and CGI were exciting.

I've never been a fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but this movie won me over and then some. Sure, the dialogue's a bit hokey and the acting not exactly Oscar worthy, but that's not the point here. Those stunt sequences, especially the crazy chase that ends the film, are absolutely breathtaking.",1335484800,,457,4.654320987654321
4362711,5,B004EPYZQC,"The fast and the furious franchise has evolved, but some things stay the same: great racing/car scenes, interesting characters, ridiculous story lines, and some good action. With Fast Five, it has pushed the series to a whole new level, involving Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, a heist plot, and lots and lots of explosions.

During trailers, the showdown between Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Vin Diesel was hyped up and created a tantalizing matchup. The showdown lived up to its hype, as I enjoyed the constant tension, testosterone vs. testosterone. It was a pleasant on screen duo.

The one character I've always enjoyed is Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson). Admist all of the action and tension, he always manages to provide some comedic relief.

4362827,5,B004EPYZQC,"In regards to the radical driving off a huge cliff scene.  I recently learned that it was popular for men to try to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge when it was first constructed. Survival from this jump was pretty dicey. Some guys made it and some didn't. The first guy to try it died when he hit the water 135 feet below. Others were knocked unconscious and had to be saved by boats in the water. One guy claimed to do it without anyone seeing him and then opened up a successful restaurant based on the fact that he jumped. So really with falls of that height it is going to be pretty much up to the individual.

With a 200 foot fall the likelihood of survival becomes even less but that's when you have to factor in who is falling in this movie. You're talking about Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Obviously they can handle it. Vin Diesel is a guy that can jump a motorcycle 40 feet into the air without even trying. Paul Walker is a determined man that won't let countless obstacles stop him from finding his dogs, you think a two hundred foot fall is going to stop him? Come on get serious.

4362910,5,B004EPYZQC,This movie is great if your a fan of cars or just a heist movie. The movie is worth the money if only to see Vin Diesel and The Rock in a full blown gorilla fight.,1331424000,,163,3.5555555555555554
4362911,4,B004EPYZQC,This was a good fast and furious movie. You should watch it. We thought it was one of the better ones in the series,1331424000,,115,3.8333333333333335
4362912,1,B004EPYZQC,"This is not a review of the movie. There are enough reviews already on Amazon to decide if you would like to see the actual movie or not. This is a review on the ""Extended Version"" of this movie. You would have to pay close attention to see where the movie was actually extended. It adds a few frames and  has slight differences that cause the movie to be about 70 seconds longer than the original and only slightly different in some scenes (different angles, etc.). This website shows the differences for each scene---- www (dot) movie-censorship (dot)com/report (dot) php?ID=149783 . It seems to me that the extended version doesn't add much that theatrical version doesn't already have and what is added doesn't seem to make it better.",1330905600,,738,4.765625

4362924,5,B004EPYZQC,I was not a fan of the Furious Five series. I thought it was another car movie and I did not want to see it. It since this went on sale I decided to get it and see what it was all about. I was shocked that it was not about a race and I can honestly say I really am glad and I can honestly say I am going to go back and watch these others. You should see it.,1329955200,,357,3.419753086419753
4362925,5,B004EPYZQC,"This was complete and utter escapist fantasy!

It didn't matter that parts of the plot were completely unbelievable.  It didn't even matter that there were no captions.

The parts of the scenery that featured the ocean and the countryside surrounding Rio were breathtaking!  Made me totally want to visit and see the ocean.  Guess that's going on my bucket list.  lol

I admit being shallow enough to *totally* enjoy the fight between Johnson and Diesel.  I'm sure it was choreographed all to hell, and yet it looked like they were having so much fun with each other.

Yes, I finished high school.  Yes, I'm older than twelve.  Yes, I'm even a girl.  Yes, I just adored this movie.  Not everything has to be a high-brow cinematic masterpiece.",1329264000,,742,4.748031496062992

I contacted Amazon and they promptly returned my money including shipping and even provide a return lapel at their expense. I was not happy with the disc but I am very pleased as to how I was treated by Amazon and I continue to purchase from them. I just wish that everyone treated their customers with the same level of customer satisfaction that Amazon does. They are a very reputable site and I am very pleased with them. I shop their site all of the time and just recently bought Richy Rich and two car alarm remotes and they were top notch products.,1326585600,,706,4.237037037037037

4362958,3,B004EPYZQC,"Fast Five is the latest in the action-driven, visually stunning, Fast and the Furious series. I would think it's the last installment, but these days I suppose anything is possible. It begins with brother and sister Dom and Mia Toretto (Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster) along with ex-law enforcement officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) as wanted fugitives on the move and in need of gainful, thought not legal, employment. Once they find a job and prove unsuccessful in performing it, they are now sought by a drug kingpin and faux philanthropist who contracted them in the first place.

  Rather than knuckle under or retreat, the trio decides to bankrupt their unscrupulous foe, and thereby render him powerless. For this they need help and that is the reason they bring any living associates they from the previous films that played a significant role. All the while their nemesis has informed the American authorities as to their location in an effort to spoil their plans. Enter The Rock, playing U.S. Marshal Luke Hobbs, with the unflinching assistance of the Rio police, who are paid agents of the aforementioned kingpin. In addition, Hobbs has a very rigid view of his responsibility for the larger portion of the film.

  Fast Five isn't anything its predecessors weren't. Save for a little misdirection at the end. It's about beautiful cars, beautiful women, and the occasional fistfight or shootout. In that regard it's a success.",1326499200,,1442,5.03781512605042
4362959,5,B004EPYZQC,This movie is awesome. Reuniting all the main characters from the franchise was a good idea. The action sequence is unbelievable,1326412800,,128,5.142857142857143
4362960,4,B004EPYZQC,"Slow to get going but after that.... lots of bullets, fast cars, screaming tires, car chases, explosions, car crashes.

4363005,5,B004EPYZQC,"My husband and I have enjoyed all the movies in the Fast & Furious series, but this one might just be our favorite. Timeline-wise, it falls after Fast & Furious (#4) but before Tokyo Drift (#3). In my opinion, it revived the series in a fun way and makes me look forward to more in the series. The stunts (while perhaps far-fetched) were done very believable, with little CGI, making the viewing experience very enjoyable. The storyline didn't bore you, and watching Vin Diesel fight the Rock was just plain fun! If you're not a fan of the other movies, you probably won't like this one. However, some friends of our had never seen any of them and watched this with us and now want to watch the whole series.",1325635200,,708,4.453846153846154

4363009,2,B004EPYZQC,"The movie itself is great. I'm a big fan of Fast and Furious movies... For this item (both theatrical and extended versions), I noticed that at one part of the movie (where Dom & Bryan are having conversation that they will do the final job and disappear forever), the film stopped at the part of Dom's line ""...forever"" with no sound and continued again.:-(( I watched this in the big screen and didn't notice that.",1325376000,,416,4.56
4363010,3,B004EPYZQC,"When the very first line uttered is internally inconsistent and utter nonsense it gives you a good idea what you're in for. The things people will see this for are well done, physics defying action pieces but there's never any real suspense because the whole thing is completely predictable - like a really expensive Roadrunner cartoon.

I heard that Dwayne Johnson put on thirty pounds of muscle for this role. I'm not sure why. The role doesn't require it. My guess is that he wanted to make sure he looked like a credible opponent for his fight with Vin Diesel, but he ended up looking like he could snap Vin in half without trying so the fight lost credibility anyway.",1325376000,,672,4.6

4363054,2,B004EPYZQC,"I don't know why so many people like this movie. Sure it had cool cars but that alone doesn't make it a good movie. I thought it was boring. I usually like Dwayne Johnson but I just didn't like him in this movie. I didn't really care for any of the characters except for Han. He's the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. Maybe If I was a guy or if I was into racing,I would've like it better. This movie was to long and I was glad when it was over.",1325116800,,464,3.7938144329896906
4363055,5,B004EPYZQC,"If you like the other ""fast and furious"" flicks this one won't dissapoint. Start to finish it has action and edge of your seat suspense. Some of the old characters are back with some new alliances so spend the money and enjoy!",1325116800,,226,4.404761904761905
4363056,2,B004EPYZQC,"It was an entertaining movie and I'd watch it again, because of the action.  I found the dialog to be a bit corny and some of the behavior unnecessary (you found the hideout and they're on satellite.

4363274,5,B004EPYZQC,"When I first saw its trailer in the theatre, I thought it's going to be another bad sequel. How wrong I was! I have watched Fast Five both in the theatre and at home. Every time, I was absolutely entertained. That's the feeling I haven't got for a long time after watching action films.

The excitement is non-stop from the beginning till the end. I'm sorry, I can't go into details here. Otherwise, it will ruin your excitement.

The special effects with cars are the best that I've ever seen so far. Especially,  in the last scene where 2 cars pulled the vault into the street. Of course, I had to suppress my logic to enjoy the movie. If you like action scenes with cars, you don't want to miss this one.

In short, this is the best of all action sequences. It's also one of the BEST that my MONEY CAN GET. I own a DVD copy of it.",1323907200,2,833,4.1875
4363275,1,B004EPYZQC,"I left after half way through this movie. Why is everyone scream and fighting each other in this movie? It was like going into a bad high school or a jail cell. Stealing cars and hiding them? Yah right, I'm pretty sure these low-life characters can get away with that. And what chick wouldn't want to get knocked-up by some guy who steals cars for a living, not to mention constantly getting chased by the authority and the Latino ""mafia"". This is like the Latino Jersey Shore with fast cars. By the way, you combine Brian O'Conner and the Rock character to get the Vin Diesel character. They were all like cry-babies, always dramatizing the situation, no wonder they couldn't get anywhere in life. 1 star because I cannot give it 0 star. I will put on another star because I like fast car, but take off another star because American cars are ugly. So there you have it 1 star for this lovely movie. Save your money, if you want to see fast cars just Youtube it lol.",1323820800,5,966,4.402234636871508

4363330,5,B004EPYZQC,"Fast Five is easily the best of the F&TF series, bringing back almost the entire original cast with an all new storyline, featuring our anti-heroes Paul Walker, Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster as wanted criminals in the middle of Central America, and Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and the rest of his crew seeking them out. What makes this movie different from all the others is that the cars are actually NOT the stars of the film. No, this one puts the characters in the forefront, and does so with enough heart-pumping action to keep you invigorated throughout the entire film, including it's teaser ending that feature a cameo by an actress from the 2nd F&F movie, not to mention also hinting at another sequel in a cute and creative way.
Everything from the films fast-paced action, brilliant editing, and ear-blasting sound mix make for one of the better action movies to be released in the last 5 to 10 years (sadly, the gun-toting action guy-movie genre has been in very minimal demand due to a stupid influx of cheesy redundant romantic comedies, recycled CGI kids movies and hippie stoner flicks that continuously have been released in the last decade). With a little more of an edge, Fast Five could have easily hit an R-rating, therefore making this one at the borderline PG-13 area, similar to The Dark Knight.
The great part about characterization is that, unlike the first film, the two can't really be compared, thus leaving this one completely independent in and of itself, and some of the action is so intense and well choreographed, with completely minimal use of CGI (thank God!) so everything simply feels more real and intense, despite that lots of it is pretty far-fetched. But just like those old exciting 80's and 90's guy flicks, we don't watch them for their realism.

What's an extra added bonus is that with this package we get the theatrical and extended edition (granted the extended is only about 1 minute longer), and a digital copy where you can also put the extra bonus features as well as the feature presentation.

That said, this one's highly recommended, easily.",1322697600,,2097,4.822222222222222

There is very little racing, and one scene of drifting. Fast Five is my favorite of the movies because it had plot beyond racing. It had the best characters from the four previous movies (even Tokyo Drift) and it incorporated a heist. I love a good heist. The chase scene at the end of the movie is awesome, in my opinion. A lot of stunts were unbelievable, but it's a movie, so there should be shock value. Watch the scene after the credits because there will be a Fast Six.

- Rio Police cars are not Mustangs, Camaros or anything closer...these cars are way, way, way too much expensive in Brazil than they are in US, therefore you need to have some good cash to afford having one of those.

- Yes, there is a lot of corruption in Rio Police, and the idea of a safe like the one depicted by the movie would only be feasible if it was sponsored by that guy...no, I'm not going to tell it...see the movie ^^. But anyway, it was a nice catch: I would never think about it...

- If a ""gringo"" go to a favela and shows a handgun like that (well, first of all, he would never be able to get there the way he did...), no matter how big it is (the gringo and the gun)...he will LOSE it there...and get killed, of course (not necessarily in this sequence). So kids, don't try it there, OK?!

Well, I've got a lot of fun watching the movie for the action, and laughed a lot remembering the scenes and writing down this review. It it great fun for everybody though.",1321142400,2,1228,4.168776371308017
4363419,4,B004EPYZQC,"Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film.  Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.

Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.  Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.

Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of ""Desperado"" fame.  The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.

What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film.  Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts.  Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow.  Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.

Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise.  The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil.  International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious ""Danza Kuduro"" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico.  Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.

There are two elements of the film that stand out.  The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs.  The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.

The other element is the final car chase of the film.  Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving.  The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.

That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course.  To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption.  While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up averageacting at best.  I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much.  While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them.  Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene.  But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.

Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours.  While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.

Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general.  If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series.  Definitely give this one a rent, or get the Blu-Ray/DVD combo to own one of the better movies in the series.",1321142400,,4328,4.838315217391305
4363420,5,B004EPYZQC,"Ever wondered whether a meeting between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. The Rock would eclipse a meeting between Stallone / Schwarzenegger / Willis?

Wonder no more - Fast and Furious 5 conclusively ends that debate. This is an epic movie, original, creative action right from start of the movie to the end. Not only action is superb, the acting is good too. A movie with equal amount of action and heart. Paul Walker adds to the mix with his great acting as well.

The thing I like about his movie is there is virtually no gimmick. Just an excellent chemistry between a whole bunch of actors, mindblowing action and great storyline. I've never seen such action scenes before... epic!

4363515,4,B004EPYZQC,"Michael Bay could learn a few tricks from Justin Lin who directs his 3rd franchise hit.  Lin brings back Vin Diesel as Dom who is clearly in charge of the operation once set free from a prison transport bus in the dynamite opening sequence.  Most of the usual crew is back including Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster.  They and a few others end up in Rio.  Once there, needing money, they hook up with a local crime mob to heist a few high end cars.  This sets up another remarkable stunt sequence that is as exciting as those usually reserved for James Bond movies.  Before I get too gushy about the movie, let's get one thing clear.  It is implausible, improbable, and perhaps even impossible.  The acting isn't all that great, the plot is stupid and the science behind some of the stunt work ain't there.  Yet, after being drawn in during the first 20 minutes, you're hooked. You will also see some of the best stunt driving ever.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Park your brain and settle in for the ride.  This is the best of the ""Furious"" films...by a long shot.",1320192000,,1080,4.398989898989899
4363516,2,B004EPYZQC,"This film is a great example of why discriminating movie buffs could care less if hollywood fell off a cliff. There is absolutely NO TALENT in screen writing these days. These folks seem to think that all we need is a lot of BS stunts and CGI effects and we'll just drop to our knees in praise of them. As one other reviewer clearly observed, the stunts and some of the story line were SO ridiculus until it made the whole story unbelievable and utterly unrealistic. When I'm watching a supposedly non-fiction movie the one thing I absolutely can not stand is to have my intelligence insulted!  This movie does this hands down, so much so until it should receive an honor for its efforts.  In my opinion, Rock, Vin and Tyrese gave the best acting efforts...very matured and natural acting skills. I really like Paul Walker but he should take more acting classes because a lot of his lines sound too artificial...sounds like he forces his delivery too much.  Their ridiculus stunts were too much for me, they borrowed scenes from Clear and Present Danger (the ambush that killed all of Rock's men but curiously kept him alive eventhough he was in the middle of the street with NO protection against rapid gun fire), and, to me, borrowed too much from the Ocean's 11 & 12 themes (with the crew of 7 or 8 guys that all had different specialties, tired). The two Challengers that pulled a bank vault at high speed down the highway was just stupid...no snapped cabled, no rear ends being jerked out, not to mention the overwhelming effect the massive vault-weight would have had on the cars themselves.  It just got dumb at that point.

It was amazing to see that Brazil had Dodge police cars like America...I really didn't know that. I also thought it strange that a DEA task force of 4 or 5 men could come into another country and operate all willy-nilly without ANY cooperation with the hosting country other than one ""translator"" that ends up being Vin's love interest at the end credits. I'd like to see some other country come into America and try that!  Anyway, glad I didn't reward hollywood with a box office receipt for this (this is the main reason I don't spend money at the theatres today). There's worst entertainment for sure, but really disappointing for supposedly a solid franchise, and the fact that this movie took in over $640 million worldwide. What does that say about our moviegoers today?!?!  One last thing, fire the director from future projects for putting crap like this out!

What Danny Ocean did to Las Vegas, Dom Toretto does to Rio de Janeiro. He assembles a cool crew of specialists to take down a big-time crime boss. The action is (pardon the pun) fast and furious. When Special Agent Hobbs is added to the mix, you have a really volatile combination. It was fun watching Vin and Dwayne go at each other.

There is a teaser, hinting this 5th movie is not the final!  ""Do you believe in ghost?""

I'm reviewing just the blu-ray disc. The 1080p video quality is top notch. Detailed, sharp, but look real and natural.  The 5.1 audio is precisely decoded to play on designated speakers in such a way that I felt so involved: rockets whiz pass me, bullets riddled all through me in a cross fire, and car crashes / wrecks are just right level of sound force.

Also, falling into water from that height (jumping from the car makes zero difference - same velocity) into water is like falling on to concrete. They also forgot the air bubbles, debris and oil bubbling up from the car.
Also, the towing a massive several ton safe around at high speed was entertaining but about as believable as large headed green aliens.

So I hadn't seen a single Fast & Furious movie prior to this. But I was browsing through Best Buy for my copies of other titles that came out that day when I saw the BB exclusive SteelBook edition. So for the first time in a while, I made a blind-buy based solely on the aforementioned packaging and the fact that The Rock was in it. I expected the preconceived notion that the other films had established (fast cars and hot girls), but was very surprised at how great of an action-heist-thriller this turned out to be. The story starts with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) being sentenced to prison (I'm guessing from F4), and then breaking out. Meanwhile, former federal agent turned fugitive, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) are on the run in Rio de Janeiro. They agree to take a job to steal some federally-impounded cars belonging to Brazilian crime boss Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). During the robbery a couple of DEA agents are killed, in which the U.S. government then sends DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to apprehend Dom and O'Connor. Like I said, I've not seen a single film in the series, so whatever character-building there was I don't know about it. I just thought it would be interesting for once to take a movie this far into the lineup, watch it, and see if I'd like it (which I really did). Oddly enough, there wasn't as much street racing as I thought there'd be considering that's what I heard to be the draw. The action in this particular entry, however, is pretty exhilarating. I've been wanting to see The Rock in another action flick since The Rundown and Faster, and it's good to see him back doing what he does best (can't wait to see him in G.I. Joe either). And from what little I'd seen of Vin Diesel, I thought he was a pretty good action guy himself. But to see both he and The Rock duking it out (quite viciously, too) was very cool to watch. On top of that, the last half hour with the vault heist and all the stunt work they had to coordinate is among the best I've seen from a production standpoint. If you haven't seen any of the Fast & Furious yet, I can wholeheartedly recommend you at least start here.

Fast Five is another one of those movies that was filmed on 35mm then digitally processed, and it looks perfect on this transfer. I was convinced after just the first few minutes when they were stealing the cars from the train that the image would be a stunner. Contrast displays itself best during this sequence showing a lot of fine detail throughout the interior shots of the train when O'Connor and Mia are walking through the passenger car, down to the car car (it sounds weird saying that), and to the point when they cut the walls out to take the cars. In particular, the details I'm talking about are the shadow delineation amongst the lighting, the fact that you can see many of the grains of sand blowing through the air, and even some of the hairs on O'Connor's arms when he jumps out and hangs on the escape truck. Furthermore, when things get darker (from a lighting perspective) the detail remains just as immaculate. For me, it was the articulation of Hobbs' sweat running down his head and all the way to his beard. You can see each individual bead even when its dark outside. Colors are also handled extremely well, most notably in the scene with the car congregation where all the flashy cars, lights, and colorfully scantily-clad women make for some great eye candy. There are no instances of any tinkering whatsoever and the picture is as clean as can be. From a cinematographic view, I was very impressed with a lot of the footage they were able to get or integrate using as little CG as possible. A lot of the overhead shots of Brazil and the favelas add a nice exoticism to the feel of the movie itself, and I hope DP Stephen F. Windon gets more work in the future. My favorite scenes for reference are the chase in the favelas for its overall balance in detail amongst all the chaos, the police Charger street race in the middle for some great black levels, the aforementioned car congregation for all the colorfulness it exudes, and of course the scene where Gisele is getting Reyes' hand print because it's detailed, colorful, and I'm a guy and thinks she looks really hot in a bikini.

The DTS-HD MA 5.1 track here is every bit as captivating as the video. Oddly enough, Jon Taylor, the re-recording mixer, has worked on mostly romantic comedies or dramas in his career. He has a few horror and action titles under his belt, but considering how aggressive the sound is for Fast Five, I'm surprised his talents have been so underused. With that being said, though, whether you're a fan of the series or a complete newbie like me, the audio alone makes up a good third of the enjoyment. As I've noticed with a lot of other car-involving sound designs (particularly The Transporter series), a really good car can make for some cool sound effects. The first one you really get to hear is Dom's 1970 Charger. And holy crap, is that thing loud. Its first appearance comes in from the rear left and not only packed a floor-shaking rumble, but even managed to rattle the driver in my dinky old Yamaha tower speaker. And then you have the revving of the engines of the cars they steal off the train, and even the train itself, making for lots of noise. Dynamic range is especially proficient with a lot of the vehicles because of the various engine types, car builds, and the way in which they're used (some for racing, some for ramming, and others for towing). In addition, there's also a lot more gunfire than I expected for the supposedly racing-oriented film I thought I was going to get. When the chasing and shooting ensue, directionality and separation are outstanding. Much like the various number of vehicles shown in the movie, there are also various weapons as well. Something like 150 different guns were made for the film, and while I couldn't keep track of all the calibers and makes, I'll take their word for it based on what I heard. LFEs are a given if you haven't associated everything else about the sound design with bass already, which should also be apparent if you're familiar with the work of composer Brian Tyler (who puts a lot of bass into his music). My favorite scenes are the favela chase, the shootout with Hobbs' team, and that crazy vault heist sequence at the end that destroys and damages things all over the place.

Extras - 4.5

- Audio Commentary (Director Justin Lin)
With this being both the first F&F and Justin Lin-directed film I've seen, I was very surprised at how informational it was. Lin has a very candid tone and talks about a lot of the filming, the production, the themes he wanted to portray with the characters, the evolution of the franchise from the first to the fifth, and what it was like working with everyone involved. And for a director I'd never heard of prior to this, I have to say he sounds like he has a pretty good grip on things.

- Deleted Scenes (HD; 1:40)

- Gag Reel (HD; 4:17)

- The Big Train Heist (HD; 7:37)
Deconstructing the production and stunt work of said heist. Particularly how they wanted to use as little CG and visual effects as possible and to outdo action sequences from the previous films. I think they succeeded.

- Reuniting the Team (HD; 4:59)
The casting of the characters and actors from previous F&F films. Again, not having seen any of the previous incarnations I have no idea who's supposed to be who and what kind of emotional baggage they're carrying. But I'm glad they got Gal Gadot!

- A New Set of Wheels (HD; 10:09)
Talking about all the cars they used here in F5 and how they sort of represent some of the characters. It's a pretty interesting take on car-to-character symbolism, especially in the case of the main characters.

- Dom's Journey (HD; 4:55)
A look at the motivations and evolution of Vin Diesel's character. I never took Diesel seriously as anything more than just another action body playing the tough guy, but this feature actually sheds a good deal of light on the character of Dom Toretto.

- Brian O'Connor From Fed to Con (HD; 5:55)
A look at Paul Walker's character across the series. Weird to see how much of a West Coast, middle class ricer he seemed to be in F2 with the blond hair and super Caucasian attire. Hard to think he progressed so much up to this point.

- Enter Federal Agent Hobbs (HD; 5:50)
A look at The Rock's character. I love the fact that they even have him in this film. The guy is charismatic and brings a lot to the table with his natural ability to look, act, and be tough in any kind of action role he gets, yet appears so humble off screen.

- Dom vs. Hobbs (HD; 7:31)
A breakdown of the big fight and the challenges faced in filming it. Both Diesel and Johnson talk about how they really respect each other and have wanted to work together for a while. Well, they got their chance, and boy did they give a good show.

- On Set with Director Justin Lin (HD; 8:36)
A look at filming the Porsche test-drive scene. He seemed a little annoyed at the fact that the stunt coordinators and driver weren't giving him what he wanted. They did quite a few takes and had a lot of talk in-between. Thankfully, they got what they needed to.

- Inside the Vault Chase (HD; 9:20)
A great look at how they put the logistics and production together for this thrilling sequence. This is one of the coolest action/heist sequences I've seen in a while. Some of it is visual effects, but a lot of it actually isn't. If you're interested in film-making in general, definitely check this one out.

- Tyrese TV (HD; 6:35)
The actor goofing around on set. He talks to the camera, goes around and talks to Justin Lin and Ludacris, and then hypes himself up like only he can. If you like his personality and sense of humor, this is worth a look.

- U-Control
A P-i-P commentary featuring 17 segments of behind-the-scenes footage NOT seen in the other features averaging about 3 minutes per segment totaling to another 50-ish minutes of total bonus features. There's also an option to turn on Scene Explorer during U-Control to show 3 versions of the train heist in PreVis, Dailies, and B-t-S all at the same time or just one a time (in which the single view will take up the entire screen). The U-Control feature is a little more cumbersome to sit through and navigate than Warners' Maximum Movie Mode or Lionsgate's Bonus View, but is still pretty informational.

Overall - 5.0

I've heard the F&F franchise is something of a mixed bag. Some people say it's good entertainment and others say it's a waste of time. Not having seen any of the previous films, I can't tell you what I think yet. But based solely on F5 alone, I have to say I'm pretty damn interested in seeing them now. F5, in particular, is a great heist flick with lots of action and style that ironically and apparently also has some of the long-rumored elements of The Brazilian Job (as in, the sequel to The Italian Job) in it. For whatever reason The Brazilian Job never made it out of production hell, nobody knows. But if the F5 crew did manage to sneak it in here, all the better. The video and audio are easily reference quality and the extras amount to well over 2 hours plus a great commentary. So if you're a fan of the franchise (I guess) or at least a fan of this installment, don't hesitate to pick it up and enjoy the ride.",1318464000,21,11706,4.492242595204513

This movie is fantastic from start to finish, and seems to rise above its subject matter and origins.

The cast are great, and they all look like they are having tremendous fun. Plus, not one of the parts has been underwritten - all of them have something good to say or something fun to do.

My favourite was the Rock. He was wonderfully over the top in this movie, and he looks like he eats and drinks testosterone at every meal.

4363628,5,B004EPYZQC,"Remember back in the day when you were all wistful for Stallone and Schwarzenegger to be in the same movie or, on a subservient level, for Seagal and Van Damme to do something together? FAST FIVE is the best - and biggest - in the Fast & the Furious franchise for any number of reasons, but a big chunk of the hells yeah! stems from the Rock stepping into the series. You knew, you just knew, he and Vin Diesel would be champing at the bit to claim head chair in the pecking order. Adrenalin junkies are accordingly put on alert.

FAST FIVE opens by replaying the closing sequence of the previous (and fourth) installment, with Dom Toretto's (Vin Diesel) being sprung during his transit to penitentiary. This prison - or, more accurately, prison bus - break is masterminded by former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who has now irrevocably crossed that line. This marks the first time that Walker and Diesel's characters are working on the same side for the entire length of the film. And yet that streak of competitiveness is still there. O'Conner is still earnestly obsessed with proving that he's the superior wheel man. Dom continues to humor him, probably trying not to smirk.

Awesomely, FAST FIVE reunites the core cast of the previous four flicks, and I soaked in the cool factor of seeing Tyrese Gibson, Luda, Sung Kang, Don Omar, and Tego Calderon rub elbows with Diesel and Walker. Now fugitives from justice and finding stateside too hot for comfort, Dom, O'Conner, and Mia (Jordana Brewster) have fled to parts unknown. But when a daring Brazilian train caper goes south and ends up with Dom and O'Conner accused of murdering three DEA agents, in comes a relentless U.S. strike force ramrodded by the determined and growly Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). And right away you can feel the ferocity the Rock brings to his role. Oooh, I was anticipating the inevitable butting of heads.

But that's just one of the story threads. The central one concerns our likable rogues' planning and orchestrating of one final huge score. Dom and O'Conner have aimed with ambition and with brazenness, targeting the primo drug kingpin in Rio de Janeiro. Except that this Big Bad is one careful, meticulous sumbitch, his stash of $100 million cached in ten holdings spread throughout the city and guarded by an army of corrupt cops on his payroll. The trick is how do you get to all ten stashes without ruining that element of surprise? It's pretty clever how Dom gets around this complication.

FAST FIVE does present several good character moments which ground our cast, sort of. I say ""sort of"" because, honestly, this franchise's enduring global popularity is built around high-octane, wildly improbable, tremendously entertaining  action sequences (oh, and hot cars and hot chicks in skimpy clothing). But the franchise's stabs at a richer emotional tonality allow the viewer to accept the film's more absurd stunts or at least view them with a more expansive eye. We're treated to three audacious action set pieces (the epic train heist, the chase across the rooftops of a Brazilian slum, the runaway bank vault). We see the brutal, no-holds-barred Rock vs. Diesel fighty fight. We note the film's scorn of the laws of physics. It pays never mind to the logistics involving our heroes surviving a two-hundred-feet plunge into the drink or two cars hauling a bank vault while engaged in a car chase with a troop of police cars. It scoffs at the impossibility of fingerprints being lifted from a bikini. Except that these flaws don't bug me. I only point them out to demonstrate that I'm no wide-eyed daisy. I'm aware of the implausibilities, the ridiculousness of the stuff that goes down, as is director Justin Lin, if you listen to his audio commmentary. This film ain't for nitpickers; it'll be like target practice for them. For my money, FAST FIVE delivers enough solid character interactions, but, no, this isn't a Merchant Ivory production. Instead, it's all about the larger-than-life characters and their dangerous attitudes and it's about the stupendous wall-to-wall action. It's sheer escapism. And, also, maybe you should stick around for the closing credits.

The DVD's bonus stuff: Director' Justin Lin's Audio Commentary; 2 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:01:39 minutes); Gag Reel (00:04:17 minutes) and three featurettes focusing, respectively, on Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Dwayne Johnson and their character arcs: ""Dom's Journey"" (00:04:53 minutes long); ""Brian O'Conner: From Fed to Con"" (00:05:53); and ""Enter Federal Agent Hobbs"" (00:05:47).",1318291200,4,4560,5.009234828496043
4363629,4,B004EPYZQC,"It may be the best in the series...so far. This really is an ultra macho action movie. Good chases, fights, shootouts, and of course extremely expensive ultra fast cars doing all sorts of crazy things (amazingly w/ very few pedestrians or traffic). They blended a lot of the actors from the previous movies into this one. I enjoyed the Rock's character (Luke Hobbs), he played a real bad ass here and Vin as always plays the group's leader, the deep voiced, muscled up tough guy Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto. This film really makes the police in Rio de Janeiro look foolish and corrupt. Do they really drive those suped-up dodge charger police interceptor cars there? Somehow I doubt it. Apparently every city has an underground race club behind fences w/ hot girls that race thru the streets for ""pinks"" (a car's title). I don't know, I never see them. It's interesting they named the movie fast five rather than the fast and the furious 5. Anyways, it was a good action ""guy movie"". The downtown streets & bridge scene w/ Dom & O'Conner is killer. The guy who played the bad guy, Joaquim de Almeida, was also very good in his role. Very cool ending as well, although I wish they showed the final race instead of cgi everything. If you watch past the first few seconds of the credits they show a teaser for the next movie (scheduled may 2013) where apparently Michelle Rodriguez's character ""Letty"" is alive, Eva Mendes' character returns as well.",1318291200,4,1441,4.677165354330708
4363630,5,B004EPYZQC,"First of all, I love this series of movies, ever since the first one, but this one, oh wow! It is soooo awesome! I'm now rating this one as one of my top five favorite movies of all time. This movie is freaking awesome and it makes me drool. For one the cars, my dream car is a Nissan GTR, but one that is a little more affordable is the 2011 Dodge Charger and seeing them as police cars and also the 2012 Dodge Charger SRT-8's. I could believe it, they were awesome!
Now I haven't gone through all the blu-ray, but the extended edition I saw no extras scenes or notice any new parts, that I hadn't seen at the theater. If you wanted an extended edition, go get the Lord of the Rings extended editions, those were awesome, to me the longer the movie the better.
I am still definitely happy with the blu-ray, the movie looks great plus my fiancee can have the dvd, and with all my digital copies, I though about just putting them on my laptop and if I want to watch them on there some time I could.

All in all the movie is great, the blu-ray is great, can't be happier!",1318291200,,1069,4.114832535885167

4363694,3,B004EPYZQC,"This one was different from the rest. There was a lot more drama, and talking, mixed with some action. I guess I had high hopes for even A LITTLE more racing scenes is this whole movie.  It was more of an action movie with guns and muscles than what the original The Fast and The Furious started with.  Even though the director said they're trying to ""evolve"", get away from the racing stuff. It was a little disappointing to only see one real race, which wasn't exciting at all.  Then when you think there's going to be a race, they edit it out completely.  Probably because we know whose going to win in the end, sure, but it's still fun to watch.  ""The Rock"" (Dwayne Johnson) was a great addition to the movie. His character in this playing ""Hobbs"" was hunting down Dom, Brian and the team.  Also bringing back some of the other characters from the four movies before his one was a great addition.

I don't know, you be the judge.  If you like action movies with guns blazing mixed with some standard cars and destruction. Then you may like this movie.  If you only liked the other other fast and furious movies before this because of the street racing, cars, or feel of it.  You may or may not be disappointed.",1318118400,10,1214,4.379464285714286
4363695,4,B004EPYZQC,"I really liked this sequel even more than the original and the other sequels so far because the scenery in Brazil and the music were so amazing. Also, I loved to see The Rock and Vin Diesel doing the action scenes together, BUT I felt they got a little too carried away with breaking walls in the fight scene.
The cars and the driving were great, of course; and then the little teaser at the end was a welcomed surprise. Looking forward to the next sequel. :)

This movie in my opinion must have had a really good screen writer. because there were a lot of parts where the movie could have fallen off the grid to ruin this action packed blockbuster but it always took a turn into making ""fast five an instant hit to a fast five star rating!"" All the actors and actresses worked well together in a plot that made sense and flowed nicely into action scene after action scene!

4363747,4,B004EPYZQC,"The title for this ongoing sequel to Fast and Furious is, it seems, related to the number of films based on this fast driving bunch of car fanatics than to the number of people in the tribe. What makes this series of Pow and Wow action flicks stand above many of its competitors is the tremendous sense of fun the cast seems to be having - leaping over rooftops, driving fast cars, pulling off impossible heists. It all ends in a sense of fun and introduces the teaser for the next in the series (a bit with Eva Mendes and Jason Mignot in a brief talk after the credits run pretty much guarantees the next installment).

This time the guys and girls - Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), her boyfriend ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Vince (Matt Schulze), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), Han Lue (Sung Kang), Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot) Tego Leo (Tego Calderon), and Rico Santos (Don Omar) - gather in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - each in various stages of running from the past - hunted by FBI Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and in desperate need for money to escape Rio to countries where they cannot be extradited. They discover the one last job opportunity - taking away the money that billionaire Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) takes from the money houses in the infamous Rio favelas district.  It takes the talent of the entire crew to make the heist of heists as the safe where the illegal money is kept is in the police station in a huge vault that is impenetrable - until our gang takes over in likely the most interesting and entertaining chase scene on film.  The rest of the story is fluff but nice - with a little love interest thrown in for good measure.  This cast is strong and they pull of the fine line between comedy and drama very well.  In the end this is a fast and entertaining escape film. And #6  will probably come soon!  Grady Harp, October 11",1317859200,,1929,4.510028653295129

4363749,3,B004EPYZQC,A great set-piece and stunt near the beginning of the movie and a marvelously destructive chase scene at the end but nothing much between the two events.  Fans of the franchise will no doubt be well pleased.  Fans of knuckle-headed action movie can probably find better stuff to waste their time on.  'A-Team' for example was a much better knuckle-headed waste of time.,1317772800,,369,4.825396825396825
4363750,5,B004EPYZQC,"I am a big Fast and Furious fan as well as a fan of Dwayne Johnson. I put that out there first so as to make you aware of my bias. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I did not get to see it in the theatre so watching it on Blu-Ray was my first viewing of this. Parts that stand out and it is noted in one of the Extras, they try and succeed in establishing a deeper family aspect with the crew. That and fantastic action scenes does not leave the watcher of this bored at all.

BLU-RAY QUALITY: 4.5 STARS - Seen better but it was on par with the other movies and a good viewing.

STORY: 4.5 STARS - I like how they brought everyone back together and the story was alright. It definitely followed the franchise.

SPECIAL EFFECTS AND ORIGINAL ACTION: 5 STARS - The opening train heist scene was fantastic and the end Vault chase was amazing.

BLU-RAY EXTRAS: 4 STARS - I enjoyed the extras. Little insights to different parts of the movie. Good actor interviews. Good interactions with the director and extra behind the scenes cast. I have not watched the Director Commentary or the Theatrical Version. The Extended Version was good but no idea how much ""extra"" was included.

THE ROCK: 4.5 STARS - I have to rate the Rock individually because I am a fan. This character was a bit out of place and The Rock's performance adds to that. I did like his portrayal of his character.

OVERALL FEELING: I rate this 5 stars because as I stated, I like the Fast and Furious franchise and this was my favorite so far. Really I rate this 4.5 stars but with no .5 in Amazon I push to 5 stars as I will watch this again and likely watch the director commentary.",1317772800,,1644,4.270096463022508
4363751,5,B004EPYZQC,"They did it again with this one. The movie was great, just what you would expect from the series. They go a little more over the top with some of the things the cars can do in this film, but who cares. If you wanted to see a realistic movie about driving cars or grand theft auto then you knew before you saw this film that it wasn't for you. I highly recommend this film and can honeslty say that if you truely enjoyed any of the others you will enjoy this one too. The Blu Ray picture is amazing and well worth the extra money.",1317772800,,529,4.0

After breaking Dominic (Diesel) out of the jail bus Brian and him move to Rio to start a new life of robbing and stealing.  After Brian gets news that makes him want to stop running the team decides to pull off one last heist.  I have never been a real big fan of the series.  They are good but have mostly been ""I have car...I go fast.""  The fourth one was the best because it actually had a story to it.  Then I saw this one.  Far and away the best of the series so far.  For those that watched them for the racing I should warn you, there is only one scene in this one.  This one was more in the style of ""Oceans 11"" then a ""Fast & Furious"" movie.  I'm not sure if the sixth one they are making is needed, but like all movies lately they will make them until they make one too many...then the remakes start.  That reason aside this is a very fun and exciting heist movie very much worth watching.  Overall, I surprisingly liked it a lot and highly recommend this.  I give this a B+.

Would I watch it again? - I think I would, I can't say that about the other four.

4363787,3,B004EPYZQC,"Throughout the entire saga, it has always been about cars and the street racing scene... You had RX-7 (twice), Supra (twice), Skyline GTR 33, Skyline GTR 34 (twice), Evolution (twice), that super sexy Veilside RX-7 in Tokyo Drift, the monster Doge Challenger with the massive blower sticking out, S2000 (twice), Saleen Mustang, Corvette, Doge Viper, super trucks, NSX ,RX-8, Silvia, and 350Z just to name a few and most of these cars were in involved stunts that anyone who claims to be mildly interested in cars will find exciting.... Sadly, this movie does not have that aside from a short drifting sequence which was a bit played out since you had a whole movie dedicated to drifting, right!?

I had much higher expectations for this movie, I'm not saying that it wasn't tolerable, but it was more about the characters Dom and Brian than it was about the cars the street racing scene than the rest of the saga... you could have taken away the Fast & Furious name and it would have worked even better as a movie... because people didn't have those expectations associated with the name.

The movie  is exciting, at times predictable, and I think playing to the drum of Hollywood where everything is Brazil these days, but that's fine too. The addition of all those characters from the entire saga was cool to see but they added little value to resolving the plot... I mean adding so many super drivers didn't do something that say other drivers that Dom could have rustled up in Brazil could have done...

Now... my biggest tiff with this movie... The cars! Sure there were some really cool cars there, like the Classic Vette (a monster of a car!), Ford GT40, Dom's Doge, the Porsche, 350Z, and a few others... but the cars didn't really do much besides that short drift sequence!! Less than 5% of the movie! Really think about it... compare it to the other movies in the saga... there's not much there about the cars themselves... it was more about the characters and resolving a situation / plot!

I'm not going to even discuss the ending with safe stunt... I think others have torn the flesh off of that one enough! But the ending... oh man, how can you just end it with a shot of the GTR and the Doge like that... you had a brand new GTR and you never used it for the movie!!! RETARDS!!! Had they not done that at the end I would have been much happier with this movie!! It should have been more about the cars and the street racing scene!",1315699200,3,2445,4.535147392290249
4363788,5,B004EPYZQC,"Beware, the extended cut of the movie primarily adds minor content changes; there is one new scene, which is detailed below.

The Extended Cut is slightly over one minute longer than the theatrical cut, most new scenes add just CGI blood, most of the time the blood being barely noticeable.

1)  When Zizi's armed thugs attack Toretto's hideout, one of the thugs has his gun turned on himself by Toretto with CGI blood added in.

2)  When Hobbs attacks three of Zizi's thugs in the favela shootout, there is re-inserted CGI blood when Hobbs shoots one and knifes the other.  The neck breaking of the last thug seems a little more brutal.

3)  Hobbs' men fire on Zizi's thugs for a few seconds longer.

4)  Slightly extended scene where Tej asks for a duplicate safe.

5)  New scene: Discussion by Toretto's crew regarding breaking into the safe and transporting it.  They discuss the existence of the bathroom having a ventilation shaft which leads to the garage.  This scene then segues to Leo and Santos.

6)  Toretto/Hobbs fight scene slightly longer and more brutal.

There is nothing particularly new--the characters are still on the wrong side of the law, they still do things with cars most of us wouldn't dare to dream about and they look good while doing it.

The new wrinkle in this one is The Rock--excuse, Dawyne Johnson--as a super Fed hot on their tails after they get wrongly accused for the murders of some federal agents.  But rather than running, the crew decides to pull ""one last job so they can retire"".

So just like in any other fast and the furious movies they have stunts and what not that you know a car wouldn't hold up, and wouldn't be drivable after it happen. But the were on the border line believable which made it awesome. Just did some of that movie magic stuff just like in any other movie. In this furious movie it was different. it was good from the start wasn't great just good. Had the normal stunts type stuff cool story line, and seem to have a twist to it different from the other movies, but then there was the last seen. The last stunt. It just totally ruined the whole movie or me.

In the movie the say it's a 10 ton safe or some outrageous number. That's 20,000lbs. Also it's concreted into the wall of a building so it might as well be 100 tons. A peterbuilt semi might be able to get it to move, maybe just maybe, but 2 dodge chargers with hemis are not even going to budge it. I doubt the differential would even hold up, also you would need something a lot heavier then a 2 ton car, a couple of muscle cars doesn't even come close to having enough torque/horsepower/weight to move it. No matter what engine mods you did to it, even if they were four wheel drive it still wouldn't have enough grip, power, strength to move it. A dodge truck with the 5.9 cummins in it wouldn't even have enough, and that makes more torque then the chargers could ever even think about.

I understood it was a movie also the other movie had ""fake"" stuff in it just like any movie does, but they made it seem like it could possibly happen, but when they had those 10 ton safes were whipping around on the road like they were ten cans that was just stupid. Defies all laws of physics period. I probably won't even buy the movie even though I own all the other ones.

Now saying the stunt could happen. Say they did pull the safes out of the wall with a couple of dodge chargers.

For anyone who has towed anything that weighs more then what the vehicle towing it weighs. The trailer normally ends up controlling your car and you not controlling your vehicle. It'll pull you all over the road and everything else. Unless you just got like five miles an hour to your destination. Now these cars are just whipping these 20 ton safes around like they are tin cans, and it doesn't even come close to pulling their car in a direction they don't want it to.

The whole thing was just bogus and ruined the whole fast and the furious movie for me...

Now if you can get over the fact of simple physics, and don't look too much into that then you would probably like the movie.",1315180800,5,2581,4.244399185336049

When it came out I went to see it (several times) and I don't recommend seeing it on the Big Screen, it just got to close.  That being said this movie had action and lots of it.  I loved it!  With each movie in this series the only thing negative I can say about them is that it was a mistake to not have Vin in all of them.  Of course Vin rocks as an actor and he just keeps getting better and better.
A couple of the reviews talk about how it wasn't possible for the two cars to pull that safe through a wall.  Guys, it's the movies.  That's why it's the movies.  You know, to bring fantasy to the big screen.  Can't you just enjoy seeing something for the fun of seeing it done?  Who cares if it could happen in real life or not.  Heck, is it something you plan on doing?  Anyway, watching these muscle-bound guys in awesome muscle cars was great!  Justin Lin is an impressive director.  I'll have to watch more of his stuff.  Brian O'Conner, Tego Caldern and Don Omar are becoming fast favorites of mine.  You want to know the best part though?

4363824,5,B004EPYZQC,"Fast Five is a return to form of the franchise which began 10 years ago in 2011. After several attempts to recreate the original magic (including Fast And Furious from 2009 which featured both Paul Walker and Vin Diesel) which didn't quite satisfy, Fast Five not only brings back most key characters from all the previous films (thankfully sans Lucas Black from Tokyo Drift), but manages to become the most action-packed and fun film in the saga, and begins a new chapter in what hopefully will be more films to follow.

The characters have evolved so much since the original, and it is quite a bit of fun to see. Add to the mix Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as an DSS agent, and you get to see a brawl that action stars have been drooling over for years.

This is a no-brainer for your movie collection, if you have ever enjoyed the F & F films, or are an action-movie junkie. The best in the series, hands down.",1314576000,2,909,4.404761904761905

I am a huge fan of the series having bought the DVDs and the Blurays for all 4 (so far) so I Was really looking forward to this. Throughout the movie there were a lot of suspension of disbelief (as you should) in any movie. Mainly on what cars can and can't do but there are some things that go to far.

If it would have been in the context of fantasy (Harry potter casting a spell and a giant magical elephant pulls the safe out the window, or Yoda uses the force and pulls it out) Then YES by all means I can be like ""oh well it's a movie. The force is strong within him"".
However, when it's 2 real cars pulling a real safe out of a wall I just can't swallow it. I really ruined the movie for me and should for anyone that's ever watched Mythbusters.

I wanted to like this, but once again a stupid ending ruined an otherwise ok movie. I was even enjoying it a bit and began to think maybe this will be better than 2 through 4, but in the end when they completely defy the laws of physics and have to cars--that might weigh 3000lbs each--that have a combined HP of maybe 1000hp (if tuned) and have a two inch x ten inch tire patch (times four driving tires) pulling a safe that has to be half a million pounds that was built into a building. Not only do they pull it, somehow their mass is enough to whip it like a water skier behind them and smash it through buildings all while going maybe sixty or seventy mph though a city. There is zero chance any two cars in history could have moved that thing an inch...come on people. Really, I know it's just a movie but this is just stupid.

4363846,5,B004EPYZQC,"I rarely ever do a review on here of anything. Even though I have bought numourous things off of Amazon I rarely ever do a review. But after seeing Fast Five I feel like I need to tell the world how good it is. But if action movies aren't your thing and your more of a Black Swan or Benjamin Button type of person this ain't for you. But if you like good unbeliveable action movies that keep you on the edge of your seat than this is for you. Vin Diesel and crew really out did themselves with this one and one can only imagine what part 6 will be like. Yes the action is unrealistic and would never ever happen in real life without them dying but that's the fun of these movies. You see stuff you wouldn't normally see in real life like two guys driving a car off a cliff into the water. Or someone dragging a safe full of money down the freeway knocking over cars in the process. Or shootouts over roof tops in Rio. Besides the action in this movie I like the characters in this one or character, The Rock. They finally introduce someone how can take on Vin Diesel and make it believable. When Rock is off camara you want him back and when he's back he is on point. Rock should get his own spinoff or something after this and it's nice to see him back in a action movie. Rock and Vin Diesel go at it in their fight scene which I hope there is more of in part 6. The other characters are from the previous movies like Ludacris, Tyrese & others. They are brought back to help Paul Walker and Vin Diesel pull off a heist against a man who tried to have them killed in the beginning. It's nice to see the characters from 2 Fast reunited and even those from Tokyo Drift. There isn't much street racing and I think that was a good choice. I think that it was a good ideal for them to drop the whole street race angle because it was getting played out and refresh the franchise with the whole heist job thing. Although they should have started it with Fast and Furious because that was sort of a letdown. Speaking of Fast and Furious it's ashame they went and killed off Diesel's girl she would have been good in this. Oh yeah watch after the credits to see the set up for part 6 if someone hasn't already told you about it or you' ve already watched it on Youtube.",1309910400,2,2260,4.126984126984127

4363848,5,B004EPYZQC,"The first Fast movie I saw was #4 and only because my son begged me to go.  The movie grabbed me from the opening shot, and didn't let go until the close.  I literally found myself trying to catch a breath at times.  Of course, I immediately had to go out and buy the first three.  #1 was so good I couldn't believe I'd missed it for all these years.  #2 was very good with at least one of the original cast and the addition of a couple of other good actors.  #3 was nothing like the others, but was, for what it was, watchable.

I couldn't wait for Fast Five to open and was not disappointed at all.  We are huge Vin Diesel fans and love the Rock, so this was a real treat for us.  We've actually seen it twice at the theaters and will probably go at least one more time.  And I just preordered the DVD.

No matter how you see it, though, sit through the credits for a real surprise!

4363851,4,B004EPYZQC,"The Fast and the Furious franchise seems to be getting better with age. The first on was a good movie. Then the second one came out which was average at best than Toyko Drift came out and that was just plan terrible. I considered the franchise dead after that but then I saw Fast and the Furious and it gave life to the franchise. It's rare to see a franchise getting better with age. Usually Things start to go down hill after the second movie of a franchise. From the Lethal Weapon movies, to the Terminator movies and of course all of the horror genre. So it's surprisingly rare for a franchise to survive the test of time and you wouldn't expect this franchise to be one of them and Fast Five might be the best movie of them all.

Fast Five has a above average story. Starting almost directly after the first one. The overall story is about the core group trying to find a way out of the endless running from the law and family. There's another plot about a drug lord and a missing computer chip but it isn't very good. That shouldn't matter to most simply because you don't go to see this type of movie for a amazing story and great acting. You coming to see the great action, cool cars, and hot women. You get plenty of all three in this. Still I'd say this is the best story of all the movies since the first one.

The acting ok but look at the actors none of the are great actors and none of them are going to win Oscars in their acting career. Still all the actors from Paul Walker to Tyrese Gibson to Sung Kang to Dwayne Johnson aka THE ROCK are having a good time and have great chemistry which makes up for the acting.

Now for what everyone goes to these movies for the action. Which is mind blowing. From a scene where a group steal cars from a moving train. Another was a on foot chase in slums of Brazil(Which the movie was filmed and is beautiful.) where Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel go one on one in one of the one one action scenes you'll see with out CGI. Finally there's the climax which I won't say anything about but will blow you away.

Also there is a scene after the main credits that will imply what the inevitable next movie will be about.

Overall this is the best of the franchise with great visuals and action and a above average story and decent acting.",1307145600,,2286,4.221967963386728

4363877,3,B004EPYZQC,"You can't give this movie 5 stars...you just can't. It is far from perfect, also it is cliche'.  Oiled up muscle bound guys looking straight out of the gym, hot ladies in slim bikini's, racial jokes, stereotypes, people walking in slow motion while explosions disperse behind them and they are unaffected in their motivational attitude, impossible survival scenes that would kill you 100% of the time, etc.  BUT...if that stuff is what you are looking for or doesn't bother you, this movie is very enjoyable.  There were parts of this movie as a cynic I was like ""hey wait a minute"".  But after my girlfriend was like ""It's just a movie""..""just watch it""  I sat back in the theater and thought well then to heck with it and it was very enjoyable.  Like an adult cartoon.  Sure characters:  how they got this and that, where they came from, how they knew this or that and how two cars can drag a few ton safe down the road at speeds other than 3 miles an hour suspend you belief a little too much, its still fun to watch.  Lin is a fantastic director.  Not cookie cuttering a movie together that gives you a headache with repetitive violence and zero interesting story (see he horrid Transformers movie).  He splices the scenes together without using the same rehashed pans and cliche shots and sounds that everyone else uses.  Vin Diesel who honestly is a horrible actor...seriously he is just plan awful has about as much personality and as a stapler and his acting consists of looking like he has to go to the bathroom and flexing in a tank top.  But for this movie that is all that is required.  He is as usual the bad boy with a heart of gold that never loses or gets frustrated when things go wrong and people die.  He shows about as much depth as possible when he sinks his head and in one scene seems to be looking at his biceps while he tries to pass gas.  Such vulnerability, its a wonder he never got past these movies.  The Rock Johnson, is the new addition and does the usual dual bad boy generating a hint of humor with a stone face that has made him likable in any scenario of action or anger.  The Rock has the biggest arms on screen of any of the muscle men in the movie...of course they are oiled up in every shot but its The Rock, who cares.  He also is always sweating, who would have thought a Samoan couldn't take Rio heat.  His character however suffered because he was the more interesting of the angles in the movie but wasn't explored in a manner that would have made this movie a little better.  There is one gap that he is missing from frame for almost 30 something minutes to where you almost forget he is in movie.  Like I said the chicks are hot, the Asian guy eats some kind of bagged item, Luda and Ty make black jokes and impossible things happen which is per order of the movie.  My favorite being how they infiltrated the police station.  After causing a septic problem in the bathroom two good goons pretend to be plumbers and carve a huge part of the cement wall so they can cut into the security mainframe...how did they patch this hole to where it would be undetectable is unknown.  It wasn't even close to the toilets.  Another is the fight between Rock and Vin, busted up faces and bruises vanish as soon as the scene changes to 5 minutes later going down the road in the squad car.  REGENERATION POKEMON!!!  Still I found this movie filmed well and very enjoyable.  It never stalls or drags and never has overkill.  I recommend you get this.",1304812800,3,3483,4.388455538221529
4363878,5,B004EPYZQC,"** PLOT SYNOPSIS (MINUS ENDING)**

Vin Diesel is busted out of prison and is reunited with his sister Jordana Brewster (who I fell in love with in D.E.B.S.) and her bf Paul Walker in Rio, the most recognized skyline in the world. They are bad guys stealing cars off a train. As things turned out, these were cars seized by the Brazilian DEA, who for some reason unlike their American counterparts don't disable the vehicles. Due to infighting, the effort is partially botched and Vin Diesel and Walker end up as captives of a Rio mobster. They discover he wants one of the cars back real bad. After they escape they dismantle the car to find out way.

Meanwhile Dwayne Johnson comes down from the US to take back Vin Diesel. It seems the US has jurisdiction in Brazil, but hey its a movie. From a chip in the vehicle, Vin Diesel discovers that the crime boss has money stored in various cash houses throughout the city. Walker and Vin Diesel assemble a Mission Impossible team to go after the cash. They attack the first cash house and burn the money which forces the mobster to relocate all his eggs into one basket. As it turns out, that basket is inside the evidence safe at the police station, making the task of that one last hit a bit more difficult. At this point the movie takes a few interesting twists and turns.

The plot contains numerous implausibilities as does most Mission Impossible action movies, vehicles that can bust through concrete walls (that never use rebar), and don't even scratch the head lights. The ending will keep Myth Busters busy for a season.",1304812800,,1577,4.585106382978723
4363879,4,B004EPYZQC,"The Fast and the Fiveous is a high octane thrill ride that speeds along at a frantic pace, leaving plot and character in the dust. But that's ok, because all we care about is who wins the race. The movie gets into gear with the opening scene and never lets up. Sure, it's low quality. I know, the writing is bad and the characters' choices make no sense. And yes, watching Vin Diesel try to smile is a painful experience. But in the end, you'll find the whole thing stupidly entertaining.

In fact, it was so stupid that my brain sort of shut off while I was watching and I'm having serious trouble coming up with anything useful to say. Did I already mention that Vin Diesel fights The Rock? Basically, if that sounds good to you, you're gonna love this movie. Otherwise, steer clear. But if you feel like reading on, be warned that my mind is not firing on all six cylinders. Five Fast Five Furious picks up where the last one left off (as if anyone's keeping track), with Dom (Vin Diesel) in jail. It takes all of 30 seconds for some stunt driving to flip the prison transport bus he's on, sending Dom twirling towards freedom--and man does it flip, over and over and over and over, until it comes to its final resting place. Boom: title screen. What an opening. Though there were only 6 people in the theater, it immediately filled with cheers. The movie must have anticipated my fear for all those poor prisoners' lives, for shortly after the title, we get a news report assuring us that no one was harmed. Dom and co. would never hurt an innocent prisoner.

From there, we launch into a kickass train sequence with all sorts of fighting and stunts that would leave the main characters dead a dozen times over (I'm looking at you, 500 foot fall off a cliff). But who cares? It's awesome! That's sort of the theme of Fiveous in case you hadn't noticed. Unlike Source Code, which fails because it tries to be smart but is instead riddled with errors, this movie succeeds with flying colors. It tries to be dumb, so we watch it on its own terms, accepting everything that doesn't make sense.

For example, the characters are totally weak and one-note. Doesn't matter how many cops Vin Diesel kills. He's not a bad guy. He just loves his sister and gets put in tough situations. We feel so much empathy for that dude. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) isn't just a cop who turned against the force and became a car-stealing criminal. No, he's a guy with a wife. How can you not feel for him? Especially when his wife is extra hot. She is, after all, the lovely Jordana Brewster. She doesn't do a whole lot, but not only does she have an amazing body, but also she's pregnant. Gotta care about her if she's got a baby in her belly. The characters make all sorts of irrational decisions and have no depth, but they're exactly good enough.

The cops are even worse though. Dwayne Johnson's motivations are all over the place, and his sexy partner lets her lust for Vin Diesel's muscles get in the way of her job time and again. In another film, these might be problems, but in Five Furious, everything's already so ridiculous we just don't mind. Like I said, we get to see Vin Diesel fight The Rock. That's all I need, and it's probably the highlight of the movie. My friends and I kept shouting ""Ohhhh"" when someone would land a particularly devastating blow (which happened like every other punch). I'm pretty sure the other 3 members of the audience were as into it as we were.

When people weren't fighting or smashing things, the movie did start drag, however, and not the race sort of drag. Every once in a while I'd catch myself actually listening to the dialogue, which was a big mistake, because I'd overhear things like this: There's a basically uncharacterized Hot Girl repairing part of a car or something. The also uncharacterized Asian Guy walks up and says: ""You really like doing that stuff, huh?"" Hot Girl thinks a normal response to that question might be something along the lines of: ""When your life is on the line--that's when you learn about yourself."" Then Asian Guy says: ""That's a fair deal."" Deal? What deal? Are these people even talking to each other? The exchange makes absolutely no sense, which apparently gets Hot Girl off, cause next she flashes this overly flirtatious look, followed by a cut away. What a beautiful scene. But heck, when the two of them hook up while driving at the end of the film (very dangerous. do not recommend), I was happy for them. Why not?

Why not? I'm pretty sure that's what the screenwriter must've said whenever someone questioned one of his scenes. But it works! I mean, this is an action movie first and foremost. Whether or not it's a good film boils down to one thing: how much did it kick ass? The answer to that question, my friends, is A Lot. I mean, Dom literally rips a 20 ton bank vault out of a wall. Before this movie, if you'd ask me how many times I could be entertained by seeing a giant bank vault smash a cop car while being dragged along the street chained to two sleek racing vehicles, I'd probably have said four or five times. But now I  know the truth. It's dozens and dozens of times. Scores of times! Vault smash this car. Vault smash that car. Vault smash one car. Vault smash two cars. I think the movie actually states that the vault smashes every single cop car in all of Rio. A very impressive feat by anyone's standards, to be sure.

There ya go. Fast Five is pretty awesome. Shut off your brain and turn on your, I dunno, eyes? If you go to this expecting B-grade entertainment, you'll have a great time. Fast Five does a surprisingly good job of keeping up the excitement at all times, and as long as you don't listen to the dialogue, there won't be a single dull moment.

The family is back, and this time, they are re-recruiting many of the actors from the other four F & F's. As an added bonus, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and the 5'3"" extreme hottie, Elsa Pataky, are on board as well. ALL of the F & F flicks are a bit short on storyline, but who needs a lot of pondering, yawn-inducing love stories, and brain-damaging twists to make the best picture of the spring? Not Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, or Paul Walker, that's for sure.

After Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) break Mia's brother, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), out of a bus transporting prisoners to their final destination, prison, we soon find them all shacking up in South America. Although the entire train scene was edge-of-your-seat, the real white-knuckled fun starts in Brazil, and there ain't too much ""shacking up"" going on here either. The story is a bit thin, so for me to elaborate on it would give it away in totality, however, I can tell you that the story is exactly what it's supposed to be...perfect and not too over-the-top for what the movie is trying to do, which is bringing on the action, relieving the tension with occasional humor (VERY funny stuff, by the way), the rooting for the good guys (who are essentially bad to a degree), the serious love between the Toretto's (Dom, Mia, and their brother, Vince), and their love for O'Conner. It's a tight-clique buddy-flick, like ""The Losers"" and ""The Expendables,"" but MUCH better than the former and even a bit better than the latter.

All of the five-star reviews you're seeing on Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes, and Blu-Ray.com are the real deal. You honestly feel for these people, and you care what happens to them. The action sequences are top-notch, well-filmed, and superior to anything I have seen recently, or ever, for that matter. There is some truly incredible stuff going on here...especially the whole vault scene, which was absolutely awesome, to say the least.

If you like action flicks, PLEASE don't miss this one. It has everything you're looking for and more. Also, make sure you stick around for a final scene after the credits roll. This scene tells us that there is NO QUESTION about a F & F Part Six coming up in the near future.

One more note: If you haven't seen any of the first four movies, at the very least, watch the first one, ""The Fast And The Furious,"" before checking out ""Fast Five."" It will get you in tune with the main characters. I believe it would be hard to pick up on the depth of these people without knowing some of their back-stories first.

Fast Five is the best movie of the spring so far and one of the best action movies ever made. FIVE STARS HARD! *****",1304467200,,2788,4.599597585513078
4363881,4,B004EPYZQC,"I remember seeing the first one and being wowed by it. I was just a kid, so of course it was something for me. I was 10 and saw it with a few friends and loved it. However I can't recall being impressed with a single sequel since then. Especially the puke fest that was ""Tokyo Drift"". 2 Fast was boring as hell and FAF seemed very slow and unfocused.

So I didn't expect much from this movie... and all I can say is WOW.

This movie was actually not bad for once. I can't believe for the first time I am able to say I enjoyed a TFATF sequel.

The plot isn't anything original or groundbreaking- but the movie is well aware of it, and just piled on the action. That said, even the unoriginality was entertaining- the setting of Rio, a mob boss' money, the robbery of the money, etc.

The action is intense and involving- I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in movies 2-4, so this was much needed. Furthermore, the finale, where two cars transport a bank vault (not ridiculous enough for you?) was incredibly fun, as was the shootout and roof-jumping scene.

The humour was evident- the script was like Aaron Sorkin wrote an action movie. I loved the scene where the bomb goes off in the toilet pipes, causing a rain of poop in all the stalls, as was the police car racing scene, etc. Great balance of humour and action.

The cast was great too- Vin was his usual cool self, but gotta say, Tyrese Gibson stole the show!!! I loved how he said ""Say What?"" at every impossible situation. The Rock was fantastic as well- I was looking forward to seeing him in it, and he did a fantastic job.

My one complaint was that the movie was a smidge too long- maybe 10 minutes should have been trimmed, but ah, what the hell I had fun.

You know what... give the crew a cookie, they did a good job with this movie, they made it fun and entertaining, and therefore even if you hate the franchise, the movie stands out on its own well.",1304294400,,1926,4.257534246575342

8427533,5,B004EPYZQC,"Probably the best of the series (even including 8).  The cars play still play an important role.  Plus, watching Diesel and The Rock fight is awesome.  Now back to the cars, yes, they aren't into tuning cars as they were early on, but the cars are an actual character, if it fails, then the mission fails.  Ok I know it's like if my car doesn't start I can't get to work, but I can still take my wife's car to work.  Here the cars they choose must serve their purpose.  For instance in the very new ones, you can replace one car with another to get the job done, here the cars they use are specific for their cause.",1524009600,,615,4.126050420168068
