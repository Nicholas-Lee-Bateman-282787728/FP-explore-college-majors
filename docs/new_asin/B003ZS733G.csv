8410759,4,B003ZS733G,"For years I have been hoping for some of these B thrillers to be released on DVD. This film can be bought on its own or as part of a 5 discs set exclusive to Universal with limited distribution. While some younger viewers may not really get excited over such films, old Universal Horror fans will certainly remember Lionel Atwill starring in a string of these atmospheric thrillers.

'The Strange case of Doctor RX' is one that I wasn't familiar with and only knew of the name, not the actually movie. It features Lionel Atwill in a small role and is more of a comedy ""who dun it"" than a horror movie. Of course there is murder, mayhem and a gorilla! This film runs just over an hour and is a fun thriller for those who enjoy the good old horror days.

The print here looks very good and Universal has included some extras including lots of stills, lobby cards, posters and some on screen trivia about the film. I doubt this film and the four others included on the box set Universal Cult Horror collection will see a general release.",1399420800,,1034,4.408376963350785
