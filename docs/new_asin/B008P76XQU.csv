so I rolled the dice. There was always the remote possibility that there could be a sliver of merit in this
performance. There isnt. Unmitigated trash. Watched a grand total of 5 minutes and threw the disk into
the trash. Always go straight for The Bacchanal with S et D. The Bacchanal is one of the most fabulous,
elaborate, sensuous, and gorgeous ballets in opera. So if its not up to snuff the entire performance is
snail snot. There was no ballet. No dancing philistines. Just oil derricks, a woman shoving her privates
into the face of someone chained, and someone being flogged. It was enough to gag a maggot. I was
robbed, bamboozled, hornswoggled, flimflammed, insulted and nauseated. One of the high lights of most
French operas is one or more ballets. And S et D has the very best. A French opera without a ballet is like
a camel without a hump. Take my ballet away and you have one unhappy camper.

According to the blurb that came with the disc the tenor who sang S, Jose Cura, was the vandal
responsible for this hideous abomination. Something about enlightening us about human suffering or
some half-baked pretentious codswallop. During the 5 minutes I watched this I experienced insufferable,
onerous, massive human suffering. If an artist wishes to lecture us with his views on politics, please get a
soap box, go to a public square, palaver to your hearts content, and let the pigeons provide you with the
accolades you deserve. Do not desecrate a work of art to bore us with your moronic politics. This turkey
doesnt deserve any stars. It deserves a black hole. But one star is as low as we can go. Mr. Cura has
gotten his last cent from me and I hope he develops a malady that makes his voice sound like Porky Pig
on helium.",1409443200,3,1843,4.56797583081571
8529456,3,B008P76XQU,"The video pictured at the top of this page features Jose Cura as Samson. Most (but not all) of these reviews, however, discuss a different performance which features Domingo as Samson.  There have been similar confusions at Amazon in the past: when Giergev's recent Die Walkure cd set was listed for pre-order but had not yet been released, many reviews were listed for a 30 year old version conducted by Boulez.",1363737600,2,412,4.802816901408451
8529457,1,B008P76XQU,"The music on this DVD is absolutely beautiful.  Every singer is excellent, the orchestra and chorus are wonderful, as is the conducting.  If I had a CD of the performance I would be in bliss.  Unfortunately, the director made some choices that for me at least erased all meaning for the drama.  The sets are dark, ugly and awkward.  It's hard to know how the acting was because the action itself was unclear.  Who is Samson, other than the tenor?  If this is to make any sense, he is a hero.  But that is unclear.  He doesn't even seem like a leader.  And what is this unspecified adolescent guy doing wandering around the set?  What are these oil derricks doing and why are they being used by these guys in military uniforms to shine spotlights on these people, who I gather are the Hebrews.  And what is this scuffle, and why did that old guy die and in general what is going on here?  The less said about the invasion of the quasi-lesbian women in white robes, who spent as much time pawing each other as supposedly seducing the ""Hebrews"", the better.  Ditto all the women crawling all over each other in Dalila's boudoir.  (And what is that giant shape behind her, for goodness sake?  Is that Samson the giant or is it her god or what on earth?)  And that's just the beginning.  Absolutely glorious music!  Some of the chorus pieces sound like an oratorio.  If I can find a DVD of a production that treats the story and the characters with more respect, I'll go for it.  But having been burned here with this one, I may just stick to CDs.  Look at the cover.  Says it all.",1350950400,8,1576,4.358620689655172
8529458,4,B008P76XQU,"Keris Nine review, is altogether a very positive one that I share, even considering irrelevant comments such us Dalila's anachronistic dressing. Dalila is a priestess and as such she dresses (within the limits of the designer's fantasy, of course). No point has to be made on this as a ""mistake"". Just see how priests of almost all religions dress even today, in the XXI century.

One thing however cannot be accepted in Keris Nine review, and it should be immediately removed from the text with an ERRATA CORRIGE NOTE of apology, and is the accusation of this DVD being a NON LIVE recording. I quote Keris Nine: ""... it's clearly filmed without an audience present... "" The film was done during an ordinary performance (dates are mentioned in the DVD, by the way), with the cameras placed among the audience, as every other LIVE opera recording. The only difference is that the audience or the theatre's building can't be seen (neither the wings nor the pit). This simple but new approach in operatic live filming, resulted in the more cinematographic look that has mislead Keris Nine. Altogether, this mistaken comment can be considered a positive thing for the viewer: the fact that, even watching an opera, you will be carried away from the ""theatre's building restriction"" and taken to an almost movie-like experience.

A great production, properly filmed and superbly sang. A must have, considering the poor number of existing versions of this epic opera.",1348617600,3,1461,4.959183673469388
8529459,4,B008P76XQU,"The question of whether Samson et Dalila might not be better suited to the setting of an oratorio than an opera has been a problematic issue ever since Saint-Sans started work on it back in 1867, ten years before its first performance.  With its biblical subject and choral emphasis, the original intention of the composer himself was that it should be an oratorio, but he was persuaded by the librettist Ferdinand Lemaire to turn it into an opera.  The reality is that the completed work lies somewhere between opera and oratorio, omitting a great deal of the dramatic episodes that occur in the story of Samson and Delilah, while even some of the most famous and well-known scenes occur off-stage.  In an attempt to make the function better as a drama, Argentinean tenor and stage director Jos Cura injects some contemporary references into his 2010 production of the work for Badisches Staatsoper, but while the quality of the work and its performance here are pretty much beyond reproach, the question of the work's nature and its suitability for the stage remains unresolved as far as this production is concerned.

Designed and directed by Cura himself, it's not a terribly imaginative production.  The concessions towards modern relevance and contemporary allusion are half-hearted and heavy-handed, not really going much further than relating the enslavement of the Hebrew people and conflict in the Middle East to the corporate ambitions of oil companies in the region by setting a few oil-rigs on the stage.  It's a static set design that remains unchanged throughout Act I and Act III, the lighting permanently dark chiaroscuro, the only variation being the rather clichd imagery of silhouetting the rigs against a burning red sunset in the first act and against the midnight blue of night in the third.  It's also uncommitted with regard to the contemporary setting, since although Samson and the Hebrews and even the soldiers wear modern and casual clothes, Delilah and her priestesses wear traditional white tunics, and Act II goes to some length, despite the sparseness of the decoration, to wrap Samson in the curtain backdrop in order to ensure that it retains the look and feel of traditional biblical imagery.

There's little consistency to the concept and it's so lacking any insightful observations about contemporary issues in the region that you wonder what the purpose is in (half-)updating it at all.  If it's an attempt to create a workable dramatic context for the work, it doesn't really succeed, since the actual stage direction within these limiting sets remains fairly static, and even the 'Danse des prtresses de Dagon' consists of nothing more than a traditional processional march (although the beautiful young women seem fond of kissing and fondling each other elsewhere).  Musically however, and in terms of the singing - with Jos Cura reprising a signature role and Julia Gertseva providing the necessary persuasive glamour as Delilah - there's more than enough dramatic expression to make up for the lack of stagecraft and it's here that the true qualities of the work, regardless of the uncertainties in its categorisation, are revealed.  Cura, I find is a little too stentorian, sacrificing clarity of French diction for sonority in an old-fashioned way, but it's a committed performance that, certainly in the third act, draws out and enhances the deepening sense of the visceral brutality of the drama and dark betrayal that it there to some extent in the score.  The fine performance of Gertseva however, particularly in her duet with Cura, singing a powerful 'Mon coeur s'ouvre a sa voix', ensures that there are no weaknesses in the other vital aspects of this magnificent work.

The actual filming of the production itself however also raises some questions.  The sleeve and booklet notes on the DVD (Cura even writing the liner notes) go to pains to convince us that this performance was recorded LIVE, but it's clearly filmed without an audience present and, since some of the lip-syncing doesn't match, it's possibly edited together from a couple of different performances or has even been overdubbed.  Certainly in the case of Jos Cura, his lip-movements and performance don't reflect the delivery at the start of the first act, and he sings most of the third act from beneath a hood, so the full dramatic performance isn't always there in the way that it might be before a live audience.  Also, curiously, some of the other singing is done off-stage to the extent that you aren't always sure whose voice you are hearing.  In the case of the old Hebrew, for example, an actor (Walter Schreyeck) plays the role but the actual singing of the role is performed off-stage by another person (Ulrich Schneider).  Again however, although there are close-ups and some different angles used, there doesn't seem to be any actual trade-off in making this filmed performance any more visually interesting.  Other than a brief flashback montage at the start of Act III though, there's nothing too clever or distracting attempted either.

These curiosities in the staging and filming are however minor considerations and don't take away from the fact that overall this is a terrific performance of Saint-Sans' Samson et Dalila.  The orchestra of the Badisches Staatstheater, conducted by Jochem Hochstenbach, give a strong account of the lyricism and the dark power of the work and they are assisted considerably in achieving the necessary impact by principals and by the outstanding work of the chorus.  On the DVD release, there is a certain amount of reverb on the singing that takes away from the clarity a little, but the recording of the chorus and orchestration is fine, exhibiting lovely detail and tone.  There's good presence in the 5.1 surround mix, and the PCM stereo option is also excellent.  The widescreen image quality is reasonably clear, considering the sharp contrasts on the darkened stage.  The DVD is region-free, NTSC, dual-layer.  Subtitles are English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Korean.  There are no extra features, but the booklet contains notes by Cura and a full synopsis.",1348012800,6,6149,5.074404761904762
