8072641,5,B000A2VK48,"SUPERB STUDIO VIDEO OF LOVE IS BLINDNESS. IT IS NOT A LIVE VIDEO,TAKEN FROM THE TOUR ,GREAT IMAGERY ,SPECIAL EFFECTS AND APPEARANCES OF THE BAND IN FULL ZOO GARB FROM THEIR 2ND STELLAR PERIOD! THIS ALONE IS WORTH THE PRICE. THE NUMB VIDEO FEATURING THE BAND IS VERY GOOD ,WITH SOME FUNNY MOMENTS ,THE NUMB VIDEO OF THE INDUSTRIAL VERSION IS OKAY ,IT WAS USED WHILE THE EDGE SANG ON THE ZOO TOUR - JUST NOT AS GOOD SINCE THE BAND IS NEVER SHOWN IN THIS RELEASE! OVERALL WORTH IT ,GREAT SOUND QUALITY",1172188800,,498,4.365591397849462
