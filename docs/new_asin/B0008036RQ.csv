8406790,5,B0008036RQ,"This is a poorly written film about a dog who wants to make it big in Hollywood.  It is hysterically bad.  So why the five stars?  Because it was enjoyable to watch a bunch of big stars of the past drive the dog around LA. Because the fashions represent the eclectic styles that made up the 70s.  Because Jim Backus and Vincent Price are running slow-MO down the beach. Because ZsaZsa Gabor convinces the puppy to not be a stripper.  Honestly, watch this with low expectations and just enjoy the ride.",1508716800,,501,4.461538461538462
8406791,3,B0008036RQ,Very odd dog story from Jim 'Mr McGoo' Backus. I've never heard or read about this TV show. I didn't like seeing the dog tossed several times.,1500163200,,142,4.296296296296297

8406794,4,B0008036RQ,"This 1971 Jim Backus-produced one-hour TV show was originally entitled MOOCH. The lead is a long-haired mongrel whose real name was Higgins. If you think that Mooch looks like movie bowser Benji, you're right! Higgins portrayed both animals.

This seems to be an opportunity for Backus's Hollywood buddies to make a few quick pesos. Of especial interest is seeing these celebrities in their everyday clothes, which in some cases are quite hideous. Vincent Price wears a powder blue leisure suit and mutton chop sideburns that descend to his chin. Backus appears in an eye-burning red sport coat but worst of all is Eddie Robinson. His ""every color of the rainbow"" sport jacket and unmatching garish trousers scream: ""burn me please!""

The story:
Mooch arrives in Tinseltown via an open boxcar. Narrator Zsa Zsa (dahling!) gives the aspiring canine pointers on how to succeed in Hollywood. Mooch really tries, but the best she can do is endear herself to Vinny Price, Jimmy Darren, Jill St. John and Jim Backus (who in a dream sequence appears as a putty-nosed Mr. Magoo!). A failure in the movies, Mooch goes home for good with a Bel-Air veterinarian.

Actor cameos include: Mickey Rooney, Marty (""Hello dere!"") Allen, Phyllis Diller (looking positively freaky!), Jay C. Flippen, Darren McGavin, David Wayne, Cesar Romero, Rose Marie, Dick Martin and Sam Jaffe. All but Rooney appear at a poolside party at Backus's home.",1394236800,,1421,5.064102564102564
8406795,4,B0008036RQ,"DIGIVIEW's slimline cased DVDs feature unrestored public domain films that have no subtitles or extras beyond plot synopses on their back covers. As with all such bargain brands, dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair. Audio levels are however some of the highest you'll find, which makes these ideal for laptop PC or portable disc player watching.
