3119839,5,B0013XS87K,"I just finished season 3 and I feel that it tried to break the mold set by seasons 1 & 2. (Both seasons 1 & 2 were bookended by two-part serial killer episodes.) I detected a hint of an attempt to make the show more ""hip"" by some producers by sexing up the transitions between plotlines and between commercial breaks.  Thankfully that bit of stylized goofiness was tamped down by episode 4.  Personal lives get more attention. Most of the mysteries aren't solved or solved ambigously.  There are two great episodes that center on traffic fatalities. Another outstanding one happens in ""real time"" as Da Vinci tries to score dope for an addict/suspect.  Can't wait for all seasons to be available.  I find it also entertaining to catch Battlestar Galactica cast members guesting.  This is the show that was doing it better and more ""real"" 10 years before the CSI's, the SVU's, and (good lord) the Dexter's.
  P.S. to Acorn or Haddock or whoever is deciding the release dates of this thing... Do I really have to wait another 5 years to get to ""City Hall"" and ""Quality of Life?"" C'mon people... Up it to two-a-year at least.",1226448000,10,1122,4.6313131313131315

If the Canadians can do it so well why can't we?  Nicholas Campbell does a wonderful job in the title role.

3119842,5,B0013XS87K,"13 great stories, most with no clear cut ending, that stimulate the imagination and leave one thinking about, ""what happens now?""  What happened to the greiving father who still does not believe that his daughter died accidentally or what happened to that two year old boy once he reached five did his mother kill him too in some ""accident"" or was she the wretched victim of bad luck that she claims?

In any case the writing is excellent and the acting, particularly from those actors playing the survivors of their loved one's accidental or intentional death is both breath taking and painful to witness.

Season three introduces the wonderful Kim Hawthorne as detective Rose Williams, who joins the investigative team (not without some tension), and amps up Irish actor Gerard Plunkett's role as Da Vinci's sometime ally/sometime obstacle chief coroner Bob Kelley.

3119905,5,B0013XS87K,"Addendum to original review:  1/2/10 - KONG is running DaVinci's Inquest on Saturday nights in Washington State.
----------------
ACORN HAS BROUGHT ""INTELLIGENCE"" OUT ON DVD - BOTH SEASONS.  SO WHY NOT DAVINCI'S INQUEST AND DAVINCI THE MAYOR?
CBC is rebroadcasting both series and the audience is still there.  Chris Haddock has a following and ACORN continues to fail to respond to that.
You've read all the rave reviews about this series.  And they're right - it does get better and better.
CBC should bring back anything produced by Chris Haddock - and why not bring DaVinci back?
And furthermore - why not put ""The Quality of Life"" on DVD as a movie?
It was a great show, ran one night, and those who love DaVinci will love ""Quality...."", if they missed that one opportunity to view it.  Are you listening, ACORN?  Chris Haddock's shows have a following and you wouldn't be putting the 2nd part of ""Intelligence"" out on DVD right now if you didn't realize that.  I find it ridiculous that you don't just put out a pack of all the DaVinci's Inquest shows and another of DaVinci the Mayor.  Putting one season out every year is balmy!",1236729600,12,1136,4.673366834170854

3354401,4,B0013XS87K,"I love this series and hope the rest of the seasons of it come out soon. If you like forensics and cop shows this is one of the best without the too fast pace, slickness and pseudo-intellectualism of some of the newer shows. These are ""real"" characters. Chick is one of my favorite characters and I feel that Da Vinci's ex-wife gives off a bad aura right from the first season. I was disappointed that there was no closed captioning on this dvd set despite the description. The first 2 seasons had it but the third did not even though they were all from Acorn.",1248912000,,560,4.3428571428571425
3354402,5,B0013XS87K,"Addendum to original review:  1/2/10 - KONG is running DaVinci's Inquest on Saturday nights in Washington State.
----------------
ACORN HAS BROUGHT ""INTELLIGENCE"" OUT ON DVD - BOTH SEASONS.  SO WHY NOT DAVINCI'S INQUEST AND DAVINCI THE MAYOR?
CBC is rebroadcasting both series and the audience is still there.  Chris Haddock has a following and ACORN continues to fail to respond to that.
You've read all the rave reviews about this series.  And they're right - it does get better and better.
CBC should bring back anything produced by Chris Haddock - and why not bring DaVinci back?
And furthermore - why not put ""The Quality of Life"" on DVD as a movie?
It was a great show, ran one night, and those who love DaVinci will love ""Quality...."", if they missed that one opportunity to view it.  Are you listening, ACORN?  Chris Haddock's shows have a following and you wouldn't be putting the 2nd part of ""Intelligence"" out on DVD right now if you didn't realize that.  I find it ridiculous that you don't just put out a pack of all the DaVinci's Inquest shows and another of DaVinci the Mayor.  Putting one season out every year is balmy!",1236729600,12,1136,4.673366834170854

IT's bad enough the series has been long cancelled but those in the US who never got to see it all desperately need the rest of the seasons.

8253175,5,B0013XS87K,"This is, by far and hands-down, the best police procedural show EVER. The realities of scene protection, proper forensic technique, evidence gathering, chain of evidence, coroner's autopsy -- even if it is Canada, this is how it's done in the real world (or as close as you will ever get on a TV show). The internal political jockeying, cover-ups, corruption, ass-covering, the conflicts of police vs fire and IA vs rank and file -- it's all on this show, which also manages to deal with social and criminal realities of drug use/abuse, sex workers, grow houses, etc. as well as the grief and anger of those who mourn the victims of criminals. Da Vinci's own struggles with alcohol are dramatized, and despite a ""night time telly"" sort of feel, it is really the best police procedural ever (better than L&O, imho, although the various L&Os are more prime time legal melodramas than they are police procedurals).

Man I wish the rest of the seasons were available on DVD, because I would buy them ALL. Unfortunately there are only DVDs for Seasons 1 through 3.",1493683200,,1059,4.755434782608695

8253182,5,B0013XS87K,"Vancouver has more Chinese than any North American city so why aren't any of the major characters Chinese...or black?

Unlike ""intelligence"" (which is headed up by a fierce black woman' ) Haddock tells us little or nothing about the private lives of the major roles...which makes them appear pretty one dimensional and boring.

I would love to see a respectable openly gay character on this show instead of coy innuendos and sleazy gay stereotypes that pop up to titillate. Canada was the first to recognize gay marriage years ago.",1435622400,,531,4.955056179775281
