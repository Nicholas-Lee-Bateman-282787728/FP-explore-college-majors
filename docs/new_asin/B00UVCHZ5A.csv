Plot

Demon Baby aka Wandering Rose

Rose and her husband Theo are traveling around in a camper, While they are driving down the road Rose sees an apparition that looks like a woman and swerves to avoid hitting her. As this tripe fest continues we see every time Theo wants to make love she seems about as interested in it as a water hating cat wants a bath, they make out it gets steamy ready for the fun she has one of her pain in the ??? flashbacks accompanied by the sound of a crying baby every time bang bullet in the head she kills it by rejecting him through the whole movie. There is no demon baby occult or demonic things in this movie, it should not be marked as a horror movie it is more of a psychological drama

Her flash back is

She's laying on a table with her feet up in stirrups in a room with a doctor about to do a procedure he's telling her to relax, there's the sound of a crying baby after a zillion times of this crap, finally the big reveal flashback she's with Theo telling him she doesn't want to have the baby yata, yata. Then on the table for the abortion I can't do this she says. Theo puts his ear to her belly he hears something the baby they argue when she denies she's pregnant then tells him she aborted it, Later on in the shower they begin to make love as usual she stops him Mad Theo stomps out, outside he hears a scream runs back in she sliced her wrist with a razor

8708501,5,B00UVCHZ5A,"I still can't believe how great this movie ended up being. Demon Baby exceeded my expectations by far! I love a good horror movie and I'm pretty sure I found my new favorite movie! When the movie first started, I thought oh it probably won't be scary, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The movie had me scared and on edge the whole time. I give props to whoever did the special effects as they were so realistic. I honesty felt like I was in the movie. After watching  this I couldn't sleep...I was scared that a demon might try to get me in the dark. I really hope they make a sequel and that it will be just as creepy as this one. Good horror movies are hard to come by nowadays so I'm really glad I found this gem. I HIGHLY recommend you to buy this movie (once you watch it, you'll see how much of a steal 10 bucks was for a movie this good.)",1444348800,3,849,4.023668639053255

8708505,3,B00UVCHZ5A,"I love Rosemary's Baby subgenre movies, but this one was a disappointment. It's starts out promising, but just goes downhill and gets chaotic and lame in the last 30 minutes. Wait for it on Netflix or Amazon Prime.",1439510400,4,214,4.657894736842105
8708506,2,B00UVCHZ5A,"This movie lacks,direction, acting skills and a decent plot.  These demon baby movies are almost becoming cliche.
The best "":demon baby movie"" of all time is the original.,""Rosemary's Baby."" It is still great 50 some years later. You want a decent demon baby movie , go for the original. You will not be disappointed.",1435536000,7,317,4.87037037037037
