  Having made three films on the subject of train travel, I can see the difficulty in making an interesting film about something about which passengers are largely complaining. There was, I think, too much stasis and not enough scenes of the train in motion. Maybe it could have been better if passengers would address themselves more to what they think the train should be. The golden age of American railroading was between 1947 and 1957, before Southern Pacific threw in the towel. I concede the problems, but think the film could have been more interesting.",1238803200,,578,4.86734693877551
