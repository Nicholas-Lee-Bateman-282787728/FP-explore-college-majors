""Don't Give Me The Finger"" - better than any of them...only story you didn't already know the ending.  The rest you've seen before (many times over).  Who put this pathetic film together & who gave them $ to do it?  You may want to skip the 1st one all together unless you're a little kid who laughs at stupid situations.  Most stories are good enough for elementry school students to have done them.  Not college kids, not even high school kids.

My favorite mix of short stories?  ""Short Cuts"" by Altman...",1412121600,,663,4.45
8298732,4,B001ELLC92,"I initially decided to buy this dvd because of the horror short CUT, which premiered on a Sci-Fi Channel special hosted by Wes Craven where the film was picked as ""one of the most shocking, short horror films ever.""  It rocks.  Bloody, gory, scary, funny, a good story and very suspenseful.  Way to go Wes!

Then when I'd heard it was on this anthology with other shorts starring some awesome actors like Gary Oldman, Jason Alexander and Rob Schneider, I was hooked.  And let me tell ya, this puts some studio flicks to shame.  Totally something for everyone if you're up for comedy, drama or horror or mob caper.  And it's great to see these big names in alternative roles other than the buckaroo bonzai studio melarchy. Kudas for them in helping out their fellow filmmakers.",1114992000,,776,4.661764705882353
8298733,4,B001ELLC92,"This DVD has 5 short stories. We enjoyed every one of them, espsecailly the one called ""Cut"".",1114905600,,93,4.529411764705882
