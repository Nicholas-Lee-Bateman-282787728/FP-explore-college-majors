8269827,5,B0018JKLTM,A fun movie.,1508803200,,12,3.3333333333333335
8269828,3,B0018JKLTM,"This is an oddity.  I got it because I was curious about Jeff East, who plays younger Clark Kent in SUPERMAN THE MOVIE.  He's a tad younger in this, blonde with curly hair (you wonder how they ever saw him as Christopher Reeve's younger self).  This is a horror story about a college hazing gone really wrong.  There's some eye candy of Jeff East running about in a jock strap for a big chunk of the movie and the story has an intriguing premise, but it's cheaply made and lacks some plausibility.  Still, it's not a bad movie, but perhaps worse--a bland movie.",1496102400,,561,4.407766990291262
8269829,4,B0018JKLTM,Don't let the crappy new dvd cover fool you this is a good 70's comedy/thriller. Worth a watch and the extra's are great.,1495497600,,121,4.304347826086956
8269830,5,B0018JKLTM,"It's a DVD, and the DVD i received contained the movie I hoped it would.  It was in fact the movie my brother-in-law was looking for, so kudos all around.

I reserver judgement on the movie itself.",1447200000,,197,4.297297297297297
8269831,5,B0018JKLTM,"This movie was released in the USA under the title THE HAZING. It really freaked me out since I saw it in theaters at about age 10. I enjoyed re-watching it, although I don't know if I would have if it had not been memorable from childhood.",1439942400,,240,4.127659574468085

8269833,1,B0018JKLTM,"During a hazing, Barney (Charles Martin Smith) one of the pledges dies. Pledge Craig Lewis (Jeff East) is asked not only to keep quiet about the issue, but fill in for Barney in his classes.

I am not sure how funny this film was in 1977, it sure is boring now. The only decent character in the movie is killed off thirty minutes into the film. The rest of the characters were dry and dull with terrible dialogue. Rated PG but feels like it was made for TV.",1398038400,,457,4.193181818181818
8269834,3,B0018JKLTM,"This isn't a top notch 70's horror flick, really, it's more a mystery than anything.  During a hazing incident one young man (Charlie Martin Smith) appears to have died.  What takes place then is an elaborate cover-up to protect the guy that was supposedly responsible for the death, which becomes more and more complicated as time goes by, until the guy can no longer deal with this ruse.

This is a rather talky movie, and it takes a very long time to get to the payoff, which is a rather strange twist ending which I didn't see coming.  It's entertaining enough, I guess, in a time-wasting kind of way, but I wouldn't run out and recommend it to everyone I know.  As always, some may like it more than others.  3 out of 5 stars.",1220745600,3,731,4.377777777777778
8269835,1,B0018JKLTM,"What a poor transfer. It's like watching a beat up VHS tape. I usually like everything from Code Red/Shriek Show/Anchor Bay DVD's but god this movie was badly made. This movie was made in 1977 but the transfer and cinematography looked like an underground adult movie from the early 1970's. Everything was all blurry and grainy. Even before the film started the DVD titles stated that ""Some film have been lost and some picture quality isn' perfect"". Boy, that's an understatement.",1218758400,2,481,4.950617283950617
