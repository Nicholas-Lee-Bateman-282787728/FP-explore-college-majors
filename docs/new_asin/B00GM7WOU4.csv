8624533,5,B00GM7WOU4,"At Last!  A body-friendly exercise program!  For those who hate gyms, this program is all the more unique for those who are turned off by that environment. Yoga practitioners will find it offers more in strength training, as well as flexibility training. It helps to develop discipline and is beneficial as a well-structured weight loss and fat burning routine. The instructor guides you through step-by-step, so you don't have to be an exercise expert with knowledge as to how the body works. Incorporating Eastern discipline with Western training into a fitness program is the way to go in developing healthy muscles and stamina, increasing flexibility, and fat burning/weight loss.  And, the instructor has a light-hearted and engaging demeanor; the exercises are demonstrated methodically and with the patience of a good teacher.  Great stuff!",1386547200,,847,5.345864661654136
8624534,5,B00GM7WOU4,"These exercises have been a part of my life nearly 15 years. I can't imagine my life now without these exercises and I am forever grateful to Mfundishi Bakari for his guidance and expertise. Power Chi Energetics were particularly helpful to me during my last pregnancy with my daughter. I was able to maintain my strength and energy up until the day I gave birth. Afterwards, my body also snapped back into my original shape and condition within 1-2 weeks - amazing to me and quite a different experience from my first child  years earlier. I recommend Power Chi Energetics unreservedly and this DVD in particular (although I would also recommend his earlier ones too).",1385769600,,669,4.817391304347826
8624535,5,B00GM7WOU4,"I LOVE THESE!!! I am an amateur figure competitor and I didn't think this type of routine would help me the way it truly has. The DVDs have been very helpful and informative, and have complimented my bodybuilding rather well: I am more flexible, I have less stress, and I feel more in tune with my body. I highly recommend Master Bakari's DVDs to anyone who feels like they could benefit from a little more strength, flexibility, and a little LESS STRESS! :-)",1385510400,,459,4.542168674698795
8624536,5,B00GM7WOU4,"I recently purchased both the Learn and Burn DVDs. This is truly an amazing system which works with all ages and skill levels. The movements are each explained and performed making it easy for anyone to follow. At first the movements seem somewhat counterintuitive but as you start to learn and do them, you quickly gain an appreciation for the system's ingenious simplicity. I was out of shape and slightly overweight but honestly thanks to Power Chi Energetics I quickly got into the best shape that I have been in over 20 years!",1385424000,,531,4.720430107526882
