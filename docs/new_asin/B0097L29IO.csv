reason these are currently ""in"" is because of Tarentino and DJANGO UNCHAINED. Believe me, in a few weeks they will be back on the shelf.",1361318400,,256,4.818181818181818

5276929,5,B0097L29IO,"After the success of Director Sergio Corbucci's classic 'DJANGO'- 1966 starring Franco Nero, many sequels in name only of the character sprouted like weeds on the public and only two had anything to do with the original character.  Here we have a perfect example of that in which the main actors in both films are just named Django without the machine gun in coffin.  The archivists at Timeless Media Group have released an incredible double feature for an unbelievable price that even people who hate westerns might want to purchase.  What is wonderful is that they are in their original aspect ratios and transferred from the original negatives so that you can really appreciate them on your high def monitors.  First up is Director Eduardo Mulargia's 'A MAN CALLED DJANGO' aka 'W DJANGO' aka 'VIVA DJANGO' aka 'LO CHIAMAVANO DJANGO'- 1971 and starring Anthony Steffen in one of his best roles .  This film was released a while back by a company called Dagored Films.  I have already scribed a review of that release so any one interested in the plot, please seek it out among my reviews.  I will, however, comment on the vast improvement of the transfer.  Dagored released it in a 1.85 ratio with faded color and annoying scratches and splices appearing in the negative.  This version is in its correct 2.35 ratio encompassing the full beauty of Cinematographer Marcello Masciocchi's images and compared to the other, it's a revelation and gives the film the honor it deserves.  Another success was Director Gianfranco Parolini's  'SARTANA'-1968 starring Gianni Garko which spawned sequels also and why not have both characters show up to the party in the same movie. Next up is one of them, a Western with many outrageous titles  to its credit 'DJANGO AND SARTANA'S SHOWDOWN IN THE WEST' aka DJANGO AND SARTANA ARE COMING...IT'S THE END' aka 'FINAL CONFLICT...DJANGO AGAINST SARTANA' aka 'SARTANA, IF YOUR LEFT ARM OFFENDS, CUT IT OFF' and finally 'ARRIVANO DJANGO E SARTANA...E LA FINE' -1970 directed by Mr. Eccentricity himself, Demofilo Fidani who is billed as Dick Spitfire for this release and is also known as Miles Deem to all Spaghetti Western fans.  The film has many incredible names linked to it: Hunt Powers in the Django role; Chet Davis as Sartana, the awesome Gordon Mitchell as Black Burt who kidnaps beautiful Simone Blondell for a ransom and cameos by Krista Nell and the great Ettore Manni.  The Photography is by future Director  Aristide Massaccesi aka Joe D'Amato who constantly throws incredible images at your eyes and a unique score by Coriolano Gori.  The film consists of the sparring dynamic duo teaming up to rescue the girl and eventually revealing why they both were interested in the affair.  The film is consistently entertaining and is presented in its original 1.85 ratio looking like it was made yesterday.  Both films have their original trailers and poster galleries as the only extras but who can quibble? I highly recommend that every Spaghetti fan scoff this and its companion volume up because Timeless Media Group was responsible for one of the best Spaghetti Western box sets called what else? 'THE BEST OF THE SPAGHETTI WESTERNS' released last year consisting of 20 films on 10 DVD's in their original aspect ratios and which is now out of print and commanding high prices ( I think you can purchase it from their website but don't quote me on that). These two volumes may go the same route and become limited editions.  It's obvious that these films were released on the DVD market because of Director Quentin Tarantino's new reboot of the genre 'DJANGO UNCHAINED' but who cares when you can get them in these pristine transfers.  Kudos to Timeless Media for these wonderful releases at such incredibly low prices.  May they continue releasing more of them in the future and now I am on to the next volume which probably will blow me away just like Django and Sartana's explosive gunplay.",1355788800,18,3939,4.893233082706767
8537472,5,B0097L29IO,"Sure, these aren't top of the line Spaghetti Westerns, but they are full-on entertaining to the maximum, and for the price are the equivalent of Klaus Kinski pillaging a stagecoach. The Timeless Group who assembled this package have been putting together some mighty fine presentations of these lower-end but fun-fun-fun dubbed-in wonders for some time now and hopefully can/will continue on into the next milky-age.

Keep in mind that these are GENRE movies; I have a friend who cannot understand the appeal of the Spaghetti Western and though I respect that about him he also gets my sympathy as there are times that NOTHING ELSE WILL DO when it comes to filling that void in what can make me smile like Rosalba Neri running game on a scallywag cowpoke.

In other words, once you get hooked on good-mediocre-bad dubbing, there's no turning back and you will not be satisfied until you quench your appetite to the fullest which may be never but you accept your fate nonetheless. However a certain segment of society will say ""look at that unsightly person over there, can't anything be done to eliminate them from our sight?"" (and rest assured someone somewhere near is working on programming a robot or a drone to do their dirty work for them to that end but don't get me started on management-cowards and their endless quest for the seamless employee in order to receive the next promotion/climb up the ladder of soulless anti-redemption).

""A Man Called Django"" (1971) is a non-stop revenge-fest that did the trick, but the 2nd feature here, ""Django and Sartana's Showdown In The West"" had me hugging my sides in disbelief at it's incredible style and script, not to mention acting prowess.

Eat canned ravioli's for a week if you have to, but by all means, if you love this genre, get this 2-on-1 DVD disc set!",1518912000,,1815,4.789137380191693

8537476,5,B0097L29IO,"I am giving this one 5 stars because of the picture quality and because it's the best copy of W! Django (here called A Man Called Django) I have ever seen. Having bought several version that were all poor VHS transfers, I was overjoyed when I started watching this one.

If you're into Spaghetti Westerns, this is a classic B Spaghetti with brilliant moments of filmmaking (esp. the end which is brilliant - it's a different twist on the end of Death Rides a Horse) and some really dark encounters.

For the collector, it's a MUST HAVE.

And, yes, the audio is screwy as all Spaghetti Westerns were shot silent and dubbed into multiple languages so you'll just have to get over that to enjoy this collection.",1433030400,2,708,4.559055118110236
8537477,3,B0097L29IO,"Overall, the pack includes ""A man called Django"", a mid quality Spaghetti western (3 stars), and ""Django  and Sartana's showdown in the west"", a bad to awful film (2 stars at the most). Given the low price of this DVD pack and the good quality of the transfers, I gave it 3 stars overall.

A man called Django
This film was directed in 1971 by Edoardo Mulargia, and originally entitled ""W Django!"". Here, Django (played descently by ) is on the trail of some renegade outlaws who raped and killed his wife. In his way, he rescues a horse thief from hanging and discovers the man knows who committed the murder. The men team up and head west for revenge, until a final surprise comes near the end. This movie is generally entertaining, with a good dose of shooting and body count. A good technical add to me is the use of the camera during some shots; it remained me the Italian Giallo style. This film runs for 90 minutes. Overall, this one is a medium, but good piece of film, by far, the best of the two.

Django  and Sartana's shodown in the west
The film was ran in 1970 by Italian director Demofilo Fidani (as Dick Spitfire) and originally entitled ""Arrivano Django e Sartana...  la fine"" (about: Django and Sartana arrived, that's the end).  The story goes like this: a gang of outlaws lead by the out of his mind Burt Keller kidnap Jessica Colby and decide to flee to Mexico (it is never clear why he needed this woman to cross the border to Mexico). Then, bounty hunters Django and Sartana join forces to rescue the poor girl and get some cash. That's it. To be up front, the story and details of the script look like a kid from prep's essay during a cinema workshop. The dialogs are crude and extremely basic; the acting goes from bad to awful. So, some buyers may still feel they are getting two movies for the price of one here. Instead, I feel I got one for a good price, still a bargain given the good transfers in this release. This film runs for 83 minutes.

Technically, the DVD transfer of both movies is very good. Both transfers come in nice widescreen format. The audio is in English with no subtitles. The DVD is NTSC, region 1. Extras include the trailers of both movies and some movie posters.",1425686400,,2216,4.416666666666667
