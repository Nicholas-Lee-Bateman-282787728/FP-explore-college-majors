7955290,1,B00005UQ9C,"Joe Esposito and Elvis's Girlfriend Shiela Ryan are in this DVD strictly for the money.  What they say may be true, but they  try to come off as the innocent bystanders.  Shiela has the nerve to talk about Elvis' addition to prescription drugs when during her interview she is obviously ""strung out on drugs"" herself and no one could believe her phony cry at the end of the DVD.  I have walked in Elvis' shoes in that I was addicted to the strongest diet pills available at that time,  sleeping pills, nerve  pills, etc.  Fortunately I have been ok for years.  Elvis would most likely be alive today if these two characters had really cared about Elvis and not just his money.  They were not his friends...they were his enablers and helped Elvis to his grave.  Please do not buy this DVD and let your money go to these two people who are taking advantage of what Elvis thought was friendship,  but instead were using him for their own greed.  If they couldn't help Elvis, they could just as easily walked out the door.  But no, they stayed and even now are cashing in on Elvis.  SHAME, SHAME, SHAME !!!",1246233600,2,1102,4.445
7955291,5,B00005UQ9C,"a long interview with sheila caan, if only she became sheila presley instead. just like june juanico his timing was a little too late. i can watch this one over/over. recommended.",1211587200,,179,4.806451612903226
7955292,1,B00005UQ9C,I thought this DVD was the biggest waste of my time. I am a huge Elvis fan and have seen many movies about him. This one by far is the worst ever. Don't waste your money. I threw it in the garbage after I watched it.,1207353600,,216,3.717391304347826
7955293,2,B00005UQ9C,I thought this dvd would be a good purchase but I was disappointed in the contents.  Many things were repeated throughout the dvd.  People kept saying the same things with maybe a few extra words during each of the sub topics.  Not one that I could highly recommend.,1196812800,2,266,4.5
7955294,5,B00005UQ9C,"This is an excellent DVD on the last days in Elvis' life, told with love and honesty from people who knew him.  Well worth the money.  A must for every true Elvis fan.",1179187200,8,167,4.03030303030303

7955296,5,B00005UQ9C,"Who wrote that stupid review who can't even spell?  How dare you say I had a thing for Elvis. He was my friend. I cared for him like a big brother. I certianly had no crushes on him. How can you make a statement like that when you were not even ""allowed"" to get close to the man yet alone anyone else around him.
By the way, I am still very very close to Joe Esposito as well as his wife Martha. You have no idea what you are talking about. Learn to spell if you plan on putting anything else in print weirdo.",1089244800,18,509,3.894230769230769
7955297,4,B00005UQ9C,"This was a good documentary about Elvis' last years. It covers topics you won't find in Joe Esposito's new DVD. Interestingly, in this DVD, Esposito does offer his insights into the more painful topics about Elvis, such as Elvis' mood swings, depression, and drug dependency. My only wish is that this  DVD could have been longer. It is sensationalistic at times; even the photograph taken secretly of Elvis lying in state was included.
Poor Sheila Ryan struggled as she tried to discuss details of her relationship with Elvis without getting too intimate or graphic.  An interesting interview involved Don Wilson, who met Elvis when he was only 10 years old.  Other fascinating interviews were given by Elvis' female co-stars from his movie musicals. One thing for certain came out in almost all of the interviewees: they have the highest regard for Elvis, but Colonel Parker makes their blood run cold. I'm still dumbstruck at the movie roles Parker turned down, which could have made Elvis a major movie star.",1045267200,37,1012,4.976331360946745
