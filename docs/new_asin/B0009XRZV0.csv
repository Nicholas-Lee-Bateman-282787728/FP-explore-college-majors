The underwater camera work in Bermuda and footage in Africa is all stunning.

Part 1 contains segments titled Symbiosis (how sea life both relies on and maintains coral reef and vice versa), Changes, Movement and Destiny. Part 2 segments are Species, Adaptations, Irreducibility and Eternity.

The tone is both tasteful and bold. Very, very entertaining!!",1174694400,,504,5.5064935064935066
