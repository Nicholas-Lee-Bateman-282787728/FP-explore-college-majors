2285708,2,B0009ETCYW,"Definitely not adult fare, though perhaps suitable for young children. I expected more. The acting, with a few welcome exceptions, was stale.  There were some interesting landscapes and sets, but the special effects were weak, some reminding me of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"".",1202083200,4,281,5.386363636363637
2285709,4,B0009ETCYW,"This will not be everyone's cuppa tea. But I, personally, was pleasantly surprised. You just have to first remember that this is BASED ON AN EPIC POEM...thus, you have to watch it that way, like a story-story rather than a film-story--and somehow they pull it off without disconnecting (at least for me). Litefoot as Hiawatha might initially seem like he was strangely casted, but he's understated and convincing--definitely earned his role (and it's too bad he doesn't get more work these days). Adam Beach is great as the quirky BFF.

Sheila Tousey was miscast in my opinion (she was too young at the time to play a good grandmother role--clearly Tantoo was already booked), and while Irene Bedard is good (and looking smokin hot, I might add--I say this objectively as a fellow woman), I wasn't sure I was digging her take on Minnehaha. Also, the context--these 2 white trapper dudes being told the story by Sheila and Gordon--was jarring in the beginning, but somehow it eases into itself and it's not a problem. Overall, it's a very, very enjoyable film. Mad props for being successfully unHollywood and original on a low budget--and still being highly entertaining.",1199491200,57,1171,4.944162436548224
2285710,5,B0009ETCYW,"The Song of Hiawatha is an excellent movie.  I use it with my students (boys, grades 8-12) as a springboard for discussion of Native American ethics toward the environment.  They really enjoy it.",1192579200,26,195,4.878787878787879
2285711,5,B0009ETCYW,"I think it was nicely done. Being an elder who teaches Native traditions to the young, I would use this movie for children to watch. Certain aspects were incorrect, like the pony beads on the dresses as mentioned by another, but that can easily be rectified in a teaching setting.

2285712,2,B0009ETCYW,"Very slow and we lost interest.  Never even finished the entire movie.
The scenery is however beautiful.",1189814400,6,104,5.117647058823529
2285713,5,B0009ETCYW,"This movie is based on the poem, The Song of Hiawatha. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It gives you a sense of Native American culture and spirituality which is more believable since the Native Americans in the movie are portrayed by real Native American actors.  And what an amazing cast of actors.",1180569600,2,292,4.7254901960784315
2285714,5,B0009ETCYW,"Just as with Gulliver's Travels and Moll Flanders, Hollywood has once again couched a genuine literary classic within an outer tale outside the original.  Still, the film is essentially faithful to both Longfellow's epic poem and the Native American tradition.  Prophetically, just as did his contemporary James Fenimore Cooper (author of The Last of the Mohicans) so did Longfellow foresee and foretell the destruction of the Native American way of life.

The current movie of Hiawatha faithfully depicts a lost way of life for the Native Americans as it shows their efforts to survive climate conditions, famine,and war as well as their discoveries of corn and efforts at establishing peace among the tribes in the face of the encroaching white man.  This long departed microcosm is further enhanced by the outer tale with encroaching white men, one who understands and appreciates their way of life, and one who introduces materialism and dissention to the tribe.

The mystical visual effects underscore the Native American belief of a spirit world where messengers walk among ordinary people, often changing their lives, and then return to the spirit world.  The actors in this movie are highly successful in portraying the narrative Longfellow created.  The Native American characters are believable and the actors playing their parts capable of enabling the viewer to understand the plight of these characters.  They all coalesce to underscore the image of Hiawatha as a wise and chosen one, in touch with his inner self and the outer world that the spirits have shown him will be.  Of course, this internal harmony would not have been possible without the traditional dream vision, included in such varied movies as the Billy Jack series right up to Thunderheart and Smoke Signals, and even on the X files.

I loved this movie.  Having seen several of these actors in other movies with a strong Native American theme, I felt as if I were seeing some old friends.  Graham Greene is a classic actor, low key, witty, and wise. Russell Means brings sincerity and truth to his role, as does newcomer Lightfoot. Irene Bedard is a totally vivacious Minnehaha, and Adam Beach, a great friend and sidekick. Their presence also reassured me of the authenticity of presentation of the culture they portray. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to see a good movie or anyone wanting to know more of the early Native American culture or history as well as someone wanting to capture a piece of the literary view of Longfellow.  Gone is the tom-tom rhythm of his epic poem, but the tale is alive, entertaining, inspiring.",1177113600,11,2616,5.0
2285715,5,B0009ETCYW,"I liked the film very much, but you must read the book. I mean, watch the film first and then read the book. Read it out loud to an appreciative someone such as a child. Use rPaul Harvey (dramatic) voice when you read. I love the poetry... You don't get the poetry in the film.

I thought the costuming left a little to be desired. All the beadwork was done in pony (large) beads. Hallmark family rated.",1174262400,25,403,4.233766233766234
2285716,5,B0009ETCYW,"Wonderful movie, helped me to understand the Warrior spirit. I shared this film with a True Mohican Warrior, and he also felt this movie was very good.",971222400,19,151,4.62962962962963
2285726,5,B0009ETCYW,"If you can remember this is a tale, a story, and it's beautifully written and acted, I'm sure you'll love it . Pretend and enjoy. A movie everyone in the family will like, a rarity these days. Native Americans in the major parts are one of the keys. Well worth the purchase price; one of those movies you can watch over and over and not be afraid of it offending anyone or having to be embarrassed explaining any of it to the kids.",1425427200,,431,4.204819277108434

2285735,5,B0009ETCYW,we all loved this movie and were happily surprised by the content of the movie and we hate amazons rate it because they make us use too many words to explain our views just to make it look like there needs to be wasted tine and space when we can say as much in less space and words,1368144000,2,281,3.8620689655172415

2285738,5,B0009ETCYW,"For a biopic of a mostly fictitious character, it was written quite well, and acted even better.  I love Sheila Tousey in everything she's done, and she definitely didn't disappoint here.  Ditto for Graham Greene, who is one of my favorite actors of all time. Well worth watching, and well worth purchasing.",1346803200,,307,4.884615384615385
2285739,5,B0009ETCYW,Loved this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to watch American Indian movies.......I have watched it two timws already......,1323907200,,145,5.3478260869565215
2285740,5,B0009ETCYW,"As a professional storyteller ([...]) that often tells Native American stories, I truly appreciated the authenticity of this movie. The scenery was beautiful, the costuming excellent, the actors terrific. Several big name Native American actors are in here. Yes it was a low budget movie, but the story that is told is what is important, and that was very true to traditions and very enjoyable. For those that want a ""cowboys and indians shoot'em up"" this ain't it! For those that think they may want to watch this movie but have no experience with Native American stories, just read the back of the DVD case right before the movie and you will understand the complete plot. It is a long story, and it does move fast, so a little understanding beforehand is helpful. One could also read Longfellows poem beforehand, but that is not necessary.",1315008000,9,842,4.813793103448276
2285741,1,B0009ETCYW,"This movie doesn't make a lot of sense. The motivation of the principal actor remains completely unclear up to the very end of the movie. In addition, he looks more like a US Marine than a Native American. The only notable performances come from Adam Beach and the congenial Raul Trujillo. Trujillo would deserve to get better roles!",1251676800,7,333,4.758620689655173
2285742,3,B0009ETCYW,"Episodes are not well integrated - the story does not flow. Images are too literal and shallow. When the corn came and they tasted it they somehow knew exactly how to eat the kernels. If I had been presented with a strange new food such as an ear of corn, I would have taken a bite out of the top. Characters were never adequately developed to become real, and engaging. Situations failed to explore the depth of the poem. Maybe a good high school intro to the classic.",1246838400,7,469,4.340909090909091
2285743,5,B0009ETCYW,I loved this movie I hadn't seen it since I was eight. that was ten years ago.  this movie is amazing and aw-inspiring.  it really brings the peom to life. the actors are awesome.,1220832000,8,179,4.235294117647059

8059858,4,B0009ETCYW,"This was a Christmas present for my mother, here is her thoughts on the movie: I felt the movie warmly portrayed the relationships of the tribal community and the multi-layered connections between all the characters. I do wonder if the author used a well known story from the tribal community or if Longfellow came up with the storyline on his own. But I felt it was beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted.",1515542400,,408,4.76056338028169
