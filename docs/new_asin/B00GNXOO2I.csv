6094342,5,B00GNXOO2I,one of the scariest--,1413417600,,21,4.5
6094343,1,B00GNXOO2I,Both DVDs were scratched and the second DVD was loose in the package. The entire DVD case was bent as if someone had actually tried to bend it. I returned this item and won't likely shop with the seller again. I have seen these movies though and they are good movies.,1409875200,3,267,4.254901960784314
6094344,1,B00GNXOO2I,Why sell a DVD that you can't watch in this country?,1407974400,,52,3.8181818181818183
6094345,1,B00GNXOO2I,"How is it, I can log onto a North American website, maintained in the United States, by United States citizens, purchase a blu-ray, and have them send me one for another region of the world?

Why is this company selling blu-ray movies for a different part of this planet on a North American website?

Is there not enough to worry about when making purchases online?  Fraud, deception, theft, abuse?  Do I have to verify you're selling me something I can actually use in my HOME LAND?

What is next?  Sell me a toaster made for European 240V current?
 Seriously.........",1400112000,2,569,4.686868686868687

6094347,3,B00GNXOO2I,This is more like a statement to who it may concern: I tried ordering this and told I would be contacted about it when it was available. I still have no idea what's going on with that. I've tried to get on more then once.?,1390694400,2,222,3.9555555555555557
6094348,4,B00GNXOO2I,"Both of these films are great. The first Insidious is the scarier of the two. However, both films are equally creepy and disturbing.

6094349,5,B00GNXOO2I,"Foolishly neglected to notice the region setting on this one, but that's my bad.  Am now pricing multi-region DVD players...have wanted one anyway.  Watched both films on my computer and everything is great.  Made me a smarter Amazon shopper.  Thanks!",1463702400,2,251,5.2

6094358,1,B00GNXOO2I,"The Blue Ray was for a European machine. I didn't know there were different players for different parts of the world. I took off the shrinkwrap and popped the movie in and got the error message that it doesn't play in my player. Since I opened it I have no recourse. Buyer beware. I did send it back, but it's apparent my money is not going to be refunded. Live and learn. Too much fine print. No more Amazon for me.",1437004800,,416,4.148148148148148

6094368,1,B00GNXOO2I,This movie is only viewable in the UK. And perhaps the little detail of WRONG REGION should have been made more clear.  I even returned the movie as instructed and never received any thing in return. Not even a refund.,1415577600,9,218,4.45
