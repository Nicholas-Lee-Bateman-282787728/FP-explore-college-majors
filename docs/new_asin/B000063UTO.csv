7959909,5,B000063UTO,"Wish I could find this on DVD.  I fear my VHS copy will deteriorate soon.

I enjoyed this movie.  I'm a huge Ron Perlman fan (the reason why I watched this movie) and he never disappoints me.

But I also was intrigued with the story of the film.  It had an interesting concept.  I also enjoyed the soundtrack and the characters.",1392163200,,328,4.295081967213115
7959910,3,B000063UTO,"A scientist (Ron Perlman, always a solid performer, playing it with all the single minded focus of an MD who's shooting his own stuff, MD standing for Mad Doctor of course, so much for a ""control group"") creates a drug that allows people to go without sleep. It's being tested on military personnel at a remote desert training facility (of course). As you can imagine, people can't go without sleep, so as time goes on, their fears or guilt or whatever truly haunts them begin to bleed into their real life (of course), and this happens just as the program comes under the scrutiny of an outside analyst (of course). People with high caliber weapons hallucinating. Do the math/body count. Basically the average tv movie quality/formula rainy day movie.

Favorite line (spoken by the only member of the test group not to hallucinate): ""I grew up in the Bronx. What's left to be afraid of?""",1104278400,,888,4.7290322580645165
