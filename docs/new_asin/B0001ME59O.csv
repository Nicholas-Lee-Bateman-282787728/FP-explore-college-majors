8014738,5,B0001ME59O,I first discovered Dale Chihuly's work in a broadcast on PBS.  This video gives an interesting view into how he creates his work and then the process of putting it on display.,1356048000,2,175,4.46875
8014739,5,B0001ME59O,"I used this video to teach my Art Appreciation class. The video piqued my students'interest because part of it was about Garfield park and they live in the Chicago area. Most of them had no idea that art like this existed. Chihuly is a great glass artist and a great showman. Watching glass blown and turn from a huge hot blob into a beautiful, luminouse work of art is fascinating. The color in the video was lush. The timing of the scenes in the movie was really suited to tired evening students' attention span. The transitions from one project to the next were really well done. I have shown this video to two classes now and both have been very enthusiastic about it.",1306454400,,672,4.471544715447155
8014740,5,B0001ME59O,"Dale Chihuly's decades of exploring the relationship of glass and nature reach a zenith in 2002 at Chicago's historic Garfield Park Conservatory. But when did it truly begin? In Finland in 1995, or at Sleeping Lady in 1996? Or earlier, when Dale Chihuly was just a young boy in his mother's garden? The seeds for Chihuly in the Park: A Garden of Glass were sown in half dozen different nations, and this DVD explores the creative process that ultimately led to this extraordinary installation of glass in one of America's largest and oldest glasshouses. Follow behind the scenes as Chihuly and his team create and install glass sculptures among the plants at the revitalized urban conservatory. Ultimately, over 600,000 people visit what may be the perfect setting to experience Chihuly's organic work.
