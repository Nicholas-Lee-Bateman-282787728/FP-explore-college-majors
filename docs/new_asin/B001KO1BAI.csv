8315562,4,B001KO1BAI,"For Dario completists...  All the stories are worthwhile but made for tv...  And Dario doesn't translate well to a shorter run time and heavier restrictions...  Still if you love Dario you will want it.
MYA disk - so a little hinky....  But in this cas I don't believe it is MYA's fault...  The film sources were destroyed and only the vhs copies from the tv channel exist....  So no real ability to remaster...  It is sad, but this is most likely the best you are ever going to see.",1449878400,,483,4.359550561797753
8315563,5,B001KO1BAI,"I have been collecting Dario's and Mario Bava's  films since 1998 Although Dario only has one film and one doc on this disc, it is still top drawer!",1371859200,,148,4.285714285714286
8315564,5,B001KO1BAI,"I had to buy this 2 disc DVD set 3 times, and the only time I got a copy with 2 discs inside was when it didn't have a hole punched in the barcode. The other two copies I bought previously DID have a hole punched in the barcode. I would strongly urge everyone to avoid purchasing this DVD with a hole punched in the barcode!",1256342400,9,324,3.9242424242424243
8315565,5,B001KO1BAI,great made for italian tv miniseries. four stories presented by argento like sterling did with twilight zone and night gallery. highly recommend. don't expect  gore and blood but expect to be satisfied. lost argento classic.,1255824000,2,224,5.4
8315566,2,B001KO1BAI,"I think this mini-series was disappointing considering Dario Argento directed 2 of the episodes. I only liked 1 episode which was ""Eyewitness"". I find the rest boring with no suspense or anything interesting happening. I also didn`t like the stories of the other episodes.

As being said in the other reviews here, the picture quailty is nothing to brag about. If you buy this series as a Dario Argento fan, i think you will be disappointed.",1252022400,,441,4.802631578947368
8315567,4,B001KO1BAI,"This was taken from video masters rather than film masters, because the film masters have been lost. Hence the less than crystal clear video presentation offered. This is still completely watchable though, and at least it is even on dvd. Quit your bitchin'. Now the shows go more for suspense than Argento's usual blood and gore but this WAS television. One can only imagine the heights  Door might have scaled had this gone on for more seasons. But I for one am glad to have this at all.",1234828800,16,488,4.545454545454546
8315568,2,B001KO1BAI,"I was very excited to finally have these episodes in my hand, but I guess my expectations were a little too high. I know these were filmed for television, but they just lack the violence I would naturally be looking for in an Argento related title.

The stories are not bad, they have the writing styles of Bird With the Crystal Plumage and Cat O' Nine Tails, but they tend to drag a bit, with a lot of talking.

As for the film quality, that gets about a 3 out of 10, and I agree with the last reviewer that this dvd set should have been more in the $19.99 dollar range, if that, than the $26 bones it is priced at. The quality looks (and states before the episodes) that they are from original television video transfers, as the originals are gone. So its like watching an old vhs that has been played over and over again, only though a dvd player. Poor quality and sound.

If you are a huge Argento fan for his works in horror, this may or may not fit your needs. For me, they are decent suspense stories, but nothing more.",1234224000,11,1026,4.197969543147208
8315569,4,B001KO1BAI,"I have to start by saying that I do appreciate Dario Argento and all of his tremendous contributions to the horror genre.  That being said, from the first time I saw Suspiria, I pretty much buy everything Argento (including Asia, Fiore, Salvator. . . ) that I can find -and/or afford.  I do enjoy all of the films, whether it be for camera work, style, color, acting (or a lack thereof), location, etc.  I immediately puchased Door Into Darkness the first day it was released - and although I'm still on the first story, I'm a bit disappointed with the quality.  I am not much of a critic - I do like having access to these gems for my collection (comprised of approximately 3,000 movies on dvd alone), but it would be nice for the quality to be a bit better for 26.99.  Maybe I'm just a bit particular, and maybe I should just be happy it has been released!  It just seems to me that I have come across bootlegs that rival the quality of this disc.  And I'm excited for the release of 4 Flies on Grey Velvet, and I'm wondering what the quality of that disc will be like.  .  . .",1233187200,7,1079,4.224390243902439
