7108660,5,B00VTDQT1Q,"I love the Mission Impossible series like everyone else, however as a person who appreciates QUALITY Blu-ray mastering, I was very disappointed that disc 1 of this 4-disc set appears that it was originally scanned from a FILM master than than a DIGITAL master. You can clearly tell this because if you watch ANY scene on ANY disc there are abundant film artifacts (hair, scratches, etc) wherever the frame is dark. Someone at least could have gone through and cleaned up the scanned frames manually, but apparently that was too much work. Not the typical Blu-ray quality modern audiences expect on their big, at-home screens.

Disc 2 is somewhat grainy sadly, but disk 3 and 4 are properly mastered.

For these reasons I would recommend that true aficionados pay a little more money and purchase each disc individually from a better source.",1446249600,8,840,4.908450704225352

8711148,1,B00VTDQT1Q,"When watching these movies, you might see an enjoyable action spy thriller, but that is not what the movies are supposed to be. The original Mission Impossible series was an intellectual spy thriller, where the point of the mission was to convince the villains to destroy themselves without ever realizing that there was an enemy acting against them. If the mission was to hang a man, Jim, Rollin and Cinnamon would have tricked the target into walking onto the gallows Barney and Willy had constructed and putting the noose on of his own free will, and the guy would never know what happened until Jim pulled the lever. Ethan Hunt would require an outrageous martial arts duel and some sort of acrobatic insanity (Case in point: In the original show, cable drops were used a grand total of 2 times in 200 episodes, and outside of a handful of episodes where the fight was a key part of the plan, any battle more complex than hitting a guard over the head meant something had gone very wrong).

Hollywood took the name Mission Impossible, borrowed some of the more famous elements (the masks, the gadgets, the self-destructing briefing tapes), and then created something that made it clear that the scriptwriters never watched the show they were supposed to be turning into a movie. The cast of the show was so appalled by this (and what they did to the one character who carried over from the show) that they walked out of the premiere. As a fan of the original series, I cannot accept the films as something worthy of the Mission Impossible name.",1479340800,,1548,4.670329670329671
