2441347,1,B000BTPVA4,"Each year I add movies to our large  Christmas movie collection.  Based on the description and reviews, I purchased this movie last year.  My teenage daughter and I sat down to watch it, only to turn it off shortly after it began.  We kept hoping it would get better, but unfortunately the weak story line and poor music (It is a musical.) failed to hold our interest. Perhaps a younger viewing audience might find it amusing, but certainly not teens or adults.  Keep that in mind if you do decide to purchase. I plan to give our DVD away this year, and have no desire to even finish viewing it.",1254700800,11,595,4.372727272727273
2441348,5,B000BTPVA4,"This is a wonderful Christian Christmas DVD.  It has a story line, music, great video, and actual artists performing Christmas music in it.  The children at my church will enjoy this video at one of our evening activities while there parents are shopping.

Thank you.

8092705,2,B000BTPVA4,"The seller sent this promptly and in good condition, but I could not view it since it was not in closed caption.  I have seen it on TV in closed caption and wanted, very much to have it in my home collection.",1403049600,,208,3.9523809523809526
8092706,3,B000BTPVA4,"This is a good movie for teaching Children. It was somewhat hard for me to get into as it seemed a bit more for the country western type of person which I am not. But it has a lot of good lessons and wonderful ideas that are brought out in songs and unique ideas for Christmas. I could even see where different areas of it could be used other times of the year as part of bible lessons at Sunday School if someone wanted to. It was rather dry in spots and very good in others, I gave it 3 stars because of running hot and cold this way.",1356307200,,536,3.926605504587156
8092707,3,B000BTPVA4,This is an okay dvd. It is not the kind of movie you would thik it is. It is more like a play acting type show.,1294704000,,111,3.3076923076923075
8092708,1,B000BTPVA4,"Our family was highly disappointed in this DVD.  The description leads one to think it is a movie.  It is not.  It is a play acted out by a church which is also a musical.  It is poor quality and we were very disappointed in the music. In fairness we watched the entire episode though it was difficult to get through. We wanted to turn it off within 10 minutes and several times the children said, turn it off.  The message was good but was over shadowed by all the chaos in the movie. If putting on a CHRISTmas program is that much choas---it seems to take CHRIST out of CHRISTmas and the real reason we celebrate CHRISTmas.  The dress of the lead woman singer was very immodest which was pointed out by my 11 and 8 year old.  I am mad at myself for wasting the money for this DVD.  Very misleading and definitely not worth the price.

With that said.  I am sure the people involved in this production were fully commited to it.  In no way would I put down their desire to get a message of CHRIST's love and forgiveness but the truth of the matter is it was misrepresented and should be listed as a church musical program.  Nothing more.",1290902400,4,1138,4.241860465116279
8092709,4,B000BTPVA4,This movie was a bit corny but very enjoyable.  Good music and the real meaning of Christmas stressed in a movie that is good length for showing to a group of either children or adults.,1261526400,4,185,4.285714285714286
