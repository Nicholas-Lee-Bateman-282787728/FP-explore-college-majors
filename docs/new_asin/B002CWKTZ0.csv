This Bolshoi gala in Moscow was a fundraising event for the victims of the 1988 Armenian earthquake.  And if I thought one red cent (or even one capitalist cent) would be diverted from a humanitarian cause, I would never write a negative review.  But that was 28 years ago, and I tend to think no more money is being disbursed to that particular cause.  Just a little trickle into the distributors' pockets.  And therefore I believe this DVD must now stand on its own merits, if any.

OK, I don't mind that it's a little darkish with off-kilter color and constricted TV sound.  From what I read on Amazon, most people would scream about that and leave the rest alone, but it's really the least of my concerns.  Also I don't mind the faux ballroom curtains with no fewer than 7 gigantic chandeliers overhanging the stage.  It's garish and kitschy, something Lawrence Welk might dream about in champagne paradise.  I don't mind any of that, rather I recognize it as an, eh, allowable cultural difference--Eastern European elegance, possibly mockable in James Bond movies, but definitely not by me :)

I just like a good musical program.  OK, what we have here are three main classes of singers.  (A) Old-timers, that is, mainstream opera megastars well past retirement, who with all due respect should have declined to become embarrassed.  And that is because, with all due respect, they are terrible, painful to listen to.  These well-beloved veterans of the international stage include no less than Carlo Bergonzi, Hermann Prey, and Alfredo Kraus.  Bless their hearts, I don't want to say anything bad about them.  Suffice it to say, other than possibly Kraus, they were not actively performing at this late date, and frankly ... I just wish I hadn't heard them here.  Some things can't be unheard once they've been heard, etc.  I refuse to go into more detail, but they are one reason for the low rating.

(B) The next class of singers is a few young no-names from Western Europe who are doing some of the staples.  Of course I realize, although they were no-names in 1988, that was a long time ago and maybe they are no longer young no-names, maybe now they are old no-names.  Well, I don't claim to know everyone by any means, but I never heard of them, either then nor now.  Anyway ... the point is, I am tired of hearing young no-names doing standard repertoire.  Let them do unknown stuff for a change, so we don't have to keep comparing them to Schwarzkopf etc.  And also, if I wanted to go listen to young no-names, I know the way to San Jose and I can do it right here.  Turning on the TV for the Bolshoi gala seems a strange source for that, don't you think?

(C) The final class is some good-ole-fashioned Russian stars doing some good-ole-fashioned Russian repertoire.  Now THIS is what the average comrade tunes into the Bolshoi to hear.  And these singers include even the great Yevgeny Nesterenko doing the Mussorgsky 'Song of the Flea' (which frankly is the one and only thing on this DVD worth tuning in to hear).

Or I should say, it WOULD be the only thing worth tuning in to hear, except for the final indignity, and that is, the dam-bleepin' video is out of synch with the soundtrack!  So we are watching Nesterenko doing the Flea song, and the sound is heard, with the consonants fully formed, BEFORE the picture shows his lips forming them!  This is really, really, really, REALLY annoying and do I have to say, unnatural, and not to mention, physically impossible.

So after all that, the insignificant fact that there are no subtitles in any language, nor any commentary ... all that is moot.  So I did sit thru the whole program, gritting my teeth and praying I could make it to the end, and I somehow did, and it was better after it ended.

Addendum.  Mark Ermler has been one of my favorite conductors since years before this video was made, and this was the first time I ever got to see him in action.  How ironic!  I still like Mark Ermler.  I was surprised to see he appears to be a normal, genteel, smiling human being.  His portrait photo in the old Melodiya Prince Igor set was so stern and joyless!  I notice he has passed on, in 2002.  I also note he was conductor of the Seoul Philharmonic in later years.  How interesting!  I wonder how he communicated with them?  English, I suppose?

UPDATE:  Now that I have a sound-delay box, I estimate the synch is off about 100 ms.  I wouldn't have minded watching it again now and correcting the synch, but I am not about to go buy it again ...",1473379200,,4636,4.522262334536703
