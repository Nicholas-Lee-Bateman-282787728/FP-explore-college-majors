3414726,4,B0018BA758,"First I must say I loved the first Nana Movie, it ranks right next to Linda Linda Linda. Nana 2 was not as upbeat as the first, possible because my favorite characters, Nana (Hachi)and Ren were played by other actors. I thought that the chemistry between Nana and Ren made the first movie, Ren in the second was not as close to Nana, they seemed somewhat distant. I thought that Nana (Hachi) should have ended up with Nobu in the second because their personalities fit each other. But she ended up with pretty boy Takumi. The story was much stronger in the first Nana,
Nana 2 was more about Nana's(Hachi)loves and how it affected the band.
But I loved both movies, the first more than the second though.",1233878400,4,703,4.5
3414727,4,B0018BA758,"The second movie is a vast improvement from the first movie. Not that the first movie was bad, but they obviously received a much bigger budget the second time around. Visually, the cinematography is stunning, with an abundance of clear, crisp and beautiful shots around Japan. The second movie stays very true to the manga as well, with the exception of leaving out a particular storyline. But I find that most movie adaptations of literature leave out various details, it's just something that commonly happens between the transfer of mediums, and understandably so (live-action adaptations have time constraints). If they had included all of the details of the manga, the movie would surely seem crammed, so I don't mind the absense of details here. The acting in the movie was also stellar and quite believable, and the humor/comedy of Ai Yazawa's original work remains in tact as well. I felt this was tragically missing from the first movie.

Overall, excellent adaptation of the manga. The characters were chosen well, the music is entertaining and appropriate, and the plot moves at a great pace so you remain invested in the story. My one, admittedly petty, complaint is that the actress who played Hachi in the first movie (Aoi Miyazaki) was much, much cuter and more ""Hachi-like"" than Yui Ichikawa, who plays her in the second movie. Ichikawa did a fine job acting, she just isn't nearly as cute, and Hachi is very cute... I know she can't help that. Sorry. (I said it was petty).  :) Kenichi Matsuyama also does not make a second appearance in movie 2, and instead Kanata Hongo takes on the role of Shin. I am a huge fan of Matsuyama, but this switch is preferred, as he was really too old to play the role of Shin. This was a good switch.

If you're a Nana fan, this must be apart of your Ai Yazawa collection.",1232064000,9,1823,4.690625

3414729,5,B0018BA758,I love love love this show. It does get a little bit darker or sadder as the sessions progress but it is worth being depressed over lol. It isn't like a lot of traditional anime. Much more adult and girly,1402963200,,204,4.125

3414732,5,B0018BA758,the story line is very similar to the first movie but it is a very good extension of the first. you can easily see how the girls lives  will go after the end of the movie.,1373241600,,171,3.75

I may be wrong, but I don't believe so. If you are truly friends, I don't believe that one would continually miss seeing old friends for a yearly reunion. It seemed like Nana the singer dropped her old friends.",1369612800,,367,3.972972972972973
3414735,5,B0018BA758,"No dropping of the ball happened in this season when compared to season one.  In fact, the season switches are so seamless that season 1 & 2 could have been one large season by themselves. I will definitely be purchasing Nana Season 3.  I'm so addicted to this anime at this point!",1368921600,,281,4.384615384615385
3414736,5,B0018BA758,"I wasn't aware that there was a follow-up to the movie ""Nana"" until I accidently came across this item on amazon. It piqued my interest and I ordered it right away. What a welcome change from the original. It does still contain the original characters, but it really changes the course of the story. I was saddened, yet I understood the reality of such changes. It was about growing up. And these two girls go through a significant amount of growing up in this film. At the end I must say I did enjoy it. I loved it so it so much that I ordered a copy of this DVD and its prequel ""Nana"" and donated them to the local branch library in my neighborhood area so that others may enjoy these two movies. A well-executed film with much to consider.",1366502400,,742,4.2695035460992905
3414737,4,B0018BA758,"It didn't come across to me as good as everyone brags it to be, however it is a very well put together series. If you really love ""a piece of life"" animes, this one is for you.

I did enjoy the anime, the music, and the drama. It's worth watching at least once. As far as wow factors, the only one that wowed me was on the very last episode of box set 4. It was so piece of life, that it hurt yet you still liked the ending.",1365292800,,424,3.764044943820225
3414738,4,B0018BA758,"Nana K. is having troubles with her boyfriend, Shoji. Her suspicions are confirmed when she catches him cheating on her. Fortunately, she has some great friends around to lift her spirits. The 2 Nana's take a trip to see a Trapnest concert, where Nana O. rekindles her old relationship with Ren. Now that Nana O. is back in the arms of Ren, Nana K. gets a chance to meet the Tranpnest bassist. Her wounded heart allows Takumi to talk her into sleeping with him. Now she is infatuated with a man that seems like a slimeball, and the guy who really cares for her is heartbroken.

This volume is pretty good. It's hard to say whether I liked it better than volume 1. They are both good, but totally different. I think that the show is definitely getting better at this point. You know a show is good when you want to get inside it and dry one of the character's tears or kick another character's ass. I'm totally glad that I saw this volume, and can't wait to see the rest of the series. I highly recommend it to any anime fan over the age of 16, there is a little bit of adult stuff in Nana, but it's not as much as the rating suggests.",1360368000,,1134,4.225806451612903

3414742,3,B0018BA758,"Spoilers Galore. Tread with caution if you haven't read the manga:

I really liked Nana, the first flick based on the popular manga about two Japanese gals, both named Nana, who end up via coincidence/fate becoming roommates, then best friends. Both girls have serious relationship issues and both end up suffering setbacks. Together, though, they find a harbor with each other and start to move toward love again. The first flick had Ryuhei Matsuda as Ren, and while he's not as handsome  as the taller actor who plays Ren in Nana 2, Matsuda was actually a more compelling presence and had real chemistry in his scenes with Mika in Nana 1.

In Nana 2, rocker Nana's career starts to move forward, which is nice, but I get nuts about how she still keeps a distance from Ren,who clearly loves her and wants he to live with him. I do not get this girl and her pride, but pride is her main failing and it continues to be an obstacle. The other Nana (Hachi) turns into this really mushy, submissive, nothing, and it's horrible to watch. Really horrible. Here was this energetic, bouncy gal without much in terms of accomplishment (other than being a super cook and chipper cute gal), and in the face of meeting a mystifyingly distant one minute and mystifyingly insightful lover the next dream guy (played by the uberhottie Tetsuji Tamayama, who frankly gives me the vapors he's so hot), she turns into an aproned soulless mistress. Ick. My skin crawls.

And yet, we do understand why she chooses the hottie rich rocker over Nobu. Nobu is sweet, funny, endearing, thoughtful and very easy to like. We think, ""Oh, surely she's gonna pick him."" But no. She picks the broody, thoughtless, but insightful hottie. And explains why. And, yes, we get it, but I still hated that she did.

Nuff said.

I loved the Hyde song they used in the first film, a terrifically catchy song you keep singing after the movie is over, performed very nicely by the Black Stones (the group in the flick of which Nana is the frontwoman). Glamourous Sky. (Do head over to youtube and search for the live performance by Hyde, shirtless, with Kaz on guitar, which is a real treat.) No song in this film caught my fancy. Pity.

I agree with the previous commenters that the original Hachi had a certain charm and cute factor that was more muted in Hachi in Nana 2. Mika Nakashima may not be the greatest actress and all, but I think she does a really good job portraying Nana (the rocker), with her pencil-thin legs and arms and moody expressions. I love the scene where she comforts Nobu in the street after revealing to him a painful plot twist.

I missed the delectably upper-lipped Kenichi Matsuyama, but the boyish actor cast as the bassist was quite adorably gangly and sweet.

I wish they'd given Ren more screen time. Seems to me he was short-shrifted, and that actor was a hottie giving Takumi a visual run for the money.

Really, if you like hot Japanese boys, this is a good film to catch some eye candy. If you like romantic themes and stories with musicians who will perform for you, this will do that. But be prepared to wanna slap both these gals upside the head for some of their choices.

And overall, it's enjoyable, if lacking some of the drive of Nana, the first.",1270944000,3,3250,4.576592082616179
3414743,3,B0018BA758,"I loved the first Nana movie. The chemistry between all the actors was wonderful, and it was interesting to see how both Nanas grew and evolved over time.

In Nana 2, the Nanas are not as strong. Perhaps it's because the new Nana ""Hachi"" Komatsu, Yui Ichikawa, wasn't as exuberent and mercurial as the original.

Or maybe it's that I was disappointed in how the character turned out. She had an opportunity to seize her dream lover and she took it. But thereafter, she seemed to melt into the background.

For me, the clincher in making this a lesser movie than the first is that the Nanas spent most of their time talking to each other on the telephone rather than interacting directly. Their relationship really sold the first movie's core. Without it, the heart of the film is missing.

And, too, I found myself disappointed that strong, independent Nana Osaki advises ""Hachi"" that if she stays with Takumi, she'd have to just put up with him sleeping around while he traveled with Trapnest. Seriously? That is so not what I'd have expected her to say.",1270425600,,1055,4.655913978494624
3414744,5,B0018BA758,"This anime brings back many memories of what it was like to be 20-something and not know what I wanted to do with my life. Sometimes I thought I did know, but most of the time -- NOT!!!  These two Nana's are young women who want fame, fortune and love, but maybe not in that order.  Seems like they're impatient and want it all now.  I can relate.  This DVD set is good for those who are 20-something, or those who want to get together with their girlfriends and reminiscence about their college days gone by...

By the way, Volume 3 comes out on February 2nd!!!!  Happy ordering!",1263772800,6,580,4.324074074074074
3414745,4,B0018BA758,"While the series suffers from weak comedic writing, the level of depth and reality in the series is fantastic. The music in NANA continues to be very well done and only adds to the high level of quality along with the art and animation. The DVD set suffers from a severe lack of extras and a steep price for only a few episodes; however, if you can look past that the series is worth owning. The English and Japanese tracks are both excellent.",1263340800,3,443,4.349397590361446
3414746,5,B0018BA758,"I did not buy this one, but however I bought the Nana boxset 47 episodes and 3 ovas online for only 45 dollars. The only things that are in english were the menus and the subtitles. It came from japan itself, so I am very happy to own an original boxset of the Nana series. It is my favorite anime series, and if you are into romance and drama, this is for you.

It starts as two different girls both named Nana meet on a train, they are both going to Tokyo. They talk for a few hours, then don't see each other for awhile. Then they both run into each other AGAIN when they are both looking at the same apartment to buy. They end up becoming roommates and a huge bond of friendship forms. The series is about how they tie into each other's lives as they both go through romance and their own dreams to get to where they want to be, but keep their friendship strong through everything.

It offers real life situations of drama and romance. The emotions are deep and pure, and will even leave tears.
This is one series I highly recomend. You will love it. The story of these girls will be ones you can relate to.",1260230400,3,1111,4.162790697674419
