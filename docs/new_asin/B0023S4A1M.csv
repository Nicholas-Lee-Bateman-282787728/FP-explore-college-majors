3842053,3,B0023S4A1M,"Now, I liked this and all, butit had moments where u would think that fight scenes were about to happen. Evidentally not. I found this to be for tha laid back type of person that just accepts any anime instead of a specific genre. Now, I can watch any type of anime and i like all kinds (except comedy)it just depends on what type of mood I'm in to watch a certain anime. I was thinking this anime would be a mix genre of anime, and it sort of was and sort of wasn't. The reason i say that is because there is times where it focuses on just one type of genre (comedy and action)but there was some episodes that had a mix of action, romance, and comedy but that was short on the action scenes interuppted by comedy with the main character. The action scenes were short that did not suprise me at all though since it is 13 episodes, but it could've had longer fights to make up for the comedy. Now, I will say i don't mind it mixing the genres up, but once you're seeing a action scene of fighting and it skips to comedy or something and it switches back to the action scene it is always short in this series. Nonetheless, I'm not bashing this anime at all. I just think there is WAY better anime out there for certain type of anime genre lovers. Now for the good thing, i found the dub to be ok, but i switched to sub but they are both about even imo. The comedy is kind of funny. The last episode kind of suprised me and it almost made me cry until the very last part, but overall it was opk :). 3 stars",1292803200,2,1503,4.046979865771812

3842055,4,B0023S4A1M,"Whether or not you will like this Anime depends on what you are looking for.

If you are looking for silly humor, and don't care about a deep story line, you'll probably like this one.

The main character is a bit clueless about all the women he's surrounded by, which is the basis of most of the humor of the series.  At its core, the Anime is a classic harem / boy who doesn't seem to notice girls scenario.

If this doesn't sound like what you are looking for, I would not recommend this Anime.",1281052800,15,497,4.2

 BTW: I've noticed a number of reviewers complaining about not being able to skip thru the Funimation ads that appear right after the FBI warning on the front of the disk. I too find these to take away from watching the DVD. I have found on my player that if you press stop when you see the FBI warning and then press the DVD root menu key, you skip the ad. I'm not sure this will work on all DVD player models but it does on my Philips.",1335484800,,623,3.8671875

  This is an alternate Meiji era where supernatural ""monsters"" can get licenses to live and work among normal humans. There are plenty of anachronisms, but it is supposed to be an alternate history. The story revolves around the Mobile Shinsengumi, all female descendants of the Shinsengumi of the Revolution. They take on jobs bringing in unlicensed monsters as a sort of pseudo-police force. They generally cause more damage and mischief than they prevent, and have run up quite a debt in reparations. Enter the main character, Ryunosuke. The son of the owner of the Mobile Shinsengumi he was sent to China (Shang-hai) at an early age to study modern society and how it can be brought to Japan. He returns and causes a bit of mayhem unwittingly, but makes friends easily and begins to get the debt down. Through all there are monsters, a rival company with questionable motives and an attempt by the girls of the Mobile Shinsengumi to ""hook-up"" Ryunosuke and get him married so he won't return to Shang-hai on whatever ""unfinished business"" he has. Shang-hai comes to him, in the form of a fiancee and a bad-guy that's after both of them, looks vaguely like a pork bun and is named ""Yaba""... don't cringe Star Wars fans, it's not so bad... The ""Paul Linde"" like voice of Ryunosuke's companion Nekomaru is hilarious as well.
  While not a great masterpiece of intellectual literature, this is definitely worth watching. A good mix of a little of everything that worked out well. I'd call it average, which means as good or better than most.",1294099200,6,1938,5.015625
