8705937,3,B00UGPQFGC,"Ok maybe its the worst of the 4 (soon to be 5) Jurassic Park movies they've made so far, but still worth having in the collection. The plot overall is fairly weak for one of these, but actually has once of the cooler scenes out of all these movies when they're in the flying reptiles exhibit (it gets tiring always seeing Raptors in tall grass in every one of these). Enjoy!",1522195200,,374,4.28169014084507
