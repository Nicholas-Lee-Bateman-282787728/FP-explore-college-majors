If you've been a fan the past several years but not 20-25 years ago, you're in for a treat!  Wish 2 early concert appearances on Austin City Limits & concert on old Nashville TV network would come out on DVDs! Fortunately I have VCR tapes of them.",1282521600,2,424,4.072289156626506

4188290,5,B003SH6EPM,"This is Great DVD with a performance by a younger George Strait. Performed (Live) and filmed in Dallas, Texas on New Year's Eve/Day (1986/1987. A great DVD to add to any Country Music or George Strait fans collection. Georges performances get better as time goes on. See his other live DVDs. Great entertainment by the one and only ""George Strait"" that still keeps country music traditional, do I need to I say anymore.",1448323200,,419,4.7534246575342465
4188291,5,B003SH6EPM,"This George Strait in 1986. New Years Eve. It had been released before on VHS. If you're someone not accustomed to seeing concert videos from this time period it may not be for you. If you absolutely must see George in HD/Surround Sound..... this is not the DVD for you. But those of us old enough to appreciate good things, regardless of the technology involved, will certainly enjoy this. I am Texas native from the Dallas - Ft. Worth area, and this particular show was recorded at one of my favorite venues, which is no longer standing.... Reunion Arena. I saw many great concerts over the years there.
Those considering buying this DVD must consider the time it was recorded, the material Strait had up to that point, etc... But contained within this DVD is a fine vintage George Strait performance. The stage is pretty bare, the light show is pretty basic, there no flashy video wall behind the band, no moving lights, no lasers, no fog machines, and no confetti cannons. It's just essentially a honky-tonk bar band playing just as they had in smaller venues.... but as George got bigger, there was really no need to add the flashy stuff that bands use today. Bands big enough to play arenas today, absolutely cannot survive and hold onto an audience without all the flashy stuff. It didn't use to be that way. It used to be about seeing the band and hearing the music period.  That's what you get with this DVD, it's simply a music experience the way it used to be. The audio mix is really good, the song selection is good, the band is killer.... so I highly recommend this DVD based on those things.",1442361600,,1606,4.557093425605537

4188319,5,B003SH6EPM,"This is a great DVD of a young Strait in concert, if your a George Strait fan.  A calm and easy presence on stage singing some of his early work.  He interacts with the audience with class.  I also liked how the audience would quiet down when he was singing a slower or romance song rather than just screaming their heads off, , something that is annoying in today's big venue concerts.  This is a no nonsense concert done the way they used to be without all the flash and electronics.  The 5 bonus tracks at the end are a treat, especially the last two showing Strait at an older age..guessing one from the 90's and the last sometime in the mid 2000's. George Strait is a real cowboy and ranch owner and it comes across.  Buy it..you'll love it.",1402617600,6,746,4.292857142857143

4188324,2,B003SH6EPM,"I find Amazons listing of this DVD to be somewhat deceiving. "" Live (2010) "".  I purchased this thinking it would have some of his newer stuff on it.  His old is good, but it's more honky tonk than I like.  I thought I was buying a DVD from a 2010 performance.  So I'm disappointed with Amazons listing.  They should at least put in parentheses below the 2010 (from a 1986 concert).",1387411200,3,382,4.25

4188328,5,B003SH6EPM,This was an earlier George Strait performance and when I became a fan for life.  I like the honky tonk songs he sang and the way his voice got around them.  He is the Frank Sinatra of Country music and true to the cause. He has a great band around him which he kept all through his career.  The best way to describe his is the way Garth Brooks did.  He's sweet.,1369008000,,361,3.9722222222222223
4188329,5,B003SH6EPM,It has some of George's earlier songs that I miss hearing.  I would recommend this to any G. Strait fan.,1368057600,,104,4.2
4188330,5,B003SH6EPM,I have been a fan of George Strait since 1982.  He just gets better.  I have been to numerous concerts.  It is good to have them on CD so we can watch them often.,1367366400,,162,3.7058823529411766

4188337,5,B003SH6EPM,"Enough Said.  After going back in time and wondering ""Did I look like that back then????"" I was mesmerized by the magic of George Strait. His music is seemingly timeless.  This playlist would be successful 2012 New Year's.  In fact it was!!!",1358640000,,241,4.690476190476191
4188338,5,B003SH6EPM,"For any country music fan, this is fantastic. George Strait seems like such a nice guy, has an aborable smile & an outstanding voice. Unlike many, I always listen to the words of songs as well as the music & the content of his songs: some make me smile, many move me, many are just playful...all are a delight. Worth purchasing!!!",1357948800,,330,4.426229508196721
4188339,5,B003SH6EPM,Who doesn't love George Strait?  He is a throw back to earlier generations of country artists while still able to keep up with the younguns.  I love this concert & I really love that he sounds the very same live as he does on CD.,1341532800,,229,4.066666666666666
4188340,5,B003SH6EPM,"I have but one regret. It took me until 1991 to discover George Strait.  I was in pharmacy school and too busy studying to pay attention to the talent that George was given.  I have seen this guy 5 times, no matter what I pay to be up front, its worth it.  We love you George. Congratulations on being a Grandpa!!!!!!!!!  Hi Bubba, Norma, Tamara and Baby!!!!!!!!!",1329523200,,363,4.373134328358209
4188341,2,B003SH6EPM,"This was not the music cd I thought it would be.  Very disapointed in the songs.  Maybe I purchased the wrong one.  It has been so long I can't remember.  It doesn't have all or even most of his hit songs.  Becareful to read the songs before purchasing this cd, and if it doesn't tell you the songs, don't buy it.  Love George Straigt tho.  Will keep it, but probally won't listen to it much. :(",1324771200,,395,4.118421052631579

4188344,5,B003SH6EPM,"Although this was filmed in the 80's it never came out in New Zealand. What an excellent concert and how those songs now 20 years later are just as popular as ever. The video extras were very interesting on how the format has changed over the years. The last video was very recent and was magic.  I hope Universal filmed the whole show and will put a new concert DVD out.

In fact lets be honest George Strait is so good Universal should put a DVD out after every big new concert tour he does. Universal did this with Johnny Hallyday in France and I must have around 15 concert DVD of his. George Strait is too important an Artist to just have only 2 concerts out for viewing.",1292716800,11,676,4.232558139534884

4188346,5,B003SH6EPM,"This was filmed in Dallas, Texas on New Year's Eve/Day (1986/1987), showing a young George Strait, performing with his ""Ace in the Hole"" Band. They ""bring in"" the New Year of 1987 during this concert dvd. This is a 2010, new re-issue of that concert, on DVD for the first time.  I really enjoyed ""Amarillo By Morning"", ""All My Ex's Live in Texas"", and ""Marina Del Rey"". The other songs are good also. There are a total of 16 songs in the live concert.

Since the Amazon Product Description does not list the song set, then I will.
The songs are as follows:

1. The Fireman
2. Deep Water
3. The Cowboy Rides Away
4. Hot Burning Flames
5. Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind
6. Dance Time in Texas
7. You're Something Special to Me
8. Six Pack To Go
9. Nobody in his Right Mind Would've left Her
10. Amarillo by Morning
11. All My Ex's Live in Texas
12. Rhythm of the Road
13. Any Old Time
14. You Look So Good In Love
15. Marina Del Rey
16. Unwound

This DVD also contains 5 music videos. I really loved the video of ""Amarillo By Morning"". It shows rodeo cowboys, performing in rodeos, such as bull riding, bronc riding, steer wrestling, and etc. It's a great video. The other videos are pretty good also.

The Videos are as follows:
1. Amarillo by Morning
2. The Chair
3. Check Yes or No
4. She'll Leave You With a Smile
5. Living For the Night (this video shows an older, more mature George Strait)

Overall, this is great, early, footage, of George Strait, both in concert & in videos. It's definitely worth the purchase price. If you like George Strait, you'll love this one for sure. I hope this review has been helpful. Thanks!!!",1284076800,36,1635,4.326797385620915
