8684352,5,B003ASVFQM,"I have owned my Ford Tractor for a couple years now.  I was having problems that seemed like my engine was always being flooded.  My father-in-law told me he suspected the carburetor so, I decided to take on rebuilding it all on my own!  Halfway through the project I felt I could use some additional help, and this video was perfect.  They work through things at a reasonable pace (you can always pause as well) and even share a bunch of cost saving tips and tricks along the way.  I highly recommend this video to anyone.",1347321600,,523,4.40625
