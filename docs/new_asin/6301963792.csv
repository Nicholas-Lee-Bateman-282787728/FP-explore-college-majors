7819347,1,6301963792,"I have this movie on a 20 movie Sci-Fi compilation.  On that it is known as ""They"".  And let me tell you, THEY suck!  This is some of the worst acting and special effects known to moviedom.

It says here yoy can buy this on VHS for $40.  First, that's already more than I paid for 19 other movies and this and certainly more than I would be willing to pay for a VHS players.  Second, after seeing these reviews, Why would you? If you want to just get rid of your money, feel free to send it to me.  I'll save you the trouble.

To make matters worse, the rip-off Ennio Morricone Spaghetti Western music is pathetic.  But it's the incidental music that throws this over the edge.  Silence IS golden.  Too bad THEY forgot to remember that.",1505001600,,736,4.223021582733813
7819348,3,6301963792,"I saw this movie as a kid on TV when it was released, and it fascinated me. I never saw a film like it ever. It redefines film like Manos Hands of Fate, and Eraserhead. People arrive by plane around the age of 20, sit in a cabin, and talk, and slowly discover aliens are attacking. You never see them, but the actors know they are in danger. The strange ending made NO sense either to me to this day. I watched the film several times and still couldn't figure it out. But it is kind of like a really weird reality show horror film. People talk about what is going on, they explore outside too and try to escape, and just talk alot more. I kind of like it in a way. It held my interest. I liked the repeating strange public domain music too [like a soundtrack to a bad dream].  It is like no film I have ever seen. Sci- Fi MTV reality!  I don't think it is as bad as the other reviewers make it. You also see alot of early seventies fashions and haircuts too. Unique. I recommend it.",1311120000,3,982,4.056701030927835
7819349,1,6301963792,"Completely agree with the other reviewer. The only reason I own this is because the artwork made it look like some ridiculous horror movie and it was $1. I had no idea what I was in for. Read the other review and you will understand how awful this thing is. I hesitate to call it a movie because I could make a better, more entertaining film by walking around my neighborhood, strike that, let's go smaller, MY BLOCK with a camera. More would happen! I ended up fast forwarding through until the last two minutes.

Worst dialog ever. Worst lack-of-plot ever. Horrible acting. Awful camera work. Worst sound ever; move the boom closer! I can count on one hand how many things happened in this piece of trash. Stay away from the ominous red light and this VHS.",1282780800,,758,4.492753623188406
7819350,1,6301963792,"Without a doubt, one of the worst films I have ever seen. Every aspect of it is rotten: the cast, the acting, the music, the editing, the script...

It wants to be a sci-fi/horror movie, but fails miserably. The ""alien"" takes the form of a red flashlight beam. There are many intercuts of people in a city frantically running away from colored smoke that is pouring from containers on the ground; the shots are re-used several times, and are inserted seemingly at random.

The soundtrack is just a collection of library music. During one long scene, the music was too short, so it just stopped. Several seconds later, the snippet started again, played through, and then stopped. Seconds later, it was back...kind of like someone lifting the tone-arm from a vinyl record and replacing it at the beginning of a track.

The cast mainly sits around a cabin in the snowy woods and talks aimlessly about what has happened. No one knows. Except that, maybe, Earth and Mars were once very close together and the Martians escaped to Earth and went underground, only to reappear as red flashlight beams 2000 years later.

At the end, the last two survivors walk along snowy railroad tracks and then -- in the next shot -- become naked children skipping and frolicking through fields of flowers.

Then the credits roll.

And I am NOT making this up.",1200009600,5,1338,4.721030042918455
