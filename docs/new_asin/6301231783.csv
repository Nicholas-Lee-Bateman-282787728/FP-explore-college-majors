322876,2,6301231783,"Cary Grant and Constance Bennett go out for a drive when suddenly a tire blows out and they go off the side of the road.  When they come to, they both realize they individually have turned into a ghost.  They decide to cause all kinds of havoc with the people around them.  Billie Burke is in this film.  Two years later she played The Good Witch (the one who appeared in the big pink bubble) in The Wizard Of Oz (1939).  Hedda Hopper, who spoke of celebrity gossip on radio and newsreel, plays ""Mrs. Stuyvestant"".  Arthur Lake has funny scenes as a nervous Elevator Boy and then later as a Bellhop.  The next year, Arthur Lake became ""Dagwood Bumstead"" and played that character for the next 12 years in the ""Blondie"" film series from 1938-1950. This was the first film to be computer-colorized, a horrible technique that was used in the 1980's.  This was Not restoration.  The computer only had pale colors, such as, yellow, brown, green, pink, light blue, light green.  The computer would chase the colors onto an item or person.  This is why you see the flesh tone of someones face moving around. Which may not be the true flesh tone of the actor.  It is like putting tinted plastic wrap on the screen itself.  Computer-colorization did improved somewhat with other black & white films and some are quite watchable.  There is more interest and detail in watching a computer-colorized film that was originally black & white.  However, let me make something perfectly clear, When you see on VHS or DVD that a film has been RESTORED and DIGITALLY REMASTERED, that is a different process.  That means the actual negetive or master of the film has been carefully restored to its original deep, rich colors and  brightness. The film has been preserved for many more years. All scratches and pops are gone. But to get back to this version of TOPPER, this is only the computer-colorized version that I have written this review for.",1045785600,5,1927,4.670623145400594
322877,4,6301231783,"A delightfully zany excursion into screwball lunacy, this fantasy comedy was so popular, it was a hit T.V. series nearly 20 years later. Marion Kirby (the svelte and sophisticated Constance Bennett) and her husband George (debonair Cary)  playfully haunt Cosmo Topper a stuffy, dull and wealthy banker who's married to domineering yet fluttery wife (the effervescent Billie Burke). This was the original and best of the Topper series and it's a witty delight! This was Hal Roach's first venture into sophisticated comedy and it was a solid hit. Hoagy Carmichael couldn't claim that his OLD MAN MOON was sending Cary and Connie out of this world: they were already! Here, they play ghosts awaiting acceptance into the next world who had to perform a good deep; and decided it would be to teach henpecked Mr. Topper (Roland Young) how to live life to the full. Thorne Smith's fantastic novel was smartly adapted by Jack Jevne, Eddie Moran and Eric Hatch; Milton Bren produced for Roach. Norman Z. McLeod's bubbly direction was enhanced by Roy Seawright's photographic tricks, fading the star ghosts in and out. Fun!",958435200,7,1113,5.0162162162162165

322879,4,6301231783,"TOPPER the novel was published in 1926.  In 1937 the original TOPPER the movie was made, a combination of Cafe Society sophistication and invisible-man hijinks.  Cosmo Topper (Roland Young) is a staid officer at a bank.  Constance Bennett and Cary Grant are the high-living couple who die when they crash in their car, and Topper acquires the thing not knowing it's hauted.  These are not the kind of ghosts who like to frighten people; they need to do a good deed to reach the afterlife and so try to get Topper to live more fully (meaning, to them, more riotously).  With Billie Burke as Topper's henpecking wife, it won't be that easy a task.  Humorous movie with a bit of leftover ""Roaring Twenties"" in it (even the movie publicity defined the film as ""Roaring""), but perhaps we've seen too much of this sort of thing for it to seem quite novel.  Still, enjoyable.  Later became a TV show with different actors.",1508803200,5,915,4.6397515527950315

In fact he created a seperate division of the company to make  sure it is done  right.  You will enjoy this movie.,1327881600,2,259,4.02
322901,2,6301231783,"This product's editorial adequately covers the film's plotline.

Realized in 1983, and the very first of its kind, Hal Roach Studios colorized version of Topper is THE altered movie that gave colorization its well-earned (at the time) reputation for being a hackneyed process that detracted from, rather than added to a picture's watchability.

With a limited palette of broadly applied mostly pastel hues, no subtleties of tone, and facial tints that screamed ""Crayola,"" this is not the recommended starting point for anyone seeking superior colorization. For an outstanding example of the process, check out Disney's THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR (1961). You'll be amazed at how nice b&w movies can look with a bit of skillful computer tinkering.

322906,5,6301231783,"Having viewed the first volume of Topper, the television series, I looked forward to viewing volume two. This was a television series of which I am quite fond. It followed on the heels of the success of the Topper films that were made for the silver screen. The television series was also a hit and ran for several years during the nineteen fifties. I am not surprised at its success, given the quality of some of the writing. A number of the episodes were written by Stephen Sondheim, who later went on to greater fame and fortune. Mr. Sondheim's involvement in the television series was something of which I was previously unaware until I viewed the first volume of Topper, the television series.

While the television series is based upon the characters in Thorne Smith's best selling novel of the same names, it is not an actual adaptation of the book. Basically it takes the characters of the book and reformulates them to fit nineteen fifties sensibilities. In the series, Cosmo Topper (Leo G. Carroll) is vice-president of a bank. He is married to the sweet but dim Henrietta (Lee Patrick). They live in a house that they bought from the estate of an unfortunate young couple, George and Marion Kirby (Robert Sterling and Anne Jeffreys), who died in a skiing accident after being swept away by an avalanche. Their St. Bernard, Neil, who was unable to rescue them, also died with them. To Cosmo's surprise, his house is haunted by their ghosts and that of their alcohol imbibing St. Bernard. The problem is that only he can see or hear them. This allows for a lot of funny episodes, as the Kirbys tend to complicate Cosmo's life.

As does the first, this volume offers four episodes of the adventures of Topper. In one, the Kirbys believe that Cosmo is on a secret diplomatic mission, and they feel it is up to them to make sure nothing happens to him while he is on board a train. In the second episode, Cosmo's banking business takes him and Henrietta out West, but, unbeknownst to Cosmo, the Kirbys have meddled in his plans. In the third episode, the Kirbys play a trick on Cosmo, leading him to believe that he has won the Irish Sweepstakes and turning his world an its heels. In the fourth episode, Marion Kirby decides that she is no longer married to George. After all, marriage vows last until ""death do us part."" She reasons that since they are dead, they are no longer married, causing George to court her anew and inadvertently causing marital problems for Cosmo and Henrietta.

The role of Topper was perfectly cast, as Leo G. Carroll makes a delightful Topper. Lee Patrick is darling as his well-meaning, sweet and silly wife. Anne Jeffreys is terrific as the beautiful Marion Kirby, and Robert Sterling is great as her freewheeling husband. Of course, our cocktail loving St. Bernard is wonderfully portrayed by Buck. Kathleen Freeman is perfect as the Toppers' maid, Katie. All of them contributed to the success of this series. While some of the special effects of the series look hokey and amateurish in comparison to the special effects wizardry of today, for an early television series during the Golden Age of Television this was pretty heady stuff. I only wish that some television honcho would consider a remake of this wonderful television series.

In terms of the quality of the DVD, well, once again one gets what one pays for, as the quality of the DVD itself is simply dreadful. This DVD seems to have been made from an old, dirty print and not remastered or cleaned up in any way, shape, or form. At times, there is some very distracting background noise and some intermittent, although brief, issues with the audio. Moreover, the visuals are somewhat grainy, at best. Still, notwithstanding these issues, I would buy this DVD again in a heartbeat, simply because I love this series. While the quality of the DVD rates about a one, the substantive content of the DVD rates a high five.",1150934400,3,3920,4.701601164483261

Cary Grant and Constance Bennett are two recently deceased fun-loving, rich party-goers who come back to haunt the life of straight-laced banker Cosmo Topper (played by Roland Young). Bennett turns Topper's life so upside-down that he leaves his wife to have a good time with her. Of course it's all made right again before too much damage is done. The first 1/3 and the last 1/3 are the best parts; the middle part sort of drags. The picture is lots of fun. Worth a watch.",1112572800,2,605,4.654205607476635

7810638,5,6301231783,"Fans of the movie TOPPER can rejoice in the knowledge that they can now own the film in the best quality possible. VCI has just released the movie in blu-ray format and its about time. The film was a huge hit when released and a much needed boost in the careers of its stars, in particular Cary Grant who went on to mega hits in the screwball comedy genre.

The story revolves around Marion and George Kirby (Constance Bennett and Grant), a wealthy married couple who spend the nights drinking and carousing, a fun loving pair with little care in the world. When the movie opens they're on their way to an annual meeting overseen by their trusted caretaker Cosmo Topper (Roland Young), a banker who oversees their investments and takes care of things.

Cosmo is the complete opposite of the Kirbys. Hes more inclined to sit passively while life passes him by, more intent on pleasing his wife Clara (Billie Burke), a woman intent on making it in high society. But is he really content? On the outside Cosmo is the stuffy shirt that the Kirbys might tease but he has a boyish quality to him inside.

Things change when the Kirbys leave the meeting and Georges reckless driving lands them in a wreck killing the two of them. But fear not, that doesnt end to film. Its actually the beginning as both Marion and George become ghosts. Stuck in limbo since their lives led them to do neither good nor bad they realize that the only way to move on is to do a good deed. They decide that the best thing to do is rescue Cosmo from his boring life.

Soon they have Cosmo out on the town having the fun he always wanted. He buys their car and has it restored. All of this is to the consternation of his wife who feels he will end up disgracing the family name while she continues to pursue the upper crust crowd. Oddly enough she gets her wish not by her snooty attitudes but by Cosmos change of attitude.

Every step of Cosmos transformation finds him aided by the Kirbys. Sometimes seen and at others invisible they help him to discover that he may not need to go quite as far as they did with having fun but that he can enjoy life rather than be chained down by it.

The movie is a fun filled one that offers the cast the chance to do what they do best. Bennett was already a major star at the time the film was made and this one just advanced her career in that upward direction. As noted for Grant this was his first major comedic role and it suited his style perfectly. He went on to star in many more screwball comedies as well as dramas. For Young it was the biggest role of his career and one that earned him an Oscar nomination.

One wouldnt think that a movie focused around the death of a young couple would offer many laughs but the opposite is true. To this day the movie is a fan favorite for many and a perfect example of the screwball comedy genre. The story was popular enough to lead to two sequels as well as two TV series based on the story. Sadly many young people might not be familiar with the film but getting them to watch it should result in their discovering that movies were as good back then as they are today if not better.

Extras are nearly non-existent here with just the theatrical trailer available. But the real treat here isn't the extras but the movie itself. Its a fun filled romp thats sure to entertain even some 80 years later. Hard to believe its that old.",1512604800,,3389,4.317610062893082

7810640,5,6301231783,"Topper is one of my favorite movies.  When one considers when it was filmed, the special effects are amazing.  I compared this blu ray version to the 2003 Artisan standard DVD.  The blu ray has sharper background and more detail but the sound is similar and the imaging of the key figures is fine.  I am not convinced the blu ray adds that much compared to the earlier DVD but if you don't own this movie I would suggest getting the blu ray for the better image quality.  If you love his movie then definitely get the blu ray.  The blu ray gives a choice of black and white or colorized -- please, please watch it in black and white as the director intended it to be watched.",1511308800,,675,4.234375

What more could we ask.  Story is complete 30's fantasy, but it is so wonderful to go back to this innocent time.  No, this is not a movie that would appeal to millennials because it is so much a movie of its time.  For those who lived in the 30's, it is a pleasant return visit.
 I do hope Topper Returns gets the blu-ray treatment soon.  I almost loved this more than Topper.  However, Topper is a more authentic classic.  Topper Returns is a great and funny 40's murder mystery comedy classic, so typical of the time.
I am a Topper guy!  At 80 I really love returning to my youth.  Thanks for the ticket to the time machine!",1509667200,5,795,4.226666666666667
