This is a profound period in criminal justice and should not be forgotten as it will change criminal investigations forever.",1292112000,,302,4.716981132075472

This is a TRUE story of man who dreamed of being a police officer, which the film did not touch on.  When he failed the police exams, he became a firefighter, but his super-ego was such that he was never satisfied ""only"" fighting a fire.  When a job came available for an arson investigator, he applied, and thus began his career of starting sensational fires up and down the coast of California, resulting in the death of at least 7 people.

The film shows various fires attribututed to John Orr, his interactions in the fire department, and the task team that was formed to catch him.  It was scary to see how those who viewed this Man as a friend and asset had a difficult time believing he was guilty of these horrendous crimes.

There were only minor scenes of the two court cases, with the verdits shown on TV shows.  The amount of fires linked to him, and the extent of property damage, etc was never mentioned.

Although interestering enough, the book was so rich, and the film lacked the basic problem - that John could not deal with being rejected from the police force, then created an environment where he would be seen as the ""hero.""  I really didn't get the feel of ""being there"" that I would have liked to have in this kind of film.  Not a total disappointment, but not recommended if you've read the book.",1205625600,6,1472,4.4148148148148145
1877147,4,B000092T6E,"mesmerizing and great. I fell for this movie because the story was interesting, people, arsonists, setting fires and Liotta and Leguizamo have to find out who is doing this. from start to finish its grand and well directed. for fans of the 2 stars or who like fire movies. based on actual events",1066694400,,295,4.584905660377358
1877148,4,B000092T6E,"I knew absolutely nothing about this story before seeing the movie.  The film began and when it said that it was based off true events, I almost turned it off.  What caught my attention was the visual protrayer of the arson investigation... after that it was the story and the performances of the actors themselves.  Ray Liotta stars as arson investigator John Orr.  He, along with John Leguizamo, are trying to figure out who is starting all these arson-based fires.  John Orr is well regarded as the chief arson inspector and if anyone can find out, he can.  So the film plays out like a cat and mouse game.  You are trying to figure out what is motivating the person who is setting these fires.  What makes the story a bit more compelling is that, during the 90's, at least three firefighters were arrested for arson.  After watching the DVD, I found myself going over the film again.  I figured, since it was based on a true story the DVD would have some interesting extras.  I was disappointed, therefore could not give it a 5.  Nevertheless I did find the story fascinating.",1060473600,7,1080,4.567708333333333
