8702786,5,B00TQGGE4A,"Solty Rei starts out in a rather unassuming fashion. You think it's going to be about a gruff ex-cop, his adopted daughter, and the lovable eccentrics they meet along the way in a post-apocalyptic, Blade Runner-sequel cityscape. However, there is more to the story. WAY more. I'd say more, but that would give away too much.

The dub cast is uniformly excellent, but I really must single out Christopher Sabat's performance as Roy. I've enjoyed Sabat's work as comedic tough guys in other shows (Major Armstrong in FMA and Zoro in One Piece), but his work here is on a whole different level. His performance really anchors the show and carries it through both the lighthearted and serious moments. Credit must also go to Carrie Savage (Solty) and Colleen Clinkenbeard (Rose) for their work as the other two main characters.

All in all, a real gem of an anime that, like the characters it follows, deserves way more love than it's gotten.",1532822400,,938,4.783950617283951

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) Rei (pronounced Roy) Revant (voiced by Christopher Sabat) is a bounty hunter. 12 years ago a giant explosion called The Blast Fall destroyed a large portion of town with a lighting bolt. Leaving many dead, many wounded and some people missing. Rei was once a cop untill the blast fall that caused his daughter Rita to go missing. Refusing to believe she is dead after 12 years he continues to look. One day while chasing down a bounty he is ambushed by the one he is hunting, when he is about to get his a mysterious girl with green hair falls from the sky on the attacker and causes him to run away. Rei thanks the young girl and goes on his business. He knowtices the girl is following him around. Asking her whats her deal she tells him she has no memory of anything other than when she hit the attack after falling from the sky. After a few minor adventurs he adopts her as her naming her Solty Revant (voiced by Carrie Savage). Now they both go on bounty hunts as well as other adventures to find out who Solty really is and for Rei to find his daughter Rita.

Pros: the story really is top notch, its amazing and will keep you hooked on minuet one like it did me. This version really is 100% UNCUT and UNCENSORED so you will get all the blood, action and minor swearing (there really isn't much) that the show has to offer. The show really shows that no matter if you are family by blood or adoption you really are family. It is such a touching show.

Episode Pros: Even thow it says it comes with all 24 episodes, this also comes with a special double episode in 1 OVA.

Cons: The ending some people might not like the ending but I thought it was good.

Over all: I liked this series alot, BUY IT!!",1454803200,3,1864,4.299145299145299
