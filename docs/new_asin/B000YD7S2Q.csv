It is aptly interpreted, there are some great visual effects throughout using smoke, lighting and scenery.  It is still a traditional rendering, but with a little more emphasis on the mysterious qualities of the drama.

3027752,5,B000YD7S2Q,"This is truly a glorious version of Lohengrin with a splendid cast and truly unusual dramatic effect. So,are the acoustics fine. Indeed, the best version of Lohengrin that I have encountered.",1223337600,2,191,5.193548387096774
3027753,4,B000YD7S2Q,"I just purchased this, and though much has already said of the performers (particularly Schnaut, Studer, and Frey--all described accurately by other reviewers), I felt the need to review this positively to offset the reviewer who gave this production two stars because they disliked the ending.

""Regietheater"" (director's theater) in opera is nothing new. This production, for the most part, is traditional. Only the true purists would complain. Heck, the Bayreuth '82 DVD production doesn't even have a swan. The swan in this seems a little out of place, but ih. . .at least it's *there*. We live in a world where Valkyries ride invisible horses and Wagner's stage directions are only ""suggestions."" Feel grateful the chorus isn't dumping soup on the stage.

I love Cheryl Studer's Elsa (the highlight of this production) and Schnaut's Ortrud, though not the best I've heard, is very well acted. Frey as Lohengrin can't really. . .er, act. . .but his voice is all right, and Lohengrin only has a big part to play in Act 3, so for the first two acts he isn't as annoying as he could be. All in all, I'd recommend this far and above the Met version and *any* version with Placido Domingo in it. (I know his German has improved in recent years, but my God!) This isn't my favorite version--that goes to the '83 Bayreuth DVD--but is definitely worth adding to any Wagner collection.",1217548800,20,1380,4.794117647058823
3027754,2,B000YD7S2Q,"I had seen a scene from the second act on YouTube and was stunned at how beautiful and realistic the production was, so I purchased this dvd.  There were some amazingly beautiful touches in this production.  Sets, costumes, colors.  Also, some very fine performances by Studer and Schnaut most notably.

I was enjoying this UNTIL the very ending, which nearly, for me discredits the entire production.  The ending of Lohengrin is unique in that we have both overwhelming happiness and sadness.  When I say ""overwhelming"" - when done right, it is.  And as it IS so unique, the effect on the viewer is too.  Overwhelming happiness at the return of Elsa's brother and the triumph of ""good over evil"" - and overwhelming sadness as Elsa, upon discovering Lohengrin's departure, falling ""life-less.""  (One small mystery that I have debated is whether Elsa merely faints or dies.)  In any case, Ortrud is basically ""evil incarnate"" as she, with selfish and malicious motives is the cause of every problem in the story.  HOW COULD the director obscure the very essense of the story at the end of this production?  In this production after Lohengrin's departure, Elsa and Ortrud are seen ""reaching out"" to each other.  huh??  HUH????  I was VERY disappointed, after having enjoyed the performance up to this point to witness such strangeness.  The effect Wagner surely wanted is NOT here.

I would urge everyone who likes this opera to see the Met's production with Eva Marton and Peter Hoffman.  THERE IS NO COMPARISON.  I can tell you that you will be ""overwhelmed"" by how powerful the ending SHOULD be.  Directors who distort the stories of operas are MISREPRESENTING great art.  This is a RAMPANT problem in the world of opera.  While on the sympohony orchestra stage, intellects are striving for authenticity, in the world of opera, great artists are participating in FALSE representations of some of the greatest works of art ever.  One would not tolerate a mustache on the Mona Lisa.  Opera lovers should INSIST on authenticity and respect to at least the ESSENSE of the operas themselves.",1217548800,42,2087,4.931034482758621
3027755,3,B000YD7S2Q,"Werner Herzog's 1990 Bayreuth Lohengrin has some very good singing and occasionally interesting staging yet is seriously marred but dull direction and interaction among the characters. Of the four Lohengrin's I have seen on DVD (Abbado, Domingo/Vienna; Hofmann, Levine/Met; and Hofmann, Nelsson/Bayreuth), this overall has the least interesting characterisation and involvement from the singers.

The singing generally is fine. Paul Frey is a lyrical although unheroic Lohengrin, but this man can't act his way out of a box. He just looks stiff and unfomfortable. Cheryl Studer was well known for her Elsa, and offers much warmhearted lyricism. Try as she does, though, there is no chemistry between her and the dullard Frey. And she is simply not as moving as the Met's Eva Marton. Ekkehard Wlaschiha's Telramund and Gabrielle Schnaut's Ortrud are reasonably well done, but try as they may, they are somehow held back by well-known filmmaker Werner Herzog's inability to get his actors to well, interact much in a compelling manner.

Herzog's best moments come from his nature-inspired Act 2 dialogue between Elsa and Ortrud, more personal and compelling than most anything else in this quite static production. Herzog's emphasis on nature in Act 3 also is winning but when the actors and direction leave such an insipid impression on stage, the trees, the snow at the end - fine touches - go for little.

The Act 1 entrance of the swan is not compelling at all here. Almost embarrassing. And too often, the chorus, so vital in this work, while sounding great, looks small and insignificant through Brian Large's camera work.

Conductor Peter Schneider is one of the best parts of this performance, offering a straightforward reading with both lyricism and drama, rising to some compelling heights and passion when called for. Still, that and Studer's fine Elsa are not enough to bring this Lohengrin into the top rank.

Overall, the drama here is not compelling, not nearly as much as in the Levine/Met and Nelsson/Bayreuth productions, my favorites. Maybe one can chalk it up to Herzog's inexperience with the opera medium. For the most part this is just dull to watch.",1212105600,6,2172,5.107042253521127
3027756,5,B000YD7S2Q,"Wonderful news from the DGG vaults. Many of us Wagner lovers are familiar with this cherished production from previous incarnations.  But this reincarnation on DVD brings out everything to new life and new focus.  Outstanding interpretations from Cheryl Studer as Elsa and Gabriele Schnaut as Ortrud.  A little less so the Lohengrin of Paul Frey but we have heard much much worse in recent times.  Gorgeous, naturalistic production and staging.  No Regietheater or Eurotrash here.  It is like balm for the eyes, ears and soul. Again. All in all, this is THE Lohengrin to own. Thank you, DGG.  Question for DGG: how much longer before you release on DVD the treasured Bayreuth TANNHAEUSER with Maestro Sinopoli, Studer and others?",1210636800,19,729,5.07563025210084
3027757,5,B000YD7S2Q,"Wagner's 1850 vision of rapturous stillness, the ecstasy of love and of the strange and terrible beauty that is barely discernable in the eternal silence that rounds our lives, has often been one of the most difficult of his operas to stage. Rudolph Kempe's brilliant 1964 recording on EMI is still the finest recorded version available of this deeply mystical work. Wagner perfected the technique of sonically weaving a cosmic stage upon which human passions play out in his later masterpieces, especially Tristan and Parsifal, but Lohengrin is the headwater of much of his greatest later artistry.

Film director Werner Herzog staged this production under the watchful eye of Bayreuther Festspiele artistic director (and Wagner grandson), Wolfgang Wagner. Herzog was given his marching orders: this production must stay in the repertoire a minimum of five years - ""so no trendy antics."" By blending the most modern and up-to-date theater technology: smoke, lasers, film back projection, with a deeply traditional stage production, Herzog has essentially created a late 20th century version of a 19th century picture-book world that romantically recreates the primitive 10th century northern-European setting. Nothing exemplifies this more than Lohengrin's sudden, heroic swan-borne entrance through a scrim of laser light and smoke. The effect is electrifying as it is perfectly timed to Wagner's powerful music. Moments such as these work brilliantly in combination with the magnificent sound and exemplary performance of the Bayreuther Festspiele. This time travel telescoping of three temporal sensibilities, crisply focuses (into a slightly more Earthbound vision) Wagner's occasional over-reaching for mythic effects, the very thing that makes his operas so difficult to stage coherently. That is one of this production's greatest strengths, and is well worth a recommendation for that fact alone.

The cast stars Paul Frey as Lohengrin, Manfred Schenk as King Henry the Fowler, and Cheryl Studer as Elsa von Brabant. The orchestra is conducted by Peter Schneider. Their performances are superb, heightened by Bayreuth's absolutely resplendant acoustics. Every note bursts from the stage with a warmth and clarity fostered by the now 150 year old wood from which the stage is constructed. The orchestra, which plays from beneath the covered pit, is similarly rewarded: Wagner's brilliant writing for the brasses is given a warmth and reverberant fullness of tone that is slightly recessed and softened by the wood covering. Unique in the opera world, Bayreuth's stunning acoustics provides an aura of distance, increasing the other-worldly quality of Wagner's music, an effect that is perfect for his operas.

Brilliantly directed by Brian Large, the DVD was filmed in June 1990 and looks crystal clear in this remastered version that runs for 214 minutes. The sound in both PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 is full, rich and life-like. There are the usual DGG menus and translations. A booklet is enclosed.

A blend of traditional staging with new technology, all in the service of a splendid artistic conception, makes this Lohengrin a fine investment for fans of this opera. Most strongly recommended.

The Prelude is a thing apart: one of the most spiritual works I know, and it is a sign of Wagner's genius and self-renewal that the Parsifal Prelude is so different but equally spiritual. Paul Frey is an excellent Lohengrin, more savior than warrior, but his sweet tenor voice captures the blessedness of one who lives in the Grail's presence. The love he conveys is not so much erotic as agape love and that, I believe, is a valid interpretation. I find Cheryl Struder's voice radiant, persuasive and ccompletely expressive of a naive but loving princess. However, what makes this such a satisfying production is Werner Herzog's staging: this innovative director of remarkable films buried his ego and created a Romantic Vision of the medieval period.

8232349,3,B000YD7S2Q,"Lohengrin was an early Wagner opera based on early medieval sources. Pagan gods and black magic are pitted against the New Testament God and Christian magic, and the latter win out, thanks mainly to the fighting prowess of a mysterious swan knight, but not before a witch named Ortrud goads Elsa, the knight's innocent bride, into asking him who he is. That is all it takes for the knight to renounce his bride and the Brabantians (whose protector he has agreed to be), to reveal his origins, and to take the first swan boat back to Christendom.

It is a slow-moving piece of music theater. I suspect the opera might have dragged even in 1850, when it premiered. I had hoped that the Bayreuth staging here by Werner Herzog, the film director of Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre: The Wrath of God, would provide some needed heft and action for non-German viewers. Alas, no. Perhaps Herzog was constrained by the requirements of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus or the wishes of the producer, Wagner's grandson and the keeper of the family flame, but in any event the actors in this production pose and change their positions very very slowly and the chorus rises and shines and moves about like the climax of a Bruckner symphony sounds. It is all very traditional.

The videography does not help. There are numerous long shots, held forever, of the moon over waves, some painted and some manufactured by a wave machine, rocks, and a semi-finished medieval castle. There is not a single shot of the famous theater, the supposedly live audience, the orchestra, the conductor, or even a rising curtain. On the other hand, the music, though it appears dubbed, is performed well enough. Lohengrin is sung by lyric heldentenor Paul Frey, who had a short career at the top but looks the part. Cheryl Studer sings very well as Elsa. The other principals do their jobs. Costumes and sets are unexceptional.",1268611200,4,1882,4.805555555555555
8232350,5,B000YD7S2Q,"I have found very few Wagner recordings in any format that compare with this Lohengrin.  If we just want the sound, there is the live 1966 Tristan with Boehm, Nilsson and Windgassen. Gotterdammerung with Solti, Nilsson and Windgassen is another top pick. Leinsdorf's  Walkure, remastered on CD, Is still great.  Wagner without Flagstad, Nilsson or Windgassen is not the same, the singers who came after them rarely sing with the same power and security.  On the other hand modern acting in opera is better, except when there is needless added action.

That said, I feel modern singers deserve a break, due to an increase of noise in the world.  In 1960 powerful stereos, leaf blowers, hair dryers, microwave ovens, airconditioners, and lawn tractors were rare.  Refrigerators only had one motor running part time, of course defrost was manual.  I could go on.  The exposure to all this noise diminishes our perception of and ability to hear soft music.  Hearing tests only go up to 6000 or 8000 Hertz so much of the ear damage inflicted is not documented.  I am in the early stages of trying to document our decline in hearing.  To take a long view, noise has been increasing for 300 years, IMO.  Singers could sing with many more vocal colors in the past than they can now, simply by being able to sing softer.

As a listener ages, hearing declines due to noise and other health factors,  It is no wonder that we think so highly of the singers of our past.  We heard them with young ears in a less noisy world.

BACK TO THE REVIEW

Studer as Elsa is stunning.  She is secure in technique and on pitch.  Her ability to register the emotions of Elsa puts her ahead of prior singers.  Frey as Lohengrin is a bit stiff and light voiced, but this is only a small negative.  Tenor voices are the weak link when it comes to power singing.  All the remaining men are superb.  Schneider conducts so well that I am tempted to put him above Furtwaengler, and certainly above Solti by a mile.  The chorus is stunning, particularly the men.

Schnaut as Ortrud is where people will divide.  She is mean enough, making for a great contrast with Studer's gentle Elsa.  Unfortunately she goes off pitch.  I gave two of these DVDs to friends and got one strong vote for Schnaut and one strong vote against.  Before they cast their votes I had felt conflicted, and still do.  If you like Klose as Fricka in both the Furtwaenger and Bruno Seidler- Winkler Walkures you might like Schnaut.  If you like Flagstad's  Rheingold Fricka, you probably will hate her.

The staging is magical and fits the mystical setting of the opera.  I don't think Lohengrin can be updated sucessfully, it is fixed in the King Arthur days.  The lighting is superb and tracks the mood of the music perfectly.  This is a great escape back to the year 1000. The sound is excellent in LPCM mode, barring  slight occasional compression.  Bare in mind that this was recorded live in 1990 so the 5.1 is synthetic.  Dynamic range is very wide, so only superb speakers and phones will reveal all the power and detail in the sound.  Don't let the age of this recording concern you.  In my opinion, Bayreuth was ahead in getting the sound right.",1260316800,11,3193,4.588652482269503
8232351,5,B000YD7S2Q,"I have seen 3 DVD productions of Lohengrin -- this one, the MET version with Hoffman/Marton, and the Vienna version with Domingo/Studer.  As is often the case, none is ""ideal"" but I rate this version significantly above the other two.  It doesn't have the strongest Lohengrin but Frey is certainly more than adequate.  His youthful appearance is a definite asset and if he is a little ""wooden"", that fits with the otherworldliness of the character.  (Domingo, by contrast, is more Melchior-like -- large voice and girth, great for a CD, not so credible for a DVD with many EXTREME CLOSEUPS.) Studer looks and sings well; her costumes (like those of others in this production) are of the generic flowing robes variety -- but they are colorful and can be viewed as both traditional and timeless.  (Again, for comparison, the costumes of the Vienna production are probably more accurate for 10th century Europe but are dismal in appearance; coupled with the low lighting and the claustrophobic stage and you have an ugly production.)  Ortrud (Schnaut) is a standout (certainly not a lovely voice, but a powerful one well suited for the character; also a good actress). But the overwhelming impression is that of viewing a fairy tale courtesy of the scenery, lighting, and stage movement that Herzog brings to the production.  Scenes appear to leap from a children's story book or, perhaps, a medieval book of hours.  There are changes of weather (snow), changes of light from night to day, rippling water, and so forth.  But the production is not literal like the MET and Vienna Lohengrins.  There is a smoke and laser show accompanying Lohengrin's entrance and exit (but it is in keeping with the fairy tale atmosphere).  For me, this production reflects the essence of Lohengrin -- a mythological tale that is enhanced by the lighting, colors, and careful arrangement of the singers in living tableaux.",1241395200,23,1901,4.965299684542587
8232352,4,B000YD7S2Q,"The three remarkable performances here are by Ekkehard Wlaschiha (who really brings Telramund to life, even makes you feel sorry for the stupid rock-head; also he displays flawless high-register technique and comfortable mastery of one of the most difficult roles in opera), Gabrielle Schnaut (her Ortrud is fearsome, especially when she challenges Elsa at the end of Act II, watching this is like being attacked by a moulting ostrich) and beautiful Eike-Wilm Schulte, relaxed but not soft or whiney as the Herrufer; whose personality he makes enthusiastic but dignified and modest, like a perfect broadcast reporter.  Also the choruses are fantastic.

The other singers are adequate (although Paul Frey and Manfred Schenk are both way too boring), and the staging and costumes are terrific, with just the right balance of tradition and fantasy.  I especially enjoy the slow-mo sword fight in Act I.  And having Ortrud run into the river and turn her back to the audience for her prayer to the displaced gods in Act II is a nice touch.",1227139200,4,1035,5.035087719298246
