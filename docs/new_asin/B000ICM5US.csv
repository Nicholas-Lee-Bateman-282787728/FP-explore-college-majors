2655189,5,B000ICM5US,"The only thing I think is lacking on Amazon's reviews is that they're not making it clear enough that with this set you're getting yourself all the ThunderCats material out there. Season 1 (the original season from where the Cats landed on 3rd Earth (the famous 'Exodus' episode) right to the last on 3rd Earth in which their greatest enemy Mumm-Ra not only has to face the Cats but is threatened by the ancient Spirits of Evil themselves!

And next you have the 2nd season which played on New Thundera. The Cats have returned to their original, yet new, home with new friends (The 'new' ThunderCats) and new Cat treasure like the Book of Omens and such. And this is also where the series eventually came to a stop. I can't comment on the exact details since I haven't seen all of those episodes yet myself. But that will soon change now that I ordered this set :-)

Some people complained about this release not being remastered, re-dubbed, etc. and quite frankly I consider this to be a big pro instead of a con. In my opinion nothing can beat the original. When companies start re-doing stuff you'll always be left with something missing or ""not entirely right"". Simply because you may have remembered (or lived) it completely different. So my advice would honostly be: ""Now is your chance to grab the entire original series at a very decent price, go for it while you can!"".

2655212,3,B000ICM5US,"I've only watched the first disc of the first season so far, and it's just as wonderfully hokey as I remember. The fabulous 1980s cartoon dialogue is just as it should be (completely overacted), and the background music is trying SO hard! All in all, it's exactly the trip down memory lane I wanted.

So why only three stars? Part of the experience of buying a TV series on DVD is the physical discs themselves - the artwork on the discs, the packaging, and so forth. I was very disappointed to learn when I received my order that all the packaging was in SPANISH. The seller had enclosed a note stating that I should not worry, because all the CONTENT was in English, and this is true, but still, the product page never mentions this. I would not have ordered this particular collection if I had known in advance. It seems to me that this is the sort of thing that purchasers should be made aware of beforehand - after all, anyone can buy episodes of a show, or even the entire show, in a digital format these days, it should be a safe assumption that anyone choosing to buy that show in a physical form probably cares about the ""ancillary stuff"" like packaging too.",1456012800,11,1167,4.427906976744186

2655229,2,B000ICM5US,"I want to be very clear about this review. I will always give the Thundercats cartoon series 5 Stars. It's a wonderful show that I loved at a kid and still enjoy today.

However I can not give this DVD box set five stars. This series would benefit from being remastered. This set came to me new, at least it looked new. It was still in the shrink wrap. The packing and words on the boxes are all in Spanish. It's weird, but doesn't effect my review either way. It probably should be mentioned on the Amazon product page though.

I give this DVD box set only two stars because the teeth that hold the DVD's in place are broken, The DVD's may have been dropped or abused because they are scratched. The first episode was flickering the way an old film projector movie flickers. The Sound quality is terrible. The ending song in Episode two sounded like an old tape player low on batteries. I have only owned this set for twelve hours  and am deeply disappointed. I'm considering returning for a replacement. I'll see how the other episodes look. If they are all messed up I'll need to ship it back for a new one. I only hope they aren't all this bad.",1446508800,6,1148,4.330232558139535

2655235,5,B000ICM5US,"I  remember  this  show  from  the  late  1980's.  I  use  to  watch  it  every  chance  I  got.  It  was  one  of  my  favorite  shows  truly.
I  think  they're  weird  adventures  are  cool!  I  liked  the  mutants  better  than  most  of  the  bad  guys  in  the  show. Mumra  is  about  the  only  one  who  can  temporarily  have  an  advantage  of  the  Thunder cats.  Slithe Jackleman Monkian  &  Vultureman  forget  it,  once  in  a  while  they  can  come  up  with  a  plan  to  have  Lionel  at  his  mercy  or  the  other  thunder cats.  Most  of  the  time  the  mutants  take  off  running  when  they  can't  outclass  them!  They're  funny.
Then  in  Volume  1 & 2  from  season  2  we  see  some  new  enemies  instead  of  the  mutants  there  are  new  ones  known  as  the  lunatocks.  &  I  think  Frankenstein  &  Count Dracula  would  love  those  guys.  They're  nothing  more  than  a  group  of  silly  &  stupid  characters.  I  didn't  like  them  as  much.  Season  2  both  volumes  my  opinion  is  (I  do  not  think  they're  near  as  popular  as  Season  1  &  both  volumes.
What  happens  to  the  mutants  in  season  2  is  they're  taken  prisoner  by  someone  with  a  circus  train,  some  goofy  looking  guy.  &  its  just  not  the  same  without  them!
Skip  season  2  if  you  choose  to.  But  definitely  check  out  season  1!
Thunder cats  is  a  great  show!  But  I  cannot  promise  you  that  you'll  enjoy  the  entire  series.",1425600000,,1485,4.202479338842975

2655275,3,B000ICM5US,"A great collection of episodes (it competes only with its older cousin, MOTU, for its historic staying power of two full seasons [130 episodes]). While this was a great series, it was not without its faults (particularly, throughout the last half of the second season). Still, here it is for all of us to enjoy!

Audio: The audio seems to translate very well to DVD on most episodes. In some instances, however, the background music is completely LOST throughout the entire episode (""Unholy Alliance"" springs immediately to mind). With the audio of many episodes translating so well, it does nothing for the Warners' credibiity that the attention to details of other episodes is so lax that they are completely missing the background music!

Video: There have been some complaints that the video on some of the episodes was not cleaned up since their original airings. Whether or not this is true, it serves two purposes. For one, to have not cleaned up the footage only restores the retro feel of watching these classics on television in our youth. For another, if the video footage was not fully restored, it does give fans ample excuse to complain about aging, dirt, or scratches on the master film (though, this is not nearly as notable as some of the older cartoons from the sixties). In the case of these discs, I personally haven't noticed any problems with aging.

Special Features: Mostly interviews from the artists.

Episodes: I've touched on this above just a bit but there are a lot of complaints about some of Season 2's episodes being a tad bit lame at times and resorting to old storylines/footage. However, this of course is not the fault of the DVDs if the episodes themselves were poorly written. A fair advanced warning: I hate to belaver the obvious but we watched this when we were younger and not every show translates well as viewers grow older. For me: it's still a great show and the one problem that I took with the discs is that I really thought that the five-part ""Lion-O's Annointment Trial"" should have been packaged together back-to-back (of course, not everyone would agree with me, as this would have placed the episodes at the disadvantage of being out of the order in which they originally aired. You be the judge).

Packaging: I was a bit suprised by the packaging. I like the concept art on each DVD case (the outer layer and each individual case) and I particularly like the outside of Season 2 with its ""metamorphic"" image outside of the case. However, I have been spoiled by BTC/BCI's treatment of the Filmation library, and almost expected each volume to have a comprehensive episode guide to tell us what was on each disc of each volume (something that backs of the cases already did) and with a brief summary of each episode.

Overall: a fair attempt by Warner Home Video to release this gem from Lorimar/Rankin-Bass for old fans and a new generation to enjoy. ""THUNDER CATS, HO!""",1277078400,8,2924,4.757396449704142

2655278,4,B000ICM5US,"I couldn't wait for the price to be reduced for this collection, I just bought it. I find this remastered version of the Thundercats very faithful to the 80s version and cannot complain about the quality of image or sound.

My being a student of Comparative Literature, and studying the network of media/knowledge/power, I couldn't help but notice how the cartoon reflected many of the aspects of the American political culture through cartoons aimed at younger viewers. ""Third Earth""? hello? couldn't they be alittle subtle about the message their trying to convey? It is just so blunt.

Nevertheless, the cartoon cannot be discredited just because it reflected (consciously or unconsciously, implicitly or explicitly) the age's political tendencies towards the ""other"". I Do not claim to know much about the history of cartoons or Anime, but I have noticed that this may well be the first intermarriage between the American cartoon (best seen in He-Man) and Japanese Anime. The fact that Thundercats is a coproduction between American and Japanese artists is often forgotten. One could easily detect strong traces of Japanese Anime mixing with American cartoon.

I appreciate this collection very much and would have rated it with 5 stars had it avoided the following:

1. The makers of this collection managed to make English captions for all the episodes in this series; except for Season 2, Vol. 2, in which it was given up for some sort of game to be played as part of the extra features.

2. The Extra features are very disappointing in that they do not show you except very little insight into the history of the Thundercats. Thundercats through the extra-features seems as if it had been enjoyed by only a few kids and some nerds. (With all due respect to all Nerds out there).

3. The packages are too big. One volume contains 6 DVDs in traditional old DVD cases; this could have been avoided by smart designs of compact packaging like the one found in the X-files collection (the UK/Region 2 version) in which 7 DVDs was packed in a small DVD case half the size of this one.

Nonetheless this is a collection you cannot not buy! It would be enjoyable. I certainly did enjoy it.. I watched it all over a period of one month.

One last WARNING:
If you watched this as a kid, you may find it extremely stupid. Some of the episodes are so lame, you could just predict that they took some voice recordings of older episodes and just stuck them together and passed them to you as an action-packed episode, when it is so bad of a story.. or non-story. You will find this very evident in the second season where they are desperate to put ideas together; Lion-O is always saved so easily that there is no fun for those of us cheering for Mumm-Ra. Deus ex machina is used at the beginning.. but it is later over-used and abused.

So do not expect to be thrilled the same way you were when you were a kid. You certainly are not going to cheer for Lion-O now... but for the unconventional Mumm-Ra.",1230940800,5,2996,4.669829222011385

8145035,2,B000ICM5US,"Sorry, but this series of DVDs is mislabeled.  As you can see from other customers, the disks are Region 2 and the artwork isn't
the actual artwork from the series on the box; but some reproduction by another artist of the characters in the series.  Everything on the artwork and product packaging is in Spanish and NOT ENGLISH.  There was an enclosed note saying that the series would be play in English; but I feel that this is dishonest of the seller to list that this is an English product and it's clearly a foreign-made distribution and obviously bootleg production which was shrink-wrapped in a flimsy, cardboard case which had already shown signs of the artwork flaking when I received it yesterday.  I returned it.",1502323200,4,723,4.76
