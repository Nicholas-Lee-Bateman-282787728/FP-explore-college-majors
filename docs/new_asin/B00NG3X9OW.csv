6648777,5,B00NG3X9OW,"Mercy starring Chandler Riggs (The Walking Dead) as George, the youngest of two brothers that have to take care of their sick grandmother.  Supernatural Teen scream.

Well I did not scream but it was very eerie and gave me goosebumps and the tiny hairs on the back of my neck stood up a couple of times. This is not a horror or gore film, but it is scary almost throughout the whole movie. Even in the non scary parts it is scary.

This is one of the best film adaptations of a Stephen King book I have seen and it was worth watching it.

Joel Courtney did an excellent job as the older brother. The acting was very good by a great cast, the directing was spot on, the editing was a dream and the photography was scary.

I rate this 4 out of 5 stars. I will not add it to my movie collection, because once I saw this I do not want to see it again. Add it to yours though, especially if you are a teenager so you can have years of goosebumps. Oct 2014

The film moves to the present and we quickly know what happened in the opening scene. Grandma Mercy (Shirley Knight) has taken a shine to her grandson George (Chandler Riggs). We discover grandma had triplets and is somehow connected to old world paganism while something supernatural is going on. We get sparse hints until about 40 minutes into the film when we get the long version of the tale.

Grandma is suffering from Alzheimer, although she responds best to George who has an invisible friend...and how long was that drawn circle in the basement there before anyone noticed...and were the candles always lit? We do get to see the whatever late in the film and I thought the over priced black velvet painting was better.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.  On a side note, there were no opening FBI copyright warnings. The film starts off playing on its own like a cheap pirate DVD.",1447718400,2,988,4.69364161849711

6648797,3,B00NG3X9OW,"Based on Stephen King's short story 'Gramma' and greatly influenced by the great HP Lovecraft, Mercy is the tale of a woman who gives up her soul to get her heart's desire.

'Mercy' is a melding of King and Lovecraft that, for the most part, delivers on all accounts. It's got several well done spook moments and demonic undertones that really develops as the main character, 11-year-old George, attempts to understand what is going on with his beloved grandmother who's suffered a stroke. He--along with his brother and mother--go to take care of her and as odd happenings begin to occur, and his grandmother's strange and frightening behaviors, it's up to George to unravel the pieces and not die in the process.

Shirley Knight is phenomenal as Mercy, who must convey everything by saying very little. She really makes the movie and without her superb acting, this would have been a bland addition to the horror genre. None of the other characters, from Chandler Riggs (Walking Dead), Frances O'Conner (Mansfield Park, AI) to Dylan McDermott add much nuance or substance to the story.

The directing, production, music and cinematography are all fine but the script and way the story unfolds got a bit tedious and so for the first half of the film, it lags quite a bit with a lot of clues but none truly developing--or making much sense--until you get to the end. That's fine, to a degree, but my attention waned for a great deal of the movie. It's a complete story, beginning to end, and nothing is left hanging in the wind. It's a predictable story but interesting enough in execution though by no means mind-blowing or exciting. It might be worth another watch. Maybe.",1433635200,2,1674,4.7854671280276815
6648798,2,B00NG3X9OW,"I guess it was only a matter of time until someone put little Carl (Chandler Riggs) from the Walking Dead in a movie. Mercy is that film, and it is based on a short story by Stephen King. There is a reason this was a short story, there wasn't enough to make an entire book out of it, so what made them thing there was enough for a full length film? Rebecca, George, & Buddy are going to spend time living with their grandmother at her cabin in the woods. She is a sick old woman and it's only a matter of time, but she isn't a candidate for the nursing home, because she is psychotic. While caring for the old woman, George (Riggs) finds some mysterious occult stuff, that lead him to believe his grandmother isn't psychotic, but possessed. This film is everything that is wrong with the Horror movies of today, because it's not scary, different, or even all that interesting, it's more stupid than anything else. For most of the movie, nothing happens, except for this kid walking around testing his theory, but what does it matter, the old woman is going to be dead soon anyway right? Chandler Riggs stars and I really don't care for him as an actor. I realize he's just a kid, but Riggs is always playing some whiny loner, looking for help. Some people might find it cute or endearing, to me it's just annoying, especially in a film where he's the lead. The rest of the cast was underutilized, especially Super 8's, Joel Courtney, who is a terrific young talent, I would have liked to see more of. Mercy is written by the master of horror and stars two of TV's top young stars, but it was a story that never developed into anything, and is buried in some massive Stephen King short story anthology. This is not the kind of story that should have ever been turned into a film. I don't say it much, but this time I really believe that Mercy was just a waste of 90 minutes that I will never get back.",1431820800,,1900,4.324929971988795

6648805,2,B00NG3X9OW,"Mercy was a movie that's worth watching if you're looking for a movie or horror movie to watch. It's good enough to keep you hooked until the end but it's not good enough to watch more than once. Once it reaches the end, the movie starts falling off. By then it only has 10-15 minutes left & you're probably thinking I made it this far so why not finish it (That's what I mean when I say it's good enough to keep you hooked until the end) It's an OK movie with not much going on so there's not much to write about.

However, noticed like a less than a month later this film was already available to see thru NETFLIX, so I took the opportunity to look into it. Main reason I even considered it either buying it or watching it, was because the main actor in the movie, the kid that play Carl in the ""Walking Dead"" series (Chandler Riggs) was in it and I believe is the first film he's ever made, so I was curious. Sorry to say, I was disappointed myself. DO NOT recommend to anyone. I stopped watching it not even 20 minutes into it.

6648813,5,B00NG3X9OW,"One of my favorite horror stories Gramma by Stephen King. They made it into a masterpiece of a movie, but I highly doubt it's nuance is appreciated by the general public. I would not be surprised if most were confused by it. As JRR Tolkein created a Fantasy History and Pantheon, so did HP Lovecraft create a Horror mythos with as much depth. Mercy, the name of the resulting movie from the short story Gramma is steeped in Lovecraft. In an act of desire for family barren young Mercy having found one of the Necronomicon Tombs uses it to give birth. Sadly there are negative consequences, the apparent suicide of her husband. And over the years Mercy uses some of the dark secrets to obtain her desires. But the oncoming payback appears to be the possession of her grandson by one of the elder beings Hastur, by which means the gates could be reopened to the dark beings that ruled the earth before man. The pieces of the story weave together through what initially appears to be the story of family drama, caring for a beloved geriatric family member. But slowly, the Lovecraftian mythos bleed through. I am not sure if it was understandable to someone not familiar with such. But for me it was the best horror in some time, not just based on shock value and cheap thrills, but looking right at our desire and the consequences of that desire. And in the end despite having risked hell on earth, something good came into the world, family. Then again, family can be hell on earth too...LOL!",1420243200,11,1491,4.567164179104478

6648815,5,B00NG3X9OW,"Good adaptation of Stephen King's story. Good character development, acting, and suspense. It's more along the lines of the movie adaptation of King's Misery or Dolores Claiborne rather than The Shining.",1419897600,2,203,5.580645161290323
6648816,2,B00NG3X9OW,"The story starts off with a flashback of a significant event that will come to light at the end of the film. Then it settles into the plot where George and his brother are forced to join their mother in caring for their grandmother. Things turn awry about 8 minutes in when she begins to suffer some mental defects. George has always been close to her, so he is hit the hardest by this. While his family is trying to cope and deal with their new dilemma, Georges struggle to keep life for his grandmother as easy as possible is proving to be a futile effort as her condition worsens. Her condition is not naturally occurring though, despite her old age. There is some supernatural stuff going on, with the grandmother speaking in demonic tones at times, and it is obvious that a supernatural force is passing information to George for reasons yet to be known. It takes a really long time for the horror to develop, aside from his grandmother being in a terrible mental and physical state. When the horror finally does manifest itself it is not very good. We see a little demon action but it never hits hard. The horror felt cheap, generic, and was never the least bit scary. With such subtle horror you would hope that the rest of the story made up for it (although a horror film with cheap horror is doomed to fail), but that was not the case. I did not like that the storys locations were timid and sub-par, with most of the film taking place within basic indoor settings. While not a requirement, a poorly executed story benefits from movement, but that simply did not happen. They never leave into the woods or anywhere else, there is no chase and the horror stays concentrated in one area. The horror is not the only sub-par element of the story  the characters were poorly written as well. Not once did I care for George and the struggle he faced trying to make the best of his grandmothers dire situation, and poor writing execution is to blame for that. I also mentioned that Dylan McDermott has a supporting role in the film, but his role was hardly support  it was a waste of a character who did little to move the story.

The direction from Peter Cornwell was OK, but it did not save the effort. Cornwell provided decent atmosphere during the indoor scenes, which were gloomy and appropriate for such a gritty supernatural tale. He gets decent performances from his actors, with Sherley Knight stealing the show as Mercy. Her character was put through a lot emotionally, mentally, and physically, and Knight handled the roller coaster well. Chandler Riggs was basic and nowhere near as good as he is on The Walking Dead, while Dylan McDermott wasDylan McDermott. The execution of the horror was where the direction ultimately failed, giving us few scares and some crappy CGI during a wasted third act.

Overall, Mercy is a mediocre experience that I would not recommend to anyone. If you are curious to see Chandler Riggs and Dylan McDermott in a film then I understand that, but keep in mind that they will be poorly used.",1419811200,4,3034,4.58195211786372

It needed more details, so I might just read the story Stephen King wrote and see if that offers some more clues.

Pros: It was an interesting story (what was shown) and it draws you in, wanting to know more and hoping things turn out well. There were some spooky and startling moments that kept things interesting.

6648828,3,B00NG3X9OW,"I thought this movie was confusing and unbelievable because there didn't seem to be any adequate explanation for the characters to act the way they did, especially the grandmother. And about the lighting in the creepy 150 year old house. Every lamp must have had a 5 watt light bulb because the only illumination from the lamps stopped about 1 foot away and dissolved into pitch black darkness. And yet, from the house's exterior the shots showed the interior of the house ablaze with light. Stupid.

This movie could have been pretty good but it just didn't make much sense to me. To explain my rating, I didn't dislike the film enough to really bad mouth it but I won't be watching it again and I wouldn't recommend it.

Mercy (played by Shirley Knight) is the title character in the movie.  She is apparently a grandmother with SEVERE mood swings, although (at least to me) for reasons you can't explain why.  She seems (at times) to be attached to her youngest grandson, George (pronounced with an ""ie"" on the end); at other times, it seems she wants to kill him. I won't go into much more because I won't spoil anything for anyone else who may want to view this.  It is based on a short story by Stephen King.  I think the film might have made a tad more sense (not to mention less jumbled) had King been allowed to also write the screenplay.  Unfortunately, that was done by Matt Greenberg.  I don't really know what Greenberg was trying to do, but all he managed to do was throw together ""something"" that just did not translate to the screen.

The acting was another aspect of the film I thought was pretty bad.  The lead character (Georgie) was played by Chandler Riggs.  I don't want to discourage Mr. Riggs from future endeavors, but I think he needs some acting classes.  He simply did not have the ""chops"" to pull off his role.  Dylan McDermott also appeared, but I have no idea why.  His character served no purpose, as far as I could tell.  Shirley Knight (as mentioned before) played the lead character, Mercy.  Her effort was there, but I really do not think she knew exactly who her character was.  Piper Laurie would have made for a much better Mercy.  Other characters are quickly introduced, but are never truly defined.

The overall feel and look of the movie was kinda' creepy, and that's one of the few plusses about this movie.  The run time is extremely short (only 79 minutes), and the viewer can tell the people involved seemed to be in a hurry to complete this movie.  It shows.  The version I saw was rated R for language and violence.  It is not recommended.",1413849600,6,2059,4.432

Don't ask alot of questions and enjoy the horror.  There is no menu, it starts N ends to start again.  Good horror, made on the cheap(no menu, or special features)Stephen King feel but those *unfamiliar with story might be lost, however it delivers some jolts.
