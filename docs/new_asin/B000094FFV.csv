There really isn't many good things about this film, but it does seem to be either an homage to the Halloween franchise, or just a blantant rip-off.

[the bad]

It is very low budget, and it shows.

The acting is bad, and the plot sucks-- well, it doesn't suck but it is not unique.

The score is almost identical to the score of Halloween.

Johnny is almost a carbon copy of how Jason Voorhees would be if he morphed with Michael Myers.

The kills are nullified, and crappy.

The Elmsdale police make the police of Haddonfield and Crystal Lake look like geniuses.

[final thoughts]

The movie just seems to be a very bad rip-off of Halloween, nothing more, nothing less. The killer is very Michael-esque, but poor at it.

The P.O.V.'s shot were very Halloween, and all the way down to the score.

The make-up effects also sucked ass.

Don't watch this movie unless you have nothing else to do or really like crappy slasher flicks (as I do).",1136246400,3,956,4.52046783625731
1879011,3,B000094FFV,"Here's an original story: A young boy is abused by his mother, a trashy, boozy, foul-mouthed, chain-smoking harridan.  The boy endures her daily insults in silence.  He never talks.  Not to anyone.  Not since dad ""disappeared"" (rumors vary).  But at least Quiet Boy has a hobby -- he tortures small animals.

The neighborhood kids think Quiet Boy is retarded, and so they relate to him in the time-honored tradition of how children deal with the mentally handicapped: they tease him.  They play pranks on him.  And then ... one of those pranks ""goes wrong.""

Flashforward ten years.

Quiet Boy has spent the past decade institutionalized in an asylum, horribly disfigured from that childhood prank.  Doctors think he's a vegetable.  Never talks.  But one night, a nurse doesn't sedate him on schedule.  It never mattered before.  But on this, the ten-year anniversary, Quiet Boy escapes.  He treks forty miles to his hometown in search of his former tormentors (who've all blossomed into stunningly attractive high school seniors, looking too old for high school) and ... the body count mounts!

Of the many slasher films ""inspired"" by Halloween (1978), Offerings is both a latecomer and one of the most slavishly unoriginal.  Its ominous piano score sounds identical to John Carpenter's.  And its killer is an berpsycho, a dark avenging angel of superhuman strength and endurance.

[I coined the term ""berpsycho"" in my essay, ""But Is It Horror?  Defining and Demarcating the Genre"" to distinguish the indestructible post-Halloween ""horror psycho"" from the more vulnerable ""suspense psycho"" of such earlier films as Frenzy.  For a fuller analysis, read this essay in my book: Halloween Candy.]

With one hand, he lifts a struggling victim off her feet.  He tosses a noose around another victim and hauls him up the side of a house without trouble.  He is shot several times, but continues relentlessly.  A sign warns Danger! High Voltage, yet he grips the electric fence and climbs over.

(Blooper: the electric fence stands isolated.  Aren't all ""live"" fences positioned between dead fences?  Otherwise, innocent passersby, on either side, might mistakenly touch it.)

There are some clever deaths and attempts at black humor, and director Reynolds can stretch a low budget.  One victim is dragged under bed, his legs flailing, then shuddering, then the blood.  That's one way to save on effects: hide the mayhem under bed.  Another cost-saving method is to show a screaming head set to be split, then cut to its shadow as it's finally cracked.  We hear only the head split, and see blood spattering the shadow.  Not necessarily great art, but journeyman competence.

As in Halloween, there's the requisite good girl, Gretchen (Loretta Leigh Bowman, who is pretty, but lacks Jamie Lee Curtis's range and intensity).  As a child, Gretchen was the one neighborhood kid who defended Quiet Boy.  As an adolescent, Gretchen honors her parents, and says ""no"" to the boys.

Quiet Boy remembers Gretchen's kindness.  As he butchers and slaughters his former tormentors (Gretchen's friends), he leaves their body parts on her porch -- his ""offerings"" of gratitude and love.  (Don't worry: he doesn't just kill his former tormentors, but anyone in his path, so the body count is generous.)

Attempts at black humor include a finger eaten by a dog and pizza topped with human flesh.  (A joke too stale to be funny.)  Reynolds's broad range of levity also encompasses masturbation and porn jokes, and mocking the boob tube (another old film conceit).  One dying boy flails outside the window as his parents watch TV laughing at cartoons.  Elsewhere, teenagers watch a horror film on TV, commenting on the characters' stupidity.

Playing off this ""in joke,"" the characters in Offerings are just as dumb.  After being knocked out, one teen awakes strapped upon a tool table, his head clamped in a steel vise (not very convincingly).  He asks: ""Hey, is this a joke?  Very funny, guys.  C'mon, at least loosen the straps.""  Yeah, sure it's a joke.  My friends are always braining each other, then strapping themselves under drill presses and before circular blades.

Despite following the Halloween blueprint, Offerings suffers from structural sloppiness.  Quiet Boy is said to have cannibalized his mother (hence, the pizza toppings?).  But when might he have eaten mom?  She was fine before the prank, immediately after which Quiet Boy was institutionalized.  Quite a plot hole.

Also, it's nighttime in Oklahoma when Gretchen's parents phone from Hawaii.  Considering the time difference, and assuming it's May or June, the airport in ""Hawaii"" still looked too bright for evening.  The shadows were long but distinct, and the sky was too bright.  It looked like mid-morning in Hawaii and midnight in Oklahoma.

As in much low-budget exploitation indie fare, the lighting is flat rather than atmospheric.  And the no-name cast gives a mostly stilted performance (apart from two hams -- a gravedigger and a deputy).  However, Offerings went the extra mile to offer night-for-night photography, always a plus in horror.  And in addition to its Carpenter-like piano score, Offerings also has generic spacey musical effects, at times sounding like a 1950s sci-fi film.  A peculiar choice, but nicely eerie.

The end credits indicate that Offerings was shot with some assistance from the University of Oklahoma's film department, and indeed, some of the film is shot on campus.  Maybe this was a film school project?  Offerings is woefully unoriginal compared to some of the work produced at the more prominent film schools at NYU, USC, UCLA, and AFI.  Still, it's nice to see a film school take an interest in a feature length slasher film.

Choosy audiences will wish to decline these Offerings, but aficionados of low-budget indie horror should be more forgiving. Offerings delivers what it offers ... a generic but serviceable berpsycho body-count film.",1130976000,8,5939,5.118873826903024
1879012,3,B000094FFV,"I'm being generous by giving this a three star rating because I'm a huge fan of cheesy 80s slasher films. Unless you're the same, this probably won't interest you. This movie is perfect if you want to invite your friends over, drink a few beers and watch something funny. If you were to watch Offerings hoping to be wowed with the horror and violence you'd not only be disappointed, but you'd notice that the director shamelessly makes a blatant rip off of Halloween. Everything from the escape from a mental hospital, and the way the killer walks, all the way up to the climax music is identical to Halloween. Buy this if you like horror films that are funny for all the wrong reasons. If you're looking for a serious slasher to watch, I'd strongly recommend Michele Soavi's Stagefright.",1076630400,3,788,4.676258992805756
1879013,1,B000094FFV,"I had seen Offerings when I was younger and I'm surprised a company wasted time to make a DVD for this film. First off the plot of a pyscho escaping from a mental hospital has been done a million times(Halloween was the orginator)and at least if your going to copy a classic Horror movie have the dignity of making it enjoyable. Offerings is not enjoyable,it is a story of a boy who was pushed in a well by some kids when he was young and now he seeks revenge. The problem is that their is so much wasted time between death scenes the movie grows tiring,plus the death scenes are stupid. For instance in one scene it looks like a shotgun is walking by itself and then somebody gets shot under a bed but its censored so we don't see a thing. This movie drags on and never redeems itself for the wasted hour. SKIP THIS BAD FILM AND GO WATCH THE ORIGINAL HALLOWEEN AGAIN!",1059264000,,868,4.266666666666667

Offerings (1989) * / 4
D: Christoper Reynolds
C: Loretta Leigh Dowman, Elizabeth Greene, G. Michael Smith, Tobe Sexton
P: After being pushed down a well by neighborhood bullies and institutionalized, a young man escapes from an asylum and returns to his hometown to murder those very bullies.

A defining, but shocking moment in a kid's life that resulted in him being sent to an asylum. That now grown kid escapes from the same mental asylum. That now grown psycho returns to his hometown to start a murdering spree. Sound familiar? Well... just in case you haven't picked up on the film that Offerings is so blatantly copying, it's Halloween.

When reviewing a film that is a copy of another film, comparisons are unavoidable. In Halloween, Michael Myers murdered his family for apparently no reason. As an adult, he returned to his hometown to kill for what was apparently no reason yet again. The film talks about the boogeyman and in essence Myers became the boogeyman.

In Offerings, we see the antagonist, his troubled childhood and a traumatizing series of events. The killer here is all too human with nothing distinctive about him other then the fact that he offers up body parts as offerings to a childhood friend. In doing so, the killer just ends up being another crazed person who had a troubled past. Watching this film, it does nothing but bring back memories of other films and realizing that this film is nowhere near their league. [R] 95 mins.",1388275200,2,1552,4.845283018867924
1879039,2,B000094FFV,"Offerings came out in 1989, at a time when teen slasher flicks were at their all-time worst and every week there seemed to be a new turd flooding the cinematic toilet bowl. Offerings was just one of many films to rip-off the horror classic `Halloween', in order to cash in on the trend. But while most movies had the decency to hide their plagiarism, Offerings just said 'whatever' and went all out! The similarities are just too many to count. Lemme try to break it all down.

First, I should explain the plot of the movie.

A bunch of kids on bikes start terrorizing this little shy kid for never talking. The little shy kid has an abusive mother, who is masterfully played by Demi Moore, who likes to torture animals, and has a little pig-tailed girlfriend who looks like Cindy from the brady bunch. When the children of the corn pressure the shy kid to walk around a well, he does it, but the kids push him in anyway, and they run away.

10 years later, the shy kid is being treated in a medical center and eacapes by stabbing his nurse in the brain with a needle. He then goes back to his old town and starts killing all the little jerks that pushed him down the well. After each killing he gives a body part to his old girlfriend, that's why the movie is called offerings. A fat sheriff is sent in the town, wonderfully played by Louie Anderson, but he doesn't do anything what so ever. After all the teens have been killed, the killer comes for his old girlfriend, with predictable results.

Now that you know the generic plot to the movie, lets reach deeper into this rotten stinkhole and analyze at the acting. Well, its sub-par to say the least. The actors are so stiff and uninspired that its painful to try and watch them attempt communication amongst one another. They cant even die right. But maybe Im beeing too hard on the actors, I mean, for the characters and dialogue they were given, how good could they possibly be?

The characters, oh man, lets take a closer look at these wonderful fellows. Some of my favorites include...

The creepy mortician intern
The kid's mom and dad
The guy who gets his head squished in a vice
Ben Dover- The horny Ginger kid

But the list of ridiculous and out of place characters wouldn't be complete without the idiot cop, who somehow rose through the ranks and has become a detective. He knows about the serial killer, and how he escaped from the mental institution, yet he convinces the two girls that its all just a joke, after they find an ear in the newspaper. I think if I found a nose in a newspaper or an ear on my dorrstep, Id probably freak out. But no, they stay in the house and wait for the killer to, well, kill em'(maybe she was just afraid the neighbors dog would attack again) .

Then, the detective gives the job of protecting the girls to the most ill-conceived and thoughtless character Ive ever seen in a movie, ever. He is the most brainless, idiotic, unbelievable detective ive ever seen in a movie. Other then that the film is filled with generic and flat characters that just get murdered right away and a dumb blonde main character with bad teeth.

You thought that was the worst this movie had to offer, no, no no no, hell no. It gets much worse. The movie is filled to the brim with filler and pointless scenes of stupidity that leave me baffled and utterly depressed. Offerings made me lose all respect for mankind. There is no going back after watching this movie. Watch at your own risk!",1363478400,,3469,4.433281004709576
1879040,2,B000094FFV,"This is a review for the actual Madacy produced dvd. There is a few other copies of the film floating around the five dollar range, I belive its the copy I got which is made for the Dead of Night Collection. It's region free without the trailer and I think the transfer is a little better on the offical release.

Offerings is called a cheap Halloween rip off. Then again, what horror movie isn't ripping off another film? This movie is about a boy who doesnt speak and is dared to walk across the well. He falls in and the movie skips to ten years later where is in a hospital. He looks much older then he should but thats the beauty of movies. Anyways, he gains revenge on the kids that tease him. This movie is very slow and about forty minutes into the film a character sums up the movie the best in one line-this show is boring. There is little gore, the killings are mostly unseen, and very little blood. I really don't recommend this movie to anyone and i'll watch any horror film if it's from the 80's. The picture and sound is quite good but it does get dark during the final climax and the movie gets shaky during the last few minutes but I don't know if it was meant to look that way.

7989255,5,B000094FFV,"Offerings is a late eighties slasher movie that directly copycats elements of Halloween and Halloween II. Now, while most slasher movies of the eighties copied Halloween in some way, none are anywhere as identical as Offerings. The killer is an escapee from an asylum. His doctor helps in the search around the small town. Heck, even the music sounds the same.

However, even with all this in mind, Offerings is an excellent and enjoyable entry in the slasher genre that most fans of low-budget, badly acted, cult movies will love it. I know I love it.

It has some fun kill scenes and some great atmosphere. Even though the characters are underdeveloped, they're a joy to watch. The Blu-ray edition has a decent transfer that looks crisp but has just enough graininess for nostalgia. The one downside is there are no special features to speak of--but this isn't a Scream Factory release, so that's to be expected.
