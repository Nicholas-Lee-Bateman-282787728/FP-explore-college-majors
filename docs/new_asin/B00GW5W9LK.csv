8627923,1,B00GW5W9LK,"Not the same show, First two seasons were a gritty female OZ in a corrupt prison. 4-5 Stars!

 Now we have occult worshipers controlling the masses with mind controlling internet videos, meeting in secret, trying to take control of the whole country while they do human sacrifices in hooded robes and try to create some master-race. This can not be the same writers from the first two seasons.

The gritty prison drama is mostly gone replaced by some crazy occult sci fi plot.",1405382400,,476,4.710843373493976
