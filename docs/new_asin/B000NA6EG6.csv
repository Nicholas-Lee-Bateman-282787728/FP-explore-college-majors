This person is an avid history buff-not to mention a HUGE Dylan Thomas Fan!!!! I was not happy-AT ALL-to discover that due to ""formatting""-(NTSB) the DVD is NOT, I REPEAT, NOT compatible with my DVD Player! I invested money in a product -in GOOD FAITH-and I can't even SEE the product I was going to present to this person -and for their anniversary gift to boot? There must be someone-somewhere-ON EARTH-who knows how to propwerly format this film so I can give this as an anniversary gift-to the person to whom it was intended!!!! I am also a BIG Dylan Thomas fan as well- Is there anyone out there who could help me with this????",1384819200,,803,4.544827586206897
