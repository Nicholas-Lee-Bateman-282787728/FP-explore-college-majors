There are several variations and lots of opportunity to add your own creative touch.  My original DVD was faulty  and the seller gets an A+ in customer service.  The product was replaced without any hassle.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in creating unique rosary beads, nor would I hesitate to buy another product from this company.",1193875200,,510,4.872093023255814
8187521,4,B000OXEP4A,"I'd llike to say this is a really nice DVD. But it froze up on me and I couldn't get past the problem so I haven't seen the whole thing yet.  But the rosaries are beautiful. I  already have figured out a much easier way to make the roses, however, the ideas on the dvd are inspiring.",1186531200,,283,3.9473684210526314
