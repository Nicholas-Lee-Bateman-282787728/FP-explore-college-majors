8730000,5,B0147KJN4W,"Brilliant musicians playing one of the greatest quartet pieces on magnificent instruments. Beautifully filmed and recorded absolutely five stars.

Not Transcendent, however for a self-inflicted flaw I cannot fathom. There is no surround mix of the audio. What in the world were they thinking? Five cameras, but somehow it's not worth taking the minor extra effort to add a 5.1 mix so the instruments don't have to share only two speakers. I'm listening on Martin Logan Montis powered my a McIntosh amp, so the stereo sound is wonderful, almost transcendent. But there are three other speakers sitting idly by not given the chance to fill out the soundstage even more.

Don't hesitate to buy this even if you have a 5.1 listening system, or absolutely if you listen in stereo. My complaint is the ultimate in first world problems. But c'mon people, it's a Blu Ray use it properly.",1476489600,,879,4.89261744966443

8730002,5,B0147KJN4W,"I always enjoyed Schubert's String Quartet No. 15 in G major, D. 887. His last one. I enjoyed it with Emerson Quartet CD recording, but I am not aware of any video version. This Miro Quartet's performance  blew my mind. What a treat with the video image of the performance and listening to my favorite string quartet performed superbly. To top it off, there is a documentary to get acquainted with the members of Miro and showing of all the instruments. Thank you Miro Quartet. It will be a treat to any classical music lovers.",1458518400,,527,4.5473684210526315

8730004,5,B0147KJN4W,"I have been fascinated by this quartet since I first heard a recording by the Julliard String Quartet which I purchased in the early 70's.  That recording was on vinyl and mono, but the performance immediately grabbed me and made me an instant Schubert lover.  This quartet which was written about 2 years prior to Schubert's death (at age 31) has a depth and sense of urgency
 which probably comes from the fact that the composer had contracted syphilis approximately 3 years earlier, and he knew that his life would not be long.
This recording is probably the finest one I have ever heard.  The quality of the recorded sound (especially on the blue-ray disc) is remarkable.
It is a mind blowing piece of music, especially when you realize that Schubert wrote this piece and put it on the shelf, where it remained until 20 years after his death.
The opening movement gives a sense of pathos and angst found in few other pieces.
Highly recommended.",1453593600,2,948,4.692771084337349

A great production!",1445299200,,146,5.681818181818182
8730006,5,B0147KJN4W,"Start up this recording and in just a few seconds you can already tell that you're in for a treat. Crystal clear video and audio that seems to put you in the front row. I do love string quartets and I love the Blu-Ray format too, but there's not many string quartets to choose from in Blu-Ray format as I write this. I searched Amazon for ""Blu Ray String Quartet"" and that's how I happened to find this recording. I'm so glad I did. Hello Miro...if you read this, please release more string quartets on Blu-Ray! What a treat this one was. I love it. 5 Stars without a doubt!",1443916800,,574,4.2272727272727275
