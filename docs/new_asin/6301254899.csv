321766,3,6301254899,"So my understanding is that this is an adaptation of CQ Yarbro's 1983-84 novel. Some folks think it is the other way around however I have an original publication and it has NO mention of this movie and is 2 years before the film. Most books do not come out that much sooner than the film they are connected with.
Anyway you would be better off reading the book if you can get a copy to answer some of the questions that are never answered in this film.
Don't get me wrong, I like the film admittedly I was a fan of Adam Ant and heard about it because of his involvment in the project. But on the whole the film is facinating and suspenseful, The acting is OK, a bit on the cheesey side but it is still fascinating.  I think the biggest disapointment for me was that they just don't explain enough of what is happening to the doctor and what happened to Pierce's character. And that is just a shame, because that is the main reason why this film failed, nobody understood it. If they had just explained a little more of what was happening and why it happened it would have helped a great deal.
But if you have questions that still need answers, find a copy of Ms. Yarbro's novel. It makes the story much clearer than the film and is a superb story that I don't think has been used before or since to this degree.",1040256000,5,1312,4.2063492063492065

321771,4,6301254899,"I saw this movie about 4 yrs ago and found it to be really really good. I have heard so many stories as to how this film bombed in the US Box office and how director John Mctiernan got his break to direct the sci fi classic Predator. The truth is this film stands on it own and Lasley Anne Down gives a superb perfomance as a derainged Doctor who posses the spirit of Brosnan.
It's rare to see a suspense/horror movie like this but with films like Sixth Sense and The Others coming out these days audience might just love the film for it's origianlity.
Brosnan is in top form here to play an accentric photographer trying to escape a group of punks who he believes to be nomads with dissastruos results. The director who usualy gives us steriod injected camera movements(i.e very fast moving)doesn't let us down one bit on his motion picture debut!",1015459200,5,848,4.4423076923076925
321772,4,6301254899,"John Mctiernan's 1986 release, ""Nomads"", may not be a perfect film but in a genre (horror) cursed all to often with cliche, derivative story lines and stupidity in general, it is an imaginative, compelling, and suspenseful entry.
The film opens with emergency room doctor Eileen Flax (easy on the eyes Lesley-Anne Down) being attacked by a madman (Pierce Brosnan, suave even as he froths and foams) who has been hauled raving in French to the L.A. hospital where she has recently begun work after a divorce and subsequent move from Boston. Soon thereafter she begins to relive - through some kind of telepathic bond with the dead man (the nature of which is not explained) - the last few days of his life. We learn that the mad Frenchman was an anthropologist named Jean-Charles Pommier, only just settled in L.A. with his wife (beautiful red-head Anna Maria Monticelli) after a decade or so spent tracking remote areas of the earth in the study of nomadic peoples. Unfortunately, the house they have moved into was the site of a recent murder and seems to be a magnet for a gang of wild and mysterious characters (Adam Ant, Mary Woronov and others) who drive around in a black van. Pommier follows this group into the night and the mystery that brought him to the hospital in the opening moments of the film begins.
I understand that the narrative structure of the film, which shifts between past and present via the agency of the mysterious bond between Flax and Pommier, confuses many people. I hate to sound snobbish but for me this is more an indication of the general low level of the typical movie viewers intelligence than a failure on the film makers part. This is not an ""easy"" movie; it requires that some attention be paid and for me the reward is worth the effort. The film is not completely successful, however. There are times, for instance, when I (who appreciate the ambiguous element of a well crafted tale) would like a bit of elaboration or explanation - the telepathic bond, for example, or the scene in which Pommier, after being pursued by the black van bunch, finds himself in a deserted building with a strange old nun (who is she precisely?). Also, the rock soundtrack by Bill Conti and Ted Nugent is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of effectiveness, alternating between appropriate and annoying. But, on the whole, I find this a creative, engaging and, ultimately, satisfying ghost story.",1012262400,23,2413,4.720379146919432
321773,2,6301254899,"Nomads (John McTiernan, 1986)

Having read Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's adaptation of this script a few months back, I was pleasantly surprised to see it crop up on a movie channel, and I sat down to give it a go. I concluded that Yarbro's above-average novel was written from the original script, not the finished product, and that some ham-handed editor had a field day with this thing between McTiernan and the big screen. I spent a few minutes being amazed that such a shabby cut-job made it to release, but then I remembered that McTiernan's second feature, _Die Hard_, lost almost an hour of the director's cut on initial release, too. Someone up there just doesn't like John McTiernan, even though his films have grossed something close to a billion dollars, all told.

The story introduces us to Eileen Flax (Lesley-Anne Down), an ER doc who finds herself confronted with a violent nutzoid type who's on his way off this mortal coil (Pierce Brosnan). Before he dies, said nutzoid bites Dr. Flax, and in some way this causes her to relive his final days. Turns out said nutzoid is Jean-Charles Pommier, world-famous sociologist and studier of nomads, and his profession has gotten him in some rather hot water. Can Flax get herself off Pommier's track before she ends up facing the same fate he did?

Read the novel before you see the movie. Whole subplots disappear. Flax's best friend goes from being one of the novel's major roles to being such a minor character in the film she's not even credited. (Not even on IMDB-- that's MINOR.) If you've read the novel, you'll at least be able to figure out what's going on; otherwise, you'll probably say ""what just happened?"" at least ten times while trying to piece together what's left of this. Unwatchable, unless someone bothers to release a director's cut. Since it's McTiernan, that's a distinct possibility, but it doesn't exist as of this writing. * 1/2",1008115200,6,1908,4.793313069908814

That being said, there is much to admire here. He gets great performances from Pierce Brosnan and the lovely Lesley Anne-Down. His story is better than his film: the notion that the Inuit are careful about meeting anyone out in the wild (because he or she might actually be an evil spirit in human form) is fascinating.

 Unfortunately, he relies on Adam Ant and contemporary punks to portray the spirits. In the end, Adam Ant is notably Adam Ant, and Pierce Brosnan's appearance at the end--as a dead man come to also be a motorcycle driving evil spirit--is predictable.",1443139200,,711,4.717741935483871
321901,5,6301254899,"I have never seen such mixed opinions for a movie. Half the reviews are giving it 1%, the other half gives it 5% w/ a few in between. The people that gave it one star do so for the dumbest reasons. Look, this is an 80's horror/sci-fi w/ not the highest budget. If you watch this for the first time NOT expecting at least a LITTLE cheeziness or dated retro hair-rock synthesizer music, then you need a serious edumacating on the 80's. For those who DO love the 80's and all its campy splendor, you will love this.  Acting is good, specially the woman. Brosnan is okay for an early role, and the music/effects are super dated(which I love personally). This is a Scream Factory presentation Blu Ray. There transfers are terrific, they provide good extra's and they always have inside artwork which is a breath of fresh air for a collector, after buying countless Blu Ray's w/ not only NO inside artwork but that stupid recycling sign punched out of the case. Scream Factory doesn't let down, but you have to know what you are buying(which a lot of people whom gave this 1 star didn't). Nearly all of the films I have purchased that were Scream Factory Blu Ray's are lost gems, obscure low budget horror or forgotten films that never made it past VHS. Films like Sleep Away Camp 3, The Howling 2, Pumpkinhead, Class Of 1984, The Beyond, Motel Hell, etc... So, in the future people, look at what studio distributed the Blu Ray you are buying, if it says Scream Factory you should know what you are getting. As for me, I go out of my way to buy films specifically from Scream Factory. They cater to Horror fans of many ages and categories.

321950,3,6301254899,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Released in 1986 at the height of Pierce Brosnans fame starring on the TV series REMINGTON STEELE, this movie did little at the box office and about the same on VHS. But that didn't stop fans of the movie from seeking it out every chance they got. Did it deserve that notoriety? Not quite but it isn't that bad a movie and worth taking a look at.

Brosnan plays French anthropologist Jean Charles Pommier who turns up in the emergency room of an LA hospital where Dr. Flax (Lesley-Anne Down) is on call. Strapped to a table hes been ranting along the way in French and no one can understand him, He suddenly pop his restraints, whispers something into her ear and collapses, dying in the process.

Whatever it was he whispered it has an effect on Flax. She suddenly sees things through the eyes of Pommier, things that happened to him in the past. Reacting to what she sees rather than whats going on around her she soon walks into things and shortly after collapses herself. When she wakes she thinks shes fine but soon after she falls to the floor again, still seeing what it was that went on in the last few days of Pommier.

Told in flashback with occasional pops into the present, we learn to story of Pommier. He has been around the world studying other cultures, recently in the Arctic Circle studying eskimos. Now along with his wife he has decided to settle down and take up residence in LA. But strange things begin to happen at their new home. He sees a gang of street punks riding around the neighborhood. Then one night he finds his garage door spray painted. Following the gang he tracks them down and soon discovers to his dismay that these are not an ordinary gang of young punks. They are instead nomads.

This is where something new is given to us, an explanation of what nomads in this sense are. These are earthbound malevolent spirits that follow someone they attach to until their end. Now on the run and trying to escape these demons Pommier soon finds that there is no safe haven in which to do that. In the end he passed along this curse if you will to Flax who now must face the same spirits as well with the help of Pommiers wife.

The movie is not an effects laden horror film with floating apparitions on the loose. Instead the nomads are presented as a street gang from the eighties complete with long leather jackets, spiked hair, garish makeup and the odd piercing here and there. Led by Adam Ant who you can barely recognize, the threat they present isn't all that terrifying with the exception of the fact you can never seem to escape them.

The movie has that definite eighties look about it between the costumes and the location shoots were offered. The California beach and boardwalk scene has never looked better. The same cant be said for the punk outfits which seem far too fresh and far too expensive to actually appear like something punks of the time would wear. A minor quibble to be sure but still.

The acting here doesnt stand out for any involved but it is passable enough to be far better than most made for VHS movies of the time. Perhaps the most startling thing about the movie is that its the first effort by director John McTiernan who co-wrote the screenplay as well based on the book by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro. It shows on IMDB as the only writing credit he has. After this movie McTiernan went on to direct his next film, PREDATOR, followed by DIE HARD and THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. The style he brought to those films isn't quite as apparent here.

In the end this isn't a bad movie but its nothing fantastic either. Its a decent nights entertainment and one for fans of Brosnan who want to collect everything hes ever made. The quality of the film making here is better than most but in the end offers nothing spectacular. There is a hard core group of fans out there who have developed this film into a minor cult status and for them the arrival of this film on blu-ray should make them ecstatic. The rest of us can just enjoy it and then let it go.",1440547200,,4063,4.428380187416332

Seeing in 2015, I winced at Pierce Brosnan's French Accent. It seemed to move in and out of Italian, Spanish, Brogue; the lovely, lyrical French accent... missing. A Frenchman, I fear not. But I forgave it. I didn't notice when this movie first made it's debut (I'm guessing now) in later 80's.

Very cool premise. Nomads, in this case, is attributed to mysterious persons, evil like, supernatural beings. Constantly, on the move from place to place; blending mostly.  Sort of cool, checking out the 80's sense of style... Madonna, Benatar, Nice Day for a White Wedding Billy Idol.  Yeesh. What we embraced as hip and in fashion.

Never the less, I felt supremely satisfied to re-see this movie of my younger years. And it's an excellent premise; harkening back to Inuit legends of avoiding strangers when one is alone on the ice fishing.  Evil strangers pretending to be what they're not.

Brosnan's wife is a scene stealer. Now she's French.

And Adam Ant is featured in a darker capacity.

Personally I think he was just someone who wanted out of his marriage and start a new life, if we're to analyze this in a rational manner.

I do have to give some credit.  This movie keeps you guessing.  Will Pierce's wincingly bad accent disappear mid-line (Yes!)?  Or will it become more wincingly pronounced toward the end of the sentence? (Also yes!)  Is the waxing and waning of the accent symbolic or merely foreshadowing?  Can you predict which cliche will next make its appearance (I couldn't!) ?  When will the first nipple appear (center frame!)?  Who invented heavy metal elevator music and where are they incarcerated?

There are many unanswered questions, in part because i only made it 2/3 of the way through the film.  So perhaps all of my concerns are addressed or even transcended.  But I have an uncannily strong feeling...that they aren't.

I haven't seen this film in many years and yet, it is just as I remembered. A well done film that sends chills up and down my spine everytime I see it! I have watched this 3 times since I purchased it and it never bores me!

""Nomads"" stars the lovely Lesley-Anne Down and Pierce Bronson in my favorite of all his films, with the James Bonds films all coming in at close seconds. Both give excellent performances as well does the rest of the supporting cast, Adam Ant, Anna-Maria Monticelli, Hector Mercado, Mary Woronov (Best known for all those great B-Budget films we all know and love), Josie Cotton and even the guy who's name I can't remember at this time who played ""Bubba"" on the CBS tv series ""In The Heat Of The Night"".

What makes ""Nomads"" such a great cult classic is not only great casting, acting, writing and directing but the musical score, as well. This film relies on scaring the crap outta you with spine-chilling moments without all the gory effects that most horror films rely on, even today, not that I don't have a great love for those films because I really do, but I love to be scared so bad that the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

All-in-all, if you want to watch a film that will give you many jumping outta your skin moments, ""Nomads"" is an excellent way to go!!!",1302739200,3,1411,4.277153558052435
322209,5,6301254899,"This movie scared the daylights out of the youthful me. Upon rewatching as an adult who has actually witnessed rather scary things, well, it is still deeply unsettling. It isn't scary horror, like monsters or some freak with a chainsaw jumping out at you. That sort of thing never really put the spook into me. I come from a long line of laconic people who enjoy having grenades thrown at them, so the petty tricks relied on by most ""horror movies"" end up barely registering on my autonomic nervous system. This isn't one of those kinds of movies: this is a ghost story -and a very good one.

It is of course, a deeply ridiculous movie. The acting is fairly cut-rate, though it manages to be powerful anyway. Pierce Brosnan's ""french"" accent is preposterous and laughable, as is Anna-Maria Monticelli's (despite her apparently having some French roots; she don't sound French to me). The plot holes are enormous. Yet, they manage to immerse the viewer into their wild eyed terror most convincingly. This makes no sense: the ""villains"" are Adam Ant, who is about as scary as a cute and fuzzy bunny rabbit, and Mary Woronov, who generally portrays humorous characters in MTV Videos. They're still terrifying.

Is it because I first watched this as a teenager? Nope; don't think so. I think this movie is just plain scary. The ghost story is rarely done well, but when it is, it conveys a true spookiness and soul-etching horror that regular ghouls and goblins, or dudes in hockey masks can't. I think the movie which it best compares to is Kwaidan -another very good set of ghost stories.",1290384000,3,1586,4.722021660649819

322249,5,6301254899,"This 1986 thriller stars Pierce Brosnan, Lesley-Anne Down, Anna-Maria Monticelli and Adam Ant.

Brosnan is an French anthropologist who for years studied nomadic tribes and peoples in various remote parts of the world.  He decided to settle down and lead a more conventional lifestyle. Thus he moved with his wife (Anna-Maria Monticelli) to southern California to embark on a new career as a UCLA professor of Anthropology.

The movie opens up with Jean Pommier (Brosnan) in the hospital emergency room where he is bloody, beat-up and brought in by paramedics.  He wispers one word, Innuit, in the ear of Dr. Eileen Flax (Lesley-Anne Down), bit her ear and then died.  The Dr. Flax then relives Pommier's last few days and tries to uncover the mystery of his death and try to stop the demons before she suffers the same fate as Pommier.

During the trip back, we encounter a strange group of nomadic urban gang-like, up-to-no-good people led by Adam Ant (kind of reminded me of the group in Clockwork Orange). They are terrorizing Pommier's house and new neighborhood in a black van.  Pommier discovers that they are no different than the nomads he tracked in the remote areas of the world.  He's intrigued and follows the group around, taking notes and photos, none which come out, but that adds to the chilling thrill ride that this movie takes you on.  To reveal anymore would give away the film.  This is now one of my top 10 favorite movies---a must see and buy.",1211500800,7,1467,4.762845849802371

The acting was only fair and even Pierce Brosnan seemed stiff and uncomfortable in this role.  And, as for the ""male frontal nudity,"" that's a joke too.  Pierce is naked but the shadows are so dark nothing is visible in the scene.

They move into their house and find that it has been vandalized by some local riffraff (goth-like young ruffians) driving around in a van.

The instincts of the anthropologist (Jean-Charles Pommier played by Pierce Brosnan) kick in and he's on their trail - the trail of the ""Nomads"".

Now most of the story is actually told through the mind/memory of a medical doctor (Lesley-Anne Down as Dr. Eileen Flax).  She treats the anthropologist at the hospital when he is near death from violent injuries. (this happens at the beginning of the movie). Before he dies he communicates his soul/memory to her.

This movie is haunting, intelligent, beautifully directed - very well acted and last but not least - very interesting.

322254,5,6301254899,"""You, they know about you."" This may be the most chilling line of dialogue ever delivered on film. It is the pivotal moment in the movie, the moment of realization that not everything we see is real. Whether we want to belief it or not, forces exist in the universe that we dismiss or ignore at our own peril.

Such is the moment of truth for Jean-Charles Pommier (Pierce Brosnan), a sophisticated, well respected anthropologist newly arrived in Los Angeles and about to embark on a new phase in his career as a professor of Cultural Anthropology at UCLA. After years of living in some of the most remote regions of the world studying the spiritual beliefs and customs of nomadic cultures, Jean-Charles is reluctant but willing to leave the  spiritual cosmos of the 'primitive' for a better life with his wife in sunny California.

He soon discovers that things are no different in the urban sprawl of a major city than they are anywhere else. The very first day in their new home Pommier encounters a troublesome, unruly band of misfits driving around the neighborhood in a black van. Curious about their anti-social behavior he follows them about Westwood secretly taking notes and photos of their activities. His findings are unexpected and earthshattering. They are Nomads (hostile, wandering spirits),  and his interest in them has now turned their attention in his direction. The hunter has become the hunted and poor Jean-Charles must attempt to flee from the Nomads before it's too late.

Wonderful performances abound in this film. Pierce Brosnan and Lesley-Anne Down (as Dr. Eileen Flax) are at their best in the lead roles, but it is the supporting cast that really takes this film to a higher level. Anna Maria Monticelli is absolutely beautiful as Pommiers' loving, vulernable wife while Jeannie Elias supplies a Streisandesque burst of energy and a little comic relief as the hardnosed, agnostic best friend of Dr. Flax. Frances Bay who delivers that crucial line of dialogue at the beginning of this review has a small but significant role that she plays to eerie perfection.

There are also amazing performances to be found by those in the role of the Nomads. They don't speak a word yet have the uncanny ability to create the most disquieting, otherworldly atmosphere with nothing more than a facial expression or gesture. They're absolutely mesmerizing. Adam Ant as ""Number One"", Mary Woronov as ""Dancing Mary"" and Hector Mercado as ""Ponytail"" are unforgetable.

Every movie fan knows that the soundtrack plays a major role in the success or failure of a film to create the appropriate mood, or elicit the desired emotional response from the audience. In 'Nomads' Bill Conti and Ted Nuggent have provided the perfect accompaniment, successfully capturing the angry, restless nature of these hostile entities in their hard-driving, discordant rhythms. Like an incessant, demonic heartbeat the thundering music and lyrics of Ted Nuggent coupled with the etheral, exotic sounds of Bill Conti envelope the viewer drawing them into the savage, archaic Underworld of the Nomads.

Departing from the usual action/adventure features he's so well known for, director John McTiernan delivers a stunning masterpiece of psychological, supernatural terror. Nomads is as near perfect as a movie could be. However I will admit if you have a problem with non-linear story lines, or you're not familiar with such esoteric subject matters as territorial spirits and shamanic transference it might be at times a little difficult to follow. Believe me it's worth the effort to stay with it. If you don't understand something just watch it again, you'll be surprised at the depth of the film and what subtle insights you missed during your previous viewing!
