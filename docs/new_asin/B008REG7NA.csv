8530049,4,B008REG7NA,"Every once in a while I rummage through my stacks of CDs and pull out a treasured set. It is to remind me what real Bel Canto singing must have been like in the 1830s when Bellini first presented I Puritani. This CD album is the remastered Maria Callas recording of 1953. Then I was in graduate school and remember that I and my friends marveled at everyone in the cast for such beautiful singing: Callas, of course, di Stefano as Arturo, Rossi-Lemeni as Giorgio and Panerai as Riccardo with Tullio Serafin conducting at La Scala. Her notes were not always on pitch but her agility at fioratura, roulades,trills etc was a marvel but it was all in character. I've loved this opera ever since have seen/heard many performances since. Anna Moffo did a creditable job but Sills, Southerland and E. Gruberova were super creditable as coloratura Bel Canto singers. The Met's recent presentation with Anna Netrebko was not ""Bel Canto"" but was a dramatic and passionate tour de force and a tremendous success.
The present recording is a significant addition to the roster of available discs. The more times I play it the more I like the production. The sets are stark and completely different from any others I've witnessed. They are gloomy, rigid, threatening as befits the Puritans. The gray walls with bullet holes and braille with Bible words certainly sums up their view of life. Just as the gun play of those people is appropriate for the modern religious inhertitors of the Pilgrims, the hard-shell Evangelicals and their obsession with guns and gun-play. The costumes are of the period and stark as the people. The orchestra of the Netherlands Opera and the chorus are at top level and under the firm control of Maestro Giuliano Carella.
The score used in this production purports to be the original score as used at the Paris premiere at Theatre des Italiens January 25, 1835. The critical edition by Fabrizio dela Seta adds much material that has been cut in most performances. There is more for the Henichetta strengthening her character and giving Arturo more incentive to run off with her, some happy time after Arturo returns to Elivira before she goes daft again and in this presentation Riccardo shoots Arturo before the reprieve from Parliment arrives (I don't know if this was in the Paris ed.). Actually there is about twenty minutes more in this production than in the current Met. presentation with Netrebko. (the 2009 Bolonga production with J.D. Florenz with it's additions clocks in about the same as this one.)
The singing in this album is, sadly, not up to the level of the production. The Elvira is Mariola Cantarero who has a light lyric voice, no match for this unforgiving treacherous role. Her high notes are not pretty. The Riccardo of Scott Hendricks is far to dramatic and aggressive. The Giorgio of Riccardo Zanellato is convincing. But the Arturo of John Osborn not only looks good and sounds good but he has a real feel for the beauty in this music. Her part is small but Fredrika Brillenbourg was an impressive Herichetta. In all, a good addition to anyones collection.",1359331200,6,3099,4.816135084427767
8530050,4,B008REG7NA,"Although it's set during a period of considerable interest in English history - the Interregnum that takes in the conflict between the Cromwell's Roundheads and Royalists loyal to the Charles I and the Stuarts - the libretto for Bellini's I Puritani makes little use of the historical circumstances but rather, not surprisingly for an Italian bel canto opera, merely uses it as a backdrop for a story of romantic intrigue.  If the libretto follows a well-worn generic line in this respect, I Puritani - Bellini's last work before his early death - is however rather more interesting musically, having more in common with Verdi than Rossini or Donizetti and showing the composer at his most imaginative and inspired.  It's fortunate then that there is great emphasis and attention paid to this musical aspect in the De Nederlandse production from 2009, but effort is made in other areas of the production in an attempt to make the work a little stronger and more coherent that it might otherwise be.

There's not a great deal one can do with the limitations of the plot, which amounts to little more than a historical romance, and a not very imaginative one at that.  The apparent weaknesses and insubstantiality of the plot are however given something of a boost here by conductor Guiliano Carella returning to the original Paris score of 1835 and reinstating a number of scenes - some of them quite significant - that fill out the detail in the characterisation, and demonstrate the qualities of Bellini's writing even further.  Assisted by a very strong visual concept of the set designs by Es Devlin and by the stage direction of Francisco Negrin, the De Nederlandse production would be in contention for one of the best productions of this work but for the singing, which is good in most parts, but far from the standard needed to really lift this work to the level that is aspired to here.

Visually, the production design strikes an excellent balance between period (or theatrical period) in the costumes and a more modern conceptual approach to the stage design.  Made up of rows of sheets that in Act I create ramparts for the soldiers in one scene before rolling smoothly into another where they show a committee of puritans in rows, there's a wonderful sense of fluidity and continuity created that establishes the somewhat confusing political context and the drama in the most effective and eye-catching manner possible.  Act II and III by contrast are relatively static, but again find strong visual ways to represent both the court that pronounces Arturo's fate and reflect the horror that has afflicted Elvira's mind.  Conceptually, emphasis is also given to words, the steel sheets marked by bullet-holes and rivets that actually form a Braille background (the words of the Bible, I believe, in Dutch), with projections of words of passion and madness from the libretto projected in the latter scenes.

Despite efforts to make this a dramatically strong presentation, the singing isn't quite as consistent.  Mariola Cantarero is a little high and light for the dramatic range required for Elvira and consequently doesn't always make the mark.  She's at her best in Act II, in her scenes of mad delusion, delivering a lovely 'O rendetemi la speme', but her acting is limited elsewhere, and her high notes tend towards a screech.  John Osborn is a terrific lyrical tenor who I like a lot, and he is excellent here throughout as Arturo, but he seems to me to find the role dramatically limiting and doesn't really succeed in bringing the character to life.  There's a little more to get your teeth into in the role of Riccardo, but Scott Hendrix has a tendency to chew the scenery, and considering it's made of steel here, that's quite a mouthful.  He gives it everything of course and sings the role well, but there's more aggression here than art.  The other roles are similarly variable, never quite entirely holding it together either dramatically or vocally, although Fredrika Brillembourg is the best here as Enrichetta.

If the main roles don't stand out as they might, the support they are given by the Chorus of the De Nederlandse Opera is superb, as is the work of the Amsterdam orchestra, who deliver an impassioned performance that is attuned to the dramatic content, directed from the pit by Guiliano Carella who clearly has a lot of love for the work and very specific ideas about how it should be presented.  That passion comes through in the extra features on the Blu-ray disc, which look at the rehearsals and consider the variations of the Paris version of I Puritani in interesting detail.  The quality of the recording is also of a very high standard, with a clear image and strong, detailed High-Definition audio tracks in PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The BD is all-region, BD50 dual layer, 1080i full HD, with subtitles in English, French, German and Dutch.  The booklet contains an essay on the work and a full synopsis.",1350000000,11,4967,4.875296912114014
