2484087,5,B000E1ZK5A,Excellent movie and one of the best for giving your subwoofer a workout. There's some very tense moments as the depth charges get closer and closer to their mark. I think i would've pissed my pants if i were on that sub.,1517356800,,220,4.261904761904762

2484095,4,B000E1ZK5A,"This movie is fun to watch as it has all the elements and ""subplots"" seen in most Sub movies. They did not go overboard with excess mush or gore. The acting is good enough that you feel that you are there. The action and suspense is constant with no lagging or lingering. I am not going to critique the story incase you have not seen the movie. It would be nicer if they had shown the pictures of the actors with their names in the credits instead of just names on a blank screen.",1504915200,,480,4.117021276595745

2484168,4,B000E1ZK5A,"I'm giving this a bit higher rating than I might otherwise because the script and directing are really quite good. Where this jumps the shark is in the casting. Jon Bon Jovi, Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton and David Keith just stick out like sore thumbs.

Here's the scoop. It's WWII in the North Atlantic. A German U-Boat 571, in possession of the infamous Enigma coding machine, is crippled in an attack. An American sub disguises itself as a U-Boat in an attempt to board the 571 and grab the Enigma before the it's rescuers arrive. Of course things don't go as planned.

The opening scenes are a bit stiff as we learn of the woes of Lt. Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) in his not getting a command of his own ship. But as the plot gets under way things step up in a big way. The chess mentality if very good as is the accompanying action. Things move at a brisk pace and a fair number of surprises ensue. The knot tightens and tightens up to the very last minute to  a satisfying conclusion.

The production values are up o the scale of the flick and the cinematography, even in the tight confines of the sub doesn't show its bones. McConaughey is good and many of the crew hold up their end. My beef is,as I said earlier, is in the casting. Keitel is a fine actor, but he is out of place here. He doesn't have all that much to do and he isn't the kind of actor you imagine in such a straight-laced roll. Bill Paxton took a while to find his stride as an actor and that was well after this shoot. He doesn't have a very big part here and he does nothing that will burn in your memory.

This is a good watch. It delivers he goods in a big way. Had they taken that extra bit of care in the casting it would have been so much better.",1473033600,,1726,4.171171171171171

2484185,4,B000E1ZK5A,"I don't believe there's anything historically accurate about this movie but as movies go it's pretty good entertainment. It does a fine job of portraying the sheer terror of being depth charged and the claustrophobia of being closed in big tin can underwater.

The plot is basically that somehow the American intelligence and is to discover that a German U-Boat is laying in the North Atlantic disabled and a team is sent out to recover their Enigma machine. Beyond that the story is pretty wild and not especially plausible but it's plausible enough to make the movie watchable. So just sit back and enjoy the movie. There's enough shooting and explosions to make people who appreciate that kind of thing like the movie and there's enough other stuff for most other people that appreciate a good thriller.",1467417600,,806,4.883211678832117

2484200,5,B000E1ZK5A,"U-571 is about a group of American Navy soldiers sent to retrieve an encryption machine on a German submarine during World War II.  The only problem is that the submarine has sunk, and they're travelling through dangerous German waters.  So upon entering the sub the Germans are waiting for them.

For the most part these Americans stay in the submarine, sometimes avoiding German ships by the skin of their teeth.  The underwater sub passing a German ship by steering underneath of it and avoiding it by merely inches is a good moment, as is the German guy they take hostage and chain to the back of the sub.  He turns out to be more trouble than he's worth.  Also in some instances, some of these American soldiers are able to trick the Germans by speaking German themselves, which is just enough time to take over their ships.

This movie's pretty good for the most part.  The acting's up to par, the story is told really well (and based on a true story I think, given the information we read during the credits) and the suspense is high enough though movies like Saving Private Ryan are *way* more intense.  The violent events that occur in U-571 are really mild compared to a movie like that.  I'd certainly say, as far as war movies go, this movie is fairly mild in the violence department.  Anyway all kinds of famous people such as Bon Jovi, Bill Paxton and Matthew McConaughey star as the soldiers and do a pretty good job.

Some of the bombings we see in the water as the sub passes through near the end of the movie are really creepy.  The film does a good job believably showing the Americans looking up worried for their lives as they pay close attention to the sounds of the bombs, making sure they stay clear of their sub.  Also the segments where the men are stranded in the ocean and see planes passing are memorable because the men often aren't sure if they're Germans or Americans in those planes, and even disobey their commanding officer.

Perhaps the only complaint I can think of is that the actors are never presented in a way where we feel a connection to them.  They don't really reflect on their families or anything of that nature.  More should have been mentioned about their human side and who they are.  Then again by ignoring this aspect, intentional or not, we can see how determined these men were to complete their mission.  So I guess it works either way.

Oh and one final note.  You really need to turn the volume up loud because often during the quieter moments, the conversations these soldiers have with each other are hard to understand.  Make sure the volume is up high.  The talking is quiet and the chaos is loud.  It's one of those type of movies.",1461456000,,2693,4.505154639175258

2484211,5,B000E1ZK5A,"I have to say that it is quite refreshing to watch a submarine & U-Boat movie written and directed by someone that has a passionate interest in the subject.  Leaving out the story for the moment, just the attention to detail of the uniforms, ships, the way the characters act and the props are excellent and you won't find many technical errors.

As for the story?  Bravo!!  It is pure genius to take the premise of a factual story that did happen in history but change it around to make it completely new and interesting for the audience.  Even if you know the factual story this movie is loosely based on you will not be disappointed.  There are so many surprise twists and turns to keep you til the very end.  The characters themselves are also not ""cardboard cutouts"".  Each character is introduced in such a way that you learn their backstory as you get to know them so it doesn't seem forced.  And even though I tried, I couldn't compare any of these characters to ones I knew in history or in other U-Boat movies.

Writing character development in such a way is so nice when it is done right, as it is done in this movie.  You then get to follow those characters through their development and maturing process which makes you care about them even more.  Nothing makes a movie better than when you forget the people on screen are actors and actually care about what is going to happen to their characters.",1456963200,,1411,4.46875

2484283,1,B000E1ZK5A,"Where to begin.  This movie really stunk bad.  Even Jon Bon Jovi was living on a prayer when he was cast in this movie.  It should be called U-571 the movie with the least believeable cast in a submarine movie.  It had a 62 million dollar budget, I'd like to know where 60 million of that went cause it sure didn't look like it went into the movie, maybe bon jovi got it.  The sets and wardrobe didn't really capture the look or feel of the forties like Das Boot did.  The casting was ""off"" in my opinion.  Bill Paxton (RIP Bill), Matthew McConaughey, Jon freakn Bon Jovi really... what were they thinking?  The story was they dress up an American sub to look like a German U-boat then go out to a real German U-boat that is disabled at sea, board it then steal their enigma coding machine so we can break the German codes.  Seems like a fairly decent plot that should make for a decent movie but...  I just couldn't get into McConaughey's acting style in this movie.  He had this weird, wooden way of acting his part that would switch to almost overacting in some scenes when the action level peaked.  I couldn't buy Paxton as a sub commander at all (sorry Bill), I'm too used to seeing him more as a supporting actor not a lead.  Bon Jovi, let me just say if I had never known that he was the leader of one of the most popular 80's hair bands selling millions of albums and selling out venues all around the world I never would have guessed he had it in him by looking at him in character with his hair cut short and looking very much like any other joe the plumber type on the street.  Stick to singing Jon...  The director even went as far as hiring actual German actors to play the crew on the U-boat even having them speak German and using subtitles but again I thought they were just American actors playing Germans.  The U-boat set was fairly accurate but that was because one of the set designers was from Das Boot.  The rest of the sets they built to emulate that 40's war look had authentic vehicles in them but they did the thing that trips up most period movies like that and that thing was that the vehicles looked brand new, didn't have a spot of wear, grime or gunk on em and these are supposed to be war vehicles that are half way through World War 2.  The interesting thing to note though is that Allied forces had already broken the German codes by 1943 or so unbeknownst to the Germans and were very aware of what the Germans were up to.  By the time the U-505 (currently housed at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry) was captured along with its enigma machine, Allied forces had been deciphering German transmissions for a while.  The commander of the task force was nearly court martialed for not sinking the 505 upon capture because the Allied command didn't want the Germans to think we had their code books.  All in all the movie had a lot of action and drama but didn't capture it as well as Das Boot did in my opinion but opinions are like noses, everybody has one.",1426723200,,3000,4.293072824156305

2484300,4,B000E1ZK5A,"This movie to me was a drama instead of an accurate war movie.
True facts are usually boring.
Hollywood uses fictional stories to sell their movies.
Bottom line - They make movies to make money selling tickets, DVDs, BlueRays, and related movie merchandise.
We all must suspend our belief systems when we watch fictional movies.

I enjoyed the story even though it does not accurately depict what really happened.
I thought the acting was well done.  I thought the special effects were well done.
Also, I enjoy color movies.  Many of the truer to life submarine movies are in black and white.

Before this movie, I did not even know the British were trying to steal the enigma machines off of U boats during the war.
I became just a little wiser as a result of watching this movie.

I guess there would have been fewer critics of this film if it was the British navy depicted instead of the US navy.
For that reason, I give this movie only 4 stars.

If you put aside all of the inaccuracies and give the movie a chance, it is enjoyable to watch the drama between characters unfold.

If you would rather watch a comedy submarine movie, go watch Operation Petty Coat with Cary Grant or Down Periscope with Kellsey Grammer.  Neither of these movies are true either.  However, they are enjoyable to watch.",1422057600,,1301,4.573275862068965
2484301,4,B000E1ZK5A,"U-571 had a lot of issues with historical accuracy.  I'm not here to go into that.  I'll review the movie.  The movie was action, drama, a little shipboard (submarine) comedy and some historical value.  The facts remain, an Enigma machine was recovered and that certainly helped the war effort.

Harvey Keitel, long known for his tough guy roles, plays Chief Henry Klough.  You want a tough guy?  Try a bubblehead chief!  Jon Bon Jovi, in another one of his big screen adventures is LT. Pete Emmett.  Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton play LT Taylor and LCDR Dahlgren respectively.

The British were largely responsible for the overall success of these operationsa, and I missed any referemnce to the Royal Navy's role, which, in truth, waS SIGNIFICANT.  AS A BOY, GROWING UP IN CHICAGO, I REMEMBER THE THRILL OF MAKING MY EVERYOTHER YEAR TRIP THE Windy City's Museum of Science and Industry on the near south side of Grqant PARK AT THE LAKEFRONT, KIND OF LIKE A SCENIC CENTRAL PARK BUT ON THE SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN.  AS A BOY WHO FAVORED THE NAVY DUE TO MY BELIEF THAT MY DAD WAS A NAVAL HERO IN THE BIG WAR, I THOUGHT THE LAKE WAS THE NORTH ATLANTIC OR THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PACIFIC.  I WAS AN OFFICER FIGHTING EITHER THE NAZI'S OR THE JAPS On the high seas.  For a boy with a vivid and healthy imagination, I even managed to put the momentary slip on a Museum submarine toyr guide so as to find my self, for a minute or two completely alone in some section of the U-505, the captured German U-boat taken by the Us Navy on  and afer the waar , brought to Chicago as an exzhibit on the east side of the great museum.
  When alone, I silently barked out commands, ""come to course 050, 15 degree down plaNE  ON THE STARBOARD RUDDER, RIG FOR DEPTH CHARGE, ALL AHEAD FLANK SPEED.""  MAN, I WAS SOMETHING.  A 12 yerar old naval hero, along with my execd"" Lt. Cmdr. John Wayne and my diving officer CPO. Lee Marvin, USN.  Ah, youthful imaginatione !  Ain't it grand?  There is some imaginatiuon in this film, from 2000, ""U-571<"" aqnd, despite it's political and actual historical inaccuracies, the everyday life  and dangers of submarine life in wartime are more factual than most people realize
  Service on a sub, from any country, demaNDED A SPECIAL MAN, SOMEONE N OT CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND ABLE TO REMAIN SHARP AND FOCUSED IN MOMENTS OF GREAT STRESS.The scenes earlie on of the German u-571, the boat that the Americans will capture, is under depthcharge attack, prewsaumably by the Royal Navy and , with my 7.1 Onkyto and surround sound listening mode, and a kick in volume, it's get the popcorn, sir, aye-aye, get the pop eye,eye, rig for depthcharge!"" and hang on
  Asplendid reaklistic presentation by the folks at Universal Studios in giving us what almost amounts to a deep ocean version of the opening 20-30 minutes on Omaha Beach"" in ""Saving Pvt Ryan.  I've never seen ""Das BOOTE BUT I HEAR IT IS TERRIFIC, BUT MORE asa s
a human drama and study of men in war, but this is pure adventure with lots and lots ofgripping and edge of your seat tension, expecially as you are being depth charged.  I simply can't imagine such terror, but thousand of men did, from the Axis to the Allies.  Seamen are  seamen, and, in the film, ""Sink the Bismark from the 1960's , the victorious British officers are genuinely remorsefull as they watch, through their binoculars, the carnage on the devks of the Bismark that they have been orderd to inflict upon the greatest battleship in history.  The watch sadly, as she slips beneath the waves.  I wonder, if any english sailors aboard the trio of crussiers that sank the great pocket battleship, might of been humming WILKKLE'S  ""ETERNAL FATRHER, STRONG TO SAVE"".  BE THEY G.I.S. OR MARINES, AIRMEN OR sailors, they were men, men doing a terrible and horrible thing in order to defend their nations and their homes.  At a social, early on in the film, the main characters are aT A N OFFICER'S WEDDING AND THEY ARE DECKED OUT IN ALL WHITE WITH BLACK SHOULODER MOUNTED ""MORTARBOARDS,' and gold appointments, medals , buttons and insignia of rank.  To me, a wide eyed lad with a preference for the Navy, they were knights, perhaps resurrected from an olden age and redressed in modern attire.  The film stars Matthew McConaughey  is Lt Andy Tyler, the exec of the mission,
.  He is disappointed at his most recent request for a command of his own and while voicing his displeasure to the captasin, Bill Paxton, the crews 's party is cut off witrh orders to sail immediatelyon a mission they will be told bout once at sea.  A marine officer, played firmly by David  Keith, comes abouard and the officers soon learn their mission.  They are going to attempt to steal a German Enigma machine from a German uboatthaT HAS BEEN CRIPPLED, BY THE FILMS OPENING DEPTHCHARGE FOOTAGE.  By the way, the American sub has been redesigned to resemble a real U-boat and the American's with the aid of one of their seamen, a kid from a us farm, who speaks perfect German, will help convince the RAl Germans that they are the rescue  sailors come to their aid.  Got it??Soon at sea, the Americans go over the raiding plans under the leadership of Major Coonan (Keith) and as they approach the real  U -Boat, someone panics and sjots are fired.  In a quick and violkent exchange, both sides loose men, but the Us previals .  They begin to transfer the ""Enugma"" and all valuable intelligence to the disguizaed American ""U BOAT"" when the real German sub, sent to aid their Nazi comrades, torpedoes the US sub, sinking it and killing their Captain, (Paxton).  This leaves the eager to command Tyler (MCConaugheyin charge.  So, he gets what he's been wanting, bu the HrAD way.  Not sure that Berlin Knows what has happened, they must now get back to base and, hopefully, the German High Command hasn't discovered the theft of their ""Enigma"" device, or else, it is a waisted mission---The Germans will simply change their codes tonulify the American's efforts, and men will have died for nothing.
  We don't find out, till the end of the movie, that the mission has been a success, but they must contend with a Nazi destroyer they encounter immediately after they have been forced to take over the real German boat, as their's has been sunk.  Lt Mr. Tyler is now Captain Tyler, and as he is close to his nmen, too close according to his tough CPO (Harvey Kitel) he must make draSTIC AND AWFUL DCISIONS CONCERNING THE LIVES OF HIS MEN, WHO LOOK TO HIM LIKE A BIG BROTHER.  KITEL SETS TYLER STRAIGHT and impresses upon the newq commander, the grimness of being a captain.  .
  The business with the Nazi Destroyer is too long to relate here, and you should see it for yourself.  It is a clever and nailbitting episode that occupies a large middle section of the movie.  Captain Tyle devise, purely on his own a plan for sinking the German Destroyer and , while severly damaged a dangerous sequence of events involving the flooding of part of the damaged U-571, with the Americans onboard.  Mr. Tyler, now capotain , must order the sealing of a hatch that will result directly in the death of some of the young American sailors.  It is a guttwrenching and terrible decision for Tyler but he gives the order, thereby allowing the crippled U-571 to survive with most of it's crew alive.  When ytou see the plan, you'll be impressed as I was.
  You will just have to buy this movie and see the reast of it, and I think you will agree, it is a VERY,VERY exciting picture.  Despite the spotty real history of this project inWWII, this film redeemd itself with a tough realistic portrayal of navy tactics and the day to day lives of submariners.  A blockbuster with a great story and screenplay by
Jonathan Mostow and great performances by McConaUGHEY, PAXTON AND KITEL WITH OTHER SMALLER YET COMPELLING CONTRIBUTIONS.  SUPERB",1386201600,,7525,4.633207547169811

2484424,5,B000E1ZK5A,"This is one of my favorite movies for several reasons and I've been procrastinating writing a review long enough!  This is a great war movie and war is hell.  This movie doesn't let you forget it for a second.  Set in WWII and loosely based on some actual events this movie documents the top secret mission given to a Navy submarine captain to capture the infamous ""Enigma device"", a technologically advanced (for the time) encryption device used by the Germans to help them achieve naval superiority during that phase of the war... this is historically accurate too, by the way.  The movie rarely has a quiet moment, where it just glides along the plot line.  Rather it's pretty much edge-of-your seat from one scene to the next, as of course the mission doesn't go nearly as smoothly as planned.

Excellent acting by all parties involved with a few big names there too including  Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel.  Even the German sailors, the ""bad guys"", are characters that develop enough depth that the viewer can sympathize with them right from the start.  Cinematography and special effects are also top notch, even for a movie that first hit theaters in 2000.  Some of the underwater scenes especially bring the tension and physics of underwater warfare to the viewer in a convincing way that very few other war movies ever have.

And as a special treat the surround sound encoding in this movie is AAA+, 10 out of 10 score, and one of a small handful of movies I grab from my collection when I am testing or dialing in a new surround system or just to show a home theater initiate exactly what a good movie should sound like.  The ""depth charged"" scenes in particular, at theater like volume levels, will put you right inside that WWII era submarine and have you looking around the living room for water leaks and broken bolts!  Be advised, it takes a pretty good home theater system, particularly at least one larger powered subwoofer, to make the most out of these surround effects, but on the right system it's easy to see (or rather hear) why this movie was nominated for two awards at the 73rd Academy Awards: Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.  It WON Best Sound Editing and should have won Best Sound Mixing too, in my opinion!

So, whether you are a fan of war movies or simply need another good reference movie to show off your home theater system (or take it with you to the stores shopping for one and have some real fun!) this movie is a MUST HAVE.",1356566400,,2494,4.598194130925508

2484437,5,B000E1ZK5A,"""U-571"" deserves high praise for its professionalism in shaping an adventure war story with exhilarating scenes of danger, chaos, mayhem, action, and `to the final man' heroism. What separates this WWII submarine movie from other similar classics - afterall, it is a sub-genre in and of itself with ""Das Boot"" leading the wolfpack - is its relentless pursuit of mission objectives - despite deadly setbacks. Our Navy captain is killed. Most of the crew are blown away by a German U-boat that comes upon them suddenly and fires a torpodoe into their backside. A lieutenant (played with power and nerve by Matthew McConaughey), his Chief (played with exactness by Harvey Keitel), and other navy seaman-commandoes hold our attention and keep the fire burning along that HOT crescendo-tension line. ""Take it down!"" waves the dying captain as he sinks below the surface of the ocean deep. His last words are a direct order that sets in motion our sacred Acts II and III and our first sudden plot reversal. That chilling, gut-level plotline elevates U-571 into the Classic ranks for future generations.

All actors portray their roles with a sense of natural realism in the rugged, death-defying reality of battling enemy frigates and submarines, including Bill Paxton, David Keith, Thomas Kretschmann, Jon Bon Jovi, Jack Noseworthy, Will Estes, and Tom Guiry. We come away (I believe) from this particular movie with a stoic understanding of what our history books tell us in words: but now we have lived it in this high-end production. Of course, your `best warrior dramas' drop you into the battle and leave you there to fight it out 'tooth & nail' until all or some of us are vanquished. It is satisfying. It demands all can be done by those of us who identify with our fellow warriors up on that screen; given the hard duty at sea after so many are killed or wounded. What do you do next? You can't quit. You make due.

You rise to the occasion. You conduct battle and go into whatever you face with courage and fortitude, with whatever weapons you can lay your hands on. Welcome to dead-on combat. That is the beauty of U-571. It grips you right away. It is a heroic type war film. You are plunged into all manner of deadly fighting. When it is over, you have earned your stripes as a seaman. You have been put to the test. All unities adhered to. Empathy and catharsis run `hot and straight', like torpedoes fired with precision from a submarine. Superior story & direction by Jonathan Mostow, screenplay by Sam Montgomery and David Ayer, editing by Wayne Wahrman, cinematography by Oliver Wood, and a soundtrack work by Richard Marvin. Can only hope that Mostow and his crew make another great war movie.",1334361600,,2706,4.792291220556745

Not to go too deep; so many have already posted excellent (bad - but fitting) reviews to this movie. I'll just add a few observations as well.

* Submarines of the time did not have the capability to conduct sub to sub combat while submerged.  I think they got this confused with Hunt for Red October.

* You wouldn't see a German Destroyer alone that far from the coast.

* If we needed to break the code - I'd assume they didn't know the code - yet they knew that a German Sub was in trouble.

* The enigma machine was a good catch (which the British actually accomplished) but it was the code books that were the real key.

* German plane would have been incapable of reaching that scene.

* Etc....

2484443,1,B000E1ZK5A,"This movie shamelessly says is ""based on real events"". As I believe a U-Boat veteran said about this movie, the only thing ""real"" about it is that there were German U-Boats in the Atlantic Ocean during WWII; the rest is absolute fiction. This movie is not only an insult to the real British seamen who captured the Enigma; it's also an insult to every soldier from every nationality (including USA) who fought against the Germans.

I believe enough time has passed since WWII to portray the enemy in a realistic way, and not just as propaganda caricatures. The Germans in this movie are all portrayed as savage, stupid cowards who cannot shot straight. You have to wonder how a bunch of incompetent cowards, with no shooting ability whatsoever, could conquer almost all of Europe, and how it took almost six years to defeat them.

The string of sheer idiotic plot points is too long to list, but let me just point to some. The experienced German sub crew is fooled into believing an American sub is actually German by simply painting a swastika and soldering a couple of pieces of metal on it. They also aren't resourceful enough to fix their own submarine, but the Americans have it up and running in a matter of seconds even though only one of them speaks German. Even more insulting to the intelligence of the public is that every shot the Americans fire is a miraculous hit, while the Germans miss everything in sight.

It insults the accomplishment of the Allies to portray the enemy as totally incompetent idiots. Their victory is worthless if it's gained against an enemy made up of cowards.

The story begins in Spring 1942. German U-boats attack shipping in the North Atlantic, the supply line from America to England. The Allies can't break the enemy codes used to send messages. A U-boat launches two torpedoes to hit a ship. The appearance of a destroyer causes evasive action. The depth charges draw closer and create damage, the U-boat surfaces. An Enigma machine is used to report damage to Berlin. In the USA there is a celebration among sailors. Their passes are canceled, they return to base for a special operation. Their submarine is loaded with supplies and ships out. We hear the purpose of their mission: to intercept a damaged U-boat and capture the Enigma coding machine. [How did they know?] The German U-boat commander shoots a lifeboat with survivors. The S-33 approaches the U-boat. [Doesn't wearing an enemy uniform violate a Rule of War?]

The disguised sailors successfully board and invade the submarine, their tommy guns conquer the enemy. They capture the coding machine and its papers. The survivors are taken back to the S-33. Suddenly a torpedo hits the S-33 and causes an explosion! The boarders must use the captured U-boat and quickly learn how to run it. A few survivors are found. Somehow, a motor is started and the U-boat proceeds. A German airplane flies over, a destroyer is seen approaching. Can they escape? Destroying the radio shack prevents sending a warning. Can they use their last torpedo to sing the destroyer? The destroyer drops depth charges. The captain has a plan to save their lives by jettisoning garbage. Hersh explains their choices to the captain. More splashes are heard, then explosions coming nearer. The sub drops to 200 meters or 660 feet! Then another problem develops! They bring the U-boat up to the surface. A man must do a job in finding an air leak and turn it off. The destroyer approaches firing their cannon. The air leak is stopped in time. There is a spectacular explosion! The remaining crew abandons ship and paddles away.

This film is dedicated to the Allied sailors and officers who risked their lives capturing Enigma materials from U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic. This occurred in May 1941; October 1942; and June 1944, when U-505 was captured intact. This dramatic film is fictional. Hollywood does drama better than history. The Battle of the Atlantic was won through many means. Building Liberty ships rapidly provided expanded shipping. Small aircraft carriers provided a local air force. Producing more ultra-high frequency radar sets allowed detection of enemy aircraft and ships. Most of all, the convoy system provided collective security. The Allies knew about the Enigma system before WW II began; the machine was invented in the 1920s for businesses. They developed a mechanical device to help in decryption, it later developed into the electronic computer of the 1940s. ""The Ultra Secret"" explained this and was published in the 1970s. The Germans regularly changed their rotor settings but this had a flaw. Knowing the secret message alone won't do much good unless you can take advantage of it.

In 1944 many spies were dropped behind enemy lines ""to learn the secret of the Enigma"". Most were quickly caught and tortured to learn their mission. They were pawns sacrificed to make the enemy believe the Allies could not read the Enigma traffic. Does this film echo that story?",1293494400,,3408,4.994718309859155

2484451,4,B000E1ZK5A,"I am a sucker for submarine movies with interesting captain melodramas.  On that level, which is the stuff of hollywood's art, this film succeeds admirably:  it pulses with life, has very well drawn characters, spectacular special effects, and the pace of its adventure ticks along without a moment's lag.  The guys are on a deadly and vital mission, to steal the enigma machine from the inside of a Nazi submarine.  It is a clandestine operation that must be carried out with precision, some luck, and then there is a very hard fight to survive and accomplish the mission once unforeseen things happen.

I particularly like the characters.  McConnaughey is an ambitious first officer who has been denied his first command, in large part because of his humanity and hence, purported lack of aptitude to make the difficult decisions (i.e. ordering a man to his death, even if he is unsure of the course that must be taken).  Around him are seasoned veterans, including the tough and smart enlisted chief, Keitel.  Once the captain (Paxton) is out of the picture, McConnaughey has to take over, facing down doubts about his ability and plotting a strategy in a near-impossible situation.  This is high drama and the actors pull it off with real style.

What a lot of the critics have trouble with here is that it was the Brits, and not the Americans, who heisted the enigma from a Nazi sub.  I assume that that is the case.  Nonetheless, the film does not claim to be a historical drama or that the story is true.  Thus, it is just a movie and that is how it should be seen IMHO.  If you want to know the historical reality, there are plenty of books or other films for that.

2484457,2,B000E1ZK5A,"Back when Bill Paxton was coming off of some great 90's work, Matthew McConaughey was trying to be seen as a serious actor, Harvey Keitel was starring in everything and Jon Bon Jovi was trying his hand at acting, `U-571' was born.  Like so many have stated, this film looks great, it sounds great and in the end it is rather entertaining, BUT the biggest flaw is the most noticeable and the one that will forever mar this from being anything worth my time and attention.

It's stupid.

Not only is the film largely formatted for the taste of American's (who would have ever thought I'd ethically battle a Matthew McConaughey film?) but the script is obviously thrown together with the most preposterous of direction.

It's almost as if it wasn't even trying.

The sad thing with a film like this is that it is supposed to be serious and believable.  When you are dealing with a subject as strongly enrooted as WWII you need to handle with care so-to-speak.  You can't take so many liberties, and while some can be somewhat forgiven (I mean, I understand the `leaning' towards the American side of things since this is a Hollywood film made from the American point of view) they really should be.  I mean, film of this nature should at least attempt to be honest.

And what saddens me even more is that the film is reduced to a state of ridiculousness, with one impossible sequence after another.  It's one thing for a sci-fi popcorn muncher in the vein of `Armageddon' to pull out all stops in the `preposterous' side of things, for a film like that is supposed to suspend our disbelief.  It's another thing entirely when a film about a widely discussed and historically chronicled war is played with in a way that basically makes a mockery of a very serious and very controversial subject.

If you're not going to take it seriously then don't do it at all.

But, I guess the whole `starring Matthew McConaughey' should have been ample warning.

So, in the end I have to say `skip this one'.  Yes, the effects are solid and the overall tone and feel of the film is `authentic', but the film borders on insulting with its handling of the subject matter.",1270512000,,2152,4.567708333333333

I reckon theres a dedicated following for films like this and Crimson Tide. I love them, I reckon I must have been a submariner in a past life. Never been on a sub but have always had a certain kinship for them. I reckon fans of sub movies know what Im talking about. Perhaps either you have it or you dont. If you don't you might be nit picking and critical but for the fan such as myself and am sure others its always a great thrill. So you gotta ask yourself one question, 'Do you feel a kinship for subs'? If you do just get the flick and enjoy. You won't be dissapointed.

Cons:
I thought the script was terrible.  This WW2 sub film had all the typical ""sub"" plots like running silent, taking it deeper, engineers fixing leaks, and sending up an oil slick and debris field including a dead body. The unusual twists were utterly unbelievable.

The moment you decide to watch a movie you have asked to be entertained. That means you have willingly allowed yourself to escape reality a bit to enjoy yourself. In addition, if you didn't want to suspend reality watching U-571 you could have easily put on History Channel and/or Discovery to watch a black and white documentary of U-BOAT warfare. With that said the movie still captures what it was like serving on a submarine during WWII.

Now that I have that off my chest...U-571 pays homage to the courageous men who served on Submarines and U-Boats during WWI and WWII. The story is wonderful and makes you feel like you are on the submarine fearing every depth charge and pulse pounding moment. The ending is wonderful and you will cheer and feel AMERICAN PRIDE! It ranks with today's modern sub classice like Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide and K-19! Enjoy!

NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: It looks and sounds better than ever! A true DEMO DISC! It felt like I was watching it for the first time again. The movie defaults to the U-CONTROL for some reason which gives access to making of features. This can be easily turned off.

2484461,4,B000E1ZK5A,"A DeLaurentiis production, Jonathan Mostow's U-571 (2000) is a World War II adventure featuring submarines operating in the Atlantic in 1942.  With plenty of tension, and some unexpected developments, the story is a bit more involved and exciting than the average underwater mission.

German sub U-571 has been crippled in battle, and another U-boat is on the way to try and repair the craft.  The American Navy's plan is to immediately dispatch sub S-33, get to U-571 first, and attempt to capture the sub's enigma cipher machine.  With U-boats inflicting huge losses on the supply ships to Britain, and the Allies being unable to break the German codes, securing an enigma could be a decisive development.

Mathew McConaughey is Lt. Andrew Tyler, executive officer on sub S-33, who due to lack of support from his commanding officer Lt. Commander Dahlgren (Bill Paxton), has just been denied command of his own vessel.  Aboard for the mission are Intelligence officer Major Coonan (David Keith) and Lt. Hirsh (Jake Weber), who have a plan to recover the device.  Initially luck is with the Americans as they get to the crippled sub first, and take control of her.  But the German rescue U-boat is not far behind, and sends sub S-33 to the bottom with a torpedo shot.  Tyler and a small group of sailors still aboard the U-571, scramble to get the crippled U-boat underway, and somehow manage to sink the other U-boat.  With the enigma machine miraculously still aboard, the Americans begin limping toward England, facing an uncertain future.

The film has been criticized because the British, and not the Americans actually first recovered an enigma machine from a German sub.  Fair enough, but listening to his commentary track, director/writer Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown), appears to have a good general knowledge of WWII movies, and has done some research on submarine warfare in particular.  While the British were first, Americans did procure an Enigma machine later.  Few war films put realism before being entertaining, and Mostow explains much of the thinking behind what happens in the film.  U-571 is well-acted, and does not go over the top with panicking sailors.

A big fan of sub films, Mostow makes sure to include a number of the more popular submarine related clichs, stretching believability in a typically Hollywood fashion.  Since the sub is crippled, we are spared the out of control crash dive down to crush depth, where water leaks in through the hull, and bolts pop out, where the crew's eyes are glued to the depth gage, listening to someone announce the depths lower and lower.  We do however get to see U-571 take out a destroyer's communications with a deck gun, rush dive and cross underneath a ship, run silent in near darkness, survive exploding depth charges, release debris and a human body to simulate being hit, take cannon fire, restore the ability to fire at the last second, and launch their last remaining torpedo, which strikes home, sending the enemy destroyer down, in rather dated looking CGI flames.

Regarding some critics here that question the historical accuracy, it's a ""fictional"" story based loosely upon the exploits of many brave men during WWII, American and U.K., but focusing on an American submarine crew.  At the end of the film, credit is given to many (if not all) crews that captured Enigma code materials during WWII, including the U.K. crews.  Maybe these critics didn't stick with the film long enough to see credit given to the real people that this film is honoring.  If you watch the bonus features included on the DVD, you will hear from the director/writer about how the story was developed, the research that was done, and the submarine training that the cast received.  He in no way is trying to say that the events in the movie actually happened.  He just wanted to do an exciting WWII submarine movie and pay tribute to the brave men who served on submarines in WWII.  I believe he said that he wanted to create a film that would allow people to ""experience"" what the characters in the film are experiencing and ask the question ""would I be brave enough to do this?"".  In my opinion, he absolutely succeeds.

I have only seen this film on standard DVD so I can't comment on the Blu-ray version.

One additional point discussed by the director... the German submarine crew is played by an all-German cast of actors rather than a bunch of American actors speaking German.  It may seem like a minor point, but it really adds to the movie experience.

2484482,4,B000E1ZK5A,"Captain Dahlgreen (Bill Paxton), Mr. Tyler (Matthew McCougnehey), and a hard-nosed Master Chief (Harvey Keitel) lead a group of sailors aboard an American submarine during WWII.  Prior to disembarkment, they are boarded by two military intelligence officers with knowledge of a German submarine, a U-Boat, that possibly has the Enigma onboard, a powerful encryption/decryption device through which secret German messages can be intercepted and used against the enemy.

Upon locating the enemies, the plan is to forcibly board the U-Boat, grab the Enigma, and sink the enemy ship.  With any luck, the Germans will not know their device has been stolen, and the allies can take advantage of the communication breach to turn the tide in the war.

The plan is going perfectly and all German prisoners have been transferred to the U.S. vessel.  The last remaining people are making the transition from enemy ship to ally ship when an unidentified German U-Boat sneaks up on the action and fires a torpedo into the broad-side of the U.S. ship, destroying it on impact.  From there it's a cat and mouse game between the subs, as the Germans try to sink their own ship in order to save their secret.  Meanwhile, the Americans have to contend with not only the German line of ships - inconveniently between the Americans and the nearest safe-haven, England; but they're also battling a wounded, sitting-duck of a sub, and possible saboteurs in their midst.

The tense action is palpable, and there is a definite feeling of claustrophobic fear as the sailors attempt to descend before the enemies can sink them.  The dark, cold water can suck the air and life out of a person, and the men reflect that realism with every bead of sweat, every hushed voice, and every furrowed brow that acknowledges the deep, surrounding oceans.

It is Spring 1942 and the setting is the North Atlantic Ocean.

Their hopes lie in a daring operation aimed at securing the Enigma code machine, which in turn might turn the tide of the war.  It is under these circumstances that the S-33 sub sails to intercept the U-571...

Matthew McConaughey, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well.

I know that there are lots of people who have been interested in the original score to U-571 but can't seem to find it....well, that's true considering the score was never actually released. Richard Marvin is one of Hollywood's lesser-known composers but that does not make him a poor composer by any means. In fact, his work for U-571 is regarded as an excellent contribution to the submarine genre. Most submarine flicks since the 1980's have had very memorable scores (Das Boot, The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide) and Richard's own music is a welcome addition to the submarine legacy. As I mentioned earlier, it is sad that Varese Sarabande or another music producer did not release the score on CD.....but wait! Universal Songs Inc. did a promotional release of the score in 2000 just for the composer.

The characters are developed correctly in the beginning and the whole idea of stealing the Enigma which posed such a threat to the American Navy was a great story. However, the historical accuracy's end here. The resupply submarine which was sent by the US was a great idea for a movie, but when the US crew storms the wounded enemy U-boat, there would've been no chance of boarding him. The dive time for a type VIIC was approximately 25 seconds. The attack scene lasted several minutes. Point made. Other parts of the movie weren't detailed correctly either, when the enemys torpedo's ""brushed"" by Matthew McConaughey's captured U-571, they would've been dead in real life (German torpedo's used a magnetic trigger which went off when close to metal). The list goes on as you watch the movie. At the end you realize that U-571 didn't have help from anyone who knew anything about WWII sub tactics and that its simply a byproduct of a Hollywood idea gone wrong. Not to say that U-571 was a horrible movie, on the contrary its fun to watch, but for the naval critics and true war fans out there don't expect much.

Also, the SF are far off the standards  which were already achieved by ""das boot"" 20 years ago.

This movie does not transport anything like e.g. claustrophobia; of the fear being trapped in a cigar made of iron in the middle of the Atlantic. It is simply about American heroism, not about the cruelties of war.

In this movie the Americans achieve, what in reality was achieved by the Royal Navy.

This is not just another war-movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" with a fictional story in a historical setting, just another ""change of reality""-style-movie.

I do not want to know how many people run around now, truelly believing that the Americans cracked ""Enigma"".

The whole Movie is not about action, u-boats, a part of the liberation of Europe or valiant deeds in war, it's just about ""good guy"" against ""bad guy"", in a manner that is called American ""hurra patriotism"" in Europe.

2484517,5,B000E1ZK5A,"This film went under the waves fairly quickly without earning especially high marks from either critics or audiences. After watching it more than once, and enjoying it more with each viewing, I have come to the conclusion that any picture about submarines made after Das Boot is going to seem short of the mark at first blush. Wolfgang Petersen's masterwork has left such massive footprints that simply making a submarine movie becomes an act of courage.

I urge you to view this film on its own merits, which are many. It has a wonderfully tight script by Jonathan Mostow, which has many simple things to say about leadership and courage. Mostow makes his points cleanly without a lot of sugar. The characters develop in a very natural and believable way, particularly the character of Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Mathew McConaughey), who begins the film in a snit over a missed promotion and through the course of events has to mature greatly under fire. Helping him to learn about command is Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton in a refreshingly earnest performance). With a few simple lines of great dialogue, Dahlgren explains to Tyler the elements of command he has not yet understood, which leaves the young and struggling officer like a deer in the headlights. I won't quote dialogue here. It is much better to let the film speak for itself. You will recognize it when it comes. It really made me think about the character of a true leader in a new way, and I think that is the ultimate praise for a great piece of script writing.

The film-makers also took tremendous care with the technical aspects of this movie, which I greatly appreciated, being a fan of submarine films. They truly did it right from bow to stern, and their care really shows. The special effects are tremendous as well. No CGI here, as the explosions nearly jump off the screen in real-time reverberations.

Finally, the movie is full of wonderful performances with standouts being Harvey Keitel playing old salt, Chief Klough (who is also a player in teaching the young officer Tyler a thing or two about commanding a ship in the navy); and surprise of the day goes to Bon Jovi as Lieutenant Pete Emmet (yet hasn't this guy turned in enough good screen performances yet to rate being more than a ""surprise""?). I also enjoyed the performance of Jake Weber, who plays Lieutenant Hirsch. It's a shame this actor doesn't appear in more big pictures. He perfectly captures the undercurrent of discipline and quiet steel necessary to bring his Navy intelligence officer to life.

This is a powerful, satisfying film, well done in nearly every respect. I recommend it to fans of submarine warfare and anyone who enjoys an action film done in the grand, Hollywood style. -Mykal Banta",1119571200,,2766,4.829113924050633
2484518,4,B000E1ZK5A,"A lot of reviewers have been saying what can or can not be done by people on a submarine.  I wonder if any of them have ever been on one, or are even old enough to have been.

There is an interview with a retired U.S. Admiral who was on S-boat submarines in WW2 (fighting the Japanese), and then after the war took command of a german U-boat that was surrendered so they could see how the technology compared with that of the allies.  He sat there and explained that it was very easy to pilot the german sub without knowing german.  He said that they didn't even put different labels on it.  This is a hollywood movie, so there are bound to be dumb things done in it, but that was not one of them, so people need to calm down a bit.  This man was the technical consultant on the film.

It is actually really impressive, they made this movie as accurate as possible, physically building a sub for it, and designing it according to  original drawings and plans where possible.  There were actual submariners working with the actors, teaching them what buttons to push, which levers to pull, and instructing them in the correct termanology.  I was very impressed by that.

Yes, I do certaintly agree that there is no way the sub would have been able to take that much punishment, but that is hollywood, and is to be expected in almost any action movie (so stop complaining).  That is the genre.

Some complain that the sailors look like boy scouts and not soldiers.  Most enlisted personnel *were* just out of high school.  Late in the war, the average age of a captain got as low as 26.  This is accuracy, just like the boat, the levers and the uniforms.

There have been criticims leveled because it portrays an American crew when the first two captures of enigmas were made by the British, and so they dismiss it as 'propaganda' which is trying to 're-write history'.  Well, again, watch the special features (and the ending credits).  They don't deny that it was first the British, infact, they have an interview with the Lt. Commander of the Royal Navy who was the man who first boarded a U-boat and retrieved the first enigma.  It is interesting, HE didn't seem to be offended.

Remember, this is fiction.  If you watch the interviews with the writer/director, you will see that the movie really was a personal, and somewhat emotional, inquiry into just who these people were who did such amazing acts, whether they are somehow super-human, or just like everybody else.  The reason I say personal is that he spends time talking about how he wonders whether he would have been able to rise to it like all of these kids did, and concludes that while he hopes so, he doesn't know.  So, my point is this: of course it is going to be a story about Americans.  He is American, and he is trying to relate somehow, to understand in some small degree.  That is much easier when the culture is the same.  It is not American 'imperialistic propiganda' or anything else that made it an American crew - it likely just facillitated his inquiry.  (That said: there was an enigma that was captured by the us navy later on, so having an American crew is not that bad anyway)

Some people were offended that the German crew murders survivors of a wreck, and thus state that this is supposed to make us hate the Germans, wave our US flags, and be more into the film.  I could not disagree more.  What it showed is that they were human too.  They did not want to do it, and only did it on their Captain's orders, who says that it is a standing order from the Fuhrer.  Even after he gives the order they are hesitating, and looking at each other uncomfortably, and only do it after he yells again.  That humanizes the German crew, not the other way around.  Honestly, it makes them seem like victims of the war, just like all the kids in the allied military were.

I liked the movie a fair bit, but it wasn't a 5-star.  I defend it here because what people are saying about it is so unthinking and ludicrous.  I don't know, it seems like people want to be offended and are just looking for excuses.  And in that case, nothing that I say, and not truth itself, would make a difference.",1119052800,,4166,4.417322834645669

2484520,3,B000E1ZK5A,"Okay.  We've heard it already.  The history in this film is not accurate.  As I said in my review for another notoriously inaccurate film, _The Patriot_, however, it does not really matter.  If one is turning to Hollywood to receive an education in history, then naturally they will be disappointed.  Do these films help contribute to a false sense of patriotism in the public masses?  They probably do, but let us judge _U-571_ for what it is: a Hollywood picture.  It is not an historical documentary.  It is an action film that loosely takes its subject matter on submarine warfare during WWII.  Let's move on with our lives.

All that being said, _U-571_ is a standard action film--no more, no less.  It's action scenes are fairly well done, particularly the scenes in which the protagonists are being depth-charged by a German destroyer.  Matthew McConaughey gives a fairly good performance as a popular lieutenant who is forced to take over the burden of command during a secret operation that goes awry.  As a few reviewers have commented, however, I too noticed that the film failed to really pull me into the claustrophobic atmosphere of the submarine.  Something was missing from the suspense.  Even during the obligatory ""let's see how deep the sub can dive without being crushed"" scene, a real sense of danger was nevery truly established, leaving the audience wanting more in terms of nail-biting suspense.

Despite its shortcomings, if you enjoy submarine action flicks, I don't think you can go wrong with _U-571_.  While there are better submarine films out there (_Das Boot_), I've certainly seen a few that were far worse.

The U-boat itself is pretty good, mind you. It's just a shame it couldn't have been used in a better movie. One, perhaps, with some vague connection to reality. For the most part, German sailors were committed nationalists, but not usually ardent Nazis, and would be just as appalled as any sailor by the idea of shooting up lifeboats.

Other problems? Officers might drop in briefly at an enlisted men's party, but they'd never hold joint social events. Submerged submarines couldn't shoot at each other until sometime in the 1950's. No German destroyer ever operated off the Atlantic coast of the United States, or even in the mid Atlantic. And, while submarines all operate on roughly the same principles, the way they do it is sufficiently different from one country to another that an American crew trying to dive a German boat would almost certainly be killed in the process.

The action sequences are very suspenseful and the cast on the whole is very good.  Matthew McConaughey brings a staunch reluctant heroism to his role as the X0 who finds himself in charge after the death of their captain (Bill Paxton in an understated performance.

Yes, the Enigma encoding machine was taken clandestinely from a German sub, but not by Americans: it was done by British commandos. America had not committed to the war at that time.  Another anomaly was presenting the American crew as being racially desegregated when in fact, racial integration within the U.S. military didn't take place until the Vietnam War.

In the 1950s it would have been a B-movie; special effects are better now, of course, so it's a 'blockbuster'.  It barely merits one star, but the system won't allow none at all.  But that's not the point, of course.
The worrying thing is the revisionist history it contains.  We are getting used to it in Britain, but Hollywood constantly rewrites history to favour the Americans, and often at our expense.  ""The Patriot"" was disgraceful enough in attributing to 1770s British troops atrocities committed by WW2 Germans against French civilians (at Orodour), but at least Hollywood was trying to establish in blatant terms who was ""good"" (Americans) and who ""bad"" (British) for the purpose of the film.  ""U 571"" goes further than that, because it rewrites history to give credit to people who do not deserve it, and by implication to take credit from those that do.
It's the feeling that some people don't think this matters that worries me.  Imagine the outcry in the US if anyone made a film showing the Royal Marines capturing Iwo Jima and raising the British Flag.  Or how about how the British fought and won the Battle of the Bulge?

2484534,1,B000E1ZK5A,"U571 is perhaps the most absurd war film I have ever seen. Nothing about this film is believable. IT starts out with the absurd proposition that a German sub captain and crew stood by while approached by the crew of an American sub posing as another German crew. The Germans would have made radio or semaphore contact- not to mention the fact that the Germans could see the American sub and did not notice that it was American, not German. OK, it was raining, but then another German sub comes along, sees the two subs, recognizes which one is American, and torpedoes it. Apparently the other Germans were better at sub recognition.
Then a few Americans on the captured German sub take a 4 second lesson in German sub operation and proceed to destroy the other German sub- amazing! They encounter a German plane over the Atlantic. One of the American seamen orders another to shoot it down AGIANST THE ORDERS OF AN OFFICER WHO IS STANDING RIGHT THERE. The officer does nothing to this seaman. On Das Boot, the Captain almost shoots a crewman who panics. Who could believe US officers to be so easy going?
The American controlled sub approaches a German surface vessel, where the plane comes from. Once again, the Germans don't bother with radio or semaphore contact. The American man their deck gun while the Germans sit idly by, and get their radio shot out. Apparently German warships only had 1 radio during WW2, because now they cannot tell that one of their subs has been captured. If that is not all idiotic enough, remember that this has to be some time in 1943- what is a German cruiser doing out in the Atlantic in broad daylight that late in the war?
A German prisoner overpowers one of the Americans on 571 and gets his 45. Another superhuman American charges him, gets shot, but keeps on going and gets the German. Isn't it funny how Germans drop when shot but Americans keep right on going? Earlier in the film, when the Americans board U571, most of the Germans hide in the engine room and cower when the Americans enter. Fact is that the German U Boat crews were chosen for their nerve. Theirs was the most elite service in German military of WW2, but in this movie they are mostly spineless cowards.
I did not see the rest of this film, because it was just getting too stupid to be entertaining. One might point out that this in not a historical documentary, its supposed to be entertaining, but how can something so blatantly idiotic be entertaining? This film is worse than Holywood propaganda films during the war. Not only does it portray the enemy as incompetent idiots or cowards and the Americans as superheroes, it has numerous historical inaccuracies. War films do not have to be 100% accurate, but they cannot be completely unbelievable and still be entertaining. This film should have been made as a spoof or not at all.

2484535,1,B000E1ZK5A,"Firstly, I should like to pay tribute to the crew of HMS Bulldog, the British Navy vessel who actually did perform the heroic deeds portrayed in this insulting film. When Enigma really was captured, America hadn't even been forced into the war yet. Britain and her allies, on the other hand, had been fighting since the summer of 1939. I find it worrying when history is revised in this way. It happened with Pearl Harbour, Saving Private Ryan and The Patriot too. When and where does Hollywood/America stop? Your own history is sufficiently full of stirring deeds to make this theft of heroism unnecessary. In answer to those who have stated that us 'Limeys' need to lighten-up and the film is purely entertainment, I feel I have to disagree. It's naive to adopt this POV when one realises the well-documented effect of Cinema on society. Great Britain and a few staunch allies stood alone for almost 3 years before the Japanese attack on Pearl forced the US into the war. We too, fought on more than one front. North Africa and the Far East, for the benefit of the earlier critic who mentioned that the US Navy was fighting in two oceans as opposed to only one. As for the tiny sop at the end of the credits, well I ask you, who reads the credits? The damage has already been done. So, what comes next, one wonders? America triumphs at El Alamein?

2484537,4,B000E1ZK5A,"I have followed Submarine movies since my childhood. I was always fascinated with what it would be like to be aboard one. I even went inside a German U-boat at a museum. I have been aboard ships, which although not as cramped they still give you a bit of the feel of what a sailors life is like. I have seen great sub movies like ""Das Boot"" and ""The Enemy Below"". Fans of the movie ""Breakdown"" will find that the same author/director did a fine job on this fictional submarine movie as well. U-571 is not meant to be a historically accurate telling of the Enigma story. It was meant to be entertaining fiction and nothing more. In that respect it is pretty good, in fact borderline great. It has plenty of tense moments and a fast pace to keep the interest of most fans of WWII movies. Like many war movies it is not the exact truth of what really happened, but it is dedicated in honor of Allied sailors. The Allied forces wanted to get their hands on an Enigma device during the war. It saddens me that so many vote negative, not because they think badly of our reviews so much as they don't like us enjoying a movie about Americans winning in a fictional WWII story. Is this jealousy voting?

The true story is the British ships HMS Bulldog and HMS Aubretia captured an enigma device from a German U-Boat, U-110, on May 9, 1941. The German sub failed to sink because in their rush to abandon ship they forgot to blow the tanks. The British went aboard and found the Enigma and coding documents. Even then the Brits had to work hard at the code for some time since the Germans wised up to so many of their subs being sunk. The Germans added a another wheel to the Enigma device making the code far more complex with more possible variations. The British at Bletcheley Park again worked around the clock. They even came up with the first computer and successfully cracked the code. Be sure to catch the movie ""Enigma"" if this interests you. U-571 pays tribute to the Allied forces that risked their lives to capture Enigma devices and documents. There never was a mission like this movie indicates during WWII and especially not with any Americans involved. I still like this movie as entertainment, and I appreciate it being  dedicated to Allied sailors. People that enjoy the vast majority of WWII movies will probably find this movie worthwhile, and I would even venture to say that it has replayability.

2484546,4,B000E1ZK5A,"In ""U-571"", an untested USN officer named Tyler (Mcaunaghey) leads the green crew of an obsolete USN submarine on a daring, top-sectret mission of modern piracy against a crippled Nazi U-Boat. It's 1942, dark days for the allies everywhere, and especially in the battle of the north Atlantic. Freighters steal across the Atlantic in convoys, desperate to get their needed cargo to Europe to shore up the western front against Germany.  German sailors in U-boats hunt the convoys down in organized wolfpacks.  In a desperate battle for both sides, the Germans lost about 30,000 men, but came close to cutting the Atlantic off.  In the beginning of the flick, allied intelligence picks up the U-571's distress call, the having barely survived a crushing depth charge attack.  Quickly realizing they've got a chance to grab the sub and its sensitive equipment intact, Washington hits upon a plan of modern-day piracy.  They commandeer a tired ""S-Boat"" - an American submarine already obsolete before WWII - to rendezvous with U-571 under the disguise of rescuing German sub. The S-boat's inadequacies are painful, but her small size makes her a convincing stand-in for U-571's sister ship.  Washington cares less about U-571 than its ""Enigma"" - an early generation of calculator used by the Kriegsmarine to decode/encode messages to and from its warships. By capturing an Enigma, the allies hope to break the German codes and learn to navigate its ships around the Nazi subs which, stealth aside, are slow and very vulnerable. Fooling the Germans at first, the initial operation comes off flawlessly - and our boys capture both Nazi-sub and enigma in one of those otherwise bloodless operations we've seen in countless war movies. But that's only a set-up for when the plan goes bad: U-571's actual sister-sub appears, torpedoes and all, and U-571 becomes the kind of movie we haven't seen that much of. With their own sub sent to the bottom, Tyler and the rest of his crew must save U-571, learn the secret of driving the foreign sub and sail her across the Atlantic. Tyler is a whiz at subs, but he's unproven. Instead, he relies on Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel) to explain what ""Sub School"" could not. After narrowly defeating U-571's sister-sub, Tyler and his crew settle on the slightly less impossible of two plans - sail for England, getting as close as possible without being sighted...by anybody. (Should the Germans learn of U-571's capture, they will certainly modify both Enigmas and their codes, and Tyler's efforts will have been in vain.) Discovery is less likely in an eastward course, even though it means braving waters swimming with U-boats. By the end of the flick, Tyler will have barely survived a game of ""cat and mouse"" with a German destroyer, and a near Mutiny with his own crew.
This flick took a lot of lumps for realism stretches, though most deserve qualification. The film entirely omits any mention of England's recovery of an Enigma machine in 1941, years before we Yanks. Simply ignoring history is bad, but it doesn't make the story as implausible as ""U-571""'s many British critics would insist.  Given how tight-lipped the British were on any subject connected to their ability to read German codes, it's entirely possible that too few American planners in '42 would have known enough about England's possession of Enigma to declare Tyler's mission unnecessary (England declined to declassify their work on Enigma after the war's end, keeping the wraps on until the early 1970's). A cursory mention of England's seizure of Enigma does not otherwise correct the historical flaws of the film (the story is still inexplicably bereft of any British characters, and it would have taken little to actually add some to the script).  On the flip side, a painfully accurate story obviates a more stinging barb on the Brits - one that both acknowledges that they got Enigma first, but also that they kept their exploits silent even knowing that their allies would risk their own men on near suicidal missions to nab what the British already had.  (Can you imagine the howls had ""U-571"" ended with our heroes turning over their hard-won prize to the RN...only for it to join hordes of similar machines silently amassed by the allies, blind, deaf and dumb to the sacrifices of Tyler's men?)  The subject of England's stinginess with anything relating to German cryptography, at the cost of American lives, is discussed overtly in Robert Harris's great novel ""Enigma"", a novel which Has not been criticized for historical inaccuracy. Further, while critics here think this is another attempt at Hollywood revisionism, it's easy to point out that Hollywood holds no monopoly in that area, as anybody who's ever seen ""Breaking the Sound Barrier"" can attest - in which we learn that the first man to fly faster than sound was actually a British Pilot flying a DeHavilland fighter.  While ""Breaking"" boldly claimed for England credit for the first manned supersonic flight, 'U-571' at least had the decency to set its story a year after the Brits Enigma recovery.
Taking an unrealistic premise - Tyler and his crew assimilating the incredibly complicated and undeniably foreign ship - ""U-571"" works in a very realistic way, with the script showing how quick thinking and not a small amount of luck saved the day, and how narrowly Tyler and crew beat the odds. The cinematography goes even further, letting us know that, contrary to what we've seen in ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""Destination Tokyo"", Submarines were cramped and dark, leaked water, were very slow, groaned under the pressure of the water above and, when surfaced, dipped and climbed on waves like a tin can. This is probably the only flick since ""Das Boot"" to convey just how impossible a job it was to fight in subs in WWII. It's no ""Das Boot"", but ""U-571"" now makes it impossible to watch any of those quaint and propaganda-laden movies made during the war.",1046304000,,5939,4.9528112449799195
2484547,4,B000E1ZK5A,"U-571 is good movie with plenty of action and excitement.  However, as a quasi-historical story it comes up seriously short in the accuracy department.  The movie takes a real event and re-casts it with an American flavor.
The simple fact is that U-571 depicts Americans capturing a German Enigma coding machine to break Nazi communications. The feat was actually accomplished by the British in 1941 -- before the United States entered World War II.
Hollywood's revisionist bent is nothing new.  Other recent movies such as Saving Private Ryan and The Patriot have sent historians running for the asprin bottle.  What concerns me most is the showing parts or all of this movie in school classrooms as a substitute for real history.",1044662400,,731,5.016528925619835
2484548,5,B000E1ZK5A,"This is a wonderful movie which highlights the leadership growth of a young naval officer suddenly thrust into command under incredibly challenging circumstances.  Originally evaluated by his captain as ""not ready"" for command, Lt. Tyler is faced with a striking array of challenges.
This is a story, primarily, of leadership at sea.  We often forget that our fighting men are often asked to do the nearly impossible, as portrayed in this movie. I have seen just about every submarine movie around, and in my opinion this one compares favorably with ""The Enemy Below,"" ""Das Boot,"" ""Run Silent Run Deep"" and other greats.  It is far more watchable than ""Das Boot""--U-571 does not have any of the dull, draggy interludes that punctuate ""Das Boot"" (and most other European movies).  The storyline is brisk, the acting is crisp and authentic, and the story grabs you from the very first moments.  This is a great movie.
This movie has wonderful sound effects.  The visuals are utterly real--the viewer feels transported into an old WW2 vintage submarine, and from this realizes an appreciation for the heroism of the men who fought a war inside these steel tin cans.
Some of our European friends are bitter because this story is about the US Navy mounting a mission to capture a German enigma machine.  While it is true that the Brits did more of this than did America (after all, they were in the war longer, and the US Navy had to fight two wars at once) it is also true that the US Navy did capture an enigma machine during the war, through heroism and competence.  There is nothing amiss here by virtue of the movie being about Americans.
Put aside your prejudices and enjoy this movie!  It is a story of leadership and bravery, not just a ""shoot-em-up.""  Watching Lt. Tyler mature into a superb submarine skipper and gain the respect of his crew is really what this story is about--and a great story it is.",1042848000,,1907,4.716867469879518
2484549,4,B000E1ZK5A,"This film is so suspenseful, you could almost throw your nail clippers away and just watch U-571!  Granted, our friends in Great Britain are rightly peeved to see what is labeled as based on a true story to have the glaring error that it was the USA rather than Britain who actually performed the capture of the Enigma machine.
However, with that kept in mind, Jonathan Mostow does a great job of creating suspense with screenplay and direction.  His last film ""Breakdown"" was a tight suspense flick with Kurt Russell trying to find his kidnapped wife.  I saw this after seeing ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" and enjoyed this one much more.
Johnny Johnson who did the sound for ""A Knight's Tale"" has created a great wall of sound effect that has buzzers and blasts going off, creating a great sonic setting that enhances the picture.
Matthew McConaughey as Lt. Andrew Tyler does a good job of showing the somewhat green commander coming into his own and able to make life & death decisions when necessary.  Bill Paxton's voice acted as a sedative for me because he was SO calm.  Harvey Keitel as Chief Klough does an excellent job.  One scene where he counsels Tyler that a captain must show his crew that he ALWAYS knows, even when he doesn't, to ensure confidence and cooperation is particularly effective.  Jon Bon Jovi as Lt. Pete Emmett does a good job.  I also liked the skitterish Trigger played by Tom Guiry who eventually drowns while trying to repair the torpedo, the crew's only chance of survival.  After appearances in Black Hawk Down & Tigerland, he's becoming a war flick fixture.
So while the British are understandably cool to the flick, it does wind the mechanism of suspense to the breaking point.  The special effects of explosions are also excellent.  This is a great evening's entertainment.  Enjoy!",1041465600,,1813,4.7756410256410255

2484551,5,B000E1ZK5A,"U-571 follows a fictional crew of submariners who attempt to steal a German Enigma encoding machine from one of their U-Boats. The movie is led by an all-star cast including Bill Paxton as Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren, Matthew McConaughey, who does an excellent job as X.O. Andy Tyler, Harvey Keitel as the rough and tough Chief Klough, and Jon Bon Jovi as Tyler's Annapolis buddy Lt. Pete Emmitt.  The group is on a 48 hour pass when they are interrupted and told of a crippled German U-Boat that is adrift in the North Atlantic.  A plan is devised to send in an American submarine disguised as a German U-Boat, board the enemy submarine, and steal the Enigma machine, which was used for encoding secret messages. The plan works well at the beginning, as the group is able to board the enemy submarine, but disaster soon follows as a real German submarine sent to repair the crippled one appears on the scene and fires a torpedo at the disguised American boat.  Tyler, Chief Klough, Emmitt, and the other survivors are forced to board the crippled sub to escape.  What happens next is a thrilling battle of wits between the Germans and Americans as the group attempts to escape with the Enigma while the Germans try to sink them.
The battle scenes, especially the depth charge attacks, are first-rate and very realistic.  You can almost feel yourself shaking along with the crew as the depth charges move ever closer to the sub.  Matthew McConaughey is outstanding in his role as Tyler as he tries to outwit the enemy and bring his crew to safety.
I am a big fan of submarine movies, including Crimson Tide and The Hunt for Red October, and U-571 deserves a place alongside these other fine films. I also thought the producers of the film did a nice job of including the names of actual World War II German submarines that were actually boarded and had their Enigma machines taken by the Allies at the end of the movie.  If you enjoy submarine movies, then you will surely enjoy U-571.

The pace of the film, the suspense is just right. I'm a fan of submarine/u-boat movies.  This ranks up there with Das Boat, Hunt for Red October, and Crimson Tide.
It is a no-nonsense action film. There is very, very little fluff. Unlike films like Top Gun (which I can watch in 25 minuts after FF by the chick flick stuff), it is all action.

2484559,3,B000E1ZK5A,"The plot keys off an attempt by the allies to capture the enigma, the code name for the German encryption device used for communications between navel vessels.
The Americans became aware of a disabled U-Boat out in the Atlantic.  They built a submarine that looked like a German U-Boat.  They plan on sailing up to the German boat pretending to be another U-Boat coming to their aid.  The plan is to dispatch or capture the occupants, grab the enigma device and scuttle the boat. The Americans on the mission have been told that winning the war depends on capturing an enigma device, without the Germans knowing.  If the Germans know an enigma device has been captured, they will change the codes.
While scuttling the German boat, its torpedoes accidentally fire and sink the American one.  The surviving Americans and their prisoners must occupy the crippled German sub and sail safely to the allies.  It is at this point when the best action scenes take place.  The combat scenes between the American-occupied U-Boat and a German naval Vessel they encounter are very thrilling.  On the U-Boat, there are several gruesome hand-to-hand combat scenes between the Americans and their German prisoners.
Like most action movies, this one stretches credibility like a rubber band.  It stretches the rubber band to the breaking point to make me think that an already disabled U-Boat, after an attempt at being scuttled, is still able to submerge and function
In most war movies, U-Boats are portrayed as attacking other military vessels.  In reality, the job of the U-Boats was to attack commercial ships, to cut off allied supplies.  Rarely did they go against armed military vessels.
In U-571, there is an isolated scene where a U-Boat comes across a boat full of allied sailors adrift at sea.  The Germans machine-gun them all.  In reality, the U-Boats were under orders not to take on survivors because they didn't have the space, but it was not the norm at all to shoot survivors.  In fact, there were many instances of U-Boat crews giving provisions and providing directions to allied sailors adrift in lifeboats.  Their job was not to kill people but to sink allied freight.
There was one human drama of interest in the movie, but it was not explored fully.  The executive officer of the Americans was a man who had just been passed over in an appointment to captain a ship.  When he confronted his superior as to why, he was told that he wasn't ready. His superior told him he must learn that in making decisions, he must take into consideration the lives of the men under him.  When the captain of the submarine dies, this executive officer is now in charge.  The drama that occurs is that he is unsure what to do about anything.  Harvey Keitel counsels him that for the sake of the sailors, a commander must always know what to do, even when he doesn't.  The rookie commander comes into his own as the drama nears conclusion, but he achieves victory at a great cost in the human life of his own crew.  Remember, on both sides, the sailors were mostly in their late teens and their immediate officers were in their twenties.  A captain in his thirties was an old man.
War movies have evolved so that there are certain arch-typical characters we've all come to expect.  U-571 gives at least a half-hearted nod to the tradition.  Harvey Keitel, plays the role of the old sea dog, a World War I submarine veteran, who respectfully, but forcefully, gives advice to the green commander.  Another actor plays the young German American who is assigned to the crew because he speaks fluent German.  The original captain selflessly waves off his executive officer as he drowns at sea.  Other than that, there is little to differentiate most of the characters from one another.  Most of the Germans look like most of the Americans.
I've never been favorably disposed towards action-adventure films.  This one is entertaining but definitely not one of the year's best.
For a more authentic U-Boat movie, I suggest you go to the foreign movie section of your video store and checkout, Das Boot.  It is a German-made movie about a U-Boat and crew being depth-charged by the Americans.  It is a classic, and it is very gripping.",1026604800,,4217,4.765840220385675

2484568,4,B000E1ZK5A,"Sometimes a movie is able to rise above it's trite and oft told storyline. The one used for U-571, which is about submarine warfare in W.W.II, can be summed up as follows: sub meets sub, sub loses sub, sub gets sub. Fortunately, in the hands of director Jonathan Mostow and his crew, U-571 has been crafted into a tight little thriller which should have most viewers on the edge of their seats. I should add that it is not recommended for anyone who is more than mildly claustrophobic.
The story is a blend of several true events, although in real life, most of the heroes were British, not American. German submarines were equipped with a radio device called Enigma, which was able to transmit coded information that only the Germans could translate. Without the device itself, the Allied Forces had a very hard time of tracking the U-boats. These were devastatingly effective in sinking our ships.
A fancy wedding reception for an American Naval officer is interrupted by military police bearing the news that leave has been cut short for the men of one sub. Navy brass has learned that a German U-boat has been disabled in the Atlantic and is awaiting a repair sub. The plan is simple. The Americans will use a sub outfitted to look like a Nazi one. They will attempt to reach the German sub before the Nazi rescue vessel does. They will then board the enemy vessel and seize the Enigma. After taking the Germans prisoner, they will sink their U-boat. The Germans will then have no way of knowing that the device has been captured. Like most simple plans, this one quickly gets very complicated. It also gets extremely dangerous.
Jonathan Mostow uses some effective tricks to make U-571 rise above its script. From the opening shots, which show how the German ship was crippled in battle, he manages to keep the movie's tension level very high. The American sub is an old one. It creaks constantly. There is water always dripping from its old pipe joints. These effects work well, because they convince us landlubbers that this thing would be unsafe to be in during peacetime, much less during a war. So, we have already been set up before the first enemy torpedo races towards our heroes, trapped as they are in this unnatural craft. Later, there are the depth charges. The crew can't see them, but they can hear them. They get louder and louder as a Nazi destroyer gets closer and closer. It all turns into a suspenseful game of cat and mouse, and the tension level is raised even higher as everything about the mission goes dreadfully wrong halfway through the movie. .
While this film is filled with great actors, there is not much to be said for this cast, simply because the characters are subordinate to the special effects. This is appropriate for this kind of movie, where too much character development tends to get in the way of the action. If you think about it, a thriller, by its very nature, doesn't work if there are lulls in the story. In U-571, there are hardly any.",1016409600,,2987,4.637735849056604

During the Second World War the Germans used a machine to generate their codes. The machine was called Enigma. The British had purchased a copy of one of these machines from some Polish agents early in the war. The film is based on an incident in which a British trawler forced a German U Boat to surrender. They were able to capture the German book of settings for the machine and also some of the rotor wheels.
This break through was of importance as it enabled the British to dimply direct convoys around the German boats. (The German boats gave position reports to their high command on a regular basis) It significantly cut down the losses of merchant boats for a while.
British viewers are no doubt annoyed that this exploit of a trawler captain has become a special covert operation run by the Americans. Other viewers will be annoyed by the complete failure to look at anything to do with how U Boats actually operated at the time. In recent years submarines have had torpedoes which have homing devices and as a result torpedoes can be fired at submerged submarines. In the Second World War this simply was not possible. To have combat occur in a way which was impossible grates.

I was aware the film was only loosely based on these events but I as I watched I realised that any enjoyment I would have got from the film was totally ruined by the building resentment that Hollywood had totally rewritten the story to give its core audience (the American public) home grown heroes to cheer. Nothing wrong with that you might think - but why not choose any one of the many heroic feats of arms performed by the USN - esp in the Pacific Theater - where there would not be the need to take credit away from some very brave men and there would also be the opportunity to educate the public about the real sacrifices made on our behalf 60 years ago.
To those who think I am being over defensive - firstly  I think, as a matter of principle, historical revisionism is dangerous and should be exposed when encountered and secondly just imagine the reaction if a British film came out detailing the capture of Iwo Jima by British Royal Marines or one showing an outnumbered  Royal Navy carrier force inflicting grievious losses on the Japanese at Midway....",1010966400,,1350,4.461538461538462

My only real complaint is that the film gives credit to the theatrically heroic Americans for recovering a German Enigma machine for decoding orders sent to their submarines. This was something that the British had actually accomplished and should be given credit for. The United States did not recover an Enigma machine till near the end of the war.

Pure common sense is affronted in many scenes as are historical facts(a few men man a submarine in an altogether impossible attack?a german destroyer and figther plane in the North Atlantic in 1942?Give me a break!)
This film is a simple action movie in the way a 007 James Bond film is. If Hollywood wanted to make a film about the U.S submarine force in WWII it could have chosen many good stories from the Pacific theatre,like the one about the USS Wahoo.

Interesting that some feel compelled to diss this movie based on historical inaccuracy because the British found the enigma.  Since when did this movie claim to be historically correct?  It's not Blackhawk Down, people.  Also, I see a lot of the requisite snobbery from critics who think they are on the Academy Awards Committee and feel compelled to state the oldest complaint in the book: ""lack of character development.""
Look, there's only so much dinner with wife and kids that I can handle in a movie.  I easily identified with the characters, and anyone who wasn't completely rooting for Matthew McConaughey to pull this off probably has an insecurity complex her/himself.  And when the German sub captain tried the morse code and was discovered?  Talk about gut wrenching.  ""Lack of character development?""  Oh please, at least be more original than that.
The criticism of the lone black submariner is without merit.  Very often on a World War 2 submarine, there were ""token"" blacks.  This was not unusual.  Trust me, this movie was not trying to make any political statement.  It was meant to be an action movie that honored submariners, and it did it so with class and distinction.  It was incredibly suspenseful, with excellent use of submarine language without spelling it all out, and good use of sound and cinematography in particular.  The chief did an excellent job, too.
I laughed at the criticism of Paxson as being too stoic a commander.  How many naval vessel captains are gung-ho lunatics?  Yea, like I'd want that in a commander.  Trust me, if they were, they'd never reach captain.
If you are a history buff or are from England and get all defensive that the British captured the enigma, then don't watch this.  It will make you go into a tizzy.

Outstanding and gripping and action packed story, great script, great cinematography, fantastic performances (even by unknowns), fantastic sets, great Director's Commentary - Jonathan Mostow, (with additional cast and producer interviews), all star cast (see editors review above), great music... it just keeps going.
If you want a good solid war movie full of heroes giving their lives for the greater cause, this is it!  And, if you are not a war movie fan.... it doesn't have the gruesome scenes that plague most war movies.
Story:
Early in WWII the US lost 25% of its merchant marine fleet (cargo ships) right off the Atlantic Coast.  Nazi subs crushed the US efforts to support the European theater with war materials.  A Nazi sub is disabled and floating in the middle of the Atlantic and it becomes a race against time to get the sub and its ""enigma machine"" - the coding device used to send undecipherable messages.  Because of the allied shipping losses, the enigma machine is more valuable than the crew sent to collect it.  Matthew McConaughey, has to confront his own weaknesses as he becomes skipper of the disabled sub when his American sub is sunk, killing his skipper ( Bill Paxton) and its crew.  McConaughey is left with a handful of crew members, and a captured German crewman.
The story brings to life the reality and pain of decisions that must be made for the ""greater good"" during war, and unusual circumstances.
Really everything in the movie and the DVD was great, making this a very exceptional DVD movie.

While the start is a bit slow, the prelude to the mission helps us understand the characters a little bit more deeply. Once the boys are out on the boat, action, suspense, and drama all work in great balance. Some of the overdone war boat movie plot twists are evident--dying in the engine room, an escaped prisoner eliminating his guard, and so on. Those scenes are subtly executed and well-acted, so they feel comfortable rather than tedious.
Jon Bon Jovi and ER's Dr. Melucci both put in surprisingly dynamic performances.
While the plot resolution is a little bit hard to believe, it does the subject matter justice. War itself is hard to believe, and the heroes who fought for us are of incredible mettle.
The picture is outstanding. There are lots of dark and gloomy submarine scenes, but they're very vivid with great contrast. The sound is to die for; the DTS soundtrack just smashes all the battle and explosive sounds, and the great mixing and production effort doesn't mask dialog or ambience.

2484587,3,B000E1ZK5A,"Okay, let's get the other people's nitpicks out of the way before adding my own:
Yes, the writers should not have had the American heroes capture an Enigma machine, since we all know the British did.  They should have named it something else -- or had that part of the mission fail; a good war movie is the getting back alive, you don't have to win the whole war singlehanded.  But the Enigma machine is only a McGuffin here, get over it.
Bill Paxton wooden?  On the contrary, I thought his performance was the most believable; talk to a real ship captain sometime.
Not ""Das Boot?""  No, it ain't.  But it's not trying to be.  It's just trying to be a historical swashbuckler.  If we still made twenty war movies a year, it would be more obvious that there are subgenres, from ""war is hell"" serious movies like ""Das Boot"" to adventures in a war setting like the ""Guns of Navarone"" or ""U-571.""
I didn't notice any screamingly obvious submarine tech errors -- but then, maybe I wouldn't.  In a swashbuckler, the credibility level doesn't have to be quite so high, anyway.  The two things that kept this movie from getting above 3.5 stars in my book are:
A. Somehow it does fail to get us very involved with the characters.  The character writing is skimpy, the acting doesn't grab.  Our hero is given one (schematic, all-spelled-out) inner conflict to deal with, and that's all there is to him.  Harvey Keitel (whom I always consider overrated, but who occasionally proves me wrong, as here), manages to register his character as a human, but nothing comes of it.  T.C. Carson plays his part well, but the way it's written (see B) just hurts the movie.  The plot is involving enough to entertain, but it would have been much better with characters we cared about.
B. Okay, I wouldn't nitpick every little technical point, but I hate big fat anachronisms of speech that keep dragging us back to the 1990s or 2000s.  Doesn't anybody in Hollywood have an ear for how people spoke in the 1940s?  Early on, when our hero calls a stranger ""Mack,"" I thought, okay, they're making an effort.  But immediately afterward, there's a macho confrontation ending ""If you have a problem, talk to X""--sorry, in the '40s this hadn't yet gotten shortened down from ""If you have a problem with that,"" and even the long version wasn't the most likely way you'd say it.  ""If you have a beef with me"" is only one of a dozen more authentic ways they could have written it, if they'd just gotten their speech into period.  It gets worse.  I swear I heard someone yell ""Incoming"" at one point -- Viet Nam, yes, World War II, no.  And the cliche ""lock and load"" as the big finish to a boarding party peptalk!  The phrase was ""load and lock"" during World War II, and it was a practical reminder to people loading M1 Garands, not the Tommy guns used here -- it wasn't an all-purpose American version of ""Banzai;"" using it that way, as they do here, drags us out of our '40s sub and into some '90s corporate boardroom.
And finally, there are the awful lines given to the black ship's steward, played by T.C. Carson.  Now, again, this is just meant to be an audience-pleasing swashbuckler, and no audience wants to wallow in the worst aspects of the old segregated armed forces.  We'd all rather see a black steward getting his chance to be a real fighting sailor due to an emergency -- and there's no reason why it couldn't have happened; no doubt it sometimes did.  So why ruin it by making it unbelievable? -- by giving the steward, from the earliest scenes of the picture, a free-and-easy '90s outspokenness with the officers that even white enlisted men wouldn't have attempted in those days?  It kills the character's credibility, making him as much of a drag, in a way, as a completely subservient steward staying in ""his place"" all the time would have been.
Sometimes a good plot requires bending the crediblity of technical details -- but you can *always* get the language right, it costs nothing!  Watch a few dozen old movies for the slang, read five or six of the scores of good novels written by real '40s submariners, develop an ear.  For a writer dealing with '40s characters, these should be the basics, the minimum.  Nobody made an effort here.  Okay, a lot of the contemporary audience has absolutely no feel for the past, and would consider my nitpicks the pickiest and most pointless of all; I understand, that's why I'd go as high as 3 1/2 stars.
Personally, I think a historical thriller is much more fun if it really feels like the past, and not like a bunch of our immediate contemporaries dressed up in funny clothes.
Anyway, the DVD looks great, sounds great, the story is exciting; don't take it too seriously, and you'll have a good time.  But it wouldn't have been hard to make it a lot better.",999388800,,4790,4.554259043173862

During the sinking of the allied sub, you could tell the actors were in a tank on some studio lot. In fact, the tank didn't even look like it was deep enough. Some of the characters were literraly squatting on the bottom of the tank so it would look like they were drowning.
The story alomost made sense. It was, in fact, the British who originally captured Enigma, not the Americans. And the Brits didn't get the machine off a captured sub, either.
The part that really, really, bugged me about the movie was the ending. (I won't give it away, but for those of you who have seen this movie) it seemed rather lazy to me. I wanted the dierctor to spend a few extra bucks and expand on the ending.

The real problem with this film that it seems to be one of a seemingly endless speil of ""movies"" that all have the same simplistic plot, the same characters, the same action, the same ending and for chrissakes Hollywood it is getting BORING! I can't believe that people still spend millions at the cinema to watch the same old blockbuster tripe that is trawled out every summer! I was disappointed to see U571 in this category, especially as it was directed by Jonathan Mostow, who also did the excellent ""Breakdown"". I don't have a problem with historical inaccuracies but I do find it disturbing when these films are linked to real events. Why even mention engima at all? Why not just write an entirely fictional account? I know it's fiction but after having a massive argument in a chatroom about the ""historical epic"" the ""Patriot"", I now know that there are a frightening amount of stupid people (mostly American) who actually believe that these films portray the real events. Even more disturbing is the way that the films cover up anything that might be detrimental to how the world views America. There was a black guy along for the ride so that we all know America was not a racist, segregated country in the 40's. I'm surprised there wasn't a token woman on board so that one of the crew would have somebody to shag at the end of the movie. I couldn't have given a rat's about any of the one-dimensional characters. We were never properly introduced to any of them so we never cared when any of them died or had to prove themselves. The U571 crew, naturally, were all portrayed as ruthless, evil murderers with the subtlety of an A-bomb. And there was me thinking they were just ordinary people with families fighting for their country as well. Silly me. Watching Das Boot, I sweated with those guys and I was cursing the allies for bombing them in the Straits of Gibraltar. That is what a good film truly does to you. It makes you care, not laugh. And I liked the way the Yanks made a heroic comment about not firing until fired upon just so that we'd know they were the good guys - and then proceeding to machine-gun everything that moved. (Can you use a machine gun in a sub? Won't it ricochet everywhere?) Finally, it is about time that directors woke up to the fact that big explosions do not make a good film - especially when the cinema is all laughing hysterically at the dialogue that is being spoken. I'm amazed such a number of good actors went along with this, still I guess they have mortgages to pay. In the end the only reason I can think of for watching this is the large amount of good-looking men in it.

U571, although not historically correct at times, does an above average job in recreating submarine warfare, in a way where its audience can basically understand the plot. The submarine, destroyer and uniforms added authenticity to the film as did the vocabulary and choice of cast members.

2484595,2,B000E1ZK5A,"The cracking of the enigma code played an integral part of the allied war effort of World War II.  The Germans had developed and nearly perfected a code machine capable of sending accurate messages swiftly without fear of interception due to it's complexities.  It was important for the allies to not only get their hands on an enigma code machine but to decipher its ever-changing code.
U-571 builds its premise around this exciting and disturbing event but the film, itself, is anything but exciting.  It merely attempts to ride on the coattails of other submarine films such as The Hunt For Red October and Das Boot, including all of the suspense devices that it can squeeze into its 2 hours.
Matthew McConaughey plays Lt. Tyler, an ambitious young marine officer wanting his own naval commission.  'I don't think so' says his Captain (portrayed woodenly by Bill Paxton).  Apparently Tyler would not be capable of making the tough decisions, risking lives for the mission or the greater cause.  Disappointed, Tyler wonders what his next mission will be, succumbed to the thought that he will forever be a submarine's second in command.
But this is WWII and his next mission is revealed quickly - to disguise their US submarine as a German submarine, find another German submarine stranded somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic, pretend to be Germans, board the real German submarine, steal their enigma machine and get out of sight before the real Germans arrive.  But the catch is to ensure that the Germans remain completely unaware that the enigma machine is gone.  Otherwise, the Germans will abandon its use.
Through a course of events including submarines catching on fire, going far beneath its depth capabilities, and continuous carpet bombings, Tyler is forcibly given his own command.  Will he have what it takes to be a submarine captain?  Will he be able to risk lives for the sake of the greater cause?
More bombs, more fires, more plummeting submarines and - yes - an opportunity to send a man to his death are soon to follow without surprise.  As an audience, we are asked to feel for the officers who are risking life and limb for truth, justice, and the American way.  It is an almost impossible feat with U-571 as the characters are simply used as plot devices for the film.  If the producers wanted to reach the success of Red October or Das Boot, they should have realised that it is the boat that is the plot device and it is the characters that provide the story - not the other way around.
The film fails as it is simply bland and unoriginal in its character development, or lack thereof, and its action sequences.  But more importantly, and more shamelessly, is that it rewrites history without embarrassment or concern.  Although it mentions in its end credits that this was a work of fiction, it still gives the impression that these events at least bordered on accuracy.
The enigma machine did exist and was captured by the British forces.  The British were also able to board a submarine and steal an enigma code book.  And the British were eventually able to crack the enigma code.  Certainly, these events could be made into an exciting film, not just one which is merely watchable.",994291200,,3217,4.776173285198556

But when look at from a historical point of view, its inaccuracies and misrepresentations are sky high. Not two minutes of the film can pass without sign of hollywoods ignorance of the events that took place in the race to capture the enigma code machine. Even someone with little historical knowledge can identify innacurracies through nothing more than common sense. It is shocking that the writer and director of the film can portray the events with such imprecise detail and show such disrespect to the men who lost their lives in these events of WWI.  This film would be good if more historical research was attempted. I rate it 4 out of ten.",993340800,,732,4.7637795275590555
2484599,1,B000E1ZK5A,"As bad movies go U-571 tops the charts. A American Submarine crew has to find a way to board and overtake a German U-boat, and bring back a crucial secret-code transmitter. It turns out to be more difficult than they expect. Agreeably old-fashioned WW2 submarine drama starts with a bang and but holds little interest throughout, then fizzling out at the end.  The film has no historical facts in it and has been described by many as an outrage, as it simply steals the true hero's glory.
We are introduced to Captain Andrew Tyler, who has just found out that he did not receive the position of captain as he had hoped. His commander, Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren, feels he does not have what it takes to be a captain at this point, and that his emotional connection to his shipmates would prevent him from putting them in situations of potential danger.
Soon, our men are on their sub, heading out to sea, where they encounter the German submarine, take the crew hostage, and swipe the Enigma and code book to bring back to the attention of the U.S. Armed Forces. However, the German sub that responded to their call for help destroys the American sub, killing the German hostages and some Americans, leaving the rest of the crew on the German sub with Tyler as their captain. As their special ops mission turns into a race for survival, Tyler must make the right decisions in order to keep his crew alive and ship afloat as they near hostile waters on their way to safety.
The plot of the story follows a pretty basic pattern that is intensified by the suspense of the action sequences and the way in which Mostow works his magic with the camera. I found myself guessing what was going to happen in certain scenes of the movie, mainly because after seeing the trailer, I knew there was more that had to happen than just allowing the sub to sink and the Germans to win. And as much as the story does for its characters and their will to survive, I knew that the script would not shortchange them in the long run. This really doesn't hinder the story, though; it still has a lot to offer.
Mostow has done a masterful job in creating an atmosphere that is tightly cramped and perilous all at the same time. The lighting used for the insides of the sub is merely the lights actually shown, not offscreen, giving it an authentic and real feel. The crew finds themselves huddled tightly together at times during sequences in which depth charges are deployed to harm the ship, which adds to the sense of small space while also keeping us at bay with the question of whether or not the vessel will make it through the treachery of the explosions. The depth charges provide the most ominous threat to the vessel, which is carried out on film in a most intense manner. The first set of explosions takes place outside of the vessel, where we can see everything that's going on, while the second set keeps us inside the sub so that all we can do is hold our breath with the crew and wait for the explosions to end.
The fact that the movie can set up this kind of connection is a testament to its brilliance. Mostow is able to bring us into the movie with the characters, giving us bird's-eye views of the action as well as taking us right into the middle of it. Either way, the effect is truly awesome, showing us a different kind of warfare that can be just as intense and terrifying as hand-to-hand and firearm combat on land. When the movie was over, I felt jolted and out of breath; the movie simply delivers the goods.
The visual and sound effects also help to bring us into the movie's rich canvas as well. Miniatures and life-size vessels were used in the filming of the actual submarine, and while the effects that surround it may be digitized, it helps to have something that is real to harness the look and acuity of the shot. The sound design and use of the elements available is tremendous and pleasing, with a low bass frequency playing pretty much throughout the entire movie to create a sense of tension. This is one of those big, loud effects movies that, even if you don't care for the story, will please on its visuals and sound alone.
Casting is an important factor in bringing out the emotion and depth, and this one, an all-star ensemble, does just that. Matthew McConaughey is the ambitious Lieutenant Andrew Tyler, who is the strongest of the characters. He is portrayed as earnest in his endeavors to save his crew, while keeping the movie from degenerating into a blatant effects show. Harvey Keitel is Chief Klough, a pivotal character who advises and aides Tyler in some pretty tight situations. He keeps Tyler from losing his cool, which is important for the movie. Bill Paxton plays Lieutenant Dahlgren, and while his character has little screen time, he does well in keeping us informed of the events at hand. Jake Weber is a convincing Lieutenant Hirsch, who knows everything about the mission and plays his character with integrity and intelligence.
One of the better war films to come out of Hollywood, ""U-571"" follows an intense and gripping storyline that delivers the goods to even those who don't follow the war film trend. Under the direction of Jonathon Mostow, who also directed the thriller ""Breakdown,"" the film contains a stellar cast that knows what it's doing and superb visual and sound effects that add to the atmosphere of suspense.",993340800,,5376,4.588357588357589

This film trys to makes the Germans out to be filthy and brutal by killig the survivers of the submarine which the blew up. The also made the Germans look bad by when the Americans let the Captain live, how he escapes and sabortages the sub.

It all starts off with an American Captain leading his crew in WWII, who then leads his crew to victory eventually after many close misses with the Germans. It typically is quite stereotypical as it makes the Germans out to be the bad ones just like many other movies and the Americans to be the good guys. A inacurracy is during WWII the Americans weren't even in the war at that stage. It is a typical American movie when there is a lot of big baddies around with one small goodie (this being the U-571) and know matter how good the opponents the goodies (Americans) always come out on top.

1. The Americans were not involved in war during this time. 2. The British were the ones that captured the enigma machine.

This movie, aside the fact that nothing in the events was close to the real happenings, was a thriller. It combined the old World War 2 style of events with the gung-ho and always courageous effort of the all-muscly Americans.
It is set around the capture of the Enigma coding machine, by the Brits, in Spring- 1942, and was to be of major victory to the allied forces in the coming days. The Americans (the ONLY contributers to the war.....) decided they would twist the events and make it look like they had done everything and won us the war.  All in all it was a great success, and the movie was awesome in the fact that it showed the reality of what life at war was really like 50 years ago. But it still lacked a few major facts. - The real U571 was destroyed 2months before this even happened. - The Americans weren't even in the war at the time. - The British were the courageous young lads who led the daring  assault.

In fact, the Brits seized Enigma before America had even joined the war. this shows us that it is just another movie that was made so that they could get big bucks. in 1942, the U.S. Navy had a minimal role in the Battle of the Atlantic. Also around this time U-Boats were ranging up and down the largely undefended American coastline, sinking hundreds of ships in the process. The defeat of the U-Boats was largely the result of years of struggle and effort by the Royal Navy and at the very least, the film should have made mention of the role played by the British in defeating the U-Boats. Instead, the film tells viewers that, until the timely arrival of the heroic Americans, the Germans largely had their way with the British. In another scene, the German crew of the U-571 brutally machine guns a lifeboat full of survivors from a presumably torpedoed merchant ship. Overriding the objections of the crew, the captain tells his men that it was ""the Fuhrer's order"" to kill all survivors of shipwrecks. this was done to make the Germans look even worse than they were.",993340800,,1216,4.6342592592592595

This then made them look like the good guys in the film. The Germans are made out to be the bad guys in the film with their dress been rather scrubbed up and their beards been not shaven at all.
The film rather in accurate in the way it betrayed both of countries in the way that they did. An inaccuracy was that the Americans weren't even in the war yet. The Americans didn't move in to the war until a later stage.

2484613,4,B000E1ZK5A,"I have been a history buff for many years, and have often spent time reading the book on which a movie was based.  But the why's and wherefore's of something that occurred before, during or after a war that relate to actual events intrigue me.  I have read the magazines ""Airpower"" and ""Warbirds"" and encountered reference after reference made to the intelligence war being fought between the Axis powers and the Allies.  One of those magazines had a 3-part series about intelligence measures and counter-measures.  Many references were made to the ""the Enigma"" code which the Allies had a hard time breaking.  I am very impressed by the role the submariners played in this little ""side"" war.  If you have seen ""Das Boot"" or ""Run Silent, Run Deep"", you will appreciate how little room there was for all these people to do their specific jobs.  I'm 6 ft. tall and getting through the captured U-boat at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry  was extremely difficult.  God bless the master chiefs of the Navy.  If it were not for them, order and chaos would have existed in many of our ships.  The Master Chief of this movie was pretty much true to life: gruff men, making very young men into true sailors and acting as a balm on either the Captain's ego or the Commander's striving for his own command, his word meant something to everyone, and is depicted well in this movie.  I appreciate the acting done by all people involved.  None of it was wooden or robot like; at the show's end, I found myself empathizing with the crew when a crash with the destroyer was imminent, or the despair in their voices when neither descent nor ascent rates could be controlled.  A good movie, moreso for those who have some understanding of officer/enlisted relations, the rat's life of a submariner, and a bit of true history woven in for education's sake.",992131200,,1848,4.66358024691358
2484614,5,B000E1ZK5A,"The DVD version of U-571 is a solid package of not only the great movie about human triumph but also a lot of supplementary materials - interviews done with submarine experts, director, cast and even a rather amusing video clip taken from the Royal Navy archives.
I think it is unfair to judge U-571 in terms of its accuracy with history facts. This movie, was NOT meant to replicate any specific event that transpired in the war. If you had seen the DVD's interview clip with the director, the movie was meant to be a fictional tale!
I don't know how true the scenes in the movie were when compared to that of the real stuff on a submarine. But for the layman like me, I think it is convincing enough to suppress my skeptism. In fact, the scenes could even be rated as professional, with all sorts of technical lingo being reiterated throughout the film.
The strength of U-571 lies in the suspense build-up. For instance, the scene where death charges were dropping over the U-571 was a good suspense-filled part of the movie.  War tactics employed by the submariners also help to lend a certain quality of intelligence to the whole movie.  After all the ordeal the submariners on U-571 had gone through, I felt proud for them at the finale, that they managed to overcome their enemy.

A German Type VII submarine that survives explosions of depth charges less than 10 meters away, torps another dived submarine, dives below 200 meters regularly, goes muzzle to muzzle with a German destroyer (how did this thing get into the Atlantic anyway?) and sinks it with a single torpedo (not to mention an explosion like a Chinese nuclear torp)?
Sounds like the dream of 30.000 seamen come true.
Okay, enough sarcasm. It is a nice-made movie. What really surprised me is that - unlike most compareable movies - the original crew of U-571 was really speaking German language and all the gauges, levers and buttons have the correct markings. I really would like to know, if the U.S. version of this movie has subtitles, because the European version has none. Compared to - naturally - Das Boot, the optical presentation of U-571 is much better after 20 years, but the athmosphere of being inside such a steel tube is being presented much better on board of U-96 (a Type VII sub, too). Another point where U-571 can't win against Das Boot is Klaus Doldinger's great soundtrack of DB, but on the other hand, being much more action-oriented, U-571 got no long periods of talking, waiting and thinking that made Das Boot sometimes hard to bear for the typical action freak.
If you like submarines, light stories, well-made action and have seen movies like Hunt For Red October, Crimson Tide and Das Boot, you've found the right movie.

An American submarine crew is sent to retrieve a coding device from a damaged German U-Boat.  Jonathan Mostow has created a claustrophobic and very terrifying environment inside the submarines and during the battle scenes.  The performances are all good with Matthew McConaughey leading the charge and Jake Webster and Harvey Keitel following with equally impressive performances.

Matthew McConaughey, Harvey Keitel, and every single cast member of this movie is spectacular.  Every last one.  They work together so well, they really made the movie convincing.
The special effects are incredible.  The sound--especially if you have a Dolby-ready television--blows you away.  I could watch those splashes fall all day long.
The story line can be a little hoky at times, just like any other movie--the axe scene, the cheesy final scene--but the rest of the movie makes up for it.  This is one of the most gripping movies in recent memory.
The special features are incredible.  For all you staunch history buffs--everyone reviewing so far seems to be one--the shorts ""Inside The Enigma"" and ""Britain Captures the U-110"", and the documents in the ""U.S. Naval Archives: Capturing the U-505"" section, each give you the full, true story of how the Enigmas were seized.  Jonathan Mostow repeatedly reminds us the the British were the original ones who captured the machine.  So you can't claim that this is all ""propaganda"" if the director, producers, and actors will tell you that it was originally the British.
The special features are what truly make this DVD spectacular.  It has so many more than most DVDs, and they are all superb in quality.  Its especially interesting to listen to the story of the British submariner who was the first to grasp the Enigma, and also to see how they painstakingly recreated sea-worthy U-Boats for the film.

2484624,3,B000E1ZK5A,"U-571 is all promise and no payoff.  A neat dramatic trick starts us out with instant tension between the sub captain (Paxton) and his executive officer (McConaughey)--so McConaughey's on a slow boil as the mission gets underway.  Things start to happen quickly enough, surprises lurk, and before you know it, you're really into the story.  But somewhere after the half-way mark, the movie navigates its way into familiar waters.  At times, it's almost like we're watching parts of THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER all over again.  One of the crises McConaughey encounters is almost directly lifted from CRIMSON TIDE; another from DAS BOOT.  By the end, what had been a novel entry in the submarine sub-genre just barely limps back into port.
The DVD is helped somewhat by a whole range of extra features, but it's still not enough to make you happy about the ending.  If anything, the director's commentary almost makes things worse by its blindness about the banality of the film's ending.  Worth getting only in this edition, because at least you'll learn a little something about filmmaking and the importance of Dino de Laurentis to the film industry.",987465600,,1148,4.942708333333333

In many ways plagiarizes Das Boot (e.g., depth charge scenes). Technically absurd: one single sub torpedo completely and instantly blowing up a destroyer (this is a crucial scene in the film)? Come on. Psychologically unrewarding. The human side of the main characters is underdeveloped. You have a  German captain captured and then he plays almost no role in the entire plot? A lost opportunity. And so on. Only redeeming item: five-star actor Harvey Keitel, unfortunately in one of his weakest performances (not his fault: it's the script, stupid!)

The movie takes us along the ride as the men, lead by the talented Matthey McConaughey (playing Lieutenant Andrew Tyler) use their training and skills to pilot the foreign U-571 in order to save their lives! Jon Bon Jovi did an excellent job as Lieutenant Pete Emmett, although all you fans looking to see Bon Jovi through out the whole film, may be dissapointed! (He's only in the 1st third of the movie)  Harvey Keitel as Chief Klough is a wonderful and talented edition as well.

Despite the fact that there were subtitles, I ran into a few problems since I only speak English and Russian, and not German. The camera goes back and forth between the Americans and Germans so that the viewer has the entire point of view, which I don't like because it adds to predictability. Then, when the Americans take over the German sub, everything is said so technically and is confusing as all out. They could have made the sub engine gears more subtle, and focused on the battle, but they didn't.

2484630,4,B000E1ZK5A,"""U-571"" is a pleasing and very exciting movie, one that can be enjoyed by followers and non-followers of war movies alike. It's one of those all-encompassing movies that has something in it for everyone: dazzling visual and sound effects for tech junkies, a gripping story based on similar events of war, and suspense and action for those looking to be surprised. This is a summer blockbuster that actually pleases its crowds, and certainly a movie that ranks with some of the best and most well-known war movies in Hollywood.
The movie begins, fittingly enough, in the German submarine after which the movie is named, and the Germans have just finished bombing an American ship. Soon after, they are set upon by a destroyer, which depth-charges the fragile vessel and leaves it crippled and in need of repairs. They send a call our for help, which is found by the Americans. This provides them with the opportunity to crack the secret code the Germans have been using by boarding the damaged vessel under the guise of German soldiers and stealing the Enigma, which houses the codes.
The beginning of the movie allows us to get to know our American characters, with whom we will be spending a great deal of time during the movie. We are introduced to Captain Andrew Tyler, who has just found out that he did not receive the position of captain as he had hoped. His commander, Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren, feels he does not have what it takes to be a captain at this point, and that his emotional connection to his shipmates would prevent him from putting them in situations of potential danger.
Soon, our men are on their sub, heading out to sea, where they encounter the German submarine, take the crew hostage, and swipe the Enigma and code book to bring back to the attention of the U.S. Armed Forces. However, the German sub that responded to their call for help destroys the American sub, killing the German hostages and some Americans, leaving the rest of the crew on the German sub with Tyler as their captain. As their special ops mission turns into a race for survival, Tyler must make the right decisions in order to keep his crew alive and ship afloat as they near hostile waters on their way to safety.
The plot of the story follows a pretty basic pattern that is intensified by the suspense of the action sequences and the way in which Mostow works his magic with the camera. I found myself guessing what was going to happen in certain scenes of the movie, mainly because after seeing the trailer, I knew there was more that had to happen than just allowing the sub to sink and the Germans to win. And as much as the story does for its characters and their will to survive, I knew that the script would not shortchange them in the long run. This really doesn't hinder the story, though; it still has a lot to offer.
Mostow has done a masterful job in creating an atmosphere that is tightly cramped and perilous all at the same time. The lighting used for the insides of the sub is merely the lights actually shown, not offscreen, giving it an authentic and real feel. The crew finds themselves huddled tightly together at times during sequences in which depth charges are deployed to harm the ship, which adds to the sense of small space while also keeping us at bay with the question of whether or not the vessel will make it through the treachery of the explosions. The depth charges provide the most ominous threat to the vessel, which is carried out on film in a most intense manner. The first set of explosions takes place outside of the vessel, where we can see everything that's going on, while the second set keeps us inside the sub so that all we can do is hold our breath with the crew and wait for the explosions to end.
The fact that the movie can set up this kind of connection is a testament to its brilliance. Mostow is able to bring us into the movie with the characters, giving us bird's-eye views of the action as well as taking us right into the middle of it. Either way, the effect is truly awesome, showing us a different kind of warfare that can be just as intense and terrifying as hand-to-hand and firearm combat on land. When the movie was over, I felt jolted and out of breath; the movie simply delivers the goods.
The visual and sound effects also help to bring us into the movie's rich canvas as well. Miniatures and life-size vessels were used in the filming of the actual submarine, and while the effects that surround it may be digitized, it helps to have something that is real to harness the look and acuity of the shot. The sound design and use of the elements available is tremendous and pleasing, with a low bass frequency playing pretty much throughout the entire movie to create a sense of tension. This is one of those big, loud effects movies that, even if you don't care for the story, will please on its visuals and sound alone.
Casting is an important factor in bringing out the emotion and depth, and this one, an all-star ensemble, does just that. Matthew McConaughey is the ambitious Lieutenant Andrew Tyler, who is the strongest of the characters. He is portrayed as earnest in his endeavors to save his crew, while keeping the movie from degenerating into a blatant effects show. Harvey Keitel is Chief Klough, a pivotal character who advises and aides Tyler in some pretty tight situations. He keeps Tyler from losing his cool, which is important for the movie. Bill Paxton plays Lieutenant Dahlgren, and while his character has little screen time, he does well in keeping us informed of the events at hand. Jake Weber is a convincing Lieutenant Hirsch, who knows everything about the mission and plays his character with integrity and intelligence.
One of the better war films to come out of Hollywood, ""U-571"" follows an intense and gripping storyline that delivers the goods to even those who don't follow the war film trend. Under the direction of Jonathon Mostow, who also directed the thriller ""Breakdown,"" the film contains a stellar cast that knows what it's doing and superb visual and sound effects that add to the atmosphere of suspense.",985996800,,6117,4.623161764705882

The action scenes make you feel like you are right in the middle of the action. I can't fathom anyone making derogatory remarks about the sound. Running this DVD with Boston Acoustics speakers and a Velodyne sub; the depth charges rattled the window!!! If you have trouble with the sound on this DVD, I highly recommend you check to see if your HT is hooked up correctly!! 2. The story: This story is not historically accurate of the Enigma capture. WHO CARES. This is not a movie for the History Chanel, it is a Hollywood action/drama. If you have a vested interest in the historical accuracy then you won't like this film. If you are looking for a good hollywood production with a story line a little different from the typical car chase crap then this is for you.",985564800,,944,4.526315789473684

The sub, however, is carrying an enigma machine, a priceless piece of communication equipment that encrypts/decrypts German messages.  In the hands of the Allies, it could be the difference between losing and winning the war.
An American sub is immediately sent out to retrieve the enigma from the German sub.  But the Germans are aware of it too and are trying to reach it from the opposite direction before the enemy can get their hands on it.  What follows is a non-stop thrill ride.",984700800,,825,4.963503649635037

2484635,4,B000E1ZK5A,"""U571"" is a Great Example of Turning an OK Premise into a Good Script and making a Great Movie. The Film provides all the Required Sub movie Thrills and although it doesn't add anything new to the Genre, it Serves it's Function by Being all it can Be in the Thrill department.
I believe that it's a Step Up for the Director Jonathon Mostow. His last film ""Breakdown"" did not feature the required thrills and I found it Predictable and Boring, ""U571"" was Neither of those things, some have called it predictable, but I don't believe that they Predicted the twist half way through, (No Spoilers, see it for yourself) and I don't think anyone can call it boring.
Sure, no Crew men will be reeling in a Oscar, but startling performances arn't what the films about, theres no room for them, they slow a film down, as does Character Development. The Acting here is as good as it needs to be.
All in All, it's a great nights entertainment, A Bare Bones Thriller that Achieves what it set out to, to thrill the audience for an Hour and Forty minutes.",983232000,,1042,4.460732984293194
2484636,2,B000E1ZK5A,"My first major complaint with this film is that when I went to see it in the theatres, the movie studio made the house turn the sound ALL THE WAY UP for added realism. No what this meant for everyone? Louder sound than a heavy metal concert. There were people literally running out of the auditorium during the film because it was so loud. I am totally serious! I don't know if every screening across the country was like this, but I had a hearing problem for the next several hours. I am 20 years old, and love loud music/movies, and even I found this to be absurd.
And beside all the historical facts that are twisted and removed just to make this film seem believable, it was not that well acted either. I think the producers were trying to make a sub flick that compared to earlier classics, such as ""Run Silent Run Deep"" that they told the actors to ham it up a bit, trying to equal the star power of that classic. But with lightweights such as Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton leading the troops, expect some major stretches in talent here.
The plot, about a Navy submarine crew that attempts to board a German U-boat for intellegence purposes, ends up stuck on it after their own sub gets sunk. The next 10 hours(at least it felt like 10 hours when watching it) involves the McConaughey trying to lead his crew back to shore, but they become chased by the Germans, and you get the SAME SCENE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. It is always about holding the sub together after a ""near miss"" depth charge and evading the entire German Fleet.
I recommend that you do not see this movie, it is not even worth the rental price. The sound quality, when it isn't turned all the way up, is impressive, but that is the only bright spot.",982886400,,1724,4.373831775700935
2484637,3,B000E1ZK5A,"First of all U571 is a decent story about American involvment in world war II at capturing enigma machines.  The previous customer reviewer John Loizou is full of crap.  1 the Americans were involved in capturing the enigma machines 2. His jealousy is apparent, in saying that the United States played no part in winning the war 3. He does not know his facts, the Americans captured enigma machines twice.  Don't listen to that jealous foreign freak.  This movie is not to bad. The realism of the inside of the sub is pretty cool.  And yes I have seen ""The Boat"" an earlier submarine version that previous customers have mentioned as ""Das boot""  It is true that there are some inaccuracies about this movie and some of the acting is a little cheesy, particularly the black cook.  This is a huge blunder.  I have every respect for African Americans, but the truth of the matter is that they navy was segregated and they didnot serve on submarines.  Him saying to the captured Germans ""you've never seen a black man before, get used to it"" is just a political statement by the producers or rather their attempts at being politically correct.  They were trying to include someone outside of the white race to make the movie politically correct.  But don't get caught up in this point, I just hate to see historical films portrayed inaccurately so that someone can make a political statement.

If you have a good surround system, then crank it up and upset the neighbors, the depth charge explosions are something to behold.

I don't see how anyone can call it inaccurate, it isn't.""  Apparently people  now consider Hollywood producers and directors historians.  Sigh.  Statements like this demonstrate how Hollywood gets away with making second rate movies like this one.
The movie is mildly entertaining--although the characters are one-dimensional and the story is pretty predictable--some of the underwater scenes are well done.  But, for accuracy, I'll watch Das Boot which is a pretty accurate respresentation of submariners (if you subtract the ficticous use of red battle lights--it isn't as if a sub has windows people).
I think the movie would have played better if it was at least about a British sub crew (FYI I'm a ""yank"") and have given more credit to the fact that the Brits were the ones who captured the Enigma.  Other reviewers have made good points about how we ripped off the Brits and didn't give them enough credit in the movie--I have to agree with this.

Along comes an American film director looking for a story to make American film-goers happy. To make them think that every historical event in this planets history was somehow influenced positively by the USA.
This isn't just a case of 'oh well, go along with it' as many reviewers here have said. This is a growing problem with AMerican movies as American children, by the US' own admission, are becoming dumb on world history. This is a country where children think the Indians were a bunch of wild savages and had no right to be there. Children, thanks to the Patriot, think Britain invaded America. And a country where Children think William Wallace was an American. and King of Scotland.
It's about time Hollywood started putting some truths in their historical epics. As Mel Gibson put it 'History is boring, and doesn't sell.' Why is that Mel? Why would it have been any different if this film had contained a British crew capturing ENIGMA? The only difference is Mel, if the Americans aren't the heroes, the cinema audiences don't want to know. And that's sad.

2484651,2,B000E1ZK5A,"This could have been a great movie.  This could have been an excellent movie.  Yes, it was a major fudging of history.  However, the ENIGMA, which was the focal point of the movie, was all too real.  The breaking of the ENIGMA code (by Alan Turing of Princeton university) was arguably the single greatest factor which served as the impetus for an allied victory in WWII. The ENIGMA was the encrypted message system the Germans used to deploy their fleet. So convinced were the Nazis that it could not be broken that they refused to believe it was compromised, even when they began losing ships & submarines at an alarming pace.  However, that's another story.
As other reviewers have pointed out, this movie is pure fiction about the Allied recovery of ENIGMA equipment.  In real history, it was the British, not the US, who were successful at this.  However, if one is willing to just ""go with it,"" this still could have been a decent movie.
What causes the undoing of this movie is the acting.  Or, should I say, the lack thereof?  Matthew McConaughey, in particular, turns in a truly horrid performance.  He is so dull & bland that he makes Kevin Costner seem flamboyant by comparison.  Bill Paxton isn't much better.  I nearly fell asleep when these two had their CO / XO talk early on in the film.  Watching both of them attempt to act was about as exciting as seeing an earthworm compete in a 100 meter dash.

It's also a great DVD.  Sound and image are reference quality. You'll watch this one more than once.  This one is up there with Das Boot as far as the atmosphere that is created while the sub and it's inhabitants are being hunted by depth-charge dropping destroyers.

2484653,1,B000E1ZK5A,"the acting was terrible and the story was ludicrous, but thats just the begining. the technical innaccuracies were astounding to say the least, depth charges cannot be reeled off at the pace they were in this film, shooting a gun on a wwII uboat is not a great idea, cavitating was an unknown concept in wwII, i could go on and on...
the absolute worst part of it though was the sidelining of real history. the enigma was captured by a royal navy (great britain) ship and it wasn't even slightly exciting (well at least in a hollywood sense) the german uboat was simply hit by a depth charge and upon surfacing the crew surrendered. the opertator in charge of the enigma one time pad didn't do his job and destroy the pad. simple as that...as a final insult the tacked on title ""honoring"" the real heroes was also annoying in that the one united states military achievment was posted as USS... of the United States Navy, while the british were simply listed as RMS (royal majesties ship) which i doubt 80% of people here in the states would know.

Some criticize it for being inaccurate, take a listen to the director's commentary. Johnathon Mostow was very concerned about the accuracy of this film. I don't see how anyone can call it inaccurate, it isn't.
As for the fans of Das Boot, there is one critical thing wrong with Das Boot, it's not the right way to portray German submariners. They were portrayed as good people fighting for the wrong cause, that isn't true - Nazi submariners were probably the most pro-Nazi of all German soldiers. They were very passionate about fighting and U-571 does a great job of portraying that angle - the correct one.
If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of WWII, U-571 is it. It may not be factual, but that's ok - who cares - if you want facts, watch the Discovery Channel. It's full of action and suspense.",979171200,,860,4.590909090909091

It is not enough that the DVD states the historical truth after the film has finished. This is hugely disrespectful to servicemen, and an embarassing display of crass ignorance.

2484663,3,B000E1ZK5A,"U-571 was a good movie, average at best. The screenplay was outstanding, if you think about the concept; a bunch of men stuck in a submarine for a long period of time trying to save their own necks. It doesn't make for exciting cinema, but they pulled it off somehow. There were solid performances throughout the movie, although some casting could have been done better, and the movie kept you on your toes. There were 3 things wrong with the movie, inaccuracy, no higher sense of purpose, and Bill Paxton's character.  The inaccuracy may have been what kept the movie alive, and definitely it helps create a great DVD, but all of those depth charges (the source of the explosions) at such close range just suspends any kind of belief in the movie. Then of course there is the race to the bottom of the ocean and the destruction of the battle ship (to borrow a line from Dr. Evil ""right""). The other problem is that there is no sense of higher purpose portrayed by the characters which might have given the movie more emotion. Sure the higher purpose was interlaced with the plot, but there was no mention or thought about the importance of their mission. Lastly, and I think more importantly, is the casting of Bill Paxton as the advice-giving father figure. It just doesn't work. It would have been more effective had he repeated an earlier performance; his role in Aliens. The movie needed a memorable smartalick, a role that Paxton plays better than anyone else. The movie can be watched once, but other than that it would just be a waste of 2 hours of your life.",978480000,,1567,4.576512455516014

It's non-stop action and thrills from the start.  No, it doesn't compare to ""Das Boots"" perhaps the best sub movie ever made, but who cares.  This movie on it's own is well worth the watch and truly entertains.  It's a great way to spend a couple of hours and experience what it was really like on these U-boats during the war.  The special effects are amazing, the camera work is outstanding, and the feelings and emotions are very realistic as portrayed by Matthew McConaughey, and Bill Paxton.  I also thought Jon Bon Jovi did a wonderful job, ( a very natural actor) although his part was short in this film.
There are many extra's on this DVD that shouldn't be missed.  Make sure you find time to watch how the special effects were done.  An excellent movie to add to your collection, to watch over and over again.",977961600,,971,4.415730337078652
2484666,4,B000E1ZK5A,"For a person who is not crazy about Matt McConaughey's acting ability, I actually thought this was a pretty good movie.  The English reviewers are correct that the Brits/Polish actually found the ""enigma"" machine first, but the end credits show that on a third mission, Americans also came up with a piece of the puzzle.  So yes the film took some liberalities when devising the mission and its importance for America's wartime efforts.  They probably should have portrayed a British sub, but marketing concerns most likely nixed this approach.  Historical inaccuracies aside, the film was suspenseful, intelligent and entertaining.  The special effects made everything seem pretty realistic and didn't detract from the film.  Maybe Kietel seemed miscast for his part, but younger people often have higher ranking than their elders, especially if they went to Annapolis.  Overall a good film.",977961600,,892,5.328571428571428
2484667,3,B000E1ZK5A,"U-571 does well in recreating the cramped, nervous world of the WWII submariner.  Clearly, a lot of research was put into this aspect of the film.  The opening act with the sub's German crew making a torpedo run on a cargo ship was especially well done.  The action sequences were exciting provided one overlooked the impossibility of ten or so Americans successfully manning a German submarine designed for a crew of sixty.  Similarly, someone on the set must have thought that firing a torpedo is just a point and shoot affair rather than a wonderfully refined mathematical process.  Trying to ignore this and some of the other plot holes became somewhat distracting for me.  But the acting was credible and the film remained interesting to the end. Still, wouldn't it be great if we reached a point where the obligatory ""German's machine-gunning civilians scene"" could be omitted from movies like this?",977961600,,905,4.960264900662252

2484674,4,B000E1ZK5A,"The titular U-571, the crippled German sub found by an American strike team, barely survived depth charging by British destroyers before coming up for air and screaming for help.  Hitting on a plan to ambush the stricken sub by posing as a rescuing U-Boat, the US Navy enlists the crew of an obsolete S-Class submarine - more adavnced US subs are too big to convincingly masquerade as one of the diminuitive U-Boats.  The real prize is not the U-Boat, which the yanks plan to scuttle, but the enigma, a code machine used to coordinate the U-Boats into deadly squadrons of hunter-killers.  Only with coordinated attacks can the U-Boats (which barely move 20 knots on the surface and much slower when submerged) stand a chance of making dents in American and British convoys.
The initial ambush is reasonably flawless, down to the Enigma's capture.  When U-571's real relief appears, all bets are off, and the boarding party, finds itself trapped on the U-boat with an ocean of enemies all around.  Led by Andy Tyler (Matt McConnaughey), a tireless naval officer eager for command, the crew struggles to adapt what they know of American subs to the U-Boat.  Their mission is now two-fold: reach ""safe"" waters, but without being spotted.  If the Germans were to learn of the U-Boat's capture, they'd modify the Enigma code and make it useless, cutting off the western navies from trackong the silent killers. ....  I never thought this a true story, just a very realistic fictional one.  I never got the impression that the Americans actually cracked the enigma code - just stole one of the machines.  Even the critics seem split on who should get the credit (whether the Poles or the British). .... Though ""U-571"" seems imply that other nations were uninvolved - a closing ""crawl"" only lists the exploits of American crews who recovered code machines - I still never got the impression that no others were involved in at least trying to get the vaunted machines.  For one thing, teh film makes clear that reovery of the Enigma requires such secrecy, that previous recoveries may not be known.
as for submairne warfare iteself, U-571 is probably the most realistic film on the subject.  If ""571"" isn't realistic, then we can probably write-off just about every other submarine war film.  In ""571"", surfaced subs roll on the waves like tin cans and leak water like sieves.  Depth charges explode from every direction, rattling the nerves of the bravest men.  Crews burn, drown, or simply lose their minds.  The heroics are, like subs, elusive, yet stable by crushing pressure.  The vulnerability of the subs is quite plain - even the act of machine-gunning survivors of a merchantman sent to the bottom by a u-boat seems more like an act of self-preservation than cruelty (the survivors will only alert rescuers to the sub's location).  What other film has that?
The only downside to the film?? [Watch it to find out] Even this seems to be a concession to realism - eluding surface threats was long-drawn-out and often futile.",976406400,,3022,4.8576998050682265

2484676,1,B000E1ZK5A,"It is refeshing to know that some of the American reviewers of this film recognise the absolute fabrication this movie makes of the Enigma capture.  WWII British intelligence repeatedly advised the US Navy of the existence of a Nazi 'Enigma' machine which was coordinating U-boat attacks on US vessels but the information was ignored - much to the United States peril - they went on to lose multitudes of ships and human lives all along the eastern US seaboard.
It was not until an British vessel 'accidentally' found the machine on a captured U-boat that the actual device could be fully studied and was enough evidence for the US to finally take appropriate action.
Would it have been such a commercial trade off to have told the truth if this story was supposedly based on fact?

As a matter of fact one of the highlights of the film for me is the stirring musical piece towards the end and the softer theme during the titles. As mentioned before the plot is too far fetched, a submarine destroying a submarine with a torpedo...a submarine blowing a destroyer out of the water with a lucky shot...depth charges bending the subs hull out of shape but causing no effect etc etc etc. Interestingly this movie arose some interest, in the events relating to it, in my three sons ages 13-20! That is more than I can say about a LOT of movies!! They were glued with the action and later asked about subs, about WWII and about the Enigma secret.

Do you want to see a fact based account of the capturing of a WWII German submarine? If so, then this is not the movie for you. However, if you are looking for an action packed, fast paced movie about WWII submarines, then I think you will like this film.
Yes, I will admit that this movie has it flaws, and not the least of which is the cast. Bill Paxton's performance as the U.S. submarine captain is just a cut above cardboard. He is flat, and acts as though he is completely void of any emotion, and the foreshadowing speech he gives to McConaughey near the beginning of the film gives away far too much of the movie. There are several other inconsistencies in the film, but I think they can be overlooked if you really want to enjoy the film. The biggest problem is the ending or really the lack of one. It seemed almost as if they either didn't know how to end it, or just ran out of money to shoot a fitting final scene, but the way they left it was just mind boggling. On the bright side, I think McConaughey gives a pretty good performance as the young Lt. Commander thrust into duty against unthinkable odds, and Harvey Keitel gives a very steady portrayal as the veteran Chief trying to help his crew stay alive.
 Sure there are those who will pick this movie apart because of the historical, and technological inaccuracies, but I have to think that those people didn't want to like the movie in the first place, and should have watched a history channel documentary instead. ""U-571"" is not fact based, or historical, but it is a well told, taught, action thriller. Had the performance by Paxton been better, and the use of foreshadowing been a little less of an in your face ""this is what's going to happen"" type speech, I would have given it a higher rating. This is definitely a movie worth seeing, but I don't think I would add it to my collection unless the price was just right.",975283200,,1989,4.346774193548387

I think some of the other reviewers of this movie have forgotten that this was fiction based on reality. This paticular event never did occur but it very well could've.

2484682,1,B000E1ZK5A,"Embarrassing for the cast, the writers, the director and to be an American. I missed the opportunity to watch this film on the big screen during the summer, I am glad I did. Perhaps I have become spoiled by the excellence and craft of other film makers, their attention to detail and the effortlessness in which they transport me into their film; never once having the thought cross my mind this was a bunch of actors standing on a sound stage reciting lines per a script. From the opening of U-571 that is all you see. Not once did I believed they were actually on a submarine, as in Das Boot or Hunt for Red October, instead the actors entered and left a huge set looking uncomfortable in their uniform costumes.
  The script itself is poorly written with inappropriate emotional scenarios and inconsistencies in all the characters. A crewman's response to orders to put his dead buddy in the torpedo tube along with refuse and detritus to hopefully fool the German destroyer circling overhead into thinking they've had been hit: ""Like...like garbage Lieutenant?"" He asks softly, eyes distaught. Watching helplessly the day before as the rest of his crew mates were killed during a torpedo attack, screaming in agony till the waves sucked them under had done nothing to harden him to the realities of war and certainly challenging a direct order when all their lives are at risk is perfectly acceptable, especially when time is off the essence. A little hand holding is always important amongst men in a crisis.
  Bad as the entire viewing was, the coup de grace for this film comes at the end, leaving a very, very bad taste in this American's mouth. When the credits roll by there is a list of ships that had captured different parts of the enigma machine through the war, going through trials and sacrifices like what had just been witnessed. Every ship began with HMS except one.

2484683,2,B000E1ZK5A,"You probably shouldn't, but can't help but try to compare this movie to the German submarine classic movie `Das Boot'.  In my eyes it just doesn't compare. There are just too many plot holes and unbelievable plot elements, mainly in the battle scenes, to make this one enjoyable for me. Bad melodramatic acting, particularly Paxton, and horrible musical score didn't help. There is one short `making of' featurette covering several aspects of making the film but nothing amazingly interesting was revealed.  Most of the techniques were pioneered in other movies. Even with CGI, which wasn't available 20 years ago when `Das Boot' was filmed, U-571 still doesn't look any better than `Das Boot'. Having the production designer from `Das Boot' couldn't make U-571 on par with `Das Boot.' A interesting 1940's news reel on the capture by the Americans of a U-boat is historically entertaining as well as an interview with one of the British sailors that captured the first Enigma machines. A short interview with a historian of the Enigma machine is included, but gives only cursory information, that is better covered in other documentaries. An interview with the WWII submarine consultant is included, but mainly consists of him stating, ""Yes, this could have happened,"" and ""Yes, that is realistic,"" etc. I didn't find it all that interesting. A trailer as well as a two bonus trailers for other films, Pitch Black and EdTV, not even of the same genre are included. The trailer shows scenes that were cut from the final film and these should have been added to the DVD as a bonus feature. The commentary is adequate with the director/writer talking about mainly what he was trying to do. He was trying to remake earlier American submarine movies that he loved as a child and it shows. Hence the overly patriotic theme, visuals, music, acting and script. Overall, there is nothing in the bonus features or the film itself that would make me want this in my collection.

Sure, it has its ""holes"" like most Hollywood interpretations of historical events, but it still packs a wallop as a fine bit of patriotic and heroic flag-waving.  McConaughey, Jon Bon Jovi, Harvey Keitel (an actor who is so underrated), and the supporting cast are believable in their respective roles.  They exhibit the full gamut of emotions of sailors under fire.
I was also pleased with the addition of T.C. Carson as a Navy steward who played a more significant role in the success of the mission.  This characterization was, perhaps, a salute to Dory Miller, the cook who downed Japanese fighters during the perilous attack on Pearl Harbor during WWII.

Hollywood's use of special effects foreclosed any realism, so much that the movie is better described as ludicrous. I could not wait for it to end. Das Boot is a much better movie.",973900800,,377,4.4
2484686,3,B000E1ZK5A,"In the commentary and supplementary materials, Writer/Director Jonathan Mostow stresses the attention to detail and accuracy of his portrayal of WW2 submarine warfare, and the bold claims he makes therefore entitle one to analyse and be critical of the result.
Much of the movie does indeed capture the essence of the submarine environment (the leaks in S-33 really added to the veracity), but Mostow can't resist the temptation to add typical Hollywood ""thriller"" incidents that are completely unrealistic.
Probably the most glaring impossibility/improbability was the undersea battle between the two U-boats firing torpedoes at each other. The chances of either U-boat's torpedoes getting anywhere near close to the other U-boat are close to zero, and I think perhaps only once in the entire war did a submarine successfully torpedo a submerged enemy submarine (firing into an unsuspecting target sub broadside-on not bow-on). Plainly also the torpedoes in this movie did not have magnetic/proximity detonators (the torpedo sliding along the side of U571!).
Indeed, Mostow gets the torpedo issues wrong most of the time. The movie opens with the U571 (in German hands) torpedoing a merchant ship. Total time from firing the torpedo until it explodes - oh, about five seconds! The captain had earlier said ""set speed for 35 knots"" (did the Germans also measure speed in knots?) and so this would mean that the torpedo was travelling at 60 feet every second - suggesting the merchant ship was only 300' away from the submarine!!! (A more realistic distance would be five to ten times further away and therefore a less exciting five to ten times longer delay in the movie between firing and exploding).
The startling inaccuracy/ineffectiveness of the German destroyer's gunnery both times that it was shooting at the U571 is also notable, particularly when contrasted against which was the amazing ability of the heros to deploy an unfamiliar submarine deck gun and fire it (did anyone see the gun being loaded?) all in a couple of seconds and hit the destroyer exactly where they wished! Hmmmm.
Of course, one doesn't really want to think too much about the German destroyer at all, because there was plain and simply just absolutely no way that a lone German destroyer would ever have been found in the mid-Atlantic.
It is also relevant to note not only the startling accuracy of the enemy depth charging but also the strangely underpowered nature of the depth charges!  A single depth charge detonating as close to the sub as many were portrayed as doing would have been sufficient to destroy it.  Instead, apart from the usual cinematic devices of water bursting from pipes (only to be conveniently stopped by a nearby valve) and light bulbs breaking (only to subsequently fix themselves when diesel power was restored!), no great damage occurred.
There were other more trivial errors, too, but they were not so central to the plot.  On the plus side, there were some wonderful sound effects, and I was amazed to learn that the sound of the U571 diesel engine was actually recorded from a real German submarine (U505 in the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago).
Overall, it was a good action flick, and if Mostow hadn't made such pretentious claims to accuracy, it would have been harder to criticise these aspects of it.

U-571 is for those of you in that second group.  It is an intense, perfectly-paced thriller whose only real ""flaw"" is that it is somewhat unrealistic in terms of historical effects.  You could cut the air (water?) with a knife during the action sequences, regardless of whether or not you take into account the unlikelyhood of the whole thing.

First, the acting is awful.  Bill Paxon's floating goodbye to McConaughey is sickly sweet.  Harvey Keitel's pep talk to the young McConaughey is also garbage.  Second, there was no sub-to-sub combat in WW2; no technology existed to make this possible.  In fact, several German subs were killed by their own torpedoes coming back on them.  Third, the film is xenophobic in that, after killing a German, an American wipes the blood off his coat as if he were wiping off dust.  This callous disregard for human life is intolerable.  Fourth, the callous disregard of history, in depicting the U-Boat captain ordering survivors in a lifeboat to be killed, is shameful.  There was only ONE such reported incident in WW2.  It is worth noting that one American captain similarly machine-gunned Japanese survivors.

Not even coming close to competing with the internationally acclamined movie Das Boot, this movie should be simply watched and admired for its good computer animated special effects.  Not to mention that this film was incredibly unrealistic when it came to effectively showing submarine combat in World War Two, I give you two examples from the film. Number one, there was no submarine to submarine combat in World War Two, the torpedoes on board German U-boats and American submarines alike did not have any lock-on devices, since that technology did not exist at the time, (Duh)the torpedoes, when fired, would simply continue in a straight line of fire until they either exploded accidentally or slammed into the sea-floor.  So, in that respect, it would be imposible to fire at another submarine that was traveling in the same direction moving fast, and not having any modern sonar or target aquisition technology on the torpedoes.  That is why submarines where mainly used in World War Two for the destruction of enemy convoys, which the Germans where quite good at.  The second example is towards the end of the film, when the Americans launch another torpedo at the bow of a German destroyer.  The destroyer mysteriously explodes in a ripple effect.  How could a destroyer suddenly ignite into a thousand pieces from being hit being hit in the bow.  Unless that's the place where the crew kept there secret stash of Chinese fire crackers?

Historically, this movie reaches far into the fiction catagory, even though the filmmakers admit that and show the historical facts before the ending credits.  See this movie for the entertainment, not for a history lesson.  Also, technically, I do find it a little hard to believe that a group of American submariners can learn how to control a German U-boat in under 10 minutes, even with a couple translaters to read valve designators.  It took me 8 monthes to get my ""dolphins"", so I found that aspect of the movie hard to believe.

While some have criticized this movie for its historical accuracy and the acting of its cast, Noone can dispute the fact that this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
Matthew McConaughey is an XO on an American sub in world war II. His mission is to help lead a team of sailors that will pose as Nazis in an attempt to board a crippled Nazi sub and take possession of its encryption devices. From the moment that the team boards the sub until the last credits, you will be wondering if there mission will ever be a success. First rate plot.
The visual and audio effects on this film are superb. The visual aspects of this film are fluid and nothing comes across looking like tiny scale models. (A problem that plagued films in the past). The audio track sells this DVD. You will get background noise when appropriate through your rear speakers. This is a great overall home theatre film.
The acting is nothing extraordinary, but it doesnt suffer either. While there are no showstoppers such as Sean Connery in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, noone drops the ball either. Harvey Keitel is as usual solid in a supporting role. There are some other relatively no name actors that give solid performances. Bill Paxton comes off as whiny and flat at the CO of the american sub. McConaughey gives an average performance. Therefore with acting as a consideration, I cant in good conscience call this a five star flick.
The DVD has some nice extras. A ""making of"" special and a nice piece on how they built the sub in the movie. Some average historical information also. Definately better than most DVD special feature sections.
Overall, a solid four star movie and DVD. Great for those who love WWII era movies and a must have for those who love great action. Pick up a copy today.",972864000,,1895,4.508720930232558

I watched Das Boot after I saw this movie because of all of the people saying it was not that good, you should see Das Boot, It's more realistic and historically correct. Well, Das Boot was more realistic, which made it boring at some points.  Historically correct, yes, but who cares. If I wanted to watch something about history I would watch Das Boot or the history channel, and U-571 never claimed to based on a true story.  Das Boot did have its moments, but far fewer then the boring parts.
U-571 was all action, non stop.  Very entertaining to watch, I even watched it three more times within one week.

Considering the ship had to be built from scratch for the movie the look and feel is so authentic you can almost smell the B.O. and spoiled food. The ensemble cast came off somewhat stiff with Matthew McConaughey leading the way. Although there were a few good acting moments the film is definitely dependent upon the action and effects to carry it. History buffs jilted the film for its inaccuracy since the first enigma machine was indeed captured by the British but, like other films have proven in the past as well as this summer, history should be taught in the class room and not on the movie screen. U-571 is an action adventure story which celebrates the courage of young men fighting for a cause but it is a fictional story set against an historical backdrop. The DVD extras are certainly worthwhile with commentaries, interviews, as well as documentaries. The picture and sound are what it's ultimately all about and U-571 delivers. The picture is beautiful and the Dolby Digital 5.1 is among very best soundtracks I've ever heard on a DVD and it has to be for intense depth charge sequences.

2484708,2,B000E1ZK5A,"Every so often a film comes along that so completely fulfills the demands of its genre that all such films that come after it seem to be little more than pale imitations in comparison.  Such a film is the 1981 German classic, ""Das Boot,"" undoubtedly the gold-standard against which all other submarine sagas must - fairly or unfairly - inevitably be measured.  Since that film pretty much exhausted the great humanistic themes of brotherhood and survival to be found in this category of films, the American submarine films that have come afterwards - ""The Hunt For Red October,"" ""Crimson Tide,"" and now, ""U-571"" - have been forced to turn to high level suspense plotting to supplement the standard genre conventions.  Each of these films has its moments but, the truth be told, one ends up invariably comparing these pieces of pulp entertainment to a genuine work of cinematic art - and there is just no comparison.
In a way, this genre, more than virtually any other, suffers from the cramped restrictions of its underwater setting.  There just isn't a lot to DO in a submarine and, hence, the directors of these films are obviously very limited in the way they can approach the material both visually and dramatically.  Thus, we are subjected to the endless tight close-ups on the men's worried, perspiring faces as they cast their eyes upward and strain their ears during the inevitable depth-charge and how-low-can-they-go-before-they-break-apart sequences.  We know that, before long, we will be watching that needle moving precariously into the red zone on the depth gauge, followed by the customary popping bolts, creaking hull and spouting water mains as the ship challenges the limits of its diving capabilities.  (Not one of these subs, in the history of the movies, by the way, has ever failed this test).  To get a little visual action into the picture, the cinematographer will, at some point or other, begin shaking the camera chaotically to simulate exploding depth charges a mere stone's throw from the ship's egg-like outer shell.
Unable to even approach ""Das Boot""s cinematic and technical expertise, ""U-571"" attempts to generate excitement with its action movie plotting and ambiance.  Regrettably, neither the story nor the characters in this film are particularly engaging.  Mathew McConaughey stars as Lt. Andrew Tyler, a naval officer who manages, through a complicated series of partly planned, partly inadvertent circumstances, to lead a group of men on board a German u-boat, kill most of its crew and cruise around the North Atlantic in a Trojan Horse type operation, while uncovering the German codebook they have been sent to find on the ship.  Unlike ""Das Boot,"" whose primary concern was to make its recreation of life aboard a sub as realistic and convincing as possible, ""U-571"" loses its way in a welter of action film histrionics, cardboard cutout characters and maudlin sentimentality.  Taylor is supposed to be a second-rate, overly-sensitive officer whom the bigwigs trust so little that they refuse to assign him a boat and a command of his own - but do we doubt, that by finale time, he will have proven himself to be a leader in the true-blue military tradition?  None of the characters in this film seem to differentiate themselves from one another in any way that would make us care about them.  They all seem to be, essentially, a group of dressed-up actors playing at soldier - a far cry from the fully fleshed-out and convincing set of characters that comprised Wolfgang Peterson's crew.
Perhaps it is unfair to judge ""U-571"" in relation to that earlier epic work.  (After all, ""Das Boot"" runs several hours longer than this film).  Nevertheless, it is a measure of the true greatness of that incomparable German masterpiece that it literally left nothing for future films to add to the genre.  It is all there in that one work - complete and perfect in its artistry and form.  Very few films sum up their genres as consummately as Wolfgang Peterson's ""Das Boot.""",972086400,,4009,4.976047904191617

It's sad that Hollywood has yet again resorted to the distortion of the truth in favor of big budget dollars, and preying on the ignorance of movie-goers. Let me also suggest, that in doing so, Hollywood yet again does a great in-justice to our men and women from the United States and from around the world who fought in WWII.
To boast that this movie reflects actual events is mis-leading, and the viewer should be cautious as the writers and director took great liberties in distorting the truth, and history itself.
However, to say the budget did not go all out in effects would be wrong. I was quite apppreciative of the action, the acting, and the all around brain candy this movie provided.

2484712,4,B000E1ZK5A,"A writer/director can take only so much artistic license before a story that is supposedly truth-based turns into a sham.  Jonathan Mostow runs dangerously close to that line.  The list of inaccuracies and improbabilities in this film is lengthy.  As has been noted numerous times, the British and not the Americans cracked the enigma code.  There were no blacks serving with whites on submarines, due to the segregation policy of the U.S. military before 1946.  The Germans were not evil, cold-blooded killers who strafed unarmed survivors.  The likelihood of a single torpedo hitting a ship showing only a bow profile is astronomically low, etc., etc., etc..
If you put aside the fact that this was pure fantasy rather than fact-based fiction, this film was great entertainment.  The story was engrossing, the action was non-stop and the suspense was extremely well done.  Mostow uses every submarine film device ever invented and gives the crew a continual flow of crises to solve.  Yes, it smacked of U.S. nationalism to a fault and the music was so insipidly patriotic it became corny.  However, though this was a shamelessly derivative work, it was intense and twisty with great special effects, and that made it worth watching.
Many people have compared this film with ""Das Boot"", concluding that this film pales by comparison to that classic.  ""Das Boot"" is one of my all time favorite films, but I really don't think you can compare the two.  They were really telling completely different types of stories.  ""Das Boot"" was a highly realistic character study and ""U-571"" was a fantasy action/adventure flick.  The only thing that they had in common was the fact that they each took place inside a German submarine.
The acting was nothing special, but in defense of the cast, the film wasn't really about the characters so they didn't have much to do except look tense.  The best performance was delivered by Harvey Keitel as Chief Klough, the old sea dog who held the crew together.  Matthew McConaughey was hollow and wooden.  This was not one of his better performances.

2484719,1,B000E1ZK5A,"Without doubt one of most rediculous and insulting films set in a historical backround I have ever seen. The fact that the script takes such HUGE liberties with real historical events the story line falls flat far too quickly. The amount of scrapes the crew get out of is just completely unbelievable. Whoever wrote the script was certainly digging in the bottom of the barrel for the next fantastic situation that the crew manages to get through, either by sheer luck or superhuman/superintelligent effort. Think about it, the US crew, whittled down to a third of it's original size successfully manage to control a foreign submarine and do a better job than it's own crew members did. Rubbish.  The acting, will not bad, betrays a sort of 'oh my god why am I doing this movie' type feeling. Everybody looks like their kind of cringing and certain aspects of the film are completely wasted in a movie as bad as this, like the model work, which was quite a good attempt to depict a type VII C U-boat.
 Now, movies, especially historical flicks ofen take liberties with truth or facts and generally these can be quite inconsequential, although annoying, like say ""Memphis Belle"" and the P51d's escorting the bombers in 1943 (when in actual fact they weren't around 'til 1944), but this does not significantly alter history and it certainly does not steal another countries soldiers brave efforts. But U-571 is incredibly insulting, not only to the British soldiers who took the enigma machine in the first place, but also to US servicemen, whos own heroic efforts are downplayed as a result of such mis-handling of true events. You've probably read which innacuracies are involved, elsewhere in these reviews, so I won't rehash them again.
 That gripe being aside, my main gripe is that all the ingredients were there for a truely gripping film. Forget the story (that can be re-written). But with the same model work, camera work, most of the cast, etc a different film entirely could have been made, perhaps based on the true American capture of their enigma in '44 or with British actors, the true account of the capture of the first enigma machine in the Atlantic. Or forget that, why not just make a film about the German crew trying to evade capture or death in their U-boat?

2484720,4,B000E1ZK5A,"The concept of masquerading as a German U-boat to ambush a stricken one is a good one, you'd think a German flag might work better than a tiny decal on the conning tower?
I have to disagree with most people about the submarine actions--does every submarine movie have to have:
1. Scene where sub goes to crush depth and survives 2. Crewman (or crewmen) who sacrifices self/selves to repair/save sub 3. Depth charge scene 4. Dive scene where someone is left on top
The best thing about the movie is how Lt. Tyler is not recommended for sub command by Bill Paxton's character, his bitterness and lack of understanding of it. Paxton explains why later he is not ready, that he lacks the strength to make the tough decisions in the seconds they require. Later on in the film, Tyler is pressed into command and his lack of command readiness almost kills everyone, but he learns so Paxton's CO was right. It would have been highly interesting if the film had Tyler hesitate and the sub get sunk, killing everyone right then and there..it would have made everyone in the audience think.....then rewind and have him make the split decision and they make it barely. Its too bad the movie chose to be more of an action movie and less of a leadership movie.
The next best scenes are when Keitel physically gets the other enlistedmen in line and then later chews out the flaky Tyler and tells him to take command or else. This is true to life in that the whip is often cracked by senior enlistedmen to deliver a subservient unit to officers who are spared the dirty details, but in the long run the military is not best served by keeping officers out of touch with reality. In a sub, officers are right in there with the men and stay close to reality, in other places, situations the disconnect between policy/reality widens and yet we wonder why our military is not all that it can be?",971654400,,1874,4.514705882352941

Still, not a bad pick up at the video store.",971395200,,433,4.493670886075949
2484722,4,B000E1ZK5A,"Some things in this film are not credible, for example:
- How skillfully the American crew, few in number, manages so quickly to run that crippled, alien German submarine so well after they capture it;
- How doggedly (miraculously?) that poor sub survives the depth charging it endured crippling it before the Americans arrive, and the even more murderous ones by the German destroyer afterward;
-  How could such a battered boat survive a dive well beyond the maximum depth on its depth gauge?  (Best line in the film is from the Chief Petty Officer played by Keitel: ""Those Krauts sure know how to build a boat."")
-  Watertight doors seem never to be closed.  That's the first thing you do when you go to battle stations on a warship.
Nonetheless, a good, fairly gripping effort.  The sounds of the depth chargings are awesome on a good subwoofer system such as mine.  I have never been depth charged for real, though have read numerous descriptions in submarine literature and seen movies such as Das Boot.  Take away the occasionally intrusive music and this sound track must be close to what I imagine was the real thing.  Depth charging has been described as a huge awesome hammer.  That effect comes through - not only huge loud deafening metallic hammer blows but the deep boom of the explosions and the click of the trigger just before the charges go off.  Hats off to the people on all sides who endured that for real.
One last note:  it would have been better, and more diplomatic, for the note acknowledging that the British were first in capturing an enigma machine to have come at the beginning of the film rather than the end.  Also, a notation at the beginning that the film was a fictional dramatization of actual events would have been appropriate and more respectful to British and Americans alike.",971308800,,1817,4.697160883280757

Matthew McConaughey was, as usual, brilliant as Lt. Andrew Tyler.  His character is firmly established within the first 20 minutes of the film.  The supporting cast was also great, including Bill Paxton as Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren.
My problem with this film was that the character development overshadowed the tension and action of this film.  I never felt the desperation that should have been established for recovering the Enigma box.  This was the plot device used, but it was not introduced well.  They needed to establish that the intelligence community had been trying unsuccessfully for months to crack the code.  This might have added something to the story.  Second, there could have been a lot more tension/action established throughout to give the viewer more of a feel of submarine warfare.  We only get a couple of looks at it; at the beginning and at the end of the film.  I thought there should have been at least one more scene, maybe one explaining submarine warfare at that period of time to the audience.
This was a decent drama.  I think it should be watched at least once.  However, if you're after a really good submarine movie, go check out THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.",971222400,,1347,4.700854700854701

The theatre trailers suggested to us that the American crew in the German sub (which ran pretty well and looked amazingly ship-shape inside for having been all shot up in the seizure of the Engima) had to get through Allied combatants to get back to safety.

The plot is weak and far too predictable, what passes for foreshadowing is so simplistic, a six-year-old recognizes it.  In addition, there are far too many unexplained incidents, the worst of which occurs early in the movie when the U-571 is disabled by depth charges from the British Navy, and the sub has no choice but to surface.

It had a star-studded cast, but no outstanding performances, not even by Harvey Keitel, one of the best actors around.  It captured the tight knit and claustrophobic lifestyle of living on a submarine, but it didn't have enough character development.  You didn't care what happened to the people in the film, thus lacked suspense.  It looked like a typical Hollywood film, which hurt it and it didn't have a terrific director like Wolfgang Peterson.  Although I liked the Moscow's first movie, Breakdown, it didn't have this Hollywood look and feel to it.  I think he had the right idea, but couldn't reach it with his film.

2484735,3,B000E1ZK5A,"Jonathan Mostow, who so successfully created an atmosphere of tension and suspense in Breakdown, does the same fine work here in U-571. In this film, Matthew McConaughey leads a team of naval officers to steal a German encoder known as the Enigma. They take over a German sub, and attempt to finish their mission, when major problems ensue. (don't want to give anything away)
The best part of this movie is the effects and the tension that it created within the submarine. The special effects are amazing, the camera work is terrific as you feel the dizzy, claustrophobic sense of tension aboard this ship. That being said, it's the type of movie where you only realize afterwards what was missing.
First, there are problems of historical accuracy: Although the end credits thank the real Navy efforts to steal the German encoders during the War, it was the British, and never the American Navy, who were involved. This isn't a terrible thing, but it's crediting the wrong people. There are a number of other plot holes as well.
Second is the acting. With several exceptions, most notably McConaghey's solid performance, there is some bad casting and dry acting. Harvey Keitel ? He is listed as Chief Klough, but then why does he report to McConaughey's Lt. Tyler ? Bill Paxton is wooden, and Erik Palladino whines through his role and is annoying.

Sadly, this proved to be true. Sure, it was well made, but aren't most movies these days? I found it boring, implausible and just plain bad. (Don't read further if you haven't seen it and want to decide for yourself) Certain elements of the plot (if this movie could be said to have one) are exaggerated, wrong, or unlikely. Firstly, we all know about the fact the the British were the first ever Allied troops to use a German sub to capture Enigma. The captions at the end of U-571 that reveal this fact, and many others, seems like an admission to failure if ever I saw one. Second, the badly damaged German sub commandeered by the Americans manages to sink a German destroyer: with one torpedo shot. Visual effects show the ship practically vaporizing in one second! Now, correct me If I'm wrong: but surely one torpedo would merely hole the ship, letting it sink slowly. Even if it hit a weapons magazine, I doubt the whole ship would blow up in so violent a manner. Also, the fact that the Germans even had a destroyer in the film is dubious: Germans never made wide use of Destroyers in WWII. And the fact that they just happen to have depth charges ready to deploy is unlikely: why would they need to attack Submarines, since they just about held the monopoly on Submarine Warfare in 1942. And the ship had a distncly un-warship like appearance: sort of dumpy like a converted trawler.

2484747,5,B000E1ZK5A,"These vessels -- manned by some of the bravest sailors in WWII-- were the backbone of Germany's naval campaigns.  During WWII, German U-Boats sank over 14 million tons worth of merchant men craft. They also sent 2 battleships and 3 aircraft carriers to Davey Jones's locker.  Why, even the English aircraft carrier, Royal Oak; which played a predominant role in sinking the Bismark, met its fate at the hands of a valiant U-Boat crew!  In his memoirs, Sir Winston Churchill even admitted that the U-Boat situation in the Atlantic Ocean greatly troubled him.
This is the back drop of this story.  In its 1942. German U-boats are reeking havoc in the Atlantic; thereby crippling the allied war efforts in Europe. England, an island nation, is on the verge of being starved out of the war.
To counter this enormous problem, the allies devise a scheme to capture a German decoding machine along with supporting documentation off a German submarine. This prize would give the allies an advantage; it would tell them where the German U-Boat wolfpacks were operating.  To capture one of these enigma machines, an elite submariner commando task force was assembled.  This commando task force accomplished its mission. Unfortunately, while executing the mission, their own submarine is torpedoed.  They now find themselves trapped on a German U-Boat -- where everything is in metrics and written in German.
This film gives you plenty of ""edge-of-your-seat"" suspense.  The allied crew now find themselves in a strange -- but very real -- ""parallel universe."" Enemy vessels are now ""friendly."" Allied vessels -- such as destroyers -- are now deadly adversaries.
I know that comparisons with the film ""Das Boat"" are inevitable.  However, please Don't get wrapped around that axle.  ""Das Boat"" is a great [anti-war] movie that accurately portrays life on board a German U-Boat during the latter years of WWII.  U-571 is not intended to be ""accurate"" or ""realistic."" It is intended to be a good, old-fashioned, suspense-filled WWII submarine flick -- which, it is.
This is a great action-suspense film that you'll enjoy.  There will definitely be no ""snooring"" during this film. Definitely worth watching more than once.
As an epilogue, many vessels in the German U-Boat fleet met with watery deaths.  After the allies captured the decoding machine, swift Hunter-Killer anti-submarine surface vessels found German submarines and sank them. By the end of the war, over half of the sailors that served on German U-Boats never made it back home.  This is worth remembering while watching this film.  END",966988800,,2586,5.109263657957245
2484748,5,B000E1ZK5A,"This is a movie you are compelled to watch. It pulls you in with its non-stop action and pulls you out of the ordinariness of today's world. It  is excellent storytelling, and it has 'dynamite' special effects, more cold  salt water than any other movie, good 'representative' characters for the  morality tale it is, and a thoughtful query of 'what' is leadership for the  main character. The director pays homage to the British by using the race  for subsequent capture of a later enigma machine as the catalyst of events  in this story. (If you read the credits, the list of those various,  predominantly British, crews who made enigma captures are given tribute.  Note that in truth this honored company includes 1 American group.) (Credit  is also given to the British admiral involved with the original enigma  capture who was a technical advisor for the movie.)This is a story that  grabs you. It reminds you 'how awful is war' (and how unrelenting to be  caught up in one), and that in impossible situations the good in  individuals is distilled and revealed. The more obvious struggle of Matthew  McC's character [is it better to be everybody's best pal and personal  advocate or to be able to make some tough, touchy decisions that could  cause disaster for some if not all?] Eric Palladino's (""Doctor  Dave"" from ER) character is used to great effect in pushing the  buttons that spotlight this. Jack Noseworthy illuminates his small, pivotal  role. Jon Bon Jovi makes you want to see more of what he can do. Dave  Power's tangible despair over being 'too big' for what he MUST get done  raps you right in the heart. And the German captain-- did he not exemplify  the determination to protect and preserve what was important to HIS  country?If you missed any of this by being too caught up in the nonstop  action, BUY THIS DVD AND WATCH IT AGAIN. These boys did a superb job of  giving honor to the sailors of that 'Greatest Generation', for whom combat  was still one on one. The dvd has some terrific additional features that you  will be glad to have. More than that, buy this for the totally engrossing,  heartstopping rollercoaster of a good 'old fashioned' war story.",966902400,,2184,4.736702127659575
2484749,3,B000E1ZK5A,"I am a huge fan of World War II movies and damn near have everything ever made, from the Sands of Iwo Jima to Saving Private Ryan, and while I  enjoyed U571, it seemed to hollywood to be considered a great movie. While  the interactions and chain of command descions by the crew was top notch,  it lacked the intensity and in-depth characterization that the great WWII  movies possess. We could all feel for Patton as he stormed through Italy,  we all wanted Prv. Ryan to come home safely, and in this movie, I was shown  more explosions and action than actual in-depth character appeal, which is  the real strength of a WWII movie, to humanize war.
If you are looking  for a seriously good World War II movie based on submarines, look no  further than DAS BOOT, directed by Wolfgang Petersen. The level of  intensity is insane as I was stuck to the edge of my seat for the majority  of the movie and its best factor is that it humanizes an entire crew. We  feel that we are there with them, through their pain and triumph.
Nice  try Hollywood but i'm not buying this one as great!",966816000,,1081,4.371859296482412
2484750,3,B000E1ZK5A,"I think a European's opinion is needed here. While the film is rather entertaining, it's a complete piece of Hollywood fantasy and is selling  Americans as doing things they never did! The British actually got hold of  the device by the way! I have no problem with Hollywood indulging in  fantasies. But younger audiences are going to believe films like this as  being ""fact"" and THAT'S really sad!",966729600,,398,4.8088235294117645
2484751,1,B000E1ZK5A,Even though it has quite a good cast and the acting is good the exeution of the film is just not well done. During the submarine scene the sub that  the americans are on just keeps getting depth charged and depth charged and  depth charged. If your into this type of stuff rent it but otherwise you  might just leave it alone.,966384000,,326,4.225806451612903
2484752,4,B000E1ZK5A,"""U-571"" is a fairly well thought out, well acted and scripted movie.  It's quite gripping and has plenty of action but also explores the  human side of submarines.  If you have seen the classic Wolfgang Petersen  film ""Das Boot,"" the based upon a true story of a German U-boat  in WWII during a war patrol and the trials and tribulations the crew  experiences while underway, you will more than likely enjoy  ""U-571.""  Highly recommended, even if the historical points are  quite flawed.  On an up note, at the final credits, the director does give  credit where credit is due and names the submarines, both British and  American, that actually did capture the Enigma devices, which was a turning  point in the Atlantic battle against the German U-boat fleet.",966297600,,759,4.8359375
2484753,1,B000E1ZK5A,"Sorry, I just can't enjoy a film that messes with history to the extent that this title does. The mission in the film was nothing to do with the US  - those were BRITISH sailors risking their lives to capture the coding  machine, some years before America even joined WW2!
As a Brit myself, I  find this re-writing of history to be in extreme bad taste! I mean, what if  we Brits released a film portraying the moon landings as a British mission,  with a Brit playing Neil Armstrong! You get my point, I'm sure.",966124800,,511,4.336842105263158
2484754,4,B000E1ZK5A,"I am anxiously awaiting the DVD release of the relentlessly suspenseful WWII Submarine Adventure, U-571.  I saw this film in theaters, and have  since decided that it is one of the greatest adventure films of recent  years.  The performances are exeptional and loyal to their era.  The  charcters are multi-dimensional, and the suspense is nearly unbearable.
Sound plays an unusually key role in the full enjoyment of this movie,  and the DVD release of this film should prove a worthy addition to the  collection of Dolby Digital enthusiaists.  The scenes involving the  depth-charges in particular rely heavily on the use of rear speakers for  full dramatic effect, and with the a good sound system, should improve the  intensity of these nail-biting moments tenfold.",965952000,,769,5.162601626016261
2484755,5,B000E1ZK5A,"Jeez, what can you really say about this movie? I was told advance word on  this was fantastic.  Every person I knew had seen an advance screening of  it assured me that it was a brilliant film, and they were dead right. U-571  tells the story of an American manned submarine on it's way to retrieve the  Engima message coding device from the nazis. One of the nazi subs with this  machine on it, has just been attacked & disabled.  Through a  intercepted message to Germany, the Americans pinpoint the location, &  head out to pick up the machine. Suffice to say, things do not go to plan,  and the American crew, near obliterated by nazi fire, are stranded on the  enemy sub, where everything is written in german, and no way to get back  home, without coming under fire from their own men. Matthew McConaughey is  brilliant in this movie, a true action hero.  It really makes you wonder  why he isn't used more in this type of film. Bill Paxton - I've been a big  fan of his for a long time, and it's a shame that he isn't used as much as  he could be here.  But that said, what he does do is worth watching. Harvey  Keitel - Looking like Mario from Super Mario Bros., Keitel as always does a  great job.

2484756,4,B000E1ZK5A,"This movie, which features some nifty, surprising and explosive war-time effects involving WWII submarines, has an old-fashioned heart and style;  it's a throwback to the testosterone, military-themed movies that sprang up  during/after WWII.  While Matthew M. is not especially effective with his  leading role, the rest of the cast is superb, and the thrills are gigantic,  the suspense truly terrifying and deafening.  This movie should have made a  much bigger splash, if you will, during its recent theatrical release -- it  is heads and tails better thanmost action thrillers, and creates a tension  and mood with a tight, engrossing story.",965865600,,646,5.38
