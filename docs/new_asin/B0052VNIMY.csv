8454497,3,B0052VNIMY,"We bought this very excited, the case said 125 minutes. We thought- feature film. Because it says ""like a feature film"" on the case. But it is really quite a short documentary. It was nicely done, although Martin Sheen would not be my choice for a narrator. The footage was good, and the story is a wonderful one, obviously. But they need to fix their facts so you are not let down expecting a full-length film and getting essentially something short enough to be shown in a museum exhibit.",1398297600,2,490,4.51685393258427
