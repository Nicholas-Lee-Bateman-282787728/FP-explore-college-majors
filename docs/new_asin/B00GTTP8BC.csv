8627475,5,B00GTTP8BC,"What a bargain! This is a *lot* of movies. And admittedly, ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" is campy and ridiculous, but was still fun to watch. I mean, it's a Vincent Price collection - you know what a fancy old queen he was! Just enjoy it :-) This is the best collection of VP movies on Amazon and *easily* worth the price.",1417651200,5,330,4.253968253968254

8627478,5,B00GTTP8BC,"Vincent Price: The Ultimate Collection is a must have for any true Vincent Price collector.  If you are new to Vincent Price then this is a great way to start your collection on the fast track.  In this collection you have some of the best horror work done by Vincent Price.  The Vincent Price body of work is so vast no single collection will likely have it all since he worked for many studios over time.  This collection is a great start for those who want to know the true meaning of Horror in a movie.  Yes these movies are not full of CGI special effects and animatronics but if you have any imagination at all that will be all you need to get a nice fright.

The key to watching a Vincent Price horror picture is to dwell more on the people and their motives than the special effects.  Many times the horror in a vincent price flick centers around rich people behaving badly.  People used, abused and cast away like rubbish only to seek sweet sweet revenge.  I could go on to write spoilers here but I will resist the temptation.  Vincent Price should be discovered in his full glory without preparation of any kind.  There is another Vincent Price horror movie that I would suggest people get named ""The Tingler"" no movie ever creeped me out more with the possible exception of House On Haunted Hill.

Speaking of House on Haunted Hill, the exterior shots used for House On Haunted Hill are actually of a real house.  Thanks to

The House On Haunted Hill Exterior is actually the The Ennis House a real mansion in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.  The house is located south of Griffith Park. This house was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for Charles and Mabel Ennis.  the house designs were complete in 1923.  The house was built in 1924.  For its time the house was very unique and mordern it is still unique to this day.  The house is in poor condition and is being restored at great cost.  In the movie House on Haunted Hill you see the exterior of the house by stormy night so you don't get a real sense of how creepy this house is to look at.  Go online and see pictures of the Ennis House by day and you will see that even seen in full daylight this house is still creepy like walking around in an old pyramid, tomb or something equally errie.

Each of these Vincent Price Movies has its own special creep factor which makes this collection worth owning and worth viewing.  best of all Vincent Price was a very nice man as well.  he was as nice as he was creepy and brother was Vincent Price CREEPY!  I must give Vincent Price my thanks because he made some of my childhood awesome and unforgettable with the movies in this collection.",1407456000,16,2672,4.393075356415479

8627481,3,B00GTTP8BC,"Got this for my wife's birthday. Video quality on some of the films leaves a bit to be desired, and I could do without those campy comedies that were included, but overall it's pretty decent, you do get a lot I films for a goo price and they do emcompass his whole career. Love the box art too.",1403308800,15,294,4.086206896551724
