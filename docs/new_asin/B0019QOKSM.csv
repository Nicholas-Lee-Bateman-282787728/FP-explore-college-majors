3443134,5,B0019QOKSM,"The BBC and Masterpiece Theater's long running Inspector Lynley series has produced its sixth and possibly last installment.  Nathaniel Parker returns as aristocratic Inspector Lynley and Sharon Small as working class Detective Sergeant Havers.

This installment contains two episodes.  In the first, ""Limbo"", Inspector Lynley, still grieving from a personal loss (see Set Five) is dragged into a mystery involving the prior disappearence of his godson.  Lynley's efforts to help the family deal with new police evidence ends up enmeshing him in the case as a suspect when the missing boy's sister dies on the street in front of Lynley's temporary residence.  Lynley must rely on Sergeant Havers to run down the evidence that will keep him out of jail long enough to solve both cases.  Havers herself will be in desperate need of assistance by the time the murderer is identified.  The second case,""Know Thine Enemy"", involves the murder of a young girl and the potential threat to an additional victim.  Lynley and Havers must sort through the clues under considerable time duress to try to save the living.  The two will also have to resolve a major difference of opinion over who the real murderer or murderers are.

The heart of this series is still the relationship between Lynley and Havers, who have complemented each other in increasingly nuanced ways over the years.  This viewer hopes BBC won't let Set Six be the end of their partnership.  ""The Inspector Lynley Mysteries Set Six"" is very highly recommended to fans of this well-done series.",1218672000,63,1552,5.043137254901961
3443135,5,B0019QOKSM,"I mentioned when writing about season five that this delicately etched and excellently acted series on PBS's ""Mystery"" was my favorite. It still is. I truly believe it is the finest show on television. Nathaniel Parker's Inspector Thomas Lynley and Sharon Small's Barbara Havers are eagerly awaited with passion each season by this viewer like nothing else on television.

Based on Elizabeth George's characters, the BBC show has grown and matured into something really special. The mysteries are always well-written and the lead characters have been allowed to let life and what each brings to the table change both themselves and how they view each other. Parker and Small are a fabulous duo who balance each other out.

The dashing Lynley was originally paired with Havers because it was taken for granted he would not be distracted by her in a romantic way. But the two quickly found there was more to each other than their reputations, and proved a great team. They also became quite close, their deep friendship and affection for each other rarely dwelled upon but always there beneath the surface.

Havers has given the dashing Lynley depth and complexity while he has given her a softer appearance over time. Small really looked terrific in season five with her hair down. Though some griped it was a deviation from the books, it is this intelligent lack of stagnation which has kept things fresh.

Season five ended tragically as Lynley's world changed in the blink of an eye when his beloved Helen was killed. One of the most poignant moments of the series found Havers sitting with Lynley after her funeral to make the world wait a few moments. It is intelligent and very real moments such as that which make this show tower head and shoulders above everything else out there.

It is for that reason that a massive campaign is being waged to persuade the BBC to continue to produce the show so that PBS fans in America can enjoy these richly mature and intelligent mysteries. The carefully nuanced performances of Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small as Lynley and Havers would be harder to live without than Lynley's beloved Bristol.

Until that happens, we can at least enjoy the two episodes here on season six. In ""Limbo,"" first aired in Australia, the remains of Lynley's godson are discovered twelve years after he was reported missing. Lynley becomes deeply involved with the deceased's sister and will become the prime suspect in a second murder. In ""Know Thine Enemy"" one young schoolgirl kills herself to escape captivity and Lynley and Havers try to find another before tragedy strikes twice.

The Inspector Lynley series is smart and atmospheric, Debbie Wiseman's opening music setting the tone for each intriguing installment. Fans cherish this show and hopefully this won't be the last we see of our favorite detectives.",1212624000,218,2842,4.945492662473795

3443148,4,B0019QOKSM,"Likes:  I loved the Elizabeth George books.  And I especially like Sharon Small in this role.  She is totally believable and true to the nature of the character as written.

Not so sure:  Not sure Nathaniel Parker was the right casting for this part.  He has the aristocratic aura down to a tee.  But, unlike the books, he comes across here as a little snotty, like a whiny brat a lot of the time.  I noticed this throughout the series, but especially toward the end.

Additionally, the series worked best when based on the stories actually written by Elizabeth George.

That said, it is still far and away superior to most of what is aired on US networks -- well-acted and intelligently written.",1389225600,2,696,4.585365853658536

3443153,5,B0019QOKSM,"Another fantastic detective series from the UK. Unfortunately (as with so many good things) it had to end.

The thought of an hereditary Earl being a police officer for the Met initially struck me as a bit strange. However, the cast did a magnificent job of making it incredibly entertaining and well worth the watch (I will say that I have not read the books). Great job- well worth the watch!",1370044800,,394,4.549295774647887

different types who mesh as a team.  They cared about one another.  The story lines were well done.  I found the last
episode most interesting.  It seems that most series have ""an ending"" that resolves everything. This one finishes as though
the two will be having another case in the future.  They are content with one another.  I rather liked that.  I'll miss seeing them

3443163,3,B0019QOKSM,"This series is one of my favorite British shows, but this last DVD doesn't live up to the previous episodes. It is enjoyable and entertaining. The first episode, Limbo is the better of the two. The latter episode is a letdown, for me anyway: in viewing this one, I understand why the series wasn't renewed for more episodes. Instead of working together, Havers and Lynley work more against each other in this one. For the price, you only get two episodes here, instead of the usual four, so the purchase is up to you.",1319587200,,517,4.51063829787234
3443164,5,B0019QOKSM,"I only discovered the Inspector Lynley mysteries several weeks ago, but as soon as I watched the first episode I was hooked! The writing on this series is intelligent, with well-crafted, credible plots, and superior acting by the main characters, DI Thomas Lynley (played by Nathaniel Parker) and DS Barbara Havers (Sharon Small) and also the supporting actors. Each hour and a half episode is paced just right, with enough tension and red herrings to keep a crime drama fan enthralled.

This last series only has two episodes on it, i.e. Limbo and Know Thine Enemy. Both are some of the best writing and acting I've seen on this series, and I just don't understand why the producers did not continue with this excellent series. Was it a question of budget constraints or the lack of additional storylines? It is hard for me to accept either because there are too many inferior shows out there that are still being continued, and given the great track record of this series in terms of acting and writing, I imagine it would not be difficult to attract top-notch writers. Anyway, it is a pity to see such a wonderful, intelligent crime series end.

Nathaniel Parker plays a tormented, grieving Lynley to the hilt in Limbo, which deals with an old crime that is soon revealed to be a murder, and Lynley gets into trouble with the law when an indiscreet affair lands him as a prime suspect in a crime. It is up to Havers to help him out and Lynley races against time to clear his name. In the sinister Know Thine Enemy, the body of a schoolgirl is found in a lake, and soon revealed to be a murder. Then a second schoolgirl turns up missing, and Lynley and Havers soon realize that they have a potential serial killer on their hands. This episode is truly chilling, and it finally dawned on me that the plot was inspired by the real life case of Carla Homolka. The acting and pacing of this episode was one of the best I've seen in a crime drama in a long while.

Lynley and Havers will be missed, and I hope at some point they'll be brought back (the original cast) in a special or TV movie.",1317513600,,2090,4.465968586387435
3443165,5,B0019QOKSM,"I was so disappointed that the Insp. Lynley series came to an end, although I assume Ms. George will continue to write. I have the entire DVD series and rewatch them often. Excellent casting and good plots. I prefer the characters reimagined for the TV series over those created by the author--Lynley should not be blonde, and Havers should not be unattractive! Maybe if I had read the books before seeing the TV version I might have a different opinion. Anyway...highly recommend all things 'Lynley'(books & DVD).",1306886400,3,514,4.919540229885057
3443166,5,B0019QOKSM,"The two episodes in this season of the show are particularly good. They are in marked contrast to Season 5, in which the actress playing Helen changed and her personality also changed -- for the worse. Lynley seemed at times to become an infatuated teenager -- it was not a believable side of his personality. The only thing about this season that I found irritating is that there wasn't some acknowledgement of the end of the series. The second episode just ended, an excellent one, to be sure, but with no resolution of the tension between the characters. Perhaps they're hoping to continue, do specials, or make a movie. Loved the series!",1298764800,5,641,4.732142857142857

3443182,5,B0019QOKSM,"This 6th in the Inspector Linley Mystery series is excellent mysteries in its presentation, plot, dialogue and under-current issues. The portrayed relationship between the two main characters keeps a certain personal tension, as well as a tension with the Scotland Yard politics. The plot indicates the intricancies of the attempts to solve a crime to charge the correct perpetrator--who has woven a web of covertness. Highly recommended whether the first or as part of the continuing series from the beginning.",1222646400,,511,5.4
3443183,5,B0019QOKSM,"I have long been a fan of Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley series, and when the BBC series based on it came out, I watched every one of them. Nathaniel Parker played the inspector to the hilt; I was impressed not only with his portrayal of Lynley's genius as a detective, but also with his hypersensitivity, hangups, and insecurities. Sharon Small was the perfect Barbara Havers, another fish out of water where society is concerned, but also a skilled detective. Both characters had to deal with family problems, and neither of them, at least in the first series, had much success with romance. In short, the characters are beautifully human, and the actors did a great job of portraying them.

This series was no exception. Elizabeth George's books are rather long for mystery novels (which I like, because I read fast), and the stories, therefore, had to be edited. However, neither plot nor character suffered from that. The shows were fast-paced and intriguing, and even though I'd read most of the books they were based on, I never once got off the edge of my chair. And now they say that this will be the last Inspector Lynley series? I sure hope not! If so, this will be a major loss to British mystery.",1222646400,2,1214,4.699530516431925
3443184,4,B0019QOKSM,"I would have reviewed every other series of the Inspector Lynley Mysteries by giving them five stars. I think this one is more disappointing for two reasons; the BBC clearly took an abrupt decision to end the series, and the suddenness of that decision can be felt in the unsatisfactory last scene of the final episode [of the two, I much prefer 'Limbo', despite some plot inconsistencies]. The scriptwriting, especially in the final episode, is poor, and I think the story was based largely on a real crime. Lynley's language and behaviour have changed so totally from previous episodes that he reminds me of an ill-bred thug rather than a well-bred aristocrat. I found myself wondering if the scriptwriter had read the books at all.

I still give it four stars because of the quality of the acting of Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small. Even given a badly-written script they did a superb job as they have done throughout. Their partnership [both in character and as actors] is one of the most compellingly fascinating I have ever seen on TV.",1221523200,28,1043,4.794444444444444
3443185,4,B0019QOKSM,"The 6th and final series of the ""Inspector Lynley Mysteries"" picks up after the sudden death of Inspector Lynley's wife Helen, and it continues the tone and look of the previous series. These episodes are written by Ed Whitman based on characters from Elizabeth George's ""Inspector Lynley"" novels. I found this series a bit over-the-top, with more than the usual stretch of credibility in the behavior of the villains. I can't deny that the episodes are entertaining, though. Fans don't get a grand finale but probably won't be disappointed either. This was called Series 7 on PBS, but it is sold as Series 6, because the Pilot episode is not being counted as a series. There are only 2 episodes in this final series, 85 minutes each, on 2 discs.

""Limbo"" finds DI Lynley (Nathaniel Parker) consoling himself with the bottle 6 months after the death of his wife, while partner DS Havers (Sharon Small) isn't having much success in discouraging his drinking. Lynley is startled out of his grief by the discovery of the remains of young Justin Oborne, the son of friends who disappeared on his 5th birthday, 15 years ago. Lynley travels to Rome to convince the Obornes' estranged daughter Julia (Georgina Rylance) to return to England for Justin's funeral. But that effort takes a dangerous turn when Julia's apartment is burgled and Lynley is accused of murder by a ferocious Detective Superintendent Tate (Geraldine Somerville). Lynley and Havers race to solve both old and new mysteries, with the help of forensic pathologist Lafferty (Paul Hickey), before accusations against Lynley turn into charges.

Teenaged Sarah Middleton is found dead after having disappeared on her way home from school two weeks before in ""Know Thine Enemy"". When another teenager, Kelly Stevens (Eleanor Gecks), disappears, it starts a serial killer scare. With the pressure on, Lynley, Havers, and DC Ed Harvey (Mark Bonnar) set out to find the red-haired woman whom witnesses placed at the scene of both women's disappearances. That leads to Tania Thompson (Honeysuckle Weeks), whose ambitious and abusive husband Guy (James D'Arcy) makes him the perfect suspect. But Havers and Lynley disagree over Tania's role in the crimes. This episode revolves around sex crimes that are hardly believable, and the investigation proceeds in a fashion no more credible.",1221004800,5,2338,5.117801047120419
8275002,4,B0019QOKSM,"I had high expectations for this series, as I love the Elizabeth George books. The main characters (all four of them) are all engaging and interesting. That said, by and large I come away from the TV series disappointed. I agree with other commenters that Sharon Small pretty much nailed the Barbara Havers character. But as other commenters also stated, Nathanial Parker didn't quite grasp the subtleties and grace of Lynley.

Additionally, aside from the first episode, the series sadly omitted Deborah and St. James (both of whom seemed miscast to me). More importantly, after three tries the producers and writers failed miserably with the Helen character, who in the books was elegant, articulate, beautiful, and talented (and more even tempered).

I agree with another commenter that the series went off the rails once the writers no longer attempted to follow the books. The sixth installment went completely over a cliff and I stopped watching when Lynley was arrested. Actually his actions leading up to his arrest were completely out of character for the book version of Lynley I remember.",1518480000,,1099,5.1
