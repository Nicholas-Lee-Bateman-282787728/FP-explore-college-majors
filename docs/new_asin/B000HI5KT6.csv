8139757,5,B000HI5KT6,"I think this has been Rob's most controversial nooma to date. If you google ""bullhorn man"" or ""bullhorn guy"" you will find a lot of backlash to this. I believe a lot of people started labeling Rob as a an emergent at this point and started making all of these wild claims that Rob doesn't understand ""street evangelism"" or ""street preaching"" or that he fails to communicate the reality of sin.

blah blah blah

Critics who totally missed what Rob was trying to say. I even tried this once. I preached a message against tracks and street preaching - but my point wasn't that these things are ""bad"" my point [as I think was one of Rob's points as well] it's just that these methods are not the best. And if we aren't giving God our best, why are we doing it?

Personally, standing on a soap box with a megaphone is easy. Standing on a corner passing out tracks - or worse - leaving them for your waitress...is easy. You people are putting in 10% or a very minimal amount of energy to save lost people. Shouting through a bullhorn or handing out pamphlets is just the same thing as casting a huge net and seeing what you catch. You're doing the biggest thing you can think of, and you don't care what you catch, so long as you catch something. No, this is not what I see Jesus doing - Jesus taught outside because that was customary, it was not a strange thing to see street teachers. Today in 2009 - it is strange. This is not where our teachers hang out.

Jesus was also popular, people WANTED to hear him teach. Very different ...

Jesus also preached a message of love and hope. Show me where Jesus condemned people and threatened hell fire to passers by. [oh wait, he DID do that, but it was directed to Church goers! Burn!]

The reason why this style of evangelism is not effective is  because it isn't personal. And if Jesus was anything, he was personal. Count the amount of times he preached to the crowds to the amount of stories where he ate with people, touched people, spoke privately to people and I think you will start to catch on.

Personal evangelism takes time, it takes an investment. You have to roll your sleeves up, get to know people, learn their names, cry with them, hold them... I know it's hard work. It's much easier to stand on a box and yell at strangers...

But what story are you telling people?

That they are lost, broken, sinners in need of repentance? That if they don't make a decision for Jesus they will burn in hell for all eternity? Let me ask you... is THAT the ""good news?"" Because it doesn't sound very good to me. What is so exciting about that? I never read in scripture, some person running off to tell their neighbors... ""We have found the Messiah and he says if we don't pray and accept him into our hearts, then we will live in fire in the afterlife, come quick!""

Isn't the good news of the bible that, the creator of the universe loves us - regardless of our condition? You don't need to tell people that they are broken, people aren't stupid, they know it already. Jesus said, ""come to me all who are weary and over burdened and I will give you rest.""

Jesus said, ""neither do I condemn you...""

Jesus said, ""it is not the healthy who need a Dr. but the sick.""

Jesus said, ""Simon, do you see this woman?""

Jesus saw people - not numbers. He came to heal the sick, not convert the sinners. Jesus came to lift heavy lifestyles and over taxing expectations off of the backs of the poor and to set them free.

The whole story of the bible is about setting people free.

You want to stand on the corner with a message to shout - shout that message.",1252627200,3,3595,4.317979197622585
