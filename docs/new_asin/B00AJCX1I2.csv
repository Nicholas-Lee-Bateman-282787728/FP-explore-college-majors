5440188,5,B00AJCX1I2,"I am an old fan of John Wayne .  I thought I had seen all of his movies, but there were a lot of the earlier ones that I missed.  This is a good collection and that is what I wanted.  When you order these, you have to remember when they were made.  One can not expect them to be the same as the DVDs of today.  That said, I got exactly what I wanted and am thoroughly loving them.  John Wayne can live on in my memory for years to come.  I am  quite satisfied.",1525046400,,460,3.71875

5440193,5,B00AJCX1I2,"Some of his best work. Since he did over 200 movies it is hard to pick but it is nice to have some of his movies combined in a collection. Saw all movies in one night or rather in 24 hours, my OCD. Western movies are hard to make in real quality, there are few actors who actually made outstanding movies just by there abilities. To act, to produce and to direct. He is what they call a natural in front of a camera. Watch some really bad westerns and then watch John Wayne's movies, including many 1 hour shows. You'll see the difference in quality of acting.",1521590400,3,560,4.194444444444445

5440196,5,B00AJCX1I2,"For our purposes we must have cc (subtitles) and they're at times surprisingly hard to find. I've ordered newer series and films that you'd think would automatically have that feature only to be disappointed.

That said, this collection is absolutely a bargain. The quality is quite good and the digitization has been done very well. Of course it's the Duke so the movies (with the exception of Rio Lobo imo) are like comfort food and bring a smile to your face like meeting an old friend after many years.",1513468800,,506,4.685393258426966

5440226,5,B00AJCX1I2,"I bought this mainly to get The Shootist. I already had the Sons of Katie Elder.  I did not have The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance so I went ahead and bit the bullet and ordered. I love The Shootist and the other two movies are keepers if you are a fan of John Wayne. I was dissapointed that I could not buy The Shootist on it's own, but that is life sometimes. I'm a fan and I had to have The Shootist. John Wayne is a lot like John Travolta in that early in their careers, neither one of them could act well enough to make the cut in a high school play but they came into their own over their careers and ended up being first class actors. It bothered me a lot when John Wayne passed away and I wish he would have lasted some more years and made a few more movies. He was genius in The Shootist, having come into his own many years before the making of the movie. One can only imagine how good his next couple of movies may have been. RIP John, you are gone but never forgotten!",1420329600,6,979,3.969543147208122
