8761157,1,B01FOU5J8S,"Progressive propaganda. We watched a roomful of Liberals cheer and laugh as faux Paine whined for an hour at a public library in Warwick, NY. They re-molded him into their image as a social justice warrior, waltzing past the truth of his delusion. Reason, above God, wheeled the guillotine into the public square in France turning their revolution into a national Godless bloodbath tragedy! America, on the other hand put God above the reasoning of man and his flawed nature. The rest is history.",1509148800,,496,4.916666666666667
8761158,5,B01FOU5J8S,This is a wonderful one man show that convincingly captures the spirit of Thomas Paine and makes his work more accessible from a modern perspective.,1501632000,2,148,4.96
8761159,5,B01FOU5J8S,"One of the most thought-provoking, relevant and deeply moving portrayals, by Ian Ruskin, of Thomas Paine whose thoughts in the 18th Century were elemental in the foundations of America and of political discourse ever since. Not to be missed, especially by any serious student of government, history and politics, as well as of philosophy in general.",1501459200,3,349,5.25
8761160,5,B01FOU5J8S,"After watching a shorter version on PBS, I had to get this.  I do not know how I never really read any of T. Paine's' works but it is never too late!",1499644800,2,149,3.65625
8761161,5,B01FOU5J8S,"This is a superb work, both in its powerful performance by Ian Ruskin, who brings Thomas Paine to passionate life, and in its presentation of the man who did so much to create & champion the still-unrealized dream of a just & exemplary America. Anyone who knows even a little bit about Paine understands that he truly deserves pride of place among the Founding Fathers ... and yet he was never granted that place, and was in fact denigrated, defamed, and nearly forgotten even within his own lifetime.

Why?

Because when he spoke of democratic ideals, he actually meant them -- not merely as vague hopes for a future conveniently generations away, but here & now. He wanted the vote for all, men & women, white & black; he wanted an end to slavery; he wanted Native Americans to have a permanent place in the halls of government, as full citizens; he wanted a fair & humane country that ensured no one would go hungry, unhoused, uneducated. If his hopes were undercut then, they've been all but abandoned today & would undoubtedly be called un-American by far too many -- oh, cruel irony!

But his life isn't simply about politics or policy. It's about personal integrity --  walking the walk & not just talking the talk. If we needed him & his humane ideals then, we need them just as much now, perhaps even more urgently. If anyone wants to know what America is supposed to be at its best, this film is the perfect starting point. Deeply moving, often humorous in the midst of being quite serious, warm & thoughtful -- most highly recommended!",1499472000,4,1546,4.610909090909091

8761163,5,B01FOU5J8S,"This is an outstanding, thought provoking and inspiring film! Ian Ruskin does such a great job of portraying Thomas Paine, after watching the film I felt like I had just spent quality time visiting with Thomas Paine himself.

As a Deist I couldn't be happier that this film makes clear that Thomas Paine was not a Christian and not an Atheist, but that he was a sincere Deist (he believed in God based on the application of his reason on the laws and designs in the Universe and Nature). It's surprising how few people know what Deism is when many of America's key founders were Deists and many of the key figures in the European Enlightenment were Deists.

I highly recommend this wonderful film to everyone!",1469404800,8,709,4.619047619047619

I was lucky enough to see this on a local PBS station and wanted to watch it again immediately and share it with others. The perfect film to see in this election year. Mr. Ruskin is inspiring to watch, he becomes Thomas Paine before our eyes. I learned much about the beginnings of our country, and how his words helped to shape it. Would that our founding fathers listened to more of what he said in writing our constitution. The New Deal is based on Paine's Agrarian Justice. So eager to have an election year party and get discussion going among my friends. It was filmed by Oscar winner Haskell Wexler, one of my favorite cinematographers. Loved the music, the imagery, and am eager to see the special features on this DVD.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Begin-the-World-Over-Again-the-Life-of-Thomas-Paine/dp/B01FOU5J8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Begin the World Over Again: the Life of Thomas Paine</a>",1468022400,5,981,5.590604026845638
