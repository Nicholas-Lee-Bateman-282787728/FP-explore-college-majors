69033,5,0783243499,"I was quite impressed with this film.  Namely with the fact Christian Bale conveys such a visciousness that if you were ever to encounter him in person you would never look at rich, wealthy, yuppie types the same way  again.  The thing that makes this film so much fun to watch is the fusion  of 80's nostalgia and raw carnage being displayed with such creativity.  I  imagine the forthcoming DVD will have deleted scenes that weren't used in  the initial film making the experience even more surreal.  What is so  impressive is how the director makes the mood so pasty and drab looking.  Every scene has this dark sensibility but most of the time you are  presented with daytime overcast skies, white walls and classic 80's  artwork. The sets make Batemans character seem so friendly but so  incredibly frightening too.  You leave the film thinking about all the  people you know in your life that could possibly have similar defects.  This film is definately a winner and sure to be the Christian Bale breakout  performance people will remember him for.",961891200,,1055,4.772222222222222
69034,3,0783243499,"I lump this movie in with others so weird and twisted(Natural Born Killers, Fight Club, Seven), that I can't bring myself to say I loved, but was worth seeing. Mary Harron (director, co-writer) did a good job of  making Ellis' book watchable, and the subtle pokes at the 80's Wall Street  mentality were funny. Bale was great(he usually is) playing the darkest  character he's ever tackled. The three-way scene which was cut for US  audiences is actually very funny in a oh-my-is he-really-doing this? kind  of way. Then, people die.  The ending seemed non-eventful, but that stems  from the book. Although several plot points are dropped from the transition  from book-to-film, the basic story structure remains the same. The climax  toyed with our expectations of the bad guy being punished at the end.  (would they catch him? what happened to the carnage he created?) Patrick  was the most poorly behaved character in the cast, but perhaps the point of  the movie was that they (the 80's) were an evil time, and Bale's character  was simply doing what everyone else was afraid to. If graphic violence and  sexual behavior gross you out, then avoid this movie. If they don't, watch  this movie, and look beyond it's graphic nature, and enjoy it for the  social satire. The book is rife with misogynistic scenes; the screenplay  written by two women shows that the real fools of the story are the men,  greedy in their newfound wealth and expensive suits. They're merely  insecure boys with big toys. I still feel that this story could've been  told differently;  the film as it is is a good one. I'd take this over the  latest Freddie Prinze movie anyday.",961891200,5,1657,4.801418439716312

Even when the  whole damn  movie made no sence to me i still loved it because of the great  directing, cinimatography, and wonderfully placed 80s pop music.  It  is about a young executive that basicly just sits around his office doing  nothing, and getting paid millions. Now, being a young man, with all this  free time, and tons of money what is a young man to do? Some might say,  ""get laid,"" ""do lots of drugs,"" ""and enjoy all the  finer things in life."" But Pat Baitman has done all that and is still  not pleased, so he trys some more savage and less normal ways of having a  good time and filling something in him witch has been burning for a very  long time.

Christian Bale has obviously been pumping a LOT of iron:  when you see his nude scenes, you'll never believe this was the same skinny kid from ""Empire Of The Sun.""  And his  ""American"" accent is perfect, almost better than his last  ""New York accent"" role in Newsies!  I think this movie was meant  to be a black comedy: the lifestyle of the rich-and-famous is satired  really well.  Look for the scene where they're comparing their business  cards: it's really funny!  Jared Leto is in this film, but has only  a  short role (too bad).  Hey, Willem Dafoe is here, too!

69046,4,0783243499,"Psychopathy in the super yuppie 1980s financial district, where a wolf in sheep's clothing runs rampant through the sea of fake grins and phony networking events. Christian Bale really made his name as a leading man in the role of Patrick Bateman, a move that looks bold and prescient in hindsight as many warned it would be career suicide. He's the motor behind this story, on-screen for basically the duration, and able to balance scenes of dark, black humor with later episodes that require him to come completely unhinged. The first hour is unspeakably funny, engulfing us in Bateman's daily ritual and knee-jerk lust for violence, in the masks he wears to pass muster and the hopelessly superficial jerks he hangs around with. It's absolutely loaded with classic scenes and quotable lines, like ""Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?"", ""Don't just stare at it, eat it"" and ""My god, it's even got a watermark"" and I could joyfully revisit any one of those snippets at the drop of a hat. Every time we start to think it's okay to cheer the serial killer, though, he pulls a blood-chilling stunt that makes us question our own judgment. As the film unfolds, he grows increasingly sloppy, desperately chasing the dragon until he's in so deep that there seems to be no escape. The climax is a big tonal swing, and though it flirts with the idea of a wild twist at the very end, a lot is left to the viewer and I don't think it completely arrives where it means to. Still, it's a relentlessly entertaining movie that toys with a broad range of emotions and gives us one of the decade's most memorable performances. I could watch this just about any time.",1520640000,,1652,4.622448979591836

Christian Bale is the serial killer and main character. His acting was so over the top at times his manner resembled the joker from the Batman series.  But it's surreal just how deftly his character -a Manhattan investment banker- used intimidation alternated with niceness and deflection to get his way.  He kills numerous victims based on his view that they are losers--prostitutes,  homeless,  pets,  the vulnerable and weak-- each time they are completely unaware he is a serial killer until it is too late.  The one character who thought Bateman was a menace still went to his place because she needed the money.  Very sad.

69099,3,0783243499,"Self-assured, wealthy, and eminent investment banker Patrick Bateman seems to have the perfect young man's life--entering various clubs at a whim, taking advantage of anyone who is in his way, preaching one thing and living in yet an entirely different style--but his dating habits are most unusual, especially when he gets the chance to get any young lady he can find back into his apartment at American Gardens...
Richly detailed script writing and Christian Bale's iconic (and often very funny performance) cannot erase the fact that AMERICAN PSYCHO simply will not be everyone's cup of tea; in fact, it might be one of the most unusual mainstream pictures you will ever see. Descending as it does into the crippled psyche of Patrick Bateman, Mary Harron's film allows itself to go a long way towards exploiting the angst that lives inside the head of most guys in the modern world but, thankfully, most of them don't have the kinds of harrowing fantasies that Bateman himself suffers from. Because America, in particular, is suffering from a kind of spiritual sickness that no mere smattering of giggles can fumigate, it feels awkward to be laughing at the kind of degradation that Bateman indulges himself in continuously, and yet we do laugh in his presence (partly at the fact that he just can't seem to get himself caught, and partly at the fact that he is himself an utter wreck looking for the perfect outward disguise). Although the Bateman character is the quintessential Reptilian villain of the modern Cineplex, it is strange that author Bret Easton Ellis's source material was not followed a bit more closely (Ellis did write several drafts of the movie in advance of its production, and initially executive producer Pressman wanted to go for an X rating and just limit the film's mass appeal from the get go); still, Harron's film is hardly the most subtle for a picture directed by a woman. While a male director undoubtedly would have done things differently here (and Harron's helming position seems to have been fated due to the studio's desire to quell the flaming furor over the source material's alleged politics), Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner fashion a credible attempt at a man's breakdown on screen. Because we are never entirely sure whether AMERICAN PSYCHO is strictly psychological or partially pragmatic, viewers may end up finding the film a very frightening one on first watch, but do be assured that, for whatever reason, the movie does get funnier the more viewings of it that you allow yourself to suffer through. While it would be irresponsible of me to recommend this picture to Christians or to the casual film student (probably wouldn't show this to many of my close friends, either), I do have to say that AMERICAN PSYCHO, when viewed responsibly, is actually a stalwart satire of the current post-80's Western climate of materialistic hedonism and is a tolerable exercise in imagined psychosis (despite the sometimes unnecessary sex scenes and the rather downplayed instances of graphic violence and carnage). In the end, this is a well cast and nicely photographed film, with Bale being the standout indeed but also being capably supported by other actors who are able to hold up next to him (the business card scene is a classic, hands down). Anyone with good sense probably won't come away from the movie thinking that it wants to encourage violent behavior towards women, but the operative word here is sensible, right? Now, as disturbing as the end result may have been, I would still like to have seen some work from screenwriter Norman Snider as he worked alongside director David Cronenberg during the picture's early development stages. Even an audio recording would have been interesting in my opinion. If you think this picture is distressing as it stands now, just imagine what Cronenberg would have done with it! But, overall, I do enjoy what Harron has created here. In fact, she adds another layer of imagination to the film that would have been absent otherwise. It is probably a good thing that it took so long for this movie to finally get produced because without Bale there simply is no AMERICAN PSYCHO.
The Lionsgate DVD is most definitely a keeper, offering an extensive making of feature, deleted scenes, two fabulous audio commentaries, and previews. I only wish that the Charlie Rose encounter between Harron, Bale, and Ellis had been included as an extra. The overall picture and sound on this DVD are quite superlative, with a terrific transfer in widescreen. Definitely listen to the audio commentaries if you are interested in how the meat was made in this particular instance. C+",1488931200,,4663,4.971830985915493

A movie with multiple explanations of Patrick Bateman imagining the entire thing where he is solely just a psycho that has acted or not acted on some or all of his murders.  The movie is a satire of the yuppie culture that was the 80s, while at the same time showing that the culture itself is very self centered and psychotic.  People don't know each other's names, and people are so into themselves and the latest material things, that someone like Patrick Bateman could potentially get away with murdering people almost right in front of people's nose's and they are so into themselves they wouldn't even know it!

My favorite thing about American Psycho is the fact that you're not sure what's real and what's not. There are a lot of different ways to perceive what's going on in the film, which I won't spoil, and this is what makes the movie a classic in my house.

""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory.

69217,2,0783243499,"This was a ridiculously written movie that shows the trouble that occurs when the children of the mega-rich 1% of the country, grow-up to become young Snooty-McUppity White College Grads obsessed with their ""High-Society-Male White-Privileged"" lives, to the extreme that they even get hung-up jealous of the quality of each other's business cards---even to the point of murder!  These are extremely arrogant, pompous, self-righteous morons who don't even have respect for their own White women---treating them as pieces of meat for their own selfish, sexual lusts with no regard to these White women's feelings or bodies; even having no qualms about injuring them sexually.  They also tend to lack respect or regard towards the women they're actually married-or-getting married to.

  With that being said, the absurdity in Christian Bale's character Patrick Bateman in his sociopathic & psychotic interactions with others in his Apt building, at his stock-trades job, & in his uppity community, are totally ludicrous & defy all common sense.  For example: How the hell could Patrick Bateman drag a huge duffel bag (with a chopped up body inside) across the lobby of his Apt building while leaving a solid-trail of blood in its path, during the wee hours of the morning---and right past the front-desk of the night doorman out to his car---without ever getting arrested?!  No police are ever called to check the blood-trail in the lobby?!  No security-cameras ever lead the Police to this monsters door?  Its an insult to the viewers intelligence to leave that obvious Forensic Evidence & Homicide Investigation out of the script.  The only Investigator thinks of Batemans co-worker as being on vacation---with all that blood on the lobby floor and DNA Forensics being as advanced as it is today where they could have easily  cross-compared the co-worker's medical records & DNA with the blood on the lobby floor of Bateman's Apt building?!  Again, it defies logic.

  And ridiculously, no one in Law Enforcement ever comes to ask any questions to the other Apt-Tenants about the White female prostitute (who Forensics would quickly show, was just treated a couple of days earlier for severe vaginal-injuries that Bateman caused), laying at the foot of the spiral staircase with a huge chainsaw sticking in her side, that Patrick Bateman murdered late at night as well?!  Again---its an insult to the viewers intelligence to leave that obvious kind of Forensic Evidence & Homicide Investigation out of the script.  This isn't the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where people were out in the middle of nowhere being butchered by Leatherface with nowhere to run.  All these events are happening right in one of the wealthiest communities in the big city of New York!  So all of this crap clearly defies logic.

  Im unapologetically disgusted with this movie, and thought by its title & trailer, that it was going to be a well-written script.  Instead I was disappointed and annoyed with the extremely selfish mentalities of these mega-rich White men and their backwards White-Privilege mentalities, coupled with the rich-sociopath whobecause of his White-skin & wealth--- conveniently gets to keep on killing with no ramifications whatsoever.  Clearly if it was a Black-or-Latino guy doing this, they would have locked his behind up with the very first killing of his fellow-wealthy male co-worker.",1459555200,,3390,5.212177121771218

Summary: Harken Back to the Olden Days of BlockBuster
*** This review may contain spoilers ***

If you ever coveted a copy of ""Dress for Success"" as your personal Bible or were captivated by a critical analysis of Whitney Houston or Huey Lewis's artistic efforts, this is a definitive moment captured on celluloid.

Christian Bale of ""Little Women"" fame ascends a slight departure from the loving, kind, gentle soul but retains that ""I Want to Fit In!"" at any cost mentality in this role. I hailed all those many stereotypes, defiled in every scene and found the character hilarious.

Yes, he felt trapped and subjected to lower life forms while comparing watermarks on business cards and the ability to obtain the rare reservation at the latest Phenom restaurant. Who wouldn't lose their mind in this shallow, chasing shadows, meaningless existence? Here, we have an exceptionally sensitive and caring soul who just cannot bear one more moment of the herd mentality and cracks under pressure.

This was a divine commercial for Men's beauty products and regimen to achieve the look of perfection and charm. Such an erudite perspective of a clandestine approach to coping in the material world. Albeit, an unusual take that leaves one gasping for air, but perhaps for naught.

An additional viewing to appropriately review this title is required, but taking chances never did anyone much harm hence, this effort. I found the direction remarkable and parlayed many layers of complexity beyond shallow characters. The color schemes, pacing, scene caressing and framing compiled the true stars of this show.

High recommend for Christian fans, he is absolutely gorgeous, stunning, beautiful and full of promise. Jared Leto has an infinitesimal role yet memorable. Prepare for fantasy blood and gore and the pen-ultimate career of ""Murders and Executions"".",1458604800,3,1860,5.2040133779264215

I am a horror fan and obviously don't have a problem with violence in media, assuming that said violence has some purpose.  Given the theme of exploitation and the philosophical question ""what makes a monster?"" I would have thought the violence would have purpose.  Instead, it just felt gratuitous (even for horror).  I will grant you: Christian Bale plays an excellent narcissistic psychopath.  The results, however, are so over-the-top, gleefully sickening that it is just plain hard to watch.  Without a single redeeming character, this film just played to me as shock for shock's sake - horrible people doing horrible things.  Too sick to be a comedy (even a black comedy), and too flippant to be a drama, I don't really know how one would classify American Psycho, but I have no desire to ever watch it again.",1457740800,,881,4.833333333333333

69402,5,0783243499,"This is a period piece of the 80's.  Greed and excess are the words of the day.  And Patrick Bateman is just another young and determined man in this business world in which he lives.

But what makes him unique amongst his all too similar peers is a more murderous drive that bubbles just beneath the surface.  While his peers might want to try and outdo each other in a best business card competition, Patrick Bateman would rather kill anyone who bests his.

This is a movie about a man losing himself in a world that is too absorbed in itself to really notice just how bad he has fallen.  Much of the movie is almost a cry for help, which basically goes unanswered.  And even though not all is what it nauseam from his prospective, it almost seems like the world just wants to sweep his actions under the rug, or just outright ignore it than face it.

The book this is based on is rather infamous for its very explicit depictions of killings.  The movie, while it does not shy away from explicit content, is much less gratuitous about the evidence it portrays.  Which makes for an altogether better film.  The gratuity generally has a thematic reason.

And stellar performances all around in this film.  Christian Bale pulls off the unhinged and menacing Patrick Bateman amazingly well.  The supporting cast all put in their A game as well.

The directing and pacing are some of the best in the genre.  Which, hilariously, seems to be labelled as comedy on Amazon.  While it's not a totally bleak movie, and does have some dark humor in it, a comedy this is not.  It's really a thriller with shades of horror.  And some of the scenes in the movie will really sit with you after the film is over.

Overall, if you have the stomach for some violence and terror, I do recommend seeing this.  It was one of the best films of 2000, and it's a really affecting story overall.  And it's a story told well through its movie medium.",1449619200,12,1925,4.44

69463,5,0783243499,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece in so many ways. It is an absolutely brilliant satire of late 80's yuppie culture - one that is not only deeply disturbing, but is also darkly hilarious, uncommonly perceptive, has an impeccable eye for detail, contains flawless acting (particularly from Christian Bale, who is a revelation here), and is imminently quotable (""I have to return some video tapes"", ""Because I...just...want...to fit in.."", etc...). It also expertly depicts the study of a man who is deluded and clearly losing his grasp on reality. I also loved how it portrayed the young 80's Wall Street set as so generically interchangeable that both they they themselves and the cops that later got involved with this group had trouble telling many of them apart. There is so much more that I could praise about this film, but I'll run out of space, and I don't wish to give too much away and/or bore anyone. I'll just advice you this: Pay not attention to the 1 and 2 star reviewers. Those calling it ""boring"" (those parts, like of his daily 'beautification routines', are essential to highlight the superficial banality of Bateman and Co's world) or who claim to not understand it I feel aren't meant to be the film's intended audience in the first place. The only legitimate reason I can think to steer clear is if you are severely offended by violence against women (and I am a female). It is an excellent adaptation of the book and an excellent film. I'd call it pretty close to perfection...kinda like the Sea Urchin Cerviche at Dorsia...",1440460800,,1550,4.787313432835821

69469,4,0783243499,"I love this film.  I thought it ridiculously funny.  Absolute satire and a reflection of the early eighties.

Christian Bale is absolutely perfect as the psychotic, paranoid, sadistic Patrick Bateman.  Despite some explicit sex scenes, you sense Bateman has still been untouched, and there is just this terrible block to him.  It takes the extreme to get to him, but he is thin-skinned and vulnerable.  The infamous business card scene has become legendary, but I love the sex scene, where he engages in a threesome just for show and tell, and is completely oblivious to whether it should be enjoyable or not.  His stone face tells all.

I read the book.  The book is a rant all the way through  it keeps its energy up.  The film is brilliant for the first three quarters, but I just loathed the final quarter of the film.

I love the opening of the film.  The parade of ridiculous prissy food  absolutely gorgeous  served on immaculate white plates.  Four yuppies congregate and talk stupid.  They are nicely dressed, rich, and obnoxious.  They think they are special.  The near six-hundred dollar tab is considered cheap, and then Bateman and friends go to a trendy club, where his best friend, Timothy Bryce/Justin Theroux dances stupid.

The next morning, Bateman explains himself.  He knows exactly who and what he is.  He savors the superficial, which is why he spends so much time on his outside form.  And he is observant and accurate about the people around him.  His supposed girlfriend, Evelyn/Reese Witherspoon, is vapid and superficial, wanting to get married for the ceremony of it all.  She does not love him, and he does not love her.  He is having an affair with her best friend, Courtney Rawlinson/Samantha Mathis, who badly wants children but is terrified of getting pregnant (by Bateman at least), and is always tranquilized.  His best friend, Timothy Bryce, is addicted to drugs.

Christian Bale gives a tremendous performance.  One of the best Ive ever seen, and I understand, due to the controversial nature of his role, why he wasn't even up for consideration for an Academy Award nomination.  His performance was engrossing, and probably even superior to the actor who actually won.

The film is great.  Absolutely entertaining.",1438214400,,2253,4.925333333333334

The movie dives into the 80s rich, which still resonates today (or at least in San Francisco), as they only dine in the expensive restaurants with small portions perfectly placed on the plates with drizzled sauce.

69481,2,0783243499,"An oxymoron, I'm aware, but it's certainly the case here. American Psycho stars Christian Bale as an executive from the 80s who likes to kill people that he despises, which is mostly everyone. Don't worry, you won't feel too bad about it because there's nary a single character in this movie you'll like. That's American Psycho's biggest problem, there's no character, no rock on which to cling, to help you wade through the stream of inane dialogue and predictable plot progression. Everyone in the movie is either wholly unlikable or just too bland to even remember. So what's left then? An unforgettable performance by Christian Bale and some good cinematography, without a doubt. Unfortunately, that's not enough to save this shallow criticism of Reagan-era elites. By the time the plot twist in the final moments of the film occurred, I didn't care enough about the movie itself to even try to suss out the meaning of the ending. It's just a boring film.

69492,4,0783243499,"""American Psycho"" is a real thriller.  It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming.  Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders ""twenty, maybe forty people."" It was originally slated for circulation in 1990, but Random House pulled out of distribution, fearing backlash. It was later released as part of a Vintage Series, and quickly sold over 250,000 copies, becoming one of the most popular (and, to some, important) literary works of our time.
In the movie, Welsh actor Christian Bale portrays Bateman gleefully tongue-in-cheek, whether it's confessing to manslaughter over the phone (""I just had to kill a lot of people!"") or dancing to Huey Lewis and the News' ""Fore"" album before hitting an associate over the head with an axe.
Patrick is a troubled guy. On the surface, he appears to be normal  he's a Wall Street broker with a secretary, an expensive apartment suite, his own limo and a fancy business card. But on the inside, he's a monster  complete with an insatiable blood lust and lack of empathy for fellow human beings. (If he can indeed be classified as one.) As a film and a novel, ""American Psycho"" is an attack on the absurdities of the '80s yuppie era  sometimes the satire isn't very subtle, in fact it's often made very clear, but I liked it. Because the movie is so eccentric and over-the-top, and Bale is so loony and maniacal, the satire needs to be equally strong  and it is. Whether it's business men drooling over each other's fetishistic business cards or Patrick discussing the nuances of modern pop music before killing more victims, ""American Psycho"" hits strong and hard  this is a great, overwhelming cinematic and visual experience. It cannot be condemned for being unsubtle  it never was.
The performances are wonderful. Bale is superb as Bateman, totally embodying the character. As a man bewildered by his environment, and wanting only desperately to fit in, Bateman listens to Genesis and ""Hip to Be Square""; finally we have proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis will turn you into the next Ed Gein.
Perhaps some fans of the novel will dislike Bale's performance (at times, it almost seems comical, such as when he murders his coworker Paul Allen, played by Jared Leto). But I thought it was the perfect mix of introspection, self-hatred, outer-loathing, lust, conformity and schizophrenia. Bale manages to capture all of this perfectly, and by the end of the film, I could not imagine anyone else in the role.
Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon all have co-starring roles, but at the end of the day it is Bale who really drives this film home  he's the reason it's worth seeing, and in part the reason it exceeds beyond the typical restraints of its genre.",1430870400,,2840,4.851239669421488

Bale was perfect for this role. He had that emotionless poker face the majority of the time and pulled his characters persona off very well. Witherspoon who played his fiancee was also the perfect choice for the character. Her bubbly yappy personality paired with Bale's poker face was spot on.

This is one of those movies that flip your mind over and over and over again. These are the types of books and movies I'm usually drawn to, where the ending leaves wondering wth just happened.

It captures the superficiality of the 80s business world to perfection, and Bale as the empty on the inside Patrick Bateman is the perfect way to view this world.

69528,5,0783243499,"Based off Bret Easton's novel that takes place in late 1980s New York City, American Psycho is a 2000 Comedy-Thriller Film directed by Mary Harron and starring the legendary Christian Bale

Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman; a rich banker who's living the American dream in late 80s New York City. Most people that know him, see him as a decent human who thrives off success, typically wines and dines at fancy restaurants, all while trying to regularly meet with his fiancee (Reese Witherspoon). However, what they don't see is the mask that he wears that conceals his true identity.

Underneath the expensive suit and charming smile, Patrick Bateman is a sadistic and psychotic serial killer who kills both friends and strangers at will without rhyme or reason. He typically lures his victims to his condo where he shares his fascination of some of his favorite musical artists before murdering them. Throughout; Bateman struggles to find out and try understand just who exactly he is, as he says one of the most famous quotes from the film ""I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.""

Overall: In my opinion they made a great choice in choosing Christian Bale to play the psychotic antagonist of this film. I don't think anyone would've been able to pull it off like Bale; as Bale portrays the character of the murderous Patrick Bateman almost too well! American Psycho doesn't really have a true plot to follow. It's just of a man who kills people and feels himself slowly transitioning into someone he's not. It might be a sick thing to say, but if you have a morbid sense of humor, you may find this movie to be a favorite of yours.  The film does an incredible job at really building on the intensity of the Bateman character throughout the film. The acting from all involved in the film is nicely executed, there are a few scenes you might find yourself unintentionally or intentionally laughing at (it is a dark comedy after all) and for those reasons, I have to give American Psycho 5 stars",1421452800,,2008,4.6960227272727275
69529,5,0783243499,"I watched this movie with my wife a couple of weeks ago on Hulu Plus.
I have to admit that I did not watch the original motion-picture (the one by Alfred Hitchcock, so I cannot compare the two), but this was a very well written and executed film.
It has a far deeper scope than a mere horror gore movie. (some spoilers to follow. consider yourselves warned!)
It reaches into the sole of a business executive, where the inferiority complexes of being ""vise president"", and ""having a lesser quality business card"", will only ignite the grandiose complex of ""killing others with impunity"".
Then when he is ready to crack down and to admit his crimes, he cannot.. because the other ""vise presidents"" apparently need him for alibis of their own, for crimes we don't watch on screen, but can only imagine..
The landlady of the crime seen apartment, whitewashes the walls, and wanting to rent the place, denies him his ""imaginary crimes"".. no crimes ever were committed.. life goes on for all these elitist American psychos...

My favorite part is when he goes on his rant about Huey lewis and the news while playing its hip to be square classic.

69536,5,0783243499,"Christian Bale makes this movie happen because he is that convincing as a deranged yet humorous serial killer; someone you can't quite hate enough because there is something so off color about him it's a backwards type of adorable.  The movie is filled with intrigue and never bores.  It is a strange toxic mix of just snobs hanging out and a passion for serial killing.  If I were to isolate the creepiest moment in this entire film it would be this.  His adoring secretary played extremely well by the outrageously sexy Chloe S. (for fear of spelling the actresses last name incorrectly) in this understated role is finally invited to go out to dinner and come over to his place.  As she is admiring his admittedly very cool apartment with interesting albeit very little artwork on the walls Patrick goes into the fridge to get something and almost as quickly as you see him open the door you see a woman's head on the top rack, the very head of the prostitute he picked up the night before and obviously butchered although the actual scene wasn't shown (although there are other gory scenes so don't panic).  Ultimately what is excellent about this movie is the great acting by the murderer himself and the way in which he manages to fit in so well with his peers that it slips anybody's mind just how sick he actually is even though he is prone to mumble weird things, murderous things.  A pretty bartender complains about the way he is paying and as she concocts his drink he mutters about playing with her blood, then she hands him his drink, looking bored. It's scary when you think how easy it easy for a psychopath to simply slip through the cracks.  SINCE I WROTE THIS REVIEW I HAVE LOOKED AT BLOGS ABOUT THIS FILM AND IT TURNS OUT IT BEING INTERRUPTED IN TWO SPECIFIC WAYS; WAS BATEMAN ACTUALLY A KILLER OR WAS THIS ALL IN HIS HEAD?!  I AM NOW GOING BACK TO RE WATCH THIS BECAUSE SOMETHING IN THE END IMPLIED IT COULD BE IMAGINED; THIS PLUS WHEN THROWING A CHAINSAW ACROSS AN APARTMENT HALLWAY AND HAVING A DIRECT HIT ON THE HOOKER, I EVEN COMMENTED AT THE TIME HOW IT IS THAT NOBODY FROM ANY OTHER APARTMENT SO MUCH AS OPENED THE DOOR WITH ALL THE SCREAMING (COULD HAVE BEEN JUST SCARED TO NOT THAT I THINK ABOUT IT)AND COME TO THINK OF IT EVEN AN INSANE KILLER IS NOT LIKELY TO ACTUALLY GO TO A LAUNDRY MAT WITH A BLOODY SHIRT; THEY WOULD JUST THROW IT AWAY SO THAT COULD HAVE ALL BEEN IN HIS MIND ONLY!!",1420070400,,2417,4.401345291479821

69550,3,0783243499,"The idea behind this movie is almost brilliant and it looks as though Christian Bale was ready to bring some great stuff to the role, but at the end of the day, the screenplay was lacking and not a complete, compact story. As this was adapted from the book ""American Psycho,"" it looks like what happened was that they wanted to stay true to the book, but couldn't fit everything in there for length and violence reasons, so they cut out pieces of the story and sewed it back together with some parts missing, and the whole thing wasn't totally coherent. With a book adaptation, what you are looking for is to capture the incredibly dry humor and the irony of these yuppies' lifestyles. They act incredibly self important but are so stupid and vain. Patrick Bateman is supposed to be worse than the others and the absolute pinnacle of all this. You need to capture the cerebral and ironic humor that is in there, and this movie did that, but it did it too slowly, and without enough poignant punch to the scenes. Cause was not immediately followed by effect and the movie lost its pace and meaning. I believe that they were trying to stay true to the book, but what works in the book doesn't necessarily work on film.

This movie also could have been a ridiculous slasher flick that is a parody of horror films. Couple that with the ridiculous, ironic lifestyles of these yuppies and it could have been funny, but like I said, the succinct meaning and lyricism of the book was probably lost in the translation to film. Bale was good but not perfect, and the movie tread into disturbing territory that was not over the top slasher fare, but too serious and realistic, and ruined the tone of the movie, making violent parts of it unenjoyable. Nobody likes to see people actually getting hurt, and if this could have just been an absurd sendup of the horror genre, it could have been good. If it made fun of horror movies it could have been good, but it made fun of people's suffering, and that's not funny. I applaud them for trying this movie, but it was kind of a swing and a miss. I read some of the non-violent parts of this book, and it was a hilarious parody of the yuppie lifestyle, but the abstract background of the book worked, while the specific visualization of the movie did not. This movie had elements that worked, but didn't totally work on the whole. The jokes were too subtle and drawn out, and the movie didn't build in a logical way, and end with a logical conclusion. Some of the absurd and philosophical elements worked, like when he says that there is no real Patrick Bateman, and some of the atmospheric elements and tributes to Alfred Hitchcock were actually pretty cool. On the whole, a very interesting idea for a movie that didn't totally work, and yes, the violence and darkness were too disturbing.",1416441600,,2825,4.528375733855186
69551,3,0783243499,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. On the one hand it is quite interesting and Christian Bale does an amazing job. On the other hand, the whole thing goes nowhere.

I didn't find it to be ""darkly funny"" or comedic. The only two things that I thought were slightly funny were where he kept using ""I have to return some videotapes"" as an excuse, and when he told the cop he was meeting ""Cliff Huxtable"" for lunch. (Haha - will Claire and Theo be there too?)

So if it was meant to be a dark comedy, it failed on that in my view. Some of the earnest commentary on Huey Lewis and the News I found mildly amusing, but it also got old.

As a scary movie, it isn't particularly frightening. As a thriller, it is pretty good I suppose. Probably it's biggest drawback is that it has few, if any characters to sympathize with, and the lead is not exactly a protagonist.

So the style of the movie is unconventional. With an unlikeable killer as lead, it is very different from most. That could work, if it felt like the story was moving toward some meaningful conclusion.

SPOILER ALERT

A meaningful conclusion never happened. The movie just stopped. I suppose it is meaningful that his ""human"" friends are so shallow that even his confession means nothing, but I found that too unrealistic to be believed.

I did like the aspect of the ending that implies that none of it happened at all. That everything - the killings, the shootings - was all just in his head, as he scribbled his drawings of it all.

After all, how else to explain him dragging a dripping body bag across a hotel lobby, and the guard not noticing the trail of blood? Or shooting a bunch of people in public, and no one notices? Or improbably blowing up two police cars with one pistol? Or running naked and bloody with a chainsaw through a condo with no one noticing? And dropping that chainsaw on somebody???

Even his endless monologues on pop music fit into this. It all paints a picture of a very disturbed mind. A man who spends his spare time watching porn and fantasizing about killing people. It leaves the question at the end: How much of it was even real?

But does it matter? That is what is annoying about the ending. There is no resolution of any kind, except a sort of resignation that he can't change. Then what was the point?

Worth watching once I guess. Not worth buying.",1415577600,,2356,4.418013856812933

But the most notable characteristic is that our main man can hide more or less in plain view the fact that he was and is an insane serial killer.  The murders are quite horrific almost to the point of absurdity because our character seems to take so much joy in  what he does,  with no remorse or guilt whatsoever.  Christian Bale is in almost every single scene and I cannot think of another actor who could have carried this role off with as much intensity as Christian did. While somewhat disturbed by the brutality and horror connected with the killings, you cannot help but wonder where the character will finally meet his end.

69601,5,0783243499,"""American Psycho"" is one of those films that truly deserves a place in the hall of fame, even if it doesn't ever seem to come up. Starring a young and pre-Batman Christian Bale as the main character, Patrick Bateman, this film is not only a great cinematic experience, but a wonderful adaptation, as well.

A story written originally by Bret Easton Ellis, this version tells the story of a psychopath who daylights as a stock broker and moonlights as one of the sickest men alive. Adapted by the writers of ""The Notorious Bettie Page"", Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner, this version contains all the pizazz of the novel without all the overly explicit detail. And while it would have been nice to see the detail, I think it actually is to the film's credit that it doesn't go too far.

This film also keeps the tone the book so richly describes. If you love Ellis's work, this is a film you can get into. The style of director Mary Harron isn't in question here by any means. It's so perfect in so many ways that it's a true classic, both in book and movie form.

It takes a lot to confuse an audience in a good way with dialogue, and Harron seems to be an expert. The movie never seems to follow a straight line. It keeps you guessing in a way that constantly leaves you intrigued. You'll want to obtain understanding, and the movie seems to hold it on a fishing line in front of you while never actually letting you have it.

What really makes this film enjoyable is the deep emotionality of it all. Although Bale is perfect at displaying a man with no emotions, it is so obvious that the world around him is so chaotically predictable that you end up sympathizing with his brand of justice. But it's this awkward sympathy and even empathy that makes this film such a strange experience. Movies like ""Funny Games"" became famous for pressing the issue of empathy, but this film really had a handle on it first, and I think it makes it a true classic.

This film is also so brilliantly sarcastic that it is wildly funny. From Bale's acting to the overly oblivious behavior of all the other characters, the chemistry of this film is dazzling. I think it leaves a feeling of fulfillment that many thrillers and slashers of today so soundly miss. Personally, I couldn't stop laughing, and I think that it's safe to say many viewers would agree with me. This is the kind of film that gets under your skin and just makes you enjoy a bad thing. It's a guilty type of pleasure.

Most importantly, though, this film is believable. The sets are made perfectly and the story fits even more. Patrick Bateman could be your coworker, a guy you met at the gym, or just someone who smiled at you on the bus. The fact that he is an everyman makes the whole thing so much more real. And, frankly, even if there was nothing else to like, that would be enough to call it a decent film.

Overall, I think this film is truly remarkable. I love the atmosphere, the acting, and everything else. If I had to pick a film to call a ""Bale classic,"" this is what I would choose. It's the perfect blend of cinema. If you like horror, you will love this film. But be warned, this is not for the faint of heart. Funny though it may be, it's filled with wonderfully uncomfortable situations. That is honestly the only real drawback to this film. It isn't for anyone who can't handle a lot of dark and deep sarcasm. But it's a small drawback even at that. ""American Psycho"" gets a 5 out of 5.

P.S. For those of you who don't know, this movie was remade into a musical starring ""Doctor Who"" star Matt Smith as Patrick Bateman. As if the film itself didn't have enough to love, that might give you an extra incentive.

69602,2,0783243499,This was a very strange movie; not at all what we were expecting. Be ready for a commentary because Christian Bale narrates the entire movie.,1404172800,,141,4.68
69603,2,0783243499,"An energetic and committed performance and some cleverness throughout make this a mildly entertaining experience. However, the film itself is too prone to openly exposing its shallowness. It has the ingredients to make the social and psychological commentary it wants, but the film never delves as deeply into them as it could. Things get a little redundant after awhile, because for whatever reason the script doesn't seem too concerned with developing things beyond surface-level. Bateman's development over the film goes like this: murderous psycho to suddenly extra murderous with side of unraveling. Just like that. That's how it works. It's an abrupt shift that doesn't feel quite right. The ending too abruptly switches gears and lends itself to what I think is supposed to be surrealism, but it's almost too literal. It screams ""DELUSIONAL. HEY, DO YOU KNOW HE'S DELUSIONAL? OH, MAYBE HE'S REALLY THIS AND THAT."" Harron's approach doesn't strike the balance between psychological horror and biting satire very well. It's all sort of empty in the end. There doesn't seem to be a lot of point to it when the film can't effectively tackle things and, even more so, give depth or reason to what it's trying to say. That and there's no emotional depth to it, which might not have been a problem had the film had more depth in general.",1403827200,3,1337,4.973214285714286
69604,5,0783243499,"One of my favorite movies to date.. get inside the mind of an American Psycho! The movie keeps you at the edge, not knowing what or who will be his next victim.",1403568000,,160,4.03125
69605,5,0783243499,"You have to understand what this movie is, it's dark satire. I love this movie because it's a legit horror film until you try to explain the scenes to someone then you realize how funny it is. Axe Murdering someone to the sound of Huey Lewis and the News? Chasing a hooker through a empty apt complex naked, covered in blood, with a chainsaw, and let's not forget the white sneakers! LOL Tries to feed a kitten to an ATM machine! How can anyone take this seriously? The final scene is what gives it away as dark satire, He legit confesses and it's played off as a joke.",1403568000,,569,4.277777777777778
69606,3,0783243499,Would give this movie five stars if the ending was good. At the end you don't know if the movie was all fake or if it was real. I think it comes across as being all in his head. There is no general consensus as to whether or not it was real. There r no certain clues for you to figure it out either. Its a disappointment and freaking stupid. And if it was all in his head the movie is all a moot point and is stupid. Terrible ending. It should all be real and if it is fake they should give enough clues and hints for you to figure it out for certain.,1403395200,,551,3.8
69607,5,0783243499,"a fan of the Easton Ellis prose The strange depraved stubble of less than zero et al. it's great to see nihilism contrasted by plenty. but what this movie does is something even worse worse than the Wolf of Wall Street. every single human being has a hyde personality it's not restricted to the mentally ill. Those who have the most social privilege and power will naturally have the greatest range of free actions with their inner raging demon.. this is a roadmap to the secret fantasies of the lower echelons of control groups in Western society. extrapolate this further and give him authority, intelligence credentials with police authority. add high-tech voyeurism with Uncle Sam paying for $1 billion of gadgets.
The reason I suggest you watch this movie is because anyone in anything can trigger the personality even in you. yours may be the sexual type not the murderous type, reggae music tequila or erotic literature may make you exceptionally horny this poor flat emotional character doesn't have access to that.  all in all a scary movie.",1403308800,,1050,4.898876404494382
69608,4,0783243499,"I rated this slightly low only because of the bonus features, they're average I guess. All there is is a boring featurette about the 1980's, and a few vastly uninteresting deleted scenes. The movie itself is all I cared about anyway. Patrick Bateman is one of the best-written characters I've ever seen. He's clearly so dark and twisted, yet he has a very convincing and charming facade. The story does get a bit clumsy near the end, I won't say too much, but it seems to be a bit of a an allegory for society letting criminals getting away or something to that effect. Other than that, and some other general weirdness aside, I definitely recommend it. But, only if you're up for a sick ride.",1403049600,,693,4.507936507936508
69609,5,0783243499,i liked it as much as a movie that i watched starring Christian Bale. I give the movie 9/10 bats,1402876800,,96,3.85
69610,3,0783243499,"You never truly know someone until you have lived with them. Such can be the case in this flick. Heavy in nostalgic 80's theme music, clothing and slang. The movie can be a gory way of concluding you might have a problem or you might not.",1402272000,,238,4.195652173913044
69611,5,0783243499,Great movie! It has drama and comedy. I think the extras are exceptional. The quality is great for a Blu-ray.,1402272000,,109,4.5
69612,1,0783243499,"Dark, gory, violent. Didn't like at all. Couldn't watch the whole thing. Maybe if there were nothing else to watch.",1402185600,,115,4.8
69613,5,0783243499,"It's awesome!!!, if you get the dark comedy aspect of it; and not in it for the ""horror"" genre it's sometimes mistakenly placed in.

Christian Bale is a great actor, and the aesthetics he brings to this movie are also a major plus. Willem Dafore, Chlo Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto are all in it, enough said! It's a great movie, I love it.",1401580800,,349,4.453125
69614,5,0783243499,This is a very interesting social satire based on consumerism during the 80s. The humor is twisted and the dark subject matter will not appeal to some. It's true to the novel for the most part and worth a look.,1400976000,,210,4.275
69615,4,0783243499,Interesting movie.  Enjoyed it although it jumped around a bit. Have been told book is great and ties all loose ends together,1400544000,,125,4.681818181818182
69616,2,0783243499,"I just want to provide a review of the bluray quality for fans who were looking toward purchasing this movie for their collection.  Id have to say the bluray transfer is not as good as it could be. I was personally very disappointed when hoping for a HD version. Right off the top of the movie, there are lots of pops and marks that appear from the film transfer. As far as the clarity of various actors skin and clothing, its all VERY blurred and smudgy compared to what Ive seen to date. Its definitely better than a dvd, but not as good it should be. Im sure there will be a better transfer in the future, so Id wait until then to purchase this version.",1400544000,,656,4.2063492063492065
69617,4,0783243499,"Great music and story-line about HIIIIIIGGGGGHHHHHH Aristocracy and their total immunity from the laws, customs, more's and traditions of civilized men!  Bred by privilege and disgusting lack of convention they prey on the innocent, weak, and impoverished plebes that dominate in numbers, but nothing else.  This is as much a political insider's view of what privilege looks like in an insane and corrupt society.  We the People are nominally gifted, but without Unions and power WE are diminished and poor thanks to apathy and the gutless search for materialism without morality!  A modern Babylon we are; drug infested and rudderless in a sea of alcohol and chemical indulgences craven sexual lusts characterize our Nation today!",1400457600,,731,5.3304347826086955

69619,1,0783243499,I am not giving this movie anymore of my time. All I can say is the movie is totally ridiculous. I watched the whole movie just to see this train wreck to the end. Pass it by!,1400371200,,175,3.7567567567567566
69620,4,0783243499,Very sexually psychotic this man. So nice to look at too. What else can I say...it made me laugh (I'm sick and twisted too).,1400198400,,124,4.208333333333333
69621,1,0783243499,"I love suspense and horror films, and I thought with the actors cast in this film it would be great.  I was very disappointed. This movie was just strange and hard to follow.",1399939200,,174,4.2727272727272725
69622,2,0783243499,"The plot was weak, the acting was strange, and I had to watch Equilibrium after this just so that Christian Bale could redeem himself.",1399852800,,134,4.625
69623,5,0783243499,"I don't know if Mr. Bale wants to forget this movie as a youthful indescretion, but in fact it is a remarkable performance in a movie that feeds off our obsession with violent human behavior. Bale plays a serial killer, or does he? I don't want to give away the plot for anyone who missed this early Bale film, as I did, so I won't go further. The ending might be a little bit too playful and artsy for some viewers, but in a way it was a way to come down from the mountain top in one piece. Brilliant.",1399507200,,502,4.03
69624,1,0783243499,"Strange movie with no real reason to his insanity.  No closure either...just a random spattering of homicide, psychosis, and nonsense.",1399420800,,134,5.7
69625,5,0783243499,HE DID A GREAT JOB.. I think he did hard work on this film and really portrayed the characher well,1399334400,,98,3.95
69626,3,0783243499,"The only thing that saves this movie at all is Christian Bale's performance which is sufficiently over the top to turn the movie into the satire, I believe, it was meant to be. Short of that, it's trash!",1399161600,,203,4.368421052631579

69628,5,0783243499,"This has got to be in my top 7 or 8 favorite movies i've ever seen... maybe top 5. I think Christian Bale was the perfect fit for this role... they just don't make movies like this anymore... this dvd is well worth the money...

hey Hollywood... bring us back to the Pulp Fiction mid to late 90's days so we can have more great films like this",1398902400,,343,4.044117647058823
69629,1,0783243499,"Not sure if the story was shortened for time, but really didn't understand what the plot was... Kept building and building and then ended without a clear answer... Like they ran out of money or time... Both?",1398729600,,207,4.621621621621622
69630,5,0783243499,I've seen this movie multiple times but I wanted to have it on dvd. It's definitely a classic. The price can't be beat.,1398297600,,119,4.217391304347826
69631,2,0783243499,"Director Mary Harron unleashes a major disappointment. ""American Psycho"" (2000) loses its satirical venom at the halfway mark  degenerating into slasher-movie clichs. A tour de force portrayal from Christian Bale is not enough to sustain this uneven adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' controversial 1991 novel. The film's limp conclusion only emphasizes its wasted potential.",1398124800,3,373,5.907407407407407
69632,3,0783243499,"Very creepy. He gives new meaning to the term ""psychopath."" But... I couldn't stop watching. I needed to see what happened in the end. However, it left me wondering if the lawyer believed him and if he was actually caught. All in all, a decent movie.",1398038400,,250,4.456521739130435
69633,2,0783243499,its a very superficial movie about the life of a sociopathic killer. not a whole lot of character or storyline depth,1397779200,,116,4.571428571428571

69635,5,0783243499,"I have recently begun buying movies on Blu-ray instead of the traditional DVD. This is in my top 10 favorite movies so I won't write too much on the movie itself and its also 14 years old, so most people who have wanted to see the movie have already done so.

The acting by Bale and even by the supporting cast were great. I love the movie along with the book and the only complaint I would have with the movie itself is the ending. The ending was not as ambiguous as I would have liked, and I believe misled some viewers who have never read the book.

I have the movie on DVD and found that the transfer to Blu-ray was fantastic. The picture was better than expected and the audio is really good, not as strong as the picture, but still very good.

Picture: 10/10
Audio: 8.5/10

I would have liked the audio to be better, but honestly I have no complaints out of a movie that came out fourteen years ago. I would recommend anyone who loves the movie to buy a copy and enjoy a satirical masterpiece with fantastic acting, good dark humor, and good, interesting plot.",1397520000,,1066,4.288557213930348
69636,3,0783243499,"I found this movie disturbing, but, given the title, that was probably the whole point of the movie! I would actually give it 2-1/2 stars, but I had to round up",1397174400,,160,4.193548387096774
69637,1,0783243499,"We had just watched the movie Hitchcock and wanted to watch Psycho. Amazon doesn't carry Psycho, and this movie came up as a choice. Poor choice, we only lasted a few minutes and turned in off.",1397088000,,193,4.388888888888889

69639,1,0783243499,I could only stand about 20 minutes before i shut it off. Just so stupid. Nobody i knew talked like that in the 90's or when ever this came out.,1396483200,,144,3.8333333333333335
69640,4,0783243499,The perfect movie for when you are feeling like a psycho. Also has a great soundtrack with Whitney Houston and Huey Louis and the news.,1396396800,,135,4.44
69641,4,0783243499,"Christian Bale is wild AND crazy in this role about a rich neurotic in the big city.  He surely is an American Psycho as he goes creepily through his life inside and outside his head.....you just don't know what's real and what's not.  The movie keeps your eyes wide open and keeps you guessing right up to the end.

It's one of those movies you'll think about after you turn off the TV.  Good film!",1396224000,,399,4.28
69642,4,0783243499,I liked it.  it was a little different entertainment wise for me.  Very entertaining & amusing.  But good.  I recommend it to others.,1396051200,,133,4.6521739130434785
69643,5,0783243499,"I love this movie, it really surprised me, how good is Christian here, the plot, all the music, it is a masterpiece, and in Blu-ray, WOW, just wow...",1396051200,,149,4.357142857142857
69644,4,0783243499,Christian Bale isn't always my favorite actor but his performance in this movie is nothing short of spactacular. Always a great movie to watch anytime,1395964800,,150,5.04
69645,4,0783243499,"Movie was well performed.  The monolog was done articulately. It gave the movie a nice touch. Not a movie I would watch a million times,  but it was worth watching the one time.",1395878400,,177,4.333333333333333
69646,4,0783243499,"Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is just your normal New York investment-banking executive who kills people in his spare time. Bateman doesnt have a real motive to his killings. He is self absorbed and only cares about his own well-being. He is a perfectionist. Everything has to be done routinely. Throughout the movie he struggles with inner conflicts, which ultimately leads to his insanity.

Nothing is ever enough with Bateman. For example, there is a scene where all the executives are showing their name cards to one another, and Bateman starts to get jealous because their name cards are better than his. Even the smallest things could set him over. Bateman wants to be overall better than his coworkers. He wants the better hairstyle, the better clothing style, better name cards, better cars, better apartment, etc. Bateman has the idea he can eliminate some competition just by killing them off.

This is one of Christian Bales best performances as an actor. He plays the psychopathic killer role extremely well. In fact there are even times where he is too believable. That is what distinguishes a good actor from a great one.

A question you have to ask yourself, did Bateman really do these killings or was this all in his mind? This is a complex question because throughout the movie Bateman kills numerous people but the ending leaves it wide open to a possibility that he may not have killed anyone. This is a question you would have to ask yourself while watching this movie.

I recommend this movie for anyone that wants to watch a psychological thriller.

69649,5,0783243499,"This is honestly one of the last brilliant films to come out of Hollywood.  Those who went to see it expecting SCREAM, I am sorry for you, this is a genuine horror movie, not a teenage make out movie.  Christian Bale is all out amazing in this movie, and as a book to movie it was decent over all.  The book is a little more disturbing than the film, but apparently that is better according to the 1 star reviews.  Take into consideration where you get your opinions, as a horror buff and psych thriller buff, this is a great movie.  When it comes to sociological commentary and satire, this is a fantastic movie.  Lastly, when it comes to that burning desire inside to just rip the heart out of that bastard who needs to have his heart ripped out, this is the best movie!",1395705600,,772,4.289655172413793

69651,2,0783243499,"I heard good things about it randomly on the internet so decided to give it a watch.

The way the main character acts is very.. interesting to say the least. I recently finished watching movies with the Hannibal Lector character who is also psycho. That character in that movie was great and spooky. This character is extremely random and constantly energetic. It's actually kind of boring for me to see someone so jumpy that is psycho because it almost makes the mood seem happy even though it should feel somewhat suspenseful.. It's not eerie at all.. not scary in the slightest. It does make you want to finish it to see what the hell is going on, but in the end, nothing is answered. It's so open and unsatisfying that it's just.. sad realizing that I watched the whole thing.",1395532800,,780,4.571428571428571

I added it to my watchlist because it sounded interesting and I think Christian Bale is a very good actor. Also some of the reviews made it sound like something I would get into. Dark,twisted and humorous! After all,one of my favorite authors is Stephen King! So a few days later I had some time to watch it. What a great movie! I can't believe I never heard of it before. Christian Bale is outstanding as a sick,tortured soul torn between his desire to be the man everyone wants to emulate with the right apartment,the right clothes,the perfect manicure,hell even the best business card and his hatred and contempt for those same like people. The things he gets away with saying in general conversation,because everyone else is too celf-centered to hear him are quite funny. His commentaries on his favorite musical artists are hilarious! When he kind of shimmied (yes,Christian Bale shimmied!) across the room to Huey Lewis and The News I almost choked! What a riot! I have never seen him in a role where he was so animated and he nailed it! The supporting cast was very good as well. This movie is definitely worth your time,I highly recommend it.",1394755200,,1277,4.629955947136564

Original score I would have given immediately after watching the movie was 1 star, but upon more thought and discussion, I have revised it to 4 star for the way the movie was assembled that brought out that unsettling feeling which psychosis will, so I had to give it a higher rating.  Not one for an evening of relaxing at the movies, but one which leaves an after taste long after the lights go out.  As to what that after taste is, depends on the individual viewer.",1394582400,,652,4.594827586206897

I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

Patrick broke out in a cold sweat when he realized that one of his co-workers had a better card than he did.  Meanwhile, he's as cool as a cucumber while he's terrorizing, stabbing, bludgeoning, dismembering, etc... his victims.  WTF!!!  Then there's his morning spa/exercise routine.

What is really like was in the books Bateman will talk about music in a single chapter kinda bogging down the book since it has no real purpose to the story. But in the movie the incorporate that into the killings to make them so much better. This movie is fun and really delivers the thrills, compared to the book, i am kinda glad they cut some content the deaths while more gory and sexually deviant in the book where a bit over the top to make it more satirical, i personally felt that the deaths and sexual content in the book didn't add to the overall story.

69849,2,0783243499,Christian Bale as of late has come into his own I love the movies he head been in and he always plays his role with a great amount of care and is very convincing. this movie shows how an actor fine tunes his skills with roles and movies as they are added to their resume. didn't like it it wasn't his best work done the story line was not gripping.,1389052800,,348,3.9857142857142858

It also shows that despite how much wealth or status you may have, you can still be miserable, sick, and disconnected to the point of depression (but in this case he doesn't feel at all, which is worse).  This movie is great if you like shows like Dexter or Breaking Bad - it's smart, disturbing, and sends a messege about the human condition.  Enjoy!",1388880000,,510,4.5

I don't quite understand the ending, but I'm not really bothered by it.  It does an excellent job of pointing out the astoundingly shallow culture of the 80's (I was in my late teens, early 20s during this time) without quite making fun of it.  Bale is remarkable in the part.  It's one of the few movies that can make me laugh and then be disgusted, all in the span of a few seconds.",1388793600,,530,4.207920792079208

69878,1,0783243499,I own this movie. I bought it because it was for sale at $5.00 years ago. I keep it so I will not rebuy it. They have a lot of copies they can not get rid of. There are some movies that when an actor acts in them every time you see that face again you see that character they played this is one of two that I see that way. the other is the very beautifull  acteress that played the people eater in Angel . Every time I see her I see maggots eating her face. Every time I see this mans face I want to puke. This is a horrable movie who those who keep the chainsaw movies going around and around should love. As my late husband and our family say the goulies. The people who go to wrecks hoping to see parts of peoples bodies and the blood and gore that turns their sick minds on. And turns real people's stomach. If you are a goulie you will love this movie. It is so disgusting that real people will turn it on just to say it turns their stomach so bad that every time they see this actor they are sick from seeing this movie. By real people I mean People who where raised by loving parents to know what is right and what is wrong. Rapist and child molesters are wrong. People dying for some sick sob's delight is wrong.,1388707200,,1220,3.979591836734694

69892,5,0783243499,"Probably one of the greatest movies of the 2000's, ""American Psycho"" made Christian Bale a movie star and is a film that definitely lives up to its theme and time in American history: the Reagan Era when people wanted more riches and the more they got the greedier they became often with dramatic results.

 Bale plays a rich corporate young man who has it all...great apartment, beautiful clothes, great body and money. He's more like a Jeckyl and Hyde in that by day he's crunching numbers and making a fortune for the company he works for, but at night he's a homicidal killer.

 The film was really the starting point for the TV series ""Dexter"". Well-written and extremely well-acted by Bale, it is Bale who makes the movie believable. Also, he is not shy in showing what he physically has to offer! They are many explicit sex scenes, but one can't help feel sorry for this man who definitely has a few screws loose in his head.",1388534400,,932,4.562874251497006

Those are certainly here, but unlike the so-calld ""torture porn genres (i.e. any Saw sequel) the gore etc. are not the central focus.

69956,4,0783243499,"This is how you get someone to watch a movie. I've been watching a lot more ""modern"" movies lately and when you compare them to this film. They just don't compare in the slightest.

Let me tell you something, this is how you do a character development story. This is also how you throw the audience in for a ride and make them squirm in their seats.

Let's get started:

Straight off the bat, I don't know if I am particularly sensitive to this or if the movie just did it really well. But anything involving the prostitutes and women just made me so uncomfortable. I dreaded seeing what would happen to these women. I was at the end of my seat, praying and hoping that nothing would happen to his secretary. I felt bad for the prostitutes and was sad when they left his room bloodied and bruised. I felt sad for them because, they were just... doing what they were told for the money even though they didn't want to.

This movie did an excellent job of building suspense and then giving you a satisfying conclusion to the suspense. Unlike the drek Paranormal Activities. When the movie builds up the tension and get you ready to be scared, frightened, or disturbed? It delivers in full impact. You're either going to breathe a sigh of relief or coil back in horror.

The movie also did an excellent job of capturing what I guess is the theme of the novel (never read it myself). That everyone is so self absorbed with themselves, their money, their power, their things, their looks, which ultimately makes you feel disgusted with their society. In fact, these people are so abhorrent (kind of like the Kardashians) that you're actually happy when Bateman kills one of them.

In fact, even though this movie came out in 2000, it still resonates with TODAY'S SOCIETY! We haven't learned how to be less materialistic yet and those same, self absorbed people, still exist and plague our culture and society.

Although Bateman is a despicable character. He's definitely a villain that you can love to hate. Some of the stuff certainly got laugh out loud funny and ludicrous. But in the end, the film really delivers one heck of an experience.

So why not rate it 5 stars?

Well, for starters. I don't think this movie has replayability. Any movie that I'm happy to see over and over again gets a 5 stars. This is not one of them, only because once the surprises are gone there's really not much left.

Also, a few people said that some of these parts were supposed to be satirical and funny. Although I get why people would see that, I didn't really find myself laughing along with the jokes. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but I think I was too engrossed in being disgusted with their behavior to really laugh along with the jokes.

And the ending. The ending wasn't really a let down, but at the same time it wasn't quite right. I got what the director was going for, it made sense and was executed way better than any other films I've seen. But at the same time, it just wasn't that satisfying. If you haven't seen the movie, I can't really say what happens, because the ending is designed so that you draw your own conclusions from it.

Ultimately, the film was fascinating to watch and had me engrossed from the start. Definitely give it a watch if you've not seen it.",1387238400,,3271,4.506756756756757

69962,4,0783243499,"I really liked ""American Psycho"" for its merciless satire of superficial yet generic Wall Street types of the late 1980s. Christian Bale delivered a breakout performance as serial killer/businessman Patrick Bateman.

The problem is the video transfer. It's very hit or miss. At times color is satisfactory and detail is reasonably sharp. At other times the picture is soft and colors and shadow detail is flat. The opening titles just don't look good at all, they're soft, yet have halo problems around the lettering -and the image just isn't very steady. The HD transfer appears derived from a HD telecine source. A bit of dirt and debris pop up in the image from time to time. This movie would benefit from a print cleanup and digital intermediate treatment. Unfortunately, this title has limited appeal. So I think chances are slim it will get an improved re-release.

Audio Quality - it's decent, but the DTS-HD High Res track doesn't have a whole lot besides dialog and 1980s music to show off.

Everyone ranted and raved about how good this film was, but I was shocked at how tame it was. That book terrified me and the ending was so startling. But in the film it was so watered down. Even the horror scenes they did show were mild and easy to swallow. But, more than anything else I was disappointed in how brief the ending was. There was not emphasis drawn to the fact that Patrick Bateman was a loser who created this world in his head, a world where he could take his aggression out on the people who would not deal with his petty view of the world. I felt like the end of the film could have been a little more dramatic. It left me feeling like I was missing something.

69975,4,0783243499,"American Psycho is a surprisingly funny movie. Patrick Bateman is supposed to embody all the worst qualities a man can have. But instead of coming across as the ultimate chauvinist pig, he comes across as a vain, bitchy homosexual. Fussing over one's appearance and popular music (as Bateman does) is a preoccupation of gay men. The book was written by a homosexual and directed by a woman (apparently a feminist), so perhaps this is why the insight here is a bit skewed. It is a homosexual's, or a feminist's, idea of a chauvinistic, egotistical male. It is an amusing caricature nonetheless.

There are scenes that do capture the sort of male Bateman is supposed to represent. One of them had me in stitches. The scene features Bateman seated at a restaurant with some co-workers, where he delivers a sanctimonious speech about the need to end apartheid, provide for the homeless and fight for women's rights. Of course, Bateman believes none of this (prior to the scene, Bateman kicks a homeless man to death; and when he isn't objectifying women, he's concocting fantasies about murdering them). The speech is so phony that one of Bateman's co-workers cracks up. He can see right through it. That sort of empty moral posturing is typical of Bateman's type and it is quite artfully satirized in the scene.

Bateman says that there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, but that as a person he simply doesn't exist. I take this to mean, not that Bateman is a psychopath, but that he's an instantiation of a Platonic ideal. He's an archetype of a narcissistic man. This is why his co-worker Paul Allen confuses Bateman with another co-worker, Marcus Halberstram. Even Bateman's own lawyer does this, calling him ""Davis."" Bateman is interchangeable with the other employees--he could be any one of them. The company is full of Patrick Bateman's, so he might as well be Marcus Halberstram or Davis.

I'm not sure what the imaginary murders are supposed to mean. Bateman ostensibly murders his ex-girlfriend and a hooker, but when he returns to the scene of the crime there is no trace of the bodies. Bateman murders Paul Allen, but Bateman's lawyer claims that he ate lunch with Allen after the murder. However, the lawyer confuses Bateman with another man named Davis, so it's possible that he confused Allen with someone else. We never see Allen after the murder and a detective is hired to investigate his disappearance. And how did Bateman get into Allan's apartment to leave a message? I'm thinking Bateman did murder Allen, but maybe not the women. Some of this is obviously in Bateman's head (the ATM machine did not really tell him to stuff a kitten inside of it, and he didn't blow up those cop cars).

Here I was expecting a gory thriller, but it turned out to be a satire, and an amusing one at that.",1377734400,3,2805,4.753593429158111

And if anything, the movie is even more wonderfully brutal than Brett Easton Ellis original book -- a scathing, unnerving movie that swings between savage violence and hilariously sick social satire. But what really makes it work is Christian Bale, who is utterly perfect as the titular American psycho. Every smile, snarl and twitch from this man is utterly perfect.

Patrick Bateman (Bale) is the perfect yuppie -- he has a high-paying job and a beautiful fiancee (Reese Witherspoon). He dines at all the best restaurants and goes to the best clubs. He keeps his body, New York apartment and wardrobe in perfect condition, and gives detailed descriptions of his designer clothes, beauty products and music collection.

But when his associate Paul (Jared Leto) flaunts a business card that is superior to Bateman's, it sends him into a psychotic rage -- first he kills an old man and his dog, then he cheerily axes Paul to death. A detective named Donald Kimball (Willem Defoe) investigates Paul's disappearance, but doesn't seem to connect Bateman to the man's disappearance despite his many lies.

As the days roll by, Bateman's homicidal urges begin to spiral out of control as he kills more and more people, descending deeper and deeper into his own bloody madness. Will he finally be caught for his crimes, and will his insanity finally swallow him up?

It sounds like a cliche, but ""American Psycho"" is all about the emptiness of a life without real substance. Every part of Patrick Bateman's life is carefully chosen for the image it gives him. Within that shell of material wealth is a howling void, and the only thing that fills that soul-destroying emptiness is hate, rage and violence.

But Mary Harron doesn't preach to you. She starts the story off relatively quietly, following Bateman around his everyday life -- only interrupted by brief explosions of violence (""I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood""). But as the movie unfolds, the story becomes more gruesome -- and more surreal. By the finale, the world has been warped into a bloody funhouse mirror where nothing can be trusted.

Consider: an ATM demands that Bateman feed it a cat... and he does. He manages to kill a prostitute by FLINGING A CHAINSAW DOWN A STAIRWELL. And he cheerfully dances through his apartment in a tidy raincoat, babbling about music right before he axes his nemesis in the head.

Christian Bale is scarily brilliant in this role, in the way that only the best actors can be. Not everybody can play a psychotic this perfectly. Reportedly he based his performance on Tom Cruise, and I can see that -- Bateman greets the world with a friendly voice and a shiny smile. But his eyes are cold and empty, except when the rage and hate begins to well up behind them.

And yet... and yet Bale still manages to make you feel vaguely sorry for Bateman every now and then. He's insane, empty and seems to yearn for the human connections he only knows about through songs. He's pitiable, freakish and terrifying.

""American Psycho"" is wickedly funny, surreal and gruesome -- and Christian Bale is utterly sublime as a psycho that nobody seems to recognize. Absolutely stunning.",1364947200,,3328,4.833040421792619

70012,5,0783243499,"American Psycho (film) Review
By Ryan Blackburn

 American Psycho was released on the big screens in America in April of 2000. Much like its brother in print, the film was criticized for its graphic sexual and violent content. The film has a cult following and boasts four stars on the International Movie Database.
 With Christian Bale starring as Patrick Bateman, the film features only one known star. While Bale was a star in 2000, his fame then was nothing compared to the fame he has today. After the Batman trilogy and the Terminator, and Terminator: Judgment Day movies, it is easy to forget Christian Bale even starred in American Psycho.
 While Bale's resume may have higher grossing films and critically acclaimed roles, his portrayal of the sociopathic Patrick Bateman should not be overlooked. Bale worked extremely hard on his adaptation of the role, including demanding physical exercise. This was necessary to portray Patrick Bateman's intense narcissistic obsession with fitness and shallow vanity. I liked Bale as Bateman; it may be his most perfect role. He is capable of being the handsomely beautiful man on the big screen that Patrick Bateman is described as in the book. He has the range of being able to shift from perfect etiquette to murderer flawlessly.
Some novels are never meant to be made into films, it is impossible for their creativity and uniqueness to translate well to the big screen. Christian Bale saves American Psycho from falling into this category. Bale is capable of flashing that evil behind his eyes that actually makes you believe he feels the bloodlust you're seeing. I read the novel before I saw the movie, and like all readers I was hesitant to see the movie, fearing it would not adapt well. Thankfully this was not the case.
 American Psycho is not perfect however. It is far from it. The transition between scenes was excellent, as was the overall camera work. The portrayal and critique of ""yuppie"" culture that appears in the novel is presented well. But the character of Patrick Bateman is inconsistent. During most of the movie, Bateman is a cold, evil, invincible force. In the end of the movie, Bateman's final, moving scene is a shot with him on the phone in tears, confessing his crimes. He then attends a dinner party in which he confronts the very person he confesses his crimes to, only to be mistaken for someone else, and his confession is assumed as nothing more than a joke. This is where much of the idea that the entire story of Patrick Bateman is a madman's illusions, suggesting that it was all made up. The film differs greatly from the novel here. In the novel's ending, the reader is not left with this depiction of Bateman. He continues on with his sociopathic ways. The movie produces even less of a legitimate ending, only suggesting that the story was made up. This is where I could perceive a change in the movie making it much better, solidifying the storyline instead of castrating it.
 I would have to recommend this film for anyone who is a fan of Christian Bale, or unique thriller movies. There is quite a lot of wit written into the dialogue throughout the movie, making even the most bloodless scenes enjoyable.",1360022400,,3200,4.8090909090909095

70016,5,0783243499,"At first I was put off by the violence, but came to realize this movie is probably the best commentary on the 1980's era and the attitudes of the 1%ers since then. Bale's performance is stellar as he embodies the benumbed mindset of the Masters of the Universe that Tom Wolfe wrote about in ""Bonfire of the Vanities"". The Bateman attitude towards others continues to this day by those in power and those that stand in the shadows behind them.  Bateman's violent rampage, his crack up and recovery when he realizes nothing will happen to him and he won't be punished is Vulture Cannibalistic Capitalism writ large. This movie is not for the faint of heart or squeamish, but it is an unflinching look at our values as a country and culture, and where we'd rather not look.",1357948800,,770,4.579710144927536

70025,5,0783243499,"The broken man stands as an indictment of our own inhumanity.

He reaches out, continually, trying to find a human connection in a sea of flesh. He is surrounded by shallow people, in high society, incapable of having any meaningful conversation, incapable of true empathy towards one another, inexorably constructed by the media around them.

However, as everyone around him seems to thrive in this 80's based, high-society due to these inhuman characteristics that have become increasingly reminiscent of our society, writ large, you have Patrick Batemen, being utterly consumed by them.

From a psychology perspective, it's actually quite an astutely written film (book) and character. From a satire perspective it's nothing short of brilliant. However, it can at times be bloody, gruesome, and downright gross, it certainly isn't for everyone, but ultimately the film misportrays itself as a killer flick. The murdering and sex, are circumstantial to the true point of the film, which is social satire.

I found the Blu-ray rather satisfying. I could very easily pick up on the film grain and was more than pleased with the picture quality. It's perhaps not the best I've ever seen, but nothing warranting 1 star reviews. I can't comment on the surround sound though, as I've only got a two speaker setup.",1353715200,,1309,5.131455399061033
70026,3,0783243499,"""American Psycho"" (2000) didn't look like a promising film for me. On the surface, the plot is essentially the reverse of ""Deathwish."" In ""Deathwish"" a respectable citizen in New York City forsakes the law to secretly kill criminal scumbags in the name of justice; in ""American Psycho"" a scumbag in New York City masquerades as a respectable citizen while secretly murdering innocent people.

I didn't think I'd like this film because the main character is, well, an American psycho (Christian Bale), which means it's impossible to care about him or root for him. In fact, pretty much the only people in the film that you might care about or root for are the psycho's secretary, Jean, and the detective (Willem Dafoe).

So the film starts off with a strike against it, but then I found myself getting into the story, meaning I was entertained, and that's the name of the game in cinema.

I also got the joke. ""American Psycho"" is not a serious horror movie or drama; it's a black comedy or satire. As such, it's impossible to take seriously and be scared; and there are quite a few amusing or laugh-out-loud scenes (like the head in the fridge).

Thankfully, ""American Psycho"" has meaning beyond the surface. It's a commentary on the emptiness of America's materialistic, irreligious modern culture. Our innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of spiritual faith as we desperately search for meaning in secularism, materialism, pompous titles and the outward images of success, which generally leaves us looking good, but spiritually bereft. Life becomes virtually meaningless beyond the mechanics of the grind and everything that goes into it. People become mere objects to compete with or fulfill selfish desires. Etcetera. ***SPOILER ALERT*** And then the final act strongly hints that none of the murders are real; it's all in his mind and he's going deeper into insanity.***END SPOILER***

I don't know if it's because of Bale's subsequent fame as the Batman or what, but ""American Psycho"" has become a popular cult film since its poor performance at the box office in 2000.

This is a hard R-rated film, so stay away if you're not in the mood for heaps of violence, gore, nudity, sex and cussing.

Perhaps this is a commentary on the audience. If you see it and aren't repulsed by the violence towards women, you may continue to watch and be entertained and then be confused by it's ending.

Don't get me wrong--I like Christian Bale. I think he's an incredible (and heartbreakingly attractive) actor, but his ability to portray tortured souls that he has become so well known for is not at all apparent in this film, which arguably features the most tortured soul (Patrick Bateman) of any of Bale's roles. Patrick Bateman is a sadistic, cruel, knee-buckling misogynist in the novel with a crippling self-conscious streak who tortures and kills his victims in such horrifying ways that I felt physically ill reading about them. This is not the same Patrick Bateman Bale's performance provides us with, however. Instead, we are introduced to a dashing young man who, although admittedly tortures women, has a cute enough smile and mild enough demeanor that we find ourselves almost siding with him, much in the way Showtime's Dexter cultivates viewer empathy. I admit that this softened version of Mr. Bateman does not necessarily distract from the film's message, but it drastically mutes the sinister undertone and character complexity that made Brett Easton Ellis's novel so infamous in the first place.",1346976000,,1338,5.086363636363636

70044,5,0783243499,"AMERICAN PSYCHO, 12 years after its release as a film, retains its power as a very dark human comedy. Based on the popular Bret Easton Ellis  novel and adapted for the screen by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron it has the effect on the surface of being a brutally disgusting horror story but if the viewer stops there the point of the tale is missed. This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.

Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an obsessive compulsive, style driven, ego maniacal successful wealthy Wall Street figure, working for this father's company.  The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day - doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting body Bale built is stunning eye candy!), every lotion and potion he puts on his face to keep his youthful appearance, dressing in the most expensive clothes and concentrating on reservations in the most expensive and exclusive restaurants for lunches and dinners with his associates (Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage).  Critical of even the appearance of the outfits and shoes of his secretary (Chlo Sevigny) and polished like a gleaming Tiffany diamond, he is as shallow as those around him in the `look at me' 1980s. He is dating a would-be fianc&eacute;e (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her.  Instead, at night Patrick murders people: he picks up hookers, kills them and mutilates them, hiding them in plastic bags like so much discarded clothing. He also murders street people for no reason and then begins a killing spree that reveals how completely psychotic he is, pretending to be a person he has already killed (Josh Lucas). The only law enforcement person on the scene (Willem Dafoe) but so little that he can be overlooked.

AMERICAN PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance. It is becoming a cult classic and that designator is well deserved.  Grady Harp, May 12",1337385600,3,2069,4.894285714285714

70056,4,0783243499,"""There are better ways of taking care of Bret Easton Ellis than just censoring him. I would much prefer to see him skinned alive, a rat put up his rectum, and his genitals cut off and fried in a frying pan, in front of - not only a live audience - but a video camera as well. These videos can be sold as ""art"" and ""free expression"" and could be available at every video outlet, library, liquor, and convenience store in the world. We can profit off of Ellis' terror and pain, just as he and bookstores are profiting off of the rape, torture, and mutilation of women.""

This is a comment from feminist activist Tara Baxter concerning Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel American Psycho. Due to its graphic violent content and (mis)perceived misogyny, Ellis' novel has seen its fair share of controversy, including Baxter seeking out copies in book stores to dump blood on them. Naturally, in spite of or because of the controversy the book became a bestseller, which in Hollywood means that it must be acquired to become the next big movie!

Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an average investment banking executive on Wall Street. So average in fact that he's often confused for other executives within the same firm. Underneath the faade lies the heart of a psychopathic killer that he keeps hidden from the rest of the world. As his hatred for the world intensifies, though, his murderous tendencies become more and more apparent.

Satire is something that can be hard to pull off. It must remain subtle while at the same time being clear to viewers that you have a purpose and a message; your subtext should be near the surface but never overt. A lot of times satire is timely, but that doesn't mean that it'll remain timely into the future, so it must also have entertainment value that extends well beyond its perceived time frame. American Psycho does a great job on all of these fronts.

Ellis' book actually is more of a critique on male behavior than a work seeking to lash out at women. Painting with extreme brush strokes makes the comparison more overt, but for those not seeking the true meaning of the piece the subtext is completely lost. The story of a man trying to fit in where he doesn't belong, with a dark streak underneath he keeps hidden from the world becomes a story of an author who is out to demoralize women. One has to wonder how many of American Psycho's detractors actually sat down to analyze the book beyond the violent passages.

The violence in the movie was toned down quite a bit, which is naturally a necessity if you want a rating that still allows you to sell tickets. Don't get me wrong though: this still isn't a movie for the kiddies. The character is still an exaggerated form of the typical misogynist man, but the film focuses more on the inherent humor of the situation rather than on the violence.

Christian Bale is the key here. Bale has a sixth sense for playing characters trying to keep it cool on the outside with turmoil underneath and a secret waiting to be shared with the world, but here there's a bit more levity and comedy to his performance. In particular the scene where he dispatches condescending executive Paul Allen shows his slightly more dark comedic side. Dancing around to Huey Lewis while donning a rain coat and carrying an ax, one can't help but laugh at Bale's manic energy while also questioning if they should.

There's also that intensity that Bale brings to every role that is just kind of creepy disturbing. At one point in the film several executives compare business cards. To the viewer these cards look exactly the same from the paper they're printed on to the font used, but to the execs they all look different with each one being classier than the last. As Bale's Patrick Bateman views these you can see and feel his desperation as each card becomes progressively better than his. With this ""Mine is bigger than yours"" game, Bale demonstrates just how versatile an actor he can be when demonstrating the emotions of someone who doesn't want to be found out for who they really are.

This film is brilliant in its eccentricities and its subtlety within an outrageous casing. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend that you give it a try. Whether you're a fan of Christian Bale, horror, lurid tales, or satire in general this is a must watch, and for some of you out there a must own!

I must have a different Blu-Ray version than others, because I thought the video quality was excellent.  Only one short, dark scene was bad.  The rest of it was great.  Some of the faces looked like plastic though, but that could have been the makeup.  Most of the movie looked very high-def.

The audio soundtracks were a little outdated.  I had the choice of ""English 6.1 DTS ES"" (High Resolution), and ""English Dolby Digital 5.1 EX"".  I selected the DTS, and it was very good, although the movie didn't have a whole lot of surround sound.",1306540800,,643,4.5701754385964914

It's been awhile so I don't remember how long shipping took, but I assume it was a reasonable amount of time as well.

As for the movie itself, the play on Hitchcock's original Psycho isn't serenaded in the course of the film and it has it's own unique story to tell.  One could argue that there are character elements that Norman Bates and Patrick Bateman share with respect to sexual desires and violence against women.  Both characters clearly have ego issues but the most salient point about American Psycho as a movies is how much more visceral and credible Bateman is over Bates.  Bates is easy to dismiss as a fringe character who lives in a rustic motel in the middle of nowhere while Bateman is engages and lives in close contact with ""good society"".

Bateman's ability to maintain his camouflage and traverse the dark streets of society are key to the telling of this story and the difference between Bates and Bateman as Bateman steadily loses his ability to regulate his sadistic impulses.  If it wasn't for the controversial nature of the subject matter, both the film and the novel deserve credit as hallmarks to great cinema and great writing respectively.",1306454400,,1333,4.740259740259741
70059,5,0783243499,"After putting it off for a long time, I finally decided to watch this movie. I haven't read the book, don't really know what the story is all about and if the book is anything like the movie then I gotta tell ya it is a pretty disturbing book. Cuz, this movie was a very disturbing account of a psychotic serial killer's life. It almost felt like reading a journal of a crazy stalker who's completely messed up in the mind except watching it in 3D.

Patrick Batmen (Christian Bale) is a wealthy Newyorker who works as a vice president in a big company. He lives in a multi million dollar apartment, he's extremely obsessed with his looks (and given the way Christian Bale looks in this film I really can't blame him), he graduated from Harvard, loves women, sex and music. Basically, he's your typical Rich New York business man who's very arrogant and hard to like, nothing wrong with that, However what most people don't know is that appearances can be deceiving even more than often. The truth is, what most people don't know and what Patrick tries so hard to keep them ignorant and well succeed is that he's completely ""psycho"". I don't mean that as a phrase, no, he is literary ""Psycho"". Patrick not only is extremely paranoid, and on more than one occasion OCD about his looks. He also loves to go around, in the dark, wander the streets and pick up people, take them to his apartment and then torture them before brutally killing them on the spot and deposing of the body. Talking about guilty pleasure huh ? Apparently, Patrick can't help it. He have these unexplained urges to kill and kill and make people feel the pain and it has gotten so out of control to the point that Patrick is scared of it himself.

I have to tell you, this movie left me paranoid, thinking of crazy serial killers coming out of no where. Pretty scary and sick too. After watching this, I truly understood why parents always tell their kids not to go out with strangers. I'm no longer a kid but I'll never go out with a stranger ! Even if he was as good looking as Christian Bale. Talking about Christian Bale, his performance was Amazing ! The only reason that made me give this movie a 5 instead of a 4, I mean that's just How impressed I was. He totally deserved at least an Oscar Nomination. I don't know who won the Oscar that year but the Oscar committee is gonna be watching this in a couple of years and they're gonna be really sorry for not giving it to him.

I would recommend this movie, ""But"" and a big emphasize on ""BUT"" only if you have an open mind, doesn't freak out on blood and gore (cuz this movie had quite a little and I think some may have issues with that), doesn't mind the drugs and the sex scenes (the drugs weren't as much but the sex scenes..hmm they were revealing even for a Hollywood movie so if you have kids at home don't watch this with your family. I don't know about this cuz I saw the uncut version but the cut version (theoretical release) is still rated a strict (NC-17) which means that you have to be at least 17 to watch this movie.

Anyhow, Great acting, Great filmography, Great directing and I liked the dialog this movie is very quotable. The premise is however disturbing with a Capital D if you have anxiety or get nervous you may not be able to sleep so it's better to stay away from this movie.

70064,5,0783243499,"If you thought the Wall Street crowd who contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 was bad, you should remember the 1980s. You should meet Patrick Bateman

The 80s were  when the children of the 1960s counter-culture baby boomers rejected the values of their parents: chased a life of wealth and status. Coin sized roast pork with tropical lemon mint sauce, kiwi exfoliating body rub, $400 power ties and $15 dollar glasses of vodka were the goodies that the ""yuppies"" used to display and confirm their status.

For Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), these toys were a front for much darker impulses. Bateman has the urge to kill: women, homeless people, rivals at work, anyone that happens to be in his way. Humanity is an annoyance to Patrick, a target for his ice cold, encompassing rage.

His life and the crimes shown in American Psycho are filled with all the trappings and yuppie  rituals: the half hour skin lubricating showers, pricey dinners, and his relationship with the women he plans to marry but cares nothing about.  Buying the best tie, working towards a buff body, torturing a call girl: its all route and all the same to him

All this is treated with brilliant comic darkness: watch how, each time he commits a murder, he first makes a speech about the philosophical implications of vapid 1980s songs like Whitney Houston's ""The Greatest Love Of All"" or Huey Lewis's
""Hip To Be Square."" The violence is ironic and funny:  we are  able to focus on the social satire, not lose the points in moral outrage.

Bateman is empty and narsicistic to his very core, but so is the entire yuppie environment he has chosen. He is in ""murders and executions,"" he reveals when asked. He meant to say ""Mergers and Acquisitions. Lines like this are layered through American Psycho, as if one action is akin to the other.

Bateman's cold killer persona is not unique in this shark pool: he is just the shark big enough to take these instincts to another level. Cutthroat business deals, murder: its all a zero sum game here with sociopath's rules.

70074,5,0783243499,"This movie is great. It is sickeningly disturbing and a great movie that twists your mind. It is a movie where it expounds on the life of a rich wallstret suck up who is going insane, and indeed does crack a little. With a surprising, believable twist, with Ptrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) going on a murder spree. No plot spoilers here, what I said was in the trailers.

The sad, miserable life of this rich man finally empties his soul of what little emotion he had left, where he vents his frustrations on his assistant and on unwitting victims.

Watch the movie to see the suck up go from polite to maniacal. A little too disturbing for my tastes, some parts seemed sad because Christian Bale plays such a supreme performance. I never thought I would have pity for a rich person, let alone a murderer.

Also, they don't have a lot of nudity. What they show are a few porn scenes but with literally one or two butt and boob shots that are about a split second, but I swear they let your imagination FLY. Man. The power of the mind.",1273190400,,1044,4.371134020618556

70076,4,0783243499,"American Psycho stars Christian Bale as the status conscious Patrick Bateman, who is also a ghoulish killing machine. The movie satirizes the yuppie culture of materialism, using a modern day ""Ted Bundy"" serial killer.  American Psycho is set in the 1980's and Patrick Bateman is a broker in New York.  His colleagues are young men his age, who vie for the best business cards, restaurant reservations, ties, and suits.  It all seems so meaningless and sterile as they arrogantly discuss what trendy restaurant to eat dinner at each night at a local club.

Patrick Batemen lives in a expensive New York apartment and starts each morning with a shower and narcissistic regimen of skin care.  He is misogynistic, and self centered, spending time with same-aged colleagues sharing a obsession over classy business cards, designer glasses, ties and suits.  His public personality hides a murderous rage at small frustrations.  When his anger mounts then it is taken out on anyone, including his do-worker, prostitutes, homeless men and models.  During the murders he plays music and critiques the songs of Huey Lewis and Phil Collins.  Chloe Sevigny plays Patrick's secretary and Reese Witherspoon plays his fiance.  Both are wonderful actresses and give the movie some depth.  Although there are many murders in the movie, the actual killing scenes are not graphic, although plenty of blood and bodies are seen throughout.  Patrick gets away with everything with his public persona - clean cut professional - just like Ted Bundy.  Even as Patrick is loading a full body bag in the car a friend comes up and comments what a gorgeous bag - is it Armani?  Patrick grunts and groans as he puts the body in the trunk and responds the correct designer.  There is no one who really suspects him, and he has a lawyer who covers his trial when an outside detective starts asking questions.  He is highly protected  in a world of money and style.

American Psycho is a great satire on Yuppie culture.",1270339200,,1987,4.915915915915916
70077,5,0783243499,"I've been a big Bale fan ever since the release of his 2000 film, American Psycho. Before that, I really didn't understand any of his work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was in American Psycho where Christian Bale's presence became more apparent. I think the scene where he chops Jared Leto up is the actor's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three scenes. Christy, take off your robe. Watch the brilliant ensemble acting of Witherspoon, Mathis and Dafoe. You can practically hear every nuance of every voice. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of thespian craftsmanship, the sheer delivery, this movie hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the scene with Chloe Sevigny. In this scene, Christian Bale addresses the problems of abusive political authority. Him trying to feed a kitten into an ATM machine is the most moving film scene of the 2000s about monogamy and commitment. The scene is extremely uplifting. The lines are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in movies. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your *beep*. Christian Bale's solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially movies like The Machinist and The Prestige. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Christian Bale works best within the confines of this movie than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is American Psycho, a great, great movie. A personal favorite.

70079,4,0783243499,"Updated review: I now have read the book, and it made me realize that this is a genius interpertation by the astute filmmakers! Tackling this massive, bitterly cynical satirical (and at times boring) book, and giving it a focus, heart, and soul is nothing short of amazing! I congratulate the filmmakers and upgrade my review from three to four star ratings.

Initial review prior to reading the book: I never read the book but intend to now. I really never had interest in seeing this movie because I utterly despise horror movies which I thought this is. As it started to unfold I said to my wife this is not a horror film, but a sophsticated  New York thriller (not realzing the writer was British). The dialogue impressed me (I didn't know it came from the book). I loved him taking offense to the anti-Semitic remaks of his idiot Wall Street colleague. Then I wondered how Bateman can carry a dead body across the lobby trailing blood and nothing happened. Then it became so absurd I started to lay back and laugh because it was so over the top. It took until the closing scenes(visit to what we thought was Paul's apartment) for me to finally realize that we've been cleverly manipulated and all the murders were all in Bateman's head, fantasies. Then I finally realized it was a twisted satire. Now I need to see it all again to sure, but after I read the book. The social commentary was kinda lost but I thought the music trivia was great, fitting in with Tarantino's and TV influenced writing which resorts to a lot of off-the-nose trivia. Do I recommend this film? Yes. If you haven't read the book, it's grippng in its own twisted way and Bale is great. You really believe he's crazy, which he is, even if find out later it's all in his head. It's weird but simultaneously brilliant filmmaking.",1266710400,,1805,4.567901234567901

Mary Harron's take on Bret Easton Ellis's masterpiece is amazing, and Christian Bale brings the character of Patrick Bateman to life like none other. The brutal acts juxtaposed with Patrick's cool nonchalance is profoundly disturbing and creepy. If you haven't seen the movie, buy it at once.

As far as the Blu Ray version goes? Skip it. The intro with the white background looks absolutely horrible on Blu Ray.

This is a very shoddy Blu-ray release.  The transfer is ugly.  It looks like an upconverted DVD.  In fact, if you have an upconvert DVD player with an HDMI cable, I wouldn't even bother replacing your old DVD copy.  The blacks are often not black enough, the colors not crisp enough.  There is noticeable grain and a lack of clarity we expect from blu-rays.

This is a great movie but it deserves a better blu-ray than this, as it is ordinarily a beautifully shot film.

I gave it three stars, because it is a great movie and for $10, this is a good starter for a budding Blu-ray collection.  Just don't expect to get the most out of your HD system with this.  Many older films (Deliverance, Face/Off, Batman, others) look much better.

70100,5,0783243499,"Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is your everyday Wall Street exec. He works for his fathers company, even though he doesn't really have to. He compares business cards with fellow friends and makes reservations at the newest and hottest restaurants... just because. He has a body every man wants and every girl wants to touch. He's meticulous and anal in everything he does. He's also a homicidal maniac. He kills for fun and he kills for release and he kills for hatred. After one of his murders though, a homicide cop begins too get a little too close for comfort of figuring out that Patrick could be the killer and Patrick begins to unravel from his calm demeanor.

Never having read the book the movie is based on; I went into this movie blind. And loved it. It was a lot of fun to listen to his Patrick's narration of who he is and what he is. Like when he's talking about his facial mask. As he begins to peel it off after 10 minutes of having it on, you really just cant help see him telling us that what is on his outside is not who he is on the inside. He's not your friend. Not your coworker. Not your lover. He's a friggin soulless killer. It is crazy to think that someone could be so cold and emotionless, but yet there are people out there that are like that. I don't believe for a second that he got 100% pleasure out of all of his kills. Some seemed like he just couldn't help it. Like we might go get a massage, have sex, or just sit on the beach for some relaxation. He would kill.

Not only is the movie just crazy good, it's also pretty funny. Dark funny though. Seeing him get massively pissed off over someone's business cards is too funny. And not in the ha-ha kind of funny way, but in the `holy crap he's getting pissed over nothing' kind of way. And flexing in the mirror while having sex with two girls? Legendary. And chasing someone down a hallway, butt nekid except for high tops, and a chainsaw? Once again... Legendary. And when he says things out loud such as ""I'm into murders and executions"" and someone doesn't really hear him and thinks he says `mergers and acquisitions'...that's just funny. There are just a lot of funny lines in this movie, but dark funny guys. I love how he tells people he will kill them, but you know he means it...lol.

Christian Bale is a pretty good actor for sure. I love how he seems different in all his parts he plays. Not a lot different, but he just is. It's almost subtle, but he's not really ever the same. But one thing for sure is that good gracious God blessed that man with a crazy metabolism or something. I'm not gay, but the man has a great body. And to do what he does with it is crazy. I'll never forget the way he looked like a dang holocaust victim in The Mechanist and then like a few months later he was Batman or something. Crazy.

P.S. - So I'm not afraid to say I don't understand the ending. I can't tell what was going on at the end. Is he a killer for real...or is it in his head? For instance...he blew up a cop car with a pistol. Even he looked at his gun like `wtf?' And then after his confession, even his lawyer said he was kidding around. Was he? Or was the lawyer covering for him? I was confused. Anyone want to help me out? I tried not to say much, so spoilers ahead if there needs to be in the comments!",1237939200,4,3304,4.223101265822785

It took Brett Ellis's novel then made it rated R. If there was a true film adaption then it would most surely be rated X. But this was a really good version of the book.
Christan Bale playes Patrick Bateman who's an ego mniacal wall street broker that specializes in mergers and aquisitions, though if you ask him he would tell you that he does murders and exicutions mostly. He plays the perfect man, with the perfect body, that is living out the American dream of fame and fortune. But he has a much more dark and sinister side in the night he will go out, torture, rape, and kill people ranging from the hooker to his coworkers.
This is definitly not for people that don't want to see anything gross. He eats people and smears them on the walls of his apartment.

I could talk about the movie in 'critic' terms.
Terms which are related to the analysis of certain elements and aspects of the movie.
However since in my opinion such analysis is utter hogwash, I'll just give my generalview.
Bateman was a master of fitting in. He possessed all of the qualities needed to succeed in 'society'.
Yet, internally he loathed the very world that he was proficient in, and his only release was violence and raw passion.

I think this movie can apply to any and all eras.
Many of us know people who seem to rise to the top in society.
Who seem to have a diamond chakra when it comes to luck and occurrence.
While many others do just enough to maintain.
But are those at the top all happy?

To my utter delight. It was a mixture of all three listed items. It was a horror in all of its fantasmic images, but it was also satirical. I laughed at several parts of the movie and cringed when I knew another death was coming! If you see it, you'll know what I mean. And of course the film is explicit, graphic in its sexual presentation. But that's only to further emphasize how utterly lost and dominant that man has truly become. For instance, he can't even handle the fact that another man 'has' a better business card than him. You can see it each time on his face.

There was another thing that got me. The man is crying out for help, crying out to be heard in all of the insanity that he's either brought on other people, but also, himself.

I've watched this movie once, but I will be watching it again, and again, and again...This coming from someone who vowed never to see it because of its alleged contents! It's a very cool movie.

Fact is, I only got this movie because Christian Bale was in it and I've been collecting his other movies since The Dark Knight.

Oh! The ending. Well, that's just something that you'll have to sort out for yourself (not giving anything away, grins). But it's definitely something to see (you must rent or buy this movie!).

70120,4,0783243499,"This movie shows violence toward women, men and the narrow escape of a kitten from an ATM machine.

Ahhhhhhh!  What can I say?  Christian Bale is an incredible actor and his portrayal of Patrick Bateman in ""American Psycho"" is unforgettable.  Bale's Patrick Bateman is drop-dead gorgeous, cut, successful, swaggering, demented, obsessed and, of course, p-s-y-c-h-o. And comedic in a very, very dark way.  His livingroom scene with Jared Leto (his nemesis in the movie) is so disturbing you DO indeed catch yourself grinning.  Patrick's obsession with Jared Leto's character AND business cards, helps the viewer understand that Patrick is not just insanely jealous -- he IS insane.

Women in this movie are just meat for Patrick's grinder.  He enjoys killing.  Women are easy to kill.  He has easy access to women so, hey, why not slaughter them?  The types of women he attracts are apparently  as shallow as he is with the exception of the street prostitute who you will probably feel sympathy for.

If anyone begins this movie envying or admiring Patrick Bateman and still does at the end of the movie, I would suggest they too are crazy.  Patrick is probably every human being's worst nightmare.  The guy takes himself and his position in life WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.  He indulges his every desire (mostly sadistic).  He is a leech.  A vampire.  He takes and gives nothing back.  You can knock on his door and nobody's home.  He is  only happy in someone else's skin.

If you enjoy his performance in the Batman movies, this is where it all comes and stems from.  Bale has always been great at getting inside of the character and showing what the character is made of.

The book that the movie was based on was meant to be a commentary on the 1980's.  The arrogance, hubris, and lack of empathy that the business world felt to the smaller man.  The lead protagonist, Patrick Bateman (played by Bale), is a yuppie turned serial killer.  He causing pain and suffering in different levels (real and imagined) to those around him.  It's a brilliant dark comedy (though I'm sure my grandparents wouldn't find it the least bit funny).

American Psycho roles out and in the end you don't know what is true, what is is imagined, and what is a lie.  Did the whole film happen in his head?  Was there a cover-up?  Should he have fed the ATM the kitten?  All in all it was a fun romp.  I've owned it on VHS and DVD, and I'll probably upgrade to Blu-Ray if I ever manage to bring myself to go all next gen.

There are some sexually explicit scenes and violence.  That aside, Bale plays the perfect looking, perfectly chisled, perfectly groomed Patrick Bateman to perfection. The man behind the perfect mask is truly psychotic.  Bale is genious in this role.  I saw that Leonardo Decaprio was supposed to play the part and I cant imagine anyone playing Batemen like Bale.  He is the best actor out there and dedicated to his craft which makes him fascinating to watch.  When he is on screen in any film, it is impossible to watch anyone else, not just because of his obvious good looks, but because it seems he becomes the character.

70133,3,0783243499,"In all honesty, the first three quarters of `American Psycho' is flawless.  I have made my distain for this film obvious to many people but upon reflection even I must admit that the majority of its parts are pure brilliance.  And then the fourth quarter comes along and then entire film falls to pieces.  Honestly I don't think that Mary Harron understood Bret Easton Ellis' novel.  I am a huge fan of the book (I have it listed as one of the top five books everyone should own) and have learnt to embrace its controversial and disturbing overtones because underneath it all `American Psycho' (the novel) is a masterful depiction of humanity at its realist.  I know that it has been noted that Ellis' enjoyed this movie adaptation, and maybe that should mean something for me, but I still can't help but gawk at its overly comical ending.

When you read `American Psycho' it gets under your skin; first because of the gross and graphic depictions of murder and mayhem, but ultimately it crawls beneath you because you begin to rationalize with inhumanity.  You begin to realize that this man is trapped, as are you and I, in a world that places so much value on the clothes we wear and the toys we own that the value of another's life is tragically degraded.  What garners more attention; the murder of a homeless man or a blowout sale at JCPenney?  The answer is as obvious as it is heartbreaking.

Mary Harron's adaptation loses that for me.  In the end Patrick Bateman is degraded to the depiction of a crazed lunatic as apposed to the ultimate portrayal of a society lost.  He's made fun of as apposed to being made fear-inspiring.  I vividly remember an image of a crouched over Christian Bale feasting on human flesh and I remember shaking my head in disgust for what Ellis' brilliant work of modern literature had been reduced to.

This has nothing to do with the fantastic acting within this film, which I feel compelled to point out.  Christian Bale serves up one of the greatest performances of his career and certainly one of the best of that given year (can you say Oscar snub).  He truly gets inside Patrick Bateman, residing within his delusions and creating a truly terrifying as well as understandable character.  Chloe Sevigny also delivers as Bateman's secretary Jean.  Her scene within his apartment, the scene with the nail gun, is my favorite scene in the film.  Reese Witherspoon is great here, if not underused, and Jared Leto has one of the most memorable scenes here (the one scene in the film that really crawled beneath my skin).

You know, while I'm on that subject I might as well stay on that subject.  Jared Leto plays Paul Allen, one of Bateman's `victims'.  The murder scene is graphic yet done in a mesmerizing satirical way that truly captures what Ellis' novel was all about.  Why oh why could the climax of this film have been done in the same splendid manner?  I'm baffled because one scene is pure brilliance while the other is C-Grade cheesiness.

I just want to throw my hands up in dire frustration.

In the end I guess I'm forced to give this the thumbs down.  It could have been such a fantastic film; maybe even the best of the year.  The source material, while completely and understandably controversial and offensive, is one of the greatest and most influential novels to have ever been penned.  Mary Harron had a major opportunity here to build on greatness and deliver something the world has never seen.  A lot of critics praised this movie; which goes to show that I will never understand this society's idea of a critic.  It begins with such masterful potential and it builds on it with such fire only to freefall into stupidity and destroys everything it worked so hard to accomplish.  I give it three stars, nothing more and nothing less; which is sad because during its first three quarters I was so sure it would receive nothing but praise from me.  Bale is genius, I will give this movie that, but even his brilliance could not save this film from itself.",1207008000,3,4014,4.632248939179632

70150,5,0783243499,"This movie is incredible in all regards. It involves the American Dream and how it has been corrupted. It shows the dark side of the yuppie culture of the 80s that no one could have ever anticipated. We see how pathetic, meaningless, and insane wealth and image can turn our lives. We get all of this in the form of Patrick Bateman, the successful Wall Street executive with chiseled abs and a model girlfriend. He lives in a society where the costliness of suits, the beauty of business cards, the quality of cocaine, and the number of women banged matter more than character and personality. In this culture, one gets friends by having the latest Huey Lewis and the News CD, the most posh designer suits, and the most enviable haircut. The fact that Patrick Bateman's violent crimes against humanity go unnoticed by his peers shows just how our MTV culture has desensitized us to the real issues of our world, such as war, poverty, disease, social injustice, etc. If you were happy enough living with your fellow Wall Street buddies, would you really care about the Africans with AIDS?
In this movie, Patrick commits the most horrendous of crimes. He kills homeless men, prostitutes, a cat, and even an old woman. He revels in the amount of blood that he lets flow. The sex in this movie is relatively intense and ""sadistic."" After all, women are like designer suits for Patrick: things that you can dispose of as you please. However, the blood and sex in this movie are nowhere as disturbing or graphic as they are in the original novel.
Many people argue about whether those around Patrick don't know what he does simply because it's ""all in his head"" or whether the yuppie culture simply could care less about violent crime (meaning that Patrick actually commits the portrayed crimes). I feel that the answer is both. The shallowness of our modern society desensitizes us to our real problems and consequently distorts our perception of reality. This new fake reality is one of greed, lust, jealousy, frustration, and endless longing.
The beauty of this movie lies in how much it still applies to modern society. Though we don't live in the 80s, we still have many of the same problems of the 80s, including AIDS, drugs, warfare, and poverty. We still live in a MTV culture that has evolved into one of reality television. Many of us eagerly watch shows like ""The Simple Life."" Knowing full well of the growing gap between rich and poor, so many people still envy the lazy lifestyle of frauds like Britney Spears. An interview with Paris Hilton can beat out an interview about health care on Larry King. Is that how shallow our society is? Frankly, YES. Many people still have little knowledge of the upcoming presidential election. Obviously, though, some Hollywood actor's new haircut matters so much, right? I may be ranting, but this is the reality of modern America. If you think that America has changed for the better, you are wrong.
Anyway, this is a brilliant movie, especially with regards to acting. As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale pulled off a sensational yet realistic performance that was so enthralling and eye-pleasing that he should have won an Oscar for his actor. It is very difficult to give a performance that requires the right balance between being suave and being sinister. The other actors are all perfect. Reece Witherspoon plays Bale's snotty and lousy girlfriend and does superbly well.
People label this movie as horror. It should be considered a black comedy. One cannot but help laughing during the business card, Paul Allen, and stray cat scenes, all of which are brilliantly crafted.
If you like this movie, I recommend the original novel and any other Christian Bale movies (e.g. Empire of the Sun, Batman Begins, and The Prestige).",1199318400,3,3774,4.825617283950617

Ethan Windom, a 16-yr.old boy, brutally murdered his 42-yr. old mother on January 25, 2007. The murderer was ""obsessed with the book and film, 'AMERICAN PSYCHO,' copying the mannerisms of the main character Patrick Bateman, going so far as to try to cover up his mother's murder almost exactly as described in the book.""
""Police learned during interviews and the investigation about Windom's fascination with 'AMERICAN PSYCHO' and serial killers. In the film, Patrick Bateman works on Wall Street by day but at night kills for no reason at all. Police learned from his friends that Windom had emulated the Bateman character since eighth grade.
Police say they also discovered he copied the character in the book by:
+Wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase at times.
+Obsessing over material possessions and luxury items, like Jean Paul Gaultier bags and designer bags and designer cologne. In fact Windom asked for his expensive cologne after he confessed to the murder.
+Asking police for his white comforter in his jail cell, similar to the character's comforter.
+Taking two showers a day and appying a cosmetic face mask after the first shower, just like the film character.
+Snorting his medication through a dollar bill like the character snorted cocaine in the film.
+Windom had a figurine of Bateman in his bedroom. He told people he had homicidal thoughts, just like the character did. And like the character in the film, Windom told police he planned to kill some bums Downtown, but he killed his mother instead because she was closer.
+Police also said Windom had several books about serial killers in his room and had taken an upper level psychology class as a sophomore in high school.
+Police also found a day planner in the Windom home with seven graphic pictures Window drew of women being brutally murdered with knives, ropes and chain saws.""

He seems like a perfect man for any woman but underneath that skin he is a vicious coldblooded murderer that loves taunting, raping and mutilating his victims especially keeping their bodies in the closet but how long can he bring back his sanity?

A chilling and ultraviolent horror thriller based on a novel is quite an interesting and gory satire on yuppies in the 80's, there's quite a bit of sex such as the gorgeous Reese Weitherspoon half naked in one scene and of course graphic violence like nailgun massacres, chainsaw murders and that kind of thing. The film co-stars Jared Leto, Josh Lucas and William Defoe in fine acting roles in this picture, it's one of the best horror-thrillers of the 2000's and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre plus the soundtrack is great.

It's only significant difference is that it leaves out some of the more gruesome scenarios in Ellis's book.  I'm not sure whether that's a drawback or not but there was some rage missing in our killer's actions.  The film operates as a first person narrative and contains the same kind of oddball combinations of extreme violence and dark humor.  This kind of humor is exactly my kind of humor, so I laughed at American Psycho throughout.  Mary Harron also seemed to recognize that the novel was old enough that she should approach the film as a period piece and she executes this well.  Everything about this movie feels like the late 1980s.  She creates a virtual remake of the novel as I pictured it in my head years ago.  From what I understand Harron also fought hard to keep the role of Patrick Bateman (the title character and the story's protagonist) in the capable hands of Christian Bale.  Bale is outstanding here and Harron really seems to be a directorial force with her actors.

Patrick Bateman is a 27 year-old wealthy and successful investor.  He is clearly a product of a privileged and ultra-competitive background.  We follow him around and listen to all of his observations of the world he lives in.  This is of course the yuppie culture of the 1980s. Perhaps Bateman is the extreme yuppie and a harbinger to the ills of this socially produced subgroup and the culture they exist in.  As it turns out his world features the substantiality that he is indeed a murderer.  Unfortunately no one seems to notice this, despite his blatant and at times hilariously dry claims that he is a psycho.  Evidence of his murders also seemed to disappear quite easily.  American Psycho, like the novel, is a great satire that might leave viewers with some frustrating questions in the end.  What was real and what was imaginary?

The rest of the cast includes Wilem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chlo Sevigny, and Reese Witherspoon.  All are fairly effective within their roles but the film weighed heavily on Bale's performance.  He understands Patrick Bateman and makes the character the mind-blowingly shallow and overly competitive monster he is.

The thing that surprises most is that a great female director like Harron decided to take on a story so pervasively accused of misogyny.  Harron's other films are about a radical feminist (Valerie Salanas in I Shot Andy Warhol) and an icon of women's liberation (Bettie Page in The Notorious Bettie Page).  I almost think she intentionally went against the grain here to break out of the mold Hollywood can often create for women and minority directors.  Good for her.

70196,1,0783243499,"Mary Harron butchered one of my favorite books in the world. A literary giant. A book that defies so many conventional styles of writing, and set the pace for so many other budding artist to open their minds eye up to paper and spill all. I was horrified beyond explanation, and after initiallly viewing the film, which I waited two years plus to see because of fear of said deplorability, I sent her agent a letter detailing in 'no uncertian terms' how I felt about her talents, or lackthereof.

Let me begin, and I am hoping you reader, you avid movie afficioando, will have an open eye to my view and not shoot me down with a check in the unhelpful column.  Remember this is just one movie lovers review, but it is *mine* nonetheless. Just one person's opinion on the transformation or migration, if you will from print to 35, just like one would certainly not go see a film based on what Gene Siskel or Shalit would say, or even A.O.  Scott (Heavens to Betsy), would say. We see the films we love or despise in our own unique ways.

So with that said, if you read the book, and instantly, no immediately, no almost compulsively read it in one sitting, and then read it again, and again and again, and shared it with others who gave you strange  looks, or read it on the metro in Montreal or the filthy NR train to do your own bloodstained shirts downtown in NYC, and then realized that you have this work of pure metaphysical art next to your bedstand, and you stick it routinely in a napsack or the like, and for some reason or another you have 'YET' to rent or buy this DVD: ""DONT."" I strongly encourage you, from one Ellis lover to another, hold off. Your Pat Bateman and the like, the characters you know and love and cherish and adore,  the scenes you have built up and played out in your minds eye time and time again, the pages that you have highlighted and doggy eared, the paragraphs which you have transformed over to myspace in perhaps your 'About Me' section, and the underlining on endless tabs of dazzling, dancing prose, that make Psycho what it was, will be sledgehammered, and you will wonder why it happened, who let it happen, and perhaps, like I was, be angry you saw it.

Now I don't know what Ellis thought about Ms. Haron's version of this or even worse transforming of prose to film, the focal point of this reviewer, however the blame should lie ENTIRELY with her, not only from a directors standpoint, but from the dual roll as well as writer. Just like the most important part of reading a book in English from another language is obviously the translation, (Hamsun's 'Hunger' comes to mind, the others don't touch his translation) such should be that of the dual role of Ms. Harron.

Now everyone has their own interpretation of Ellis' masterpiece, some take the novel very seriously, and compare it to some of the finest novels of our time, others, like Norman Mailer for instance, compare his writing style to that of Dostoyevski, and the reader can think it's a farce from the getgo with the satirical portrayal of Manhattan in the 80's and the stink, stank, stunk of the city that everyone knows 'how filthy it really is'. Yes, often times you wonder if in fact this murdering lifestyle Ellis' main character Pat Bateman delves into, is simply a figment of a warped mind, a sociopathic troubled yuppy, who would like to at times lash out at the world, and slice the throats of not only pathetic street urchins and flaming homosexuals, but also friends, coworkers and family alike.

However, I took the book a bit more seriously. Ellis' amazing eye to detail in the murder scenes, and the exceptional tools he uses to craft out his work, is sheer brilliance. Ellis practically hands down nails 80's socialities in Manhattan. He nails their bravado, their ostentatiousness, their melancholy, ignorance of the downtrodden 'others' and his overt drug usage in the novel, placated with his having to look immacaulate with people that he surrounds himself with, who in turn have to look immaculate, is DEAD ON, and they did try hard to make that portrial come through in the film. The pretentiousness and thinking they have a better pot to piss in exist even moreso today (look at the pathetic Lindsey Lohan's, Paris Hilton's and Nicole Richie's of the world).

The movie was portrayed too much as a farce. The dining scenes and dialouge are so brilliantly executed in the novel and sadly Ms. Harris misses almost every fine turn and trick in those conversations, including, but certainly not limited to the multiple 'Bellini' Orders that keep coming to the table, the red snapper scene which carries over to multiple chapters, trying to secure tables at A List restaurants last minute, Bateman's inner turmoil. I mean you kind of see it, (the business card scene comes to mind, which was not done that badly, for in that scene in itself we so how something as truly insignificant as raised brail on a card, can be so utterly important and top priority in these mens lives), yet it's not tangible to this viewer. I want to see Bateman cringing and screaming inside, and rarely do we see that in the film. The secretaries roll of Jean (played lacklustery by Chlo Sevigny), was third rate Ishtarian. Jean is a very important role, and at times I find, at least in the book, that Pat's feelings for Jean he stating he may eventually marry her, are quite genuine.

There is one scene in the book where Bateman and I think that goof Van Patten and Craig McDermott, who is tres hip, are in the Yale Club and the flamboyant Carruthers is sitting a few tables away, and he (Bateman) is talking about what it would be like if Luis was eradicated. Would Courtney like him less if Luis was gone, what would it be like, and in his charade about killing Luis he talk about the war in Namibia with the Soviets, and through all this he ends with thinking about hacking Luis to death. There is nothing really humorous about that, disturbing and certainly sadistic, and that is exactly what Bateman is thinking. In the Yale Club at that exact moment he would love to just cold out murder Luis and watch his blood drain from his body, that in all surreal innuendo, is freakin brilliant.

To think how many of us, (it's ok I will say it), want to just dump a body in a river sometimes, because of some of the assanine, trite people we share the earth with. It's human emotion, hate is an emotion.

Those types of emotions garnered by Ellis and this reader did not come through in the film. It was rushed, lacked depth and character development. The exchanges between the detective, played suprisingly unbrilliantly by William Dafoe were adolescent; and the social scenes, although they were immaculately dead on with the clothes and the spit-spot looks and demeanors of the characters, the cohesion was flat and uninspiring.

Then they went and defiled Ellis again by making American Psycho 2.

In contrast, and to close, Christian Bale is a brilliant actor, his role as young Jim in Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"" is one of the most brilliant performances in cinema, and he did a fine job playing often emotionless and dead on 'mentally deranged' Pat Bateman. If they had a different director let's, say ""Brian De Palma,"" and a brilliant screenwriter (Ted Tally comes to mind), with a more interesting ensemble cast, this could have been a masterpiece.",1180483200,6,7365,4.620030581039756

70198,5,0783243499,"The release of American Psycho in 2000 was accompanied by many an outraged editorial about the gore-fest nature and loathsome treatment of women in the script.  It created a sensation, and although most editorialists got it completely wrong, I do applaud them for creating a buzz around this outstanding film.  Director Mary Harron transports the viewer to Manhattan in the 1980's, impeccably re-creating the outfits, interior dcor, snotty theme restaurants, and modern art of the time.  The main characters consist of Patrick Bateman and his fellow Wal Street merger and acquisition Vice Presidents, all of whom sit in their offices looking important and dreaming up ways to one-up the other with new business card fonts or current event tid-bits.  They date socialites who are either zonked out on drugs or working hard climbing the right social ladders.

Patrick is, of course, an American Psycho.  He's a fastidious, narcissistic serial killer.  He doesn't limit himself to just women, but the most fantastic scenes in the movie occur when he kills beautiful model-types.  The movie has a very simple and very powerful message:  Patrick is deranged, but so is everyone around him.  Everyone is as soul-less as Patrick, and when he tries to confess his crimes, the vacuous nature of his world renders his confession unbelievable to all his friends and associates.  There is a Realtor, in fact, who proves herself to be far more deranged than Patrick, and she commits no outright crime.

This movie is a brilliant satire of a period piece.  The gore is mainly off-screen and subtle, and the murders are almost campy (Patrick running around condo hallways naked save for sneakers and a bloody chainsaw, anyone?).",1178755200,2,1713,5.096774193548387
70199,4,0783243499,"While I believe that the book is masterfully written, I kept asking myself when I was reading it whether Ellis had a deal with the Devil - who dictated to him the confessions of the worst serial killer ever.

It is a brilliant description of the 80s - you can hear them, see them, almost touch them, they practically scream at you from the pages; and dark portrait of the 80-th golden boy who went on the rampage.

I did not think that there were one woman in the world who would enjoy that book; To admire it, to respect it - yes but to enjoy it...

Well, there was one woman, Mary Harron, who liked and respected AP so much that she decided to transform it to the screen - and it worked. She cut down on the gore and sex and concentrated on the satire. I liked the film when I saw it first time; I love it now after the second viewing. Surprisingly restrained and funny - it has one of the best scenes I've seen in the films lately - the war of credit cards.

The show belongs to Christian Bale - and he delivers as Patrick Bateman, the rich and beautiful 26 year old Wall Street banker with the secrets so dark that he makes Dr. Lector look like a Sesame Street character. Bale's cold, charismatic, misogynist turn is riveting.

70201,5,0783243499,"Who is Patrick Bateman?

A valid question for those reading this review.  One must wonder if he is the socially elite of the New York business world, the prime example of an obsessive compulsive, or the face of evil itself with an endless expense account and an unquenched need to kill - kill - and kill again.  Just like the illusive Tootsie-Roll Pop, the world may never know.  Bret Easton Ellis penned him, director Mary Harron gave him the paved road, while Christian Bale gave us the face, the mannerisms, and the world of the unknown Bateman.  For those unfamiliar, Bateman is a new sort of serial killer.  Not quite the BTK or Bundy, but the terror certainly ranges from within.  Living in a posh apartment, eating at the fanciest of restaurants, and enjoying all the pleasures of 1980s New York, Bateman struggles with himself and the need to kill time and time again.  His victims, mostly prostitutes and business cohorts, suffer the worst (far worse in the book) punishments alive either from ax, nail gun, hanger, or the ever popular chainsaw.  Pulling from pop culture, dark obsessions, and eerily our own desires, Bateman shows no conscious, no compassion, no rational thought for these crimes, he just kills and kills and kills.

Where this film takes a different element than you a-typical slasher film or horror genre is that midway through you begin to question the sanity of our anti-hero.  Events transpire that catch both Bateman as well as the viewers off-guard.  The biggest question is Paul Allen.  The phenomenally understated Jared Leto delivers a mirror performance to Bale's as another suit in the business world.  Due to accounts and business cards, Bateman dissolves the friendship - yet, everyone continues to see Allen walking the streets and having lunch with him.  Even the detective hired for the case, one Donald Kimball (played by Willem Dafoe) seems to prove otherwise.  Yet, something nags at our belief.  This is only confirmed with an ending that will make you stop, rewind, and watch again.  Questing everything from the mouth of Bateman, as well as his surroundings.  Slasher film?  Um, this reviewer would rather place it into the genre of self-discovery.  There was a film entitled ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" that attempts to understand the meaning of life, but for me, ""American Psycho"" can do it like no other.

For anyone looking for that film that contains an amazing score, an ensemble of known actors giving us performances of a lifetime, and direction that both mimics and mocks the lifestyle in New York during the 80s - than ""American Psycho"" is the film for you.  For me, I don't understand why it isn't further a staple of the film community.  Christian Bale could not have been a better choice for the face of Bateman, his ability to transform himself into the character was outstanding.  His character wasn't over the top, nor was it Bale being a character - he was Patrick Bateman.  What is it with Bale - there hasn't been one underscored performance yet.  ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"", ""Velvet Goldmine"", and the ""Machinist"" are all within my top films of all time.  ""American Psycho"" ranks above them all.  Scenes, for me, that stand out are (2) major ones.  The first, which proves that Mary Harron was the perfect choice to direct and that her decision to cast Jared Leto was directly on target is the scene with Leto and Bale as he prepares the ax and explains the lyrical juxtaposition of Huey Lewis.  The language, the motions, and the choreography of the scene remains in my eyes, one of the strongest in cinema history.  The second scene, while less cinematically inclined, is that of Bale running naked through the halls of his apartment, dawning only his tennis shoes (naked to the bone), with chain a-blazin' as he chases one of the escaping prostitutes.  Again, maybe not the best in history, but a scene that constantly makes me laugh, shiver in terror, and remain in awe of the skill  known as Christian Bale.

I would go so far as to say that this is a flawless film.  As I watch this film for the dozenth time, I cannot find errors in the filmmaking.  Perhaps there errors with continuity, but I don't pay attention.  I look at the overall value of the film, and this is a cult film, hands down.  I must admit, the only issue that I have trouble with is the ever lacking bonus features on this disc.  I have the original version released and it only has a handful of extras which are not anything to overly write about, but what ergs me is the ever lacking audio commentary that would have been great to hear about this story.  Perhaps it would have included a bit more about the ending, less fog surrounding it, but not to worry - there is a newer version, the ""Uncut Killer's Collector's Edition"" that should remedy all of these missing elements.

Overall, ""American Psycho"" ranks among one of my favorite films of all time.  While my list constantly grows, this remain a constant.  I cannot speak any higher of Bale, or of Harron's direction which continues to impress me during each viewing.  The music is what stood out in my eyes.  There is a scene where someone laughs half-heartedly at a comment made by Bateman about liking Whitney Houston.  I loved his interpretation of a Phil Collins song.  It was these small elements that all came together perfectly for this film.  ""American Psycho"" is a look within the business soul.  As I watched this film, I thought of it as an extension to the ""Wall Street"" arm, could  Gordon Gekko be Patrick's father?  The insanity of New York, the pressures of working in a constantly obliterating corporate world, the standards of humanity - all blend together just far enough to make you question the existence of the man sitting next to you.  For anyone who has ever worked for Corporate America - this is the film for you.

70204,4,0783243499,"I would argue that since we really haven't evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out. And despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace. In Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" it comes out in all the wrong places. The film is a character study of one Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a Wall Street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night. Patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him. It's not just the suits and the empty conversations either. It is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card. He tries to talk about his problems, he really does, but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period. To their ears ""Murders and Executions"" is interchangeable with ""Mergers and Acquisitions.""

The film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980's. This particular Gordon Gekko is overdone and overacted by Christian Bale in a great performance. He is robotic, phony, arrogant and absurd. He is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so (all the while flexing his biceps). More than anything he is militantly materialistic. He is Dexter mixed with Jim Profit, only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co-workers head. The whole point, which is made clear in the final scene, is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts. Just because these people make enough cash to swim in, Scrooge McDuck style, doesn't mean that their behavior is excusable. Harron paints the modern businessman as an American Psycho, and it is all too fitting. To make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off, you must be turned into Patrick Bateman.

The film is a great success. As a horror movie villain Patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever. Every scene has great energy to it and even though Bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you can't stop watching him. There is something of a conflict presented when Willem Dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of Patrick's murders. That storyline is interesting while it lasts, but it is never quite wrapped up. I would also admit that after awhile I got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters. He may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but I eventually did. The character is endlessly fascinating (what is up with his love of cheesy 80's music?) and the scene where he kills Paul Allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized. The male need for aggression isn't going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it. . .otherwise we are going to have a lot more Patrick Bateman's and Iraq Wars on our hands. ***3/4",1174089600,3,2974,4.557009345794392

Christian Bale is one nutty dude in this movie.

The world of Yuppies. One has to be better than the next, and higher up is where they all strive to be.

Who has better looking, more expensive business cards for one example.

It's about how money rules who these young men really are in the corporate world. One is so infatuated with himself that he actually gets crazy about it and starts to kill.

He kills one acquaintance of his who he really doesn't know, and takes him for another person. Of course Jared Leto is a very nose in the air kind of personality as his friends all are, and gets killed in this movie to, and he is actually the first murder victim.

His place is also where Christian's character goes to lure in his victims and where he also hides them.

That's the joke behind American Psycho, which follows a killer at large during the 1980s junk-bond boom. Bateman (Christian Bale) takes pathological pride in everything from his business card to his Huey Lewis CD collection, all the while plotting his next victim's vivisection. Parts of this film should not be controversial: sleek photography, a good score, great acting by the supporting cast, and deft directing. Two areas that ARE controversial: Bale's acting and the story itself. Black satire, including American Psycho, is a legitimate theme as are serial killers. Character studies can explore questions like Who am I? What is inside me? etc., as does this movie.

Disturbing? Yes. Boring? With an ATM that instructs customers to ""Insert cat now"" and a severed head chilling in the fridge, there is nothing boring about the film.

The man is adrift with no real meaning in his life, and thus this is why he is ""psycho"".

He demeans women, seeing them as little more than sex objects or status symbols. He is engaged to a woman (played by Reese Witherspoon) who sees men in the same way he sees women, which is convenient for a while but eventually results in a rupture of the relationship.

He is hyper competitive and overly sensitive to the trappings of success. He becomes especially competitive with a colleague Paul Allen (played by Jared Leto) who has gained recognition that Patrick lacks and seeks.

Early in the film Patrick lapses into psychotic halucinatory behavior, thinking that he is killing the women he picks up and the collegues who out shine him at work. We are given considerable hints throughout the film that his murders are figments of his imagination. I realize that some viewers will not interpret the film in this manner at all, but I suggest they carefully watch the film and seek the clues that Patrick is hallucinating and thus imaging that his desire to kill is in fact overt behaviors rather than impulsive thoughts.

So why is he an American Psycho? Because he is a terrible empty shell of a person, driven to self definition by the American marketplace. The poor fellow had no original opinions. He actually memorizes CD covers as substitutes for developing an original opinion of the pop music that is integrated throughout the film.

And yet, in some ways this really is a horror film, for what could be more horrible that a meaningless existance? The author of the book, Bret Easton Ellis, would let us know that many people experience this horror every day.

The film is actually very good and unfortunately misunderstood and underestimated by most viewers.",1168214400,25,2181,4.833780160857909
70226,5,0783243499,Ahhhh....Christian Bale.  Need I say more.  I had heard about this movie but never saw it until last year.  I was very impressed.  Definitely a black comedy about a serial killer jumping into total madness.  Or is he??  Definitely a classic to keep.  Love the use of humor in killing with the 80's music.  Such a decadent decade.,1167868800,2,329,4.551724137931035
70237,3,0783243499,"Relatively speaking, that is.

This is an interesting, if a bit over the top, portrait of a psychopath gone bananas.  Presented in white, white, and more white so that the red, red, red of the blood will be all the more contrasting, this approach coincides with the ultra, ultra sophistication of the Harvard and Yale grads working on Wall Street who are so, so very venal and superficial.  This is a slasher film that will appeal equally to heartlanders on a date night, and to those blue coasters who need a little titillation.

[And then suddenly Bateman takes over my review]:

Yeah, RIGHT.  Who cares.

Personally, I don't usually watch slasher films, being above that kind of stuff, but this is stylishly done--and I do like style in my blood splattering.  Where director Mary Herron screws up is in not realizing that only an idiot sociopath would be so stupid and self-destructive as to so carelessly kill so many people.  If there is one thing a sociopath never wants to do is to bring pain upon himself.  Don't you think, considering the ending, that Bateman is going to be caught?  Huh?

[Resuming control of my review and droning on]:

...although the terms ""sociopath"" and ""psychopath"" are often used interchangeably, there is a clear tendency for ""psychopath"" to be reserved for violent sociopaths.  Another reason ""psychopath"" is correct is because this is a postmodern update of the classic Hitchcock slasher movie Psycho (1960) starring...

[Again taking over]:

Shut up. Who cares who it starred?  The point here is that this film--we're talking about MY film-- is a TOTALLY INACCURATE portrait of a true psycho--I mean sociopath.  We don't make ourselves so vulnerable to the Criminal Justice System.  We are NOT intent on self-destruction.  Believe me if I ever decide to get my jollies by slashing someone up, I will make absolutely sure I can get away with it.  Only low IQ psychos like Scott Peterson get caught.  And, by the way, what is with this chainsaw business?  I mean he tosses it down the stairwell so that it crashes on the floor from how many stories above, and it still works so he can use it on ""Christie""?  Give me a break.

Oh.  You think that it hit her while still running, huh?  Ha, ha, ha!  Nice shot, dude.

[Again resuming control]:

..notice too that the ending allows for a sequel, yet has all the trappings of an ending.  We know that he is going to be caught and yet...

[Coming back out of the screen...]:

We know nothing.  The cops are stupid.  Nobody will believe...

[Shoving him back in...]:

...the emphasis on the conspicuous consumption of expensive food and wine, drugs, cigars, the indulgence of any kind of animal pleasure is, on one level a statement about our society--well, Wall Street society--but on another level is part of the usual Hollywood seduction of the audience.  This is the fast lane.  Wouldn't you like to live in the fast lane for a bit, but of course come back (after they run the credits) to your own way of life?  Isn't this the essence of escape?  Go to the movies, rent a DVD, kick up your feet and escape for awhile, and maybe there will be a catharsis, as the Greek tragedians intended.  And when you turn off the set and go to bed you realize that nothing in your life is so extreme and nothing in your life is really that far gone, and yet you have experienced vicariously an extreme emotion, and as a bonus you can feel superior to those Ivy League sickos.

In truth this is a slightly tongue in cheek slasher/serial killer flick.  It's a satire of sorts.  It is as slick as slick can be, thoroughly engrossing with fine acting from especially Christian Bale who plays Bateman.  The direction is as tight as a well-strung banjo, the script nearly hypnotic in its seductive power, the New York ultra hip sets eye-widening as seeing the Taj Mahal while the sidebar-like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny.  Best joke: they're in the restroom of a fancy eating establishment and doing some lines and the guy in the next stall gets a little uptight because they're loud and screams out, ""Will you keep it down. I'm trying to do drugs!""

Also funny is how Bateman says what he really thinks and nobody takes him seriously, and how he slips up from time to time and nobody notices.

Incidentally, Reese Witherspoon has a minor part as exactly the kind of clueless woman who might very well marry a psychopath.  I liked this touch because I have known a few non-violent sociopaths and I often wondered if their spouses had a clue.  Clearly Reese's character did not.

Also excellent in support was Chloe Sevigny as Jean, Bateman's adoring (but also clueless) secretary.  The idea here is that women are so bowled over by Bateman's alpha male credentials that they can't see the real person.  The only character to really realize who Bateman was (and she ended up listening to that knowledge a little late) was the streetwalker.  Well, Jean gets the picture finally as she peruses Bateman's graphic notebook.  (By the way, somebody got paid to draw all the stuff in it.  I wonder who that was.  Was there a mention in the credits, something like, sick psycho doodlings by...?)

Finally: real life irony.  The character that Bale played in a movie immediately before this one was Jesus of Nazareth in a TV drama called Mary, Mother of Jesus (1999).  As Casey Stengel used to say, you could look it up.",1166832000,4,5426,4.666314677930306
70238,5,0783243499,"...but there's so much more to love. Even if this movie wasn't a spot-on dissection of Reagen-era attitudes and excesses (not that things are that different today), Christian Bale's AMAZING performance would make it worthwhile. I admit I wasn't too into it at first, thinking from reviews and commercials that it would be ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" in Armani...after a few more viewings, it really started to sink in. I now watch it at least twice a month. Seriously.

Trying to put this into the genre of horror and compare it to films within those confines misses the point entirely...most of the violence takes place off screen and it's actually incidental to the overall point or ""message"". If I had to put it next to another movie for comparison, my choice would be ""Taxi Driver"". It portrays the same inner turmoil and desire to belong, but in a much more cold and cynical way. Whereas Travis Bickle (DeNiro) had an almost innocent, Holden Caulfield-esque outlook on life and the drive to be a heroic figure that saves the world, Patrick Bateman sees the world as an extension of his ""greed and disgust"". There's also the fact that I've seen each a zillion times and still occasionally pick up a detail or line of dialogue that I'd never noticed before.

Anyway, it's a mind-blowingly good movie IN MY OPINION with beautiful cinematography and great performances from everyone involved (Willem Dafoe's scenes are sparse but hilarious and Chloe Sevigny's character gives a quiet, poignant feel to her major scene with Bale.)

Heck, not even the soundtrack redeemed it, and I love 80s pop.  The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die.

I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end you just can't care. Live? Die? Whatever - just get to the bloody point already.

 From the casting, sets, mood, cinematography, lighting, acting, everything is superb.

 This is the film that propelled Christian Bale's career and you can see why. Handsome with an immaculate body yet pulsing with menace. He manages to project the subdued brutality necessary for the part while relying on very few tricks. The way Bale as the lead deceives everyone around him with his soulless conversation is creepy beyond words, especially since you're in on the 'gag'. When the character finally pops, the film gives the violence its due. Holding back would have hurt the film and the director wisely chooses for the full bore approach.

 The mark of a great film to me is one that seems to breathe with its own life. Where you have no doubt in your mind that this world exists somewhere and you believe you could step into it.

But, I feel they did a good job of capturing the sardonic wit and social commentary from the book, and putting it on celluloid. I just think those ideas should have been played up a little more, more in an effort to set the ideas and ideals of the 1980's and the main character, Patrick Bateman, who is a walking stereotype of everything the Reagan-era was felt to represent against the sick and twisted very non-stereotypical actions he performed.

Sadly, I think this movie didn't fare as well as it could have in the theatres because they advertised it to be ""horror"", when it was meant to be ""horrific"". But aside from that, this movie is a nice evenings diversion, but, since the social commentary it communicates gets muddled at times, it won't change any lives.

70245,4,0783243499,"""An American Psycho"" is one of those films that people seem to find very difficult to come to grips with. Is it a masterpiece deserving of praise? Is it a completely boring, insensitive piece of sick trash? Or is it something in between? Through all this argument though, there is one thing that cannot be denied. That this film will provoke a reaction from the viewer whether it is feelings of disgust, praise, amusement, unease or all of the above. Well, unless of course the viewer is in a similar state of mind as Patrick Bateman that is.

You see, Patrick Bateman externally appears to be everything a man could want to be. He has a body to die for, a big earning job and all the worldly possessions that come with the territory. Yet despite all this, Patrick finds it difficult to feel anything. He states in the film that he feels no human emotions other than ""greed and disgust"" and it's this complete lack of connection with the world that drives him to violence. However, even these extreme outbursts of gruesome bloodshed still can't make him feel anything but empty and only distance him further from humanity, driving him towards madness.

Christian Bale's performance as Patrick is simply stunning. He fills the character with humour, anger, charm, intelligence and copious amounts of vanity. Christian makes even the strangest of scenarios in Patrick's existence appear to be completely realistic for him. An example of such bizarre behaviour is the way he verbally critiques Huey Lewis and the News while murdering a colleague. Or when he decides another colleague should die for the simple fact that they now have a better business card than he does. These occurrences are as funny as they are unsettling but never unintentionally so. The direction is perfectly understated and considering the extreme nature of the book it is based on, the screenplay is as loyal as decency (amongst the general movie going population anyway) and budget would allow. I should point out though that I have not yet read the book and this review is based only on the movie itself and not the quality of the adaptation.

""An American Psycho"" is not for the faint of heart and yet there essentially isn't all that much on-screen gore. Not to say that killing people with chainsaws and axes isn't gory, only that these brutal acts of slaughter are mostly either only suggested or just out of the cameras view. But more than the acts themselves, many viewers will find the nonchalant, motiveless way in which Patrick conducts them far more disturbing, not to mention his degrading use of women as self gratifying objects.

I thoroughly enjoy this movie. Despite all the disconcerting aspects of the story it remains an entertaining film and multiple viewings have definitely been rewarding. The only way in which I feel this film is not a complete success is in the ambiguousness of its final moments. Although it certainly makes a great discussion point post viewing, I can't help but feel it to be frustrating and slightly unnecessary. I have my views on what it all means, but I won't mention them here as I don't want to ruin things for those that haven't seen the movie yet.

70257,4,0783243499,"In this film version of Brett Easton Ellis' often misunderstood satiric novel, the question of Bateman's real versus imaginary deeds is answered more firmly than Ellis allowed to happen in the book. Here, seemingly, at least some if not all of Patrick Bateman's violence apparently came to pass only in the space between the sick (though impeccably fashionable) Yuppie's ears. In this flashy, stylish and yet somehow still laudably low-key adaptation of a novel once thought unfilmable, Christian Bale does  a superb job of embodying a self-loving, celebrity-obsessed, brand name worshipping billionaire playboy, who tells us in lingering detail how he just happens to slay random people in his spare time. Bale trades his native Welsh accent for a polished snooty high society American one, and his comedic narcissism is refreshing in comparison with how so many other actors would have played this daunting role. The extended ""cut"" of American Psycho restores some of the nudity and a little of the violence left out in the theatrical release six years ago. What has never been removed is the dark humor and blistering satire that skewers the late 1980's love of excess. Fine performances abound in American Psycho, from the always magnificent Willem Dafoe, to Reese Witherspoon as Patrick's bubble-brained fiance, to a downtrodden Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's loyal secretary, to Samantha Mathis as a pill popping ""hotbod"" whose dead-end drug addiction amuses the sadistic Bateman. Filmmaker Mary Harron, who also gave us the bleak nineties art-flick, I Shot Andy Warhol, packs a lot into the relatively short run time of this movie, and in my opinion, she did a pretty fine job with some difficult material.",1157587200,6,1709,5.192028985507246

Christian Bale pulls off the character of Patrick Bateman impeccably. He is completely empty and devoid of emotion, though trying to... fit... in...

The scene where Bateman confesses all his crimes over the phone is where you truly get to see the brilliance of Christian Bale and why he's risen to the star status he has today.

For this movie to be a low-budget film is even more amazing, and shows that it's not money that makes a movie great, but acting, directing, and a good script.

There's black comedy, satire and gore in equal proportions. The way violence is shown to - or kept from - the viewer reminded me of ""Reservoir Dogs"" in the way that the camera slightly deviates from the target forcing us to imagine exactly what's happening right there. Andrezj Sekula cinematography struck me as particularly good as it perfectly resembles that 80s look and feel in a picture that's been released in 2000.

And then there's a brilliant performance by Christian Bale, one of the best serial killer impersonations I've ever seen and Bale's best acting ever if it wasn't for stuff like ""The Machinist"" which would come later in his career. What's really difficult about doing a serial killer role is not exactly the killings but rather, and very much so in this case, the downward spiral of their mind. Bateman is a victim of the mid to late 80s lust in America, Wall Street in particular, like all of his colleagues. He's just gone a little bit overboard (this is obviously an understatement but you get my point). His insanity is in fact a by product of his lifestyle. There's this scene where Bateman, in a state of complete despair, admits all his crimes to his lawyer over the phone which is utterly brilliant and Bale nails it.

The final stages of the film are kind of open, lending themselves to different interpretations and personally I prefer having to rethink the whole film under a different light after I've seen it.",1154649600,4,1677,4.658783783783784
70261,5,0783243499,"Morals by the wayside with a grandiose explosion of debauchery and mayhem can only describe the film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' shocking novel ""American Psycho"". Christian Bale plays the title role of troubled stockbroker Patrick Bateman, who has worked his way to the top of his stock brokerage with little more than his wealthy father's influence. He lives a predictable life: eating at the hotspots, going to the new clubs, dating beautiful women, and paying $15 for vodka tonics on a regular basis.

From the outset of the film we can tell that Patrick's habits are obsessive (to say the least) and his taste in entertainment is bordering on sadistic. After he loses complete interest in work, he begins to manifest elements of the horror movies he watches constantly into his everyday life: he goes on a murder spree. It starts rather benignly, then gets sickeningly more gruesome as the movie progresses. We see him drift slowly into an oblivion of insanity, at which point the viewer begins to question what is real and what is imagined.

Christian Bale's tour de force as Ellis' hated character

Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is perhaps one of the best dramatic roles to come from any actor in recent years. His simulation of insanity is easily believable by the viewer: he is a normal, everyday guy that we can identify with. This is what makes it especially shocking to the viewer: society has put Patrick in a box where he can do nothing but succeed, and yet he inexplicably decides to pursue a life as a deranged serial killer almost just to see if he can do it. The label put on him is so effective that when he confesses all his crimes to his lawyer in a moment of clarity, his lawyer doesn't even believe him. His journey begins testing the waters of murder, but ultimately he ends up swimming in an ocean of blood.

A controversial ending reminiscent of the book is what truly made this movie for me, but even true fans of Ellis' work are split on if its presence was effective. The aforementioned phone call to his lawyer leads even Patrick to speculate if his insanity has caused him to imagine all of the crimes he has committed, or if they are indeed real. With the amount of live action and murder on screen in the movie, it is plainly obvious that he did not imagine any of this at all. As for the character being insane: there's no question of that. He is as crazy as they come, and Bale makes us believe it.",1153958400,2,2445,4.575342465753424
70262,5,0783243499,"I originally wrote the following review in regard to the book, but it is as relevant to the movie, which is less complex but still enjoyable, as it is to the book:

I've read various Amazon readers' American Psycho reviews over the past couple years and find that most of them either loved or hated the book. Most of them get that the author is using satire and most of them can describe for you a nice summary, including the crux of the work: are those murders real or imagined; that is, is Bateman really a psychotic killer, or is he a harmless loser who takes out his angst against those around him in fantasy? Unless the author one day announces which side Patrick Bateman really falls on, there is plenty of evidence in the book to justify anyone finding reason to believe he indeed was a murderer or a dreamer. All this can be deduced by any reader.

What sets apart, I think, those readers who enjoy the read versus they who loathe it (aside, of course, from they who are simply offended by the graphic violence) is the (lack of) appreciation of point of view. I've heard and read many times that people find the book too distracted by or devoted to abstract and meaningless descriptions of periphery items or situations and by way of monotony. I argue that is the essential element that makes this book work, makes it real. If the objective of any author writing this book were to be simply submit a biographical piece, then he would do what many critics say and supplied just enough arbitrarily descriptive monotony to make the point clear that Bateman is void of real human emotion and moved on with the plot from there. That's not the objective though. The entire point of this book is that you are reading the thoughts, you are inside the mind of a psychotic individual. It is written as a psycopath would write it.

Personally, I am not that bothered by the graphic violence, but I don't care for it either. I think that is all noise. The cream of this book is in the trueness of the point of view (Bateman's narrative, that of a psychopath) Ellis maintains through this endless and seemingly meaningless monotonous descriptions of people, music, products, and paisley ties coupled with Bateman's equal parts insecurity --masked by vanity-- and disgust for his peers, superiors, and inferiors.",1153353600,3,2306,4.6332518337408315

70266,5,0783243499,"I first saw American Psycho in a multiplex in, of all places, Plymouth. I was looking forward to a cool, brilliant, classy, savage satire on yuppiedom, but I think most of the rest of the audience were hoping for a slasher movie. The action was punctuated with cries of ""Kill 'er!"" and ""Stab the slag!"" Ah, Navy towns.

Oliver Stone nearly directed this movie, and we should be glad he didn't, when you consider what a daft mess he made of Quentin Tarantino's unpretentiously nasty original script for Natural Born Killers. He also wanted to cast Leonard DiCaprio, who at the time was one of the biggest stars in the world. How fashions change, eh? Fortunately, it reverted to Mary Harron (who'd proved herself on I Shot Andy Warhol) and she got to have her first choice in the lead, Christian Bale. Bale's performance is one of the most rip-roaring in Nineties cinema; he's like the concentrated essence of yuppie, sun-dried (or is it freeze-dried?) yuppie. That he had to remake his body and create the accent from the ground up suits the character perfectly. Patrick Bateman is, as he says himself, all mask - there is nobody there. The smirking, male-model relish with which Bale delivers lines like ""The Mud Soup with Charcoal Arugula is outrageous!"" is a sight to behold. It's surely intentional that he and his pals (chiefly Josh Lucas and Justin Theroux, respectively excellent in Wonderland and Mulholland Dr.) look like nothing so much as a bunch of guys in a Hugo Boss ad, as they sit around and make offensive remarks about women and Jews. (""Hey,"" says Patrick with sweet reasonableness, ""cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks, okay?"")

The screenwriters, Harron herself and Guinevere Turner (who, weirdly, had previously co-written and starred in the sweet lesbian love story Go Fish), manage to drag the satirical essence of Ellis' novel onto the screen. It's a book like ""Naked Lunch"", in that nobody would let you film it exactly the way it's written. Probably only women could be so funny about how insane men can get. The actual butchery is more hinted at than shown; Bateman meets a model in a club, the next day he's twirling a lock of her hair in his fist, and that evening we notice in passing that her severed head is in his freezer. There's the notorious moment with the twirling chainsaw, and there's the hilarious and appalling Huey Lewis/axe attack moment, but there's not much else to make you lose your dinner. My only regret is that the final shot, with the ""This Is Not An Exit"" sign discreetly placed behind Bale's head, is all but lost on the small screen.

It can also be argued that Bateman's crackup, when he hysterically confesses all his killings over the phone to his lawyer, somewhat draws the teeth of the rest of the movie, in that nobody appears to notice what he's done. The viewer is all but forced to the conclusion that it was all in his head. Bale is brilliant in the scene, even strangely touching, but as a piece of writing (and a moment of utter faithfulness to the book) you can't help wondering whether these people want to make some good satire or just...yawn...play around with, like, textuality. Still, it's one of the best movies about the 80s, and knocks something like ""Wall Street"" out of the water. What are Harron and Turner and Bale doing now? Anyone know?",1151107200,4,3319,4.709122203098107

Often catagorized as horror, this is nothing of the sort. It's neither comedy or horror, but a brilliant satire of the yuppies in the 80's. It's funny, horrific, and disturbing. That's an accomplishment on its own.

Bale(Bateman) has an amazing performance in his role. His acting adds to every scene in the film that he's in. The supporting cast is also very good. There's not one person in the entire film that had a bad scene.

In the end he goes on a killing spree that is more hilarious and over the top than shocking and horrifying like this movie wants you to think it is.

I think this movie could have been made much, much better- the killing scenes could have been more violent- the sexual scene in there I thought was totally unnecessary, the girls weren't even pretty. Although I do have to say the sex scene does get the point across how sadistic and disgusting Bale's character really is- and that is what basically is the only good thing about this movie- Christian's character and the way he plays it.

70282,5,0783243499,"Anyone with a degree of wit will enjoy this film, though may question themselves for doing so, considering the dark content.

If you've read the novel, this is very much a lightened version, with gore exchanged for biting black humour, with most of the original hilarious Bateman quotes kept in.

The film centres around Patrick Bateman, a well-educated, self-obsessed 'yuppie' living in 1980s New York. Shallow Bateman feels little empathy with his fellow man, and even less for his fellow woman.

Bateman is engaged to the lovely Evelyn(Reese Witherspoon) but is too busy listening to Robert Palmer on his walkman,drawing a corpse in crayon on a tablecloth in a very exclusive restaurant or ""returning video tapes"" to pay much attention to her. Their relationship typifies the 80s culture, summed up by Evelyn's ""my friends are your friends"" justification for their love-less association. Both are having affairs with each other's drug-addicted best friends.

Bateman's only friends(or associates) are his generic entourage of Wall Street colleagues, all sporting identical armani suits, versace sunglasses, crisp business cards, hairstyles and outlooks. Bateman, brilliantly captured in all his perfect clinical detail by Christian Bale, spends his days honing his physique with a mind-numbing exercise itinerary and facial-cleansing routine then 'trying to fit in' at his Father's accountancy firm Pearce & Pearce while scribbling pictures of the unfortunates he mutiliated the night before.

At times the film becomes almost too surreal(FEED ME A STRAY CAT screams the hole in the wall machine), with the viewer never quite sure if Bateman really did murder a string of hookers, vagrants and various other victims or simply imagined the whole thing- his liberal use of cocaine, halcium and any other substance he can lay his hands on suggests the latter. Bateman and friends spend much of the film enjoying Cocaine-fuelled dry whiskey benders while being mistaken for other identikit businessmen and paying lip-service to world issues in Sri Lanka, the nuclear arms race and Apartheid.

Bateman's geeky love of 80s music characterised by his emotional critique of Genesis, Huey Lewis and Whitney Houston is very very funny, and I don't mind admitting despite his murderous leanings, I really enjoyed the character, and don't be suprised if you find yourself nodding along to some of his insanely bitter rants or laughing at his egotism and withering put-downs.

Make your own mind up whether Bateman's a murderer or just a fantasist, but be sure to see this film, and if you enjoy it, add the book to your haul too.

Cast:  Christian Bale, Justin Theroux, John Lucas, Bill Sage, Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis, Matt Ross, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe.

Running Time:  101 minutes

Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, drug use and language.

""American Psycho"" is a disturbing movie filled with the brutal murders and executions of various people (mostly of the female persuasion). What's really scary is that through much of the movie, our funny bone is being tickled. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, in a star-making turn) is a shallow Wall Street banker who lives an empty life. He lives and dies by a soda pop advertising slogan: Image Is Everything.  Set in the late 1980s, he is of a time when style reigns supreme over substance, obsessed with his physical beauty, getting into the trendiest restaurants, and nitpicking with his coworkers about who has the best business cards. Said co-workers (Jared Leto, Matt Ross, Justin Theroux, and Josh Lucas), all have the same haircut and business suits, and for all intents and purposes are interchangeable. Bateman's sex life isn't exactly lacking, by any means. He's engaged to the shallow Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), but cheats on her with her best friend Courtney (Samantha Mathis). He picks up a hooker off the street (Cara Seymour) and gets her in a threesome with another one of his friends, Elizabeth (Guinevere Turner, who co wrote the script).  His secretary Jean (Chloe Sevigny) also secretly lusts after him. Little does she know that he seems to have knocked off his best friend Paul Allen (Leto), a nameless homeless man, and countless members of the fairer sex, all by increasingly imaginative killing methods (staple gun, chainsaw, ATM machine; he tries it all). Eventually he finds he's being trailed by detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe), who's investing Allen's disappearance but also seems to know a bit more about Patrick than he should.  From this moment on Bateman's inner demons are unleashed as he descends into an unending frenzy of paranoia and murder.

Directed by Mary Harron (""I Shot Andy Warhol"", ""The Notorious Betty Page"") made a clever social satire film mixed brilliantly with horror. This film is loaded with dark humor, while Bale gives a dynamic performance. This independent film has high production values, a fine music score by John Cale and good looking cinematography by Andrzej Sekula (""Pulp Fiction"").  The film adaptation shows the depths of the novel refraining from its cruelty. Even though it boasts some shocking scenes (i.e. the chainsaw) the nature of the impact is mainly psychological and relies very much on the impressive performance by Christian Bale, once again proving the wonderful actor he is. Rather than being dark and ambiguous with respect to the main character, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have chosen to look at him from outside thus exposing his pantheism and twisted sense of reality, therefore avoiding any chance of glamorization of the character, and the film is constantly mocking his yuppie macho conceit, something the novel left the reader to do him/herself. Also, it deserves to be noted that the film is much more woman-friendly than the novel could possibly ever be, most female characters (including the melancholy Courtney) being sympathetic. There is no scope for misogyny here.  American Psycho"" is a movie that pushes the limits of the audience's ability to cope for a number of reasons. A film told from the point of view of a psychotic is harsh enough, but the film also beckons the audience to question their own sanity. You're forced to look at your own sensibilities and morals and put them to the test...can you condone Bateman's actions and thoughts? Do you agree with them? Sometimes you find yourself saying yes to these questions, and for this some people may call it a travesty. By the same token, it pushes the envelope, thus it could even be called a triumph.

70286,3,0783243499,"A cult-classic, American Psycho, is about a young, well-off young man, who loves himself almost as much as he loves killing.  Christian Bale (Batman Begins) plays a homicidal maniac so well that I seriously was stuck in the moment-by-moment details of this movie.  I stayed up all night just imagining the scene where blood splattered against his face as he killed one of his victims.  This movie really shows the sickness that can be under a seemingly ""normal person.""  Wealth means nothing, beauty means nothing....your co-worker could be a murderer.",1132185600,2,552,5.1
70287,1,0783243499,"I recently watched this movie and must say I was terribly disappointed.  Christian Bale did a good job, but he was failed by the script and the direction.  I can't compare it to the book, because I have not read the book.  If it was attempting satire it misfired.  This was essentially a cross between the classic ""Psycho"" and a David Mamet play.  The voice-over narration was intrusive, an almost ""Wonder Years"" gone dark.  If it was attempting to discourse about the boundaries of sanity and insanity, this was already better handled In Roman Polanski's movie ""Repulsion,"" with Catherine Deneuve.  The idea that preppies of the eighties were a shallow lot, and that some people in power may not be altogether sane is not exactly a news flash.  In fact, the latter can be found in ""Das Kabinett Des Doktor Caligari.""

Worst of all the movie was just plain boring.  Hollow with cold surfaces.",1131926400,6,892,4.733766233766234
70288,5,0783243499,"Based on Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel American Psycho, this film tells the story of an 80's yuppie named Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) who works on Wall Street by day and kills people by night. Like the often misunderstood novel, the film is more of a dark social comedy than a real horror story. Bateman dresses and talks like all the other wealthy, young Wall Street crowd, and thus mistaken identity plays a big part in his getting away with gruesome murders again and again. Bateman's own grip on reality begins to blur over time and at various times throughout the movie it's quite obvious that Patrick's view of reality is a sick, homicidal dream of endless torture and killing. Even when Bateman confesses at one point, no one listens or seems to care. Everyone has their own agenda and the main concern of Bateman's friends is which extravagant restaurant to dine at next, or getting the latest and greatest business card to impress one another.

Casting Christian Bale was a brilliant choice by director Mary Harron, who almost got fired from the project because of not choosing Leonardo DiCaprio for the starring role. I honestly don't think anyone could've captured Patrick Bateman's personality more flawlessly than Bale, who gave an extraordinary, chilling performance. And casting Reese Witherspoon as the prissy, bubble-brained Evelyn, who's engaged to Bateman but knows nothing of his psychotic, homicidal behavior, was a perfect choice. Much of the dialogue in the film is taken directly from Ellis' book, and the horrific violence of the book was toned down considerably, with much of it taking place off camera. Many viewers don't seem to appreciate the frequent humor in American Psycho, such as the various times Bateman says crazy things like, ""I'm into murders and executions"" that no one seems to hear. And his philosophical ramblings about the music of Huey Lewis & the News, Phil Collins, and Whitney Huston are hysterical!

The new ""Killer Collector's Edition"" is a mixed bag as far as worthwhile special features go. The documentary ""From Book to Screen"" is in depth but instead of having new interviews with the stars there are mostly boring interviews with film critics. Plus, it seemed like there was way too much coverage of the novel and very little on the actual shooting of the film. There's a lame video essay read by some singer and a documentary on the `80s. Thankfully, there are several deleted scenes (with optional director's commentary) as well as several humorous trailers. My favorite special feature (and probably the main reason why you should by this edition) is the director's commentary which tells lots of entertaining behind the scenes info. And, the picture and sound quality are better than ever! American Psycho IS NOT a film for everyone, but for those who enjoy intelligent satires with a little horror mixed in, this modern classic is a definite must for your DVD collection! And before you judge or even watch this movie, you should read Ellis' novel to appreciate the whole, uncensored story.

70289,5,0783243499,"Directed by Mary Harron and based on Bret Easton Ellis' novel, American Psycho is an excellent cinematic approach to various issues that have sparked constant controversy.  While not as graphic as the novel these controversial topics still shine through.  Racism, misogyny, gratuitous sexuality and violence are just a few of the obstacles a viewer will meet headfirst when seeing this movie.

 From Patrick Bateman's first soliloquy to his last, you get the sense that you're not watching your typical serial killer movie.  American Psycho places you right into the mind and daily routines of its villain.  What makes the above issues even worse per se, is that the main character has no feelings about what he does.  He commits the most horrendous acts with as much ease or emotion as one might use when brushing their teeth.

 The role of Bateman is played by Christian Bale.  He fully grasps and embraces his character turning it into a precise art.  He makes the movie worth watching solely on his performance.  He gives the role a dark but goofy edge, which may even cause you to laugh at some of his more vicious acts.

 An interesting factor about Patrick Bateman is the fact that you would never suspect him of being a serial killer.  He's a millionaire, he has a perfect body, and he can get any girl he wants.  He seemingly has the perfect life one might think.  No one would ever guess what really goes through his mind.

 One of the best things this movie does as a whole is the fact that it turns a very controversial book into a very satisfying and enjoyable film.",1131321600,7,1579,4.655797101449275
70290,5,0783243499,"I saw this film back when it first came out and I wasn't just amazed with this film, I was amazed with Christian Bale. Good thing they didn't get Leonardo Dicaprio to play Bateman. As much as a good actor Dicaprio is, he doesn't fit into Bateman's shoes.

This movie isn't as gory as the book, but the performances by everyone in this film makes this film a killer. Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a New York City yuppy who has money, hangs out with his friends at clubs and dinner, has a sweet girlfriend {Witherspoon}, and has a nice apt. But, there's something about him his friends don't know, he's a murderer.

But, things don't go too well after he kills Paul Allen {Leto}, a detective Kimble {Dafoe} is now questioning him on Allen's disappearance.

This uncut version doesn't have extra gore, just a longer scene of him having sex with 2 lovely ladies. This DVD does have cool features, but I wish a new interview with Christian Bale was on it. I guess he was too busy filming Batman Begins.

70292,5,0783243499,"If you own or saw tha original American Psycho, and liked it at all, immediately click Buy. The movie itself is a four star masterpiece, and we get a bevy of special features and an extended cut.

Mary Harron directs and co-writes with Guinevere Turner, who writes and appears as Elizabeth in the movie. They adapted the screenplay off of the book by Bret Easton Ellis. They use the backdrop of the Eighties and the Yuppster-wave to create a social satire, surreal black comedy, and suspense horror all rolled into one fantastic movie.

 Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a yuppie who has all the right clothes, all the right friends (Bill Sage, Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux), a gorgeus fiancee (Reese Witherspoon as Evelyn), he's cheating on her with her best friend (Sam Mathis as Courtney), and is rising to the height of wallstreet celebrity. There's just one problem.... He has a lust to kill. Everyone.
The killer inside is someone he hides behind this mask of success and humanity. But he struggles to even be human. He longs for sex or violence, sometimes both. But when things start to get out of hand, he begins to lose his sanity, blending his perception of the monster within with the reality around him.

Christian's performance is amazing, as we find out in the commentary that not only did he have an amazing and rigorous excercise regimen to get an amazing physique, but in some scenes when he is dealing with inspector Kimball (Dafoe) he actually sweats on cue. Anyone who has seen him in Batman Begins, The Machinist, Equilibrium, or Velvet Goldmine will know he is a modern master, always putting himself through intense preparations for his roles. The rest of the actors are great too, with their 80's parody and preppy accents. The only thing I thought needed more screen time was Willem Dafoe. He had plenty of time in the book, and he gets top billing, but he is hardly used in the movie.

The movie does a really good job of an ambiguous ending and keeping the line between what Bateman is imagining, and whats actually happening. The scene where he is going on his rampage with the chainsaw, and the one with the gun, are so violent and over the top, that were not even sure why things are happening or if they even are. In the ending, were left with a sense that in a world where everyone strives to be the same, Bateman can't even be recognized as himself, even when he's trying to get caught. A scary and disturbed theme, that applies to more than the fictional world of Psycho, but seems as though it could have been a true story of the 80's and maybe even today.

This is the 'uncut killer edition' so we're treated to some great specials features, in fact more (in a sense, more on that in a minute) than I've seen. The other editions had only a short making-of and a interview with Christian Bale. However, this edition gets 2 commentary tracks, Six deleted scenes, 3 making-of featurettes and behind-the-scenes/interviews. Also, and odd addition of an essay written by Holly Willis and read by singer Sarah Elquist.

The first commentary features director/co-writer Mary Harron. She talks about the idea behind translating the book to screen, some of the happy accidents during shooting, the actors, etc. It's a good commentary that not only gives you info on the movie, and the controversary surrounding the book and movie. She follows the movie well and doesn't stop more than a couple times. The second track features Guinevere Turner, cowriter. She does not do such a good track speaking about her inspirations and what they changed and took out in reference to the book. But she really just watches the movie, and kinda complains.

The 'Postcards from the 80's' featurettes are sort of a making-of crossed with the VH1 formula: A whole lot of critics and producers/crew and random celebrities talking about the three parts of getting the movie made; 'The Book', 'The Deal', 'The Film'. They also go quite in depth in these three bits about the controversy of the book, and later how that affected the movie. Also, there's another called, 'The 80's: Downtown'. It's a look at the nostalgia elements used in the film. Same idea as the others, random people including people involved in the movie.  Lastly, is 'The Violence of Pornography' essay. It looks at it's own social commentary from both sides. Something the films doesn't touch and not a lot of movies who would tell you the critique of it's content.

Overall this disc is a great special release, and even if you already own the original, get this one. A great addition to horror fans or yuppie haters collections.",1129939200,5,4611,4.731008717310087
70293,5,0783243499,"After watching this movie a few times, several interpretations occurred to me.

1. All the killings are fantasies.  Evidence: The ""feed-stray-cat"" message on the ATM.  Also, the ending in which Bateman's lawyer says that he had just met the missing Paul Allen in London after the latter's supposed murder.

2. There was a lofty conspiracy designed to protect Bateman.  This would then make the film very political with Bateman representing unregulated, ruthless corporations and his lack of accountability representing the machinations of society which cover up the destruction and enable it.  The evidence: the ending of the film in which Reagan delivers his Iran-Contra apologia speech points the film in a markedly political direction.  The depiction of yuppie rich materialistic life implicates a larger culture of unchecked consumption: corporations and their penchant for destruction.

Either way, this film is a study of narcissism and moral vacuity (and perhaps something more), with Christian Bale giving a remarkable, hilarious performance.",1129680000,4,1050,5.60126582278481
70294,5,0783243499,"There has been a great debate over this movie's being classified as horror or comedy.  It is grusome, horrible and gory, but at the same time oddly cute at times.  It portrays a period in time and a certain mentality, but at the same time transcends to present day.

Patrick Bateman is the yuppie scum we grew to hate: arrogant, materialistic, and self serving.  Yet, at the same time while being psychotic, he longs for substance.  He seeks it out in friends, job and social life, and finds nothing.  Instead he becomes obsessed with the most trivial of insignifigant things (ex. designer clothes), going so far as to obsess over the subtle watermarks on a business card.  His friends and aquaintance are so shallow they confuse him with someone else and he's happy to play into it.  Why shouldn't he?  No one knows the difference or takes the time out to realize it.  Maybe this is more a comment on our culture despite the yuppie / 80s backdrop.  People really are not all that concerned with more than themselves.  Perhaps none of us have true friends, it's all an illusion.  I believe that, I believe a lot of that to be true.

One of the oddest things I found about this movie was Patrick's relationship with his girlfriend.  While she is just as shallow and rude as the others, she has an odd hold over him that no one else seems to.  He doesn't exactly follow her orders, but she seems to have almost a mothering effect on him.  Patrick seems almost afraid of her, and when he finally ends the relationship he almost apologizes when he takes joy in hurting others.

Many people were angry about the sex scenes.  If anything they were just ridiculous (how about that scene of him flexing and posturing before the mirror with those two hookers while playing Phil Collins songs?!).  Want a real horror story, read the book.  It's disturbing, but then again that's the point of the movie.",1129680000,3,1892,4.571428571428571
70295,5,0783243499,"I remember when ""American Psycho"" came out on DVD.  I was in fourth grade, and not a huge fan of horror movies.  I instantly decided that I would never watch the film, because it looked like a stupid slasher flick.  Then, a few months ago, I saw Christian Bale in ""Batman Begins"" and thought he was fantastic.  I looked up ""American Psycho"" on the IMDb and it was rated pretty high.  So I thought, what the hey, I'll give it a try.

I'm mighty glad that I did.

""American Psycho"" is set in New York in 1987.  It revolves around Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), a very successful lawyer who may be getting married to Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon), is having an affair with Courtney (Samantha Mathis), and is the object of his secretary's (Chloe Sevigny) affections.  But unbeknownst to his so-called ""friends"" and co-workers, Patrick is a killer who strikes almost at random.  And now a clever detective (Willem Dafoe) is investigating the murder of one of Patrick's victims.  Will Patrick get caught?

The film is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' bestselling novel, which caused quite a controversy when it was first released.  ""American Psycho"" the film, like the book, is about two things: one, Patrick Bateman and the murders; and two, the self-absorbed society of the 80's.  Because it's set in the 80's, it has a great soundtrack, and it makes the movie much more fun.

Mary Harron's directing is wonderful.  During daytime scenes, the film seems bright and shiny, almost as though it were an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.  Then there's the nighttime scenes - dark, grim, with a texture like charcoal.  Harron enhances the film immensely.

Without a doubt, the highlight of the film is Christian Bale.  Bale's performance in this film is one of the greatest I have ever seen in my life.  He BECOMES the character.  It blew me away.  He can be mean, angry, suave, and damn funny.  The rest of the cast is good, but Bale is absolutely spectacular.

70315,4,0783243499,"I'm frustrated about giving this movie 4 stars and not 5 stars but because of the random and disgusting sex scenes, it got punched down to 4. Besides that, the movie is great. I was expecting a solid movie and it blew away my expectations. Oh, and by the way, I didn't see the unrated version but saw the original theatrical version. After watching the theatrical trailer, I thought that it would be very horrifying and disturbing. But, on the contrary, my friend! The movie is absolutely hilarious! The way that it is made makes it such that you'll laugh instead of being horrified. The gruesome deaths are made in a way that they're actually really funny. Here are some funn moments:

1. Patrick Bateman goes to get his sheets washed at a company but gets mad when they say that they can't get out the red stain on them. He claims that it's juice, cran apple. But, of course it isn't.

2. Patrick puts newspaper all around a place where a guy's sitting at his house. And then puts on a rain coat. I wonder why.

The movie is about Patrick Bateman, a rich Wall Street man who's obsessed with killing people. From bums to friends that he doesn't like to random women.

The movie isn't disturbing because the violence is made in such a comic matter that you laugh out loud, and then maybe feel guilty. But, boy, it's funny. The movie is very exciting and interesting and keeps you into it until its great ending. I loved the ending and found it to be very unpredictable but makes sense. And the comic violence made sense to me now. I recommend this awesome movie and Christian Bale's perfromance is stunning. No one else could have done. Call me crazy, but I would have given him an oscar. He deserved it.

And for parents nervous for their children that want to see it, I feel that 13 years + are good ages or mature children. The movie doesn't have a lot of cuss words but has some and the violence isn't really shown. You see the blood on Bateman's face and a body in the background but it's made comically. But, the random sex scenes are perverted so I recommend just closing your eyes. That's what I did.

This is a worthy rent and even a worthy buy. Too bad for the sex scenes, or else it definitely deserved 5 stars.",1122595200,,2222,4.381067961165049
70316,4,0783243499,"This movie is so damn cool, the acting by Bale is great top notch, he plays some up tight yuppie from wall street who is infatuated with his own self while going around killing people.

The 80's music is cool and just funny as hell for some reason , like when he shows the cover of phil collins album. This movie is full of laughs and great acting and directing, there are 3 or 4 murders like 1 or 2 in the beginig and then like 2 at the  very end, it would have been nice to throw one in the middle.

More violence would have got this 4 stars but since there wasn't it I will go with 3 1/2 stars. A cool movie glad I own and , yes I will watch plenty of time the acting and 80's music and the way the type of person Bale plays he does awesome, this is a movit  own but i do advise rent first cause I think its a movie that is wierd in its own way and not going to attract every one.

Others will see this as a silly movie, and won't understand why you want to see it over and over again. Its dark, its a little gory, but i laugh at every violent scene in the movie.",1122163200,,448,4.033707865168539
70327,4,0783243499,"I wasn't sure what to think the first time I saw this movie, having not then read the book it's based (albeit somewhat loosely) on. I actually found myself grinning and even laughing aloud while watching this movie, which made me feel sort of guilty...was I supposed to laugh when people were getting butchered gruesomely right and left? Was it really a vicious slasher flick? An 80s nostalgia flick? Or was it a social satire?

Actually, it is a bit of all three, though primarily it is a very well-done bit of social satire, commenting on the excesses of the late 1980s by examining one man, Patrick Bateman, played with total yuppie abandon by the remarkable Christian Bale. Bateman is a Wall Street high-flyer, completely lacking in importance but rich enough to give the appearance of it. He is a consummate performer, an empty shell of a man clad in expensive Valentino suits and cared for with the finest products pour l'homme. He blithely admits that he lacks any sort of human emotion except greed and ambition, and this becomes fairly obvious almost immediately; his face is usually fixed in an empty perma-grin, and his voice is rather high-pitched, with that hollow sort of forced cheerfulness that self-help gurus and promoters on late-night infomercials have.

This is entirely suitable for Bateman; he is the consummate consumer, far more interested in spending time with his daily personal care routine than in developing any real human relationships. He describes this skin-care and exercise regimen in a lengthy monologue, in fact, near the opening of the film. It is one of the film's most entertaining moments: its unabashed, preening vanity is hysterical, and the sequence is not hurt any by frequent displays of Bale's extremely well-cut physique. Bale uses his physicality as part of his roles, and always has: here he has the well-defined, bulked-up body of a Greek god and clearly spends most of his free time exercising to the point of obsession. This enhances the image of Bateman as a total narcissist, and plays along very well with the 80s obsession with exercise and weight.

When he is not discussing himself, Bateman talks mainly about music and pop culture. He delivers paeans to the corporate gods of the music industry: Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis and the News, MOR - anyone whose work justifies the solipsistic lifestyle he leads - but what he says is often so self-contradictory we wonder if he's actually thought about any of it, or learned it wholesale from the album covers and magazines. His monologuing is usually amusing, but we learn fairly quickly that it is not a good sign; people have a tendency to die when Bateman starts talking about music. In fact, people have a tendency to die when they're around Bateman in general, and this only increases in frequency as the movie progresses.

There are many murders in this film, but the viewer is gratefully spared seeing any of them in any sort of detail. The book goes into grisly, delighted in an almost Julia Child-ish way, detail about the killings; here director Mary Harron has the good sense to keep much of the gore off-screen. It was not, in fact, for violence and gore that the film originally got an NC-17 rating, but for a rather risqu three-way sex scene. Five or six seconds cut from the theatrical release (but restored on this ""uncut"" DVD along with eight other scenes, of varying quality and importance) got it an R-rating instead, but honestly, unless you really pay attention you'll never notice the added footage, and it's no more graphic than what was left in.

The film definitely deserves its R-rating, but the violence and the sex are done in such a way that they are not mean or vicious towards the victims, only towards Bateman, who is never made to look anything but a total idiot. These scenes are really more humourous than revolting, though that sounds callous to those who haven't seen the film. Bateman is such a priss, such a total narcissist, that it is impossible to admire or sympathize with him. We cannot believe that the murders are going on anywhere except inside his head; we suspect he's too air-headed to really be capable of killing. Harron does not explicitly say this is the case, but it is more than implied: trails of blood vanish miraculously, chainsaws are aimed impossibly well, people who are supposed to have been murdered turn up mysteriously at restaurants, apartments full of corpses become miraculously empty. Bateman has a way of occupying empty space that makes him completely unmemorable even to his own lawyer, and the end of the film is the strongest argument for everything having gone on in his own twisted mind.

Christian Bale is a complete marvel in this role. I have been a fan since his heart-wrenching performance ages ago in ""Empire of the Sun,"" though here he has clearly grown up and could not be more different. It speaks well for his versatility that he could go from the youthfully innocent Demetrius in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" the year before, to the utterly indifferent Patrick Bateman here, to the stoic and thoroughly decent Mandras in ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" the year after. This may be because Bale seems to lack any shred of self-preservation, completely giving himself over to his characters.

Here, he completely inhabits Bateman whilst simultaneously making him a 24-hour performer himself. There is nothing to Patrick Bateman: he is all posture and gesture, ""sound and fury signifying nothing,"" and Bale nails this in a dead-on performance that is far more nuanced than is often acknowledged. This is a role that could easily make an actor look ridiculous, even repulsive, yet Bale manages by throwing caution to wind to make him, if not believable, acceptable in his own peculiar fashion. It takes a very distinct courage to run down a corridor, blood-spattered and wearing nothing but tennis-shoes, bearing a mirror-polished gleaming chainsaw and screaming at the top of one's lungs. Bale has it, and manages to be so ludicrous and off-the-wall in this scene that I had time to notice that he wasn't wearing socks in his shoes, and could be more offended by this than the thought of the chainsaw. This sort of response is essential to the proper understanding and enjoyment of this movie.

The film is strongest as a commentary and exposition of the 1980s yuppie quest for world domination, though some may complain Harron is a one-note director and hammers her point home a little too well. The 80s were a decade of total narcissism, when it was ""hip to be square,"" greed was good, and one's social importance was determined largely by what restaurants one could get into on a Friday night. (This is, in fact, the inspiration for one of Bateman's murderous rages.) By carrying these themes into the exaggerated, hyper-macho world of corporate takeovers, Harron is able to more fully explore them. Here, Bateman's murders become the logical if radical extensions of Wall Street's corporate aggressiveness, and ""mergers and acquisitions"" are not so far removed from ""murders and executions,"" and his utter indifference to anyone but himself is the reasonable end of the dehumanizing of the corporate machine.",1121472000,6,7213,4.921117502054232
70328,5,0783243499,"I read some pretty bad reviews of this new DVD on the site, but I have to disagree.  I am a hard-core American Psycho fan and think it's one of the best, least known cult classic films around.  It's getting more exposure now with Bale's ""Batman"" fame, but start-to-finish, this movie has always been one of the funniest and entertaining films in a long time.

The reason this DVD is important (""crucial, really"") to own is because of the five deleted scenes.  All five are very original and not just different takes or segments of scenes already in the film.  You won't believe the one of Bateman and Courtney in bed, and the Bale-Witherspoon exchange in another scene is priceless.  I was dying (pardon the pun) laughing all night after I bought this.

I do agree, however, that while the makers of this DVD have all the characteristics of human beings - flesh, blood, skin, hair - they don't possess a single, clear, identifiable emotion except for greed, and disgust.",1121212800,2,970,4.670588235294118
70329,4,0783243499,"Usually it's the other way around. To say that the movie is better than the book isn't saying much. Although its gruesome murders drew feminist fire and made headlines and best-seller lists, ""American Psycho"" isn't literature and isn't read today. But this film version is assured DVD shelf life because it largely replaces the gore with the satire that might have improved the book. It may have surprised author Bret Easton Ellis more than audiences that the movie emerged from all the controversy as a chilling, amusing examination of urban alienation. It's not the bloodbath that fans of Quentin Tarentino or George Romero might have expected.

The movie does pay its thriller dues (and paid dearly for its NC-17 rating.) But the filmmakers have more than thrills in mind. They tip their hand with a credit sequence that draws us into a high rise world of sleek bodies and correct addresses. We see drops of blood splashing onto a white surface, then streams of blood, then - - - but wait, it's not blood at all but red syrup and rasberries garnishing plates in a Manhattan restaurant. They're being served to jaded young Wall Streeters who like to trade business cards, wisecracks and insider gossip.

Suddenly, ""American Psycho"" is off and running in another direction, away from our expectations.

Stay with it, even after I tell you that our young financier takes an axe to a colleague, has a fridge full of heads and a closet full of bodies, tapes his sexual threesomes, and that at one point he chases a blonde through his apartment building brandishing a chainsaw, naked and covered in blood. Repellent? Yes, but this is a serious movie with serious themes and a serious actor, Christian Bale, wielding the weapons. Reese Witherspoon and Willem Dafoe make appearances but Bale is the whole show. His telephone confession near the end is a sensational piece of film acting.

Nonetheless, you may want to deprive your children and elderly parents of this cinematic experience at this particular time in their lives.",1121126400,,2023,4.906432748538012
70330,4,0783243499,"First of all, the book is brilliant.  It is stomach-churning, it is haunting and it gets under your skin for a long time after.

Several have said the book is Misogynist - this is an ignorant simplification.  If anything, the book plays against a misogynist attitude.  It tells the story in first person of a person who sees women as sex objects, and wants what he can get out of them.  This has been focussed on heavily by those who did not understand the book as it was a way of criticising something they didn't get without being accused of being censorial.

Let it be clear: the character is misogynist because he grew out of a misogynist world: the '70s and '80s world of power and money.  This book critiques that world and the human products it produced.  It is not promoting misogyny any more than it is promoting killing dogs and blinding homeless people.  This man is reprehensible, and turns the camera on the reader/viewer to question why you feel enough sympathy to want Patrick Bateman to get away with murder (and torture, rape and animal cruelty).

So, with that cleared up, on to the movie.  I have mixed feelings about the conversion from book to film.  Christian Bale fleshes out the character brilliantly, and is by far the greatest asset of the film.  The screenplay decided to head off in a different direction to the book towards the end and question reality and fantasy.  It is only by accepting this end goal that one can excuse the scene where a chainsaw dropped down several flights of stairs manages to hit a girl with the business end still running and kill her.

Willem Dafoe is a solid actor who struggles with a role that doesn't really suit him, but does the best he can.

The biggest problem with the film is in the end inevitable:  That it lacks the violent punch of the book.  Hollywood is far too weak-willed and fawning to ever allow a movie to be made of American Psycho that addresses the violence and its implications as portrayed in the book.  Perhaps somewhere in Eastern Europe the movie could be made without being Disney-fied, but never in America, and certainly not now in the era of Bush Jr.  Ironically, I don't think even THIS movie could be made in the current political climate.

So is it horrible and gruesome?  No.  Does it raise questions about money, power and abuse? Yes.  Does it degrade women?  No.  Does it show women being degraded in an environment where money and power are abused?  Absolutely.  That's one of the ideas positted in the book which made it to the film.  So should you see the movie?  Yes.  Should you read the book?  If you have the stomach for it, it may well open your eyes.",1120694400,3,2654,4.522105263157894
70331,5,0783243499,"Not having read the book, i bought this on DVD and watched it for the first time. I must say i'm blown away by 3 things about it. First, Christian Bale's acting is superb. Some of the best acting i've seen in a while as a matter of fact. Second, the movie is highly entertaining with not one part of it being boring. As soon as it starts, you're sucked into the movie's reality and you really don't want to 'get out', for want of a better term. And finally, Three, i'm amazed at why it's taken me so long to get around to seeing this. I always thought it was just another ""Slasher"" kind of film. I didn't really have any motivation for seeing it until now, and it's really paid off.

Like i said, as soon as this movie starts, you're sucked into it's reality. It's set in 1987, and it's such a movie in that you actually do start to wonder if it WAS made in 1987. The hairstyles, the clothes, the phones, the cars..everything makes it look like the late 80's. And of course, Cocaine is the drug of choice, and Hookers are used and abused frequently by all the Yuppies in town as well. And in the middle of all that, we have our main character Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale. As i said, the acting is extremely good. Bale is pretty much THE perfect choice for the role.

One of the highlights of the movie, and i stress the ""One of.."" part of that, is the ending. I really don't know how to explain it without giving away the ending, but i must say the ending is truly awesome. This movie is dark, violent and altogether very cold. It does have that cold atmosphere about it. After watching this movie too, i really want to check out the book. I've heard it's pretty much word-for-word and almost exactly the same, except more violent, but i still think it'd be very interesting. Also, that's not to say this movie isn't 'violent' either, because it really is in some parts. There is one part where Christian Bale is running naked down the hallway, chainsaw in hand, covered in blood, trying to murder a Hooker. So it is pretty violent in some parts, and basically the whole movie has a dark and violent atmosphere behind it.

If you enjoyed Donnie Darko, Fight Club or even The Shining, you will no doubt enjoy this great movie. It won't leave you feeling uplifted and happy, but nor should it. It's not that type of movie and isn't trying to be, obviously. In a word it's unsettling, as the title of my review says. I highly recommend it, if you have or have not read the book.

Christian Bale (Patrick Bateman) is a quite the perfectonist, his whole day is completley sheduled. From his fememine face masks to his daily workout not too mention his awesome taste in women, he is a mans man in my book.

70339,4,0783243499,"Mary Harron's American Psycho (based on the infamous Bret Easton Ellis novel) is really quite a brilliant movie. I recall seeing it five years ago when it first came out, but never really appreciated it much until I saw it again recently. I remember liking it when I first saw it, but found it rather disturbing. Watching it again, I realized what a brilliant comedy it actually is. It's not a thriller at all, it's completely a dark comedy. A very dark comedy. It brilliantly satirizes the ""yuppie"" lifestyle by portraying young businessmen as hollow, soulless robots whose only concerns are: A) having an expensive apartment, B) Having a nice, stylish business card and C) Getting reservations to the nicest, most expensive restaurants in town. Director Harron portrays these people almost as inhuman, and in the case of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), unfeeling and homicidal. Christian Bale gives an amazing performance as Bateman the yuppie psycho. Bale alone makes the film worth watching. His character is cold, arrogant and able to murder an innocent person without batting an eyelash. There's a very memorable scene where Bateman slaughters a coworker with an axe while discussing the music of Huey Lewis and the News. Christian Bale is always believable as the meticulous, obsessive psycho.

I feel that as a whole, American Psycho doesn't completely work. Towards the end, it feels a little bit aloof and ends rather abruptly. There's really not much of a conventional story, so that detracts from it a little bit. However, the movie is so well directed and acted and so on-target with its satire, that I can easily overlook its flaws. Don't watch it expecting a horror movie or a suspense thriller. Many people are bound to misunderstand it, but American Psycho is really an intelligent, razor-sharp dark comedy.

Add the absolutely flawless (not a term I would ever use lightly) performance of Christian Bale, and you have a near perfect picture.

70347,5,0783243499,"The more I think about Bret Easton Ellis's novel ""American Psycho,"" the more I consider it a member of the exclusive ""Great American Novel"" club. Perhaps I'm being premature in arguing that this graphic novel about a rich but soulless young man in the throes of materialistic excess ranks alongside such monumental novels as Sinclair Lewis's ""Main Street"" or Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy,"" but that's exactly what I am saying. I predict that the coming decades will see Ellis's novel elevated to the pantheon of great American literature, a novel so indicative of its time and place that future generations will read it in order to gain insight into certain segments of our culture. Like other great novels about the American experience, ""American Psycho"" doesn't cover all the bases--America is too diverse for a single author to capture its total essence in a single novel. But what it does touch upon strikes at a central tenet of our society, namely our greed for things and our inability to strike a balance between laissez-faire capitalism and regulated market systems. We learned in the 1980s that ""Greed is good."" Ellis's novel shows us how that greed taken to its farthest extension is anything but good.

Predictably, someone made a film based on the book--a director named Mary Harron to be exact--starring Christian Bale as the titular psycho Patrick Bateman. Pat seems to have everything the American dream promises: good looks, money, a good lineage, an ivy league education, beautiful women, nice digs, all the accoutrements that come with being a member of the American social elite. He is also, according to his own observations, a raving lunatic prone to outbursts of horrific violence. The smallest incidents cause our anti-hero to embark on epic excursions of bloody mayhem, from a colleague producing a better business card than the ones Patrick carries to a homeless man on the street who has the temerity to ask for money. He has a propensity to blurt out the most outrageous statements to his equally slick pals and numerous girlfriends, statements about heads on sticks and how he works in ""murders and executions,"" but no one seems to notice or care that much. Even more amazing, no one seems to notice Patrick Bateman lapsing into murderous insanity. But why would they? He's one of them, one of the cream of the crop, and is certainly not the sort of scoundrel who would murder and maim harridans, business associates, or anyone else who happens to cross his path.

In fact, we can never be entirely sure the murders and tortures are reality or just figments of Bateman's fragmented and vacuous personality. More likely these egregious acts, acts which include chasing a woman around an apartment building with a chainsaw or burying an axe in the noggin of an associate named Paul Allen (Jared Leto), represent attempts to feel something beyond the mere superficiality provided by material goods. Then again, maybe not. A cop named Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) does turn up at Bateman's office from time to time to inquire about the whereabouts of the aforementioned Allen. It's to the film's credit that we can never quite say for sure if Bateman is responsible for all of these atrocities, but that is also the conclusion we reach with the book. What we know for certain is how useless this guy's life really is. All he does is show up for work so he can goof off, listen to music, try and obtain reservations at the latest hip restaurants, and exercise. He's really nothing and he knows it. Watching these yuppies preen and prance through expensive set pieces evokes an equally useless class of do-nothings, i.e. the European nobility of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Come to think of it, some of those barons, dukes, and earls engaged in mass murder as well.

The only problem I had with the film version of ""American Psycho"" isn't really a major problem at all. In order to get a rating that would allow theaters to show the picture, Harron had to tone down the gore considerably. The book is loaded with stomach churning descriptions of Bateman's atrocities that only get worse as his insanity increases. Even an unrated version of the film couldn't begin to bring to the screen many of these nightmares, but that's o.k. What we do get is highly disturbing thanks largely to the marvelous skills of actor Christian Bale in the lead role. In a film loaded with talent--including Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, and Willem Dafoe--Bale easily holds his own and then some as the savage psychotic. His voiceovers describing his inner sensations send chills down the spine yet he's equally at ease with the book's black humor. It's amazing there are times you won't know whether you should laugh or shriek in terror at Bateman's latest escapade. If you haven't read the book, which I recommend before watching the film, you might need to view the picture several times to absorb the bleak social commentary.

Extras on the disc include production notes, cast biographies, a trailer, an interview with Bale, and a making of featurette. I'll leave you with a typical Bateman statement: ""There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing."" Enough said, eh?",1107648000,11,5763,4.853658536585366
70348,5,0783243499,"Hey! I haven't seen you in here before, but I *have* seen you, right---didn't we meet at Dorsia? Yeah, I know it's tough to get reservations there, but trust me---I can get them anytime. I'm connected with the Maitre D'. Dinner, say Friday, say eight? Where do you work out, anyway?

Since we're talking Movers and Shakers, let me introduce you to my homeskillet Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, who completely owns the film)---he's the go-to guy in Mergers & Acquisitions at Pierce & Pierce, Wall Street investment banking hotshot, hooking up with Upper East Side fashion maven and society diva Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon, compulsively consuming)---the lucky dog!---and frankly, between the two of us, the guy you want to talk to to cuff your links, tie your knots, and give you the low-down on the best shoes to accent your Hugo Boss or Armani. PC before PC was cool. Big on the enviroment, nuclear freeze, health care, education, helping out the poor and downtrodden, stamping out genocide in Sri Lanka. Boy Next Door.

Monster and Serial Killer.

Yep, Patrick is big on buying industrial nail guns, stapling witless prostitutes to the floor, touching them up with a little acid facial, topping that off with some mace, and storing their heads in his Sub-Zero high-end refrigerator/freezer unit. He wants to fit in, our Patrick, but you know, a man's got to have hobbies. Norman Bates said it perfectly when he noted ""we all go a little crazy sometimes"".

OK, granted, bad example. But Jesus, a man's got to---you know---*vent* sometimes.

When I heard they were making Bret Easton Ellis's study in psychosis and carnal yuppiedom ""American Pyscho"" into a movie, I thought it couldn't be done. Then I heard Mary Harron was helming it, and I sighed with bliss: Harron's ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" was a kind of cinematic kindred spirit to American Psycho, both delving into the mental states of complete gibbering lunatics no one took seriously.

I see you're staring at my shoes---they're Allen-Edmonds wingtips (USD 795). Oh, you're not? Where was I? Is that Donald Trump?

Anyway, the flick chronicles our man Bateman---a practical GQ fashion & hygiene expert, I might add!---in his days as Wall Street guru, his nights as impromptu surgeon. He's a great authority on Huey Lewis & the News, which you can hear on his state-of-the-art B&O surround sound system (USD 25,000), accompanied by Bateman's ever-astute commentary---that is, if you can hear it over the screams.

He exults in six-pack abs. He keeps his skin nice and taut and rosy with all sorts of unguents and admixtures. He has a great tan, compliments of his little tanning sarcophagus. He hits the club scene and comes home with dinner, dinner that talks and thinks and hopes. He keeps those abs bristling with daily workouts, accompanied to porn tapes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He'd better damn sure have a better business card than you.

Harron takes liberties with Ellis's material, but captures the essentials like a champ. This isn't a gory flick---not by a longshot, given that the literary Bateman liked introducing a starving wharf rat into the nether regions of his victims---but it gets the point across.

Bateman tearing through a high end West Side penthouse with a chainsaw (my God, the boy has good aim!). Bateman administering the coup de grace to a bum, then stomping the bum's cowering doggy to death. Bateman feeding a kitten to the friendly neighborhood ATM (it says FEED ME A KITTEN---honestly, could you resist? Not I!). Bateman despairing at being outdone by his wretched rival Paul Allen (the incomparable Jared Leto, smirking and smarmy to the exceptionally bitter end).

From what's for dinner on the menu at New York's high end eateries (might I recommend the Dauphin Gratinois with the Lobster frappe?), to the existential agonies of getting a good table at Dorsia, to the shame of living in even a good Upper West Side apartment (with doorman), Harron nails the raw bloody guts of the No-Exit damnation lurking at the black, fetid, festering, maggot-ridden heart of High Society---or any society, for that matter. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula gives Harron full air support---and he should, since he did the camera-work for Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Four Rooms. Stuff looks good here.

Bale put me off on my first viewing---his campy smile, his goofy voice, his off-kilter mannerisms---but he's perfect. Bateman isn't in control, after all: he thinks his mask is slipping, when it's already on the floor and shunting down the drain.

Frankly, all the acting is first-rate: Samantha Mathis Xanax'd to perfection as Bateman's mistress and free-range society delectation Courtney, Matt Ross as the hideous Luis Carruthers, Justin Theroux owning yet another bit part as Bryce, Josh Lucas note-perfect as McDermott, Chloe Sevigny is at her cringing, cloying best---my god, it's hard not to adore her---and Willem Dafoe as the police detective, looming like a stormcloud about to break that never really does, and proving---with his face alone---that Sam Raimi was off his rocker to even *think* about putting Dafoe in a mask as the Green Goblin. Fool.

Some call this satire. Ignore them. This is pure, unadulterated horror; Pat Bateman's midnight outtings are consequence and causality of our wearing one too many masks to placate society: the Beast must get out! It must eat!

Why are you staring at my tie (Forzieri, USD 275.00)? Nah, that's not blood---it's spaghetti sauce from lunch, silly. Anyway, I gotta hop---time is money, and I've got to return some videotapes.",1105488000,7,5581,5.044516829533116
70349,5,0783243499,"I think a lot of reviewers who are trashing this movie are doing so because they have absolutely no understanding of the context in which it is supposed to take place. I know that this is difficult for some people to understand, but because American Psycho is a satire, a COMEDY, it is really key to understand what is being made fun of, what the filmmaker's primary target is, before trashing this and saying you are all upset and disgusted and don't understand and want to cry. Indeed, if you have been living in a bunker for the last 25 years, or were born after the year 2000, you may not be aware of the existence of such ""obscure"" cultural phenomena as: the 80's, New York, yuppieness in general, Wall Street, techno music, cocaine, big hair, prostitution, and exactly why Paul Allen's apartment makes Bateman's heart sink. But that is not the fault of American Psycho. Also, while this movie is obviously a gory and ""twisted"" movie (to use everyone's favorite word) it is ultimately kind of innocent because it's just a joke, it is a big gaffe. Really it is not fair that this movie has 3.5 stars on average; really, the vast majority of negative reviewers of this movie are so undeveloped in their basic comprehension of what is going on here - shocking as that is - that their reviews seem pretty meaningless. That's just my opinion.
There are other elemets to the movie as a whole that the nay-sayers seem to pick up on. First and foremost is the actual ambiguity and even veracity of certain events. One interpretation of the film is that for whatever reason, Bateman has slipped into a psychological state where he himself is literally unaware of the events that are depicted in turn.

Furthermore, for all of you who complain that this movie is ""sexist"" in that it [encourages] ""violence against women"" I would say that that is a rather shallow interpretation of a pretty brilliant movie that, if you see the bonus features on the DVD, was written and directed by several GLBT women, Guinevere Turner being one of them - one of the best writers around IMHO.",1105142400,2,2070,4.625

70353,3,0783243499,"Now I have to say that when I first saw this movie (on opening day) I saw it for two reasons. One was I love Chritian Bale. And the other was for Brett Easton Ellis. Although at the time I hadnt read this book, I had only read ""Less than Zero"" and that was close to ten years earlier.

First I will review the movie to people who have not read the book and then I will review it to those who have.

This is basically a movie about a serial killer. Although this is a bit different. The killer happens to be a rich, young, good looking wallstreet executive. This is also a black comedy, with some of the funniest lines you'll ever hear. It is also a period movie with meticulous details to the mid to late 1980's.

When I left the movie I was confused. Did he kill all those people? Was it only his imagination? Was it a comment on how we all have homicidal thoughts or immoral thoughts but we don't act on them? What was going on????? Well when I had only seen the movie my assumption was that he did not kill anyone. It was all a sick fantasy and he was just crazy, but not a killer. After reading the book I have completely changed my mind. Because there are too many things left out of the movie that if they were in it I would have though otherwise.

Now there are some moments in the book which I feel are key to the story that never made it in the movie. One of them was his meeting with his ex-girlfriend. This is one of the few times we see Patrick as close to human. He is nervous, sweaty and intimidated by this woman. Which also has the best ""twist"" of the book with her new boyfriend being the head chef at ""Dorsia"", that illusive and chic resteraunt he can never get a reservation for.

There are moments in the movie where the dialogue is dead on and ripped straight from the book, which I love. But most of the other times the dialogue is borrowed from one charachter and given to another. The scenes are blended into eachother for whatever reason and so much is left out. The movie is by far less graphic. And it also moves too quickly. I believe the book takes place over an almost two year period where the movie is in about a 6 month stretch of time.

Also in the book I don't think anything bad happens for nearly 100 pages or so. But in the movie in the first 5 minutes he makes a comment to a waitress about killing her. That buildup in the book was really important. You knew he would snap, but it was taking a long time to build everything.

Also there is the detective that I have a problem with. In the book he is young, attractive and dresses as well as Patrick. In the movie he is played by a much older and less attractive Willem Defoe.

Also the realtionship with his secretary is totally stripped down to bare bones and doesnt get anywhere near what it is in the book. I really disliked that.

If your a fan of the book Im sure youve seen it. If you haven't it's worth it to watch anyway even with all it's faults. It's a hard book and Im not sure if it could be made into a movie well. Although Id like to see someone try again.

If you haven't read the book then you should still see the movie. If you like Christian Bale you will see him in a whole new light. He also pulled off a role that Im not sure anyone else could.

I gave it a 3 star rating because of the issues I have with book/versus movie. But its still entertaining and a good converstation will happen after you watch it with someone.",1098921600,3,3432,4.099850968703428

70355,4,0783243499,"This movie along with the book shows off the worst of a man in a ""master of the universe"" context in Wall Street. Basically, it's purgatory in Yuppie hell, with only guilt complex and knowledge about his psychosis tormenting Bateman (Christian Bale).

Bateman represents the embodiment of what a successful young, single, white yuppie living in the 80's in upper class New York would do in any given day. Eating gourmet food, drinking hard liquor, doing coke, working out extensively, clubbing insanely and of course, goofing off work by watching television or listening to your favourite walkman. He's a walking, talking perfection of what a greedy, materialistic and ultimately insecure creature of the 80's. He's the product that Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street"" would love.

This DVD edition is the unrated NC-17 cut. Highly recommended, even though you just get a few more seconds of simulated sex. However, the extras are quite disappointing. Would love to see a fully loaded 2 disc special edition in the near future.",1096329600,7,1024,5.089285714285714

70357,4,0783243499,"It was around three years ago when I first saw this movie, and I loved it. It's not something I could watch all the time, but every few months I stick it in the DVD player if I can't find anything else to watch.

Christian Bale's performance was fantastic. I honestly couldn't think of anyone else more suited to the part. He looks, talks and acts precisely as he should and his entire character was believable. Most people seem to think that Reese Witherspoon was not so great, but I liked her- the part she played was the same as most of her other parts, whiny and ditzy, and the role suited her down to the ground.

This film is amusing, although I wasn't sure whether it was supposed to be or not! I love the way that Patrick Bateman talks about music and morality as he openly prepares to kill his latest victim, and they don't even notice. Jean is the only character that I didn't like. She seemed a bit hollow and sort of dull. From the way she was portrayed, you can tell she is very wary of Bateman, and I'm surprised that the film didn't allow her to explore the suspicions she obviously felt towards Bateman.

All in all though, I think my favourite parts of this movie is when Bateman is describing himself and his emotions. It's really insightful and very well researched.

This movie has some slightly shocking moments, but these become quite funny the second time you watch because you already know what's going to happen, and you can appreciate it's rather morbid comedy value.",1090972800,5,1493,4.477941176470588
70358,3,0783243499,"The argument was that ""American Psycho"" was not really a look at a serial killer but rather a satirical expose on yuppie executives circa the mid-1980s. However, as far as I am concerned this 2000 film fails on both scores. There is a lot of blood but neither a sense of horror nor suspense, which is usually what you want to find in a thriller. As for the social satire, the problem is that the character of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and the rest of his wall street execu-yuppies are all so fake, more reminiscent of a comedy sketch on ""Mad TV"" than anything else, and I would think the point would be to capture more of the real essence of such a life (e.g., ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" or ""The Boiler Room"").

 The film was directed by Mary Harron (""I Shot Andy Warhol""), who also did the screenplay, which probably explains why the Bret Easton Ellis novel has been toned down for the silver screen. The point being made, as near as I can tell, is that Patrick Bateman kills people, not because he is so very different from everyone else around him, but essentially because he is just like the rest of his cohorts, only more so. Some of the murders appear to be random and others the result of jealousy, but sometimes the best answer is that the death speaks to Bateman's vanity. The whole opening of ""American Psycho"" is an introduction to his narcissism, which means it provides the prime motivation for not only his murderous outbursts but also everything else in his life.

 Because everything fits the pattern I have to work from the premise that the film is what the director intended, but it just does not achieve the desired result. My prediction is that if you bother to watch this film, then at some point you are going to burst out laughing and dollars to donuts it will be for some unintentional reason. Furthermore, as you watch the film you will find yourself thinking of a whole lot of films that suddenly look a lot better when compared to ""American Psycho"" (""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""Showgirls"" were just the first two that came to mind). I am willing to grant that Harron was trying to do something to redeem the original novel, but this film just fails across the board, whether we are talking the sex and the violence or the psychological insights and social satire.",1090713600,,2292,4.528985507246377

To be honest, I enjoy gore very much and I don't expect a good plot from a horror movie, not even from American Psycho. I knew it would be stupid, long before I watched it, but a friend of mine told me it was funny. So I thought: ""What the hell."" This movie was distasteful, even to me. And another thing, the amount of sex incorporated into this film, is pointless. I think the film's director put that amount because she is a woman and just wants to prove to people, that she can be just as dirty as any male director.

The movie was directed by Mary Herron, and was done really well. The cast includes Christian Bale, Jared Leto, Chlo Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Willem Dafoe.
'American Psycho' is about a rich businessman Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who, during the day anyway is a charming guy, but sometimes he just wants to kill whenever he feels the urge.
DVD Features include Production notes, Theatrical Trailers, Making of 'American Psycho', and a Christian Bale interview. Overall this DVD is worth every penny you pay for it.",1082937600,2,680,4.870689655172414
70362,5,0783243499,"Crazy. Confusing. Entertaining. Funny ('feed me a stray cat'). Totally bizarre! This is simply an awesome film! Bale gives a perfect performance of Patrick Bateman, if you've read the book you'll know what to expect, its not exactly the sort of film your mother would enjoy but i really urge everyone to see this movie. The supporting cast all do their jobs well (look out for a young reese witherspoon) but Bale well and truly steals the show and is so effortlessly ingaging as Bateman i have found myself watching films purely if he is in them. Check out the memorable quotes to see some of the great one liners to be found in this truly spectacular film.
The film is thought provoking and to a degree quite scary as it makes you really think about the normal looking guy at work that little bit different. A must see.

70363,5,0783243499,"American Psycho...murder, clubs, sex, drugs, and 80's right? Wrong. A lot of people saw the title and must of thought about 'oh just another kill movie.' No. American Psycho is not a killing spree movie. It is a well plotted film, and since being a huge fan of the book, I thought this movie hit the book like a hammer on a nail. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is smart, intelligent, rich, and lives the life that most people can only dream of. He is everything I thought of Patrick Bateman in the book. A couple of things that they missed was Patrick Bateman's excessive details; The Patty Winters Show, and what he wears and what his friends wear. I guess that the screeplay writers didn't want to bore the audidence with his excessive detail about everything he see's as in the book. The story takes place in NYC in the 80's with him going to fancy dinners, and work. Although we don't know what he does since Bret Easton Ellis didn't want to tell us what Patrick Bateman did for a living. So there are times where he does talk to his fiancee Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon, which I think she tried a little to hard during the upsetting parts in the film), and he is always mistakn for someone who works wirh him since they all look alike; slick back hair, designer clothes, nice bodies, and good looks. Some of the disturbing parts is when he does kill, but I felt that the movie was not too violent enough like the book. The book was full of gore and I didn't mind seeing it in the movie, and the sex scenes were not up to par with the scenes in the book, but if it was then, American Psycho would of have been rated XXX because the scenes in the book describe sex like it is shown in XXX rated films. In all, the movie was beautifully described and tell told. Now in the end, it is where you have to think, bur I am not going to spoil the ending because it is very strange but yet very entertaining.",1080950400,2,1902,4.286111111111111

The first one wasn't really entertaining nor was the second, but this one was. ""Americian Psycho"" was repeatedly rewinded over and over again, it was basically the best movie out there.
  A rich man Patrick Baitman, in New York is a psycho killer because of these pills tat he takes, noone suspects that it's him because he has such a great reputation so he kills prostitutes, coworkers and some homeless people. His rich friends include, Timothy Bryce ( Justin Theroux ) and other co workers.
  Him and his fiance are both having an affair with other people and they thik that the other doesn't know about it. Patrick never really proposed but his fiance has bought an engagment ring and is planning the weddin.g Patrick doesn't want to get married but doesn't leave his fiance until the end of the movie.
  Patrick and his friends go clubbing, do drugs such as cocaine and steriods, but keeping in mind this movie is taking place in the 80's so they don't know about all the bad stuff yet.

70368,5,0783243499,"Just wanted to get something off my chest. Those who have reviewed this film and commented that it is NOT an insight into the mind of a serial killer need to do some more research.
We are only now starting to understand the psychopathic condition and discover what motivates one to become a serial killer. This film's portrayal of Bateman as an empty shell, a man on the outside with nothing inside is very accurate. Psychopaths do not have the social skills or moral limitations that ""normal"" people do. They have to learn these things in order to ""fit in"" as Bateman says. Otherwise they would be as obviously different as an alien life form. When Patrick says that we might be able to see him and hear him but ""I simply do not exist"", I think this is the clearest, most insightful comment on a psychopathic personality that I have ever seen in a movie.",1079481600,,855,4.487179487179487

The reason for 4 is that like many critics this film trys to be many things but the people who say that it is trying to be a slasher are tottally wrong and probly rented the movie for the violence or don't read between lines or reels. Is it a social satire yes on the 80's Matiralism or ""me"" genration etc. The odd thing is that the 2 min they cut out (a scene in which patrick looks at himself during a sex act) is more evidence what the movie is trying to say Patrick is so crazy that all he can think about is him his things and what people think about him. To get a better perspective read the book which in itself is more sexual and more violent then this movie could ever be but all those action explain who patrick is not what he does. Yes there are better way better films but if your looking for something weird, (but not out there) and new buy the movie, but if you like the movie for what it says pick up the book since in many ways is totally differint but still has the same message.",1077667200,,1136,4.008810572687224
70370,3,0783243499,"For some reason, this movie is classified as horror.  It is not - it is a comedy: a very, very, very black comedy.  Just watch Christian Bale's over-the-top performance - everything is played for laughs.  The murders are not the focus of the film - rather it is Bale's narration as he comments on all things `80s: everything from his in-depth analysis of pop artists like Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis, to his grooming ritual, to whatever hot spots were popular in New York back then.
The eighties as satirized in the movie are an idea that never really existed - much like Patrick's idea of himself.  I vaguely remember some of the places he talks about in Manhattan, but they were trends - like anything else.  Even the yuppies back then who agonized over getting the right seat at the right restaurant and having the perfect look and business card didn't even really believe in those things themselves.  They were all playacting, whether they knew it or not.
It is a wise decision to downplay the horror aspects of the movie.  Sadly I have not read the book.  I hear that is very misogynistic.  I don't know about that but the hero-villain, Patrick Bateman, certainly is.  Violence against women is not something we need to see more of.  It is present in the film, so be prepared for some offensive scenes.
This movie, like other movies about the eighties, play best as nostalgia.  We can look at the cultural differences and say, ""What the hell were we thinking.""  American Psycho is intent on giving us a good laugh.",1077321600,9,1522,4.613382899628252
70371,5,0783243499,"When I walked out of the theatre after seeing this, I was blown away.  Not just by the sex and the violence, but also by the great writing, acting, and overall atmosphere of the movie.  I thought it was astonishingly raw and very good.  My companion felt the complete opposite.  This is typical of the reviews of my friends: some loved it, some hated it.  No one was in between.
What I'm trying to get across with my anecdote is that this movie, brilliant though it is, is just not for everyone.  The sex and the violence are so raw that I still find them disturbing.  However, they are nowhere near the book in terms of those (see my review of the book, coming shortly).  This movie manages to capture the important ideas and themes of the book, without the gratuitous violence.
It's still a violent movie, though.  But it has so many redeeming qualities, so don't judge it on that alone.
Some standout features:
1. The exploration of identity.
This comes through an amazingly tense scene in which Patrick Bateman, the lead, exchanges business cards with friends/rivals.  This was such a powerful scene that I find myself holding my breath whenever I watch it.  There's also a lot about mistaken identity.  I believe this is to show the utter lack of identity one had in the vile, excessive glamour of the rich in the 80s.  Everyone was interchangable.
2. Not knowing whether the killings are real or a part of Bateman's sick fantasies.
I'm inclined to go with the latter, but there are some great, skillfully ambiguous scenes that allow you to make an argument either way.
3. The music/pop culture soliloqueys
These are in the book as well, and they're fantastic.  Bateman has some interesting music tastes.  He treats the lightest pop acts with the same weight as another would treat classical composers.  These pieces are hilarious.  Even if you hate the rest of the movie, you'll love these.
This is just a great movie.  Definitely watch it, just not with a weak stomach.  And know that you will either love it or hate it.",1070928000,5,2027,4.627450980392157
70372,5,0783243499,"When I first saw this in the cinema in April 2000 I hated it. But I watched it with the wrong attitude. I was judging American Psycho as a horror film. Which it certainly is NOT. It's about (as the film constantly says) a complete [loser]. He's no friends. Unable to communicate on any level with anyone of his superficial, yuppie colleagues (some of which don't even know his name), takes far, far too much pride in his appearance and has way, way to much love for his material possessions. He is Patrick Bateman. And fitting in/looking normal/being just like everyone else is the toughest thing in his life. But murder, misogyny, degradation and mutilation is what he secretly longs for. It's really only Huey Lewis and the News that prevents him from doing so.
American Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch. You'll be watching them through the gaps between your fingers. How can you not squirm as Patrick Bateman looks in the mirror smiling, flexing his muscles, while having sex with a call girl? Or taking the whole business card thing WAY too seriously? Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious. Bateman tells Willem Dafoe's detective he would love to help him with his case but he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable. Come on! Cliff Huxtable??? Or how about the scene in the Men's Room when Patrick attempts to strangle the gay guy?
Don't watch this as a horror film. It's a comic, drama-tragedy. Patrick Bateman is a disaster waiting to happen. And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight. Though his world of slick, cocaine-snorting, superficial, Wall Street yuppies of 80s credibility is not really the thing anyone would want to be connected to. Maybe he's better off as a psycho with no pals.
The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a loud, well produced Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. The extras (apart from the deleted scenes), unfortunately, are pathetic.e movie with a scene of  Bateman discussing his morning facial cream routine) that the point of the  satire is nearly lost: Without the fickle trends of society, Bateman is an  empty shell. Save his greed and bloodlust, he is a robot.
Harron tones  down the violence to a lesser degree - although it is no less gruesome; the  scene where Bateman, nude and bloody, chases a hooker with a chainsaw is an  edge-of-the-seater - and emphasizes the story's taking place in the ""Me  Decade"" with appropriate song and fashion that add to one's enjoyment of  the film.
Despite a lame ""Is Patrick really nutso?"" twist that hurts the  movie, the point is not lost here, and Harron has a solid sophomore hit on  her hands.
Bale shines as Bateman, making us thank God the powers that be  did not go with Leonardo DiCaprio as they at one point hoped to. Whether  he's stiff, menacing, dryly sarcastic, tortured or over the edge psychotic,  Bale is mesmerizing. If there's any justice in the world, Patrick Bateman  will be a career maker.
Too bad the supporting actors don't fare as well.  With the exception of Matt Ross, who steals his scenes as a homosexual  co-worker of Bateman's in a memorable bathroom confrontation, all other  actors are window dressing. Witherspoon's role is written so blandly  anybody could have played it, while Sevigny is incredible annoying as her  characer moons over Patrick. Willem Dafoe is amiable enough as a detective  investigating one of Bateman's crimes, but ... this is Bale's movie.

I would imagine a lot of people who don't like this movie probably embrace yuppie garbage and 80's pop culture. However, to anyone who dislikes the yuppie stereotype, cheesy fake people, excesssively bad 80's music, style, and values...then you will like this movie.

But it  is a daring movie, and its sordid potrayal of a whacko's life is certainly not recommended for the faint of heart. If you look beyond the gore (which is perhaps incidental to the plot) it's actually quite a piquant satirical take on a superficial, greed orientated society.
The violence here is not gratuitous, at least to me it did not seem to be a convenient vehicle to make a voyeuristic film and shock audiences.  It surely is not a movie that investigates the innards of a psychotic killer's mind as some reviewers lament.
Ostentatiously, the plot is about an eccentric Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman (played brilliantly by Christian Bale) whose life revolves around the superficial trappings of materialism -- parties at swank bars, 1500 dollar Valentino suits, threesomes with professional women etc etc.  At first you are struck with the utter weirdness of this guy's mannerisms, no one would associate with this wacko in real life.  Bateman's attempts to out-do his peers and be noticed and accepted get more and more pathologically brutal and heinous as the story progresses. But, despite his insanity, he's desperate to be caught. The confession at the end which draws total dismissal from his peers, just reiterates the kind of society we're in.
We have a smattering of super-sardonic moments, the crescendo reached when we witness a business card comparison match between corporate peers. Or hotel reservations, the ultimate badge of Who's Who.
The film has very subtle undertones if you are willing to read between the lines. For a genre that is too often too campy, too violent without cause, and too brainless, American Psycho is a breath of fresh air. It appears campy at first. It is violent, especially towards women. But it is not brainless. I'd say it is even well written.

The movie itself shows less graphic violence than 'Fight Club', and I would say the movie's rating has a lot more to do with the sex scenes than the violence.
The movie itself is a combination of a few genres. On one hand, there are many elements of a 'slasher flick'- serial killer, bloody killings, etc. There arew also elements of a black comedy, and a 'psychological' element - we do get into Patrick Bateman's psyche, especially towards the end of the movie.
But even with all these elements, I felt that most of all, this was a period piece - about the pper class Manhatten social group, where getting a good table at the 'best'restaurant becomes an almost life or death issue, and surface and first impressions meant everything. Success was decided based on a person's platinum credit card, his business card, the blondness (and dumness) of his girlfriend, but most of all - on his ability to get a 'res'at the best restaurants.
There were very few special features on this DVD, mostly the standard (cast & crew, trailer, behind the scenes featurette, etc.). The interview with Christian Bale was enlightning, but is no substitute for a commentary.",1063497600,2,1294,4.7555555555555555
70378,4,0783243499,"what a wild in your face dark comedy about the excess of the 80's lifestyle.  Bale is excellent at depicting a character who has become so shallow and empty that he rebels in his American Psycho way.  Scenes like Bateman in the shower and his morning prep routine and the business card comparisons are hysterical in the way the point out some of the absurdities and foolishness of this era.  Bale is so slick and so wired in his extremes in behaviour and his voice over dialogues are performed to perfection. It is so subversively witty - that the social aspects of this time come across as almost more scary than the violence.  Were we that bad?  Other performances are great here too: dafoe, mathis, leto, and Chloe Sevigny who is the only one who can actually steal her scenes away from Bale.  I used to work with a bunch of Patrick Batemans who had too much too early and too easy - I wonder what happened to them.",1055548800,2,918,4.402366863905326
70379,3,0783243499,"I read ""American Psycho"" before I saw the movie and I'm very glad I did. My reading the book prepared me for the disturbing images I would ultimately see on the screen. Christian Bale did an excellent job of portraying the monstrous yet calm Patrick Bateman in a story that takes place in the 1980s.
The story mainly revolves around a man in his twenties who is very successful on Wall Street in New York City. He seems very charming and normal to just about all who meet him - he even has a fiance played very well by Reese Witherspoon. However, what these people don't know is that under that charming exterior lies a vicious killer who must satisfy his need to kill whenever the mood strikes. Even though he does possess the traits of a killer, there are also some lighter scenes in the movie. The scene where Patrick and his co-workers discuss their business cards will bring a smile to your face. It's amazing how the type of paper or ink used on a card can be so important and almost seem life-threatening to these men. Their entire level of status rested upon a small card.
You will probably find yourself in shock throughout most of the film, but sometimes that can be a good thing. This is not a regular film that one goes to see for enjoyment. This film was made to make you feel uncomfortable and make you take a serious look at the sort of things that go on in the world everyday. The ending will have you second-guessing yourself and make you think, ""How did that happen?""

70381,5,0783243499,"American Psycho may well be one of the most misunderstood films in recent history. First off, this film is a comedy, albeit a very dark one; second, the violence takes place offscreen, allowing the symbolism of the film to take center stage.
The film is not so much about the excess of the 1980s, as it is the emptiness of the sheer pursuit of all things superficial. The central character, Patrick Batemen (played by the brilliant Christian Bale), epitomizes emptiness, something he himself knows. He comments early on that while he may seem to be as human as everyone else, there is merely ""an idea of a Patrick Bateman,"" and in truth, he just ""isn't there.""
The film follows Bateman's odyssey through what appears to be a violent killing spree, motivated, it seems, sheerly by the desire for sensation.  Whether the violence is actually happening, or merely a metaphor, the lingering question gives the film its depth. It's hard to imagine an actor more perfect for this role than Christian Bale, who finally got a chance to show off his chops in AP. It's equally hard to believe Bale is actually British, as his accent is so flawlessly perfect. (He's also quite easy on the eyes, which certainly doesn't hurt.)
American Psycho is one of those films you can watch over and over, and continually see new things. Every frame seems to have been carefully designed, and the visuals are stunning. Bateman's apartment, for example, is all white, startlingly sterile, and shows no sign of personality or individuality whatsover. The apartment, like many other images in the film, speaks volumes.
Ambiguity about gender, sexual preference, reality, meaning, and nearly everything is clearly deliberate. Does anything mean *anything*? Is life inherently meaningless? Can external beauty disguise internal ugliness? Does it? Should it?
American Psycho, in any format, is a ride and a half. It's entertaining, hilariously and frighteningly funny, and powerfully thought-provoking. I believe American Psycho is one of the greatest films of the latter half of the 20th century, and will be considered so, if only in retrospect. See it expecting greatness, and, guaranteed, you'll find it.",1047427200,16,2178,5.100840336134453
70382,4,0783243499,"American Psycho, the book, seems like an easy fit to the screen in terms of visuals.  But what's difficult to transfer to the film is the actual excess of style.  For instance, in the book you can note the actual style in which the book is structured.  There are entire chapters that, by the style they're done in and the placement they're given, tell the reader that they are non-essential.  The rants on Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the News--these run 5-6 pages in the book and are best skipped.  (Though if you go through them you find some great lines.)  In a film it's difficult to do that because they would equate to 5 more minutes on the running time and a bored audience.
Anyway, onto the film.  I thought American Psycho was as good an adaptation as anyone could hope for if they're a fan of the book.  Mary Harron (a female director making the ultimate movie about ""men behaving badly"" as she puts it in the featurette) does two things: she makes the film a real treat for those who read the book, and she makes the film funny and witty enough for those just wondering what the fuss is.  Plenty of people will figure out what the book must have been like once they see the movie.
I don't where to start except to say you owe it yourself to see this excellent independent film.  ...  Christian Bale is amazing as Patrick Bateman.  The accent is great, the facial expressions priceless (that look he gets when examining a rival's business card), the whole play he does on the character.  It looks like everyone gets what Ellis was doing with the book.  Everyone may hear about the notoriety of the book, but in the end American Psycho was the blackest of comedies, forcing the reader to try and laugh at moments that are interspersed with some of the most disturbing passages I've read in a long time.
The filmmakers do an incredible and difficult job of cutting the book down to filmable size.  It's a great job of picking scenes from the book for the screen, meanwhile leaving out entire sections and characters (Bethanie, his ex-girlfriend) but not compromising the whole thing.  This could be a 3 hour movie, instead it's under 100 minutes and feels just right.
Christian Bale is so commanding as Bateman that he gives a real face to the narrator of the book.  The film even keeps some of the violence, but watching those scenes from the book played off they take on a humerous tone that the black and white page was hiding well.  For instance, the murder of Al, the bum, becomes funny when Bateman starts saying those lines.  The film is not a comedy, it's a not horror movie, it's not a drama.  It's a very vicious satire that combines all of those elements and stays smart.
I don't see a more famous Hollywood or not-Hollywood director making this without compromising more of the book in favor of personal style.
Interesting to note: For some reason the UK region DVD (which you can't play over here) has 6 deleted scenes!  The American DVD has a number of nice extras, but why would they leave off the deleted scenes?  Sure, they're cutting room floor, but at least 2 of the scenes would have fit nicely into the film, and the other bits are funny as well.  ...
This is a highly recommended film for anyone with a little dark side, no matter how little.  It's funny and visually provoking enough for many people to fall in love with this small production and appreciate cruel satire and the blackest humor.",1047254400,,3425,4.504854368932039
70383,5,0783243499,"Pat Bateman is an intelligent, Harvard educated yuppie who has a sense for fasion and works on Wall Street. His life is centered around material things. He has to have the best of everything, and on many levels, he does. He tries his hardest to fit in, and in the most part, he succeeds. But in the back of his head, the sense of not being good enough in his high-class environment is eating away at him, and sends him into uncontrolable violent frenzies, that may or may not have just been dreamed up in his troubled brain, and never actually happened. Based on, and highly toned down from, Brett Easton Ellis' extremely graphic and controversial novel, American Psycho is a suspense/thriller that does not even come near the realm of subtlety (except when compared to the book). This film characterizes the lives of a pack of rich, young urban professionals (or Yuppies, if you rather), in a satirical way, but also does not make us forget that it is a suspense film. Their greed and disgust are their only emotions, but only seemingly more so in our protagonist. Some of the amusing little scenes (ex. Bateman and his friends bickering over who has the most tasteful business card) may just seem like interesting filler to the untrained eye, but when thought about deeply, makes you think about how mentally different these people are. If squeamish, I suggest you read the book first, to make the movie seem a little tamer. But if you want it more shocking and suspenseful, by all means, see the movie first.

70384,5,0783243499,"This may be THE American satirical work of the nineties, and has a special resonance following the ENRON and WORLDCOM sagas that ended that weird decade.  We do need to keep reminding ourselves that a film is a film not another version of a book.  More than anything, Ms Mary Harron must be given full credit for the work whilst acknowledging her source material.  She needs to be spoken of in the same way as Julie Taymor whose brilliant work on Titus Andronicus should bear comparison. But in terms of satire, which I believe is at the heart of the greatest comedy, only Mr Todd Solondz perhaps is a worthy contender.  I found the set pieces in AMERICAN PSYCHO superb, the acting pitch perfect, and the mis en scene a model of its kind.  As there is over 300 reviews preceding this, I keep my comments brief -I only hope that Ms Harron has the opportunity to direct much more.",1041465600,,878,4.4625

In the end, I watched most of this in fast-forward, hoping that something just a few minutes later into the movie would redeem it. Heck, not even the soundtrack helped, and I love 80s pop. Don't bother hitting ""pause"" when you go to the bathroom - you won't miss anything. The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die. Yea, I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. They're wet-paper thin. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end the apathy wins and it doesn't even matter that it's only a movie. Who cares?",1040083200,4,973,4.630057803468208
70387,5,0783243499,"When this movie came out in April of 2000, I didn't have any expectations. My friends and I were talking about this movie a couple months before it came out. We thought this was going to be the best movie since Stanley Kubricks A Clock Work Orange. With the title of this movie already disturbing, American Psycho guaranteed to horrify and disturb the audience; I couldn't wait to see it. I really enjoyed this movie because I am really into this genre of dark and twisted movies. It also showed us a person trying to find himself in the New York City society, and a great view of the eighties.
  The main characters are Christen Bale as Patrick Bateman, Reese Witherspoon as Evelyn Williams who is Patrick's fianc. The story is very hard to follow, abstract and extremely dark. The movie is about a good-looking pretty boy, Patrick Bateman, who has everything going for him with a great job, lots of cash, a hot girlfriend and even a hotter mistress. The only thing lacking in his world is any appearance of a soul. In his own words, he just ""doesn't exist"". Patrick has many hobbies: He loves music, going to clubs, charming the ladies, cocaine and of course killing, Mutilating and beating innocent people for the shear joy of watching them bleed. His lust for blood gets stronger and his sanity slowly slips away, that is what drives him to kill.
  I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish.  I really be keen on these weird twisted, dark movies because it keeps me entertained and usually laughing throughout the whole movie. This is one of the best horror movie I have seen in a while. I don't know why I am into these dark and twisted movies, I just am. I love the way they just bluntly show the gore and violence without masking it at all. The way they portrayed his life is perfect in everyway, to everyone's eyes but his own. Through his eyes, his life seems boring and nothing can excite him anymore, except to kill someone and then paint it. In his eyes, blood, gore and death are beautiful. This is why this movie gave great visuals to the dark and twisted part of it.
  This movie is based on true story of a man trying to find him self in the high-class New York City society. When he finds himself, he figures out that, to be in this society is absolutely boring. The only way to stay sane in his eyes is listen to great eighties music artist like Huey Lewis and the News and to kill people for no reason. In this society, people rate you on what you wear, where you can get reservations and how good your personal business card is. For example, the main character, Christen Bale brutally killed his co-worker just because he had a better business card then him. This movie puts you on a dark and twisted search trying to find who the ""real"" Patrick Bateman is.
  This movie also gives a great representation of life in the eighties and how money isn't everything but everybody thinks it is. In the eighties in New York City, it was all about where you ate, who you hung out with, and what drugs you did. Back then, the drug of choice was cocaine. In the eighties, cocaine ran ramped and you could purchase in almost any bar or restaurant. During this time, the crime rate skyrocketed and prostitution was big thing during this time. This movie gave great visuals of the eighties. It really focused on what people thought about each other. Everybody thought that money was very important, but people threw it away like old leftovers. This movie gave in depth examples of all these things.
  This movie is either a love it or hate it type of movie. You might get it or you might not. If you do get it you will go for a 2-hour roller coaster ride of horror, gore and little comedy.  This movie gave a great story of a man trying to find himself in the New York City society and when he did he didn't really care for it. This movie also gave a great description of the eighties in New York city.  In conclusion, I really enjoyed watching this movie and I still enjoy watching this movie. Over and over again.

For anyone remotely fascinated by the movie even if you are not an avid reader, the Bret Easton Ellis book will cut you to pieces - pardon the pun.

70393,4,0783243499,"Well, I was thinking that I would be getting a visual interpretation of the incredible novel that swept through America like an unwanted fire, plaque, or insect invasion. Only the _Village Voice_ recognized the book for the marvelous, fun-filled romp through insanity and the light-hearted nature of purchases and acquisitions in the business world.
I was also thinking that it would be fun to watch the kid who was just great in _Empire of the Sun_. Well, the little devil grew up and isn't allowed to fall into being typecast as a boy entering puberty in a Japanese concentration camp. We do, however, get to see what hell post-puberty can be when it is mixed with far too much salary for far too little work in New York.
You *must* read the book first: this is required because the only serious flaw in the film is its inability to clearly let you know what really happened as opposed to what the psycho thought happened or, worse, what he wanted to happen but didn't!
Unfortunately, for common decency, the ""best parts"" did not appear in the film. You are cheated out of seeing all sorts of things that would be better discussed in a teenage serial killer chat room over in Yahoo. Let's just say that one of many highlights in the book but not in the film involved the things one can do with a sharpa (not sure of the spelling, but it is that dog from China that has thousands of wrinkles) before and after its senseless death. Does dinner sound good about now?
The obsession with food is not clearly explained in the film: let's just say for common decency here that our lead character is a man of extraordinary tastes--tastes that make Hannibal Lector come across as Julia Child.
Finally, the film mistook satire for parody: far too many scenes are so off-the-wall that they come across as humor. On the other hand, more often than not, good satire causes introspection and an uneasiness about a situation. In this case, the uneasiness is the awful feeling that our society is creating monsters because of its insane worship of power and the obscene display of wealth.",1034553600,,2074,4.638586956521739

On the outside they exude confidence, style, and success, and they know exactly what to say and when to say it.  But on the inside lurks a fragmented soul ready to snap at any given moment.  Welsh actor Christian Bale, in one of the best performances you will ever see, brings to life Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who works at Pierce & Pierce by day and is a serial killer by night.  In adapting the controversial and unpleasant book by Bret Easton Ellis, director Mary Harron purges much of the violence and misogyny that made the novel one of the most despised and misunderstood pieces of literature in the last 20 years.  What remains is the book's twisted sense of humor.  This isn't a slasher film but rather a clever satire on the yuppie lifestyle of the late 1980s.  Speaking in a pitch-perfect American accent that recalls a game-show host, Bale perfectly embodies his character physically and emotionally.  His performance makes you simultaneously laugh at, pity, and fear Bateman.  Jared Leto is also good in his brief role as Paul Allen (in the book it's Paul Owen; why his name is changed in the film, I don't know); Chlo Sevigny also stands out as Patrick's timid assistant, and Reese Witherspoon shines as his clueless and self-absorbed fiancee.  This is the unedited version, which has a few additional flashes of nudity in one of the sex scenes.  The difference is so minimal, you'd hardly notice it, showing how uptight the MPAA can get when it comes to editing films.  Nonetheless, ""American Psycho"" is a disturbing but clever film that was one of the best of 2000.  It comes highly recommended.",1033171200,76,1714,4.7114093959731544

I felt the movie was overrated first, because of all the talk of violence when the film was released, and secondly because all the glowing user reviews.
Since so many people do seem to like it, I would rate it a rent before deciding to own.  This has been a review of the unrated version.",1031356800,2,595,4.711538461538462

Poor, disillusioned Patrick just needs to buy a house in the country, marry-up Reese, and lay down the law about being true to her man. And follow that advice himself by being loyal in return. Man, I'd be set! I mean, he'd be set. Anyways, where was I? Ah, American Psycho. Nothing short of mesmerizing. Patrick Bateman (our old friend, Christian Bale, from two personal favorites of mine, Newsies and Little Women) is a yuppie in the mid 1980's, extremely rich, and extremely messed up. He feels that ""Patrick Bateman"" isn't a real person, just an idea, a mask he wears. This is probably partly due to the fact that all the yuppies he works and plays with are so much alike, and so self-absorbed, that they can't even keep each other's names straight. Maybe that's what angers him so much that all he really thinks about is killing, dismembering, and even eating his victims. Oh, and '80's music, he's big on '80's music. You know, Phil Collins, Huey Lewis, the best of the '80's at least. As a matter of fact, he loves playing '80's CD's and talking about '80's music trivia as he performs his executions and murders. This is not altogether unnecessary, as it does help to lighten the mood during the violent scenes.
 Basically, the film takes us through a particularly difficult time in Patrick's life, when his obsession with killing begins to interfere with his facade of just another young hot shot business man. Competition is the way of life in Patrick's world, and he's beginning to feel the urge to use his hobby in the workplace as an effective tool of business. To put it simply, Patrick is losing control. The pressures at work, his frustration with his Yuppie girlfriend (Witherspoon), his hatred of his friends, and the inquisitions from a certain Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe), are causing him to be careless and deadly. Simultaneously, he is having to deal with the tiny bit of natural sympathy that still exists within him, mainly for his innocent and naive young secretary who has a serious crush on him. Things keep getting worse and worse for Patrick, so much that he somehow becomes the hero of the picture. No doubt, despite the fact that he's obviously nuts, he really becomes a very sympathetic and likeable character. I'm guessing that this is because everyone else in the film is just such a jerk. Of course, this disturbing feeling of sympathy for a psycho was purely intentional by the filmmakers, but it's fascinating nonetheless. The climax of the film is even more disturbing, and the resolution, downright confusing, but in a fantastic way. American Psycho is one of the best movies out there right now. Definitely a must see film, if not a must own.",1031184000,,2731,4.7494736842105265
70408,5,0783243499,"I started reading through the reviews of this movie, and over and over, I had to click on ""No,"" this review was not ""helpful"" to me, whether the person gave it one star or five stars. After reading about 20 of them, I was beginning to think that either everyone watching it just isn't getting it or I'm as whacked out as Patrick Bateman. My take on this movie seems to be completely different from everyone else's (although I didn't read all 300 reviews: maybe someone in here has my take on it).
First let me state my perspective. Judged by how many times I've watched it (about 10 times), this must be one of my favorite movies. I don't seem to be able to get enough of it, and my interpretation of it has evolved from bemused bafflement to a satisfied feeling that I really get it. Second, I did not read the book, and based on what I've read in these reviews, I'm glad I didn't, because I've been able to contemplate this movie without trying to relate it to the book, to contemplate it as an independent work of art that plays with the viewer's mind and challenges the viewer to figure this Patrick Bateman out. Those people responsible for it may have had some ideas triggered by the book, but this movie can stand on its own considerable merits.
Unlike some reviewers, I am not in the least attracted by the character of Patrick Bateman. I find him completely contemptible and repulsive, and to allude to a line from the movie, I have nothing in common with him. Yet he is fascinating to watch and I can't help laughing hysterically at his total emptiness and delusions.
Delusions bring up the point I want to make about this movie. At one level it is impossible to tell what is real and what is sheer delusion in Patrick Bateman's mind. What is really happening, and what is being imagined or dreamed by Patrick? Maybe he did kill a few people in this movie. But I can't tell whether he really did killed Paul Allen or whether this was merely one of his delusional fantasies. The movie surely gives enough examples of psychotic delusions on his part. Some of the things he says directly to women obviously were not actually said, because if they were, the women would have called for the bouncer to have him thrown out. As it was, they just ignore him. Some of the murders were utterly preposterous, as when he carefully aims the running chainsaw at the prostitute fleeing down the stairs and he throws it at her, stabbing her in the back when she is four flights of stairs below him. Come on! That never happened, even in the movie! Then the killing spree at the end OBVIOUSLY never happened! When he had the shootout with the cops, he takes a couple shots at them, never missing his human target from 100 yards away (do you know how hard that is?), and suddenly one of his bullets causes all the cop cars aligned against him to explode! Even HE is surprised, suddenly staring at his gun in disbelief that he could have done that with a single shot. This was such a string of carnage that it would have been all over the news and all the talk. Yet no one says a word about it when he meets with his associates the next day.
When he revisits the apartment where he had dead bodies hanging in every closet, the place is pristine and is for sale. There's not a word from anyone that an apartment was found full of mutilated bodies. Why? Obviously, because it was all in his imagination! After he breaks down and confesses to his lawyer that he just went on a killing spree, he lawyer laughs because it is so preposterous. Such a thing would have made the headlines, yet the lawyer thinks it's just a sick joke, and he saw Paul Allen in London the day Patrick was supposed to have killed him.
Yet there is ambiguity even here. All these Wall Street stockbrokers (every one of them younger than 30 and vice-presidents whose greatest status symbols are the classiness of their business cards and where they can get dinner reservations), all of them look and act alike and they are constantly misidentifying each other. Was it really Paul Allen he killed (if he killed one of his associates at all), was it really Paul Allen the lawyer saw in London? It is impossible to say, which is one of the most amusing ironies of this eternally entertaining movie.",1030579200,5,4256,4.443734015345268

70412,5,0783243499,"In American Psycho, novelist Bret Easton Ellis starts brilliantly satirizing life duing the 1980's, focusing on the culturally bankrupt lifestyle of Wall Street investment bankers and their bretheren.  Ellis depicts a shallow world populated by yuppies obsessed with status symbols: clothing, the right job, getting in the right restaurants, etc. Ellis is clearly in-tune with the cultural ""ins"" and ""outs"" of the era, providing an accurate time capsule for readers.  Within this world, these yuppies fail to notice that one of their own, Patrick Bateman, is consummed by an ever-growing compulsion to kill, especially those people that disturb his worldview.
Writer/director Mary Harron tackled the difficult task of adapting the book for the silver screen.  Appropriately, her movie adaptation focuses in on the satirical elements.  Actor  Christian Bale (also appears in Shaft in a somewhat similar role) deserves much of the credit for bringing the movie to life with his outstanding performance as Patrick Bateman.  Through his performance, you can easily understand Bateman's deep underlying psychosis and the on-going conflict in his mind as he tries to control that bloodlust.  All this is done with a pitch-black sense of humor.  Fortunately, the movie skips the book's more disturbing and disappointing elements.  Ellis' novel rapidly disintegrates from its promising beginnings rooted in satire.  I found that Ellis' novel increasingly focused on the violence, increasingly elaborate and disturbing.  Although I think the graphic violence is highly effective in conveying Bateman's ever-slipping grasp on reality, it makes the book unreadable for most and is the source of much of the negative criticism.  Credit Harron for keeping the violence off-screen, and the absurdity of the violence renders it almost cartoon-like.  That being said some viewers still will not be able to stomach it.
The movie's ending is essentially true to the book and very fitting.
As for the DVD itself, it is disappointing in its failure to take advantage of the medium.  A commentary for a controversial movie like this would have been extremely interesting.",1024012800,,2150,5.45619335347432

Patrick Bateman's indifference to the mayhem and violence he inflicts is far more brutal and shocking than the acts themselves, yet in equal amounts, it's extremely funny. The film can be enjoyed the 50th time as much as the first unlike many psychological movies. I liken it to Taxi Driver where society had become so unconnected that killing other fellow humans has no meaning.

From the beginning of the film, you become immediately drawn to this guy, he is strangely likeable, despite his many excesses (including of course, murder).  And the greed, lust and eccenticity of the Reagan 80's are well represented here, in hilarious form.
The highlights of which are the Business Card scene, Bateman's musical critiques, his being ""on the verge of tears"" because he was sure that he would not have a good table while entering a restaurant w/ his fiance, and of course...the murder of Paul Allen....I could go on and on.

In the end, the viewer discovers that none of the murders were even real, merely figments of a warped imagination.
It is, however, a mildly amusing movie, has some excellent photography, and Christian Bale does an ok job portraying the main character. But, like the vapid and soulless lifestyle it purports to criticize, American Psycho dances around the same tired and superficial images, content with just looking stylish without tackling anything substantial. It is a frustrating movie because it so desparately wants to be a biting satire, a work of art, and comes pretty close in a few scenes.

70429,4,0783243499,"American Psycho is the long delayed film version of the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. When it was published nearly ten years ago, it was met with a storm of controversy. Its quite graphic violence caused critics to overlook the book's central theme, which is that a society awash in materialism will lose its collective soul. As the main character puts it, ""The only true emotions I feel are disgust and greed."" Originally, Oliver Stone wanted to film it using Leonardo DiCaprio as the protagonist, Patrick Bateman. I can see Leo D. in the part, but I imagine Stone would have made a very violent and very loud mess of it. Finally, the project was placed in the hands of director Mary Harron, and she wisely chose to emphasis the book's satirical and comedic elements over its violence. The result is a movie that is about as good a filming of the novel as one could hope for. Whether or not it is also entertainment depends on each viewer's tastes.
Christian Bale gives the performance of his life as Patrick Bateman. Patrick is a young man who is the epitome of a soulless success. Wickedly bright and utterly ruthless, he makes big bucks working at a high powered finanical concern in New York. He works out religiously. He is fanatical about his appearance, and his morning routine of getting himself cleaned up, made up and dressed for work would put any movie star to shame. His wardrobe is impeccable. His haircut is perfect. Even his business cards are designed to be the best. Any coworker who dresses better or looks better than Patrick is considered to be competition and, thus, one of the enemy. His carefully contrived personal appearance goes far beyond the masks we knew in the past. It is more of a tool than his words or his actions. It is also a trap and a weapon. Yet most of the people Patrick knows seem to be using the same weapon, while Patrick is the only one who knows that behind the facade there is usually only emptiness. In this pursuit of meaningless physical and material perfection, he has also gone stark raving mad. He finally snaps. One evening he takes Paul Allen [Jared Leto], his fiercest competitor, out to dinner and then to his apartment, where he coldly and calculatedly kills him with an ax. When the police question him about the missing Allen, he coolly throws them off the track. At the same time, as his madness takes complete control, he goes on a murderous rampage.
American Psycho is not a slasher flick nor is a thriller. It is a satirical black comedy that makes a valid attempt to show the ultimate futility of a relatively small but influential segment of American society. It does not always succeed, especially towards the end, because the violence ultimately becomes too numbing. This fact does not prevent it from being one of 2000's more original movies, and it does nothing to overshadow the enormous talents of its star and its director.",1016409600,,2896,4.658203125
70430,4,0783243499,"I was stunned to see WHO played Patrick Bateman in this movie.  One of my favorite films of all time, ""Empire of the Sun"" (see my review if interested) starred a fourteen-year old Christian Bale with a heavy English accent.  What happened!?  He's all grown-up, hunky, and quite the convincing actor (even the accent is gone!).  I thought this movie was good.  As I have stated in another review, this book was banned in places accessible to me during my high school years.  I eventually read the book to discover that it was quite a work of art, often reminiscent of ""Clockwork Orange"".  The movie adaptation is well-done, even though it left out much of the gore of the printed edition.

 The story takes place amidst the decadence and hairspray atmosphere of the 80's.  Patrick Bateman(Bale) and his friends are obsessed with women, money, great restaurant reservations, and themselves.  Patrick's whole existence is identified to us by his lifestyle.  He is obsessed about everything from his skin care line to his business cards. He is perfect and seemingly normal to his peers.  However, this hunky, wealthy, ""perfect"" guy has a big secret: When this Wall Street yuppie is not trying to get into ""Dorsia"",  NYC's finest restaurant, he's an insane serial killer.  Patrick lives two lives that have only one thing in common...his obsession for cleanliness and perfection. Is he truly insane, or are we all?  It's a rough question to ask yourself while peeking into his behaviors through night and day.
The ending leaves us a bit confused. It seemed rushed.  I can't give it away, but it leaves some questions to toss around for hours after finishing the movie.  I thought performances by Reese Witherspoone (""Legally Blonde"") and Chloe Soveigny (""Boys Don't Cry"") were well done. In all, this is a great film to rent. I won't recommend purchase. I think the extreme gore would probably, in my opinion be a little tiring after a while, but I must say, I couldn't get enough of Patrick Bateman's constant sarcasm.  He has some lines that are so laughable, you sometimes forget this is a Drama/Suspense or Horror in most video stores.  While not a perfect ""date movie"" (my own sarcastic attempt), ""American Psycho"" is sure to please if you have a good sense of humor.  I can't wait to see what movies Christian Bale will choose in the future.  He has done well painting the tale of a psychopath with excellent taste in food and ties.",1015200000,,2433,4.784172661870503
70431,4,0783243499,"Considering how wrong any adaptation of Ellis' notorious book could have gone, Mary Harmon has fashioned a rompin'-stompin' good film, and was smart and fortunate enough to cast Christian Bale in the lead. Tongue-in-cheek production design and music supervision add to the vicious lunacy exploding from almost every frame. Of course, no one could have expected less from her after ""I Shot Andy Warhol,"" another great time at the movies that tossed darts at a bygone era.
The film will have most appeal to folks who had to suffer these monstrous urban characters in the 80s and 90s - foul yuppies with little more than status and oneupmanship on their festering minds - so the biting satire will be lost on its targets who, likely, continue to live in abject denial of their past tawdriness.
The ""business card scene"" rates as classic, the over-the-top chainsaw chase comes close, and Bale swooning over the cultural contributions of Whitney Houston and Phil Collins as he hacks his way through the mediocrity of his own mind is just delicious.
One just wishes Lions Gate had not gone for the jugular with its tacky cover art. It's like pasting a Golan-Globus Cannon Films sensibility on top of an art film in order to hawk it to the Great Mass it sees as proles.

Much like the 1980's -- the decade in which the story takes place.
A big ""thank you"" to the production team on this movie for not making it the bloodbath it might have been.  I was never a fan of Brett Easton Ellis but when he published the novel on which this film is based, I knew he was a rank amateur and that little more than luck had fueled his career.  His use of extreme violence was only a means to get attention for an otherwise paltry manuscript.  No -- or very minimal -- artistry involved.
I've heard that the director of this film wanted to rescue the story.  And she did a wonderful job.  This isn't the first time this has happened in film.  In fact, compare another very famous film -- Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" -- to the novel by Robert Bloch on which it was based and you can immediately see a parallel.  Even bad novels may contain the seed of a great idea.  And we are lucky sometimes to have movie directors capable of reworking them and creating art.
The actor, Christian Bale, is phenomenal in this movie.  I had never seen him before but I will be looking for him in other roles.  Here he plays the title character perfectly.  I can't think of anyone better to play Patrick Bateman.
The rest of the cast is excellent.  And I am once again pleased to see the beautiful Chloe Sevigny.  Unfortunately, she is not in many of the film's scenes.  But when she is, wow!
So, I wish this movie had ended more satisfactorilly, but I understand what the director was trying to do.  The eighties were about style more than substance.  And while this movie has both, in the end, substance loses.",1014508800,5,1709,4.446945337620579

It's really less about a psycho killer as it is satirical look at the ""yuppie lifestyle"" of the 1980's. As far as actual violence, the movie is way toned down compared to the book.
I think the category it best fits into would be a dark comedy. The more you see it, the more you notice every nuance of every character, with Christian Bale's portrail of Patrick Bateman being the undisputed masterpiece of the film. He brings a witty and amusing, yet still scary edge to Bateman. This is one of the best performances I have seen by an actor in a movie.
This is definitely a must-see.",1014163200,,696,4.28030303030303
70434,4,0783243499,"This adaptation of the gritty bestseller is a real find.  In it we have Christian Bale as `psycho' of the title Patrick Bateman, spurred into action through a boring 80's lifestyle of business and appearances.  By focusing on middle-class society's little nuances, this movie manages to show just how complacent society has become, with Bale's lifestyle of a perfectly astute businessman masking his other life as a murderer who hires prostitutes up to his trendy flat.
The performances are all good but it is Bale who impresses the most as he calmly murders a colleague yet becomes pent-up with rage when someone has a more expensive-looking business card than his own.  The audience sits back and watches as the beautiful ensemble cast (including Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon and Jared Leto) are lured or skewered by Bateman.  This is black comedy at its very blackest, forcing its audience into nervous titters as Bateman moonwalks behind one of his victims, wielding an axe, or prepares for a murder whilst listening to Whitney Houston.
It's not only a darkly humorous piece but it also says a lot about society today, despite being set two decades ago.  Moreover it's a definite improvement on the book, toning down the violence to make it a lot more comic and a little less horrific but not to the extent that the message doesn't come across loud and clear.",1013990400,,1367,4.9004329004329

Nothing is more intentionally perverse than the scenes in which the protagonist soliloquizes about his favorite music-- horrible, commercial stuff like Whitney Houston, Robert Palmer, and Huey Lewis-- I guess as a comment on the shallowness of the 80's commercial culture Ellis was satirizing.  That scene where he calls ""The greatest love of all"" one of the most beautiful songs ever written completely without irony...well, there's more to this movie that will turn your stomach.

Some people's reviews have given this film a low rating because 'the film doesn't give them any deep spiritual enlightenment' or 'There's nothing here that an intelligent person who has barely scrutinised the 80s can't get, and there's no reason to sit through almost two hours of tripe to get to it'. Lighten up, it's a film, it is meant to be entertainment not a social economics lecture. I would file this DVD between Fight Club and Phil Collins Live.

Having pointed out where the movie falls short of the book, allow me to say that the movie is a pretty faithful reproduction of roughly 1/3 of the book.  If you read it first, you'll catch lines, see scenes, remember things from it -- but you'll feel disappointed at the ending.
You cannot, in modern market requirements, make a film that would accurately capture the entire book.  Fair enough.  This 1/3 of the book in film isn't terrible.

70440,3,0783243499,"Now that I am over the shock of this films ending, I guess that I will write my review.
This film was one of the most complicated films that I have ever seen. The whole thing was just bizarre. It was totally and utterly violent and disturbing. On the other hand, certain scenes were hilarious. Christian Bale gives a great portrayal of Patrick Bateman, a self absorbed nut who ticks off about the littlest things. He targets women when he gets really angry about things, and sometimes takes his anger on certain gentleman in his office. When things don't go his way or situations get too stressful for him, something inside him sparks, and he has to kill. Meanwhile, his relationship with his ditzy girlfriend is on the rocks, and her airhead friends constantly surround him. Life sucks for this doofus.
The other performances were equally effective. Reese Witherspoon plays Patrick's girlfriend, and she is perfect for the role. The musical score has hints of Bernard Herrmann's ""Psycho"" score, which fits in this film perfectly.
However, this film is very graphic and unnerving, and I don't know if I would recommend it or not; also, the ending was... well...never mind.
This one is definitely not for kids.",1008115200,,1209,4.845410628019324
70441,1,0783243499,"Now let me start by saying, if I could have given this ""film"" a zero, I would have.  Unfortunatly that is not possible.
This is by far, the worst film I have seen this year.  Mary Harron was trying way to hard and it shows.  The movie has very little substance to it, and people seem to be fond of attaching vague statements to their reviews like ""brillant satire"" and ""amazing mind games.""  None of these terms can rescue this movie however, as it is a feeble attempt at art, a meaningless and shallow depiction of rich white business men in the 1980's, and a totally unconvincing portrait of a serial killer.
As far as the acting in this film I was not impressed with Christian Bales protrait of a man with no conscience.  The dialogue was to ""clever"" to be believable, or even stomachable.  Bale's voice over's are painful and irritating to listen to.
What upsets me most about this film, is not the film itself but the tendency for people to compare it to either Clockwork Orange or Fight Club.  American Pyscho does not begin to compare to either film, although their were some shots(most notably towards the end) that seemed to emulate Kubricks style, but they do no justice to the late genius.  As far as comparing it to Fight Club, the narrative style, and structure of the two films are vaguely similar, although Fight Club is on an entirely different level.
All in all, American Pyscho will fade into oblivion within the next few years.  There is absolutely no good reason to watch this movie as you will gain nothing from it.  I apologize for being a little vague in this review myself, but I was so dissappointed in the film, that a second viewing is simply out of the question.",1007856000,6,1690,4.511475409836065

There, now thats out of the way I may begin. This is a satirical look at life in the late Eightys in greedy New York, a group of young, rich and bored men and women live there lives on a cocktail of expensive restaurants, clubs and drugs. Howerver all is not well and good within Patrick Bateman(Cristian Bale)he has developed a intense bloodlust through bordem he gets nasty with often shocking but occasionally humourous results.
My advice : BUY IT AND WATCH IT TWICE",1006387200,,486,4.597701149425287
70443,4,0783243499,"Despite its title and a considerable amount of bloodshed, &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; is a superbly witty and satirical film. The film is ostensibly about a serial murderer who happens to be fabulously wealthy, handsome, fit, and successful, but it is really a sarcastic critique of the money culture that defined the nineteen eighties.
Patrick Bateman is a twenty-seven year old CEO who lives in the late 1980s and spends his leisure time in exclusive restaurants and clubs with his peers. He has occasional love affairs so meaningless that he can't be troubled to remove his trousers during epidermal frictional activity, and of course, he kills people. Bateman is an odd bird who is obsessed with the comparative quality of business cards and who possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of contemporary (i.e. 1980s) music.
Bateman's homicidal impulses are frequently governed by his intense hatred of the superficial world around him. (spoiler).
The message of this film is that in the yuppie culture of the late eighties, even if you were a self-confessing murderer, people would not be able to see you for who you were. In a sense, Bateman, the murderer, is like other extreme characters in literature such as Werther, Pechorin, and Merseault. Like his literary predecessors, Bateman is alienated by the superficial society around him and is driven to extreme forms of reaction against it. In a notable scene, Bateman brings two call girls to his apartment and commands them to debase themselves in front of him. Later, as he thrusts his tube steak in and out of their love pockets he makes ridiculous posses in front of a mirror, essentially laughing at himself.
To its credit, &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; is not a clinical or horrorific film. While serial killing is certainly a grizzly subject, it is a more a device and a motif than a theme in this movie. Much of the killing is performed off camera. What homicide we do see is stylized to the point of being ridiculous. In a wonderful way, the film goes out of its way to assure us that its concerned with satire, and a social critique not with simulating brutality.",1004486400,,2126,4.974719101123595
70444,4,0783243499,"Christian Bale plays a yuppie on wall street with some serious mental issues. The attitude of the movie is sarcastic and mostly humorous. The actors do a good job of following the look and feel of the movie- everything is a little corny.
Patrick Bateman (Bale) has only a few emotions. Two are greed and disgust, and the third is an uncontrollable urge to kill, which is his only escape from a dull and dreary life.
Due to the many complaints about this movie, I will state the obvious: this movie has a lot of killing in it. The presence of the word ""psycho"" would tip most people off, but just in case it's not for squeemish folks. But even being squeemish won't ruin it, as there is very little visible violence. In most cases, the victims are not shown much during the attack. It's about as tastefull as you can get when it comes to killing people. The most graphic displays are Bateman's pencil sketches.
The movie contains elements of satire, but the personalities of his friends were chosen to provide Bateman's personality a suitable environment, filled with others that don't find his outward displays of greed and concietedness odd. The movie may contain a lot of poking around, but the focus is definitely on the psychological aspect of Bateman- the ridiculous decade takes the back seat.
That brings us to the intellectual aspect of it. You could watch the movie without really paying attention to what happens, and just laugh at goofy scenes and yuppies. But one only has to listen to the dialog at the end to get the main idea.
For the benefit of those that don't get it (in order to preserve the surprise, I will leave one part explained), in the beginning Bateman kills out of boredom and addictive impulse. Only after his great frustration with the jarring issue at the end does he become frustrated with hopelessness and truly sadistic. He then suggests he will kill for the actual satisfaction of watching others suffer to make up for his own mental pain (a big difference when it comes to the rehabilitation issue, which is not addressed). This is all spelled out in the movie, with the exception of transferring vengeance to murder, but by that time we can hardly reason to doubt his inclusion of murder as an option. Since the mood of most of the movie tends to put you in a watch-only mode, I can see how some people might need to watch the last couple minutes over again, as the resolution is 99% dialog.
A few corrections to common comments. First, there are no real cries for help. Bateman reveals himself to drunk/drugged people for his own amusement (one of which he is already carrying out his plan to kill). His only serious confession is near the end, and becomes necessary for the plot, so there is no reason to believe the movie is about the armchair psychology of ""cries for help."" Second, the is no men/women sexism, or at least no preference. The men are selfish pigs, the women are too emotional, and both are equally promiscuous. They're all scum. Also, there are almost no similarities to Fight Club. Sure, the main characters are both nuts (though they have completely different disorders), and there is violence in it. Not much of a match. I find two real connections myself. One being that both movies require the viewer to be light hearted and not too emotional about violence (which leads to emotional types to classify them as both too violent, and thus the same). The other is that unobservant critics make the same mistake about both: they fail to comprehend that the main characters are crazy (and therefore the films purpose is not to promote whatever they do) and try to draw cliche statements about society as the theme.
Finally, if you are the type that needs to have a hero in every movie, this is not for you. Much like the Mel Gibson flick ""Payback,"" the movie is full of unscrupulous characters, including the protagonist. To really enjoy the movie, you have to laugh at ridiculous and trite murder.",1004054400,,3955,4.651428571428571

Bale portrays Patrick Bateman, a sterotypical 1980's corporate yuppie, who suffers through each business day pretending to be someone he is NOT!  As you watch Bale move through the movie, it is obvious he is one of the great acting talents of today.  He scares the hell out of you as the apparent corporate vice president by day, psycho serial killer by night.  Oh, but IS he?  What a contrasting transformation Bale makes from his role in the wonderful movie ""Little Women"" as the suffering and love struck wanna be beau of ""Jo"".  The second time I watched this film, I was left with the conclusion that the character of Patrick Bateman was not a serial killer at all, but a repressed business man venting his fantasies through the course of the film.  I reached this conclusion because his victims seemed to mysteriously disappear when he'd go back to get rid of the body, or were spotted by other corporate suits while traveling abroad.  Bateman's reaction to these ""spottings"" of his victims and the real estate agent's denial of any bodies lends some sense to my theory.  I love Reese Witherspoon, but she was miscast as Bateman's boring fiance, and Samantha Mathis' role as Bateman's lover wasn't much more exciting.  The movie has it's moments, though, and several times I caught myself sitting up straight and paying attention!  I will probably get emails telling me I am completely wrong, but believing Bateman's murdering and mayhem is only supposed to be in his mind made the movie more credible and believable to me.  It is DEFINITELY a ""keeper"" for the home theater library.  I bought the uncut version.  A campy, scary, funny film!",1000425600,3,1836,4.768987341772152

70458,4,0783243499,"I have just watched this film for the second time, and have finally come to some real conclusions about it. I have also read the novel, by Ellis. First let me say that the film is both a brilliant adaptation of the novel as well as being only a pale shadow of it. The adaptation was brilliant in that it adapted the most significant parts of the novel in terms of theme, rather than turning the film into a gore fest. Yes, this film is about a serial killer, but it is also about alienation and emptiness and the utter despair of having everything but having nothing worthwhile. I think that often the real meaning of the book and the film go unnoticed. Yes, it is a brilliant film in terms of cinematography and plot, but what does it all mean? Patrick Bateman, our protagonist, says at the beginning that he does not really exist, and throughout the film he is always mistaken for someone else. I think this film has a great deal to say about alienation, about the emptiness of modern life. It really has the same theme as Fight Club, though that theme is represented differently. But that theme still comes through very strongly: that modern society has lost touch with reality, that it is estranged and unfocused, and that people need something more than lots of money, high rise apartments and perfect bodies. Bateman becomes a killer because he needs to feel something just as the guys in Fight Club initiated fights in order to really feel, to feel that they were alive. I think that American Psycho is more a general comment on society than it is on serial killers. But it stands as an important commentary, a very valuable film. I would have given it a full five stars, but the fact is that the film is not for everyone.
And, if you have any doubts, just seeing Christian Bale's performance is worth the entire film. Why he didn't get the Oscar is beyond my understanding. This is one of the greatest performances on film I have ever seen.",999993600,,1948,4.490140845070423
70459,5,0783243499,"Simply put, American Psycho is one of the greatest mind games ever put on film.  The venture into the mind has been been exploited by many dramas but never in such a thought-provoking, interactive manner.  Using setting and time, the director puts the viewer in the movie as a conscience for the havoc-wreaking Patrick Bateman.  What we have to figure out is which of the lead characters rage-driven atrocities really happen and which are just the imaginations of an emotionally isolated businessman.  As modern Americans, all of us have had desires to put a snbby bartender in her place, snub a homeless man for not trying hard enough, or in extreme cases, even kill those in our workplace.  Now understandibly, we have the self-restraint to quell these urges, but who hasn't envisioned an endgame for those who torment us?  The beauty of this film is in the mystery.  Is the star a true maniac or is he just so into himself that his delusions of murder are manifested only in the imagination?  That is for you to figure out. Christian Bale puts in a stellar performance as the delusional madman.  Most remarkable are his soliloquies praising the most banal of 1980's pop bands.  ""Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?""  should go down as one of filmdoms most loaded questions.  Director Mary Harron uses a number of different styles to accomplish her interpretation, tapping the slasher films of the 70's and 80's to the Wall Street-esque dialogue.  Harron has created enough scenes that stand alone in their brilliance while infusing a storyline that leaves no lack of watchability.

After seeing the film version on the advice of a trusted friend, I can only say I'm still right about (A), but I was totally wrong about (B).  Mary Harron has done what I thought impossible- she has not only filmed ""American Psycho"", she has made it a much better story than it ever was in print.  Her basic technique is diabolically simple; her script demolishes the line between what protagonist Patrick Bateman actually does and what he fantasises doing.  Right from the start- in a witty title sequence that demonstrates that what you believe you're seeing is not necessarily what you think it is- Harron deliberately makes it unclear if Bateman's murders and rampages are real or in his head.  By film's end, the only thing that's clear is that Bateman could have done absolutely everything shown- or none of it- or some of it.  Chillingly, Bateman eventually realises he's so far gone that he himself does not know where the truth lies.  Not content to show Bateman as a psychopath, Harron mercilessly depicts the insanity of 1980's trendy New Yorkers.  Bateman is constantly telling people about the horrible acts he commits, or would like to, and no one listens.  Half the time Bateman is mistaken for someone else by people just too busy and self-centered to commit the simple, human act of caring enough to learn another person's name.  Is it any wonder he's the sickest of all possible puppies?
Harron also strengthens the story by considerably restricting the levels of violence and misogyny that infest the book.  There are a few stretches that look extremely gory, but as with the shower scene in ""Psycho"", more is implied than shown.
""American Psycho"" benefits from a first-rate cast.  As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale is spot on the money as a preppie-turned-yuppie-turned-madman.  Reese Witherspoon is great as his fiancee who never realises who her man is, let alone WHAT her man is.  Chloe Sevigny does some very deft work as Bateman's secretary; the scene where she's invited to Bateman's apartment to be murdered- only to create a misunderstanding that saves her life- is a comic gem.  And there is a poignant turn by Cara Seymour as Christie, a hooker who meets a terrible fate.  Seymour has a remarkable likeness to Louise Brooks, and something of the same manner.  We will see more of her in years to come, I think.  Willem Dafoe is a treat as a detective who may or may not be on to Bateman- and, come to think of it, may or may not be real.
See ""American Psycho"".  Even if you hated the book, SEE IT.  It's a movie that has the intelligence to refrain from spelling everything out in TV-Movie-Of-The-Week fashion, and that alone should be recommendation enough.  The fact that this film is stylish, witty, macabre, sexy and terrifying by turns is icing on a cake that could have been baked by Alfred Hitchcock- and I do not say that lightly.",998265600,3,3046,4.752851711026616
70461,5,0783243499,"With its extra five minutes, the film gets a completely different meaning. From a simple vision of the yuppy who is psychotic and kills to get his kicks in the financial world and goes through with it because he is a yuppy, it becomes the description of his psychosis and we do not know at the end if he has really killed or only imagined the killings. We are a lot more led into thinking that it is all a bad dream, a nightmare, a psychotic hallucination. It thus becomes the third panel of a tryptic. The American Dream first, which has to do with the dream of people arriving in the US and succeeding in making fortunes, or at least enough money to become the middle or upper middle class : the opera of American success and capitalism in its positive understanding. The American Nightmare then, which shows how those who do not succeed in making that first trip into wealth, fame and power, are led into killing, crime, at times sordid crime. These are the losers and they can only survive in this wolfish society as wolves and criminals. Capitalism leads to crime, either petty crime for the poor losers or organized crime for the more ambitious. The American psychosis is the third element, with crime developing in the mind of a successful subject in order to fuel his success. It is the story of the Golden Boys, of the Yuppies who have to be so ruthless with others in order to dominate and have the upper hand in the financial field that they develop, inside themselves, a completely murderous psychology. The only missing element is the urban paranoia that Stephen King explores in, his books, i.e. the fear of standard average Americans that their neighbors be enemies of the system, hence of them, and try to take over the system and make them slaves to their outlandish, extraterrestrial, revolutionary, dictatorial, funtamentalistic, dogmatic or sectarian objectives aiming at seizing power and then retaining it.
This American Psycho is absolutely essential to understand modern America. It is very well connected with the period (the 80s) and President Ronald Reagan, with his speech on the Irangate were he explains that this crime of money, warfare, power and politics is a good thing after all because it reassesses and reasserts the power of America within and without the US. Crime leads to power, and power requires crime, even if it does not justify it, and even if it does not have to be justified, except with the positive result of making America stronger in the world.
A great film for advanced viewers who are able to go beyond the surface of things.

The plot puts a sophisticated Bateman in a high paying Wall Street job surrounded by a bunch of stuck up ""too good for you"" Harvard educated pricks much like himself.  The only difference is Bateman's dark side that nobody knows about.  This is not one of those hack and slash movies that show blood for the sake of blood.  The fact is that there is almost no gore.  Don't get me wrong, I like blood as much as the next sicko, but it needs to be done in a clever way.  I found myself glued to the TV listening attentively to this perverted psycho's dialog.  Everything he does is so nonchalant which is what attracted me so much to this movie.  Having never heard anything about it, this movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise.

70464,4,0783243499,"I usually pride myself on being able to understand a movie absolutely with one viewing.  I'm a former English Literature major and I simply assumed that I had developed my ability to pick up on all the standard movie conventions to a relatively sophisticated level.  But this film totally confused me.  After my first viewing I thought it was needlessly violent and over the top with no purpose.  But even though my initial reaction was negative, the images of the movie stayed with me and it was only after about a six month gestation period of sub-conscious reflection that I realized what the film was actually trying to accomplish.  I watched it again and realized to my untter astonishment that American Psycho is a witty, piercing satire, sometimes hilarious, sometimes terrifying, and always brilliant.  The best way to describe the movie is ""Fight Club"" with no pulled punches.  I am one of many that felt ""Fight Club"" was brilliant and I still consider it a slightly more rewarding movie than Psycho, but Psycho covers ground even ""Fight Club"" shied away from, it is disturbing, but nonetheless, it needed to be said.  The problem with Psycho, and what makes the satire so difficult to percieve, is that there are virtually no hints that the opposite of every presented scene is actually meant.  The movie is a criticism of our materialist culture, everybody is ultra-refined and meticulously groomed to the point where they look like they've just stepped off the front cover of a magazine and because they all look so similar (in one of the subtle humourous conventions that indicates the movie is a satire) nobody can keep anybody else's identy straight.  This misidentification allows Patrick Bateman (Played wonderfully by Christian Bale) to plan a series of murders in which he provides an alibi for himself by assuming the identity of one of the people he kills.  The obvious problem with this plan is that people mistake him for himself when he is disguised as somebody else.  I think the main reason I missed out on the humor of this film is that it walks so near to the ridiculous line that society toes anyway.  For example, it is almost impossible to make a satire on an action movie because action movies are so ridiculously exagurated to begin with.  But that is why American Psycho is brilliant, it puts a magnifying glass on a part of society we overlook and brings it into its horrific focus using primarilly the ideas that the society espouses itself.  The film is a tremendous artistic achievement and it is important that audiences don't give up on it too soon.  Like ""Fight Club,"" until you know what the movie is trying to achieve, it is an uncomfortable viewing experience.  But once you understand it, you see that the blood and the violence is totally necessary and justified in making a responsible comment about the ills of society that most immediatly need to be rectified.",994636800,7,2909,4.809236947791165
70465,5,0783243499,"Based on an equally disturbing book , American Psycho is a spectacular movie if you have the stomach for it . It tells the story of yuppie Patrick Bateman who , along with his friends , spends the biggest part of the day worrying about what they wear , eat and listen . Bateman has another side in his private live though. He is a cold-blooded murderer . He takes his victim's lives with the worst possible way. Analyzing the meaning behind Whitney Houston's music or Huey Lewis & And The News's lyrics is obviously not enough to define himself. Not that he kills people  in order to achieve that . It's more like an effort from a man who has no inner-side ( as he himself confesses in front of the mirror ) to feel alive in a way . The murder scenes are absolutely abominable and can almost cause damage to a sensitive person's soul . Haron doesn't hesitate to add black humour touches to a movie as shockingly gory as this one ( Bateman washes...his gloves after that meeting with his collegue in the bathroom ) . Yet it's Bale's exceptional perfomance as the sick psycho which makes this as great and breath-taking as it is.

70477,4,0783243499,"The film catches the atmosphere of the book very nicely, but it avoids most gruesome details and especially those that are more extreme and shocking. This film wants to give the gist of the book and it is a real success. The hero is a golden boy among other golden boys, but he knows this world is a total illusion, maybe even a lie. The lie of money, easy money and the illusion of the power of this money. His extreme personality makes him look for the most extreme sensations and these can only come from the physical suffering he can impose onto people, either by torturing them or by killing them. This is nothing but a metaphor of the vain and aimless chase for money. Money, the blood of society, is translated into the real blood of other people, and this blood has to run on his hands and face to be really felt, just like money has to run from his hands in the face of other people to express its power. He is a killer because he is unable to limit his power to the sole flow of money which is only a simulacra of the flow of life, and first of all the flow of blood. Hence the character is psychotic. But the metaphor works also the other way and society is psychotic, money is criminal, money making is an uncontroled permanent assassination of the richness of a culture that is always present in his personality. He engulfs himself in music and long dissertations on music when he starts stepping beyond the limit of sanity. So his criminal activities become the realisation of the flow of music, the linguistic flow of his highly intellectual and elaborate commentary on the music. And here is the third metaphorical level : the flow of music and his flow of commentary on the music go along with the flow of blood he criminally causes as a trespassing action beyond the sole flow of money. His wealth of intellectual dissertation on music is the cultural side of his wealth in money and this otherland leads him to bathe in a wealth of blood. Even if the film is not a masterpiece it is a thought raking and prompting adventure, and it is an adventure to enter such a film, because you feel concerned at once by this post-modern psychosis, a psychosis many of us live and try to dominate, even if unaware of it because of our good training and our desire to integrate in society.

70478,4,0783243499,"You might think you know what to expect of ""American Psycho"" just by looking at the cover or reading a brief summary of it's plot. However, like it's title character, Patrick Bateman, what you see on the outside is nothing like what is going on inside. Don't make the mistake of thinking this movie is just a cheap slasher flick (check out the sequel for that) or even a horror movie at all. Sure, it's horrifying at moments, and damn suspenseful in others, but what ""American Psycho"" boils down to is a satire of a superficial society, based primarily on which apartment you rent, what clothes you wear, who you're sleeping with, and what your business card looks like. A world that could only exist in New York City, in the 80's. Do the words ""Die Yuppie Scum"" mean anything to you?

Christian Bale plays Bateman to perfection. I can't say I ever read the book, but Bale brings the character to life almost effortlessly. In fact, it's impossible at this point for me to see him in any movie without recalling his role here. He just never lets up. Patrick Bateman is cynical, malicious and downright hilarious, all in one. The supporting cast is rather impressive as well, with Willem Dafoe playing a detective suspicious of Bateman, Reese Witherspoon playing his plastic fiance and Jared Leto playing his unspoken rival. Made in 2000, but set in the 80's, the movie looks and feels like it's time. Watching the movie, you can almost feel the cold streets of New York as Patrick gives his own assistance to a helpless vagrant. ""American Psycho"" is possibly as cold-hearted and as mean a movie as you can find, but it is saved by its blacker-than-black sense of humor.

The violence is so strong that many readers were blinded to the sporadic humour of the piece, often laugh out loud funny.  Happily, the film takes all the redeeming qualities of the novel and builds on them, creating another beast entirely.  The film plays as a black comedy, not horror. There is a little bloodshed for the Fangoria hounds here, but most of the violence is off screen, left to the dark pits of imagination.  Christian Bale gives a career making performance, making Patrick Bateman a ridiculous blend of Casey Casem and any masked axe wielding killer you could think of.  But most importantly the film acts as a satirical look at the cultural emptiness of the eighties, and the emptiness of Bateman.  Don't be afraid!

Although I admired the satirical boldness with which it equates the figurative and literal bloodlust/murderous impulses of those engendered by corporate culture and those experienced by serial killers (I'll let you figure out which is which), it's still not a easy film to sit through.  There are some excellent scenes however, such as the business cards scene and Patrick Bateman's hilariously unnerving analysis of music from Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, etc.  As a music fan, I find the implication that only the psychotic fringe would enjoy soporific Top 40 pop music completely delightful.  The problem with the film is that, like its source, it is all one note and it becomes irritating and uncomfortable after awhile.  And the film takes a easy way out near the end to make things more palatable to the audience (we'll henceforth refer to this type of travesty as the 'Fight Club' Syndrome).  However, this film is not without its share of brilliance, foremost of which is how Harron aims a scathing satire, even more so than the one directed at corporate culture, towards us, the people in the audience, for our desire to be entertained by violence and horror.

Lurking under all of the shocking scenes of death and sex lays a message about the greed, materialism, and soullessness that dominated the business world and culture of the 1980's.  Although I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is still somewhat sensitive to violence in movies, both the entertainment and philosophical value of this movie makes this film a very worthwhile use of time.  Bateman's intense daily routine of hygiene and the fierce competition between businessmen over business cards are just two examples of the both hilarious eccentricities of the characters in the film and the dark result of a lifetime characterized by ambition and vanity.  This film brings up interesting points about the interchangeability of human beings in modern culture.  Bateman's decent into insanity leads wonderfully into the very fulfill climax.

I think the fact that the director was a woman gave it a perspective that a male director, no matter how talented, could not have nailed. Instead of focussing on the acts themselves, which the book was rumored to do, it focusses rather on the arrogance and charm of the person committing those acts. The murders are in the background, not the foreground of the story. The movie may also have ran the risk of glorifying Patrick Bateman, but instead the audience is encouraged to find him shallow, wittless, and soulless. This also makes for very hilarious scenes of awkward encounters, botched murders, sloppy killing sprees, and an attempt at feeding a cat to an ATM (can you say ""index finger in society's eyeball?"").

Harron's directorial eye for everything from scene pacing to lighting to interior decor (Bateman's all-white furniture and spotless apartment is perfect) makes the movie work very well. She gets the satire, and even (at times, anyway) manages to keep the movie itself from descending into to the misogynistic filth of its subject matter and protagonist. So, yeah, well-made. On the other hand, i hated it. The violence made me feel like i was being repeatedly kicked in the stomach, and i never really did sort out whether i was supposed to like this guy or not. Naturally, he's a Clockwork Orange-style antihero, but like that movie, after a couple hours of brutality we're meant to feel pity for him because being rich and handsome makes him sad. Really, it comes down to the fact that, as well-made or as well-acted (Christian Bale is astounding; and really it IS worth seeing if only for his performance), or as well-intended the message about the soul-nullifying effect of materialism, it's just not really fun to watch.

As I watched the movie and Bateman's (close to Bates, as in Norman ?) behavior got more and more outlandish, and the one-ups-manship of the yuppies got shallower and shallower, I got defensive and almost stopped watching. The end was incredibly strange, and it was only AFTER I finished watching that it struck me - did he really commit all those gruesome murders, or were they all in his vacant mind ?? One will note that the 'style' of 2 of the murders were replicas of movies he had watched just prior to 'murdering' - were his sprees real, or were they his illusions as found in the datebook by his secretary ?
Was this a sarcastic commentary on 80's yuppie selfishness ? That above all, they wanted ATTENTION ? Did Bateman want to be reknown for doing something so horrible and despicable, want to set himself apart from his peers, ultimately, want to be caught for the ""ME-trip"" of it ?

Here the ending is so sudden and abrupt, that it leaves everything hanging in the air; I didn't actually think the film was over until  the titles started rolling!  Perhaps I'm just not intelligent enough to understand this film, but it seemed rather pointless and shallow to me.

His character was not an easy one to portray and the whole time I watched it the first two times, I couldn't get over how well he portrays this character.  While Tom Hanks gets a lot of accolades for his performances, I think a lot of his performances reflect his personality into the character.  This character that Christian portrays is complex, dark, and emotionless on the inside yet outgoing and extremely educated on the outside and Christian performs both sides to absolute perfection.  The whole time you watch him you just marvel at how well he pulls off everything he does.  The rest of the characters within the movie really don't contribute much other than a supporting cast.  Christian is the star and what makes this movie what it is.  Is the movie disturbing in parts???  Yes!  Is it sexist???  Yes!!  Do the characters display superficiality??? Yes!!

70510,2,0783243499,"American Psycho (Mary Herron, 2000)

Bret Easton Ellis' novel American Psycho is the nadir of the eighties novel; it reads, roughly, like a three hundred page Sharper Image catalog, an endless listing of brand names and prices with nothing even remotely resembling a soul. When the film was released, the critics quickly came to the same conclusion about it. After a few months, however, better reviews of the film began to surface fromindependent critics and the like, calling it a
brilliant satire, wickedly funny, you know, that sort of thing. So I had to rent it. My constant repeating thought was ""it can't be as bad as the book.""

I was right. That's not saying much.

Christian Bale (who's going to be typecast as a sleazebag if he doesn't watch out) plays Patrick Bateman, a man whose obsession with fitting in to the fast-moving upperclass Wall Street society of his father manifests itself both as an obsession with the brand names of the things he utilizes in his daily routine and as an unstoppable compulsion to murder.

Herron, who's certainly no stranger to ultraviolence (she's directed episodes of Homicide and Oz, as well as the cult hit I Shot Andy Warhol), does manage to capture a certain beauty to Bateman's homicidal rage; there's a particular scene where Bateman is chasing a prostitute (Cara Seymour) down a hallway with a chainsaw that's almost hypnotic. Where the movie fails is in the spaces between. It's almost as if Ellis wrote the novel on a bet-- ""can you take a perfectly shallow character and center a whole book around him?"" The result, in both book and film, is painfully obvious; it can be done, but it's not that much fun to experience.

This makes it all the more painful that so many wonderful roles surface in this film, not least up-and-comer Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, a woman who stands out as the true beauty in a shallow world of glamour; Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream) as Paul Allen, a business partner of Bateman's; Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's oblivious, apoiled fiancee; and Willem Dafoe, as usual, taking a minor role (a homicide detective) and turning it into something palpably creepy.

When all is said and done, there's just not enough good here to counteract the horrid. * 1/2",985737600,2,2248,4.810880829015544
70511,3,0783243499,"Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman is vile and disgusting... just like he is supposed to be. In a tale based on a best-selling novel, this disturbing film showcases the excesses and disposability of American life in the 1980s. Bateman is a successful and financially well off New York corporate suit and tie who hangs around with other shallow and plastic carbon copies of himself. They compare business cards and become excited by the lettering and exact colours of the cards. It is quite stunning in its brutal shallowness. But when it comes to brutal, there is nothing quite so brutal as Bateman's disposable attitude toward people. About one quarter of the way into the movie, you realise that Bateman, while plastic and passionless in most ways, cannot get his aggressions and feelings out through any means of expression but violent and heinous murder. He murders prostitutes, strangers, co workers. You name it. The graphic depictions of these murders are unbelievable and caused controversy when the film was released. Strangely enough, though, all the violence and blood and gore makes it onto the screen but a sex scene between Bateman and two prostitutes was censored. The funny thing about this film is that while there are a few notable actors in it (Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's fiance, Jared Leto as Bateman's office nemesis Paul Allen, and Samantha Mathis as Bateman's sometime sex partner) none of them is more than one dimensional, except maybe the secretary simply because she is not caught up in the plastic world which all these others occupy.  I suppose this is the point and all the actors have done their jobs well as a result. Is this a good movie worth your time? Not so sure. I went to see it at the cinema when it was first released, and I had to get up and leave halfway through because there were people all around me eating and making too much noise.

70512,3,0783243499,"I hate mixing literature with film but I must in this case.
This film catches a book that seemed to be unfilmable. The film doesn't rely on violence as much as it does dark comedy. If it did it would have had a much bigger reception in the box office. When I saw this film I felt it was very reminiscent of Hitchcock. What I don't understand is why the NC-17 rating on the film for those small differences? But you miss little in the R rated as opposed to unrated version.
This film is so Hitchcock-esque I am suprised I did not catch a cameo of Mary Harron on-screen.
This film was darkly funny, but not nearly as darkly funny as the book. I wish Harron would have caught on to the manic episodes that Bateman has in the book.
The focus on male vanity makes this film such a comic riff on males. Where this movie fails is that it should have been more focused on the insanity of the eighties zeitgiest. It was more focused on the pure male rage and reverse psychology male bashing.
This narrative is that of a Wall St. New York city setting. This film could have used a NYC backdrop rather than soundstages and Toronto Canada. The Canadian psycho really turned me off.
 Christian Bale gives a great performance of elitist Ivy League scum. This film is him. Though if the film were to have starred DiCaprio there may have been funding for a NYC backdrop and more time to cover the facets missed. But nonetheless hats off to Ms. Harron to filming the novel that was deemed unfilmable.

Score: 78/100
American Psycho is not what I expected it to be. I thought it would be part of the ""I Still Know What Mrs. Tingle Did With You Idle Hands Last Friday the 13th"" routine, but this individual and occasionally stunning feature is a real horror film for a real adult audience.
Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a respected Wall Street businessman by day. Outside of work, though, he is an accomplished serial killer. After the murder of a rival, Paul Allen (Jared Leto), a private investigator (Willem Dafoe) starts to pick up his trail as Bateman starts to go mental in covering his tracks.
The plot is fairly thin on the ground, and the film has a poor shoot-out finale, but this is still an imaginable, carefully crafted film that is highly controversial because of it's continuous violence and rather odd sexual themes, but Christian Bale and Mary Harron work excellently and co-operate well together to make this film hugely successful with both critics and our friends at the box office. The film has a lot of laugh-out-loud funny moments, but if you're expecting a horror-thriller type, you won't be disappointed. There is no shortage of shocks; one immediately scary part is where Bateman chases his regular prostitute around a hotel room with a terrifying chainsaw sound. Christian Bale's performance is another great thing about this great movie; he perfectly catches Bateman's rise and fall with excellent acting skills and awesome narration.
Both hip and cool, American Psycho is an underrated little movie that deserves praise.",984787200,,1567,5.030769230769231
70515,3,0783243499,"Watching American Psycho was one of the most unnerving cinematic experiences I've ever been through (the 1997 German-made film Funny Games (subtitled) being the most tramatic for me). A satire of the materialism and the ""me-ism"" of the 80's? OK. A dark comedy?? I hardly think so, at least not in the way dark comedy is supposed to work. The movie tries to be too many things to the point that ultimately, it failed for me. It tries satire, horror, psychological ""probing"" for answers, (although this is understated) unanswered questions, surprise; in short, everything seems thrown into the mix. And even with all of the film's ability to transfix viewers by the sheer audacity of the plot and its execution (seriously, no pun intended), however horrific, I just felt sick to my stomach and VERY depressed when it ended. NOTHING is funny about torture and murder, whatever the context, unless it's explicitly clear FROM THE START AND WITHOUT A DOUBT that dark comedy is the goal (i.e. the late Paul Bartel's 1982 flick Eating Raoul comes to mind).
As a male I found the film repugnant and offensive, especially by the cavalier way that sex, brutality, and murder are depicted. Without ignoring the fact that Bale's character is quite sick, whether the acts were actually committed or just in his diseased mind, the film disturbes on a more basic level because it reinforces the notion that men get pleasure from violent sex, from wielding power over women, and just that men can't be trusted, period. Not one male character in the film is depicted in a positive way. Women have plenty enough images of these sick, sadistic men; women are already terrified enough of these men and of the horrifying chances of encountering them. At times I felt the film bordered on an indictment of all male behavior when it comes to sex and power over others. OK, maybe I'm overstating my case here, but that's just how unpleasant the film came off to me (obviously, not that it was supposed to be pleasant), and as such, I just can't buy the notion of dark comedy.

70526,1,0783243499,"This was quite possibly one of the most horrifying and disgusting movies that I have ever seen in my life.  I know that many people loved not only this film, but also Christian Bale's portrayal of the coolly sadistic Wall Street killer Patrick Bateman. I have to say that I am not one of those people.  (There are many other movies that accurately show Bale's fine physique and acting skills besides this one!)  While Bale was certainly able to get into the role of Bateman, and in my opinion gave an accurate picture of this man's terrible thoughts, actions and egoism, I was still greatly offended by this movie.  While I do not consider myself a prude, this movie beat anything that I have ever seen.  I thought the scenes in which Bale's character brutalizes women after forcing them to perform various lewd and embarrassing sex acts on both him and each other were horrifying and degrading.  The movie just seemed like one long, neverending ride whose only purpose was to display Bateman's control over handfuls of helpless women through violent sex and murder. While I won't ruin the plot for those of you who wish to see the movie, I will say that there was one scene which made me almost lose it.  It was one in which Bateman brutalizes a woman while a frightened prostitute he has hired is forced to watch. When the prostitute tries to escape from his apartment, he runs after her and cuts her in half with a chainsaw.  This scene was made particularly outrageous by the fact that Bale's character is completely naked while he is murdering this woman.  Many people in the audience thought this scene was one of the funniest parts of the movie, but I felt that it was shocking and offensive. While I am not easily frightened and believe I have a good sense of humor, this movie disturbed me so deeply and was not funny to me at all.  It gave me a nightmarish feeling that lingered for hours after I saw it.  I do not know how anyone could even have felt this movie was worthy to be classified as a ""black comedy"".  I felt that even the humor that the Bateman character used in everyday society was patronizing, rude and offensive.  The movie also contained scenes of animal abuse and showed the murders of several defenseless people, including a homeless man and an elderly woman.  All of this terrible violence made me sick, and if you are faint of heart or are squeamish in general, I would not recommend this movie at all.  ""American Psycho"" may be considered by some to be director Mary Harron's crowning achievement, since it covers the challenging territory of a killer's mind - or, some argue, simply the sick fantasies of an ""ordinary"" man.  Whatever the case may be, I feel that this movie is one of the worst examples of filmmaking that I have seen in years. For me, a movie about torture and murder is not entertainment.  I am not trying to take the high moral ground, but as a young woman ""American Psycho"" was grossly offensive to my sensibilities. To me, it displayed women as objects that were simply used and discarded by Bale's character, either for meaningless sex (as in several scenes) or for torture and murder, as in others.  I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and that my views are not similar to many of the reviews written on this website.  However, I would encourage anyone interested in seeing this movie to rent it before buying it, and then decide if they would like to add it to their video collection.",984268800,5,3461,4.5621970920840065

This film is very intelligent, underplayed, and well done. It never gets very gory, leaving you to imagine the atrocities rather than be presented them in graphic detail.  As a satire of the 80s, I think that this film works somewhat well. As a portrait of a sadistic sociopath, this film works much better.
This film makes statements about the lack of personal connection in the 80s society. Status symbols, expensive dinners, and posh clubs have become substitutes for emotions and real connections.  Patrick's coworkers cannot distinguish him from other men. He is mistaken for others at several points. Eerily, all the men in this movie do look alike, with slicked back hair and immaculate designer suits. The film reminded me more than once of the great book but lesser movie ""Bright Lights, Big City"".
There are moments of sheer terror in this film...

70531,5,0783243499,"Mesmerizing adaptation of the controversial novel by the same name, American Psycho scores on every conceivable level.  As a psychological thriller there are none better.  As a gere film it's among the best of it's kind.  And as a black comedy it's rivaled only by the 1989 cult classic Vampires Kiss, to which it bears a striking resemblence.  In short it's the best film of the early 21st century and one of my all time favorites.
Christian Bale, his name above the title for the first time in his career, stars as Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic Wall Street yuppie who may or may not be a serial killer, depending on your point of view.  By that I mean, second time director Mary Harron (avoiding the sophomore slump) leaves the movie open to interruption.  And if you're looking for easy answers there aren't any here.  The euphoric tone in which the story unfolds seems to suggest, in retrospect, that the movie may actually be the elaborate fantasy of a very deranged individual.  Or maybe it's the setting, Reagan-era New York, that makes it seem so alien.  Either way it's a tremendously thought-provoking film that should have people talking for a long time to come.
Just imagine if Leonardo DiCaprio were in the lead?  It'd have been interesting to see if he could have made such sophisticated art house fare fly with mainstream American.  But at the same time he would have deprived us of one of the best performances I can remember, ever!  It's not that Chris Bale looses himself in the character so much as Patrick Bateman has no character, and it's that understanding that he brings to the role.  He's always acting, which is an important component to the performance because Bateman is acting himself, just trying to fit in.  And he does, which is most disturbing of all.  Not the blood or the gore, which is toned down from the book, but the fact that he fits in so well.  Maybe that's the most tellling statement of all, to say that society bears the responsibilty for having created the Patrick Bateman's of the world.
His rampage begins by taking the life of a homeless man, to which he feels his financial status entitles him to.  He moves on to supposed ""productive"" members of society who, despite all their money, never seem to be doing much work.  It's then, after killing Paul Allen (Jared Leto), that he finds himself being questioned by a private investigator (Willem Dafoe), seemingly more interested in flirting with him than interrogating him.  I'm not sure if this was intentional on Dafoe's part but it adds to an already layered cast of characters.
Especially interesting of that bunch is Cara Seymour in a performance so drop dead hysterical (excuse the in joke) that she'll have you laughing long after the movie's over.  She plays Christie, a street walker who falls victim to Bateman's most violent fantasy.  This is one of those tongue-in-cheek moments that manages to be both terrifying and funny at the same time.
Of course, I don't mean to suggest this for everybody, because as most of the best films usually are, it's of an acquired taste.  Anyone not willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the premise should be advised to stay away.  Especially when you consider you're being asked to invest in a protagonist who has essentially no redeeming qualities except for the fact that he's potrayed by an actor of immeasurable talent, Christian Bale, whose sure to win over more fans (known as Baleheads) with this star-making performance.
So for those of you with no qualms over endearing yourself to a really bad guy, you're in for a smart, scary thriller that's one of the most chilling of this or any other year.",982627200,5,3656,4.740916271721959

An era of all style, no substance, and a perfect setting for this searing indictment against male vanity and territoriality. Christain Bale gives a rare performance as Patrick Bateman, a business suit-clad serial killer whose charming smile and uncanny fashion sense just barely hides a seething hatred for women and disturbing psychotic impulses. This is a performance of true power and wit and Bale throws himself into the role without a hint of self-preservation, a rare quality for an actor. The men portrayed in this film are as empty as their lives, their existence marked only by their haircuts and designer suits. The Bateman character could easily be anyone in the film, they are all the same person, the only difference between them is where they hang out, who they have dinner with, the ease with which they get reservations. The character of Bateman is reduced to spouting off philosophies behind POP SONGS of all things in order to show that he has a single original thought in his head (and the sight of an empty, meaningless character reaching for meaning in something as empty and meaningless as a Whitney Houston song is extremely funny). When Bateman and company are sitting around a meeting table swapping business cards, the scene takes on a perverse meaning, as if they were swapping the size of their members. It all adds up to an extremely funny film for those who appreciate this type of satire. However, the film has a very dark side to it as well. The graphic nature of the violence in the novel has been toned down or removed, but it is shocking nonetheless as Bateman splits open the head of one of his rivals (off-screen, mind you) and then casually sits down and lights a cigar. The callousness and seeming inhumanity of Bateman is frightening. Director Mary Harron creates a beautiful film given it's subject matter and it looks like it cost millions more then it did to make. Add great supporting work by Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Samantha Mathis, and Chloe Sevigny (who shares the most memorable scene with Bale, a date in which they completely mis-read each other's motives) and you have a film that's as entertaining as it is thought-provoking.

It's really not meant to be taken literally, and the movie increasingly makes that apparent, as in one scene where Christian Bale's date doesn't notice him putting down plastic on all the furniture (in preparation for the gore to follow) or another where he runs naked and screaming through an apartment building wielding a running chainsaw and not a soul notices.
Scenes like these are definite high points, both humorous and horrifying, and driving home the filmmaker's point (about soulless, faceless businessmen) with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
At times, however, the vision is less clear. I suspect that the MPAA, or maybe just concern over what the MPAA would allow, took a lot of the needed edge off this film.  My rating is for the R-rated, as-seen-in-theaters version.
Also, the ending is a sort of twist.  But it only works as a twist if you've been taking the movie literally, which is very hard to do. (Some people had this problem with ""Fight Club"", too. I didn't but the two movies are only superficially similar.)
Keep in mind, though, this isn't a movie with a lot of sympathy toward any of the characters. There's not much chance that you're going to identify with Bateman, and ultimately we're moved from a deatched loathing to a detached pity, which makes it an entirely different experience from other movies which address similar themes. It's not like ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"", where Henry is this sort of nice guy with a small problem (a penchant toward murder) but more like ""Silence Of The Lambs"" without the characters of Claire and Hannibal Lechter.
I hope that gives some idea of what to expect from this movie. It's interesting to note that the violence and sex is over-the-top, but not gratuitous--but in the long run, censors don't really care about that sort of thing.",980294400,,2187,4.889487870619946
70537,2,0783243499,"When I go to the movies, I can handle killings and murders. I can handle people going insane in their own minds, and people surrounding them suffering the consequences. That's not a shot to me; you've seen one death, the rest all seem like eye candy. What I don't like it killings and murders without a sensible plot. There has to be a motive, or a point ultimately made in the ending, that satisfies me well enough to have understood why the killer does what he or she does. Then, it's a good movie.
""American Psycho"" tried its best to fall into that category, though it succeeded only through its failure. The beginning of the movie was set up quite well, but from then on, all we get is the opinions and actions of a man so obsessed with himself that his motives are so petty and pointless. The movie tries so hard to be a satire of its characters, when in reality, it does nothing but give us a little more bloodshed and massacre than most other movies of this genre.
The movie follows the everyday proceedings of a successful businessman by the name of Patrick Bateman, a commodities broker who has an insatiable lust for murder and an extreme amount of disdain for all of those around him. This contempt he holds for everyone in his life, known or unknown, is the cause of his mental snaps, which leads him to commit one heinous act after another. And that's all the movie really is: his descent further and further as he begins killing more people and covering it up like nothing has happened. I can't go into details about the ending, so really, it's your choice as to whether or not it is a redeeming feature for the rest of the movie.
The only thing that I found admirable about the film is the fact that it is a no-holds-barred deal, and it seems as though it was made with no regard whatsoever about how the MPAA would deal with its extreme level of sexual and violent content. I admire a movie maker who can look society straight in the eye and basically say, ""Hey, this is a movie. Some of it actually does happen in real life. Start realizing it."" This is one of those movies, and for that, I give it credit.
However, I was vastly put off by Bateman's overly egotistical attitude towards everything in his life. It begins in a scene when he wakes up in the morning and takes a shower, and a voice over details everything that he does in regard to washing and cleaning his face, how many crunches he can do (""I can go up to 1,000 now.""), and his opinions on life in general. If they had left it at that with this scene, I would've been okay with it, but instead, it extends throughout the entire movie. Even during sex, he cannot help but look at himself in the mirror and flex his bicep. This is the ruinous feature of the film; there's just too much of it for me, and I'm sure others, to handle.
While the subject matter of the movie is not the greatest I've ever seen, the actors do a terrific job in their roles. Christian Bale is a standout as Patrick Bateman, and plays out the egotistical maniac role quite well. He is the film, basically. He is able to somewhat keep the movie together in certain places where it is needed.
The movie does not have a bad premise to it, but the attitudes and feelings of the characters throughout the film ruin it, so to speak. If they had concentrated more on the satirical nature of the plot, then it would be a far better success than what it really is: bland, and as emotionless as its main character.",980294400,,3459,4.339506172839506

70541,5,0783243499,"Unfortunately for ""American Psycho,"" the book has already garnered such a notoriously controversial stature that the film itself has a difficult task in trying to win over viewers. Like ""Natural Born Killers,"" many people may have already made up their minds about this movie long before they even consider watching it.
Like ""The Fight Club, ""American Psycho"" is a movie that could not be more misunderstood. Sure, this is about a psychopath on the most childishly obvious of all levels, but most of all this is satire on the yuppies of the mid to late 80's. It is an exploration in the hollow, meaningless existence of a rich Wall Street stock broker. A man who's life is so consumed by greed and power lunches that he can only find salvation whilst murdering someone. All the best scenes of ""American Psycho"" occur in the first three quarters of an hour. Christian Bale meticulously describes his morning routine with hilarious results and constantly tries to explain the significance of 1980's pop music. ""The Greatest Love of All's transcendant beauty makes it by far Whitney Houston's most accomplished record"" he claims, before butchering two girls. There is also a perfect scene in which Bale and his peers spend ten minutes arguing over who's business card font is better.
The violence (and sex) may be unsettling to some but is often times hilarious if you are willing to take it with a grain of salt. How can you not laugh when a bank machine asks Bale to ""feed me a stray cat?""
This is a very clever and sophisticated film that could be perceived incorrectly. It is one of 2000's finer movies and deserves something better than to be overlooked because of the book's notoriety.",978652800,18,1688,4.804123711340206
70542,3,0783243499,"Imagine a combination of  Bonfire of the Vanities, Fight Club and Theatre of Death and you'll get an idea of what the film American Psycho is like-- Yuppies, testosterone, and high camp.  It zeroes in on the easiest of targets, and delights in skewering the yuppie life-style in sick and sadistic fashion.  Well that's not exactly true --  in Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 best-seller the victims were mostly  mercilessly tortured before they were brutally killed and every detail was grimly described.  It was a very disturbing book.  It almost wasn't published.
The film however, barely touches on the sadism and misogyny of the book.  It's a poseur film, skimming the surfaces of already overly- skimmed surfaces, making very easily made points, and getting very obvious and easy laughs.
This compromise is significant when compared to the book, the book took the plunge and never came up for air.  That's why the book just won't go completely away, it might not have a lot on its mind, but it sure cuts right to the bone.  Forget about the book, though, few have actually read it.  Quite a few bought it and started to read it, but most didn't finish it.  It's too gross, too bloody, too bleak, too sick, and too repetitious.
I was surprised at how much fun I had while watching the film, knowing what a watered down compromise it is.  Perhaps  watching the yuppies of the 80's getting their deserved bashing is the updated equivalent of snobby rich folks who wind up getting hit with pies in Three Stooges shorts.  It's quite fun.
Another big reason for enjoying  it all so much is Christian Bale.  He plays the part with the kind of put on airs the reminded  me of some not quite human mix of Vincent Price and James Mason trapped inside a California type male model.  And though the performance is mannered, it doesn't feel forced.  It's not a performance coming from a stage actor ,who would be too keenly aware of when an audience might be reacting or laughing.  It's the type of performance a film actor like DeNiro, would have delivered to us when he was younger.  Now Bale hardly looks like an average  New Yorker as Patrick Bateman but I found the performance very entertaining. It carries the film.
Patrick Bateman is an extremely successful business man, his dad is a major stockholder so he's got job security and so is bored and easily distracted.  Patrick plays the competitive game with his co-workers, making sure he has the latest gadgets, the right shoes, the expensive tailored suits.  He must keep fit and look good and employs an exacting ritual involving soaps, creams, facial masks and herbal lotions to make sure he looks his best every day.  He works out obsessively, sometimes while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  However, he barely has his own identity.  A running joke in the film has him being mistaken for one of his co-workers.  A key scene in the film involves an in-depth analysis and discussion about Business Cards.  Low key, but specially designed business cards that the young Yuppie's talk about and become envious of.
Eventually we realize that Patrick Bateman (reminiscent of the similarly named Norman Bates) has a strange hobby.  He likes to kill.  We first see his dark side when a street person begs him for money.  Suddenly, Bateman savagely stabs the pitiful beggar.  Afterward he straightens his clothing, sighs, and goes about his business.  Just a way to relieve some stress, a way to cope with the pressure.
In other words, here's a Yuppie who has completely twisted any sense of morals to believe someone else's life is as insignificant as a two year old BMW.  Can he really get away with this? We find out he sure can.  He seems unstoppable.
The film could have wound up being flat and stale.  But it never is.  It's a film about style, made with some flair and it feels fresher than it has any right to.  This is because there is a  feminist viewpoint brought to the film by  Mary Harron who directed and co-wrote the film with Guinevere Turner.  The film's Patrick Bateman is a selfish, self obsessed, type A driven male.  A fragile, preening creature that is not an atypical Hollywood movie serial killer nor a killer who murders when in a  homicidal rage.  In fact this killer prefers to control the stage he kills in, often able to provide his own background music, maybe something by Huey Lewis, or  maybe something by Phil Collins. Patrick Bateman is a big fan of songs like It's Hip to Be Square and SuSudio.  To Patrick Bateman, killing is his true orgasm.  He can  control himself for short periods of time, but he's  weak, he's male and he's gonna blow sooner or later.  He's going to kill and kill again.  Maybe all this killing is even all in his mind -- nothing more than a twisted yuppie fantasy. Then again, perhaps it's not.  Whatever he can't completely control --he kills.  If something gets through to him, touches him, or exposes something vulnerable,-- he kills.
Willem Dafoe playing a detective on Bateman's trail was a great idea, but nothing is done with it, and Reese Witherspoon seems the kind of future trophy wife a guy like Bateman would have.  Jared Leto  plays  the kind of Yuppie scum everyone hates.  In fact we hate this guy so much he makes Bateman palatable.  His character is named Paul Allen which is funnier now, (particularly to someone in the NorthWest) than it was when the book was written.
Chloe (Boys Don't Cry) Sevigny as a secretary who has a crush on Bateman makes a real impression.  She finds a sweetness within her character that humanizes and warms every scene she's in.  Without her performance the film would be a completely cold exercise in style. Cara Seymour plays a prostitute Bateman picks up to play games.  She finds a fascinating balance of fear, vulnerability, need and self-loathing in her portrayal and makes a lasting impression though her screen time is short.
It's a sick black comedy with some truly twisted ideas. The gore in the film however is not as plentiful as you might think and none of it feels real enough to be disturbing.",978566400,2,6061,4.6862559241706165

70544,5,0783243499,"Patrick Bateman, the yuppie serial killer du jour created by Bret Easton Ellis, is obsessed with all things superficial. Ellis' written world is full of super-attractive young men with secret killer ways. He wallows in his protagonist's masochistic behavior and only occasionally manages to step back and comment on his behavior on a larger scale. Patrick Bateman is intended to be the metaphor for Reaganism on the kill but somehow this message is muddled amidst the non-stop name-dropping and unending detail that Ellis gives to Bateman's ritualistic killings.
Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) one-ups Ellis in just about every department with her screen adaptation. The fact that many designers did not grant Harron the permission to use their names in the film could have been a Godsend because it forces Harron to focus on the more relevant nuances of her character. Harron brilliantly establishes Bateman's attraction for all things narcissistic in a scene where he describes his daily facial rejuvenating process while standing in front of his bathroom mirror. If you combine that moment with Bateman's non-stop exercise regime and his desire to dine at the fanciest of restaurants, you have a Bateman that is concerned with nothing more than his own beautification.
The infamous threesome scene that slapped the film with an NC-17 rating is a great one because it shows Bateman, played with astonishing madness by Christian Bale, completely detached from the act of sex. Much like Ellis' portrait of Bateman, he is a man more concerned with performance than with the actual act of sex. While having sex with the women he looks at himself in the mirror. He is making love to himself, enjoying his muscular body as it masochistically berates the women.
Although Patrick Bateman is a completely loathsome soul, Harron appropriately adds a certain human element to her psycho killer. Even though Bateman admits over voice-over that he is devoid of any emotion there is a scene in the movie where we get a sense that he is seeking some sort of salvation from the world he has created for himself. After bringing his secretary (Chloe Sevigny) to his apartment, he has her leave after telling her that if she doesn't he might do something horrible to her.
Bateman's sadistic ways are certainly a product of some twisted childhood or adult experiences but Harron does not choose to focus on this. There is a tongue-in-cheek moment where Bateman apologizes to a dinner-date for being late by saying that he is a `product of divorce' but this is about the only glimpse we get into the character's pre-killer days. It's as if Harron is flippantly teasing us with the comment, knowing that we are itching for some sort of Freudian psychoanalysis of her character.
The gore is at a significantly lesser scale than one would be expected considering source material. Aside from one astonishingly executed sequence where a prostitute (Cara Seymour) flees from Patrick down some stairs, the killings in the film are handled in a comedic, albeit disturbing, way. The women in the film do not get much characterization but this is an appropriate thing when you consider that the film is shot through Bateman's eyes, a man that is little concerned with the motivations of his victims.
There is a moment at the end of Psycho's wonderful finale where the characters are watching a presidential address by Reagan. They blankly comment on the program and we basically learn that their lives will continue as is. I wish there were more of these moments because so much of Psycho's substance lies in the way that these men are seen as products of the society that was created under Reagan's America. Bateman's soul is one that is consumed by greed and it seems that he has been given a second chance by film's end. Whether he will take this exit or continue this masquerade is open to interpretation and perhaps dependent on whatever political shift should sway the nation.",978393600,,3955,4.9488721804511275
70545,4,0783243499,"I have to say, personally, that ""American Psycho"" was one of the better films to be released in the year 2000. Compared to the other drivel and cliched movies that Hollywood released, expecting the audiences to unquestioningly choke down with their popcorn, ""American Psycho"" was a stand out and well-worth checking out, in my opinion.
The main character, Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), is the perfect example of the limitless clones that wondered through their selfish and uncaring lives in the American 1980s, devoid of any sense of common human morals and sense of decency. He works and lives Wallstreet, and what sets him apart from his other Harvard Vs. Yale ""friends"" is that he is completely and utterly insane. While his co-workers are stressing over deciding on which font setting looks best on their business cards and trying to get reservations at the stylish restaurant of the week, Bateman is struggling with his unquenchable lust to murder. The movie takes off from there, trying to show whether or not Patrick will go too far with his evil desires.
What I really liked about ""American Psycho,"" besides the fact that it was better than 90% of the other films released in 2000, was that it didn't rely on gore and gratuitous violence to create an entertaining movie. The fact is that most of the violence is implied. Movies like ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" in the recent resurface in the teen horror flick genre have featured more violence and have left me more disturbed in its visual violence than in watching ""American Psycho.""
Another aspect is that each actor or actress works very well in his or her part, each showing the total insignificance of one person to the other in the corrupt business world of the 1980s. Some characters don't show up as much because they are just not important, and especially not meaningful to Patrick Bateman.
The 1980s are captured very well in this film. From the discussions Bateman has about popular music acts of the time to sly references to sitcoms.
This film works very well on three levels: first as a satire of the Yuppie Wallstreet era of the 1980s; second, as a murderous dark comedy; and third, as a surreal look into the mind of a very disturbed individual.
If you like dark comedies much like ""Evil Dead II"" and ""Fight Club,"" then you'll probably enjoy ""American Psycho."" However, if you don't like movies that push the limits to the mainstream, then you'll probably want to skip this one. This one is not for the kiddies (they won't understand) and not for the politically minded with strong left or right tendencies (they won't understand).

2. Annoying voice-over:  I'm more forgiving of this technique than most, but the criticism is well deserved here.  It's a poor substitute for tight story and competent direction. The main character's narcissism, the Wall Street milieu, his shallow and acquisitive colleagues, and his taste for insipid music should suffice to establish his soulless hollowness; there's no need for verbal cue cards. I suspect it's just the director's attempt to cut through the tedium of the movie and try to legitimize the film by evoking the novel.
3. Reese Witherspoon:  Knowing what she's capable of, I can only conclude that she was hobbled by a bad script and sophomoric direction. Just a one-dimensional rehash of Madeline Kahn from Young Frankenstein and Gloria Upson from Auntie Mame. Talk about poo-poo undies.  4. Running gags:  How many times does the viewer have to see the same jokes about business card fonts and the inability to get dinner reservations?
5. Dead-end plot devices:  A private eye played by Willem Defoe and a case of mistaken identity that go nowhere. Was this bad editing or did the filmmaker forget herself. ""Excuse me, I was looking for the set of 'Talented Mr Ripley'.""

70561,1,0783243499,"I guess I'm publicly exposing myself as not being too clever by criticizing this movie, since some real smart people have praised it so highly.
If you don't already know, this piece of ""art"" is one long series of people being very casually stabbed, chopped, shot, nail-gunned, chain-sawed, and so forthed to death, along with an animal or two. And no, you don't see the ax actually hit the head, but you do see it swing and you see the blood fly and you see the bodies hung up on meat hooks in the closet afterwards.
I'm not much into these violent movies myself, but my wife likes somewhat scary ones and rented this thinking it was more of a straight-forward thriller. Some other reviewers interpreted this movie (correctly, I suppose) as being satirical, ironic, or funny, but we sure didn't see it that way. True, the whole thing was filled with an extreme bizarreness, but we did not find ourselves laughing. The only result for me was that ""suspension of disbelief"" never kicked in and I sat there shocked that anyone would make a film so full of so much stupid pointless violence. Actually I wound up reading a magazine throughout much of it. There wasn't any real story here that I could detect. Maybe If I hadn't been reading a magazine I could have figured out what the heck the ending was supposed to mean. Oh well.
I find it very disturbing that people would make such a movie as this and rake in their big bucks without ever stopping to think what might happen if some not-so-stable person watched it and decided to imitate it. Mind you, I'm by no means calling for any sort of government censorship here. In fact, I'm the chair of our local Libertarian Party affiliate and I devote considerable energy to fighting such governmental actions. But I also realize that the other side of the freedom coin is personal responsibility, including on the part of movie-makers. As I will continue to argue myself, those watching this type of movie must be held responsible for their own actions. And almost nobody who watches this one movie will get kicked over to the ""dark side"" and become a serial killer.
Almost nobody. But it's a big world, isn't it?
Again, I'm 100% against governmental action to restrict what we can see. But this is my private action. I'm telling you, don't encourage the scum that made this trash by spending your money on it.

The writing duo trim the 399 page novel down to a workable film length, but then add certain mindnumbing and distracting scenes which cripple the pacing of the film. In particular, the chainsaw sequence becomes a lengthy chase scene reminiscent of a film student aping Brian Depalma aping Hitchcock. Derivative scenes such as that not only mar the film's pacing, but move the film from dark satirical comedy to ludicrous farce. Maybe Harron was a better choice than Oliver Stone or those pushing for a ultra-violent version, but better is relative and should not be confused with excellence.",977616000,,737,5.15

Very funny and violent at times, American Psycho is just a great movie.  The Unrated Version DVD is very nice.  The only additional footage in the Unrated Version is some added footage in the wild sex scene, and a little extra blood.  The DVD is very nice with a featurette and a Christian Bale interview.

There is no suspense, because there is no reason to care what happens.  Christian Bale does a great job, there's just nothing for him to work with here.  The usually likable William Dafoe isn't in the movie enough to develop any sense of who his character is.  The only remotely sympathetic character is the killer's secretary, and she is also a minor character.  All the other characters are completely dislikable.
I feel really horrible about throwing away the (money) on  it because I've probably helped encourage Mary Harron to make another movie.  This is really a bad movie with no redeeming qualities what so ever.  The soundtrack consists of a lot of the worst music from the 80's (Huey Lewis and the News for example) combined with orchestral music that sounds like it came from a bad television show.
This movie was billed as a satire but there's really nothing funny or amusing about it.  Its mostly just obnoxious, shallow people hanging out together.  The movie is far to angry and empty to ever be witty or amusing even if the writers were capable of wit or intelligence.  It consists of scenes where the yuppies try to get dinner reservations at fancy restraurants, admire each other's business cards, or pontificate on the greatness of Huey Lewis while killing someone.
Oh yea, there's also a scene where a dog gets stomped to death.  Gee, that was hysterical.
If you want to see a much better movie in the same vein, see Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs, or Seven.  These movies are much more intelligent and much better made.  There are actually characters to care about in these movies and the soundtracks are great to.

70566,3,0783243499,"""American Psycho"" is one of the most disturbing films I have seen all year. Christian Bale is frightening yet hilarious as the titular character Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street hot shot who indulges in his sick pleasures by night. He murders homeless people, prostitutes and even his own friends. Bateman is a character who feels nothing and cares about nothing save his own material possessions and outward appearance. ""American Psycho"" is much less gory than the novel on which it is based. Instead of being a straight horror film ""American Psycho"" wisely opted to be an original satire on the materialism of the 1980's. The film opens with a bang and possesses the same sick and funny energy until the end when it begins to lag a bit. But for the most part of the film I was interested in Patrick Bateman's tale. If you enjoy dark humor and have a strong stomach, I strongly suggest this film. It's not a film I would want to watch over and over again. It's not a classic, but it is still a good film.",977011200,,1003,4.516483516483516

Most of them I can't say in this review because they are too adult-oriented. But I will say ""Don't just stare at it, Eat it!""  The performances in this film were very memorable. Christian Bale is an actor whose career I will watch with great interest. Reese Witherspoon is funny and sarcastic as ever. Jared Leto did okay but his most memorable scene was his death scene. The rest of the cast was fine but the true star of this film is Christian Bale.  The film is great and worthy of 5 stars. But it does not have enough special features to make it a 5 star DVD.

70568,5,0783243499,"I remember reading Ellis' ""American Psycho"" during the early 1990s.  At that time, and in my circle, only a few of us a) liked the book, b) understood its message/s, or c) identified with the characters.  When I learned of the cinematic aspirations, I was very skeptical.  Especially after finding out that the director/s were female.  I was convinced that their gender would erase some important filters which Ellis illustrated in fine literary form.  As reluctant as I was, I attended a pre-opening day screening in order to put all my worst fears to rest.  However, from the initial scene I was enthralled and impressed; almost proud of the fact that I (and a select few) had discovered this masterpiece in its purest form almost a decade earlier.  The sleek and seductive surroundings and camera angles proved to be almost as descriptive as my own imagination during that first reading.  Though, I've read countless reviews and analysis of this film, I feel compelled for the American audience to fully understand what its nature is;  what the rhetoric means, and possible states of inspiration.  O.K., most reviewers mention the comic aspects of the film/book.  From a purely characteristic perception, there is no comedy involved.  For example, Patrick Bateman (played brilliantly by Christian Bale) seemingly can't fathom a cohort attaining better looking business cards than he.  When he perceives this to happen, he goes into an obvious meltdown.  To the audience, this seems inane and comical, almost a harmless light-hearted look into the pretentiousness of the 1980s.  However, to Mr. Bateman his world is crashing down.  His ego is shattering.  And there's nothing he can do at the time except internalize his psychosis.  There's really nothing funny about that from the main character's perspective.  There isn't time or room for all of the other examples of mispercieved ""dark"" humour, so I shall continue with the meaning of Patrick Bateman's murderous rampage.  He collects bodies like sports coats, and thrives on the seedier aspects of urban life.  He doesn't walk-the-talk of the classic yuppie and is prone to manic breakdowns.  Herein lies the key to the film:  Patrick Bateman's fragile, eggshell mental state.  During the film, the successful audience member must ask himself, ""Has Patrick Bateman actually slashed these people in his life?  Or is he freeing himself (his mind) to do so later?""  This is where Ellis truly retrieves his ""psycho"" in the title.  Viewed from this standpoint, the movie shall transcend its own platonic acetate, and the viewer can seemingly watch two movies simultaneously.  I won't allow myself to uncover too terribly much, as several readers probably haven't seen the film, but the final scene opens up many new possibilities for the main character.  This film sets a new standard in American cinematography, and to miss it can only leave a large hole in your entertainment life. In a word:  CLASSIC!",976752000,2,2956,5.097916666666666

The main purpose of this movie was to tell the tale of a ruthless serial killer that looked like an average guy.  It takes place during the 80's and just as in the book, the movie focuses on greed.  Money is an object that means nothing but can get you everything that you desire.  Drugs, clubbing, eating expensive food, and keeping yourself looking good.  All of these are the items that mean everything to the main character.  What was disturbing about this film was the killing.  It was done with a satire feel, which in itself was interesting and original, but was odd and made you think twice about what you were watching.

One might answer this question like this... ""People are Stupid"".. but that's not the answer, it's because people (unlike critics) go to the movies for Entertainment.. If all the critics that raved about ""American Psycho"" had used the word Entertaining, it would have made about 60-80 million, and if it had Leonardo De Caprio like the producers wanted, it would be up with ""Titanic"".
""American Psycho"" is highly entertaining the whole way through, hysterically funny most of the way through and Ultra-violent for about 10 seconds, you average freddy 27 and Jason 49 have double the blood, triple the body-count and a ""Video Premiere"" sticker on there video cover. It really is not very violent at all. (am I just getting sicker, or is the world over-populated by cry-babies) If the film had been released in the time it was set, (the 80's) it would be slapped with a PG 13, released alongside ""Commando"", ""Running Man"" and ""Cobra"", it would become a cult favourite with pre-teens, and would be lost among the sea of violent 80's videos at your local Blockbuster.

70571,5,0783243499,"As the other reviews have stated, this movie is a fine satire of consumerism and the greed of this growing yuppie culture.  But it is also more than that.  It is an existential view of human nature, of the emptiness and uselessness of life, of being totally, utterly, alone.  Bateman's character, who we are led to believe is a psychopath trying to convince himself that he is just insane, and therefore not responsible for the terror he creates, is trying desperately to connect with another human being.  He has an idea that if he cuts them up and plays with their insides, and keeps their body, that he will find something more than the superficial outside.  He is unable to show his inside, albeit one created by an empty society, unless he is with someone whom he about to either kill or sexually abuse.  That is when he starts with his views on music, his one connection with anything more than material.  But even his views sound very processed, and, though full of insight, lack any true emotional connection to anything.  Bateman points out that he has only two recognizable emotions: greed and disgust.  All other emotions he turns into emptiness.  Early on, his fiance asks him why he must continue to do what he does.  He answers ""because I want to fit in"".  That is all he wants; he wants to be part of humanity, and connect with others.  However, as he kills, he becomes farther and farther away from anything human.  The brilliant ending completely twists the storyline.  I won't say what happens, so as not to ruin it, but I will say that he gives a cry for help that is not heard, and he realizes that he is just a lost soul with no hope of redemption.  At this point it becomes apparent that he is in fact insane, but not in the way that he believed--he appears to be schizophrenic, very distant from reality.  As he drifts away his pain becomes more and more acute.  That is the most disturbing aspect of this movie, more so than any violence or sex.  The comfort we can take is that he is truly insane, and for most people there is a way out: his emptiness, as I mentioned, is not purely that.  He does have many emotions, he just does not see them.  He needs to examine himself, then he may achieve the salvation he cannot find in others.  However, before I realized that, I found the movie awfully disturbing, as it suggested that we are all lost souls, with absolutely no hope of ever touching anything real.

Many people assume (myself included) that this would be a slasher flick, but nothing could be farther from the truth. Based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the Me Generation, Christian Bale takes us through a sometimes unsettling and always entertaing tour of the kind of self-centered vacuous yuppies that have come to be associated with the eighties. Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a soulless, opulent man who kills indiscriminantly, hates everyone, and finds his only source of joy in pop music, his reviews of which pop up frequently throughout the movie. The plot hinges on one fact: because Bateman looks so successful, he can get away with anything, even though he may not want to. The self-loathing but carefully preened focus of the movie is actually one of only two characters, the other being his assistant Chloe Sevigny.

70574,2,0783243499,"Mary Harron's  *American Psycho*  is not a BAD movie, necessarily; it just isn't much of a movie.  It certainly fails at satire, because you obviously need a target worth satirizing, and -- I'm sorry -- 1980's-era yuppies were ALREADY ridiculous to begin with.  How can you make them more ridiculous than they already were?  It's like making fun of game show hosts -- an exercise in redundancy.
Harron has said that she has attempted to  ""rescue""  the book by Bret Ellis from its bad reputation.  (Why bother?)  Her strategy is, first of all, to make this film a period-piece, i.e., cell phones bigger than one's head; that ghastly  ""nouvelle cuisine""  thing that was going on in New York and L.A.; Walkmans; Huey Lewis and the News . . . so forth.  Of course, by putting the murderous subtext so firmly in the past, you tend to distance the movie from all the blood our serial killer spills.  As I watched all this, I was thinking that there was no good reason NOT to have this movie set in the present day.  I mean, let me get this straight:  people have NOT made a killing on Wall Street in the 90's?  people quit wearing Walkmans?  is  ""fusion""  cuisine any better than  ""nouvelle""?  are the Spice Girls less tacky than Huey Lewis?  In other words, we're in no position to sit back smugly and laugh at the trends of ten or fifteen years ago.
Other failures:  the stilted dialogue and narration, which, I take it, is directly from the book.  (Now I KNOW I'll never read the dang thing.)  Christian Bale's impossible task is to give convincing readings of lines like  ""Phil Collins'  solo work is more commerical, and therefore satisfying in a narrower way.""  Sheesh!  This isn't a real person.  I like Bale, but this is an unplayable part -- there isn't a believable moment in it.  However, the satire does get sharper when the yuppies are sitting around comparing business cards.  The film is almost worth watching for that scene alone -- it's hilarious.
But Harron is so intimidated by her material!  Every frame shouts  ""Don't get mad!  It's a satire!  It's a satire!""  Not that I was counting, but doesn't Bale end up killing more MEN than women?  You better believe this was by design.  The reason we know of Ellis'  book in the first place was its graphic description of mutilations perpetrated upon women.  There's virtually nothing like that in this movie.  And to further neuter the material, we're led to believe at the end that all of it was in the guy's head, anyway.

I haven't read the Bret Easton Ellis novel but what is certain is that literature allows a lot of liberties cinema simply can not translate in images unless you are Jean-Luc Godard or Orson Welles.
AMERICAN PSYCHO tries to describe a peculiar world, the world of the 1980 New-York yuppies. These yuppies are very snob without the cultural background found in, let's say for instance, the englishmen of the first part of the XXth century. They are like empty shells, living a life of fast money, expensive restaurants and uninteresting social activities. Well, they don't particularly bother me as long as they stay in their artificial world. And I can easily imagine to what kind of excess easy money can drive a man who has not a solid moral history.
If I have understood well the purpose of the authors of AMERICAN PSYCHO, the movie, apart of this harsch critique of the yuppie world, would like to convince us that money and power could eventually lead someone to believe that he can be a new god, deciding who has the right to live and who should die, without being worried by consequences. Patrick Bateman, after a slow start, becomes less and less prudent and finally commit murders in the open light. Like the serial killers he admires, he wants unconsciously to be recognized. The movie often hesitates between the satire, the not so fairy tale, the horror and the moral genre, so feel free to have your own opinion about it.

Surface and ritual reign supreme, indeed characters confuse each other's identities with neither thought nor consequence. Sex, for Patrick Bateman (as probably for all others) is  an expression of vanity and power, nothing more. Patrick Bateman's only moments of true passion and fulfillment occur when he kills. Irony and paradox: does he kill so as to feel alive and vibrant, or does he kill precisely to feed his need to suppress feeling, like an alcoholic drinks to suppress his need for alcohol. Feelings, after all, are messy, not very elegant.  Irony itself conveys a measure of elegance. Thus the movie comments on itself. AmPsy is not really satire. There is no real madness or wackiness here, nor does it carry that element of pratfall, grotesquerie, reality turned inside out to affirm itself, which underly satiric points. It's a disquisition on a decade, a perspective, a way of being that is still very much part of us today. Perhaps now we do it a bit more vulgarly.  There is keen pleasure in realizing that the camera itself, more than words, is the scalpel for the irony which defines this chilly tale. I bet the screenplay is relatively short.

It failed, instead betraying admiration for all the material things it purported to condemn--fancy restaurants, luxury apartments, limos, cosmetics and the rest. It tried to be shocking. I yawned.
We were supposed to believe that the characters were high-powered Wall Street types, yet we never saw a single instance of them doing the work that earned them their astronomical salaries. All they did was make reservations and compare business cards.
The lead actor hammed up his part so much that his character lost all believability. Cloe Sevigny, a genuinely talented actor, was wasted. Poor Willem Dafoe. He aimlessly walked and talked through the middle of this mess, then disappeared.
Most good movies have a beginning, a middle and an end. American Psycho, however, was a plotless amalgam of unfunny restaurant scenes, boring sex and comic-book-type violence. No story was told, no characters were developed.
Many of the scenes insulted the viewer's intelligence. How can a killer drag a blood-leaking body across the floor of an apartment-building lobby and never be discovered? How can he chase a screaming woman through the halls and down the stairs of another apartment building, in the middle of New York City, and never draw attention?

The movie puts us in the mind of a mad man, Patrick Bateman, who's telling us his story.  Identity is a hard thing to come by in his Wall Street world, even for his male colleagues, with their unexplained misogynism.  Work, living address, clothes, restaurants frequented and particularly the design of one's business card are vital means for providing this.  Attempting to explain the point of everything to his fiancee, Bateman says in his careful pronunciation, ""Because I want to fit in.""
Bateman's story is complicated by his increasing insanity.  He tells us that he's very aware that he's not what he pretends to be.  But he's unaware in his storytelling that much if not all of his overpowering, murderous mental state is not really acted out.  We know this because of the completely outrageous and careless way his crimes are committed.  And secondly his desperate point blank confessions lack supporting physical evidence or response from the listener.  These confessions and Bateman's efforts to maintain composure produce a degree of pathos for a wretched and despicable character.
There are dark humorous touches in the movie.  One is Bateman's smooth, practiced critique of the profundity of the pop music that he plays during some of his crimes.  Above all the movie is not a gore fest.",973728000,,1362,5.040178571428571
70594,4,0783243499,"Oh my gosh.  This was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen.  If you were disturbed by Natural Born Killers, then you ain't seen nothin'  yet.  I was in the theater laughing at things I felt horrible for laughing at.  I was laughing at a serial killer, and so was everyone else in the theater.  A guy sitting beside me said to me, ""I feel bad for laughing at this but I can't help it.""  It was true, you couldn't. The movie was a social satire on the emphasis on materialism of the 80's.  It was about an investment banker, and his fellow collegues.  They would try to outdo each other in everything.  One of their favorite things to do was to compare business cards.  When someone would have a nicer card than Bateman, the main character, he would get one step closer to complete insanity. The first person he killed was a guy from work, whom he really didn't like.  He took him out for drinks, got him drunk, and then took him home.  When they got to Bateman's house, he had newspaper spread out all over the floor, with a chair with a sheet on it in the middle.  This is where the collegue sat down.  From that point you knew what was going to happen.  Bateman goes over to the CD player and puts on Huey Lewis and the News, Sports album, and then starts a running commentary on the band while Hip to be Square is playing, and while he is preparing to kill the guy. He goes into the kitchen, puts on a raincoat, and picks up an alluminum polished axe.  So shiny you could use it as a mirror for shaving.  He then walks into the room, and the guy asks him if that is a raincoat he is wearing.  He smiles and says yes. The guy then proceeds to ask him if that is an axe, and Bateman replies  pleasently, with a big grin on his face, ""Yes it is, and I'm going to kill you with it.""He then proceeds to chop the guy up with Hip to Be Square playing in the background.  Then we all started laughing.  I don't know if it was because of the bizarness of the scene, or if it was genuinely funny to us.  Regardless, I think that everyone felt wrong about laughing at it.  He goes on to kill some other people in the same ways.  By that I mean that each murder has music playing in the background, and him giving the history of the performer.  It ends very strangely. I won't tell you how, because I recommend you watch it, if you are an adult, that isn't on the verge of going psychotic, because if you are, this one may be more of a documentary, than a work of fiction for you. THE GOODChristian Bale did an excellent job of playing this Bateman guy.  He really acted psychotic.  The story was interesting.  It was a story of a cry for help, and the way people who only care about status don't care about anything else. THE BADThat a movie can make you laugh at this kind of stuff.  I'm not sure if it is right to find this sort of thing humorus, but in the situation of this movie, I think the filmakers were trying to show the absurdity of the status issue.

70595,4,0783243499,"This has got to be one of the best black comedies I have ever seen. For the first part of the movie I could not help but laugh out loud. It is hilarious!
But (not having read the book) guess who got sucked in and suckered out with the ending? This is class in a glass. The music, the clothes, the Master of the Universe yuppies all go to build a great background. Then there is Patrick Bateman (an outstanding performance by Christian Bale but more on that later)- a designer quoting, 1000 stomach crunches a day, body exfoliating and facial masking kind of corporate success you could see anywhere in the 80s.
But of course Patrick is different. He kills: he kills with hammers, axes, staple guns (a real big one), chain saws. He decapitates, delimbs, hangs bodies up in his closet or just shoots them. This is all done in such a stylised way that it is funny - not horrific.
But strongest of all is his narcissism. Because Patrick is just another screwed up yuppie who dreams all these murders, who cannot tell the difference between reality and a daydream but who is really no different to all his other peers.
I loved this movie because it took me in one direction (the black comedy, the blood, the psychosis of a man losing control) but then it kicked me back to a very cerebral and deeply intuitive understanding of human nature and the rage within.
Best of all was Christian Bale who I must admit I had not seen since Empire of the Sun. After you watch this DVD look at his interview. The difference between the character he plays and the actor himself is amazing to watch. What a performance, what an actor.

70607,2,0783243499,"They sure changed the flavor of the book that I read! Instead of making the book into a movie .. they made a movie from some highschool girls book report about the book. Being in high school she either .. A) didn't really read the book and only wrote her report about a few chapters or portions of chapters  B) had to leave out the sexy, gruesome stuff or parents and teachers would get upset  OR  C)  Didn't understand any of it so she wrote her book report about only the simplest parts that she did understand. This is what happens when a story that couldn't and probably shouldn't have been made into a movie - gets turned over to a production company that only wants to use the notoriety of the title to sell tickets. Once you are in the theater they can show you any story as long as the names of the characters are unchanged from the book, the locale and key catch lines and phrases remain. Although the acting performances were excellent when judged on their own merit .. American Psycho was so totally sanitized that it came out looking like ""The Shining Does Wall Street"" with an ending plucked straight out of the ""Dallas"" TV night time soap!  Patrick Bateman/Bobby Ewing really didn't do any of those things .. only in his mind/dream. The NOVEL left you UNDECIDED as to the reality of the deeds .. this MOVIE softens the whole thing and all but superimpose an ""IMAGINARY KILLER"" caption over Bateman's headshot at the end.

70608,4,0783243499,"No doubt about it, Mary Harrion's ""American Psycho"" is definitely not for every taste and audience demographic.  The good news is, perhaps, that the film is nowhere near as gruesome and gory as both its subject matter and its controversial nature would lead one to believe.  In fact, its tone of ironic comic detachment helps to de-emphasize the more sordid aspects of the material and to instead highlight the film's bitingly satiric message.
Set in the mid-1980's, ""American Psycho"" casts a scathing eye on the then-brand new, up-and-coming group of 20-something executives known as ""yuppies.""  Patrick Bateman, the psycho of the title, is a man who literally seems to have everything - stunning good looks, a fantastic physique, a beautiful fianc, a diploma from Harvard and a successful career as a Wall Street executive.  Yet, alone of the young men with whom he consorts, Patrick flatly admits to us in voice-over narration that he is literally an empty-suit - that his perfectly maintained outer appearance, seemingly well-ordered social routine and empty, superficial personal relationships merely mask the moral emptiness that lurks at the core of his soul.  Much of the complexity of Patrick's character comes from the fact that he seems, paradoxically, to be both obsessed with the idea of conforming to the values of the world he lives in, and, at the same time, being strangely conscious of their unreality and meaninglessness.  Thus, we see him becoming almost emotionally unglued because he fears he will not be able to reserve the proper table at a posh upscale restaurant or because he feels that one of his corporate buddies has a more impressive looking business card than he does.  Much of Patrick's madness has its roots in the kind of obsessive-compulsive paranoia that arises from the modern insistence that life should and, indeed, can be converted into a perfect, problem-free existence if one just has enough money and a sufficient amount of the right ""stuff"" to make it that way.  Frankly admitting that he feels no emotional attachment to any other human beings, Patrick is thereby free to channel his madness into its ultimate anti-social, taboo-shattering shape and form: serial killing.  Thus, as days turn to nights, Patrick begins to rack up his victims and potential victims - a homeless man, assorted prostitutes, an ex-girlfriend, an unctuous business associate, even some policemen who get wise to his activities later in the film.
Luckily for the squeamish among us, far more of the film's running time is devoted to a comic rather than thriller mode.  The brittle, dryly humorous Mary Harrion/Guinevere Turner screenplay mines the corporate world milieu and the twisted rantings of a values-free mind for all their black comedy potential.  Christian Bale brings a remarkable subtlety to a touchy role, managing to seem coolly alluring, chillingly detached, touchingly pathetic and wryly amusing all at the same time.  Special credit should go to the stark, almost antiseptic look the filmmakers achieve through the art direction and set design, a look that matches in visual terms the moral and emotional emptiness of the characters and their world.
Much was made of the anti-woman tone of the novel at the time of its initial release. Perhaps because the writers and the director are themselves women, the movie seems to have toned down that aspect quite a bit.  Indeed, as in a movie like ""In the Company of Men,"" we find ourselves not so much appalled as sadly bemused by the vehemently anti-women comments uttered by Patrick and his cronies because we see what shallow losers these men really are.  Harrion and Turner obviously know whereof they speak.
To reiterate, ""American Psycho"" may not be everyone's cup of cinematic tea, but those looking for a sharp little satire of modern American life will find some definite rewards.",972691200,234,3872,5.086750788643533
70609,4,0783243499,"about a week after I saw it.  There's something so arrogant and contrived about its sequences that you have to ask yourself ""is this for real?"" The answer, of course, is no. The whole film (as well as the book), in all its nonsense, is just a metaphor for a material society driven by impulse and self-gratification. You then realize that every scene portrays its characters as almost ""characters"" of themselves, polished and human-like ""packages"". Batemen, the most obvious, is basically the male distillation of everything that's reprehensible about human nature;  he's overly handsome, wealthy, resouceful and witty, and is part of unique Manhatten uptown clique.  What's interesting is how he represents the American Dream, everything that we secretly strive to be (or at least everything that the American culture leads us to believe is important), whether or not we know it;  the only difference being that he goes as far as to act out his impulses. So is Elliot saying that, we, as an audience, are suffocated by the American dream to the point where we have become numb under its spell, have become so lost in the process of obtaining status and material that we've lost touch with each other? That we've become selfish, self-centered, ego-maniacal performers in our own lives? That our conversations are hollow and superficial?  That our relationships are nothing more than devices built to enhance personal attainment? When we see Bateman, a reflection of our ideals, carry out ritualistic acts of violence, it come across as both disgusting and hilarious. I walked out of the theater feeling jipped, like I have been made fun of. And now, as I write this review, I am finally understanding that I, as an American, was being mocked. The second time I watched it I was even more humored by Bateman's dry and hammy performance. I agree that this movie is not for everyone, but watch it,  think about it,  give it a chance; the stuff on the screen is just a tool.",972432000,2,1970,4.862686567164179
70610,4,0783243499,"Where 1999 was considered one of the most exciting years for film, 2000 has been mostly derivative and dull as it quickly approaches an end.  The one movie that sticks out--I saw it twice in the theater--is ""American Psycho,"" a rib-tickling satire about young rich men who define themselves by hairstyle, bath products, the restaurants they eat at, etc.  As the hollow yet handsome yuppie serial killer Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale pulls off the act of being a soulless, angry snake quite well.
Despite other reviewers who take issue with the fact that the film isn't violent enough, a detail-by-detail adaptation of Ellis' book would go beyond an NC-17 (it'd be like watching snuff, probably).  Marry Harron's visual tricks imply most of the carnage, which may not be as disturbing as the scenes Ellis described, but do the trick all the same.
Like all well-crafted satires of late, ""American Psycho"" finds humor in the extremes of human behavior and the horrors we unleash on one another.  Even if this year had been as exciting as 1999, AP would still stick out.  As a spit in the eye of '80s greed, this tale is just a relevant today.",972432000,7,1141,4.771573604060913

70615,3,0783243499,"If Mary Harron's film has the slightest chance of being regarded as a success, it will only be seen as such by viewers unfamiliar with Bret Easton Ellis's novel.
The Ellis novel was relentlessly downbeat, its occasional black humour registering entirely intellectually. Flashes of brutal wit jolt the reader from the otherwise deliberate numbing produced by his obsessive-compulsive villain's soliloquays. Ellis's world is claustrophobic, oppressive: one in which every character is a monster of greed and moral apathy. Patrick Bateman is distinguished from his peers only by his commission of sickeningly and inventively brutal murders.
For all the disco-ball glamour of Bateman's world, the utter crassness of his monied yuppie compatriots undercuts any sense of a reader's vicarious envy. In any one of Ellis's setpiece exclusive restaurants, the maitre-d' is shockingly rude in the ugly American sense (as oppposed to a stereotypically highbrow French or English sense), the waitresses are surly and incompetent, and the nearby diners speak far too loudly about nothing but money and shopping. The most expensive evening in Manhattan turns out to be a very unpleasant experience indeed.
Harron very wrongly plays ""American Psycho"" for its 'comedy'. The atmosphere of its opening scene is reminiscent of an opera bouffe, as the credits are spelled in what first appears to be blood and is soon shown to be a berry sauce drizzled over elaborately presented food at--a cinematic and novelistic leitmotif---an exclusive restaurant.
The film is surprisingly non-violent on an explicit level, almost as much so as the novel was graphic. Harron perhaps dodged some ratings issues, in addition to a great deal of political flack, with her use of implied and off-screen violence, and much less of it at that than occurs in the Ellis story. However necessary such a choice may have been from the point of view of marketing, however, Harron loses a critical dimension of grittiness and actual (not only spiritual) horror. Bateman's madness and detached curiosity (according to Ellis) are explicated in the novel through the agency of his treatment of corpses, his forays into dissection and cannibalism.
Harron similarly airbrushes the grinding poverty, filthiness, and random, miscellaneous unpleasantnesses from Manhattan's streets. Tellingly, Ellis's novel begins with Bateman's judgemental observation of street people, depraved graffiti and garbage, as seen from a taxi window. Harron's film shows none of that, except in the brief meeting between Bateman and a beggar, a scene very much toned down from the novel.
One can only imagine how disasterous the once-rumoured casting of Leonardo diCaprio as Bateman might have been. DiCaprio's slender, unthreatening frame and distinctive facial beauty would have made it impossible either to fear him or to mistake him for others, as constantly happens in the plot of both the novel and the film.
Patrick Bateman, in Ellis's protrayal, is so flawlessly groomed and generically, nearly featurelessly handsome that he is occassionally taken for any vapidly perfect male model.
Harron chose Christian Bale well as a physical presence. He wears his designer suits with the oblivious comfort of the well-born, and his nearly perfect face is oddly forgettable. There is something enigmatic and seemingly incomplete about Bale's physiognomy: even watching direct shots of him taken at close-range, one has the sense of seeing something obliquely, as if part of his face were constantly obscured, or faceted ever so slightly out of the line of vision. Bale's lovely face is indeed one which, as the plot and characterization require, could be mistaken for that of any other equally handsome man.
The choice of a British actor for Bateman, however talented he may be, no doubt appeared to be a good idea in the initial casting process. Few American actors would appreciate the hyper-sensitivity to class issues which Ellis's Bateman ruminates on, endlessly and disdainfully, nor could they easily generate his droit de seigneur bearing.
There is, however, the very unfortunate matter of Bale's attempted American accent. Bale clearly spent mucht time studying the particular nasal bray of the Andover-Harvard aristocracy, but he never once pulls it off, sounding instead as if he had a slight speech impediment. Given that Bale is the lead, this constant distraction is most unfortunate for the film overall.
By soft-shoeing the hideousness of Bateman's acts; by relatively normalizing the members of his social circle; and by completely removing the other, darker, despairing New York from Bateman's designer world, Harron does much to reduce her lead to a bizarre but meaninglessly destructive cipher.
Unfortunately, Ellis's extraordinary sensitivity to sociological phenomena is rarely in evidence here. The more conflicted, intelligent, 'deeper' Bateman which Ellis so carefully constructs as a sort of human 'cautionary tale' ends up as something like the evil twin of Christian Bale's smirking, guffawing incarnation.",972086400,4,5057,5.443312101910828

It is not necessarily that I expected for Bateman to get his upcommance. Maybe I just missed the powerful subtlety of the climax of the film itself. Christian Bale is an excellent actor who must have had some kind of personal chuckle imitating an uptight, arrogant, wall-street American yuppie. Even his ""American"" accent was flawless !He played a character that you really not only hated for his literal cutthroat antics but for his annoying behavior and obessession as a neat freak !Yet, there appeared to be times in the story where his ""sickness"" was also a cry for help...like a rabid or diseased dog waiting to be caught and put out of it's misery. Bale gets 5 stars for his stellar performance.
My understanding of the film was that it was a twisted/dark satirical comedy coinciding with a slasher/thriller movie (sort of like a recording artist ala Sarah Brightman singing opera while on the next track singing a pop ballad all on the same album); Different genres within the same context or realm. It was not just about a nutcase hacking people, but it was also a social commentary about commercialism, consumerism, and capitalism (the ""holy trintiy"" of Wall Street and upper class America)!

Christian Bale gives a knockout, powerhouse, I only wish there were enough glowing agitives to describe, performance as Patick Bateman, a yuppie VP whose 'nightly bloodlust starts to slip into his days.'  That's not to say it's a particularly deep or profound performance, in fact it's that lack of depth that makes him such a marvel to watch.  You see Bateman's both an everyman and a nobody - a nameless, faceless drone steering his way through an ocean of disinterest.  Probably the most frightening aspect is the fact that he fits in so well.  The reason being that nobody really listens to what one another has to say, they're all just waiting for their turn to talk.  Fans of the novel, and I must confess I am one, in seek of graphic violence might want to look elsewhere becuase it's not the bloodshed that makes this movie so good.  It's the way it holds a mirror to us and forces some self-examination - something alot of us are very resistant to.  In the end it's a totally refreshing expierence, a movie that's actually not afraid to be original.

But here, we never really are absorbed into the character of Patrick Bateman and his cold, empty, sociopathology as we were in the diary-like novel.  This is no fault of Christian Bale, who plays the Wall Street raider by day, bloodlusting serial killer by night to the OTT hilt (the idea of Leonardo DiCaprio filling this role makes me cringe).  But whether you want to accept it or not, the graphic (and admittedly often misogynistic) violence of the novel was an important part of painting the picture of Bateman's loathsome and empty soul.  This necessary element was for the most part omitted here (out of fear on the part of the scriptwriters, I suspect) and as a result, the film provokes far less gut-reaction.  Harron should have pulled out the stops, stuck closer to the detail of the novel (if you felt the tediousness and repetition of Bateman's atrocities as the chapters faded one into another, well, think about that for a moment...), and let the NC-17 rating fall where it may; it wouldn't have discouraged this film's target audience.",970704000,,1307,4.838565022421525

This movie satires society in how some of us have become so preoccupied with being wealthy having the best of everything.  Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a wallstreet suit whose life is the material world.  He is a self-loving, materialistic s.o.b. who has a little hobby on the side.  He loves to kill people.
Some may find the acting dull, but the character of Bateman is just that.  He lives his life like it is a movie and he is just merely going along for the ride.  Those that get in his way just end up being killed, violently(the violence is shown off screen).  Bateman has absolutely no human emotions such as joy and pain.
The ending of the movie will surprise the viewers and really make them wonder what actually happened and what Bateman just imagined.  It gets trippy and weird.  I just wish the dvd had a commentary track as to explain what the hell was really going on.  Still,  the movie delivers its message across to the those with an open mind.
American Psycho truly satires the upperclass of the late 80s with a murderous twist.  People make reservations in restaurants just cause they can, not cause they're hungry.  They snort coke, use prostitutes, and compare the type of paper and the fonts of their business cards.  When they're at work, they seem at the top of their game.  Once at home,  they're rather dull.

David Lynch films, which are highly criticized at Amazon, are dark and disturbing.  This looks like something a hormonal 14 year old would put together.  The acting was terrible, except for the one shining moment of Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Evelyn.  Oh, and for the comment on those ""people that expected it to be like SCREAM or something""-- I despise Scream and those teeny bopper movies and this movie did NOTHING for me.  It seems as if it were some sort of ""message movie"" to warn against the dangers of capitalism.  The soundtrack was pretty good, but the problem is the best songs are not on the soundtrack.

70639,5,0783243499,"I was unable to make it beyond 50 pages in the incredibly grisly novel version of ""American Psycho"" written by Ellis.  However, my film group assured me that the movie version was an utter transformation of the novel and Christian Bale, as the lead, a major acting discovery.  The group was right. Rewritten with black humor at its core, this tale of the consummate yuppie of the 1980s, who is also a serial killer, held me spellbound, when I wasn't LOL.  Bale is also interviewed on the DVD version and you can barely tell he is the same person as the character he plays, Patrick Bateman.  This is not a mad-slasher film like ""Nightmare On Elm Street"".  So if you are looking for that kind of film, this will not fit the bill.  This is an exploration of the dark underside of a Harvard educated, privileged young CEO and his cohorts on Wall Street and the ""horror"" is how right the film feels. There is the issue raised of how real Bateman's murders are versus a complete breakdown of his psyche taking place instead.  However, this becomes one of the interesting points to debate after seeing this film and is not easily answered.  I'm keeping my eye peeled for the next film Christian Bale makes as he is an actor who could do marvelous work in the years ahead.

I normally like movies that make you think and are not main stream, but this movie sent chills up my spine.  Patrick was a pig, plain and simple.  He was a self centered, egotistical man who cared nothing of the people around him.  I believe he lived in a dark fantasy world dreaming up that he killed all these people without anyone noticing.  I don't think he fully understood how much the people he worked with and were so called friends with were laughing at him.

Brett Easton Ellis' novels explore a dark side of elite society...those people in the uppercrust who have everything, know everyone, and couldn't be more bored with their lives.  With his razor-sharp insight, you'd think Ellis speaks from firsthand experience and perhaps he does. Many people have faulted this movie, claiming it was insensitive, stupid, gross...and it is, in many ways.  But it's also clever, insightful, smart...and wickedly funny and true. That Christian Bale's character, Patrick Bateman, spends as much time dwelling on the suits he and his friends are wearing as he does on discussion of anything remotely ""important"" just drives home the idea of indifference.  Ellis' novels are full of these amazingly detailed accounts of clothing and fashion...this is what these people know!  Without bluntly saying so, it points out just how shallow society can be...and the film (and novel) point out just what one bored young man is capable of.

In a way I'm surprised, positively. 'Cause the film has some good ideas, some good parts. Like the visualization of Patrick Bateman's apartment, or his anger caused by pure jealousy and unfulfilledness.
But all in all, it is not a very good film. The story is reduced to nearly nothing. Some unnecessary (and very poorly done) stuff, like the killing of some policemen, is added which is very annoying to the whole concept. And although Christian Bale starts out well and is well-chosen for the role, he somehow gets too nervous in the long run.

70661,5,0783243499,"The book is horrible, funny and essential, but they could never have made it into a film.  The film is also horrible, funny and essential, but it ain't the book.  Mary Harron wisely decided not to do a Cannibal Holocaust on this one, and emphasised instead the black humour.  She and co-screenwriter Guenevere Turner (who'd have thought that that nice girl from Go Fish could end up writing American Psycho?) deliver the funniest film about twisted men since Fight Club.
Despite the contributions of Harron, Turner, the production designer, the cinematographer and the rest of the cast, it has to be said that this is Christian Bale's movie.  Leonardo Di Caprio just isn't in this league.  Bale transformed himself into an extraordinary simulacrum of a human being, a perfectly-accented, tautly-muscled, immaculately groomed Americanoid boy, whose cheery smile is constantly belied by eyes as dead as gun muzzles.  He's the most memorable cinema nutcase in a mainstream film since Travis Bickle.  The scene when he puts Huey Lewis on the stereo, dresses in a plastic raincoat and dances round the room preparatory to putting an axe into Jared Leto's head made me almost puke with laughter, and his instant turnaround into a frothing, bawling maniac is quite incredible.  His breakdown later on in the film almost makes you sympathise with this utterly hollow character.
It's pretty unthinkable that American Psycho will get an Oscar, but Bale proves himself to be one of the most technically adept and assured actors of his generation with this performance.  Slasher film fans will be let down (I saw it in a cinema in Plymouth UK, with an audience of people who clearly expected a Manhattan Chainsaw Massacre and who were audibly disappointed not to get it) but it's a sublimely horrible and great film.

The core subject matter is so  dark and despairing that the occasional laugh-out-loud scenes are quite  welcome when they occur. Christian Bale does an admirable job portraying  Charles Manson as a Yuppie.

The  name American Psycho made it look rather like a  slasher flick which is  what many people expected it to be. I live in Australia and the original  novel is rated R in Australia which means that anyone under 18 can't buy  the book. When I first heard that it had been made into a movie I was a bit  shocked. If a book was bad enough to earn an R rating then I was wondering  how could they go about screening it. But it turns out that they did a  rather good job. The movie still has the same story and a lot of the  bizarre sex and voilence, but it is not nearly as graphic as the book is.  This does not, however let the movie down in any way. Definatelly a worth  see and a fan of the book may be disappointed because of the lack of gore  but will still probably like it. As a DVD, it was given a fairly ordinary  treatment. Although it has stuning picture and sound quality, the extras a  fairly limited. It has the usual theatrical trailer, a five minute  interview with Christian Bale where he tells us how he became involved  in  the film and how he personally feels about the film, a very short making of  documentary that doesn't really reveal all that much, productions notes and  biographies of the cast and crew. It would have been better if it contained  a commentary track by director Mary Harron and Christian Bale, a longer  documentary and also have a section that tells us how Bret Easton Ellis  feels about the movie.

This movie isn't very  realistic, but that is the point of a satire, to blow out of proprotion  that evil that is within all of us. In the case, it was the utterly greedy  and secular upper class society of the 80's. It is fitting that i'd use a  keivin spacey quote, ""To get a person's attention, You can't just tap  on the shoulder anymore, you got to hit over the head with a  sledghammer"", that's what a social satire should do and that's what  American Psyhco does, it bluntly and forcefully makes the viewer see what  Christian Bale is and how he is nothing but a mere reflection of modern  society. When he kills, he feels alive, for his every day life is nothin  but a facade of brunches and buisness card duels.

70671,3,0783243499,"""American Psycho"" is not a great film, but it has enough style and gloss to make you virtually disregard it's array of weaknesses. The  only solid reason why it should be seen is for Christian Bale's performance  as Patrick Bateman. He captures the character's dual personalities; the  plastic-faced ladykiller and the chainsaw wielding maniac, and performs  with enough dynamic charisma to keep you diverted even when the film  misfires, which it does quite often. I was also quite impressed with film's  flamboyant visualization of upper-crust Manhattan during the 80's, watching  those nightclub scenes evoke strong memories of a time when excess and  campiness were in vogue. But even with these assets, ""American  Psycho"" suffers from a lack of visceral impact (the book, admittedly,  did have that) and a screenplay which can't seem to make up it's mind. Is  it a satire on yuppie materialism or a thriller about a man's increasing  bloodlust? If it was intended to be both, the results were confused,  especially during the final 20 minutes. There are indeed moments of insight  into the connection between then emptiness of society's values and Patrick  Bateman's absence of a soul (some of them funny, others disturbing) but the  film fails to get right inside the character's head. Overall,  ""American Psycho"" is nothing to brag about, but it will still  keep you interested, and Christian Bale gives a terrific performance as  well.",968889600,,1443,5.142241379310345
70672,3,0783243499,"Reading the book and seeing the movie were two completely different  experiences.  I read the book in 1993 and was repulsed, horrified, and  intrigued at the same time.  The book did what media strive to do - evoke  genuine emotion in the reader/viewer/listener.
The movie does a better  job of capturing what Ellis was probably trying to do - satirizing the  greed and materialism of Wall Street in the 80's (wait - did it go away?).  The film seemed very intimate - you were along for the hell ride that is  Bateman's life.  You could almost sympathize with his disdain for and  detachment from the life that was going on around him.  I got very nervous  every time the film reached a point that I remembered as being particularly  disturbing or grisly in the book.  Thankfully, the director had the sense  to imply the violence rather than throw it in our faces (ala Oliver Stone).
In all, the movie worked for me as more of a study in how to portray a  serial killer theme differently.  Christian Bale's performance was  excellent.  Although I was initially distracted by the robo-yuppie  inflection in his voice, I eventually realized that it was part of the  ""act"" that Bateman put on for the crowd.

70674,3,0783243499,"Does Amercan Psycho reveal anything about the 80's that most literate  people don't already know?  Certainly not.  As a social commentary, it  rarely goes beyond the obvious.  In fact, lines like: ""There is an  idea of Patrick Bateman... but I simply am not there"" are ridiculous  cliches, as is the ending, which I won't spoil.
The area in which  American Psycho succeeds is as a black comedy. I've seen some reviewers say  the dialogue is poorly written.  I think they might be missing the point.  The dialogue is intentionally vapid and superficial to the point where it  becomes humorous.  Bale does a tremendous job adding to the film's sharp  comic wit.  His saccarine grin and phony newscaster voice often benefit the  film by making his lines quite hilarious. In fact, the scene in which  Bateman kills Paul Allen after spending 5 minutes explaining the musical  genius of Huey Lewis and the News is quite possibly the funniest thing I've  seen in  a while.  Bale is almost Jim Carreyesque as he dances around with  an ax while pointing out the merits of ""Hip to be Square"" to the  unsuspecting victim.
It's only when the film strives to make a statement  on greed and emptiness that it fails. It's points and targets are obvious;  and the director beats us over the head with them by having the narrator  spell out every single statement the film is trying to make.

70685,4,0783243499,"This film, based on the impenetrable 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis,  performs an act that perhaps has never been done before by any film based  on a book: it improves the story.
Not that there was a whole lot of story  to begin with: a Wall Street account manager goes to a lot of clubs and  parties, frets about restaurant reservations, delivers wry, condescending  political manifestoes to amuse his friends, catalogues his own and his  friends' clothing (endlessly), reflects in curiously erudite fashion upon  '80s pop music, and.......oh yes, commits spectacularly violent murders in  his off-hours.
In the book, the scenes seem cut-and pasted together, the  characters and events completely interchangeable. If the story in the  classic novel is supposed to represent an arc, perhaps this story might be  well represented by a flat horizontal line. (EKG visual pun not intended.)  Ellis has trouble writing actual stories. But he has some literary gifts:  he can compose witty dialogue, composes apt descriptions of settings, and  is a decent expository writer. Somewhere along the line, Mr. Ellis may have  gotten the mistaken idea that a novel is merely the sum of its parts.
Mr. Ellis also has a most un-writerlike knack for publicity. It is of  course this gift that made his book such a notorious success.  It was bound  to be made into a movie, and, to the delight and chagrin of many, it was.  It was not a great book. The movie, however, is very good.
Part of this  is because violence for its own sake is more a subject for films than  books, and part is because director Mary Harron took advantage of the  book's lack of structure and of distinctiveness of its characters by  ruthlessly editing the book. She cuts out scenes, moving dialogue freely  from one character to another, moving action from one location to another.  She has eliminated all the book's novelistic pretension and fashioned a  film of visual elegance and sly wit from the remains.
Right off the bat,  Ellis' infuriating digressions on attire are easily disposed of by, well,  the very medium of film. The characters wear the clothes. You can see them.  They're very nice. You can't afford them. Point made.
In addition, the  book's amusing but context-free essays on pop music are woven into the  film's story as eerily out-of -place monologues by the protagonist Bateman  as he prepares his grisly work, helping define him as a person utterly  without social responsibity. In one such scene that recalls the famous  Michael Madsen ""ear"" dance from Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs,  Christian Bale as Bateman jogs with manic joy around his living room,  brandishing a raincoat and axe to the tune of ""Hip to be Square""  while pleading the case of Huey Lewis and the News for musical posterity to  Jared Leto's drunken, hapless victim Paul Allen.
Christian Bale's  performance as Patrick Bateman is a tour de force of smugness. His delivery  of Bateman is sheer hyperbole, a caricature of the voice of a spoiled urban  prep-school brat. He must have known that this material could not possibly  succeed if it were played straight. It is the single most redeeming feature  of this film, this oddly off-kilter starchiness of  Bateman, and it is  never less than fascinating. He never betrays a single genuine emotion  (except murderous rage) , and you wonder why it works.
I am not sure  that the reaction to this film will be what Harron intended. Apparently the  film was meant to be a withering indictment of greed and testosterone, and  yet I can visualize fraternity brothers across the country rewinding the  ""Huey Lewis"" scene countless times in the TV room and hooting  with glee.
It is to be admitted that this film will certainly do nothing  to remedy the de-sensitization of the American public to media violence.

70686,2,0783243499,"Not having read the book, I will take this film on its own merits.  ""American Psycho"" is a satirical horror film that had greater potential  than was realized.  Mary Harron's adaptation and direction seems to be the  problem.  Part of the story was a lampoon of the excessive materialism of  the 1980's, focusing particularly on the yuppie lifestyle.  That should  have served as the background for the character study.  However, Harron  pushed it to the foreground and exaggerated the portrayals of yuppie  superficiality and arrogance to the point where it became sophomoric.  She  then pounded on the point until it was threadbare.
The film would have  benefited from more development of Bateman's tortured inner self rather  than this obsession with his and his friends' way of life.  The story  presented an opportunity for a fresh approach to the horror genre.  Most  horror films are presented from the perspective of the victims, whereas  this story was from the killer's perspective.  In addition, since it was a  first person narrative, we had an opportunity to look inside the killer's  head.  Though some of that was done, too much of the introspection focused  on his thoughts about his lifestyle and not enough on his feelings about  the people he was killing or the acts themselves.
The acting by Bale was  excellent.  Though I didn't agree with Harron's vision of Bateman as the  poster child for yuppie conceit and tawdriness, Christian Bale played the  caricature to the hilt.  He was more pompous, supercilious and decadent  than your typical Roman Emperor.  The scene depicting his emotional  disintegration was terrifically done and very intense.
Overall, the way  the story was presented created an air of incredulity about all the  characters and their behavior which took the effectiveness out of the  psychological angle.  That left us with a mindless horror flick with only  mediocre effects.  Despite some excellent acting, I rated this film a 4/10.  A directorial hack job marred a good story concept.  Since it failed  miserably at the box office, the film's best hope is that it becomes a cult  classic in rental.  It is kitsch enough for that to be a distinct  possibility.",968457600,7,2204,5.013927576601671

Because Mary  Herron tries to scare you by what you not see. The movie shows mostly the  bitter black humor of the book, and the actors are brilliant.

70688,5,0783243499,"American Psycho, the film, is really a totally separate entity from  American Psycho, the novel.  Mary Harron, the director, has taken an  unfilmable novel and boiled it down to the vital components.  She has  extricated the satire and the humor from the novel's gratuitous (and  largely unnecessary) violence, which (I believe) detracts from the themes  of the novel.  Don't get me wrong, there is still plenty of violence and  gore in the film, but within the context of the film it is at an  appropriate level.  The film serves as an effective indictment of the  1980's ""Me"" culture and the yuppies who were responsible for  sustaining it.  Christian Bale nails the character of Patrick Bateman.  I  can't think of another actor who could have pulled it off with the kind of  bravado that he brings to the part.  Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't have the  physique or the vocal skills to be believable in Mary Harron's film.  Now,  he might have worked in Oliver Stone's American Psycho...but I'm glad that  combination didn't materialize.

I'm sure you've  read enough about this movie to know who and what Bateman is, so I won't  get in to specifics.
The movie is both a Horror-flick and a Comedy, all  meshed into one. You might not think that that's an easy thing to pull off,  but this movie does it just perfectly on all levels possible.
You're  never quite sure if Bateman really kills anyone. It might all be in his  head. There's no question about the fact that he's totally mental, but you  never really know about the murders. The murder-scenes aren't all that  gory. Sure, there's blood, but not extreme ammounts of it. As I also  mentioned, it's also a comedy. I laughed my ass of in some scenes, and so  will you, probably. You laugh at the fact that Bateman is so incredibly  sick and that he has such little connection to the ""real  world"".

In fact, I'm sure a  lot of people have fantasies such as these (when under pressure), but are  too rational to act on them.

70696,1,0783243499,"Perhaps the worst film of the year, American Psycho has very few  ""american"" qualities to it.  The movie is confusing, unappealing,  and full of irrelevance.
The movie is about an yuppie on Wall Street who  is trying to be better than everyone else.  Obsessed with success, sex,  and into drugs, Patrick Batemen works on Wall Street by day and plays  serial killer by night.  Or so it seems.  The ending of this movie is so  confusing, it led me to believe that some of the killing sequences are  Batemen's fantasies.  Specifically, in one scene, Batemen kills Paul Allen.  Later, he goes to Allen's apartment and kills two ladies and stores them  in the closet.  Subsequently, he visits the apartment and discovers it's  sold and no one seems to think anyone died there.  At the end, Batemen's  lawyer tells him that Paul is alive and that he has seen him in London.  So, what happened?
The movie also failed to be effective as a  suspense/horror/thriller due to its uneven pace.  At times, it slows to a  crawl, focusing on dinners, meetings that have little to add to the entire  story.  There are also a number of lines that are repeated for no apparent  reason.  For example, Batemen tells several people, ""I have to return  videos to the store.""  Did I miss something?

Taking lots of details, some sequences and the general feel of the  book, the filmmakers turn Ellis' nightmarish novel into a black comedy of  manners - a Merchant Ivory film with group sex and a chainsaw. The violence  is toned-down to a point where it's almost absent ('Very Bad Things' was  much nastier), and the obsessive detail of the book is left in the  exquisitely-detailed recreation of the late-80s. In fact, the lack of  violence hurts the film, in a way - Christian Bale's version of Bateman  seems like too much of an idiot to be the inventive, invulnerable amoralist  of his literary equivalent (and the physical resemblance to Chris Morris is  striking).

70703,1,0783243499,"When I first viewed this movie, I sat in horror, not by the idiotic acts of gore on the screen, but at the concept of paying money to watch such  garbage.  This is by far the most incompetently directed, poorly acted,  idiotically written movie in recent memory.  Granted there have been bad  movies, but this is the worst that's recieved so much noteriety.
  The actors compromise their performances, and you can tell why, they think  that by being in such an ""edgy and suspenseful movie that looks  thought provoking"" will get them an Oscar Nomination.  They are  dreaming.  The acting of the supporting cast and Witherspoon is so  horrible, it loses all potential for comedy.  Bale's performance is  mediocre, his 'intensity' in the most inappropriate places makes the film  tense when it could be comical (The incident in the washroom is the prime  example of a comedic opportunity squandered).
  The narration  (provided by the idiotic screenplay) points to us the obvious, like when he  peels away the face mask, we can get the message on our own, we don't have  to be led by the hand when dealing with such a cliche. ""Yeah, yeah,  the mask symbolizes the true self from the one we all see; he peels it away  to reveal his true self to the audience.""  We are not stupid, at least  credit us with that much, and try to at least be a little more creative in  conveying the message to us.  Harmon slaps us in the face with  that, she is assuming we are too stupid to comprehend this; she assumes  that no sophisticated people will be in the audience, only the violence  numbed horror loving teenagers that will think the movie is  ""cool"" because the guy uses a chainsaw.  It tries to kill two  birds with one jack hammer, it tries to be thought provoking and even  ""artsy"" by throwing in gratuitous nudity during his monologue.

To be sure, the film American Psycho is flawless, from the  opening title to the closing credits.  It is true to the book (minus one  ""controversial"" scene) but more importantly, stands alone.  As a  commentary on materialism, politics, media, fashion, and consumer culture,  it (correctly) points out that the true ""Psycho"" is not the  Norman Bates in all of us, but rather the Patrick ""Bate""man that  is America.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie (which if  you don't know is based on the novel of the same name). The recreation of  the overall mood one felt in the 80's (I lived through the 80's, but I was  very young) was dead-on, men in business suits, yammering on about where  they should ""do lunch"", no personalities. This movie is about one  Patrick Bateman (get it? Bates? Bateman?), a handsome young businessman in  the world of fast-cash, easy money. Despite his seemingly normal facade he  hides something sinister. Something which makes him feel the need to murder  in order to feel the slightest HINT of emotion or ""shock"".
  Okay, now I know alot of people here are saying the movie was about this  guy, Patrick, losing his mind and eventually killing a homeless man  etcetera etcetera. They think that it's about how... blah blah.. some guy  is tired of his lot in life. They're missing the point. It's about how  people can be so jaded that they don't realize who they may be talking to.  In the novel it covers this. In the novel there are two scenes mentioned  that nobody ever discusses. One involves the retelling of a cruise Bateman  took in which everybody on board (save him, imagine that) was butchered  with an axe. Another is where he is recalling a time in college where he  decapitates a female coed and hangs her from a tree. Mmmhmm, so you see, he  was ALWAYS insane.. he didn't BECOME insane.

First of all why does it require  death and violence to be a satire on America in the Eighties and second of  all since when has multiple homicides been humorous?

70710,5,0783243499,"After looking over the reviews for American Psycho I felt I'd put my two cents in. I see that some people felt the movie was sub-par and others felt it to be a Christian Bale tour-de-force, while others either liked or  disliked the adaptation to the big screen, and still others who seemed like  they didn't get the message at all. I didn't read the book before seeing  the film. It has been my experience with most books that they don't end up  making better movies. I liked American Psycho because I knew that it was a  satire of American culture in the 1980's. The film delivered a satire that  showed the extremes of our culture and also mocked it. I found the film to  have multilayers, which is a good film in my book. Plotless, not exactly,  perhaps simple, but not plotless. Here is a man who works on Wall Street.  He has no social life of his own, no ideas that are his own, no feelings  that are his own. He is breaking down mentally living in this sterile  condition in which emotions are severly downplayed, ignored or ridiculed.  What's next? The next logical step the main character takes is to kill a  transient--who he states he can't relate to. He goes on to attempt to kill  some hookers and some co-workers. All for the sake of feeling alive, of  feeling individual, of having or making some meaning out of his life. Since  it is a satire of the 1980's ""me"" culture, Patrick Bateman and  his world underline this culture to its fullest and then exaggerate it. I  thought it was well done. I can't think of any other movie that so  eloquently and intelligently mocks the 1980's culture and society. Of  course, this was only a slice of America during the 80's and not the whole  story. Christian Bale turned in a fine,  stilted/controlled/obsessive-compulsive/calculating performance of a  character that slowly breaks down and snaps under the pressure of having to  live under the oppressive circumstances he encounters. I thought it was  well directed and acted as well as written. I also have a tendency to like  films that have some element of social commentary/human condition to them.  But, people will see what they want to with any film and there are plenty  of other interpretations that can be applied to this film. I just think  it's original and re-watchable, and years from now some people will refer  back to this film as a trendsetter, because I'm sure there will be other  films that reach a wider audience that deal with the same themes touched  upon here. Oh yeah, I noticed that some reviewers didn't understand the  chainsaw scene and how no one could notice him running down the hall after  the hooker...well...isn't that just another example of the 1980's  ""me"" culture? If everyone is so absorbed in themselves, as they  supposedly were in the 80's, then no one would notice a naked man with a  chainsaw running down the hall after a hooker would they?

Upon seeing AMERICAN PSYCHO in a sold-out theater, it was painfully obvious to me that most of the movie-goers in there were  expecting something along the lines of SCREAM. A crumby slasher flick. A  story which displays a number of gruesome and well-thought out deaths. A  story where there is a hero. A story which ends happily ever after. This  movie had none of the above, which is what made it such a fantastic and  original film. Despite the graphic violence portrayed in the novel by Bret  Easton Ellis, most of the killing is off-screen and left to the viewers'  imagination. But the slaughter is also accompanied by fabulous black  humour. In fact, I can't remember the last time that I laughed so hard at a  movie (and was looked back at like there was truly something seriously  wrong with me).

First, pick a novel to butcher.  It doesn't really  matter what novel you pick, because what you are going to want to do is rob  it of its tone.  For instance, use Catcher in the Rye as your source  material for a gay porn flick.  You can do this because of that one little  part late in the book where Holden's old teacher makes a pass at him.  Okay, so we've got a gay porn Catcher, great.  Next, cast someone  thouroughly inappropriate to play the lead.  If American Psycho is our  template where the elegantly sinister yet vacuous Patrick Bateman is  transformed by Christian Bale into a grinning momo who can't dress himself,  then we need to turn our beloved, irreverent Holden into a punctual English  schoolboy complete with knickers, a crucifix, and a tongue which only gets  fiesty when it's time for some serious action.  Finally, remember how  Ellis' novel was a serious gorefest?  Remember the bum on fifth having his  eye sliced out to inaugurate it all and then the rats routing tunnels  through that chick's torso to conclude the festivities?  Well, none of that  is in the movie.  Neither were the ""hardbodies"", dapper threads  or Donald Trump musings which permeated the novel.  It's all right though.  Catcher in the Rye had no sex at all, and when there was mention of sex by  Holden, it was in relation to females.

Anyways, I saw the movie and must say it was one of the top 3 worst movies I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad  plot, bad script, and bad effects. I am not sure if they are encouraged at  amazon to can bad reviews to increase sales or what or if the people who  wrote the reviews saw the same movie I did. The movie was in the theaters  for how long? That should tell the story right there. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE  THIS PURCHASE, THERE ARE BETTER FILMS TO PURCHASE!.",964396800,3,573,4.035398230088496
70714,3,0783243499,"Unless you're a peychology major, you probably won't get much out of this film. In this movie, our main character preforms various sexual acts and then violently attacks and often murders his victims. If you are interested  in psychology, you can see a deeper meaning to the violence and sexual  display and into the mind of this corporate executive. I recomend this  movie for those interested in psychology. For everyone else, this movie is  probably a waste of your time.",962841600,,474,4.8875
70715,4,0783243499,"After seeing this movie the day it came out, I was very impressed.  The directing by Mary Harron is absoultely amazing, she really made the book come to life in this thriller..  The movie goes through twists and turns  and I recommend anyone this movie if you like thinking while watching  movies....  Pat Bateman, portrade by Christian Bale is the main character  throughout the movie there are many monologues which are absoultely  beautiful and make the movie no doubt... So if you like a moview that  twists and turns and has a high shock value this is the movie for you.",962841600,,575,4.623762376237623
70716,5,0783243499,"American Psycho is, hands down, one of the best movies made recently.  It is witty, smart, funny, and everything else you can ask for in a film.  It is well worth a look.  The story revolves around the wealthy, Wall  Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, played dead-on by Christian Bale.  Bateman  is, by day, a normal individual.  By night, he is a cold blooded killer.  Through lunches, dinners, dates, drug induced binges at bars, we begin to  learn that Bateman is no different from many people in the world.  But then  something happens.  He begins to think of what people would look like with  their insides out.  He gets jealous of other peoples' business cards and  wants them dead.  Nobody know though.  The charm of this story comes  from the descriptions Bateman gives in what his daily routine entails, what  type of suits he wears, what everyone else is wearing, and the music he  listens to.  Much like the book by Bret Easton Ellis, the film spends time  on these descriptions in a hilarious outcome, to show us how normal Bateman  is.  The charm also comes from his relationship to other characters,  particularly the wonderful Reese Witherspoon as his fiance, and the  beautiful Chloe Sevoine as his secretary.  These are two people who are  very close to him, yet know nothing about what is going on in his head.  This makes it even more creepy.  The book is a great piece of  literature and the film is a wonderful piece of cinema.  The great thing  about the movie version is that it focused on the story and the wit of the  book, not the violence.  This movie is not for the weak by any means, but  compared to the book, it is very tame.  I can definitely recommend  American Psycho.  Those who loved movies like Very Bad Things, Rushmore,  Election, and Pulp Fiction will really enjoy this movie.",962582400,2,1812,4.593059936908517
70717,5,0783243499,"if you feel that life has not yet begun for you kids out there, here's your first reason for living.  AMERICAN PSYCHO is possibly the most stimulating film i have ever seen.  it is set in the best year, 1985, and  accompanied by great music (new order, genesis, etc), sex, drugs, money,  and best of all-murder.  not only is this the ultimate cult classic novel,  christian bale could very well be THE actor of the 21st century.  i am  completely smitten with this video, this book, this tragically keen man,  this phenomenon.  so all you kids run out and get this video, you will  learn to live, and you will love life like you have never imagined  possible.  you can thank christian's performance for this experience.",962236800,,719,4.611111111111111
70718,5,0783243499,"American Psycho was one of the best films of 1999.  The blood and gore count was suprisingly low in comparison to other horror flicks, but the psychological scares rival that of a great Alfred Hitchcock film.  This is  a great film for those of you out there who prefer mind twisting to mind  splattering.  There are countless references to at least a dozen horror  flicks for all of you horror buffs out there.",961977600,,411,4.561643835616438

7790643,2,0783243499,While I have always loved Christin Bale this movie disappointed as the violence was just dumb.  My son thought it was hysterical with the tie into the 80's culture.  It's all about perspective.  I lived through the 80's...He wasn't born yet!  I never dined at sundry 5 star establishments with such frequency nor had fancy business cards so I suppose its a niche attraction in my mind...,1524009600,,387,4.731343283582089

So many parts were extremely boring with long, no, very very long tedious descriptions of peoples attire or bands and musicians and peoples attire, peoples attire, and peoples attire. OBer and over again. bORING. I know this style of writing has a purpose In trying to make you feel like you're in the mind of the OCD character, but instead of being interesting, it made for a lot of wasted boring pages. I literally skipped through the book. And there is nothing at all redeeming about this main character either. He is just heartlessly violent and sadistic without even the slightest shred of compassion. A waste of life. Period. Book kinda went nowhere and taught us nothing and moved us now where. Regret buying it. Sad novel or in a good way.",1521936000,,779,4.6521739130434785
