8610191,1,B000XSKDQ0,VICTORY IN THE GULF is a British video & appears to be an episode of a TV series. It is only one hour long & only the last 10 minutes are devoted to the war. The remainder is concerned with the historical background & with footage of British ground forces mucking about. Totally weak ! ! Not even worth the $2.98 postage charge.,1222128000,,328,4.222222222222222
