6410886,4,B00KASQQTQ,"4 stars because the music was so-so and the dance walk was a little awkward. Also, I didn't like that she seemed to slow down at the end of the segments. Not helpful for those wanting a longer workout.
I did the dance walk and kickboxing sections today. And I looked through the other workouts. I have done many of the Walk Away the Pounds DVD's in the past. I try to pick out the ones I think look the best and give some variety.
This one gives some new moves and the ability to customize things is great. Reminds me of ""10 minute solutions,"" which I am also a fan of. I think other reviewers have already done a throrough job explaining the DVD. I'll just say that I would definitely recommend this and think it is well worth the price.",1409097600,9,738,4.204225352112676
6410887,4,B00KASQQTQ,"If you're a walk fan like I have been for over three years, you probably will add this to your collection of DVDs.  I like it that you can program the amount of time and segments that you want, but keep in mind that the 1st and 10th segments are really just the warm-up and cool down, unless you are a beginner.  I did 5 of the segments the first day and I sweated a little but not as much as I usually do.  I track my miles and compete against myself each month on how many I do, so this one takes a bit of thinking to figure out about how many miles I did; I prefer the videos that indicate the number of miles.  Personally, I found doing 5 10-minute segments a bit disjointed and will probably only use this DVD on the days I want a light workout.  I much prefer the Five Mega Miles or the two DVDs with the HIIT training/radio mixes.  If you're a beginner walker, this video would be a good one to start with, but if you're advanced, it won't seem like much of a challenge.",1409097600,91,977,4.010309278350515
6410888,5,B00KASQQTQ,"**DVD Menu**

You will see the following:

- All Mini Walks (104 Minutes) and this can be with music or music only

- Choose One of Leslie's Pre-planned Combinations:
 1. Total Body Walk (53 minutes)
`2. Advanced Walk (32 minutes)
 3. Fun Walk (32 Minutes)
 4. Choose One Mini walk - which will bring you to its own menu page where you can choose one.
 5. Create your own custom walk - which will bring you to its own menu page where you can mix up the combinations. It will also allow you to play music only in whatever you choose. You can even choose the same mini walk twice if you like.

** Experience**

I chose to do all of the walks, which got tedious the more I went. According to my calorie count watch, I burned 846 calories surprisingly. Then again, I was moving for almost two straight whole hours. When I did this the second time, I burned 733.

The All mini walks segment are as follows:

1. Light Walk - According to Leslie, she wants you to use this mini walk as a warm-up. And that's exactly what it felt like. There is no jumping or anything brisk. Again, it feels like a warm-up or gentle walk.

2. Dance Walk - You're not really dancing, but there is cha-chas, and Mambos. There are kicks toward the end but knee-lifts. There is no jumping.

3. Walk, Kick + Jab - First, it starts out slow, and then it gets pretty brisk. You'll do mini squats that almost feel like side steps. You'll turn to the side and do side steps along with jab-cross movement. She also mixes in a kick with your double side steps. That move really took me off guard a bit, but I caught up. You'll also do some back taps while your arms swing forward and back. There is no jumping in this.

4. Tummy Trimmer - It had a slow start and then it picked up in speed. She'll have you do regular skaters, but as you do double side steps, she'll ask you to tack on a skater along with that, which can be a little tricky. There are kicks and the knee lifts come with arms that will rise over your head and come down with your elbow touching to your hip. I really felt those in my core. There are no shifts, twists, or bouncing in this.

5. Short & Sweaty - I was tricked on this mini walk as I assumed it was going to be a lot of jumping, bouncing, shifts, and all those high intensity moves, but all it is, is that you're going at a fast pace. The walk starts off already brisk and then gets brisker. The only hardest move for me was doing those twist side steps that almost make you have to hop.

6. Interval Walk - You will have 3 interval rounds where you start off slow and then she'll have you run up 4, stay in place for 4, and then run back 4. This lasts about 60 seconds.

7. Upper Body - It's pretty much self-explanatory. With almost every move you do, you'll do something with your hands like lateral raises, overhead press, chest press, pushing your hands back when you do kickbacks. One thing I noticed was that there were no knee-lifts.

8. Lower Body - This mini walk got me teeth-gritting becuase she just had to include lunges. Lunges make me feel weird around the knee and ankles. You'll do squats with your feet close together along with other common movements like kicks.

9. Brisk + Sweaty - It's just as the title says. You'll be moving pretty fast but there's no jumping or high intensity movements.

10. Flexibility Walk - This is most definitely, or should be the last mini walk in your customize walk. It's very low-impact and really, probably the best cool down she's had in a long time, because she's not rushing through it.

Now, at the end of of these mini walks, she'll kind of slow it down, but there's no cooldown up for each of them. The Flexibility walk is the walk for cooldowns. She kind of tricked me when at the end of the light walk, she started to breathe in and out with her hands stretched up and coming back. I thought she was going to stretch after that. But she said to keep walking if we're going to another mini walk or skip to flexibility walk for stretch.

***Pros***

1. The music is pretty leveled out. I could hear her very well as well as the music at the same time. So, this is not a DVD where you can hardly hear her, or can't hear the music at all.

2. The music itself is pretty decent. It kind of reminds of a trance dance club just a bit. But it has a decent beat. There was one I really liked in the lower body mini walk.

3. She gives one healthy tip in each of her mini walks. The one I loved the most was when she said it is very expensive to be unhealthy. And she's right. You don't want to visit the hospital all the time. Exercise and eat right, and your body will take care of you in return.

4. Nobody on the set was annoying. I already know three of them, such as Nick from from Walk it off in 30 days, Tina from Walk to the Hits, and Nikki from her various DVDs back in 2012. So, there's only one new one there on the set and she moves with fire, almost motivating you to give your best. But there were a lot of powerful smiles. Nick has the best smile.

***Cons***

1. Leslie does get off step a lot. Sometimes even when a scene goes to another and then back to her, she's on a different step.

2. Sometimes I've noticed they were not quite correlated with the beat, as if whoever put the DVD together kind of had a little botch in the audio. So, I'd be going to the original beat she had me on, but all of the sudden, they were either slow or fast for a few seconds.

**Neutral**

1. There is no time clock. But all should be 10 minutes. So, you have an idea of how long they are.

2. I've noticed people have said in the past that she's pretty loud or talks too much. Sometimes her laughs can be exaggerated, but here, she's pretty laid back, very gentle.

**other**
I am 154 pounds if it helps. So, if you're around my size, you can definitely get this done. My mother is in her early 50's and has lost around 10 pounds doing Leslie DVDs. Leslie has helped me lose 11 pounds so far. So, the stuff works. If you have questions, please ask. I'm connected to my email daily.

Overall, I think the best part about this DVD is just that you have more power and options to set up your workout out the way you want it. If you're just too tired, pick out gentle walks. If you want a challenge, you can even pick the toughest mini walks.",1409011200,395,6288,4.139687756778964
6410889,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Just delivered today.  What is different is that there are 10 10min segments to play thru, mix, match or preselected subsets.  Unlike other Leslie DVDs I've done, there's not the emphasis on ""you've done a mile"" but a lot of variety to keep things interesting.  This DVD is good for anyone new to Leslie's method but also a nice change for tried and true fans.  No props are used.  All segments have a small group, are upbeat, but not manic.  A nice balance and and great addition to anyone's collection.",1409011200,,504,4.544444444444444
6410890,4,B00KASQQTQ,"I was really looking forward to this DVD. It arrived in the mail and I popped it in the DVD player. What disappoints me the most is the lack of appropriate cues regarding when to do a new ""step"" (knee ups, side steps, etc.).  In most of the other DVDs, she lets us know what the next step will be and then counts down ""four, three, two, and one"" and then the next step begins. In the very first walk, the one that she says is the ""warm up"" walk, there are several times where she just says ""okay right here guys"" and the new step begins. It's just not as smooth of a transition.

The set is nice with a view of a beach through the open windows. It definitely does not distract a person. You have the option for the voice instruction and music or just the music.

You can play all 10 of the walks, choose from some pre-defined combinations, or you can build your own combination.

I started out with three stars since that definition is ""It's okay."" but that didn't seem right. To me, four stars is more my definition of ""I think it is okay but you might love it.""  Personally, I think I'll stick with her Express Walk series.

Edited to add: There isn't a cool-off segment to choose. I think it would be great to have the 10 separate walks PLUS a cool-down that goes through the stretches. I know most people who have done Leslie's (or anyone's) DVDs already knows the basics, but I guess I prefer to have someone lead me through this.",1409011200,45,1435,4.238095238095238

I like that the segments are measured in minutes and not miles, and I love how I can create my own workout simply by utilizing the tool on the menu bar. I tend to mix/match her other DVDs in order to break up the monotony, and this is by far my favorite feature. Note: I'm pretty sure this menu is only available on DVD according to other reviews I've read, so it's worth it to wait a few days for the DVD to arrive.",1527552000,,517,3.980769230769231

6410908,5,B00KASQQTQ,I love that this Dvd let's you rearrange the 10 min. segments however you wish. It includes a warmup walk and a cool down walk.

6410917,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I have to give Leslie Sansone props for creating a workout DVD that is really body transforming.  I like that I can pick and choose from 10 different 10-minute routines.  I usually do 40 minutes total, including the warm up (Light Walk) and cool down (Flexibility Walk) sets.  I sweat, pant for breath, and have felt a big difference in my core in just a few weeks.  I have older LS DVDs from 10 years ago or so, and her constant chattering and cackling laugh just drove me crazy.  With the Mix & Match Blasters DVD I have the option to mute her but still hear the music (which helps me stay on beat).  That's usually how I do it; problem solved.  This DVD is worth way more than what I paid for it... Glad I gave her another try after maybe 6-7 years of putting the previous DVDs into storage.",1509667200,3,794,4.218543046357616

6410926,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This DVD is made up of 10 different mini-walks which are each 10 minutes long. What I like about this is that you can customize it based, not only on how much time you want to exercise, but also on which ones you want to do. Each workout is slightly different from the others, but all of Leslies signature moves are in them so it is easy to follow along.

I have been using this DVD for a full workout which has been doing between six and eight of the segments depending on how much time I have to put into them. The other day I did a strength training DVD but felt like I needed some additional cardio so I popped this DVD in and just did two segments. It was then that I appreciated being able to utilize it for a mini walks.

This DVD is good for beginners since the two segments for a warm up and cool down could also be used as a standalone beginner workout. As with most of Leslies workouts, you can adjust them to your skill level.

This one is going into my permanent collection.",1501113600,,987,4.103626943005182

Don't think at 10 minutes each you won't get a good workout, some of them are quite intense, like legs (lunges anyone?)! I love all her walks.

I liked the system before because of the simple moves and how easily the walk could be modified to your fitness level.  With the newer DVDs, I love the system because you still have the benefits of the original walking plan, but can now customize your walks to fit the time you have available that day. I don't get bored because I have a different walk each day!  It's a great ""no excuses"" workout for me!",1497571200,,566,4.413461538461538

I have lost 16.5 pounds so far using a few different Leslie dvds and eating right and taking a 30 minute walks on most week nights when I can. i do like this one because it splits up the segments into 10 minute sessions and thinking of it that way makes it seem to go faster for me. I will also say Leslie is also slightly annoying at times to me. But it's nothing I cant handle. I'm certain dvds you can choose the option to walk with just music but I do not really like to do that because then I do not know what's coming next and I get slightly behind for a second. Other than that I feel like it is a good work out for me. If you aren't sure just try it. They are relatively inexpensive to buy the dvds.,1496016000,,854,3.8579545454545454

6410948,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I have been walking with Leslie for a very long time. normally I tend to go for her older ones but this newer one has become my overnight favorite! It has the usual 4 basic steps, good upbeat music, lovely set and I love the 4 walkers ( 3 are from previous LS walks). I love this one because you can make it as long or as short of a workout as you want. some days you might not have a lot of time but doing a ten minute segment can go along way even if its just a mental thing that you did something that day! I read some people say that it wasn't intense enough for them. well I believe that is all on the person working out. If you want to go high intensity, lift your knees higher or kick higher or pump those arms! Maybe you need to keep it low impact ( like myself) and Leslie  will remind you ( as in many of her workouts) modify to YOUR needs. don't lift as high, or take out arms. I just don't see myself getting bored anytime soon with this one. Its a good pick!",1486339200,,971,3.879396984924623

6410956,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I'm a 68 year old woman who recently retired from the ""corporate world"".  I'm now working from home setting up an online business to supplement my retirement income.  This type of work requires a lot of sitting at a computer so I looked for an exercise program that I could do at home that would get me up and keep me moving throughout the day (good for my arthritis).  I ran across this ""mini walks"" tape from Leslie so decided to give it a try.  I am sure glad that I did.  The10 minute ""lite walk"" is very easy to do, is low impact, and can be done multiple times a day without stress to the body (important for us older folks).  So now, every time when I sit down to work, I set a timer for 60 minutes (every 60 minutes thereafter).  When it goes off, I get up and do the 10 minute ""lite walk"" to get my muscles moving, blood flowing, and to refresh my brain.  When I really want to get the old heart pumping (usually 3-4 days a week), I create a custom walk of 3 or 4 ten minute walks (very easy and quick to do).  The best part, I can change up the ""stringed together"" walks so it doesn't get boring.  Thanks Leslie for yet another GREAT product.",1483056000,,1152,4.08

Also, anyone can do 10 minutes so it provides an extra carrot if you find something difficult. It will be over soon! I usually do the first 10 minute section (the warm-up), and pick three other segments, then end with the final flexibility segment. I vary the 3 selected in the middle. So far it has kept my interest.",1474243200,,402,4.52054794520548
6410968,4,B00KASQQTQ,"Leslie Sansone comes through with a multiple walking program that you can tailor to your specific likes or needs.  I enjoy using the custom walk option in which I can pick the walks I want to do.  Each ""walk"" is 10 minutes long.  If you do it the way I do, you can usually choose the warm up walk (10 minutes), another 10 minute walk for your brisk segment, and the cool down/flexibility walk (10 minutes) which includes your stretches.  I particularly like the brisk/steady, short/sweaty, tummy trimmer, and sometimes the interval.  Leslie will also give you a healthy lifestyle tip/hint during each walk segment.  Of course, you will hear the same tip if you play the same segment.  The tips are good common sense.  I am just having trouble with the segments that include movements that I am not so good at (like the dance one) and tend toward not doing those.  You can also play your walk segments with or without the instruction and just with the music.  That will appeal to some especially if you no longer feel you need the instruction.  You can make custom walks of any length or use one of her three walks she put together.  I suggest you watch some before just going into it.  I use this a lot with wonderful results.",1473897600,2,1226,4.493212669683258

The DVD does not offer a guide to her exercise moves (this would help mature walkers). At the beginning, there is a disclaimer advising users to seek a health care provider's approval before starting, this is good. Overall, the DVD does function as a substitute when walking in malls, or outdoors is not an option. The DVD also allows users to create their own custom walk out of the 10 mini-walks.

However, to do that with a download (which is what I purchased)is basically impossible. What I did do, was write down each segments starting time, then fast forward to where I want to go. Not too hard to do but time consuming at first.
Besides that issue, it is the Same Ole Leslie! When you have that morning where you just aren't feeling the desire to work out. Her 10 minute warm up is the solution, you are getting your heart rate up but don't feel as rushed. The cool down segment is about the same. If you just did a work out that you felt exhausted, it feels good to get 10 minutes to cool down. With 10 segments you can't get too bored if you like walking videos.
My Fitbit would show a pretty good activity during this workout. She still has at least 1 segment with the boost so that really gets your heart pumping. For that alone is awesome.",1455667200,3,1154,4.193693693693693
6411026,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I love this tape. It makes it so easy to get up in the morning and walk. Love the short walks, not so overwhelming.",1455667200,,115,3.8333333333333335
6411027,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I LOVE Leslie and have almost all of her DVDs.  I wasn't sure about this one because I like at least a 30-minute workout.  It has two pre-set workouts included (Fun and Advanced) to choose from, or you can pick from the 10-mini walks and make your own workout.  Transition from one to the other is pretty smooth.  She leaves at a medium speed and picks up at a medium speed on almost all the walks.  You do need to select the warm-up and cool-down separately, but it's not that big of a deal.  Her walkers are good too.  Just 4 of them on this DVD.  Definitely recommend for the avid walk-at-home-walker.",1455580800,5,604,4.330357142857143
6411028,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I love this DVD! Upon purchasing, I worried the exercises demonstrated by Leslie would not be advanced enough for me; however, all the exercises are engaging and are designed to work out the body from its torso down to the legs. Also, the DVD gives its users options to mix and match routines and exercise to music, or play it with Leslie giving instructions. My favorite is the fun walk; it actually is fun and the last 10 minutes fly by. I love that I can get in an effective 30-minute or longer exercise routine each day in the privacy of my own home.",1455321600,2,554,4.336538461538462

6411030,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I recently bought Just Walk: Mix and Match Walk Blasters by Leslie Sansone. This is a great exercise DVD. Since buying it I have used it every day. There are ten 10 minute videos that are all different and target different areas of the body. Not only are there 10 minute videos but there are also longer videos that are more intense. I really enjoy being able to pick what different areas of the body I want to work out that day. In addition to being able to pick what part of the body I want to work out I also get to pick the length I want to work out for. By being able to customize the work out to what you want, there are hundreds of different work outs within this one video. There are some great moves in this video. It is easy to follow and easy to keep up with. The women who is the running the work outs who is talking throughout the videos is really nice. She is helpful when it comes to talking through the moves. She is also not pushy in the way she instructs the class. This video is for people who want to work out but not too intensely. Liking to walk helps you enjoy this video a lot. I like to go on walks when it is nice outside so being able to follow a video that includes walking and other moves to work on your whole body is awesome!

I would give this product 5 stars out of 5 because it works perfectly for me. I like to work out with this video because it is easy but not too easy and hard but not too hard. It has a verity of different videos with a verity of intensities. I would recommend this video to anyone who like to walk and wants to do it in the comfort of their own home.",1455062400,,1608,3.962962962962963

Just a few times it didn't seem on beat but it didn't last long, just a small editing issue. I also do not like that they don't play any sound while it is switching from one walk to another when you do multiple walks.

I do wish too it was one continuous workout or had that option, but she does include a few programmed ones on the dvd.  I hope she makes more like this one but make it continuous.  I also like that she seemed more focus in this set.  I get thrown off when she visits and gets a little chatty with the walkers during the workout so I try to be discerning to look for workouts where she does this less and this fit the bill for me in that regard also. I also look for ones that are less repetitive which I know is challenge after all these years and are little more advanced.  The walkers in this are great too.  Friendly and interactive without being over the top.",1448064000,,811,4.062893081761007

I was very out of shape & I was worried that I was going to have a hard time keeping up, but I was very mistaken. I think this was the perfect starting point for someone like me & even though I can do ""harder"" workouts now, I still come back to this one all the time.  It's great for when I don't have a lot of time & need to fit in a quick workout, and I also use it when I want more targeted workouts for my arms, legs or tummy.

6411068,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I love this DVD as it gives you many, many combination choices of short, 10 minute routines that you can do individually or string several together for a customized workout. Leslie Sansone's walk-based workouts are the best by far. She gives great cuing for upcoming step changes and is very upbeat and encouraging. She also includes a thorough cool down at the end which is very important. I can't wait to try some of her other DVD's as well. If you are new to Leslie Sansone workouts, this disc would be a great place to start. The shorter routines and flexibility to pick and choose makes this very user-friendly and helps you to ease back into fitness without the dreaded 'pain and stiffness' that usually comes with it. Highly recommended!",1440806400,2,744,4.730769230769231
6411069,4,B00KASQQTQ,"First of all, this is a terrific video, and for all the reasons mentioned in all the other helpful reviews. I like the flexibility of being able to recombine a series of short workouts.

I don't have a dedicated DVD player. I play the DVDs on my computer and feed the output to my television screen. I recently upgraded my computer to Windows 10, which no longer supports DVD playback through the Windows Media Player. The substitute product, Windows DVD Player, does not recognize the menu creation function at the beginning of the DVD. I can still access the segments sequentially, but it is annoying to pause in between segments to find the next segment I want to see. This problem also manifests on Sansone's Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan, which also has a function allowing the user to choose the number and order of segments.",1440806400,,826,4.657534246575342
6411070,4,B00KASQQTQ,"pros: Love that each walk has a different focus, you can create it for exactly what you want to work on.  For me the workouts while not crazy intense were intense enough that by string 3 or 4 together I got a nice rejuvenating workout.

Cons:  the pre-combined advance workout doesn't include a warm up or a cool down.  I didn't like just getting thrown in without a warm up and the customized doesn't let you select the warm or the cool down to attach to a full workout.  Then it is awkward to have to add those pieces in...

Knowing this I will keep using the video strictly with my own customized choices.  I want to lose 20 lbs...wish me luck!",1440633600,,647,4.254098360655738

6411072,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Awesome work outs.  I love that they are mini walks so that I can fit it into busy days.  Working in an office all day, its good to do one of her mini walks to stretch, burn calories and work the stress of the day off.  Its not just walking in place, she has actual routines that are fun and do-a-ble.  She even introduces dancing and trust me you get a work out.  Leslie gives you the option to do a 10 mt. walk or to keep going to the next one for more intensity.  She is real and genuine in that her main goal is to help us be healthy and fit.  Leslie is very positive and encouraging which helps you to stay on track.  Give her a try, you will not be disappointed and a great price.  Arrived quickly.",1440028800,,704,3.9361702127659575
6411073,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I own several of Leslie Sansones DVDs.  I continue to buy new ones as they become available because I like her approach to exercise and fitness.  She keeps you moving with a few simple steps and anyone can follow her programs regardless of fitness level, experience or age. On this DVD you can choose to do one mini walk, all ten mini walks, or any combination of them, so there is a lot of variety.  I appreciate the flexibility of this DVD.  Some days I only have 10 minutes to exercise and some days I want a longer workout. No additional equipment is necessary for these workouts, but you could probably incorporate stretch bands or hand weights into many of them. I enjoy the healthy living tips that Leslie shares each segment. She reminds us that fitness is more than just exercise. It would be nice if it only took ten minutes a day to look like the ladies working out with Leslie, but you will only get those results if you do several segments daily and are careful about what you eat, too!",1439942400,,999,4.413043478260869

Pros:  I like that I can mix up the workouts and walk 10-106 minutes at a time.  Cons:  I miss the mile markers but I know that is not the goal of this workout.  I agree with other reviewers that it is not as great of a workout as some of her other discs.  I don't like the Walk, Kick, & Jab or the Dance Walk segments.  Conclusion:  Since I've had the disc only a short time, I will continue to play with it and see if I can create a workout that I really enjoy.

Other days I might want a litt l e more of a workout so I might do the interval, dance, and/or brisk and steady. I use this when I am not up for one of my 3 or 4 mile Leslie Sansone DVD,  and sometimes when I want just a bit more. I have also purchased this as a gift for friends who are just starting to walk. I recommend they start with the last segment, the relaxation segment which is about 6 minutes of walking and the rest stretch, then, eventually movery on to the first, no sweat segment, which is ten minutes of light walking.

What makes this dvd especially encouraging is that sometimes a  long workout can seem overwhelming, but doing one short segment on this dvd can encourage you to continue to the next short segment, and before you know it, you have done a long workout in short chunks!

6411097,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I found this to be one of the better walk away the pounds DVDs yet - mainly because you have so many options.  You can build your own work out to suit your mood or your schedule.  I even found the music to be pretty decent during each segment.

This DVD consists of ten 10-minute segments.  Included in those 10 segments is a light walk that you can use by itself if you're really short on time or it can be used as a warm up to any of the other segments.  Then there is a cool down segment that is not as much walking - about half of it is stretching.

The DVD comes with some ""pre made"" workout configurations - but you can make your own workout and even repeat a segment (for example if you want to do the dance walk segment twice - just select it twice).

Another great way to use the DVD is to do several segments broken up during the day.  Want to get 30 minutes in but not all at once?  You can pick different segments and do them throughout the day.  (Or the same segment(s) but during different parts of the day.)

I also found that each segment went by quickly.  Maybe it's just a psychological thing - when you know it's only 10 minutes it doesn't seem too daunting - even if you're doing 3 or 4 at one go.

I made a commitment to do some sort of workout each day - just to get in the habit and some days I only did the first segment - the light walk.  Even though I did that one just about every day (sometimes it was all I did or it was the warm up before other segments) I never got bored with it.

Again, I highly recommend this one.  You can come up with so many different combinations so you're mixing it up each time (great for not letting your muscles get complacent or your mind from getting bored).",1436227200,,1719,4.0265486725663715

They're not high impact so if jarring aerobics isn't for you,  her videos are.
Also, if  you're just starting out, and are as out of shape as I've become,
these videos are easy to adjust your movements to slow your heart rate back down.
I recommend using Sansone's videos in combination with other aerobic videos,
free weights and resistence bands for at home cross training.",1434844800,2,455,4.675

Leslie, as always, is encouraging and gives good instructions throughout.  The separate toning sections give some options in addition to walking.

I love the 10-minute segments, the moves are varied, there's a punch and kick segment, all areas of the body are covered, and one can either choose which areas to work or go with the 20, 30 or 40 minutes sessions as arranged.  The cool down and stretch session at the end (flexibility walk) is the best of any I've done.  Two small glitches: not crazy about the music (more a pace setting than music, really) and they apparently changed the order between recording and editing the final ""cut,"" because the ""health tips"" numbers make no sense, and sometimes she refers to a session as completed when it hasn't yet begun.  Each session is self-contained, however, so it really doesn't matter what number she gives it.  This one will renew my motivation for months.",1432857600,,851,4.684563758389261

Keeps my blood pumping and gives me some light exercise through out the day.

There are several segments I combine often and enough other segments that I can  add on or switch up, so it does not get boring. I am very happy with this DVD and I have many others of Leslie's.

The Amazon Instant Video format just DOESN'T work for this workout with it's 'choose and mix your segments' segments. There's no menu to choose what segments you want, and no 'next segment' button to jump to the one you want. The result is to guess and fiddle while you're walking in place, or have your heart rate drop while you try to find the next segment faster.

6411181,4,B00KASQQTQ,"I like the different variety of 10 minute workouts.  The first one is a great ""break"" from sitting at your desk and is only 10 minutes long. I usually use 2 or 3 as a workout and enjoy changing the routine.  I have other workouts that allow you to ""pick"" your options and I am happy that she has moved to that in this DVD.",1425945600,,322,3.9384615384615387

6411183,5,B00KASQQTQ,I have been walking with Leslie for 10 years now and this is by far my favorite video of hers. I love that I can get in a quick 10 minutes or can mix and match for longer workout! So many to choose from and they never get boring. Music is better. Love that there is a tip at the end of each segment.,1425600000,,299,3.6875

6411189,5,B00KASQQTQ,Great DVD.  Love Amazon !,1425168000,,25,4.0
6411190,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Love this DVD!  There are 10 different 10 minute walks, from a very light ""no sweat"" one to a ""flexibility walk"" which is mostly stretching.  There  are 3 pre-programmed options, or you can create your own.  I like being able to mix and match, and then just add the flexibility walk to ensure I am stretching at the end.

This is a great way to sneak in extra exercise when you don't have a ton of time but want to do *something.*  Every little bit of extra exercise helps out, and I think this was a great idea on Leslie's part.",1425168000,,529,4.188118811881188
6411191,5,B00KASQQTQ,The work outs are great. It is completely balanced around walking and there are several exercises to choose from. Some of the exercises are a bit advanced as far as speed is required but you can always build up to those as you advance in your exercises.,1425168000,,253,4.404255319148936
6411192,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I am loving these 10 min segments I can program in any order I wish.  I think I like this 10 minute format better than the mile by mile format. A mile sounds soooo long sometimes, but 10 minutes seems more doable and I sometimes add an extra segment at the end if I have a lot of energy that day. My favorites are ""short & sweaty"" and ""intervals"", but they are all wonderful low impact workouts that are easy to modify if necessary. Great for the ""time challenged"" individual to fit in at any time of day.",1424736000,,505,4.153061224489796

6411195,5,B00KASQQTQ,I have about a dozen Leslie Sansone DVDs and this one is my favorite by far. This DVD provides a good variety of walking speeds and styles as well as routines that work specific body parts in a more concentrated way. I also like the fact that you can work out for as little as 10 minutes at a time or add 10 minute increments to fill the time you have available.,1424649600,,362,4.041666666666667
6411196,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I love this little DVD.  The workouts are typical Leslie Sansone in some ways, but she also throws in some variations.  The segments are just right.  Each is 10 minutes and can be put together in any order you like.  There are also a couple of ""premixes"" that you can choose, and of course, there is an option to do the whole thing.  I found the segment builder to be easy to use.  The Easy walk (considered the warm up segment) is just perfect to a little pick-me-up any time you need a little movement but don't want to get sweaty.",1424649600,,533,4.227722772277228

6411201,5,B00KASQQTQ,My favorite walking DVD to date. The variety of 10 minute segments offers different ways to achieve fitness goals. I like being able to customize my walk to the amount of time and the type of walks I want to take each time I pop this in the DVD player.,1424476800,,252,4.06

I do like Leslie Sansone's Walk Aerobics, and this one is fun.",1424217600,,191,3.75
6411208,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Love it.  I like the options, and being able to play music only, mixing and matching, and being able to even just do ten minutes to do SOMETHING.  There are no excuses not to do something in a day! :)",1424131200,,200,3.975

6411221,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I didn't think Leslie Sansone could best the walking work-out DVDs of hers that I already own and use every other day.  I was wrong.  I love, love, love this customizable DVD.  I've enjoyed all ten of the mini-walks now.  It's fun to mix-and-match to change my work-out by time and intensity.  The segments blend easily.  You just keep walking for about thirty seconds and you're in the next segment.  Each ten-minute workout segment goes quickly.  I like that it goes in minutes and not miles.  Time flies for me that way!  I hope that Leslie comes out with more customizable DVDS.  She's topped herself with this one!",1423440000,,619,4.638888888888889

6411225,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I love this one! I would say it's my favorite Leslie DVD.  I really like how I can customize my workout without having to skip through the whole DVD. The DVD is great for beginners or a light day for intermediates. If you are more advanced you make the moves big, if you can't move as much, just make the moves small.",1423180800,,317,4.112903225806452
6411226,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This is by far my favorite Leslie Sansone dvd.  These little mini walks are awesome.  You can do one - or as many as you want.  You can combine them into a custom workout or choose a few workouts she has put together.  I have done interval walk a few times - that is an incredible workout.  She really adds some different things to spice up these little walks.  As always, the moves are very easy to follow and can be adjusted for different fitness levels.  One nice feature is you can mute the voice on them so you still get the music for the beat, but don't have to listen to her non-stop chatter and laugh, which can get very annoying after awhile.  I can't imagine anyone would be disappointed with this video, whether you are just starting out or a seasoned walker.",1423094400,,770,4.298611111111111
6411227,5,B00KASQQTQ,I love this workout DVD! There are so many different options for a workout.,1423094400,,75,4.428571428571429
6411228,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This is easily one of her best workout DVDs, simply because of the choice factor. I can choose how long, which ones, and it never gets boring! Most workouts give you a couple of workouts to choose from but the variety is not enough to keep you hooked for long so you end up jumping from DVD to DVD trying to keep yourself from getting bored. Not so with this one! For one thing, the length alone keeps you paying attention and before you know it you're onto the next one--or out walking the dog if you don't have time, which is another thing I love about it. I juggle a full-time job, a German Shepherd puppy, and workouts.(Those of you with shepherds, or even puppies, know what I'm talking about!) And long workouts aren't really an option for me, so I'm really grateful that this one came to my attention.",1423094400,,808,4.357615894039735

6411231,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I have lost count of how many of Leslie's dvds I have, but I love them all.  I must admit that this one is my new favorite because you can pick and choose from the different walks, changing up the routine every time.  I recommend her dvds to everyone who wants to know how I lost weight.
I look forward to her next one!
Keep the coming Leslie!",1422921600,,343,4.029411764705882
6411232,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Fun and flexible.  Due to illness I stopped working out for a bit, so I wanted to ease my way back in.  I loved the flexibility this work out allows, so it can be adjusted for the time you have.  It gets your body and blood pumping.  And I think Nick is cute so I find it entertaining to watch his brisk stance with each mini-workout.  Now that I'm getting back to my routine work outs.  This is a great active rest day or a warm up prior to any type of lifting or plyo work out.  I admit, I was shocked how much I enjoyed this DVD.  I also wear a fitbit, so it tracks 1,000-1,300 every 10 minutes, which is impressive, considering my more strenuous work outs only clock 500 steps in 30 minutes of lifting/squats/jumping jacks.  And since I'm in competition with who can walk more steps weekly (with my family), I tend to love this to add up my steps:)",1422748800,4,852,4.146341463414634
6411233,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This is my most favorite video that I've gotten from Leslie so far and I have almost every video she has made. I LOVE the 10 min segments. It makes exercising go fast and it is so much fun. With the 10 min segments, it seems like you just got started and the 10 min is done. I always do 3 segments together but it still goes really fast.",1422748800,,337,3.898550724637681
6411234,5,B00KASQQTQ,I have been working out since last April. One of the first videos that I used was a Leslie Sansone video.  I have really come to love these videos.  I received this one in  the mail yesterday and have tried all of the walks on it.  This is definitely my new favorite.  The walks go by so quickly and it is good for beginners or more advanced walkers.,1422662400,,350,4.088235294117647

6411240,5,B00KASQQTQ,I have no problem fast forwarding to the start of each section. I just took the time to watch and find out where each one starts and then fast forward to the ones I want each day.

6411242,5,B00KASQQTQ,"For the price $1.99 if I remember, this can't be beat.

6411247,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This is my favorite Sansone DVD to date.  The workout has already been described by many others so I will not waste time.  I really enjoy that you can customize your routine.  My only criticism is that I think she should have included two ten minute weight lifting segments.  One that works on upper body firming and strength and the other on the lower body and no walking on these segments.  I must add just one more criticism:  she states that you can use weights on her upper body walk, but I find that is not a good idea.  She does her arm movements too fast.  When you lift weights, you should be mindful of your movements and go slower.",1421712000,,642,4.291666666666667
6411248,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I have really enjoyed this DVD, I love that you can pick which walk's you want to do for that day, and target what your wanting to target, but I also love Leslie's spirit and the relationship she has with her walker's, she make's it so much funner to exercise. I love that she incorporated new move's in the DVD, and that in each walk she gave a healthy tip. Weather your a long time walker with Leslie, or thinking about purchasing her DVD's, I would highly recommend this DVD!",1421625600,,478,4.322222222222222
6411249,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This DVD is, by far, my favorite of all Leslie Sansone DVDs. It can get pretty boring doing her various mile walks regularly. With this DVD, you can mix and match different workouts and never get bored. I tend to do my favorite workouts a couple of times in one session. I also usually skip the warm-up and cool-down so that I'm getting a solid workout the whole time. She should continue making DVDs in this format.  It's great!",1421625600,,429,4.430379746835443
6411250,1,B00KASQQTQ,"This might be a great DVD, but it's terrible as an Amazon download. There are no menu options to mix/match workouts, which defeats the purpose of this program. I may like it as a DVD, but for now, I'm disappointed.",1421539200,7,214,4.375
6411251,4,B00KASQQTQ,I am a college student and find the 10 minute warmup very useful for getting my head into focus after long breaks between classes.  Just tje right amount of pick me up to get me through my next class.,1421452800,,200,4.128205128205129
6411252,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I have many of Leslie's DVDS so when I received this I couldn't wait to try it out.  It did not disappoint!  I only did one workout from this so far, the advanced walk, and let me tell you, it is some workout!  I was sweaty in no time at all and the time went so fast.  It is broken down into three 10 minute segments and the time went so fast I could easily have done another segment or two.  Another good thing about this DVD is you can create your own workouts by picking the 10 minute segments you want to do.  I'm going to try that tomorrow.  I also like that the group is small and they are all good, not a distracting one in the bunch as in some of her other workout DVDs.  Great buy and I am actually looking forward to tomorrow's workout (maybe even tonight!)",1421366400,,768,4.006578947368421
6411253,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I have many of Leslie's walking CDs.  This is now my absolute all time favorite.  You simply can not get bored with this mix and match your mood and need product.  No matter how I feel, I can fit at least the easy walk into my day.  And, the rest are great fun and a reliable aerobic session.  If you have never tried a Leslie video, buy this. If like me you are already a fan, you will not be disappointed.",1421193600,,407,3.9753086419753085
6411254,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Let me start by saying I purchased the digital version. The actual workouts are great. It is ALL new content as opposed to her last compilation type segmented walks which were older walks re-packaged together. The 10 minute mini-walks are great, each has a different style with different moves/pace/intensity/focus. Leslie gives solid instruction as always, but she also give life/health tips throughout all the segments which gives it a cohesive feel, since you will be doing them all at some point. There is a warm up and cool down style walk at the beginning and the end, both 10 minutes each and for a beginner you could easily just do those to start. For me psychologically thinking ""it's only 10 minutes"" means I am more apt to do it every day, and once I've started lets face it its probably going to be more than just 10min, but something is better than nothing. That is the beauty of this program she designed. There is a LOT of content here, almost TWO HOURS. For LESS than a latte on the digital version of a NEW workout it was a no brainer purchase. All of that being said, there is no menu, no navigation AT ALL. You cannot mix+match easily, you have to wait and fast forward to the right points where each segment begins. It can be frustrating, and if you plan on doing this daily you may want to invest in the actual DVD for the navigation alone.",1421193600,,1361,4.491935483870968
6411255,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This is currently my favorite workout DVD!  I have increased my workout time!  I love the 'multiple choice' segments.  Always starting with the first one - light walk, and always ending with the last one - flexibility walk.  I also choose another segment in between, sometimes two more!  I am consistently exercising daily for at least 30 minutes!  After recovering from an medical issue last year, it was difficult to get back into exercise, so I started slow and easy with 1 mile routines a few days a week.  I gradually built up to more days and for the past few months have been consistent with this DVD for longer workout time everyday!  (I rarely take a day off.)  If I have a bad pain somewhere, I either take it easy the next day or take a day off.  But, the aches and pains have reduced a lot!  Probably because my muscles are getting stronger and more toned!  I use a natural pain cream to help me with that issue, as well.  I enjoy working out now!  Leslie Sansone DVD's are my all time favorite workout regiment!  I still need to lose more weight and 2015 is going to be it!",1421107200,,1086,4.333333333333333
6411256,5,B00KASQQTQ,"4-25-15 - I'm revising my first review...... Decided I didn't give it a chance so started it again and absolutely love it now. I mix and match 5 or 6 of the 10 minute segments and then end with the #10 Flex and stretch for another segment to calm things down and WOW, I get a fabulous workout and do this 4 x a week. It's the best!!

First review...I have been a fan of Leslie Sansone for years and have quite a few of her dvds, which I use daily, and I was disappointed in this one. Got it on 1-16-15 and was very excited to get started and began at the beginning because I wanted to do all the segments. This is definitely for a beginner/maybe intermediate person who wants to start her program. I didn't sweat and will probably put this aside or give it away. I'm 70 and really wanted do sweat. My favorite so far is the 30 Burn 30 so was hoping for something along that line but even better.",1420934400,2,895,4.0852272727272725
6411257,5,B00KASQQTQ,"The best from Leslie Sansone so far!  This has the option to create your own custom workout.  There are 10 to choose from with the option to play with music only or to listen to Leslie's conversation with the music.  Since I use this almost daily, I tire of the talking soon after purchase.  The option to use music only is better.  The workouts are easy to learn.  I would recommend this highly!",1420848000,7,396,4.3561643835616435
6411258,5,B00KASQQTQ,Leslie is good at what she does and does not disappoint! She makes getting exercise fun.,1420848000,2,88,4.5625
6411259,5,B00KASQQTQ,I love Leslie's other walking videos but this is the best  I love that the videos are broken into 10 minute segments that allow me to mix it up!,1420848000,,144,3.9655172413793105
6411260,2,B00KASQQTQ,The short workouts got boring and tedious. Again it felt like it was for beginners. Even the speed interval segment was not challenging.,1420675200,2,136,4.956521739130435
6411261,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Just right. Both my husband and I have tried the first mini walk. Lots of variety here. I will be looking forward to trying some of the others.
I can understand everything she says. It was taped in a nice, bright studio with a support cast. (Nice looking but realistic.) Easy to adapt to your level. I did the first one and got my heart rate up. Will be going back to these. I appreciate the variety since her ""Walk Away the Pounds"" can get a bit boring day after day.
Note: I recently had a hip replacement and found that I can easily do these exercises. They are low impact (no jumping) but still get the results. Also there are no weighted balls for this one but it does have some nice arm lifts to get your heart rate up.",1420675200,,725,4.148936170212766
6411262,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I am very happy with my purchase.  I find that this exercise program is far easier to stick with than any other exercise I've tried.  I like it so much that I wish we'd had this instead of what we did have when I was in school going through P.E. classes (it might have made me care about fitness more).  All of her walkers are awesome, though Nick is my favorite (he seems so cheesily happy that it makes me happy).  The walking is actual exercise, but it doesn't make me feel like I'm killing myself so it's far more motivating to do.  I also really like that I can mix and match the mini-walks; I'm someone who can get bored easily with the same routine so being able to create my own every time makes it more engaging for me.  While her cuing can be a little short-notice sometimes, I find that it's really not that big of an issue.  Also, sometimes the music can be delayed in starting/off, but again I find the benefits vastly outweigh any cons.  Her exercising actually makes me want to try her other dvds, which is a first for any exercise program for me!",1420588800,14,1062,4.248756218905473
6411263,4,B00KASQQTQ,nice to have available,1420588800,,22,4.75
6411264,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This is one of my favorites.  I'm a fan of Leslie and have just about all her workouts.  They're all slightly different so I don't get bored and feel as though I'm switching it up to challenge my body.

I'm a regular walker and am always looking for a challenge.  I did the entire workout all the way through and loved it.  I like that I can do shorter workouts if I have less time, or do the longer workout for a super sweaty workout.

I'd like to see more of these types of workouts.",1420502400,4,485,4.052631578947368
6411265,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I love these walking programs. This one is really great because there is a variety of 10 different short 10 minute walks. So you can choose one for a quick walking boost, choose a couple of programs Leslie has provided, or make your own! The programs work on different parts of the body so you can focus on what you want to work out for that day. I'm completely satisfied with this program!!",1420416000,,391,4.36986301369863
6411266,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I purchased the Amazon Instant Video version of this instead of the DVD. It was the best $1.99 I have ever spent. It is true that there is no menu for you to pick the exercises, however, the exercises are all about 10 minutes long so it is not challenging to fast forward to the exercise that you'd like to try. I don't even bother with the cool down exercise at the end; I just repeat the first exercise.

The exercises are all about 10 minutes. This is perfect. If you are tired one day, but have to exercise, then just do the first exercise. If you are time crunched, split up the exercises and do 10 minutes at a time. Try to get to thirty minutes per day. It doesn't have to be thirty minutes straight. Even if you only get 10 minutes, it is better than 0 minutes.

Leslie is very encouraging. I have tried other exercise videos, but I have yet to find anyone with her charisma. I own two of her DVDS. This one is my favorite due to the flexibility of it. All of the moves are very easy. There are no complicated dance moves, which is great for people like me with absolutely no coordination. Leslie is very supportive the entire time. You can modify the moves and do them a bit smaller, or like she says, you can sit into it and it definitely makes the exercise more intense.

I strongly recommend this for EVERYONE. There really is something here for everyone and I love this video.",1420329600,5,1389,4.253787878787879
6411267,4,B00KASQQTQ,I purchased the digital version of this workout. Unfortunately there isn't a way to customize the workout or select the different sections so that's why I gave it four stars. I do the workout in it's entirety which comes out to be 1 hour and 45 minutes divided into 10 sections. I guess you could stop and resume where you left off since Amazon does remember your place if that's to long for you. There are a few new moves but they are simple and easy enough to do. I have several of Leslie Sansone's dvds and she has the same great energy in this dvd. Overall I love the workout and the new moves add something nice to the routine.,1420329600,2,632,4.231404958677686
6411268,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Great variety and the mix and match allows you to create your own walks. I really like the walk, kick, and jab and the interval walk. I am not sure why some are complaining about lack of warm up and cool down when Leslie says to use the first walk as the warm up walk and the flexibility walk as the cool down. I'm male and in shape, nice to see she has a guy working out with her in this DVD. Great cardio and fun.",1420243200,2,415,3.8372093023255816
6411269,5,B00KASQQTQ,Love all of Leslie's walks! This one is awesome!,1420156800,,48,4.444444444444445
6411270,4,B00KASQQTQ,"I really like that you can choose your segments, but the big bummer is that there is no cool down or warm up.  Leslie talks about going to ""section 10"" for the cool down, and there is no section 10.",1420156800,,198,3.95
6411271,4,B00KASQQTQ,I like some of the walks.  Some are too slow.  Over all it's a nice change because of the variety.,1420156800,,98,3.85

6411274,5,B00KASQQTQ,Love it! Mix Match Walk Blasters gives you the opportunity to make your 'walk-out' what you need it to be.,1420070400,,106,4.35
6411275,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This is a great DVD for you if you are having a hard time fitting in your daily walk. I like that there are 10 different options, and you can mix it up. Each walk is different, so you don't get bored. This DVD offers a custom walk, a total body walk, an advanced walk, and a fun walk. When you do one of Leslie's selected walk's, she doesn't always include the warm up or cool down--you have to fast forward to them. Also, on the total body walk--she does the Lower body, upper body, and then the tummy trimmer. I like doing the tummy trimmer first because your legs get tired after you do the lower body blast. I am a huge fan of Leslie Sansone and have had great success with weight loss (50 pounds down and counting). Her walk at home workouts are a great option if you are unable to walk outside.",1419984000,,800,4.134615384615385
6411276,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Love this one! I love how I can mix and match the mini walks. These are also challenging, especially the core workout and the upper/lower body workouts! Fun and challenging - you can't beat it! I've used Leslie Sansone DVDs for many years and this one is a winner!",1419724800,2,264,4.408163265306122
6411277,4,B00KASQQTQ,"Love this workout type!!  No boredom, make more!  Leslie mixes it up and cover the whole body head to toe.  I exercise one 10-minute walk when I have time, or more when I have a lot of time.",1419638400,2,190,3.9473684210526314
6411278,4,B00KASQQTQ,"Got this for Christmas.  I did 4 of the ""walks""--dance, kick/jab, and brisk (I think) and ended with flexibility walk for cool down/stretch.  I like it.  Different enough from the other dvd's yet still familiar enough that you're not tripping over your feet.  It will be a nice switch up from the other dvds.  Lost over 100lbs using Leslie's walk dvds.  They have taken me from walking at a 3.0mph pace at most to jogging on my treadmill or outside at a 5.0mph pace.  Love the ability to make your own walk mix.  Keep em coming Leslie!",1419552000,2,535,4.443298969072165
6411279,5,B00KASQQTQ,Very pleased.,1419465600,,13,6.0
6411280,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Great add to my Leslie collection!  I have walked with Leslie off and on for many years--the first recording I had was a VHS tape shot in her living room; you could see her children playing in the yard through the window.  I walk a minimum of 10,000 steps a day around my work schedule. These 10 minute segments are perfect because I can do as much as I have time for without feeling like I didn't finish.  Yes, I could just stop 10 minutes into a longer workout; maybe it's just me but doing that felt like I was cheating or slacking.  Love the variety and the option to mix and match the segments ahead of time instead of stopping and picking the next one after the previous one finished.  Leslie's DVDs were a prime reason I've been able to meet my step goals and walk off nearly 60 pounds this year.

I find the comments critiquing set decor and the occasional misstep, etc. interesting.  These are not $100 or even $50 DVDs.  I doubt there's room in the production budget to do endless takes or editing to produce a perfect, slick product. I admire Leslie for continuing to develop new ones and keeping them affordable and accessible.  She truly seems to be more committed to helping people get healthy instead of herself wealthy.",1419465600,,1235,4.453333333333333

6411291,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Full disclosure: I have been walking with leslie for years. The basic steps are simple, but also along the way she has added new moves to keep it fresh. Her videos of late have featured a younger cast & we don't see her ""usuals"" anymore~ I don't find this a negative at all. I am in my late 50's & I think the participants inspire you to move a bit more "" full out"". I also like watching how others add their own touches to standard moves. Her speed has increased over the years-which I like, the time between move changes is shorter-which I like. There is more variety in the videos-which I like. This is her first video that doesn't emphasize number of miles, but rather strings together segments of 10 minutes intervals with emphasis on what you have time for that day. You can mix & match as much as you want. Pick what you want for that day.  I like leslie a lot, & prefer her later videos for their speed .....but as always, you can modify to your ability.

6411319,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This was a very enjoyable and energetic video.  The DVD menu can be programmed however you want to arrange your workout.  Want to do the warm up then Dance Walk 3 times?  Go for it.  You can repeat walks throughout your arrangement to suit what you want your workout to be.  The music-only option is here, as well, which I find great once I get through one or two spins with Leslie's voice.
The lower body segment was a bit tough, as they included forward and side lunges.  I grab a chair or something to put a hand on at times, as these can get intense with the numerous reps.  My favorites on this disc are the Dance Walk, Short & Sweaty and the Flexibility Walk (considered the cool-down of the video).
One thing that I also liked here was the cast.  It was 4 energetic walkers (you will recognize three of them from previous videos).  I, personally, prefer this size ""class"" to the larger cast (Walk it Off in 30 as the exception).  I often find one or two people in her videos who are just ""too"" cheery and a bit over the top with the smiling and such - not really the case here.  Smiles and fun, but nothing over the top.
This is a great compilation that can be customized to your liking.  The music is enjoyable, particularly on the segments I listed.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a workout to pair up with Walk it Off in 30 or with the new Walk Off Fat Fast DVDs.",1415664000,,1382,4.2091254752851714

6411322,3,B00KASQQTQ,"Overall, this is a good workout plan. Rather than miles (which is a break from her usual routines), this one gives you short ten minute workouts that vary in where they focus.  Compared to some of her other workouts (5 mega miles or 5 really big miles, for example), this one isn't as challenging.  Advanced walkers might find themselves walking longer for the same intensity of workout versus the other DVDs.  It would be great for beginners, though, just learning the steps and getting into the feel of Leslie's workouts.  The one serious technical downside is buying the instant video versus the DVD. Without the menu, you don't know the segments and can't put together a mix and match workout.  I find I just move the cursor up ten minutes when I want to try something new or not go straight through the workout, but it's still frustrating.",1415318400,5,844,4.675675675675675
6411323,5,B00KASQQTQ,"The first time I watched this I was apprehensive.  I am stuck in routines and not having miles made me skeptical that I would like it.  I know, it seems petty but I get all frazzled when my routines change!

I usually wake up every morning and put an hour and 20 minutes in.  Mostly I do her 5 mega miles each morning (skipping the cool off).  Then at lunch I do one of her Walk to the Hits or walk outside, either way about 3 miles.

I bought this cause it was $2.99 at the time, and I couldn't not add it to my collection at $2.99.

I turned it on one day just to mix it up and fell in love, although there are some parts I usually skip.

Pros:
The music is a great beat for most of the sessions.  I didn't really care for the dance one but overall the music really pumps you up.

I like the 10 minutes.  Again, didn't think I would, but it is nice to change everything every 10 minutes.

Cons:
Leslie gets a little cheesy in this one.  Especially in the punch, kick, jab or whatever that one is.  I couldn't watch it again without an eye roll.  Of course, she mostly gets cheesy with Nick who is pretty cheesy himself (watch walk to the hits, radio remixes!!).

No resistance band (this is sometimes a pro like this morning when I was too tired to do a resistance band).

My favorite is to start at the warm-up, then do the next three which are the brisk, the interval, and the short and sweaty, then do those three again, then cool down for my hour and 20 minutes, although it ended up being about an hour and 25 minutes.  I really like those three and I worked up a good sweat.

I probably won't do this daily, but it is a great addition to my collection of Leslie Sansone.",1414972800,2,1678,4.060975609756097
6411324,4,B00KASQQTQ,"It is a good one, i have it ""downloaded"". And i think this would be a better one to have as a real DVD. Because you can switch to different workouts. And its harder to do, as a download, cause then your fast forwarding/rewinding alot, to get to the correct spot. But the workout are great, as usual.

There are short breaks in between so you can stop where you wish or continue and do the entire workout.  She starts out with a ""no sweat"" 10 minute walk, later on the video has a ""dance walk"" and walk including boxing moves.

6411331,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This is such a great DVD.  The technology allows you to create your own workout from ten 10 minute segments.  They are all fun, especially the dance walk and the walk/kick/jab.  You've got an easy warm up or, if you are an advanced walker, you can start with a segment that has HIIT intervals.

6411333,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I have several Leslie Sansone DVDs and I really enjoy them. Previous favs are 3 Mile Power Walk and Walk to the HIITS Radio Remixes. But I love this one. There are 10 - 10 minute walk options - 1 the warm up and 1 the cool down, but the others are all very different walks with different moves. You can play walks one at a time or there are 3 preset workouts. Total Body Workout is a really great work out at 52 min and includes the warm up and cool down. The other 2 are 32 min, but do not include a cool down/stretch. BUT the best part is you can create your own custom walks!! It's nice to be able to mix and match and choose what you want, in the order you want. You can pick the Lower Body Workout, which is hard work and then go to the Dance Walk which is more fun. You can play each walk/preset walks and your custom walks to listen with Leslie talking or just with the music.

Another feature I love is the ""Light Walk""- which is the warm up - is a ""no sweat"" walk, so you can get in 10 minutes of exercise even if you don't have the extra time to shower and change! One of my big""excuses"" for not exercising is I don't want to get sweaty - no time to shower after, etc. Well, this gives you a 10 minute. no sweat workout!

Love this DVD - Saturday I plan to try to do all 10 walks!",1414108800,,1290,3.882575757575758

6411336,4,B00KASQQTQ,"I bought this exercise DVD when it first came out and since then have been doing various combinations of the 10 minute workouts to see what I like.  I like the 10 minute segments because it does't get boring; I can mix things up a bit more than Leslie's usual workouts.  However, that also makes it harder to judge (unless I am wearing my activity tracker) how far I have gone as I am used to the 15 minutes/mile usual format.

There is a 10 minute warm up walk.  I also like the fact that the cool down (flexibility walk) isn't rushed the way her cool downs and stretches usually are.

You can do one, your own combination of two or more, or one of Leslie's pre-selected combinations of 10 minute segments.  I don't really like the pre-selected combinations too much.  There is an advanced walk where Leslie starts out saying that she hopes you already did a warm up and goes straight into it; surprise!  The other pre-selected combos have warm ups included. Other reviewers have explained the 10 minute segments so I am not going to do it again.

I am finding myself talking back to the rather annoying exclamations made occasionally by Leslie's backup walkers.  Leslie, as usual, can't count and isn't so great at the cues on what is coming next.  Nothing new there.  You can play any of the workouts with music and Leslie talking, or music only.",1413676800,3,1349,4.506172839506172

6411341,5,B00KASQQTQ,I have been walking with Leslie for years. It all started for me with her VHS tapes!  It's the only form of exercise I've really stuck with and enjoyed. I can't say enough about the Mix and Match Walk Blasters. I love it! Rather than buying the DVD I purchased the download version for my IPad. I can take it anywhere. This really comes in handy for me since I am now retired and travel. Although I have many many different Leslie workouts I find myself using this newest one all the time.

6411345,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I love this DVD and the choices Leslie gives you. Her cueing is excellent and very easy to follow. I have many of her tapes and find her so likeable. I used to buy from Charlene Prickett years ago and loved her too, but Leslie's style is very similar and makes you forget you are exercising. If you buy this you won't be sorry. This first mini walk is the warmup and the 10th mini walk is used for the cool down with the stretch. I am in my 60's so I usually only do 4 mini walks at a time. Charlene P. once said I would rather be on the B team for life than the A team for a short period. What she meant by that is killing yourself by doing grueling exercises can only be kept up for a short time in life. Doing Leslie's walking tapes are certainly something you can do for the rest of your life and actually look forward to doing it every day, I sure do. Good on you, Leslie!!",1412899200,6,878,3.938202247191011
6411346,4,B00KASQQTQ,I like the different levels in this walk and being able to customize a walk how you want.  There are good options.

Let me know if anyone of you has this problem too or a solution to it.  strangest thing.,1412899200,,353,4.0
6411347,5,B00KASQQTQ,I have many of Leslie 's walking videos and I was getting bored.  I love this one because you can pick from various mini walks and make your own custom walk.  Even if you only have time for one 10 minute walk it feels like a good workout,1412812800,,237,3.9166666666666665
6411348,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I am a long time (15+ year) fan of Leslie Sansone's In Home Walking program. I got this latest DVD because it had short workouts, a music only option, and the option to create my own workout combinations. I am very pleased with this DVD. I will, however, have to do my own warm up/cool down segments because using the first and last workouts to warm up/cool down takes too much time (10 minutes each) which detracts from the ""short"" workout selling point. To me that is a small point and one that I can easily adapt to make Walk Blasters work for me. After so many years of walking with Leslie, I know how to warm up/cool down without having to follow along. Those of you just starting or those who like to follow along for everything might want to keep that in mind as you consider making your purchase. Add 20 minutes to whichever workout segments you pick to warm up/cool down and you will have the length of time it will take to complete a workout.",1412812800,,952,4.324022346368715

That said. this DVD is by far her best yet. You can workout from 10-100 minutes and choose the order in which the segments are played. I shoot for an hour a day and, because I still work, I do 3-10 minute segments in the morning and 3 more when I get home. This program will work for any age as I am 67 with some knee problems and I'm still able to more than keep up. The tips she gives with each segment also help you make good meal choices.

Have been walking with Leslie Sansone DVDs since April of this year and now own four of them. It's just nice to switch up the routines when this is done on a daily basis. There is no timer on these workouts but they all keep to the 10-minute time period. Although they are not termed ""warm-up"" or ""cool-down"", the first and last options are just that respectively. I like the cool down as she adds more stretches and range of motion moves than in any of the other DVDs I have. Happy stepping!",1412208000,,659,4.32258064516129

It is helping me regain energy that is lost to this task.  I was hurt and diagnosed with bursitis earlier this year.  Which got me off track.  But this has really helped to get going again.

I love seeing people from her past walk DVDs in the new ones.  You feel like you're working out with friends (cheezy, I know).  Today I did the whole entire walk, which is one hour and 44ish minutes.  I don't advise this and I probably won't do The entire work out like that again.

6411378,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I'm a huge fan of Leslie and own a good number of her DVDs, but I was looking forward to this one because a) I've done the others so much that they're starting to get old, and b) I love the mix and match format. There's so many options with this DVD--you can do any of the segments you want depending on how much time you have and how difficult you want your workout to be.

My ONLY complaint, and this is a minor one (obviously since I'm still giving this five stars) is that there's no title card to let you know the name of the sequence you're doing. For instance, if I do the 32 minute intense walk, I'd want to know the names of the three segments in the walk. Then, when I want to just mix and match segments, I can say ""oh yeah, Short and Sweaty is the one at the end of the intense walk"" instead of playing Short and Sweaty and realizing that. But again, this is so minor and the workout here is so good that I'm not going to give this DVD any less than five stars.

I really don't see myself getting bored with this one for a long time since there's so much content on here. I DEFINITELY prefer a DVD formatted like this over the ones that just contain 1 30-45 minute walk.",1411689600,,1182,4.025531914893617
6411379,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Great for beginners & veteran walkers. The 10 min burst allow new and advance walkers to get their walk on. Beginner walkers can workout to the pace displayed on the screen. Advanced/verteran walkers should bump-up their pace to get an exceptional workout. The greatest part of this workout is you can mix-and-match or customize what you wish to do or you can stick with the preset workouts designed by Leslie on the dvd. Just remember if you customize your workout, it takes 1 & a half segments or burst (as i call it) to equal a mile. So, if you choose to walk 2 miles you would have to customize 3 segments or 3; 10 min burst. I LOVE IT. Leslie also have another create your walk (as i call these two) dvd the 5 Day Ultimate Walk. She has the preset workouts plus you can customize your walk. Basically, if you are new to Leslie Sansone's walk program these are the only 2 dvd's you need, Unless you are like me and love all she does.

I also like the preset workouts .. the only think i really Don't like is the pre set workouts do not have a warm up or a cool down.. at the end of the one i tried today Leslie tells you to go to the cool down walk after the segment ends this requires you to go to the dvd menu and find the cool down walk and start it . it was kind of annoying because it didn't flow with the workout.. it was an interruption to have to get the DVD remote and scroll through the list of workouts just to find the cool down walk.. and i don't think there is a warm up walk at all.. but that wasn't as annoying as the cool down walk look up.. other than that I am pleased with this dvd. lots of variety and easy fun workouts..,1411603200,,836,3.832369942196532

Brilliant idea If you already workout with Leslie, you should absolutely have this video. If you are looking for something new and low impact it's a great way to start.",1411430400,,500,4.273684210526316

6411386,5,B00KASQQTQ,I haven't had too much of a chance to do this one but I'm sure it will meet my expectations.,1411430400,,92,3.65
6411387,5,B00KASQQTQ,Great exercise; you can mix things up so you don't get bored.,1411430400,,61,4.166666666666667
6411388,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This DVD is different from her others it's not miles, but time themed. You can build your own work out by using one or several of the walk modules. It is a great work out.",1411430400,,171,3.914285714285714
6411389,5,B00KASQQTQ,She is so fun to walk with!!,1411344000,,28,3.142857142857143
6411390,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I have several Leslie Sansone dvd's, and this one ranks near the top.  The workout is broken into 10 10-minute segments, which makes for great variety.  Having 10 segments also makes this dvd a great value.  The walkers are having a fun time.  You can do as much or as little exercise as you choose, depending on how much time you have.",1411344000,,336,4.370967741935484
6411391,5,B00KASQQTQ,"This just might be one of the best walking DVDs ever.  You can walk for 10 minutes or blend the ten minute segments in whatever way suits you.  I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to add a walk program to their schedule.  I've walked with Leslie since the days of VHS tapes and I'm sold on this one.  You don't need any fancy equipment to get a good, steady workout.  I use this tape while in my exercise pool and I can really get in a good workout.",1411344000,,448,4.045454545454546
6411392,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Love Leslie Sansone, this video mixes it up, lots to choose from.  You can put together your own workout with her 10 minute videos.  She also gives health tips in every 10 minute segment.  Highly recommend for us over 50 crowd.",1411257600,,227,4.487804878048781
6411393,4,B00KASQQTQ,"This is one of Leslie Sansone's best videos yet.  It gives you a great deal of  flexibility in terms of time.  Sometimes all I have time for is a 10 minute period (or all I can manage is 10 minutes!). Anyone can do these exercises and since she has incorporated 10 routines that you can mix and match, you don't get bored. You can also do as many segments as you like. All of the segments combined give you a workout of 104 minutes. You also don't have to listen to the spoken part, you can exercise just to the music - a plus because the chatter is annoying after a few plays (one of the faults of many exercise videos). The only criticism I have is there is not enough upper body exercise which she used to include in her earlier videos. This may be premature as I have only done 4 of the segments so far.",1411257600,,807,4.094936708860759
6411394,5,B00KASQQTQ,Absolutely love Leslie Sansone & I really like the Mix & Match Walk workouts.,1411171200,,77,4.571428571428571
6411395,5,B00KASQQTQ,I love it!  It is the perfect workout since I can choose according to my time to workout and the areas I want to work on!!,1411084800,,122,3.6923076923076925
6411396,4,B00KASQQTQ,I like the 10 minute segments.  It's good if you only have a few minutes to exercise or you can but a few segments together for times when you have a longer time to exorcise.,1410998400,,174,3.9714285714285715
6411397,5,B00KASQQTQ,This is the best ever I love this DVD; it's fun as well as funny because at certain segments you may laugh at yourself;  I would definitely recommend  for personal use and give as gifts; this is a keeper and a WINNER!!!,1410912000,3,219,4.190476190476191
6411398,4,B00KASQQTQ,Workouts are great but the DVD keeps blacking out????,1410912000,,53,5.0
6411399,4,B00KASQQTQ,"I really like Leslie's mix-match walk blasters, they are fun and short.  However, get the DVD do not buy the instant video on Amazon. I bought the instant video and am disappointed that you can not mix and match the sessions or easily find a session that you want.  I had to watch the whole video and write down the different segments and when they started so I could fast forward to that section on the instant video.",1410912000,9,418,4.346153846153846
6411400,5,B00KASQQTQ,Great video: New routines and 10 minutes in length make it easy to complete a 30 minute or less workout.,1410912000,,104,4.25
6411401,5,B00KASQQTQ,Didn't think I would like this when I first tried it. But I love it so many different workouts you can do.,1410912000,,106,3.8636363636363638
6411402,4,B00KASQQTQ,I like some of the 10 minute walks better than others.  I'd like it if there was a quick warm up and cool down that could be added to each walk.  I don't want to warm up or cool down for 10 minutes each (that's the first and last walk on this DVD).  I like the interval walk the best.,1410652800,,284,3.7
6411403,5,B00KASQQTQ,"Have about 5 of Leslie Sansone's ""Walk"" DVDs.  This is my favorite.  There is way too much talking in most of them and only 2 give option to have music only.  Most of all, I love the 4 people she has working with her on this.",1410480000,,225,3.847826086956522
6411404,4,B00KASQQTQ,I must have 40 of Leslies DVD's.  All different levels.  I have been doing them for over 20 years. I am now 63.  This one is very nice because you can pick which ones and how long. This morning I just did one of the ones that's about 35 minutes.  The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is I do miss the count down or the mile counter on it.  Although knowing that each segment is only 10 minutes I guess is just about the same thing. This DVD is not for an advanced workout enthusiast..It is more for the intermediate.  That being said I think a lot of people would enjoy the variety.  Thank you again Leslie.,1410480000,2,617,4.049586776859504
6411405,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I have several of Leslie Sansone's cds and this one is one of my very favorites. It can be customize every way you want. If you just have little time to excersize,you could still have your workout . I like Leslie Sansone positive energy. She is encouraging and you can follow everything she does at your own pace if you are not experienced walker and still get results.  This cd is well balance and avoids boredom, since you can choose from many excersises targeting different parts of the body or intensity. I also like the choice of walkers accompanying Leslie. I highly recommend this cd for beginners as well as for advanced.",1410393600,,629,4.616071428571429
6411406,5,B00KASQQTQ,Love this new DVD!  You can mix and match the workouts to your own liking  or choose the ones already put together.  Either way its a great workout and lots of fun as usual.,1410393600,,173,4.029411764705882
6411407,5,B00KASQQTQ,I love this DVD. I can exercise as little or as much as I want. It gives you the ability to change your workout which is better for your metabolism. I usually start with a slower walk and then add on more demanding workouts.the fact that they're only 10 minutes each means you don't get bored and you can change up the muscles you use. I would recommend this to beginners and advanced because you can design a good workout for yourself. You also have the option of just listening to the music if you don't want to hear Leslie's instruction.this is my favorite workout DVD.,1410134400,5,572,4.40566037735849
6411408,4,B00KASQQTQ,I do all ten of these as a work out.  It is not as difficult as I would expect and most don't raise a good sweat.  I put this in the category of endurance rather than high intensity.  I have included it in my rotation for that reason.,1410134400,,234,3.8333333333333335
6411409,5,B00KASQQTQ,Another great Leslie Sansone DVD.  I like the short 10 min. segments.  You can do 1 or keep going and do as many 10 min segments that you want.  Each one has a bit of a different 'theme' so they are varied.,1410134400,,206,3.857142857142857
6411410,4,B00KASQQTQ,"I have a bunch of Leslie's videos, and this one is really just ok. There are 10 10-minute segments, which can be mixed and matched as the viewer wants, or the viewer can use one of the pre-mixed compilations.  I did the ""Active Walk"", which wasn't all that active, as far as I was concerned- the ""Dance Walk"" was Ok, but nothing to write home about.  I know some people really like the ""create your own walk"" feature, but I've never been one in love with that feature.  This video would be fine for someone just starting out with exercise, but if you're an advanced walker, then it's something you can do on days when you really don't want to work all that hard.  Oh, and BTW, I HATE whoever they have doing their set design.  It is clearly the same set Leslie has used for several videos (with the staircase on the left side of the screen and the still-unexplained conversation pit off to the right), but it's been painted to look as if the building overlooks a beach- the curtains are even blowing around.  The beach background is so poorly painted that it just makes me angry- like a mural at a so-so Italian restaurant- and the unseen fans blowing the curtains just looks stupid.  I will admit it's a step up from the ""Romper Room"" scheme they used for the two HIIT videos, but barely.

Ok, I have used this video a few times since I wrote the review, and I feel that my initial evaluation was a tad harsher than necessary. I still think the set is stupid, but the segments themselves have actually proven to be surprisingly effective in getting me up and exercising. You see, I usually try to do a Leslie workout in the morning before I leave for work.  Normally, if I oversleep by 20 minutes or so, I would rationalize skipping an entire workout, on the basis that I didn't have the time (yes, I know, I could still do a 15 minute segment, but it's very easy to rationalize my way out of exercise). But now, with the 10 minute segments, the back part of my brain says, ""Get up and do 2 10-minute segments, lazy."" The Interval Walk and the Short and Sweaty segments are PERFECT for those days- it gets me moving at a good clip, and I'm done FAST. Both segments are short enough so that I really don't feel the need to bother with a big warm up, and don't need all that much of a cooldown, either. So I get to oversleep AND get my exercise in, too! Win-win!",1409875200,4,2361,4.29954954954955
6411411,5,B00KASQQTQ,Love it! All kinds of ways to mix it up and easy to create your own workout. Only 10 mins but if you do 5 thats 50 mins of exercise. All of them got my heart rate up too.,1409788800,,170,3.3846153846153846
6411412,4,B00KASQQTQ,"Very good, with lots of combination options or pre-mixed ones.  I wish that Leslie would bring out a DVD like this one, but filmed outdoors in different locations (beach, forest, park, etc).  That would make it the perfect walking DVD.  Are you reading this, Leslie? :)",1409702400,2,269,4.804347826086956
6411413,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I wasn't sure about this DVD at first, but I have MANY of Leslie's DVDs and this one gives a great deal of flexibility in my workout which is quite nice.  I'm still trying out all of the modules, but I have found at least 2-3 mixtures that are fun and good workouts.

Oh, do love that they tried to give an outdoor, beachy feel to the decor, but (and I hate to be picky...) the water doesn't move in the windows - dead giveaway, but still nice set!",1409702400,,448,4.022471910112359
6411414,5,B00KASQQTQ,Leslie Sansone is so cheerful and positive.  She motivates me and makes me see that the little changes can make a big difference.,1409702400,,129,4.608695652173913
6411415,4,B00KASQQTQ,"Just received this today and popped it right into the DVD player. Like how you can custamize the menu.  I did the Light Walk, which is pretty much your warm-up, then chose the Short/Sweaty- it adds speed skaters & double side-step into a speed skater, & I did get sweaty, then closed with the Flexibility Walk- pretty much your cool-down walk. I really enjoyed the walking and Leslie is good as always, but I do have a tendency to be able to tune her out too.  The being able to choose 10 min segments will be a great added choice for my hubby, who has limited time in the morning but gets in a workout.  Granted they are only 10 minutes long, timed on a clock, but I do lkie to be able to see that count-down on the screen.  All in all very satisified with this purchase. =)",1409702400,3,775,4.181208053691275

6411417,5,B00KASQQTQ,"I've been using Leslie's DVDs for about a year and a half to help me lose and maintain my weight.  Over that time, I have tried other people's walking DVDs and I have no hesitation in saying that Leslie Sansone is, BY FAR, the best in the business!  In fact, I would say that if you are interested in building an indoor walking program, don't waste your time or money on any other walking DVD program.  That being said, I have about 10 different LS DVDs.  This particular one is my new favorite.  Just like her previous offering, LS Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan, this DVD contains 10 different walks that you can personally program into whatever combination that you wish.  It is perfect!  I love being able to choose as many different walks as I feel like doing on any given day or, if I am feeling uninspired, the DVD contains some pre-programmed walks selected by Leslie.  Leslie is her usual, talkative, bubbly self which I enjoy but you can turn her off and just run the music if you don't.  Her walkers are young and energetic and will be familiar to others who have other DVDs in the ""Just Walk"" series.  Good job, Leslie and keep them coming!",1409702400,44,1146,4.414285714285715

8656992,4,B00KASQQTQ,I have been walking with Leslie Sansone for about 15 years and I love her! I do like this dvd but am not able to do just a single walk. I have tried several times to do any of the 10 walks but they won't play. Nonetheless I do enjoy the 10 minute segments.,1532995200,,256,3.759259259259259
8656993,5,B00KASQQTQ,Love her videos.  Low impact.  Enjoy the variety on this one,1532995200,,60,4.363636363636363
8656994,5,B00KASQQTQ,"A friend recommended Leslie Sansone's walking programs, and I tried a few of them out on YouTube. I liked them so much that I decided to purchase a DVD. After looking through all of the options, I thought the Mix & Match Walk Blasters would be the best choice for me, and I'm very happy with it.

The review by FashionQueen86 is really detailed about the different walks, and I agree with her about the pros and cons, so I won't bother repeating what is in her review.

I absolutely love that you can build your own customized walk by using the menu to select the mini walks you want, in whatever order you want, and then just play it. It's nice that whatever custom walk you build doesn't go away unless you choose to clear it, so if you have a routine that you want to do each time, you don't have to keep programming it in. (This applies to the DVD version.)

I thought I would like having the option of music only, since sometimes the talking can be a little annoying, and I thought after hearing the same things over and over I might get tired of it. But after trying the ""music only"" option, I don't really like it. It's hard to follow along, and I think the workout seems to go much quicker when you listen to the conversation. So now I just stick with the voice option.

Another thing that is great about this particular DVD is that there are so many different walks, totaling nearly 2 hours. That will make it much less boring than some of the other choices where you would end up doing the same routine over and over.",1531526400,3,1527,4.273356401384083
8656995,5,B00KASQQTQ,Ive been using Leslie Sansons videos for the past couple of years and I love them. You can tone them down or amp them at your own pace. And I really love this workout because its so flexible on time. Only 10 minutes...sure! An hour...why not?!,1531440000,,243,4.304347826086956
8656996,5,B00KASQQTQ,This is one of my favorite of Leslie's DVDs. I love being able to choose my own order of mini walks or just do the whole DVD. I have about 20 or her walking DVDs and I really like the variety on this one.,1529712000,,204,3.659090909090909
