8072515,5,B000A2IP8C,"I think this is one of the best, most exciting film versions of Mary Higgins Clark's thrillers. Lisa Monroe (Gabrielle Anwar) returns to her home town of Milford after a spell away as a detective in Detroit. She was appointed by the now town sheriff, Lt. Joe O'Conner (Max Martini).  Lisa, and others in the town, are haunted by the death of her school friend Jenny Rand (Andrea Runge) for which they feel partly responsible. Jenny went off on her own when the two girls were shopping together in a local store. Her car broke down and she was abducted and subsequently murdered by a local car mechanic Jake Mitchell (Diego Wallraff). He serves 15 years in prison and then returns to his home town. First, Lisa grandmother is killed - it might be suicide from an overdose of insulin or it could be murder. As she testified against him at his trial, Jake is the obvious suspect. Then other people connected with the trial end up murdered. It's a tense and enjoyable thriller and one of the best of the series of Mary Higgins Clark films.",1360454400,3,1035,4.53475935828877
8072516,3,B000A2IP8C,"The problem with ""The Mary Higgins Clark Collection"" of murder mysteries is that many people, including me, feel that they are being given a rather lite version of a murder mystery. With deep respect for the actors and their skills, we get the feeling that they are not first class actors or at least not behaving as such. The stories are tales that have been told numerous times in better, more exciting, and suspenseful ways. The twists that make the episodes different than others are so minor as to be negligible; we still feel that we saw the events previously. Besides, they are twists that have been used in other films.  However, I think that the most damning criticism is that having seen several of films in the collection and several other films that are like them, we know what will happen next. Less than half way through this film, I turned to my wife and said so and so is going to be killed next and that person is the murderer that everyone is trying to uncover. Thus, the films lack suspense and raise a feeling of unease, bordering on dislike.",1343347200,3,1062,4.53125

8072518,2,B000A2IP8C,"This flick is not bad -- it's just entirely routine. The plot is about as novel and engaging as the average episode of any of the several mediocre cop shows that populate our major-network TV schedules -- the shows you might watch if nothing else is on.  The dialog is totally uninspired, and the actors bring no more to their tasks than the material requires.  As the film progressed, my major interest was in deciding whether Max Martini has had a nose job since.  I say he has.",1319846400,,480,4.431818181818182
8072519,1,B000A2IP8C,"This movie is so slow, totally boring.  Poorly acted and edited.  Don't waste your time.",1231286400,2,88,4.8
8072520,5,B000A2IP8C,"I was more interested in seeing how Max Martini [of The Unit] fared in this type of movie.

Lisa Monroe [Gabrielle Anwar] returns after fifteen years to her home town - she is now on the police force - and is now working alongside her former boyfriend, detective Joe O'Connor [Max Martini].

All the evidence points to Jenny Rands killer who has now been released from prison setting off a rash of murders of all who had testified against him. [Our bad boy sure had a look about him]

Jenny Rand appears to be, at sixteen, a flirt and a tease.  And is willing, at first, to push the limit, thinking she could not get hurt.

I did miss the tease about the green car.

Eventually Lisa starts wondering about the murders - something just did not add up - Joe and the older cop wondered if Lisa could be objective.

The movie told the story exceptionally well - meaning I will watch it again - the characters were perfect in their parts - the sequence of murders were well constructed - I did so like Max as Joe - will be watching for any other movies he makes.

DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED - thoroughly enjoyable without too much gore. Although I do enjoy blood, guts and action.",1182211200,15,1171,4.388888888888889
