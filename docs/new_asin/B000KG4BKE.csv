8156367,1,B000KG4BKE,Substance video.  Imagine my disappointment opening my amazon box only to be confronted by SUBSTANCE video. My heart sank. I knew what I was going to get. Another cruddy bootleg recorded to TV right off of tape. This video company should be banned from all stores. Do not buy. Wait for an Anchor Bay or someone to release this title. Into the garbage with this one. Sad.,1277251200,5,370,4.522388059701493

8156369,2,B000KG4BKE,"I purchased this movie because I was such a big fan of Lucio Fulci's horror movies that I wanted to see his non-horror movies as well. Now because the director is known for his gore and with the title Massacre Time, the movie is billed as this ultra-violent bloodbath, but it is far from it. I was surprised to find such a straight, run of the mill western from Fulci. If you are looking for Fulci's infamous gore, do not buy this movie, this is only for Fulci fanatics who desire to see everything Fulci.",1196726400,3,505,4.326315789473684
