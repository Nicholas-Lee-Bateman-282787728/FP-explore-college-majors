2308543,5,B0009PBLRM,"I saw this movie a long time ago on Cable and had been looking to own it for a long time. No one had it anywhere. So I was quite pleased to find it on Amazon. Being a big Jane Austen fan I found this take on Pride and Prejudice very refreshing. Modern day and Indian culture, played very well together to tell the story. The songs were just okay but the Bollywood style dancing was fun to watch. I really enjoyed it.",1519862400,,416,4.024096385542169

2308552,4,B0009PBLRM,"Two cultures collided together in the evolutionary film, Bride and Prejudice. The film stars and Indian family whom are looking for proper suitors to marry their daughters. Family is no joke in this film, family is one of the most important things for these characters and the society they live in. Bride and Prejudice starts with an American man, Darcy, coming to India with his best friend Belraj to find him a wife. They meet the Bakshi family and from that point forward the film turns into a wild love story. Bride and Prejudice is a delightful film with the perfect balance of Hollywood and Bollywood.
  The first experience I had with the Bollywood genre was very different from my normal Hollywood genre experiences. Normally in Hollywood movies the story line aims for a worldwide audience but in the Bollywood films I have watched the story line aims for a more domestic audience including a lot of Indias own culture, values, and customs. Hollywood films are also normally all about the thrill and adventure to excite the audience, which is very different from Bollywood films which tend to be 99% song and dance. Americans are known for their fast paced lifestyle which is why most films that are produced in Hollywood tend to be under two and a half hours long, contrasting to Bollywood films which tend to be a whole family affair so these films on average are more than three hours long! With all these facts in mind Bride and Prejudice is still the perfect blend between Hollywood and Bollywood. The film was under three hours long and still had multiple scenes of song and dance but the scene did not take over the whole movie. Also, the director made the movie acceptable to both culturals by introducing American and British men into the film.
  Cultural elements are very prominent in Bride and Prejudice. Marriage is of large importance in any culture but in the movie it is emphasized to be extremely important in Indian culture/society. Mrs. Bakshi expresses in the film that marriage is more important than love at first, explain to her you marry first then love comes later! This cultural element is very different from most western views shown through Darcy's character, as a man normal falls in love with a women and then pursues her, I cannot understand arranged marriage, you need love. Another cultural element I learned that stood out in the film was the idea of strong women. In the beginning of the film Lalita stood up to Darcy telling him she is not just a simple women and that he should leave India if he just expects to find simple women. Throughout the film she also challenges him and makes him work hard to get her, which is a pretty typical plot line in Hollywood movies but they also never show intimacy in the film as that is traditional in Bollywood.",1511654400,,2795,4.697959183673469
2308553,3,B0009PBLRM,"In Bride and Prejudice, the Bakshi family is looking to set their daughters up in arranged marriages. When their pick for their daughter, Lalita, doesn't go as planned the family is thrown into a lot of drama. Lalita falls for a man who is not Indian, and struggles to find acceptance within her family. The movie takes us through the relationships of Lalita's sisters as well, showing how they have or haven't broken the bounds of marriage within Indian culture. This film is certainly no typical Academy Award winner that us Westerners are used to, but it was pretty entertaining if you enjoy romantic comedies from the 2000's. Given the brief knowledge I have about Bollywood films, I don't think this movie did that well in showing viewers what Bollywood is.
 I expected a lot more random musical numbers that were there soley for entertainment. Don't get me wrong, a lot were pretty out there, the Cobra Dance was pretty wild, but even with its uniqueness it still followed the line of the plot. After watching clips from other Bollywood films I expected there to at least be a combination of both random songs and songs that followed the plot. This movie, labeling itself a crossover, felt very familiar to me. The main differences that I saw were just that the characters were Indian, and they participated in that culture, which is something Hollywood is unfortunately not good at embracing. If this movie were the same but whitewashed (like most Hollywood films are), I don't think I would find the movie very groundbreaking. Bride and Prejudice reminded me of the traditional romantic comedy set up (that we are very familiar with in America) where boy meets girl, there is a conflict with parents or a friend, conflict is solved, then there is a conflict with the boy and girl, but in the end they get together.  I could easily compare the plot line to something like 50 First Dates which also came out in 2004. In Bollywood films, they combine a lot of different genres together in order to make the movie appealing, but in most comedies or romantic comedies today you will get that as well. Movies like 21 Jumpstreet are labeled as comedies but have aspects of action and romance in them, similarly to how Bride and Prejudice had lots of love triangles, some comedic characters and parts of the plot, and even some action during a fight scene. I will admit though, Hollywood films can get a little raunchy. Viewers don't like to go without seeing at least a kiss in a romantic comedy, but Bride and Prejudice stayed true to Bollywood roots by showing nothing more than a long hug or stare.
 I felt like this movie did a good job of showing that arranged marriages aren't necessarily a terrible thing, and that parents can be more forgiving than Westerners give them credit for. However, they did give in to some stereotypes, and made jokes at the expense of Indians. In a strictly Bollywood film this could be okay since the intended audience is Indian, but a movie aimed at audiences in the west should definitely exclude the use of any harmful stereotypes since then Westerners might think they are acceptable since they were said by an Indian director.
Hollywood does a poor job of embracing diversity and other cultures. In America, there are plenty of people who could relate to the traditions of this story, or at least respect and learn from it. However, in Hollywood we are guilty of directing our focus towards mainly white audiences. The crossover concept is one that I think is important in order to expose Americans to other cultures and lifestyles, but in the case of Bride and Prejudice I'm not sure if it successfully did that fully since I think the storyline was too familiar. The movie itself didn't have that many Bollywood aspects so it was hard to appreciate that part of Indian culture.",1511568000,,3821,4.7256371814092955

2308638,4,B0009PBLRM,"The movie Bride and Prejudice is a love story from two parts of the world. This movie is about two families, one from India and the other from America. The main protagonist, Lalita is in search of love which cant seem to find her. When a rich American visits India with intentions to build a hotel, they seem to draw to each other. The American, Will Darcy, has a hard time adjusting to the difference of culture. Friendships are made and broken and love is eventually found. Love has its way of persevering. I very much enjoyed this movie as it was my first time watching a Bollywood film.
My first experience with Bollywood took me by surprise. I was expecting more of a culture based movie with little interest in the action aspect of our film industry. To my surprise i found the movie to be very well done and had my attention the entire time. It wasn't a full Bollywood film because if the American influence on it but it still stayed on the path of a more traditional Bollywood movie.
I learned very important aspects of the Indian culture and atmosphere in which they live in everyday. The way they dress, dance, and sing were all new to me and really helped me understand their culture in a way that I never thought of before I watched the film. The director used the two cultures to compare and contrast with one another. In India, most marriages are arranged yet in Western civilization we are allowed to make that choice for ourselves. All in all thought it was a very well put together movie and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something new.",1461801600,,1571,4.458333333333333
2308639,4,B0009PBLRM,"Bride and prejudice brings together the worlds of Hollywood and Bollywood in one film. This movie follows the story of a family of sisters struggling to decide whether to marry for love or to have their parents arrange their marriage. Lalita, the second oldest sister, is set up with a traditional indian man from America with a bold personality who is looking for a quiet wife from india to bring back to the states. Lalita struggles to decide whether she should marry this man or if she should marry the man she loves. I enjoyed the movie, there were many plot twists that keep the viewer interested for the duration of the film.
 The Bollywood genre is certainly different from traditional Hollywood movies, however, I very much enjoyed the Bollywood aspects in Bride and Prejudice. I was very entertained by the amount of music, dance, and color in this film. For example, at the very beginning of the story there is a big dance number that everyone in the town is involved in. This scene was very exciting and full of color.
 In this movie I learned the importance that people in the Hindu culture find in the people they marry. I also learned how much they value family relationships in this culture. This was shown in the film by Lalitas mother trying to set her daughters up with successful men, she cared so much about who they married because she wanted her family to be happy and well off.
Her mother would rather she marry a man that would insure her comfort and stability than someone who she truly loves.",1461801600,,1518,4.597785977859779

Film review
 The film Bride and Prejudice is a traditional bollywood movie with an american twist. It will catch your attention right away because it is filled with romance, songs, drama, and handsome actors. This film is about an indian family with daughters who are of age to be married. Jaya, the eldest daughter has found someone to be her partner. Unfortunately, the mother, Mrs. Bakshi is a gold digger who wants all of her daughters to be married to successful men. She calls Mr. Kholi, a successful Indian man who lives in LA, to come meet her daughters, but Lalita wants to find love and not be stuck in an arranged marriage with someone she doesnt love. As the film progresses, Lalita falls for Will Darcy, but it takes her a very long time to actually give him a chance because of the way he acts.
 Based on what we learned in class about Bollywood films, this movie was a perfect perfect crossover of Bollywood and Hollywood films. Although this film was more dramatic than most western style movies, I saw several cultural elements in both areas. This film, in my opinion, seemed to be more like a musical than what you would normally expect in a bollywood film with the musical breaks that come out of nowhere. The musical scenes somehow made sense with the plot of the movie. If you listened to the Lyrics of the song, you could understand how the actress was feeling. This movie really helped me understand some of the cultural elements in India. The most prominent element was arranged marriage. In this movie Lalita believe in true love and living a happy life with someone that cares for her as herself, and not just as the stereotypical picture wife who sits at home and does nothing.
 I learned that the indian culture relies on arranged marriages, and celebrates things differently than how an american culture would. Even Indian people who do not live in India practice the indian culture. For example, Mr Kholi lived in Los Angeles and he went all the way to India to meet his possible bride to take back home to America. I was angry when he said that his wife would basically just be his arm candy who will not have to work. In the US, when people get married, most of the time, both the husband and the wife work to help pay for the things that they own. To present other cultural ideas, the director showed the traditional dances and colors. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I felt like I was in India with them experiencing a new cultural experience.",1461801600,,2502,4.555555555555555
2308641,4,B0009PBLRM,"This film Bride & Prejudice was the perfect crossover film of Bollywood & Holly Wood that we didn't know we needed but we did.. Bride & Prejudice was about two sisters trying to find love, In a culture where it is super important to marry your daughter off. With a meddling mother, Jaya and Lalita are trying to find their perfect husband. Jaya is the oldest daughter of four girls she's of marriageable age so it's important for her parents to find her a husband. While Lalita is the second oldest with different values from her older sister and parents, Lalita would rather find love for herself rather than have her mother involved in her love life. This Film is a story of family, Love, Finding yourself and accepting others. The film also has the romance fun and drama that's always good in a movie Bollywood or Holly Wood. Overall the film was very enjoyable for a first time Bollywood Viewer such as myself.
Bride & Prejudice was the first full length Bollywood film id have every seen. Knowing a little about Bollywood I wasn't sure what i was going to get. But over all it was easy to follow the film directors different overly throw culture references at you that most western viewers wouldn't understand. It was a good balance, Like all Bollywood films there random experts of dance.(like what you would find in western musicals) Not being used to this type of film it can be jarring when they all of a sudden start to sing and dance, but once you begin to watch this movie you slowly get use to it. Before watching any Bollywood film research would be the best way to go, you don't have to go into a full blown researcher but to find out about the genre. But overall it's a good starting point if you want to watch Bollywood films but aren't ready for the full force of Bollywood.
Like all Bollywood films culture is a big part,This film gives you enough Indian/Hindu culture to keep you interested and be able to understand what's happening all around you. But of course going into the film with no background knowledge will make it a little hard to understand but of course enjoyable all the same you should do some research into what Bollywood really is. The Culture in the movie is lovely and placed very well you are following a slightly more traditional Indian family, seeing how they interact with each other and how daughter are treated in the culture. We see a nice blend of the Indian culture and some american culture not too much to try to make the movie too american but enough to understand. The only problem i say with the with the film is the song No Life Without Wife they tried to go for a more american musical approach it turns out cheesy to say the least (thing of like Disney style musicals watching that seen made me think of the sleepover song in Disney's Teen Beach) overall that song didn't fit well with the movie. Other then that the movie is a truly wonderful movie to watch if you're a first time Bollywood viewer.",1461801600,,2956,4.496282527881041
2308642,4,B0009PBLRM,"Right off the bat Bride and Prejudice will catch your attention with the vibrant colors of an Amistar party. Lalita, the middle daughter of the Bakshi family, is a stubborn girl who will not settle for an arranged marriage. Her eldest sister is getting married at the beginning of the movie, adding more pressure to the other sisters to find a suitable indian mate. At Lalitas sister's engagement party, Lalita and Jaya spot two men staring at them while they show off their traditional Indian dancing. Jaya falls for Mr. Balraj, while headstrong Lalita conversates with haughty William Darcy, an American hotel heir. The rest of the film is filled with jet setting adventures, romance, song, and dance centered around the Bakshi sisters. Lalita opens her heart up to Darcy, only to be hurt by him. By the end of the movie, the typical Indian traditions are not as prominent as an unexpected love blooms. Bride and Prejudice kept me very entertained throughout the film with a mix of Bollywood tunes and traditions, with an American twist!
 From the first the scene of Bride and Prejudice, I knew Bollywood was very different from Hollywood films. For example, it is way more dramatic than a typical western film. The acting is very in your face, nothing is left to guess. They do not show physical affection, instead they just hug a lot to show their feelings for one another.  All their emotions are either said, or shown dramatically on their faces. The romance scenes are very mushy, and they tend to fall in love fast. Jaya and Balraj talked and danced and before you know it they were considering marriage. Also, Lalita and Darcy were very quick to fall in love, which their beach scenes symbolized. I also noticed how important it is to go with Indian culture. Arranged marriage is discussed heavily in the movie, almost acting as the plot that leads Lalita away from it. My reaction to the random song and dance scenes is a very positive one. Even though it would be sort of unrelated to a current scene, they were so colorful and entertaining. The various locations the characters would travel to all in one song was funny, but cool. Being a big fan of musicals, it was enjoyable to watch. Bollywood movies seem to have like every genre in them. There were scenes that were very intense, funny, or sad. Overall Bollywood was new to me. I have never seen a movie shot in India, let alone a Bollywood one.
All the cultural elements were very shocking to me, but interesting to see during the film. The most important thing I learned was about marriage. Once your child is up to marriage age, parents are basically hunting for a spouse for them. As Mrs. Bakshi said, the order is marriage first, then love. They look for someone that would be financially stable with a good background. I found it crazy that the parents look for the mate, but in a way it kind of makes sense. Parents can tell the differences between a good and bad family. They have engagement parties so the couple can finally meet and dance before their wedding, like what happened to the eldest sister. I think the director did very well considering I learned so much about the culture and Bollywood. To someone who is for familiar with the culture, I don't know know if it would be the case because I don't know how accurate it all is. They seem to limit some of womans actions because they can not travel alone and the males get more of a say in a possible marriage. I learned this when Balraj asked Jaya to travel with him and Lalita had to go with them. Mr Kholi, the self-made man looking for a wife, was allowed to formally ask Lalita to be his wife, and at first it looked like she might not be able to turn it down. That scene made it seem as if it was more up the male. The cultural elements throughout the movie taught me a lot in the end.",1461801600,,3825,4.518037518037518
2308643,4,B0009PBLRM,"Bride and Prejudice captures your attention instantly with this huge scene of women in colored saris, this idea of marriage, and how sacred it is to Indian culture. The sehra, henna, saree are all cultural elements you see in the film which are vastly different from the Western culture. This Bollywood crossover is a story about two sisters Jaya and Lalita, who struggle to find marriage; whether it being not the right man or just being stubborn. Jaya comes across a nice man named Balraj who she falls for leaving Lalita loveless but still determined to find her own love without the help of her meddling mother. Balraj brings along a friend named Will Darcy to India. Having eyes for Lalita, with her headstrong personality, she sees Darcy only as a tourist trying to buy out her homeland to make it a theme park. These two quarrel throughout the film only to find love in the end. Personally, I enjoyed this film. I thought it was a perfect crossover between Bollywood and Hollywood.
 My first reaction to the Bollywood genre was how dramatic everything was. The song and dance scenes were very over done but got the point across. For instance, when Mr. Kholi arrived to the Bakshis house and makes the statement, no life without wife, we see the sisters break out in a song and dance of how annoyed they are with that statement he made and how they feel about him negatively. Another time we see an over dramatized scene was when the younger sister Maya does a snake dance and frightens their dinner guests.
 I learned so much from this film. In the beginning of the movie, I learned that men will dress like women to stage as a beggar or in order to bestow blessings on a marriage. I noticed that women do NOT travel alone; they always have one other person with them. There is no kissing or anything like that before marriage and when it is time to kiss the bride at the wedding, the groom kisses the bride on the hand not the lips. The director did a great job at exposing a little bit of each culture. It is shown greatly how in L.A. money and a good job is a huge deal, along with status. Whereas in India, family is all you need to live a good life.

2308644,4,B0009PBLRM,"Marrying the cultures and filming elements of Hollywood and Bollywood films results in the product of Bride and Prejudice. In this movie, Will Darcy and Mr. Balraj, from the United States and Britain, respectfully, attend a wedding in a part of India.  Mr. and Mrs. Bakshi are looking to have their daughters married, especially their eldest daughters Lalita and Jaya.  Throughout the duration of the film, Darcy deals with his prejudice firsthand while he begins to feel sentimental toward Lalita.  Balraj is close to marrying Jaya but mysteriously cuts ties with her during the middle of the film.  Personally, I found this movie to be a little slow, but I did enjoy it a little bit.

As a first time viewer of a Bollywood production, I found this experience to be enriching.  I was happy that Bride and Prejudice was my first film of the Bollywood genre that I have seen because it does not fully take on what a true Bollywood film includes, but it also contains some Hollywood elements (the types of movies I am used to seeing).  For example, there was a traditional Indian wedding in the movie, but the wedding was held in Los Angeles.  As someone who is used to an action-packed Hollywood film, I did, however, find some parts of the film a little slow and drawn out.  In general, Bollywood films can be upwards of 3 hours in duration, but Bride and Prejudice is roughly 2 hours long.

Some typical elements of a Bollywood film that were included in Bride and Prejudice include the numerous dancing scenes.  In almost all Bollywood productions, there is a minimum of 3 to 5 lengthy dancing scenes.  I think that these scenes make for a good break in the movie, and they are entertaining to watch.  The dancing style of the Hindu culture is very elegant and beautiful.  The producer did a good job of including the dancing element of Bollywood films in the movie.  Also, I think the film did a good job of showing the importance of family and marriage in the Indian culture.  Darcy explicitly states how he notices that the Bakshi family is close-knit and the topic of marriage is brought up a lot by all of the Bakshi sisters.  Mrs. Bakshi, at one part of the film, stresses how marriage comes before developing feelings of love.  This is something that is unique about the Indian culture so it was important for the producer of Bride and Prejudice to include it in the duration of the movie.",1461715200,,2398,4.615566037735849
2308645,3,B0009PBLRM,"Hollywood in Bollywood. This movie was able to capture the american tone within india. With speaking english and the native language to filming in India, Britain, and California. The two eldest daughters found love, but it did run into some troubles. Jaya did find love and ended up happy.  Lalita did as well. I liked how this movie incorporated Hollywood within Bollywood. Being a foreign movie it was interesting to watch because it did add in things I see in daily shows in America. The movie wasn't too long but I would like it to continue and add life after marriage or make a sequel to this movie.
  This is my first ""Bollywood"" film I believe that this was almost a true Bollywood film when the girls were dancing in the street singing about marriage and the men dressed as women do exist in Bollywood. The dances were original in the film to the real Indian dances.
I learned that the oldest daughters have to marry first and fast because it gives the family a bad name. Arrange marriage is very important in this culture. You marry first and then love grows. The director incorporated American and Indian cultures together very well in a good mix that was balanced and enjoyable. I enjoyed the scenes where it showed the Indian locations but also California with England in the mix of the both of them.",1461715200,,1312,4.598290598290598

Yes, there are many parallels that can be drawn, but it is, at best - a very watered down version of the classic. It is more like a drop of Pride and Prejudice in a tub of water- thats the amount of dilution.

Moreover, in this one, there is this whole Indian/Foreigner angle, which essentially turns it into something else altogether. Not a bad plot line at all, but not Pride and Prejudice.

Andas handsome as he is, Martin Henderson is no Darcy ( to be fair, I need to mention here, that in my mind - there is just ONE Mr. Darcy, and he is Colin Firth, so no one else would work anyway).

As far as the rest of the cast, I believe they got the basic character sketches right, much better than the movie starring Matthew MacFadyen & Keira Knightley. Also, peppy Bollywood numbers are a definite improvement over stuffy balls (though there are far too many of them).

Overall - It is a decent one-time watch, but not a true adaptation.

2308820,5,B0009PBLRM,"I love this adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice."" The translation of her story to the modern world in the context of India and emigration works extremely well. The filmmakers did a marvelous job of tightening up the story line to essentials, while keeping the major plot points. They did move one major plot point (Lalita/Lizzie's rejection of Darcy) to late in the story, but it worked well.

One caveat: you need to like musicals to like this production. For myself, it just adds to the movie. For others, it may be an irritation. I like Gurinder Chadha's work in general, and this one is genius. There is some griping in the comments about particular songs, or the use of Bollywood sensibilities, but it really comes together in a harmonious whole if you can open yourself to the concept. Sometimes I put on ""No Life without Wife"" just for a good giggle. And the climactic fight scene staged against a Bollywood classic movie is absolutely perfect.

This movie suffers from having had some promotions ""specialist"" somewhere compare it to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" That was an unfortunate comparison, as the movies are completely different in intent, story arc, character journeys, etc. They both have ""ethnic"" weddings, but that is NOT a good reason to compare them! If you liked ""MBF Greek Wedding,"" then go find another RomCom to watch. If you want a high-energy musical kick in the funny bone that slips in intelligent dialogue and discussion of real-world issues about blending families and culture then watch ""Bride and Prejudice.""",1450224000,,1554,4.927480916030534
2308821,5,B0009PBLRM,Interesting twist on an old classic.  Very well done.  One of my favorites.,1449705600,,75,4.6923076923076925
2308822,4,B0009PBLRM,"Charming Lolita in her less gallant life style goes through many trials when she has to choose a husband. She is a fiery character who stands for her beliefs. Her suitors consist of a Rich boy from America, a distant cousin (?????) from Amrika, and a wondering hippie who may or may not have been a hippie. Lolita does not want to marry any of them!! Clinging onto her chores and father Lolita pushes away two suitors, and has a lingering friendship with the hippie. A short monologue after i dipped my toe into Bollywood and the culture of India.
During her tale, Lolita often stops for song, just like a comedian would stop for a drink. I don't know if shes sharing her hallucinations with us or if they lived in a different reality that breaks out in perfectly coordinated song and dance every six minutes. Why does this happen? Bollywood meets hollywood. This is my first time around too, don't worry. Bollywood must be in the next universe from ""Bride and Prejudice,"" as Bollywood exceeded social standards in American movies. Outrageously cheesy, the acting held my attention longer than any other movie. Immediately, I was sucked into the alternative reality of cheesy lines and coordinated dancing. I loved their exaggerated facial expressions and mixed energy cast. Bollywood meets Hollywood, with due to the more tangible characters and plot line. I think this movie is perfect for the introduction into the genre. It grazed main themes in Bollywood such as love triangles, family, society, and hard to get women.
Rich American Boy, Darcy, Distant relative (???) and the hippie guy's culture all contrast with that of India. All though Lolita finds Darcy cross, they actually share personal culture. In one scene, Darcy's friend connects Darcy and Lolita over books. Ethic topics are also breached. Some cultural differences such as arranged marriages, living at home until you're married, large families, and busy streets popped out to me. Darcy went to look at hotels to buy. Lolita, always a witty character, drills Darcy about the hotel's culture vs the ""true culture of India.""
Overall I give the film a 4 out of five, as some instances are  a bit cheesier than I am used to. Overall compelling cast and enchanting plot leave me as a fan.",1449446400,,2253,4.851948051948052

The casting is spot-on :Indian actress Aishwarya Rai  plays Lalita/Elizabeth true to character, smart, witty, independant. Jaya/Jane is beautiful, vulnerable, reserved, Chadha brings a new take with a Darcy whose arrogance is cultural, but whose vulnerability makes him as attractive as Darcy/Firth's arrogance. Balraj/Bingley is more sophisticated, but has the warm good nature of. Austen's Bingley, and the attraction between Jaya and Balraj sparkles immediately. Lalita and Darcy's relationship is all any Austenphile could wish - push and pull, the tension builds, crackles with energy.  The two love stores are surrounded by the clash of cultures and characters, lush campy Bollywood dance numbers and an ending that'll satisfy everyone who thought Wickham gets off easily.",1447200000,,901,5.7164179104477615

2308956,3,B0009PBLRM,"As a non-Indian American, I adore the simple fun that Bollywood movies have. The bright colors, the love story, and the random songs and dances are all trademarks of the genre. Most Bollywood movies are not in English, so I was ecstatic to see an English version with the amazing Aishwarya Rai. Sadly, the movie is a caricature of Bollywood elements, that tries too hard to be what ti's not. Over the top acting, musical numbers, and very little chemistry between the two leads made this film hard to watch. I expected more from the director of ""Bend It Like Beckham"", but still give three stars for Aishwarya Rai's first major English film performance.",1444435200,,653,4.7368421052631575

2309161,4,B0009PBLRM,"I think the parallels to the Jane Austen novels are well thought. Its a very unique and creative vision to make a movie built on the premise of a Western classic, with elements of Bollywood, and attempt to address the ignorance that can be present when two cultures meet, and package it into a fun and light-hearted movie. I will say, that though the musical numbers were great, I found them a little lacking. This may be because my immediate intuition was to compare them to Bollywood standards - which would not be fair to the film. This is a great movie to watch at night, in bed, with some popcorn. Maybe, with a patient S.O. Pretty good job, would watch many more movies if available from the director.",1438214400,,707,4.488372093023256

2309228,5,B0009PBLRM,"This movie was self-deprecating, colorful, vibrant, and so much fun to watch. Making Darcy an American was the perfect touch. I haven't had any experience with Bollywood movies, so like the other commenters, I didn't realize what I was in for. I actually almost skipped over the movie because of its Indian influences (thought the accents would be hard to understand), but I'm so glad I gave it a chance! It's a delightful mashup of genres, so traditionalists may not appreciate it.

The costumes were so colorful and beautiful, the acting was fabulous, and the songs/dancing were just as cheesy as a musical should be. I'm a newer Jane Austen fan, and loved that this movie generally stayed true to plot, while maintaining its own flavor. The changes made to the plot made sense for the movie. India really made sense to the changes made. Lolita also made several remarks to Darcy about Westerners not wanting to experience 'real' Indian culture; the movie itself exposed the viewer to Indian dances and culture, which was pretty cool.

Aishwarya Rai, Lalita (=Lizzy) was just absolutely beautiful. I mean, there were several times where I just could not get over how beautiful she is. She also nailed the role and put Darcy in his place with intelligence, rather than cold-heartedness.",1436140800,,1287,4.926267281105991
2309229,5,B0009PBLRM,I really love the show Pride and Prejudice and own the master piece collection.  I thought this was a fun adaptation as far as a Bollywood musical goes.  When Mr. Wickham appears from the ocean I thought it was really funny.  In fact I found myself smiling through much of the movie and thought it would be a good show to watch to improve a bad day.  It's not for everyone but with me this Bollywood Bride & Prejudice has found a home.,1436140800,,435,4.204819277108434

If you're in the mood for a song and dance movie reminiscent of Hollywood's black and white song and dance movies of the 30's and 40's but set in India, then this movie may entertain you too.

We watched less than half of the movie last night before we had to give up on it and watch something else. While it's not a bad movie, it was just so conceptually dated that we got bored with it and gave up on it as a lost cause. The people are pretty, cute, handsome or funny, as required, and there is some vigorous but rather alien dancing but for us it just didn't work.

Looking at the other reviews, it seems that it appeals to some so my suggestion is to watch it before you buy it.",1396310400,,805,4.056603773584905

I rated it 5/5 because it is hilarious, great songs, and a wonderful adaption to Pride and Prejudice. Comparing this to Austenland, I like it better, because Austenland was ridiculously following Jane Austen (more or less) without any major changes, whereas this adaptation changes the story-line slightly but it is so much more funny, colorful, and WAY MORE CHILD APPROPRIATE THAN AUSTENLAND!

Reason for low rating. It has been said that this movie is just a copy a bootleg this is untrue. The DVD does have it's problems which make it look like a copy.
1st: it has No menu 2nd: It has No chapters and 3rd: It has No subtitles not even in the places were it should have them. There is a part at the beginning of the movie where everyone is singing and dancing. The singing is subtitled when you watch this movie on TV but is not on the DVD. I don't know if it was intentional or not but you expect them there and they don't show up. Their is not even an option for them.",1392940800,,651,3.8296296296296295

2309401,5,B0009PBLRM,Our family likes this ethnic Indian Bollywood version of the british Pride & Prejudice.  It has a unique charm in not being American in nature.  Aishwarya Rai is a beauty and actor Martin Henderson is the good-looking American counterpart to the British William Darcy.  The colorful dance scenes are unique and very unAmerican in its style.,1391212800,,340,5.035714285714286

All the actors were excellent and the music was great. The movie was filmed in English and some parts of the movie were filmed in America and England, but most of the movie was filmed in India.

My 15 year old daughter really likes this movie, too. In fact, it came in the mail early in the week but my daughter didn't want me to watch it until we could watch it together (which wouldn't have been until the weekend). I waited to watch it with her but it wasn't easy .  I don't usually write reviews about anything, but the story line, the costumes, the music, the colors are worth it.

Well i have to say it was delivered on time. I was slightly worried while waiting for it cause i kept imagining that the disk would be scratched and all but my worries were all for not lol. I was pretty new, at least it looked so to me.

When i first saw the disk i thought it was bootleg you know, it didn't look as fancy as disks normally looked but the resolution was clear and showed no sign that it had been copied or that it was bootlegged. A particular little piece that i recall seeing the first time i ever saw this movie was missing which once again made me question whether this movie had been copied or if it was the original. Well that missing little piece, just a particular three word sentence in one of the song was what was missing but other than that, all was present. it was enjoyable now as it was several years ago when i saw it.

the DVD box looked new too. All in all, i give this a 5 star for excellent service, the speedy transaction and for it being new and not bootlegged lol",1367452800,,1157,4.043668122270742

2309455,4,B0009PBLRM,"When I hear Bollywood, I think it's the style of all of India.  And even though it's highly popular in India too, it's still just a portion amount of India's film industry.  Just like Hollywood is just a portion of America's film making.  Bollywood also isn't just song and dance, much to my surprise. Until now I thought Bollywood was just that.  But that would be like saying all Broadway plays are song and dance.  Upon looking up the term in Wikipedia, Bollywood has a term for the song and dance films too.  Filmi music is attributed to the style of the music, play, actor and attitude.

Bride and Prejudice was my first Bollywood experience.  I am already prejudice towards liking this because I did a lot of theatre work in Jr. High up to some community college shows.  I always worked backstage and I feel that's the best place to watch from.  It's magical that way.  So I was intrigued with the movie's songs and dance scenes.  They had a lot of extras dancing and ""singing"" (Bollywood the majority of the actors lip sync).

I loved the acting in this film.  Martin Henderson is quite good looking and he does a good job acting.  You could tell that he was out of his elements with the dancing and songs.  But it was really charming and cute.  The storyline is India society per pressure meets Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.  It was both cute and well written.  Much better than ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clueless/dp/B00001MXXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clueless</a>"" that's for sure.

2309457,5,B0009PBLRM,I have always been a fan of the color and music of Bollywood movies.  This was a classic story where the characters fell in love without first having sex.  It was like the old time movies where before it was physical it was emotional.,1365465600,,234,4.295454545454546
2309458,3,B0009PBLRM,This movie was somewhat disjointed.  If you are not familiar with Pride & Predjuce you may get lost. The plot was confusing because the characters were not developed enough to draw you in.,1365033600,,188,4.696969696969697

The DVD is not at all what it claims & comes as a burned DVD looking more like a pirated copy you could buy on a street corner. All the subtitles are missing for the songs & the main menu itself looks like someone cut & pasted from their home computer onto the DVD--no special features(even thought they were listed on DVD jacket) & your only option is to press play. At times, it even skips entire segments of the movie & you're forced to rewind several times to get it to play correctly all the way through. I ordered this DVD twice & the results were the same both times. Save yourself the trouble & buy a copy directly from the company if you can.

I liked that it is based on Austen's P&P and I find that I cannot resist Austenesque pastiche. I was intrigued with an Indian setting, being curious to see how Bollywood would interpret her work. The actors were good and I liked the blend of manners. I would have liked it better without the awkward musical injections that afflicted the film sporatically. The dancing that was germane to the plot was well executed and enjoyable. (The ""Indian MC Hammer"" line was witty as well!) The ""musical"" lyrics were lame and none of it added to the quality of the film nor advanced the plot. Which was pretty superficial. There wasn't time to dig into any tension between the characters who were supposed to shadow Austen's characters.

Lost fans will enjoy Naveen Andrews being a good sport, leading a big dance number.  He clearly is not a natural dancer(little out of step and watching his feet) but throws himself right into it making it fun to watch.
The actors appear to be enjoying themselves, and therefore give good performances. Aishwarya Rai and Martin Henderson are believable as  the reluctant lovers.  Anupam Kher is a delight to watch as the beleaguered father. Nadira Babbar almost steals the show as the mother desperate to see her daughters marry.

Although it's fun, especially the idea, it doesn't quite deliver. My complaints: Aishwarya is a bit too angry and proud in this one for the viewer to really root for her. Too many rolled eyes, huffs, judgments, and barked out conversations. Also, they never really resolve the issues she has with William Darcy, they just sort of gloss over them. One minute she's yelling at him and the next she's not. I also didn't like the Broadway style music and dance numbers -- they were too American (and I'm an American).

Bride and Prejudice however, is all in ENGLISH.

Directed by an Indian woman and with a truly glorious cast of Indian stars, B&P makes a splash in the still, monochromatic, wooden waters of Hollywood. Watching B&P brings to mind Disney's elaborate musical numbers, where the entire world participates in the song, only it's with real people. It's like the 60's again, only with fewer dance solos.

In short, it has all the charm of Disney Princesses and the 60's, with colors so bright you'll want to touch them, and it's in English.

2309510,4,B0009PBLRM,"""Bride and Prejudice"" Is an almost terrific musical comedy (if you can call it that), loosely based on Jane Austen's novel of a similar name.  It is a story of culture and personal clashes that nearly derail true love.  Aishwarya Rai plays Lalita, a headstrong, literate young Indian woman who is repulsed by William. Darcy (Martin Henderson), a boorish American who travels to India and sneers at its people and customs.  Of course, both of their attitudes change and happiness prevails in the end.

The movie is a wild combination of comedy and outrageous musical numbers the like of which haven't been seen (in Hollywood, that is) since the glory days of Busby Berkeley.  People and entire towns burst into song and dance at the drop of a hat.

Unfortunately the movie sags once the family leaves India, the plot turns serious, and the musical numbers become more subdued.

Rai is radiant, and gives a wonderful performance.  Most of the rest of the cast are fine as well. Nadira Babbar is especially funny as Lalita's social-climbing, matchmaking mother.  The only exception is Henderson, who totally lacks charisma.  One can easily agree with Lalita's initial contempt, but not when she inevitably falls in love with him.  The romantic interludes are forced and unbelievable.  Someone with more personality, like Daniel Gillies, who plays Darcy's bad boy brother, would have been a far better choice than Henderson

But it's a hoot despite its flaws.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride!",1312329600,,1490,4.955645161290323
2309511,4,B0009PBLRM,"The movie follows P&P pretty closely but obviously changes things to modernize it. The ""Bennet"" family dynamics are much the same. A friend is getting married and at her engagement party, the family meets the friends of the groom- the Bingleys (Indians from the UK) and their American friend Darcy. There is no Kitty, Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, or Colonel Fitzwilliam character. The scene of ""Lady Catherine"" trying to tell Lizzy not to get engaged to Darcy did not make the final cut but was included on the DVD as a deleted scene. The DVD itself is great. Along with the deleted scenes, there is a ""Making of"", commentary, and full musical numbers. And possibly something else that I don't remember...

The movie is all fun. It's got great funny musical sequences, bright colors, and good-looking actors and actresses. Some of the acting is really good. Only one characterization really bothered me- Lalita, this version's Lizzy.

She was biggest problem with the movie! Her character was just plain NASTY to Darcy. I don't know what he saw in her, besides her good looks. He was a little uncomfortable in the beginning but was trying his best and she just snapped at everything he said. I read on IMDB that Rai did not read the book so as not to be influenced by Elizabeth. Bad move, for sure. And the writing and directing was off for her too. Elizabeth Bennet is not a witch! Why did they make Lalita one?

2309515,5,B0009PBLRM,"This movie is not really a true adaptation of the original ""Pride and Prejudice"" by Austen. The protagonists don't possess any of the qualities and personality traits exemplified in Austen's novel or seen in many good movie adaptations of the same. Martin Henderson, (Darcy's character), while handsome, felt more like a fixture in the room, detached from everything happening to him, reciting the worst, most insipid lines ever - which in turn did not make him very interesting and enticing like the original Darcy. He does the best he can with what he is given though. I read somewhere that Henderson was primarily chosen for his looks.

Aishwarya Rai's character, Lalita, was not very likable. While very beautiful of course, she seemed snide, arrogant, and rude, which in turn painted her in an unsympathetic light. The character she is based on in the original ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a charming, quick witted and intelligent young lady instead of conceited and snide. She also behaved as if everyone owed her and was totally beneath her and she was merely tolerating them. This makes it hard for Dacry and Lalita to establish any kind of worthwhile chemistry or believable affection. All this is compounded, of course, by the fact that there wasn't much dialog and interaction between the two. No passionate exchanges, no intelligent conversation, none of that. Most of their exchanges consist of passing longing looks at each other across the room or she being offended about everything he says - even before he opens his mouth. When he then does the whole obligatory falling in love with her, it is just not very believable and convincing. The same is true for all characters really: they all just fall in love with each other or do things that are somewhat unsupported by their actions and even words. It gnaws on the believability of a movie and its characters and then ultimately determines its quality when people spontaneously exhibit feelings without any prelude.

I also find Rai's ""virgin Mary"" routine annoying and tiresome. The fact that they never even exchange a kiss made this movie lack something - like the spice that is otherwise sprinkled all over. It could certainly have been done in a tasteful way so it is not offensive to Ms. Rai. I can understand that she doesnt want to film any steamy love scenes or even rumbling around in bed, but they could have kissed at least once and actually I have seen that happen in many Bollywood productions - even with her in it - so it is not like it is unheard of. The ""Pride and Prejudice"" movie with Keira Knightley has, in my opinion, one of the best on-screen kisses (in the end) ever: very tasteful and romantic. Too bad it is missing in this movie.

Finally, it is strange to look at how most of the female characters were cast. Lalita is gorgeous and stands out among her sisters who all seem kind of bland and not very attractive - at least not compared to Lalita. In fact, they are caricatures and stereotypes of sorts and Lalita clearly stands out as the most sophisticated, intelligent, beautiful ing&eacute;nue among them. That makes for predictability because of course Darcy falls in love with her. What else would he do? She is the most gorgeous woman in that village, if not nation. Aishwarya Rai was/is clearly the mega star and it appears as if all the other female leads were cast deliberately so as to not compete with and thus undermine Rai's presence. This movie is almost like a homage to her more than anything else.

All that said, however, I must admit that I personally don't hold this movie to Austen's standards. It stands on its own merits and the ""Pride and Prejudice"" storyline seems to have been used in a very rudimentary way to make room for what the director really wanted to accomplish. This movie is a perfect mix between Bollywood and Hollywood. It is joyful, colorful and happy with a great ensemble and great photography. Despite some missing dialog and depth, Henderson and Rai have still chemistry which would have been sizzling if they actually did talk to each other more and she wasn't so reserved.

I like Gurinder Chadha's style of mixing the cheerful and colorful and traditional with the modern - with added social commentary and comedy, but without it looking like she was pushing for some political message and drama. Life's too short to try to be too serious and the story in a well made movie like this is secondary. As Roger Ebert once said, ""a good movie is not what it's about, it's HOW it is about it."" This movie hit the nail on the head in terms of the how.",1296864000,,4583,4.702366127023661

2309524,5,B0009PBLRM,"Some of the key issues from Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice -- in my opinion the best novel in the English language -- are preserved in this version, but it makes other contributions she might love if she'd lived 200 years to see the Bollywood song-and-dance homage to her story of an intelligent woman trapped by the social mores of her time. I've seen almost every version of the Austen novel that has ever been filmed and have read the book many times. Very few of the films capture the intelligence, the fun, or the passion of the original. This one does. Most of the films dumb down Austen's class commentary and complex relationships, both of which are well done here. Watch for the quick but pointed discussion of American imperialism if you like politics. Although all the music is thrilling, my favorite is ""No Life Without Wife,"" a subtly feminist rejection of men who think they are owed pretty wives -- yet it preserves the Austen irony that even women make ridiculous mistakes in matters of the heart. The young people are gorgeous; the older people are great actors. It will make you laugh.",1275436800,,1113,4.683673469387755

2309529,3,B0009PBLRM,"I was quite disappointed in this movie. I liked only the first part of it, which is the part that has Naveen Andrews in it. He was, hands-down, the best part of this movie. My favorite part was at the beginning when they were at the wedding. The dancing was superb, especially Naveen's, which was quite unexpected. As soon as Naveen disappeared, the movie went downhill in my opinion.

There was only one other dance number I enjoyed, which was the one where the other girls were teasing Aishwarya (Ash) about Mr. Kohli. That number was funny, and the rest of the movie was very boring. I didn't like the rest of the song and dance numbers. The acting was just so-so.

If you want to see a really good Bollywood movie, I highly recommend Kuch Naa Kaho, which was the first Bollywood movie I'd ever seen. Kuch Naa Kaho is the standard I use to measure other Bollywood movies, and so far, none has matched that standard.",1262563200,,918,4.458333333333333

The music is infective and the idea behind the movie is good.  However, the acting is not so great.  Aishwarya Rai in particular she has never really struck me as good in roles where she has to be negative. Her anger at Darcy seems more childish than justified.  Perhaps its because she is contrasted with the American/British group that it comes off that way in this movie.  I like her in most Bollywood movies and she is stunning but still, something just doesn't flow.

However, this movie is upbeat, more modern, and has some beautiful scenes in India filled with color.

But a musical with a real heart and soul...a happy joyful movie that will sweep away all your concerns about the Real World, and hopefully will take you away, as it did me, to the magical escape land most movies today do not do! The lovely and talented actresses that play the 4 sisters were so dear and charming and believeable and the scene where they are all singing in their white pajamas about a suitor their mom was touting...well you just have to see it! Very cute and catchy. The actors and actresses were SO good, so sincere that it made me care very much about the outcome. The times they would break into song worked so well! I hope to see more from the Indian director as she created an outstanding movie ( I am sorry I don't have all the names in front of me)
All of the actors and actresses were so talented and believable, from the parents, to the 4 sisters, to the comical suitor, to the gorgeous Darcy, to Naveen Andrews, but I do have to especially note Aishwarya Rai...Not only does she possess the kind of other worldly beauty that is beyond human, but the woman is a fantastic actress, singer, and dancer! Not for nothing was she a Miss World!
Make sure to watch all the extras! Aishwarya is interviewed, she is brilliant and articulate, and it is fun to see how they made the movie and other cute escapades on the sets, there is also a very charming interview with the handsome actor who played Mr Darcy.

Within minutes, I was in love. The random song and dance numbers, Kholi, the irony, everything was perfect. It was a wonderful twist on Austen's beloved book.

I fell in love with Darcy and Lalita. ""Take me to Love"" has become one of my favorite songs. The Cobra Dance has me falling off my chair from laughter everytime.

Reigning Bollywood Queen Aishwayra Rai portrays Lalita Bakshi, the headstrong independent sister in search of Mr. Right while maintaining her independence. Her foil is American hotel magnate William Darcy played by Martin Henderson.

Just as you get into the storyline, suddenly the cast breaks out into song, reminiscent of ""Grease."" It takes awhile to get into it, and might have some viewers reaching for the fast forward button. I was not impressed with the acting at all; Both Rai and Darcy stand in Martin Donovan were bland and wooden (though the always great Naveen Andrews was excellent and can even dance!)

My husband's aunt asked me if I had seen Bride & Prejudice, which is an East Indian version of the classic. I eventually borrowed it from our dvd club and didn't think that I would find it very amusing - how could anyone interfere with a Jane Austen classic?! Much to my surprize, I found it mostly enjoyable - it is a good comedy and well done. So, I eventually bought it to add to my collection.
There are some things that I found inappropriate for the movie, such as the song ""No life without wife"" - it was too westernized, and Mr. Colly's remarks about lesbians, and the scenes of him in his underwear. Also, I did not appreciate Ashanti's very sensual performance - if it were more toned down and the performers better dressed, it would have been more tasteful (although I don't understand how this scene comes into a take on Pride & Prejudice - it is so out of place in this movie).

Were it not for these few negative scenes, I would add this to our family dvd collection so the whole family could enjoy it, as it is hilarious. I'm really surprized at those negative things I mentioned, as I thought the East Indian culture was more conservative and did not allow such things to be included in their films.

2309558,2,B0009PBLRM,"A complete disappointment.
Terrible script, bad dialogue.
I felt sorry for poor Martin Henderson (Darcy's character) for he was given such horrible lines to deliver. Martin Henderson was thought to be good-looking (in the feature commentary, the director tells us that his looks were deciding factors for casting this actor), but he is terribly bland. He is a far cry from Colin Firth (who is, in my humble opinion, the gold standard Mr. Darcy).
Lalita - terribly acted, a complete misrepresentation of the character of Elizabeth Bennett. Elizabeth is lovely, lively, intelligent, quick witted, but not cross or rude. Lalita seems to have formed prejudice against Darcy even before he said or did anything remotely offensive.
In fact, he is a ""nice guy"" from the very beginning.
And I am not convinced that such a guy - handsome, rich, intelligent - would have anything to do with such cross, unlikeable persona of Lalita.
The actress's facial expression throughout the movie was condescending, arrogant, conceitfull - the complete opposite of what lovely Elizabeth is supposed to be.
Why did I give this grotesque version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" any stars at all?
Music is quite satisfactory, especially the ""Take me to love"" song

What was disappointing in this movie was really characterization. Lallita's character is supposed to be Elizabeth and Elizabeth in Austen's book is supposed to have high standards and good manners. The humor was found in the witty comments and quick tongue in the book. Not only was this movie lacking all forms of humor but they completely missed the actual character of Elizabeth.

Lallita seemed like the more prideful of her country and family while Darcy never did anything to actually influence her assumption of his pride. Lallita was also more than rude and crass. She openly accused him of being prideful when she was really the culprit. Not only was her character terribly formed, but badly acted.

I love musicals. Moulin Rouge was one of my favorites, and I love watching old musicals as well. I also love Ballyfilms. I loved that Bend it like Beckham.

They kept most of the original characters and their names or a slight deviation of their names.
The music was fun and lively, and adapted to the India culture, and the changes were not offensive, although some may object to some innuendos depending on your audience's age. Like the silly scene of ""no wife, no life"" for Mr. Colins.

2309567,4,B0009PBLRM,"Bride and Prejudice (2004)
Directed: Gubiader Chadha
With: Aishwarya Rai:  Lalita Bakshi
  Martin Henderson:  William Darcy

If you think Jane Austen has taken off again--after the outburst of the 90s (and 200s--you're right. Just in the span of two years we have the resurgent ""Pride and Prejudice"" shown in theaters now (November-December, 2005) with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, and just the year before an INDIAN simulacrum appeared called, ""Bride and Prejudice""--after all you can't repeat the same title forever--and it is somewhat resembles Bridget Jones's Diary made a few years back in England (with a sequel to boot). This one (B&P) is a joy to behold, with attractive leads (meaning the women), enticing music--a mixture of Indian strains with western rock--dancing numbers galore, and lively pace. It offers nearly two hours of joyous watching, though little beyond that. The acting is minimal (not that it needs to be anything more), the plot situations--and even some of the dialogue--mere copies of the original story, and the silly situations in the Austen story are no longer pointed satirical shafts but low-level farce played for laughs--as the scenes equivalent to the Mr. Collins incidents indicate. An Indian family, the Bakhsis, with four unmarried daughters and no prospects of good matches in sight needs a meddling mother to nudge things along--and so it happens here. When a prospective groom, Mr. Balraj, arrives from England, he falls in love with Maya, the second oldest. But the scheme is frustrated by a friend of his, a proud American called Will Darcy (Martin Henderson), whose family owns hotels back in L.A., and who is here to transform India into a resort country. He has a stumbling himself, though, as he meets the eldest daughter, the ravishing Lalita (Aishwarya Rai), who stumps him with clever answers--too much for the condescending American. There is also a Mr. Wickham in the story, the usual heel in the Austen stories, who is after Lalita first, sees his prospects there diminishing, and falls for the youngest sister, whom he woos and nearly runs away with. He slanders Darcy of course, and his connivances are not revealed to Lalita until nearly the end, when Darcy proposes to her and she rejects him--on the same grounds Elizabeth rejects Darcy.
This all works up to a point as a story--for the same plot is now being repeated and copied ad infinitum--and the results are relative flabbiness. But there are compensations; the music, the dancing--this is almost a musical--the exotic beauty of Rai, and the sheer energy of this movie carry it along. Find a better Darcy though--or better yet, run a contest of Darcy look-a-likes in L.A. Or ask MacFadyen or Colin Firth to lend a hand to this totering image of a wooer. Or, simply, don't take this Indian gem too seriously but take what for it offers. A light-hearted love story, with its music in it, and the cultural caricatures of at least three cultures--American, English, Indian, or Anglo-Indian and Indian-
American, as the case may be. The movie, cleverly conceived, deftly avoids offending anyone, though it makes fun of everybody. And the play of words--Lalita is not Lolita, as Anne, one of Darcy's girl friends supposes hearing her name. You need the correct pronunciations here. And a  movie of this sort, with that name in it, does not have to be morose, as Kubrick conceived his; rather, it allows itself to indulge into the Jane Austen treasure box once more, for our culture--riddled by terrorism, hatred, racism, and all the other evils we have invented or suffered--and needs a breath of fresh air. Two hundred years ago, during the Age of Enlightenment, some authors knew how to mock the world they lived in and make you love it at the same time. Perhaps, a movie like this makes us wonder if we need to awaken from the horrors we have seen in the last century--and still see--and approach life as a positive thing--love, romance (at any age), dance (at any age), music, and fluffy stuff that painlessly explodes hypocrisy without entirely destroying the hypocrites--their punishment being our laughter. Mix cultures, play more music, let beauties conquer the arrogant, and let the silly being laughed at. But even the silly, in the end, may conceal good hearts. After all, Mr. Collins married Charlotte Lucas. She may have made a human being out of him. And, above all, don't forget to bring Catherine De Bough back--and this movie does in the person of S.M.--for these are the characters that spark laughter, and, ironically, bring the lovers to their liberating union. Lalita may have polluted the shades of Beverly Hills, but we know better. For it is the temperament of the unloved and the spoiled that she has brought down, spoiling their fun, but enhancing ours.

I love Austen, which is why I was leary of watching it, but I am glad I did. It was enjoyable. Not excellent, but good.

The stars were great especially Naveen Andrews and Aishwarya Rai (Ash). She is also stunning.

If you are looking for a fun, relaxing watch, with a few good laughs, this is a movie to see. I think Ms. Austen would really enjoy this.",1189382400,,580,4.115044247787611
2309569,4,B0009PBLRM,"A free-spirited young woman meets a man who, while rich and handsome, initially seems cold and uncommonly rude. After an ironic series of events involving the woman's comically frustrating family and many misunderstandings, she comes to realize that the unfeeling young man is truly a gentleman with a heart of gold.

 If this story sounds familiar, it probably is. Remade many times in movie, television, and book form, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of literature and film's most classic love stories. It may seem, then, that one more turn of this tale would only drive the story further into the ground. But throw in some spicy Bollywood song and dance and it takes new life in the form of the lively film Bride and Prejudice.

 In this colorful and upbeat musical, an American man named Will Darcy (Martin Henderson) travels to India with a friend and unexpectedly meets his match in independent Lalita Bakshi (Bollywood superstar Aishwarya Rai). Although initially wary of the foreign Indian culture, Will is soon drawn to Lalita's easy charm and zest for life. He must convince Lalita and her outrageous family, however, that his veneer of snobbery is not who he truly is in order to win her heart.

 While the Bollywood style of film may be unfamiliar to most Americans, the movie boasts several international stars, including director Gurinder Chadha, most recognizable to western moviegoers for her earlier film, Bend It Like Beckham. Rai also is no stranger to the big screen. Known by many as the ""queen of Bollywood"" and often renowned as ""the most beautiful woman in the world,"" the former Miss World is one of India's most celebrated actresses.

 Some of the movie's finest moments come in the form of musical numbers. Using popular Indian dance and song styles, the film includes several tunes that will keep viewers humming long after the credits have rolled. An additional strength is the brilliant styling and artistry of the film. Bright, eye-popping colors transport the audience to the world of the movie and make the film a visual treat.

 Unfortunately, while the movie excels in artistic quality, it lacks in some acting skills. Henderson's Darcy is fairly lackluster, and Alexis Bledel's turn as his younger sister Georgie makes the viewer wonder if lack of personality runs in the family. A gratuitous music video-esque performance by singer Ashanti chops up the flow of the plot and seems out of place in the middle of the film.

 At its core, though, Bride and Prejudice is a fresh spin on a timeless classic. Rai and several others keep the action lively and fun, and Lalita's ridiculous family makes for sincere laughs throughout. It takes a strong talent to turn a redundant plot into an enjoyable cinematic ride, but Bride and Prejudice does both Jane Austen and modern audiences proud.",1189209600,,2828,4.943037974683544

2309572,4,B0009PBLRM,"'Bride& Prejudice' is a fun, entertaining movie. I think that if you are feeling a little down, this movie will no doubt cheer you up. The movie is based on the story of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen but if the Janeites and other Jane Austen lovers are looking for a faithful adaptation, you might be slightly disappointed. Some situations are different from the book and the names were changed to look more authentic. After all, it is a modern version with a great deal of dancing and singing; The result is that it is more a Bollywood movie which takes up some elements of the original story than an adaptation of the novel. But if you don't know much about the Bolloywood genre, this might be a good start.
Lalita (Aishwarya Rai)is a strong-willed, spirited but idealist young woman who lives in India with her three sisters who are not married yet. Just as Mrs Bakshi is anxious to marry them to rich gentlemen, Baraj ( handsome Naveen Andrews), an English barrister from Indian origin, arrives in India with his sister and his friend, Will Darcy (Martin Handerson), a rich American hotel-owner. Darcy is soon attracted to Lalita but they come from two different backgrounds and not only pride and prejudice oppose them but also their own distinctive cultures...
The dances (the 'No life without wife' is a must-see) are really superb and very creative. It is very colourful (the costumes are exceptional) and the songs are beautiful. Some characters are really irresistible like Mr Koli and you can't help laughing at some delightful situations, at some comments by Mr Koli or at some memorable scenes like the Snake Dance of Lalita's sister, Maya.
'Bride and Prejudice' is not the best movie that you may ever see but you definitely shouldn't miss it. It is a must-see.",1185408000,,1781,4.766990291262136

2309574,5,B0009PBLRM,"Gurinder Chadha produces a fantastic film with a new twist to the classical conundrum: how does an independent minded female connect with the opposite sex? Jane Austen could never in her wildest dreams imagine the outstanding Bollywood like dance and music numbers which make this film such a delightful viewing experience. Ashanti does a magical song and dance called ""Take Me to Love.""  The Bakshi sisters sing and express appropriate sentiment in ""No Life without Wife"" which is a delightful song mocking the awkward attempts by Mr. Kholi, an accountant of Indian background who lives near Hollywood, who returned to Amritsar, India to find himself a wife. Despite his obvious material successes in the USA, which he keeps pointing out to the Bakshi family, he can not connect socially with the right kind of female who appreciates his hard work and who possesses the cultural traits which he is seeking in a wife ... Mrs Bakshi is over-joyed to present and introduce her daughters to him. She wishes to marry her daughters off, one after the other to socially prominent, wealthy successful men, with the goal of climbing to a higher social class. The humorous lyrics of the song and amusing delivery by the Bakshi sisters captures the mood and feeling of the film.

Nor could Jane Austen envision the beautiful Lalita played by one of India's most gorgeous and popular actresses, Aishwarya Rai. Mrs Bakshi plays a well meaning but scheming mother whose main concern is marrying off each of her four daughters to wealthy but worthy gentlemen of suitable families. Mr. Bakshi is a devoted and doting father who worked hard to build his business into a success. It provides his family a comfortable middle class lifestyle, nonetheless it still leaves his wife trying to improve upon the social status of her daughters through suitable marriage matches ... Lalita is the most beautiful and outspoken of the four girls in the Bakshi family. She is pleased her older sister Jaya met a barrister from London, who is of Indian background, whose busy lifestyle prevented him from meeting eligible female companions. He obviously fell head over heels in love with the lovely and quiet Jaya, after returning to Amritsar for exactly the purpose of finding a wife. His sister came along on the trip as did a wealthy American friend whose family is in the hotel business. The American friend, Will Darcy is captivated by the beauty, quick mind and outspoken nature of Lalita. She assertively voices her opinions which is not a trait held in high esteem by most eligible handsome wealthy bachelors. Will discovers Lalita is intriguing and attractive yet is put off by her outspokenness. He occassionally finds himself on the defensive when conversing with her but in the end her ideas cause him to ponder and question his personal values ... and also the ethical motives behind business deals.

Lalita also discovers to her chagrin she is attracted to Will who is a handsome, worthy and intelligent opponent ... At social gatherings they manage to magnetize and repel each other with their heated debates about social and cultural values and differences. To Lalita's surprise, one of her best friends agrees to an arranged marriage to Mr. Kholi ... The Bakshi family is sent an invitaton to the wedding along with economy class airline tickets to attend the ceremony in America. The wedding takes place on the grounds of the magnificent hotel owned by Will Darcy's family. Will takes Lalita on a whirlwind tour of California and the Southwest. She sees a different side to Will Darcy, one she never knew existed. She falls in love with him but then overhears someone whisper how something Will had said to his Indian barrister friend caused the break up of his romance with her sister Jaya ... Lalita is broken hearted and devasted. She confronts Will. He admits the break-up was his fault. The reader must view the film to discover how these two people of such vastly different backgrounds make peace and rekindle their romance and love. In the end it burns brighter than ever. The film is filled with passion, energy, romance, class differences, cultural clashes and to the viewer's immense satisfaciton, a happy ending. It is a colorful pageantry of the sights, sounds, and music of India in the best Bollywood tradition. A most hightly recommended film.

2309575,5,B0009PBLRM,"I did not want to watch this movie. Pride and Prejudice (by Jane Austen) is one of my favorite novels, and I did not want that book to be marred by a stupid comedy. My brother, who has never read Pride and Prejudice, made me watch it (I had fully intended to sneak out of the room once he got into the film). I definitely didn't expect to love this movie; but I do. It was wonderful! This was one of the few GOOD romantic comedies (and it followed the book pretty well).

I'm not going to go into plot much because if you didn't know the plot of Pride and Prejudice before reading this ; I'm sure you picked it up by now from reading other reviews. So, why did I like this movie?

The scripting is wonderful, and even though some characters/situations are changed (not to mention the whole modern setting thing) it keeps the integrity of Pride and Prejudice intact. This is a Bollywood film; and as such the music and dance (a LOT of music and dance)is very different than what I, as an American, am used to. However, it was fun. The tunes were catchy, and most importantly the movie was funny and you ended up caring about the character (though Jane Austen deserves most of the credit for that; the actors did a good job too).

The scenes are all colorful and the setting is just enjoyable to watch. There really isn't much dull time, either. I remarked to my brother that this was like Pride and Prejudice for people with ADHD. Quick moving (the movie is only 112 minutes) and easy to watch.

If you, like me, were reluctant to watch this movie; I ask you to put your prejudice aside and just try it. If you don't get into it I'll be surprised. I watched this movie with family and everyone ended up liking it.

Me, don't like romantic comedies much: LOVED IT
My brother (hasn't read book, 24, not much for musicals)and my
sister-in-law (Chinese, not used to American/English culture, knew very little about the book) both really, really liked it.",1184371200,,1949,4.402777777777778

Yes, the relationships may be idealized, but the portrayals are a refreshing change from the cynacism that permeates our culture. Bride & Prejudice is simply cheerful entertainment; I have seen this movie at least 10 times, and I never tire of it. I highly recommend it, and often foist the DVD off on my friends!

2309580,4,B0009PBLRM,"I love Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and the recent movie adaptations of it (Colin Firth '96 and Keira Knightley '06).  This movie cleverly weds the wit of Austen with the song and dance of Bollywood.  In Bride's family, we get counterparts for elder sister Jane, Mary with her dubiously entertaining ""snake dance,"" and Lydia and her doomed attraction for Wickham; there is no parallel for Elizabeth's sister Kitty. The storyline is pretty comparable and the deleted scenes complete the Lady Catherine/Elizabeth confrontation and Darcy's apology to Bingley.

While the young man who played Darcy was very handsome and came off as quite the gentleman, I thought the actor who played Wickham (Daniel Gillies) took the cake in the hottness factor (at about 5'9"", I tend to be attracted to tall men with nice builds--I like the illusion of feeling petite).  Normally, I'm not competitive with other women in the looks department, but I admit to having been jealous of Aishwarya Rai's intense, angelic beauty.  She has naturally blue-green eyes and auburn-streaked hair, rare coloring for an Indian woman.  I always thought that Brooke Shields and Grace Kelly were arguably the most beautiful women of my awareness, but perhaps Aishwarya is a close third.  Of course, I'm violating the Dalai Lama's admonition to be happy for other people's good fortune with this jealousy of Aishwarya's beauty :-)

I loved the singing and dancing scenes. The director said that she tapered Bollywood Eastern music to Western taste. Ashanti makes an appearance, fusing many different musical styles with her performance.

The guy who plays Mr. Kholi (Mr. Collins) was amusing in his self-indulgent portrayal of a nerdy man who was trying too hard. The mother wasn't quite as obnoxious as Alison Steadman's rendition, but you get the point of a pushy woman with questionable social graces.

One of my favorite things about this movie were the bright colors that pervade every scene.  From the clothing, the interiors, to the backdrop of an Indian village, everything is kodachrome.",1182384000,,2063,5.128358208955224

2309587,3,B0009PBLRM,"The Bollywood production of Bride and Prejudice is a comical, musical, and analytical look at what can happen when a traditional Indian woman and a typical American man fall in love.  The film confronts the theme of clashing cultures, as two couples struggle to build a relationship despite differences in their upbringing and worldviews.  The issue of marrying for love versus a family-approved, arranged marriage situation is addressed, as well.  The movie also focuses on themes of family/friend relationships, as the characters in the movie demonstrate love and loyalty in their friendships and relationships on both sides of the cultural divide.

 The film begins when American hotel heir William Darcy visits India with family friends Balraj and Kiran, Indian natives.  Darcy meets and is immediately attracted to Lalita Bakshi, the film's protagonist.  Lalita, the second-born in a family of daughers, is of ""marrying age,"" and her parents are eager for her to wed.  Her eldest sister, Jaya quickly becomes involved in a romance with Darcy's friend Balraj.  However, Lalita's independent personality clashes with Darcy's, as she becomes increasingly defensive of her Indian culture.  She is more attracted to another American visitor, Johnny Wickham, who Darcy seems distrustful of.  The visitors soon leave, and while Lalita feigns indifference, Jaya becomes lonely and sad.  In a persistent effort, though, Mr. and Mrs. Bakshi continue in their efforts to find husbands for their daughters.  But when the family travels to America for a wedding, Lalita and Jaya meet up with Darcy and Balraj again.  Lalita discovers Johnny Wickham has betrayed her family, and in helping each other, both couples can overcome their personal and cultural conflicts and can finally be in love.

 Not only entertaining, this film also reveals several viewpoints of Indian culture and identity.  It is clear to the viewer that the issue of westernization in India is often in direct conflict with traditional Indian customs.  These issues must be even more challenging for Indian citizens of each new generation.  The movie also has factual information about the country of India itself, especially in scenes where the characters visit and discuss cities like Bombay and Goa.  For these reasons, the movie also serves as an effective instructional tool in analyzing Indian/American cultural differences and similarities.

 This enjoyable movie is highly recommended, especially to those who enjoy romantic comedy, singing and dancing.  It is not, however, purely a guilty pleasure film.  The movie confronts common themes of love and the human condition, while also sparking thought about the similarities and differences between world cultures, and how these issues function in human relationships.  The film can serve as educational, but should be commended on its instructive and educational qualities, as well.",1175990400,,2903,5.426339285714286
2309588,4,B0009PBLRM,"Personally to me the main plot of the movie was the concept in Indian culture that there is, as one of the musicals in the movie informed us, ""no life without wife.""  I feel that this is the plot because the whole movie is based around a man, his wife, and the daughters they are trying to marry off.  The mother spends most of her time trying to find wealthy husbands so that her daughters will have security while the father lets the daughters have a chance at love.  There are many themes in this movie including the first two obvious themes of pride and prejudice.

The movie wanted to show a glimpse of how marriage works in the Indian culture and the kind of prejudice that those with western ideas show for it.  The pride part is seen when the characters in the movie realize that first impressions aren't always correct and sometimes we must swallow our pride to take a chance to find out what we have been missing out on.  We see prejudice from William Darcy because he feels that marriage should be based on love and he thinks Indian moms and their daughters are just gold diggers.  We also see prejudice from Lalita Bakshi who thinks that westerners are just greedy and don't care anything about the true culture and beauty of India, even in the parts that are more run down and more like ""true"" India, unlike that of the big bustling ""westernized"" cities of India.  Both of the characters must break through their pride to see that these ideals are untrue.

 Money and love are a huge theme in the movie; some marriages are based on wealth while others are formed around the love that two people have devoted to each other.  With Indian culture the people feel love is something that will grow with time and commitment while western ideas feel that love must be there from the start before a marriage has taken place.  This also means that there is the idea of western cultures verses eastern cultures.  While western culture views India as a slow-moving, backwards-thinking place eastern culture is viewing western culture as a greedy, capitalistic, cold-hearted society that feels very little towards ""real"" India and her people.

 The importance of this movie is to teach understanding and compassion for new people and ideas that are out of the norm to us.  Even in all its colorful, musical, corniness we can still learn that if we are too prejudice and if we let our pride get in our way that we will miss out on enjoying new people and their culture.  It also teaches us to accept the fact that just because we are used to our own ideals and culture that someone else's isn't wrong. Different people live different ways and what works for one person may not work for someone else.  This work reveals a lot about marriage in the Indian Culture.  Lalita feels that men in the Indian culture (especially those who have been westernized, like Mr. Kohli) only want a little obedient wife but we are shown that in the Indian culture love too is an important part of marriage in India.  She learns that love can grow in a marriage, when she sees how happy her best friend ends up with Mr. Kohli, just as it can be there from the start.",1175472000,,3147,4.516754850088184

The story really does fit well , and the movie is entertaining to watch, but it's difficult to avoid comparing the story and characters to the original. In that aspect, it tends to come up short.

2309595,3,B0009PBLRM,"A fun movie for all the reasons listed below, PLUS a subtle and I'm sure unintended look at how the images that Indian society and American society each proffer differ, as exemplified in their movie treatments.

In this movie, the (poor) child of a servant (a Brit), otherwise wise and culturally sensitive, makes one mistake in adolescence, only to find himself tarred for life.  There is no redemption for your mistakes, especially if you're lower caste.

On the other hand, the culturally insensitive and boorish man (an American), one born into wealth and who has no issues with exploiting the underclasses, is the one who wins the gal - a gal who, ironically, spends much of the film railing against Western cultural imperialism.  To that end the film's preachiness can be unbearable at times as it, with a painful lack of sophistication, attempts to slay the demons of American excess through embarrassingly stupid stereotypes and hackneyed dialogue.

How different than American film treatments!  Americans love a story of redemption, and as an American viewer I expected the poor and downtrodden striver to prevail.  But in a land of castes, it was the scion who trumps all.  He's high caste, and you just don't knock those people down even if they are jerks - cute and naive jerks, but jerks nonetheless.

Still, enjoy the movie!  The above is not an indictment but an observation.  It's tons of fun - colorful, silly, with good energy and some genuinely touching moments.  And like I said, beyond that, I feel like I learned a lot....",1170720000,,1544,4.873563218390805

2309598,5,B0009PBLRM,"I can't say I am a fan of musicals. I find most musicals to be annoying (like ""Grease""), ""Bride & Prejudice"" isn't one of those annoying musicals. ""Bride & Prejudice"" is one of my favorite films from 2004, if not all time favorite film. The film is loosely (and I mean loosely) based on Jane Austen's ""Pride & Prejudice"" which is given a Bollywood treatment.

India's biggest film star Aishwarya Rai plays Lalita Bakshi, the second eldest daughter in the Bakshi family. Her mother is obsessed with marrying off her four daughters to well to do suitors as quickly as possible. This doesn't sit well with Lalita because she is strong-willed, independent, and doesn't want to settle for any man. When Lalita meets the wealthy William Darcy (Martin Henderson of ""Torque"" and ""The Ring""), sparks immediately flys between the two but so does strong opinions as well. Lalita also meets up with a grifter named Johnny Wickham (Daniel Giles) who shares a past with Darcy.

The good: I loved the music. The music was irresistably catchy. The first time I saw this film in the theatre, the music immediately got stuck in my head. The songs had the right hooks to leave an immediate impression on me. I just loved the musical numbers period. The comic relief of Nitin Ganatra as Mr. Kohli, the would be suitor of Lalita. Nitin is absolutely hilarious as the goofy, obnoxious but kind Mr. Kohli. The costumes were absolutely beautiful. Loved the outtakes during the credits at the end of the film.

The not so good: the writing of the film is a bit spotty but if you watch the behind the scenes making of the film, Gurinder Chadha explains how she wanted to capture the essence of the Jane Austen novel. Anyone who is expecting a word for word interpretation of ""Pride & Prejudice"" will be sorely disappointed in the film. I wished Gurinder would have been a bit more detailed about Johnny Wickham's past.

DVD features: there is a fifteen minute behind the scenes footage of the making of the film, extended musical numbers, and interviews with Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai.

Overall ""Bride and Prejudice"" is a massively fun film to watch. The music is catchy. The pace of the storyline is brisk and never slows down for a moment. Great cast. I never tire of watching this delightful film.",1169164800,,2283,4.711779448621554
2309599,4,B0009PBLRM,"Rich American Mr. Darcy (Martin Henderson) meets strong-willed and beautiful Lalita (Aishwayra Rai) in Amritsa, India. They dislike each other because of a slight misunderstanding, and then find themselves attracted to one another after knowing more about the other. There are sub-plots to the main story, about Lalita's meddling mother, tormented father, and sisters and their suitors (and lovely cobra dance that you should not miss), the love story told in Bollywood fashion is absorbing enough.

Gurinder Chadha's ""Bride and Prejudice"" is in fact a delightful combination of romantic comedy and Bollywood-style musical. The film is, as you know, a loose adaptation of Jane Austen novel, but though the storyline follows the original's pretty faithfully (except cultural background), the film, unlike the incisive narrative of Austen's book,  refrains from commenting about the difference of culture between the East and the West, stressing the fun part of so-called Bollywood films.

The film does not take itself very seriously and it works. You may find the film is too light and Henderson's Mr. Darcy looks a bit too sweet and definitely less glum-looking than Colin Firth, but that light-heartedness is, I think, is exactly the point. Anyone who has seen Indian-made films would notice that not all real `Bollywood' films are merry and happy throughout its long story. Many of them actually deal with serious social issues and moreover, often end with tragedy. `Bride and Prejudice' observes several conventions of the films made in India, but not them, pessimism or fatalism that I find obtrusive or even off-putting.

So please don't try to seek Jane Austen or Bollywood films here. This is a well-made romantic comedy `inspired by' Jane Austen and `shot in the style' of Bollywood films. It's a joy to watch.",1169164800,,1819,5.240549828178694

I personally think that Jane Austen might of sat up in her grave if she had seen this movie. But besides that. The movie had me laughing, singing and dancing. Starring the wonderful Aishwarya Rai and Martin Henderson in the roles of Lalita(modern day Elizabeth) and Will Darcy, the on screen chemistry between the two is great. Set in modern day India, the movie tells the basic plot of the book with a few different aspects, like there is no Aunt Catherine, they put in Will's mother instead, who towards the end of the movie comes up against Lalita, and of course Lalita wins the small battle. I think the thing that bothered me most about the movie, is how rushed the end is, I wanted the remainder of the story to keep going, but it just seemed that once the general plot was completed, the end was just a throw together. But once again, the music, dancing and the wonderful colors of the movie makes up for the rushed ending. I enjoyed this weird but recent update to the Pride and Prejudice fanchise, and I would recommend this colorful update to anyone who wants to see the movie but add a little bit more spice to the regular story.",1166400000,,1312,4.493723849372385

2309611,4,B0009PBLRM,"Okay...I'll take a pass on doing a profound, pick-it-to-pieces review and will only say that this is a fun, fun movie!  Some may think it lacks character development, but P&P's been adapted for film at least 7 times by my count.  We know the characters.  No need to expound on them here.  A nice introduction to Bollywood, albeit Bollywood ""lite"" indeed, for those who aren't familiar with the genre.

I'm careful to note the film isn't an adaptation of P&P, but if you read the credits, is inspired by it.  Classic story, timeless elements, great song and dance numbers (in particular my favorites are the ""Balle, Balle"" wedding dance, ""No Life Without Wife"", and the Garba) and likeable characters.  Many reviews gave Martin Henderson the short shrift, but I thought he made a charming Darcy with just the right amount of pretension, but still vulnerable enough to root for.  I'm particularly in love with the character of Kholi, played by Nitin Ganatra.  His portrayal provided just the right amount of comic relief without being too over the top.  So many funny moments!  I loved it!

I just bought the movie last weekend and have already watched it 4 times, loving it more each time than the last.  You won't be disappointed.",1162771200,,1230,4.7725118483412325
2309612,3,B0009PBLRM,"If you are looking to get a feel for what a Bollywood movie might be like, this will give you a taste, while still being grounded in the more familiar English and American styles.  Filmed mostly in England, there were exterior scenes filmed in India and the United States as well.  ""Bride & Prejudice"" was first released in the United Arab Emirates on October 6th of 2004, which was shortly followed by its release in India, the United Kingdom and France on October 8th.  One interesting fact mentioned in the commentary, is that it was the number one film in both India and the United Kingdom when it opened, which no other film has ever done.  The film was not released in the United States until February 11th of 2005.

As one might easily guess, this is an adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", adding in the Bollywood musical numbers, and updating the story to be about a wealthy American, William Darcy (Martin Henderson), and a poor Indian woman, Lalita Bakshi (Aishwarya Rai), who is one of four daughters that her mother is trying to marry off.  This movie is at times hilariously funny, and at other times cheesily romantic.  The movie was directed by Gurinder Chadha, who also directed ""Bend It like Beckham"" (2002).

The best moments of the movie for me were the songs ""Marriage Song"", and ""No Life without Wife"", and the hilarious snake dance scene.  The weaknesses were in some of the acting, in particular for the role of William Darcy.  I am not very familiar with Martin Henderson, so I am not sure if the problem was acting or direction, but I thought the performance was very wooden overall.  I think the movie also suffered from being based on a fairly long book, so they had to cut it down a lot, especially to fit in the long elaborate musical numbers.

The DVD has a nice set of features, including deleted scenes, extended versions of the songs, Ashanti's song, a featurette on the making of ""Bride & Prejudice"", interviews with Aishwarya Rai and Martin Henderson, and a feature length commentary by Gurinder Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges.  I would not call this a great movie, but I certainly was entertained by it.  Overall, I would like to give it 3  stars because this is clearly above average, however Amazon doesn't allow reviewers to do that.  So in choosing between 3 and 4 stars, I would have to say it is closer to a 3 star item than a 4 star one",1162512000,,2393,4.569086651053865
2309613,4,B0009PBLRM,"Ok, first off - I normally have a STRONG distaste for Aishwariya Rai.  Second, I am a BIG fan of Jane Austen and third, a big fan of the BBC rendition of Pride & Prejudice.  (Surprised?)

BUT I like this movie.  I agree this is no Bend it Like Beckham but then again, what is?  It's the Matrix of cross-culture movies - unique and well, fun to watch.

Why Do I like this movie??
1.  The song ""No life without wife,"" sums up how it is in many cultures all around the world.  This is not an Indian problem.  It's a global way of thinking that no one can be happy without being ""settled"" - unfortunately, society always makes all of us feel incomplete if we don't have someone by a certain age.  Also, the song is just so silly with it's stupidly catchy tune, and then 'Kholi' in 'Kholiwood'roaring like an animal - all of it mixed together cracks me up!

2.  Namrata Shirodkar is a beautiful woman.  She makes a lovely Jane.  (She is better looking than Aish in my opinion and has been forced to look plain here...oh, the irony!)

3.  Lakhi (Peeya Rai Chowdhary) is one of my favorite `Lydias.'  She is just so fun to watch - her little actions and movements just grasp you.  For instance, when Kholi is eating at the dinner table, watch her imitating him - small moments like these make you like this movie.  She is just so vibrant and young and nave that the role of Lydia suits her well.

4.  The character of Mr. Bennet seems a bit more intelligent in this production.  I like that, and I think it goes well with the novel.  Anupam Kher has a substantial quality I find lacking in a lot of `Mr. Bennets.'  (Except in the BBC production.)

5.  I love the fact that Ashanti was in this.  Her song and dance was enjoyable.  In an interview with her, she says how much fun she had being in Goa and getting to do something different and new.

6.  Sightseeing is always a must in ""Indian"" movies - at least here, when we're in London, we're actually IN London, etc. A lot of Indian movies have characters saying they're in Goa and then show scenes for Switzerland.  It's very weird....

7.  This movie is a clash of three cultures.  British, American, and conservative Indian - and yes, there are differences.  It's done a bit more seamlessly than I thought it could.  Details are what make up the bulk of this movie.

8.  Some mothers are annoying and embarrassing, no matter what culture!

Overall, I liked this movie for what it was trying to do:  Show some color to the world in a light-hearted way.  I have many things I didn't like in this movie, but I will stick to the niceties for now.  I would rather give a 3 and 1/2 stars but I can't on Amazon.  Watch the movie with an open mind - leave your brain at home as if you were about to watch Jackass or a Steve Martin movie.  A lot of things seems bizarre in the movie, but that's how life is!",1161648000,,2846,4.239252336448598
2309623,5,B0009PBLRM,"When my wife asked me to see this movie, I didn't think much about watching a movie about weddings.  But what it turned out to be is this is one of the best movies I ever saw, and helped me appreciate Indian culture better. (Kinda like the main character, Darcy, of the movie.)  Even though there are no suprises here, this movie made me think about the about the theme of the movie, which is class-distinction between ""westerners"" and ""easterners"".  And any media or movie that helps unite people, and learn about other cultures in the process is a great movie.  The Bride and Prejudice DVD brings romance, wit, and emotional force to your home.  By the way, if you saw ""The New Yorker"" review calling this movie a travesty and ridiculous and enjoyable, just completely disregard that kind of review; it's like the weatherman telling you it is going to rain and be sunny on a particular day.",1161388800,,892,4.584905660377358

Wickham. Give me another break! In the original, he is a charming poor guy who sweeps vulnerable and strong women alike off their feet into doomdom.  In this version, I could not see, for the life of me, why anybody would want to spend a minute alone with this fellow let alone the rest of their life. His charm, if anything, was unconvincing.

The storyline was cute, but the actors did not have enough screen presence to carry this time old tale.",1157846400,,725,4.43609022556391

2309627,5,B0009PBLRM,"This is one of the best movies I've seen this year.

It's an updated Bollywood version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice that's just terrific.  It's a family story, a love story and has some very funny moments as well. The cast is great and included Naveen Andrews from Lost.

It's touching, funny and has great musical numbers (which my husband and I liked so much we also bought the soundtrack :)  Highly recommended!",1154044800,,422,4.662162162162162
2309628,5,B0009PBLRM,"The movie begins in a welter of confusion, but I guess all versions of PRIDE and PREJUDICE share the problem of having to sort out five (in this case four) daughters of an avaricious and greedy mother, plus the best friend of one of them, so you have all these girls ""of a marriageable age"" and it takes a little while to realize who is who.  As many have noted, however, BRIDE AND PREJUDICE has the incomparable advantage of luscious Aishwarya Rai, so you know right away that she is the heroine.

She is like a tall, and much younger version of Vanessa Williams, the disgraced former Miss America who made a magnificent comeback as a singing star later in her career.  Rai's pipes don't have the power nor the punch of Vanessa's, but she has something else, a vulnerable frailty that convinces us that, even as she plays the meanest Elizabeth Bennet on record, she really isn't as bad as she makes herself out to be.  Lalita gets annoyed at Darcy for the least little thing, and we don't really understand why (except for general post-colonial reasons), to the point at which we would really start to dislike her if it weren't the divine Aish playing her.  She is so beautiful and seems so warm, even when she's playing hard to get or positively spiteful.

Marsha Mason is simply no match for Aish, so the contest never really takes off as it might.  Why didn't they get a real spitfire to play the Lady Catherine de Bourgh part--someone like Kathleen Turner?  Or you know who would have been good--Jessye Norman!  As it stands, Marsha Mason looks like she'd rather be somewhere else, perhaps eating the dinners of two or three of her co-stars, than actually acting in the same movie with them.

The one song, ""Show Me The Way, Take Me to Love,"" just gets better and better each time it is reprised, and the Los Angeles version with the surfers swaying their boards in time to the beat, and the blue-robed gospel choir singers trailing Darcy and Lalita across Venice Beach is outstanding, worthy of George Sidney or Stanley Donen or Vincente Minnelli.  Martin Henderson isn't very commanding playing Darcy, but he'll do in a pinch, and the movie makes the most of the chemistry he evolves with La Rai, which by the last reel is smoldering hot!",1153267200,,2245,4.5875
2309629,4,B0009PBLRM,"I thought it was a very nice movie. It was beautiful, romantic and it was also a musical. It's interesting enough to sit through it and not get bored. The story is already known, but they sure made a good movie out of it. Great to watch with loved ones.",1150761600,,253,4.08
2309630,5,B0009PBLRM,"""Pride and Prejudice"" has been one of my favorite books ever since I first read it, and this is a stunning new twist for it. It takes the classic story and adds so much sparkle that it's impossible not to love it! From the very moment it starts, you know you are in for a treat.

Aish does an amazing job; she is a natural star. She alone makes the movie shine. But add her talent to the catchy songs, (who <u>doesn't</u> love ""No Life Without Wife?"")amazing costumes, and bright colors and scenery, and this movie becomes a definite masterpiece. It is such a different world from the one created in Jane Austen's book, but it is one so vivid and dazzling that you can't help but be enthralled by it.

This movie is great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone! (although be forewarned; you will be humming these songs for days!)

For that purpose the selection of theme -- a reinterpretation of the English classic novel by Jane Austen, ""Pride and Prejudice"" -- was perfect. Every culture has its mating rituals and marriage customs. Those of early nineteenth-century Britain turn out not to be so different from twenty-first century India, especially the maternal desire to arrange for marrying off the daughters. We are all just one big human race after all.

Although vastly different from Austen's original story, there is plenty of wit to go around.  The outlandish plot devices are no more ridiculous than the match-making Mrs. Bennett in the novel.  Without a strong lead in the Darcy role, our focus is on the young women whose mother is so intent on marrying them off.

That said, Naveen Andrews really cuts a rug in the dance sequences, and the Mr. Collins character steals every scene in which he appears.",1145232000,,675,4.537190082644628

There's bound to be some sparks

He's just a little bland

They could have found a better bloke

To take Lalita's hand

2309639,4,B0009PBLRM,"This is a Bollywood version of Pride and Predjudice. It's light hearted and a lot of fun. The actress who played the mother was charming and my favorite character was the rejected suitor from LA. His determination to go back to the US with a wife in tow and his sheer delight in his tacky house made me laugh. One more good thing about the film is that Ashanti's ""big role"" consists of a ""song"" and dance number that goes on for all of two or three seconds. If you blink you will mercifully miss  her.

I enjoyed the singing and dancing and I love how in a Bollywood film you can have two hours of romance and nobody gets anything more serious than a peck on the forehead until the wedding day.  That's more chaste than a Disney movie. However, I do have a few nitpicks. First, Lalita, the Lizzie Bennet character is too mean to Darcy. The man is uncomfortable at the first wedding and she jumps all over him. But why shouldn't he be uncomfortable? He's standing smack dab in a totally alien situation. Second, I thought that Wyckham's character was toned down too much. Mr. Wyckham was a thoroughly despicable person and in Bride and Predjudice he comes off as being no worse than a frat boy on Saturday night. Third, they made Darcy way too laid back and soft. The attraction between him and Lalita never really seemed to make sense even for a musical.",1142208000,,1354,4.408
2309640,4,B0009PBLRM,"Transplanting the plot of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to modern India sounded like a stretch to me but it works. Purists will scoff but this version maintains the wit, social commentary, and heart of the original story. An Indian family with 4 daughters (seems Kitty wasn't necessary to the plot) has a mother determined to wed the girls before they get too old. At a wedding, they are introduced to the Bingley character and his sister (they eliminated the Hursts) and Darcy (a rich American).  So there's the cross cultural problems and the class problems and the resultant misunderstandings.

Now add to this the Bollywood musical numbers and set piece and you have a wonderfully, delightful retelling that's original and moving. And if you listen carefully, lines directly from the book are used and fit naturally into the dialogue. A surprising treasure.",1141776000,,865,5.041958041958042
2309641,5,B0009PBLRM,"I absolutely loved this movie after I saw it.  At first I thought I would not because of the music.  I really do not like musicals too much, but this movie and its music is great.  I love to listen to the songs on this movie.  The plot is good also and was pretty close to the general ideas of the Jane Austen novel!

The only thing that disappointed me and that I am still trying to figure out is why there are 2 different versions of the movie.  When I rented the movie and saw it the first time, it had all of the song full lenght and it had various extra scenes when they were in Goa, including one where Kiran slights the neighborhood where Jaya's and Lahlita's aunt and uncle live in London.  Luckily I taped this version because when I went to buy the movie it turns out that the movie I bought had cut a lot of the songs and cut alot of the Goa scenes including the one I mentioned above.  This is unfortunate because the movie that I bought is collecting dust while I keep watching what I call, the full version from what I taped!",1141257600,,1039,4.083743842364532
2309642,5,B0009PBLRM,"I first saw this on cable while channel surfing and was almost immediately hooked. I got on the Amazon site and ordered it as soon as the movie ended (no lie).  Like some reviewers here, I had no idea what I was in for (Holy Smokes, Batman, folks are Singing and Cavorting!); but it very quickly won me over. I'd read and enjoyed Austen's Pride and Prejudice and had seen the Greer Garson,as well as the Colin Firth, movie renderings. Bride and Prejudice is a refreshing take, slanted towards a different culture. I'm sure I've missed some nuances that only those of Indian heritage could properly take in and appreciate, but I still got bang for my buck.

The absolute star of 'Bride' is Aishwarya Rai, who has a blend of exotic beauty and down-to-earth personality that enchanted the hell out of me. The director, Gurinder Chadha (Kick It Like Beckham), uses exuberant colors in this flick like Americans must've used liquor the day Prohibition was abolished; and the music and dancing harken back to the days of Busby Berkeley, with a decidedly Bombay flavor. I wish I could go to Vons or Ralph's and witness a full-on Bollywood song & dance break out. Someone who'd posted earlier used the word ""good natured"" in reviewing this movie and that is the perfect description; this is an innately cheerful flick and I guarantee that you, movie fan, will end up humming the ""No Life - Without Wife"" number all day. And, lastly, o verily yea, Aishwarya Rai is undoubtedly the most beautiful woman in the universe.",1140998400,,1509,4.690566037735849

I know all the songs by heart and even know the dances. Whenever customers see this movie on they always ask where they can find it. This movie is so special to my heart because it along with ""Bend it Like it Like Beckham"" introduced me to Bollywood. For anyone who wants to experience Bollywood this is the movie for you!!!",1139788800,,670,3.9338235294117645
2309656,4,B0009PBLRM,"Let's say right up front that Bride & Prejudice was never meant to be an ""authentic step by step translation"". It was meant to be a fun musical, with a ton of gorgeous Indian color, with the general theme of a famous book. I'll be doing this review from this point of view. It's silly to argue that ""Darcy should have been more X to match the book"" or that ""Lizzie shouldn't speak with slang"". It's the themes that matter - not the exact specifics.

The movie is interested because it was deliberately set up to appeal equally to English-speaking audiences as well as Indian natives. In fact, the first song is done completely in Indian. 99% of the actors and actresses are Indian. In fact, some scenes are very strongly pro-Indian and anti-West. But we'll get to that in a moment.

Darcy is a US friend of Balraj (Bingley), an Indian guy returned to India for a wedding. England/US is set up as the ""elegant cultured"" high class society of the book, while the small Indian town is set up as the ""back water sludge"" of Lalita's (Lizzie's) hometown. At the party, Darcy very clearly is ""uncomfortable"" with the culture he didn't understand - NOT ""snobbish"" and considering himself above it. He didn't know how to do the dances. In the book, the point was that he DID know how to (very well) but considered himself above it.

Two seconds later we have another song, where the whole town demands more weddings to have fun. At this point I have to comment that with the VERY long musical numbers in an under-2-hour movie, it cuts down on the minutes you can have character development. Some musicals - like Chicago and Grease - have musical numbers that are incredibly important to the story and do amazing jobs of filling out a character's personality. These numbers here have color and glitz but pretty much no ""story meaning"". I really wish they could have made the musical numbers more integral to the movie itself.

Next comes one of the scenes I liked the least. After the wedding, Darcy comes up to talk to Lizzie. He mentions the problem's he's having at the hotel. She gets snappy and lures him into an argument by asking him questions and then arguing with his truthful responses. He dislikes arranged marriages. She pushes him and he agrees that it was the groom's choice. So she fights with that too! Then she kicks up the fight to say all Americans are arrogant. She doesn't come across as intelligent. She comes across as incredibly grumpy.

On to the beach. Caroline teases Lalita about reading a big book and Lalita is nasty back about Caroline's make-up. When Caroline makes a dig about Lalita being accomplished, Lalita says proudly, ""Maybe."" She then jumps on Darcy as being an Imperialist, because anybody who builds a hotel here is obviously harming the local economy with such an action. Darcy tries to talk to her and she refuses.

In the book the main message is that Darcy stands back because of pride. Lizzie is genuinely nice, and even when she criticizes she does it with a smile. We don't get that at ALL here. Here, Darcy tries to fit in when he can and stands back when he's unsure what to do. Lizzie is downright nasty. I have to wonder just why Darcy keeps trying.

Wickham doesn't come across as 'bad' at all - if anything, Lucky chases him down and he reluctantly gives in. The Collins character isn't obsequious or hung up on the pride of working for another - he's made his own way and is lonely.

I realize of course this is a fun musical version. However, it seems like they made ALL characters much blander. I admit that I feel very attached to the ""Lizzie"" character so to see her turned into a nasty grump really upset me. I normally love the Darcy character so to have him such a wimpy non-charismatic man didn't appeal to me. Wickham lost his ""edge"". Collins lost his ""sleaze"".

I watched the movie several times to see if it'd grow on me. I adored the colors, dances and gorgeous Indian scenery - but I still just didn't connect with any characters in the story. It's great eye candy, but the powerful story of human beings got lost somewhere in the translation.",1139270400,,4103,4.548780487804878

In fact it fostered a curiosity to watch it I think, because every five minutes he was asking me about various characters and if it was the same as Jane Austen's book.

However, I do love the songs. I know some people that I had to convince to watch this, but thoroughly enjoyed it once they did (my husband included). Even though it doesn't follow the original story exactly, it is a great rendition of an old tale.",1137283200,,675,4.451612903225806
2309661,4,B0009PBLRM,"As I'm a big fan of Pride and Prejudice, I like to watch movie versions of it.  I heard reviews of this film and thought, ""Uh-oh. I won't like it."" But, it turns out, I did enjoy it!

This movie is really a musical sent in India which might be enough to send some of you running for the drama section at Blockbuster.  I thought so as well. It irritates me to have characters in movies burst into song at vital moments of the plot. Thankfully, these musical numbers don't interfere with the plot but provide an entertaining glimpse of India and what they can do with choreography and some jazzy music.  I liked one song and dance scene so well that I watched it twice.  (The one at the party--women are like kites...) Plus, the main characters never sing a love song to each other, which always feels a bit sappy. (There are only five or six songs in the movie. Don't expect the format of Chicago!)

The story line is that of Pride and Prejudice except everyone has Indian names (of which I do not know the correct spelling, so I'll refer to characters by their Austen names).  The characters are the same, except there is no ""Kitty.""  Also ""Catherine de Bourgh"" is Darcy's mom. But, it all fits well.

This film is pretty mild compared to other PG-13 films I've seen.  Unless there were suggestive lyrics in some of the songs which I just didn't catch, the only objectionble parts occured when her sisters are teasing ""Lizzy"" about ""Mr. Collins.""  They sing about reasons why he might be worth marrying and one line is ""Wonder if he's good in bed?"" Then there is a five-second shot of ""Mr. Collins"" in tight undies and a shirt lying on a bed letting out a growl. Also, ""Lizzy"" sings that she wants a man who will look at her intelligence and not ""at her rack.""

If you think you'd enjoy a funny movie with excellent choreography and some traditional Indian dancing or if you are a big fan of Pride and Prejudice and don't mind whatever vehichle it inhabits, then I highly recommend the film to you!",1137196800,,1998,4.4141689373297

2309663,3,B0009PBLRM,"Sky Blurb: ""The classic romance goes Bollywood in Austen-tatious style. Indian mega babe Aishwarya Rai stars in spicy extravaganza full of song, dance and Darcy.""

This blurb pretty much sums up the movie. It is a feel good movie containing some Bollywood superstars. Combining Indian culture and basic movie structure with British wit, the movie has an obvious, yet interesting storyline. Some of the acting in the movie is rough around the edges, however this does not make the viewers stop watching the captivating plot unfold.

The first piece of the story is set in India. It shows the classic stereotype of the culture; the first chapter is of an Indian arranged marriage. Also, it portrays the classic ""mother in law"", in this case the mother of the main character. It shows her trying to hook up her daughters with the best, richest business men from America (obviously with Indian roots). However, the candidate that the mother picked was arrogant and disgusting. The plot thickens when two white guys go for the main girl of the story. She is a stubborn girl who does not want to marry just for the riches, she wants something more.

Like in most Indian movies, the Indian family goes on vacation to London and then to America. Aishwarya Rai falls for the American Darcy, however she is betrayed and Darcy becomes the enemy.

To make a long story short (Thank god not as long as a real Indian movie) there is a  classic Bridget Jones type ending involving Darcy being blown out of the picture and the other white guy getting the main girl.",1135900800,,1549,4.722222222222222
2309664,5,B0009PBLRM,"My best friend's family introduced me to the world of Bollywood several months ago with two excellent films: ""Chokher Bali"" and ""Bride and Prejudice"". Although worlds apart from each other (""Chokher Bali"" is a dark tragedy without humor, while ""Bride"" is funny and bright), both were awesome examples of the films to be found in this genre.

I was captured immediately by the dance scene at the wedding, with the men courting the women and vice-versa. So beautiful, and so much fun! And the dance in the street was great too--I found myself singing along with them, and when the sisters later sang ""No Life Without Wife"", I sang along then too! Such catchy songs, and they still give you the feel of India. The costumes were gorgeous!

Of course, Aishwarya was wonderful, as always. And I fell in love with Naveen Andrews when I first saw him on the show ""LOST""--imagine my surprise and joy to find him as one of the stars in this film! I recommend this film whole-heartedly to everyone who enjoys a fun romantic comedy and musical talent.",1135900800,,1039,4.672131147540983
2309665,5,B0009PBLRM,"WOW! I'm not much of a musical type person, but this film literally blew me away! I can't watch it enough!!!! Rai and Henderson were perfect for the parts, and the music was awesome!!! The costumes were also amazing as were the scene locals.

The only problems I had was when Mr. Bakshi flew to Britain so soon after Lakhi disappeared and Balraj proposing to Jaya when Lakhi was missing. It would seem impossible for Mr. Bakshi to get from India to London in such a short period of time when I believe the minimum flight from India to England is 16 hrs. The other problem was when Balraj proposed to Jaya, seeing Lakhi is missing it would seem somewhat incongrous to have Jaya even think of accepting the proposal when her sister was missing, or have Balraj propose when such a serious problem was occuring.

Other than those to minor things the movie was awesome!!!!!

My favorite part had to be when Henderson showed up at the door in London to see Lalita with his hair all a mess. (He was SO HOT!!!)It just goes to show how much she meant to him that he'd chase her halfway around the world just to apologize. Then that glance that Lalita and Will shared when Mama Bakshi asked Balraj if he had any cousins for Lalita because they seemed so heartbroken.

I think the best cinematic/directed scene was when Lalita ran away from Will after he told her he loved her. The contrast between the two was so great. The color clothing, the clash of cultural music everything was perfect.

2309668,5,B0009PBLRM,"Bride and Prejudice is a well-executed, charming, colorful and musical adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (only seldomly does it deviate from its source's plotline).

This review could easily concentrate on the merits of this film in terms of entertainment--that there is great comedy (there is); that the singing and dancing are a lot of fun (it is); that the women are beautiful (they are)--but instead I want to comment on what is, perhaps, the lovliest aspect of this film. The fact of its creation, and presentation, shows me almost more than anything before how the world can set aside all differences and come together in the name of art.

In the first place, it is an Indian film adapting one of the most famous English novels in world history. It is in English, but uses an Indian musical style. By shifting the settings of the original, it takes Austen's original commentary on silly prejudices between the upper-crust and country and applies them to the prejudices that the western world maintains about the third world, and vice-versa (if that isn't swift, I don't know what is). It is filmed in India, London and Los Angeles, and pays respect to the strengths of all three venues, honoring all.

A couple of the Los Angeles sequences jumped out at me, as when the Liz Bennett and D'Arcy of this film have a romantic dinner in an L.A. Mexican restaurant, serenaded by a mariachi band, or when they're on the beaches of Santa Monica, as a black church choir ala AME sings an Indian ballad with their distinctive song stylings. This is true culture-blending, using various elements of different cultures from around the world--calling on all of their virtues--to present one story which is, at heart, a story about overcoming misunderstandings and the prejudices that keep us apart.

I'd always known that great storytelling was universal. Bride and Prejudice is proof of it, and also a great movie for a variety of other, more typical reasons that the other reviews here are certain to mention. Absolutely wonderful.",1133740800,,2040,4.904347826086957

The plot devices to keep the lovers-to-be apart were totally contrived and false, and the dramatic ending in the movie theater was so ridiculous it ruined the last bit of any respect I might have had for this movie.

I absolutely loved this movie, nearly everything about it from the music and dancing in the musical numbers (which break out at random intervals) to the acting to the intertwining stories of romance and heartbreak.  Standout actors were the incredible Aishwarya Rai (Lalita) and the comic relief of Nitin Ganatra as Mr. Kholi, the gauche returnee from America shopping for a bride.

It was also lovely to see Naveen Andrews outside of ""Lost"" and just wish there could have been a bit more of him and his storyline with Lalita's sister.

The movie is in English but sometimes when the speech gets rolling quickly, the accents can make a scene a bit hard to follow, but since I want to watch this movie again and again I will get it all eventually.  Or you can do what I do sometimes when I have trouble following thick Aussie or British accents on a DVD--turn on the subtitles.

For someone like me unfamiliar with Bollywood and the amazingly beautiful AND talented Aishwarya Rai, this is a great introduction to both, and like me, I'll bet that you will want to see more of both.  The exuberant music and dancing are what stayed with me the most from this movie, and I think that queuing up the opening wedding dance scene or the ""No Life Without Wife"" number will cheer me up on any grumpy day.

2309675,3,B0009PBLRM,"I was awaiting this movie for months. I was sure I'd love it completely. Jane Austen's novel is one of my favorite pieces of literature and Gurinder Chadha's previous film, Bend It Like Beckham, blew me away. While I will say it is unfair to compare this film to Chadha's ""Beckham"" and on that alone condemn it, it is certainly true that because of the brilliant and well-formed work she did there, I found ""Bride"" to be a double disappointment.

I am a fan of musicals. I am a fan of Pride and Prejudice. I am a fan of Gurinder Chadha's previous work. I am a lover of Indian culture. By all rights, I should have adored this. I am fairly confident that had it been it's own, original story I would have.  But it seemed to me that the film spent too much time and too much of the actors' skills on trying to fit into the ""Pride & Prejudice"" mold and got so tangled up in its own plot, it had nothing to do but...splat.

Make no mistake, it was a beautiful, colorful, effusive, musical, and altogether lovely looking splat...but a splat nonetheless. In the book ""Pride & Prejudice"", Elizabeth's dislike of Darcy is perfectly warranted (prejudiced, yes, but warranted just the same). In the film, her Indian counterpart was simply overreacting. ""Darcy"" never really does anything to draw the viewer's ire and ""Elizabeth"" spends much of the film doing nothing more than acting like a spoilt child (a waste of the acting talent Indian model/actress Aishwarya Rai has) unless of course, she's singing. Indeed, the musical numbers were for me one of the only parts of the movie I could stop being annoyed. They were truly wonderful, full of color, culture, creative choreography and top notch vocals (though at times more cloying that charming). Throughout the rest of the movie, however, it was as if, for some inexplicable reason (perhaps to draw in a larger audience?) the filmakers tried to force the Pride and Prejudice plot on Bride and Prejudice characters, which simply weren't compatible. As a female friend of mine commented after watching: ""I liked Darcy from the beginning--Darcy! You aren't supposed to like him from the first! You're supposed to be upset with him for insulting Elizabeth and being a stuck-up prat."" Indeed, Lalita is the one who is both proud and prejudiced, enough so for the both of them; Darcy's just caught in the middle, a likeable if not slightly bumbling American with a detestable, materialistic, Queen Bee archetype for a mother.

In conclusion, the musical numbers were fantastic (if you go for that sort of thing), I enjoyed seeing ""Lost"" star Naveen Andrews as Balraj Bingley, and the man portraying the equivalent of Mr. Collins (whose name I am, regrettably unsure of--I believe it is Nitin Ganatra, though don't hold me to that) was satisfyingly unlikeable. However, the plot was forced, at the loss of credibility and character development, and I was left wondering what in the world went wrong with a movie I was so destined to enjoy. Ah, such is life I suppose. And it is a truth universally acknowledged that the more you ""know"" you're going to love something, the more likely you are to be let down.

My real rating is closer to 2 and 3/4 stars: not quite enough for a full three, not bad enough for only two, but since I'm an optimist I went with 3. ;)

The final word:  Rent first! Buy it if you're charmed by all means. It seems if you actually take the time to watch it (and aren't forced to do so like my male, teenage cousin who fake-gags everytime you mention but the title) you come out with one of the following opinions:  Either you love it and must own it (like my  sister) or, find that while you liked parts of it, the parts you didn't like eclipse the ones you did leaving you glad you watched it once, but too let down to watch it again.

The REAL Final Word:  A thank you to Gurider Chadha for doing what she does. She is wonderful at it...and despite my less-than-happy feelings towards this film, I am certainly still looking forward to her next one.",1129852800,,4013,4.5986013986013985
2309676,5,B0009PBLRM,"I loved this! To me it is like Emma and Clueless were to LA - this is Pride and Prejudice to India. the essence of Austen taken on by a different culture. It is immensely colourful and rather than stick completely to the plot has allowed the vibrant colour and issues of a modern day india translate their own issues within the framework of Austen.

It is enormously good natured and richly colourful. This is not just the characters but also the costumes - and whoever did the cinematography WOW!

Lalita, the second daughter of the Bakshirs takes on the role of 'Elizabeth' in the traditional Pride and Prejudice. She meets William Darcy who has come with his friend Bill (Mr Bingley) to an Indian Wedding. There are four sisters in Lalita's family - which is enough - the ""Jane"" for Bingley to fall for, the 'Mary"" to humiliate the family in this case with a very strange cobra dance - and a 'Kitty' to run away with Wickham.

the main plot devices are there - Mr Kohli (Mr Collins) comes back from LA to make a match with one of the Bakshir daughters - and he is every bit the part! The conflict of Mr Darcy with the bumbling stupidity of Mr Kohli and the duplicitous unctiousness of Mr Wickham are there.

Some have minor changes, ""lady Catherine"" is now Catherine, Darcy's mother. Catherine brings Darcy's girlfriend 'Anne' along to the Indian Wedding in the garden in LA mucking up the budding romance between Lalita and Darcy - which is a nice nod to the 'pretty kind of a wilderness' used in the original Pride and Prejudice.

I loved the mixture of Bollywood and its musicals with Austen humour and style - I just about wet my pants in the first few minutes when a hugely noisy singing dancing scene turned up. All the elegance of the nineteenth century is lost in a see of enthusiastic waving, singing and dancing, and it is all done (i am sure with self-deprecating humour! It is not just for those in the know - this is very much laughing at the whole essence of Austen and her interpretations, you can't think of anything more removed from a drawning room of elegant aristocracy than maybe an Indian Wedding.

But there is also other knowing laughs - I really enjoyed the segue to an American Gospel choir on the beach at LA, accompanied by a couple of dancing Baywatchers and a group of surfies complete with boards.

I felt the actors were very well suited to their parts - Lalita is definitely an intelligent and feisty interpretation of Elizabeth - my only minor problem with her is she is altogether too luminously beautiful that she completely outshines the 'Jane' character. Jane is supposed to be the beauty of the family and it is patently not true here. ""Jane"" is certainly beautiful too, and she brings out the sweetness and gentleness of character necessary in the part. I loved Martin Henderson as Darcy, his reserve slowly fading as he gets to know the family better. He is nice looking although I had trouble believing him as a millionaire hotellier - it wasn't out of the realms of possibility.

This is an enormously colourful and good natured interpretation - I loved it!",1129248000,,3103,4.568345323741007
2309677,2,B0009PBLRM,"Overall, this movie tries to provide a decent twist on the Jane Austen novel, from an Indian perspective. That being said, the screenplay, the casting, and the songs/music constitute an Axis of Idiocy that made watching the movie a very painful experience.

The Screenplay: Granted, this belongs to the genre of Bollywood movies that are not necessarily known for their realism. However, even for a Bollywood movie, too much of the portrayal of Indian life and the interaction between the characters were blatantly unrealistic or seemed to be there just for the sake of it. For example - Lalita, who dresses in completely western clothing, whose family can afford to jet-set around the world, goes home on a Ox cart, the supposedly traditional small-town father allows his daughters to go out with a complete stranger, the American suitor (Mr. Kholi) is supposedly very successful in business but has absolutely no social skill whatsoever - and much more. Amritsar, by the way, is not a small town (pop. 1,000,000 which is reasonably large even by Indian standards)

The Casting: Aishwarya Rai has represented India well on the World stage as Miss World and is quite articulate and intelligent. This however is in stark contrast to her chronically deficient acting abilities, as is agonizingly evident in this movie. As for Martin Henderson, this is good enough reason why he is not well known. Only Anupam Kher comes through, fulfilling his role well, as he usually does.

The Songs: This is without a doubt, the most gut-wrenchingly nauseating aspect of the movie. At first I wondered whether these songs were written in Hindi and then translated/dubbed into English. That is exactly what it sounded like. I enjoy Bollywood movies, but in my opinion, some things simply should not be translated. Songs seemed to appear just for the sake of being there. As for the Cobra Dance ...  the less said about that atrocity, the better. This mixture of Disney, Bollywood and the Muppet Show brought more tears to my eyes than Kung Pao: Enter the Fist. If you enjoy Bollywood or Indian cinema, I suggest something like Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge or a Rajnikanth flick.

Gurindher Chadha has definitely done better in the past (Bend it Like Beckham) and hopefully will do better in the future. For movies addressing issues in Contemporary India, I would also suggest watching Monsoon Wedding and City of Joy as they really hit home (from different perspectives).",1129075200,,2455,4.992665036674817
2309678,5,B0009PBLRM,"I loved this movie and am very happy to own it as part of my DVD collection.  The director did a great job of making a Bollywood type movie much more accessible to an international audience.  I like almost everything about this movie, the theme, the setting, the colors, the music, the photography and most of the cast.  It may not have the best acting in the world, but if you accept the movie for what it is, it is well worth two hours of your time.  It is so much more wholesome and fun than most of the movies that are now out there.  I highly recommend it.",1128988800,,561,4.110091743119266
2309679,5,B0009PBLRM,"I was 47 years old when I saw this director's Bend it Like Beckham. Although the storyline was for a younger person, I loved the movie. It was fun, it had great music, and it gave me a good view into the lives of a middle-class Indian family living in England.

Last night, I watched Bride and Prejudice -- I actually watched it twice. For me, Bride and Prejudice left Beckham in the dust. I thought it was a very intellegent adaptation of Austin's Pride and Prejudice to contemporary times. When the first big musical number came in the movie, I was a little thrown that the Pride and Prejudice story, although updated, was going to be a musical. But I love contemporary Indian music, and I immediately found myself waiting for the next musical number. I was surprised that I even enjoyed the musical numbers in Bride and Prejudice more than those in Monsoon Weddng.

Bride and Prejudice simulatenously delt with the serious subject of the negative Anglo viewpoints on modern day India and offered moments of very funny but subtle humor. The cast was excellent. Throughout the movie, my interests never waned. Very few movies entertain me as well as this one did. Although I rarely purchase movies on DVD, I will be purchasing this one.",1128729600,,1237,4.669724770642202

2309681,5,B0009PBLRM,This quickly became one of my favorite movies.  It's a quirky musical with likeable characters.  Even the braying cousin wasn't unlikeable. It's rare I want to see a movie more than once but this one is it.,1127779200,,206,4.54054054054054
2309682,5,B0009PBLRM,"I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this film at first.  Both the title and the DVD box image are rather cheesy - but then I saw the trailer, and it convinced me that this would indeed be something worth watching.  Thank goodness for that trailer because I absolutely adored this movie.  Bride and Prejudice introduced me to a whole new world of cinematic magic.  It's an explosion of vibrant colors, exotic settings, incredible music and dancing, and genuine pleasure.  The story itself, combining romance, drama, as well as comedy, was also a treat in its own right.  If you haven't guessed by the title, this film was inspired by Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice - and I hope Austen enthusiasts will give this film a try, despite whatever misgivings they must surely have about it.  I prefer to judge the film on its own merits, and I can't find anything not to like here.  It's just exquisite.

The film is primarily set in India.  Will Darcy (Martin Henderson) has come with his friend Balraj (Lost's Naveen Andrews) to attend a wedding - and what a wedding it is.  The whole town is in full celebration mode, and the song and dance numbers that come spinning at you in kaleidoscope fashion entrance you with their beauty and grace.  Darcy is immediately taken with a gorgeous young lady named Lalita Bakshi (Aishwarya Rai), who just happens to be the sister of Balraj's object of affection.  She comes from a family full of girls and a mother working tirelessly to find husbands for her older daughters - hopefully rich ones.  Darcy and Lalita, despite a lot of meaningful eye contact, don't exactly hit it off, but that's largely Darcy's fault.  Henderson really isn't very charismatic in the role, and he's not all that eloquent either.  Lalita finds him to be a rude, arrogant American who looks down on her and everyone else in India.  Darcy's also a bit of a wimp, seemingly incapable of standing up to his domineering mother's influence.  She would never approve of an India-born daughter-in-law, of course - but Mrs. Bakshi wouldn't necessarily leap for joy at an American son-in-law, either (no matter how rich he is - and Darcy is filthy rich).  Darcy does get to spend a little time with Lalita (but not because she wants to), but then an acquaintance of his shows up in the form of Johnny Wickham (Daniel Gillies) - why the son of Darcy's nanny suddenly shows up there in India is a complete mystery to me, though.  Wickham's no good, but the ever-ineffectual Darcy won't tell Lalita why.  As for Lalita, she has to fend off a new suitor in the form of an incredibly annoying fellow who has come back from America seeking a bride.  It looks like Darcy and Lalita just weren't meant to be, as he returns to London and Lalita finds herself having to fend off a new suitor in the form of an incredibly annoying fellow who has come back from America seeking a bride.  The world's a small place, though, and fate brings Darcy and Lalita together again in Los Angeles (where the Bakshi family has come to attend another wedding).

The romance is quite predictable, but it does take interesting twists and turns along the way.  I found it pretty compelling, but in many ways the love story is just the excuse to put on an awe-inspiring spectacle of music, dance, and incredible entertainment.  I can't adequately describe the lavish nature of this film, except to say that it is a visual and auditory treat.  I haven't had this much fun watching a film in a long time.  Singing and dancing can start at the drop of a hat, and as often as not it doesn't end until the entire village has joined the fun.  Lalita and her sisters are just wonderful, adorable characters (even the one who does the rather unforgettable Cobra Dance) - and Aishwarya Rai, the true star of this film, shines like the heavens on a dark night. I'll eagerly watch any movie she appears in.  You won't have to worry about nodding off in the middle of this one - as Bride and Prejudice has the contagious energy to revive even the weariest of souls.  Hollywood just doesn't make films like this; until you see this Bride and Prejudice, you probably won't even know what you're missing.",1127606400,,4162,4.591339648173207
2309683,5,B0009PBLRM,"This film is delightful.  I saw it in the theater when it came out and was prompted to go out and buy Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (which I had never read).  The movie is a great adaptation of the book, modernized, and set in India and Los Angeles.  Terrific Bollywood devices--I wish dancing, singing men would pop out when I walk through marketplaces!",1127433600,,358,4.5625
2309684,4,B0009PBLRM,"Much to the utter confusion of my parents, I have been in love with Bollywood and bhangra for years. Bollywood is India's massive film industry based in Bombay (now Mumbai), which produces more films annually than Hollywood. Bollywood films are formulaic, musical tales that combine a number of genres: action, musicals, romances, and tragedy. There are always hundreds of extras that break into song and dance at the drop of a turban. With Bollywood, suspension of disbelief is required.

Gurinder Chadha, mastermind behind the immensely popular ""Bend It Like Beckham"" (2002), returns at the helm of this Bollywood retelling of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, adapting the novel to modern rural India and the Bakshi family, who owns a small farm in Amritsar. The four unmarried daughters (Jaya, Maya, Lakhi, and Lalita) are a source of constant fretting for their mother, who hopes to marry them off for their dowries. The dashingly handsome Londonite Balraj (Naveen Andrews) arrives at a wedding party, along with his American friend Will Darcy, a hotel heir. Jaya is smitten by Balraj, but Will Darcy makes a horrible first impression on Lalita, dismissing Indian culture and arranged marriages, which prompts an impassioned speech by Lalita about subservient, simple women.

For most of the film, the two grate on each other's nerves whenever they meet. Lalita's mother tries to get her to marry the green-card holder Kholi, an obnoxious, chauvinist, hip-hop wannabe who spouts phrases like ""Word up!"" and does mock-gang hand symbols, bragging about his million-dollar house in L.A. Lalita refuses, and Kholi ends up marrying her best friend. Feeling betrayed, she runs into Johnny Wickham at Goa, and is instantly attracted to him. He warns her about Will Darcy, but Lalita soon finds that appearances can be deceiving.

In typical Bollywood style, the various plots and romances cross in and out and intertwine, sprinkled with several show-stopping numbers (the extended versions, some over ten minutes, are included as bonus features), brilliantly colorful costumes, and exotic tastes of India throughout: crowded marketplaces, the Golden Temple of Amritsar used as a backdrop, wedding saris, trays of Indian sweets.

Having a history of Bollywood films, I loved this, but the marriage of Bollywood and Hollywood seemed a bit foreign even to me. Having Indian choruses breaking out in clearly dubbed English instead of Hindi was off-putting. At times, the editing could have benefited from extra cutting, as the film felt overly long, even with the musical numbers scaled down. Western audiences may be turned off by the Bollywood conventions, which are not spelled out or explained, such as Aishwarya Rai not kissing Martin Henderson. In Bollywood, kissing or sexual contact is taboo and is represented by chirping birds, crashing waves, etc., so we never see the two kiss on-screen.

Aishwarya Rai is Bollywood's biggest star. She gained 20 pounds for the role so as not to appear model-thin; she wanted to be seen as ""normal."" This is her first film entirely in English, and she does all of her own singing. Her luminous beauty makes her perfect for the role.

The music is also available as a soundtrack, both in an English version and a Hindi version. Ashanti has a cameo in the film as a tribute to the Bollywood convention of having a famous singer sing a song on-screen that has nothing to do with the movie's plot. Her number is sizzling, and was shot live after she was flown in to Goa for the shoot.

The DVD contains numerous extras, including a director's commentary, extended songs, Ashanti's music video, interviews with Aishwarya Rai and Martin Henderson (Johnny Depp and Joaquin Phoenix were both considered for the role of Mr. Darcy - I would have loved to see Johnny Depp, personally!), a making-of, and more.

Bollywood fans will love this, as will people who enjoy Indian music or who are open-minded about how movies should look or sound. I don't think this is nearly as bad as many fans and critics made it out to be; Gurinder will forever be measured up to ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" which she may never top in popularity or cohesiveness, but ""Bride and Prejudice"" has much to recommend it.",1127347200,,4221,5.028612303290415
2309685,1,B0009PBLRM,"Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai.  Say that ten times fast.  Now, imagine you're great musical composers looking down from heaven.  You don't know any?  Okay, imagine Rogers and Hammerstein who wrote the scores for several musicals like The Sound of Music, The King and I, and Flower Drum Song.  No?  Then try Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe who contributed to My Fair Lady and Gigi.  On top of that let's throw in Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim of West Side Story and Into the Woods fame.  Then let's throw in Jane Austen, who did absolutely nothing to deserve the desecration and vandalism committed to her fine novel.

This was so unspeakably awful that I took it out after trying to sit through it for more than 20 minutes.  I can usually sit through the worst movies until they're over, but this has the dubious distinction of being the second one I ejected from my  DVD player since Deputy Dooright after less than one hour.  I'm so glad to know India was so aptly portrayed with groups of villagers clumped together in lavender, turquoise, and tangerine as they sang and danced some bland and forgettable hiphop pop that often sounded perilously close to ""Macarena.""  ""No Life  Without Wife?""  UGH!  This movie is so shallow and grandiose in its self-importance that a 10 month-old baby could wander in without supervision and never come close to drowning.  This movie is so horrible that I actually believe I have never seen a worse musical, and I have been complaining about Moulin Rouge  since I saw it in the theater!  Wow...I mean WOW!  It's even worse than Frampton and the BOO-Gees in Sgt. Pepper.  Send me hate mail or give me neggies.  I don't care.

This movie was shown in the U.S. and my wife and I saw it during its short run.  We enjoyed it and I bought it for my wife when it came out on DVD.  (I never watch a movie twice, but I made an exception for this movie).

My wife and I enjoyed watching the movie again because of our personal interest in India and its culture.

It is a good movie and has a good story line, but it isn't a great movie. That's why it had a short run in the U.S.  I did read that it is a ""cult"" movie with some U.S. fans, but I don't know about that.

I've watched the movie daily since I got it.  You really should watch it w/ the director's commentary to get a true appreciation of what she's trying to do both from American film and Bollywood film perspectives.  You find out, for example that she did in fact use a true Indian wedding song at one point sung by a henna painter.  I could go on and on.

I think I can safely say after viewing this wonderful movie that as we speak there is probably a bidding war in Hollywood going on to get Aishwarya Rai to sign a 3 picture deal. In short.....she sings, dances, and acts up a storm and if that weren't enough she is strikingly.....I SAID STRIKINGLY.....beautiful beyond words. Maybe the most beautiful woman in movies today! The movie starts off very (maybe too) Indian with some ensemble dance numbers that go waaaaaaaay tooooooo loooooooong! BUT!!!

Aishwarya Rai is an actress that is totally overrated and cannot act and casting her in the main role was what spoilt the film.

Namrata Shirodkar was more beautiful and acted better.

2309693,4,B0009PBLRM,"I can hardly express how much I enjoyed this movie--but I shall try. From the first wedding song to the last, B&P is at once exuberant, ironic, observant, and hilarious. The songs are fun, the dancing lively and energetic. And I thought Mrs. Bakshi's (Bennet's) obsession to marry off her daughters translated very well into this modern-day Bollywoodization of my favorite book ever.

Ms. Rai, as Lalitha, is stunning, sharp, graceful, and --though not the best actress in the world--is capable of carrying the movie all by herself. Fortunately, she does not have to, as most of the supporting cast is superior. Mr. Bakshi is perfect as the sardonic, wife-weary Mr. Bennet character--and Nadira Babbar is suitably vulgar and embarrassing as the wearying wife. Jaya and Bingley are precisely as they should be, beautiful and bland. But it's the truly peripheral characters that steal this show. I particularly love Mr. Kholi (Collins) and his nouveau-American zeal (I sooo know guys like that!). And Maya's (Mary's) serpent dance had me ROTFLMAO!

Sure, the movie had flaws. I found Darcy to be a rather obscure character (but to be fair, Mr. Darcy doesn't appear much in the original novel either). The Wickham story, though necessary, was a bit hurried and unconvincing--and still I felt he spent far too much time with Lalitha. Yes, I know it's a contradiction, but that's how I felt.

But who cares about that! By the end of this movie, I felt as bouyant and happy as I do when I watch one of those old-timey, feel-good musicals, like _Singin' in the Rain_ or _Gigi_. You probably have to be in the right mood to enjoy this movie properly, but I'm willing to bet that the movie itself will put you in just such a mood.

As the ""old saying"" goes: ""I loved it. It was much better than Cats. I want to see it again and again."" I'll be buying B&P soon to add to my library, along with _Clueless_ and _Bridge Jones's Diary_, of fabulous Jane Austen-inspired films.",1126224000,,1962,4.728070175438597
2309694,5,B0009PBLRM,"We really liked this one. I am a devotee of Jane Austen and have seen quite a few of the dramatizations of her books. Most of these are poor because for various reasons the books are misinterpreted. The recent rendition of Pride and Predjudice produced by A&E was an atrocity. Bride and Predjudice by trying to be less than a literal translation found the essence of the story and displayed it well. The drama of the movie is well paced and believable. I am not usually a fan of musicals but I liked several of the songs. The artistic arrangements of the dance numbers were colorful and very well designed. The only negative critisism I might have is that if you are hard of hearing the Indian accents will make the story occasionally hard to follow, especially if you are unfamiliar with the basic story. Which leads me to my basic problem with all modern movies that is the very wide dynamic range of speech. I like drama, that is why I love movies. But I am hard of hearing and whispers cause me to ramp up the volume which is often followed by some hideously loud noise. I also hate background music that covers the speeches. DVD makers take note why can't we have a sound track available which solves these problems. Bride and Predjudice is pretty good in these areas and my rating is excellent for the overall movie.

Mr. Kholi's character(Mr. Collins' Pride & Prejudice counterpart)is wonderful - just distasteful enough, and the DVD also serves as a mini travel video visiting two parts of India, London, and LA.

The only weakness was Will Darcy's voice. Every time the actor spoke I thought of Owen Wilson at his whinniest - not the cultured tones we would expect from mega-millionare Mr. Darcy.

2309700,4,B0009PBLRM,"While perhaps not as good as the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, Bride and Prejudice is a worthwhile movie to spend a few hours watching. The costumes and beautiful women plus the lively dancing is worth the couple of hours of viewing.

The story of four Indian daughters and a mother seeking husbands for them is played out against the arrival in their town of a wealthy India now living in England and a wealthy American hotel owner.  Almost at once the oldest daughter and the American find themselves raging about almost everything. And when an English acquaintance of the American arrives in India and the oldest daughter si drawn to him, the American must decided if she is the one despite their differences.

One of the most interesting characters in the movie is the Indian who now lives near ""North California, not 90210 Beverly Hills when the the mother asks him where he lives in California, and who is looking for an Indian wife to bring back with him. He is a funny and sad character as he tries to imrpress everyone with his green card. It is here that the director and screen writer allow the audience to reflect on the difference between those that have left India seeking fame and riches in England or the United States and those who have remained behind.

In the last number of years I have been throughly intrigued by movies made in India.  Along with films such as Monsoon Wedding, The Masseur, Bend it Like Beckham and the Broadway show Bombay Dreams, Bride and Prejduice is a movie that I highly recommend to viewers.

I liked the idea of the story being set in India, but I didn't think it worked.  The actors were very good, and generally appealing, the setting was gorgeous, the costumes were lovely, but it failed to satisfy me, and it just didn't work.  The adaptation was a little too modern, and it was choppy at best.  In part it dragged for too much of the film, and then at the end, it galloped relentlessly towards it's conclusion.  I wanted very much to like this, but I just couldn't do it. Maybe I was spoiled by the BBC's excellent adaptation with Colin Firth.  In that version, he was a wonderful foil to Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth.  They were worthy opponents.  In this version, the Darcy character is sacrificed, as indeed, are almost all of the characters, to give the Lalita character more of a pop. They all end up toothless and colorless by comparison; a bland mishmosh of characters in a murkey celluloid hell, while she comes off as more petulant and ill-mannered than he does.  He is merely inoffensive and awkward, but she is often bitchy, because she can be.",1125532800,,1210,4.539170506912442

2309703,4,B0009PBLRM,"As I am a huge Jane Austen and a devoted Pride & Prejudice fan, I decided earlier to collect the different film versions connected to JA and P&P.
I did not expected much from this film (having the modern, 2003 P&P in mind which was very low-key I think), thought it would be a tolerable, fun-for-1-hour-and-a-half film, but it exceeded my expectations. I found it funny, well directed and highly enjoyable.

The characters were well chosen,you could believe they are real flesh&blood persons, not just some flat charactertypes. I loved both Lalita and Darcy. When I first saw Martin Henderson on the cover photo, I thought him too handsome, too light (Mr D is supposed to be dark & brooding - think about Colin Firth or L. Olvier, both fantastic!) too American if you like - sorry US, no offence meant! - and I doubted whether he could act as it can be expected from a proper Darcy-character. Fortunately he proved me wrong. You could see why Lalita found him irritating, but you could feel attracted to him at the same time.

Mr & Mrs Bakshi were very funny. Mr Bakshi was a gentle, placid person unlike Mr Bennet, but his quiet, yet sharp humour was very appealing. Mrs Bakshi was satisfyingly amusing and embarrassing at the same time. Mr Kohli was hilarious, Jhaya very lovely, Balraj kind and funny.

I liked the colours and the action. The dances were superb, some songs were very good, others not so much (this is why I don't give 5 stars) and it is a great pity that the song Arrogance, Pride & Vanity was omitted: it could have thrown more light on the contradictory relationship between Lalita & Darcy and emphasized more the already existing chemistry between them.
It is very positive that it was included in special features however. Some of the omitted scenes were also very entertaining.

And you know what? I dare to risk the personal opinion that Miss Jane A might have enjoyed this film herself!",1125014400,,1913,4.650887573964497
2309704,3,B0009PBLRM,"I like the concept of a Bollywoodized version of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" - the high energy and flashy colors of the Mumbai-based film industry seem ripe for cross-cultural exposure. However, somewhere between concept and execution, director Gurinder Chadha misses the mark in adapting the particular stylizations of Indian cinema into something that really could resonate with a worldwide audience. Chadha presumes the viewer knows about the polarizing characteristics of Bollywood cinema, which I think is her most fundamental mistake here.

This 2004 film indiscriminately bounces between a social comedy about class differences among native and British-born Indians, a veiled indictment against American imperialism, and a carefree dinner theater-type musical with people spontaneously breaking out into often clumsy choreography. If anything, Chadha and screenwriter Paul Mayeda Berges stick too closely to the plot contrivances of Austen's 1813 novel instead of focusing on the themes that elevated the book into a literary classic, and the problem is compounded by poor editing where turns in the story feel like they happen in a vacuum.

Even when Chadha tries mightily to capture the vibrancy of multi-culturalism, especially in playing cross-cultural clashes for laughs through character stereotypes and slapstick situations, the movie falls short in the handling of key themes such as racial identity and cultural fidelity. That's a shame because she has certainly assembled an attractive cast to inhabit the story starting with one of Bollywood's biggest stars, the inarguably stunning Aishwarya Rai, as the feisty Elizabeth Bennett character, Lalita, who will not succumb to an arranged marriage at the expense of real love. In her English-language movie debut, she is a charismatic presence and plays her role with feisty charm.

The same cannot be said of Martin Henderson, so blandly wooden as William Darcy, the priggish American son of a hotel magnate, that it's often hard to tell that he is enamored with Lalita. He is sadly overshadowed by Daniel Gilles as Darcy's nemesis, Johnny Wickham, a Brit of dubious character, and Naveen Andrews as Darcy's British-Indian friend Balraj Bingley (who even gets to break out into a production number that recalls ""America"" from ""West Side Story""). Both are more interesting actors and inadvertently offset the romantic balance of the film.

With the exceptions of the wonderful Anupam Kher as the patient Mr. Bakshi and the pretty Namrata Shirodkar as Lalita's more marriage-minded sister Jaya, the rest of the supporting cast is painted in fairly broad brushstrokes - Indira Varma as Balraj's haughty sister, Kiran; Nadira Babbar as the mother overly obsessed with marrying off her daughters; Nitrin Ganatra as the obnoxious Mr. Kholi (a buffoonish cross between Jerry Lewis and Urkel); and in a thankless cameo, an aged Marsha Mason plays Darcy's controlling mother as an upscale harridan.

As with many Bollywood films, the film travels quite a bit in lightning flashes - from the Punjabi city of Amritsar to the beach resort town of Goa to London to LA and back. You would think the songs (written by Craig Pruess and Anu Malik) would provide the high points, but the music and lyrics are pretty pedestrian considering the obvious expense of the film itself. Choreographed by Bollywood stalwart Saroj Khan, the production numbers are elaborate, sometimes a great deal of fun with some thoroughly ridiculous, out-of-the-blue elements such as a gospel choir on Santa Monica Beach and R&B singer Ashanti showing up at a beach rave party in Goa.

If you've never experienced a Bollywood movie, I'm not sure this film would motivate you to try a real one, but if you want a more fulfilling view of India, you may want to reach back for Jean Renoir's ""The River"" or Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy. There are a surprising number of extras with the DVD, but they are variable in quality. Chadha and Berges provide the less-than-revelatory audio commentary on an alternate audio track. There are deleted scenes and extended production numbers, interviews with Rai and Henderson, a making-of featurette, a throwaway extra called ""The Crew Does the Songs"", and even an Ashanti video of her performance.",1124582400,,4262,5.278761061946903

Our favorites were the wedding song and the shopping trip in the market, which ends in a Busby Berkely style overhead shot with color-coordinated turbans swirling in patterns.

2309709,5,B0009PBLRM,"Bride and Prejudice resets Jane Austen's story in modern day rural India.  Lalita lives with her parents and three sisters in India.  She helps her father run the family rice farm and has a head for business.  Her mother is obsessed with finding them husbands (arranged marriages are the norm) and her sisters are loveable airheads to varying degrees.  As elidgable men visit their town, the sisters develop crushes and do the typical female spying and giggling.  The mother tries to set them up with anyone with money.  Finding a good husband is a very crucial step in these girls lives in a way that wouldn't make sense if they were living down the street in Florida.  At the same time they are very normal and easy to relate to.  They cue into pop culture.

This film showed family so accurately.  Scenes of the mother trying to tone down the youngest sister who wants to show more skin, while at the same time the mother is trying to get her two older daughters to show more skin and attract husbands, ring true.  The sisters gossiping about men are great.  They giggle about the way too eager visitor from the US who has returned to India specifically for a wife.  They describe their crushes to one another and make their own match making plans.  The mom here is more positively portrayed that in the other adaptation I have seen (the british mini series).  She is, as required, a bit ditzy and obsessed with setting her daughters up.  Despite driving her husband crazy throughout the film, at the end they do a musical number together on the stairs.  Its not what they are singing about, but you know that they really do love one another.

By the way this is a musical.  The songs do fit in with the plot, but at the same time they are randomly breaking into an extremely colorful song and dance number.  These musical bits were well done.  They aren't about choreographed dance (although that does happen).  Rather they show us more details in the scene, provide comic relief or advance the plot a bit (we see that Lalita has fallen in love in the last bars of a musical sequence).  The point is, they are mixed in well and not disconcerting.

I usually can't get into Jane Austen novels or adaptations, and I loved this.  This is a good choice of musical or a movie for a girls night.  I would watch this again and again, and I don't watch movies again.  If this at all sounds like something that you would like then it is unlikely to let you down.",1123977600,,2457,4.462921348314607

2309714,4,B0009PBLRM,"Bolly & Holly woods meet.  By now, everyone knows of Hollywood's attempt to bring ""the most beautiful woman in the world"" to the West, but Aishwarya Rai (who really is breathtaking) doesn't seem phased by the move.  As Lalitha she sings, dances, pouts, spouts wisdom and contempt for Western ways and pretty much owns the movie.  But she is helped out, wildly, by a cast of Indian, British and American actors bent on making her have a good time as well as having this slightly contrived amalgamation of Jane Austen work.  And boy do they succeed!

There are moments of absolute joy on screen and its hard not to get caught up in them.  There are also moments of genuine hilarity.  One of the highlights is Lalitha's little sister's ""Cobra Dance"" to entertain their house guests.  Hot and hilarious all at once.

Deep?  Not really, but its universal message of prejudice, tolerance, racial profiling and stereotypes is presented in about as palatable a plate of curry as you can possibly imagine.

2309716,5,B0009PBLRM,"I think that for many Westerners, Indian movies are harder to watch than other foreign films because Indian song and dance are almost obligatory but not to the taste of the majority of Americans -- it's not music we're used to, and we're not used to movies with countless song-and-dance scenes.

The director (as you learn from the special features section) went to great lengths to try to make the music more accessible to Americans but still Indian.  I think it worked.  It took some getting used to, but by the ""No Life No Wife"" number, I was enjoying the music and amused by the campy song and dance number (four Indian girls in pajamas having fun teasing each other about the ""Mr. Collins"" character).

I thought the movie actually kept quite close to the plot of the original book, including retaining some of the most memorable lines.  For those who haven't read Pride and Prejudice, the plot involves a mother trying to get her four daughters married off in a good marriage -- to someone with money and status.  She's silly and rather common (as the Brits say) and the father is kind but too little involved.  The oldest daughter falls in love with a visiting man (an Indian living in England) and the second daughter has a love-hate relationship with a rich American.  One of the younger daughters is boy-crazy and the fourth insists upon displaying her questionable talents to visitors, to the embarrassment of her family.  There is an Indian from America who has come back to India looking for a wife, and although the mother is anxious to marry one of her daughters off to him, they are all revolted by him.  He's a very funny character, every bit as awful as the Mr. Collins of Jane Austen's book, but a parody of Indians who go to America to make their fortune (he has a 5 bedroom house in California and all he lacks is a wife.)

It took 15 minutes or so for this movie to grow on me, but after that, I enjoyed it.  Is it Hollywood?  Of course not.  It's not really Bollywood either.  But it's humorous, moves right along in plot, and visually attractive (watch the use of color in the costumes).  And it's campy.",1123459200,,2128,4.516971279373368

2309721,3,B0009PBLRM,"When I heard that the beautiful, talented, memerizing Aishwarya Rai, one of the most famous Bollywood stars, was to star in a cross-over film, targetted at launching her career overseas, I was so excited!  For those of you not familiar with Ms. Rai, she has starred in many, many Bollywood films (the Indian equivelant of our Hollywood films in this country), is not only a wonderful actress, whose performances really touch your soul with her tenderness and intensity, but is also a beautiful dancer and a fine ambassador for her country, and a former Miss Universe.  It really sounds like the whole package, doesn't it?

""Bride and Prejudice"" is a modern, East-meets-West interpretation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice,"" with a Bollywood spin on it, of course.  This means romantic scenes and high drama, intermixed with flashy, energetic dance numbers, along with dance numbers.  Lalita (Aishwarya Rai) is a beautiful, intelligent and highly opinionated Indian woman who encounter Will Darcy (Martin Henderson) during a wedding, and sparks fly. Will is an American, who comes from a family whose business is rooted in the hotel industry, and has intentions of starting a new hotel in Lalita's town.  This leads to a lot of heated conversations, and Lalita's frustrations surface regarding the exploitation of her people's ""exoticism"" in the eyes of Western culture.

What could have been interesting and intelligent really came off as preachy to me.  Rai, who usually plays intelligent, opinionated characters in her Bollywood films, in India, comes off as shrill and even bratty in this story!  The air of political-correctness truly took the joy out of the movie for me.  Also, even though Gurinder Chadha, the director, had great intentions and tried to intermix humor, romance and music into the story, to give us, the Western audience, a little sense of the diverse flavors of Bollywood, I really felt she tried too hard to be everything to everybody.

Nevertheless, you have to hand it to Rai for attempting to reach her potential American fanbase.  My reccomendation to you is that skip this film and watch either ""I Have Found It"" or ""Straight From the Heart (Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam).""  These are two beautiful examples of Aishwarya Rai's depth and soulfulness as an actress.",1123027200,,2292,5.0638297872340425
2309722,5,B0009PBLRM,"I wanted to see this film because I'm a big fan of the TV adaptations of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (and have read Austen's book many times). So I will try to review this movie from the perspective of a big P&P/Austen fan.

First of all, if you are watching this film as someone who is very familiar with Pride and Prejudice, prepare yourself for some changes. It captures the essence of the story, but things are shifted around, shortened, condensed, and so forth. However, rest assured that the main characters all are there, and the general plot points (the ones that make Pride and Prejudice what it is) are all there.

""Lizzie"" is now Lalitha, played by the incredibly lovely and charming Aishwarya Rai, who is a number 1 movie star in India (and you can see why).

Martin Henderson plays ""Will Darcy,"" and while he's very attractive, he lacks a certain charisma at the beginning (but hey! We're supposed to dislike Darcy!). However, he does a servicable job and at the end of the film you really warm up to him.

Naveen Andrews plays Balraj Bingley (aka ""Mr. Bingley"") and to me, he steals the show when he's onscreen. He has a whole lot of pizazz (especially in a great dance sequence early in the film).

Marsha Mason plays Darcy's mom, (she substitutes for the role of ""Lady Catherine DeBurgh""). Her role is not as prominent in this movie as in the novel (or in the TV productions of P&P), however, look for a deleted scene on the DVD to see a key P&P scene between her and Lalitha (""Lizzy"").

Mr. Wickham is here, as is one Miss Bingley (who doesn't seem quite as venomous as the two Bingley sisters in the book).

There are now 4 ""Bennet"" (now Bakshi) sisters in this version--it appears like the character of Kitty has been elemintated.

Mr. and Mrs. Bakshi (""Bennet"") are *great* in this version, though their characters are not as clearly defined as in the book (the dad is not so much of a bookworm, the mom isn't quite so much of an over-the-top ninny--though she's pretty silly at times).

There's also a ""Mr. Collins"" character, a ""Charlotte Lucas"" character, ""Georgina Darcy"" character, and so forth. Really, they did an amazing job in adapting this story so it resembles the Austen book as much as it does (while still making it work for 21st Century audiences).

The core plot points of the book are all present here, but big changes have been made in the details, in order to make the story work for modern times (and for people from Indian, British and US cultures). You will recognize the plot points, but sometimes the motivations or outcomes are somewhat different.

There are several big musical (singing and dancing) sequences in the movie. As I found out from one of films presented in the DVD extras, this is an essential part of ""Bollywood"" films, and this movie was meant to appeal to both Western and Indian audiences. The songs were written by Indian composers, who crafted them to also be appealing to Western audiences. They did a fantastic job. The songs do eat up some screen time, but they are charming, fun, full of color and energy, and I decided that I liked them. A lot. Also, a seemingly unecessary dance number (Ashanti does a seductive dance and song in the middle of the movie) also is part of many Bollywood films (as the director explains in the DVD extras). Apparently, Indian filmgoers expect a big number such as this in the middle of such films.

If you are a big Pride and Prejudice fan you should see this movie, but prepare yourself for what it is and isn't. It's faithful to the book--up to a point, but by no means is it even remotely meant to follow it in any great detail. Characters and situations are altered or tweaked, but they're all (mostly) there. ""Mr. Collins"" (now called Mr. Kholi) does what he does. There's the big ""rejection scene"" (if you know the book or TV miniseries, you know what I mean). The ""Darcy comes to the rescue"" scene is present, but decidedly altered. And so forth and so on. If you know this about the movie going in and can accept this, you won't be disappointed at all.

Another interesting detail: apparently lead actress Rai (who plays Lalitha) will not kiss her leading men onscreen (due to cultural issues in India, it would be the ""kiss of death"" to her career to kiss onscreen). The lack of kissing in this movie doesn't really matter all that much (the characters are able to show tenderness and affection well enough without it), but the reasons why there isn't any smooching are pretty interesting.",1122854400,,4494,4.58852867830424
2309723,4,B0009PBLRM,"Bride & Prejudice is loosely based on Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice. Knowing that fact it only takes the basic element of the book and creates and very engaging movie. Don't look for the witty dialogue from the book or the A&E Production. This move takes Indian culture as well as Indian movie making and makes a pleasing transformation into mainstream Hollywood.

The First standout is Aishwarya Rai, who is perhaps the most beautiful woman in movies today. Don't let that fact fool you, she is very talented and is an excellent English actress. I can see why she is so popular in India. She is captivating.

The only two negatives I have with this movie is the R&B ""singer"" Ashanti. She is so out of her element. Though she is only there for a few minutes, it's distracting and obvious ploy to get American audiences interested.

The other is story related, since there is no Lady Catherine DeBurg, Mr. Darcy's mother assumes that role. The tension between

her and Lalitha (Elizabeth) is there but I think the movie could have been taken to another level if there was a confrontation between the two. So for that reason I deduct a star.

So if you go in with the expectation that this does not follow the original Pride & Prejudice to the letter, you will be pleasantly surprised. While you're watching you can't help yourself but recall the book and A&E movie, but I don't think it hurts ""Bride.""

Of course, the A&E production of Pride & Prejudice is highly recommended, but consider ""Bride & Prejudice"" as Jane Austen light.",1122854400,,1532,4.655555555555556

This 2005 film is based on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice novel from 1813, which was made into movies a number of times. It was a BBC production in 1996, starring Colin Firth and then remade again, starring Firth, as Bridget Jone's Diary. Firth played the Darcy character in both films. The Jones film is based on a novel by Helen Fielding, and her book was a retelling of the Austen story.

Directed by Gurinder Chadha who directed Bend It Like Beckam, Bride is a very funny, and lavishly photographed. India has it's beautiful, modern places and they are on full display. Witness the beach scenes at night with the rave starring singer Ashanti. The characters are mostly extraordinarily attractive, thanks especially to former Miss World 1994 Aishwarya Rai, and her on-screen sisters. Martin Henderson plays the brooding Darcy, someone who was immediately smitten but not comfortable showing it. Rai's Lalita (Austen's Elizabeth Bennet character) is whip smart, opinionated and won't marry for money over love.

Essentially, the Bakshi family, farmers, have four daughters, with two being pushed into marriage by the matchmaker mother. When rich family friends come to visit for a wedding, the mother encourages the attraction between a couple of them and the two oldest daughters. One hooks up with Lalita's older sister, played by he stunning Namatra Shirodokar, a former Miss Universe runner-up. His friend, Will Darcy, whose family own luxury hotels, is into Lalita, but so is the nerdy rich one from L.A., Mr. Kholi and Darcy's nemesis, the charming cad Johnny Wickham. Seeing all the beautiful people in this film can make you a believer in love at first sight.

Most of the dance numbers are typical Bollywood save for the one in which Lilita's sisters tease her about how the rich nerd ""no life without wife."" It's meant to recall the movie Grease and is a refreshing change of pace. All the songs were written by Indian songwriters with the goal of appealing to Western ears. Mission accomplished.

Lalita appears too eager to dismiss Darcy. He's nuts about her but at the same time, she can't stand him. The film would have had more heart, too, if they removed some of the flash to focus more on the characters. At times, it's just a tad too much like music video. They also should have kept one of the deleted scenes in which Darcy visits Balraj (Naveen Andrews)to apologize for talking his friend out of marrying Lalita's older sister, due to the gold-digging attitude of the mother. Lalita's friendship with Johnny Wickham also appears to develop too quickly.

Compared to the Austen films that came out about 10 years ago, Emma (with Gwen Paltrow) and Sense and Sensebility (Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant), Bride and Prejudice comes close but isn't quite in the same company.",1122768000,,2795,4.923566878980892
2309725,2,B0009PBLRM,"There are some really great, memorable song/dance numbers in this movie but, ultimately, it fails as a worthy adaption of its mentor: Jane Austen's novel, Pride And Prejudice. The premise is great- instead of a class struggle, the tension between Elizabeth and Darcy is now due to cultural misunderstandings/barriers. Unfortunately, the character of Elizabeth Bennet comes across as someone who is out to completely- and, perhaps, intentionally?  -misinterpret everything that Darcy says. It is difficult, therefore, to understand his attraction. Their exchanges create the impression that she is being almost absurdly judgemental and close minded toward him.  Perhaps such harshness on her part could be excused if Darcy himself were played with having more prejudice. In this adaptation, however, Darcy comes across as being an overall ""nice guy"". His greatest flaw does not seem to stem from his pride but from the fact that he is besotted with someone who is apparently obsessed with misconstrueing everything that he says or does. Needless to say, it is not a match made among equals. The viewer, as a result, is given the feeling that ""pride and prejudice"" is not the real problem with these two getting together so much as it is a case of poorly scripted dialogue. As a result, the relationship between the two characters is not as convincing as it should be. I definately see some serious marriage counselling in their so-called ""happpily-ever-after"" future.
Bottom line: I really did want to like this movie- and, despite its cheesiness, it does work on some levels. But not enough to keep this viewer from feeling a keen sense of dissapointment at the shabby rendition of two such beloved characters.",1122595200,,1710,5.14748201438849
2309726,4,B0009PBLRM,"After reading mainstream reviewers, I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie. I was pleasantly surprised, this movie was funny, had a nice story and had some great actors.

Most of the characters had a lot of depth and I also liked the diversity of the different types of actors. The way the director used colorful sets and outfits is really nice.  There are some really funny parts - like the cobra dance.  The only thing I didn't like was some of the songs. I liked two of the songs, but the other ones were annoying.

Over all, this was a great, light-hearted movie, perfect to watch with the family.",1122595200,,605,4.423423423423423
2309727,5,B0009PBLRM,"I loved this movie! It's been a long time since I've been able to just sit back and really enjoy a good old fashioned romantic comedy. Most romantic comedies lately are so stale and corny and predictable(ie-anything with Ashton Kutcher). But this one just hits it out of the ballpark.

Aishwarya Rai is ridiculously beautiful and mesmerizing onscreen, her charming lead Martin Henderson was equal parts handsome and (eventually) dreamy, and the supporting actors were hilarious!

Mr. Kholi and Rai's little sister trying to ""exhibit"" by doing a cobra dance is worth the price of the DVD alone!

The music was great, the dance sequences were entertaining(I want a sari now!), and there's the all-important grand romantic gesture by Henderson's character to illustrate how much he cherishes the object of his affection. Don't waste any time and buy this-my husband hates romantic comedies by nature, and even his macho self thought this was a great movie!",1121817600,,953,5.096153846153846
2309728,4,B0009PBLRM,"What's not to like?

I've never read any Jane Austen, and only know her work from the film adaptations.  SENSE & SENSIBILITY, EMMA, etc.  So I cannot comment if ""BRIDE"" AND PREJUDICE does a good job of translating Austen to Bollywood.  I suspect it does a fine job of translating the ""spirit"" of her work however.  It's a movie where misunderstandings and hurt feelings are unravelled, and love triumphs over all.  The kind of movie where even the ""villains"" end up being likeable.

This movie is a musical, and the musical numbers (which are inspired by the Indian movie musical, or Bollywood) are mostly extremely high energy and well choreographed.  What I like is that the movie obviously understands how ridiculous the idea of two people (or an entire city block) breaking into song and dance can be...yet it does a fabulous job of making that very act a blast!  The beautiful colors that the Indian women wear make every production number a treat...and the music is heavily influenced by Indian music, with a bit of pop beat for us Americans.  Truly, the music makes you want to get up and move around!

They say that in musicals, the reason people burst into song is that their emotions are too strong to be expressed any other way.  Well, this movie shows that the excitement of love and impending marriage just boils up and spills over into song.  My 12 year old daughter, who was VERY skeptical when I brought this movie home, immediately watched it a 2nd time.

The performers all top rate.  Best known to Americans will be Martin Henderson (THE RING, TORQUE) and Naveen Andrews (LOST, THE ENGLISH PATIENT).  But the little known Indian performers, particularly the women, are the true soul of the film.  I don't recall the actresses names, but you I imagine they are stars in their own country, and should be getting more work ""here.""  The characters are tough yet quick to melt.  They are smarter than most of the men.  They have great clothes!

The only reason the movie doesn't get five stars is because it is SO light and frothy.  It's a confection of a movie.  It doesn't make many demands...so it doesn't rise to the level of a ""classic.""  Also, to be a little nitpicky...Martin Henderson isn't fabulous in the part of Darcy.  Granted, his character is supposed to be a bit of a stick-in-the-mud, but he's actually mostly dull at first.  Towards the end, he gets to let his natural charisma go a little and we warm to him.  And as with many foreign accented films, it takes a while to ""tune"" your ear to the goings-on, particularly as the 2nd or 3rd scene in the film is a crowded celebration scene, and the background noise makes it that much harder to follow.

But these minor quibbles aside, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this little gem for lovers of fun and romance and great music!",1121731200,,2802,4.617408906882591
2309729,4,B0009PBLRM,I liked this movie because i like this Director's work. Alos I like Ashwariya Rai Cuz she's The No # 1 Actress in india. The comedy is great. There are some Romantic moments and some drama but in the end its a nice movie to watch and worth buying on dvd.,1121558400,,254,4.0
2309730,3,B0009PBLRM,"Don't let the first ten minutes throw you off.  Keep watching, and the payoff is a pretty cute movie, based on the novel Pride and Prejudice.  And a warning here - this movie is a musical!  Although it doesn't follow the Austen novel exactly, and a lot of nuance is missing, it still gets the gist of it right.  It's fun, it's colorful, and it does give a glimpse of the culture of India.  I watched this with my partner, and he liked it better than I did - but it doesn't hurt that the protagonist is drop-dead gorgeous.",1121472000,,521,4.222222222222222
2309731,4,B0009PBLRM,"There are so many films like BRIDE AND PREJUDICE that a term has been created for them: Bollywood.  The term is not meant to be derogatory but it does designate a certain genre of films from India that harken back to the Hollywood Musicals of the 40s and 50s.  The stories are usually rather like recipes: girls meet boys, tease and flirt and pine away when something evil happens, then everything works out happy-wappy to the tune of a big, loud showstopper musical extravaganza.  The aspect that makes these silly movies watchable is the fact that they are so over the top and colorful and over produced and acted and danced and sung that the viewer can't help but have a good time.

Director Gurinder Chadha has updated Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' with the help of screenwriter Paul Mayeda Berges and the result is a weak facsimile of the novel but a fairly good platform for speaking out against prejudice both in India and outside India (England and the USA).  There is the requisite matchmaker mother (Nadira Babbar) and reticent daughter-loving father (Anupam Kher) and the run of the story concerns finding husbands by arrangement for the daughters.  One of the daughters Lalita (the stunningly beautiful and talented Aishwarya Rai) is wise and advanced in her philosophy, not ready to tolerate the attitudes of English or American men.  The others are ready for marriage and for making exceptions to emotional responses in order to follow the Indian tradition of marrying well.

Enter American millionaire hotelier Darcy (an utterly bland Martin Henderson), an English cad Johnny (Daniel Gillies), an oafish expatriated Indian who has made his fortune in 'Amrika' and comes home to find a bride Mr. Kohli (Nitin Chandra Ganatra), and another Indian of wealth Balraj (Naveen Andrews who sings and dances like a pro).  The misadventures of courting spread from the girl's hometown to Goa to London to Los Angeles and finally all's well that ends well.  Propelling this slight story are songs and dance numbers and a plethora of expensive costumes and sets and elephants and casts of thousands, all seeming like too much of a good thing.

The acting is rudimentary (there really is no apparent need for characterization, even from such pros like Marsha Mason in cameos) but the 'performances' are just great fun.  Take this film for what it is - fizzy, frolicking summer entertainment - and you'll have a good time.  Just don't expect Gurinder Chadra's usual insightful, touching work.

2309732,4,B0009PBLRM,"""Bride and Prejudice"" is a hybrid Hollywood/Bollywood style film from Indian-British director Gurinder Chadha, who made 2002's ""Bend It Like Beckham"". The story adapts Jane Austen's 1813 novel ""Pride and Prejudice"" into an English-language, Bollywood-style musical that takes place in India, London, and Los Angeles. The most extreme Bollywood stylistic devices have been avoided in order not to estrange Western audiences. But the film maintains an extroverted, expressive acting style, and the requisite 6 or 7 musical numbers traditional to Bollywood film, including an ""item number"", in which pop star Ashanti puts on a show. Stunning Indian film star Aishwarya Rai plays the lead role and steals the show, as she must.

In the town of Amritsar, India, the Bakshi family has 4 daughters who are as yet unmarried, much to their mother's dismay. Mrs. Bakshi (Nadira Babbar) has high hopes that her eldest daughter Jaya (Namrata Shirodkar) will catch the eye of a wealthy British barrister named Balraj (Naveen Andrews) who has come to town for a friend's wedding. Balraj has brought with him a good friend, Will Darcy (Martin Henderson), an equally eligible American hotelier. Will is taken with the beauty and frankness of the Bakshi's second daughter Lalita (Aishwarya Rai), but manages to always say the wrong thing. Jaya and Balraj get along well...until Balraj seems to get cold feet. A man from Will's past arrives on the scene and begins to ply Lalita with false charm. And the chances for romance begin to look slim.

Basic storyline and characters from the 19th century. Innocence, corniness and colors from Bollywood. Three continents. India's biggest movie star doing a film in English. The obvious question is: Mess or success? Well, the dialogue could be better. Most of the musical numbers are in English, and some of the songs aren't very good. Martin Henderson plays Darcy too bland to hold his own against Aishwarya Rai. But I think ""Bride and Prejudice"" is a pleasant enough film and an interesting attempt at hybridization. This musical romantic dramedy may especially appeal to pre-teen girls, which is to say that it is a little silly, but fun and entertaining. There is no denying Aishwarya Rai's star power. She is an emotional force even in the face of weak dialogue -the mark of movie star in any culture- and viewers will not be able to take their eyes off of her. I hope to see her in more English language films. She seems a natural for romantic comedy.

The DVD (Disney/Miramax 2005): Bonus features include 6 deleted scenes, 4 extended musical numbers, 4 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In ""Bringing Bombay to L.A.: The Making of Bride and Prejudice"" (11 minutes), director Gurinder Chadha, the cast, and screenwriter talk about adapting Jane Austen's novel and combining different cultural sensibilities and ways of working on the film. In ""Conversation with Aishwarya Rai"" (8 minutes), the actress talks about the film's themes and making the movie. In ""Conversation with Martin Henderson"" (4 1/2 minutes), the actor talks about being in a Bollywood-style film. ""The Crew Does the Songs"" (5 minutes) is a video of the crew spontaneously performing their version of the wedding dance number. The director introduces ""Ashanti's Song"" (3 minutes) with an explanation before we see the performance again. The audio commentary by director Gurinder Chadha and husband screenwriter Paul Mayeda Berges discusses how the film conforms to and departs from Bollywood, how the Hollywood and Bollywood styles interact, adapting the novel, and the challenges of filming.

And I think if you watch the movie realizing people are going to break out in song with the slightest provocation the way Gene Kelly did back in the day, you'll have fun!

It's simply an upbeat, warm hearted movie that wants to entertain. And I think it does in spades-the musical sequences are entertaining, the colors are vibrant, the slapstick humor will make you giggle, and best of all, you get to see two really hot people fall in love! I love the BBC production too, but I don't think that means all future adaptions must come to a halt. I'd think Ms. Austen herself would be flattered that her story has such an intetnational and timeless appeal-it's a celebration of her work, not a trashing.",1121385600,,924,4.566265060240964

If it had been we would be complaining about that. As far as I can see the movie got in the most important parts of the novel and all my favorite.

I really enjoyed how the brilliant work of Jane Austen was updated and put into a vastly different society. It showcases how this novel is not only relevant today, but still entertaining. That is the test of a great story after all.

I also feel that Martin Henderson was a great Will Darcy. I mean Colin Firth will always be the best in my opinion, but he cannot be in every Pride and Prejudice movie made. I could see falling in love with Will Darcy in this movie and that is how I judge his performance.

I do not know anything about the Bollywood movie genre, but I quite enjoyed most of the musical scenes in this movie. For someone else who might not have very much exprience with Bollywood, I could compare the musical numbers to those of a 1940s musical, but modernized. Since I still cruise the cable stations in search of a good movie from that period maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.",1121385600,,1226,4.1645569620253164

Aishwarya Rai was amazing as Lalita Bakshi (Lizzie Bennet) and though Martin Henderson played a weak Darcy, you quickly overlook that when you see the amazing colors and dancing. With all due respect to the other characters, in my mind the best was Mr. Kohli (yes, i'm doing the hand gesture too)with hilarious lines and physical comedy. The soundtrack is great too with the Punjab

Wedding Song, Take Me to Love, and especially No Life Without Wife. This is an amazing film that I won't hesitate to rewatch and tell others about. It is great for families as well with no sex, (a little suggestive during Ashanti's song) as well as no kissing. It is truly an rare gem.",1121299200,,771,4.507142857142857

2309739,5,B0009PBLRM,"I wasn't much of a fan of ""Bend it like Beckham"", so I think this film marks a step up for the director. I've never watched a Bollywood film all the way through, as I don't have the patience to sit through three or four hours of most films, so I was looking forward to watching her borrow the best elements from the Bollywood films (the song and dance routines). I also liked that she borrows heavily from Jane Austen's novel to create an original and clever work of her own (in the vein of ""Clueless"").

I love the Indian actress who plays the lead, with her opinionated comments and strong determination to stand up to anyone who disagrees with her. Her tart tongue, though, makes her not a good bride prospect for Indian males in search of a subservient wife. When she meets Darcy, their worldviews clash and since I knew those two would end up together, its interesting to watch how their opinions change for one another as the film rolls on.

The film is mostly set in Amritsar, India but the Indian family this film centers on ends up globetrotting to London and Beverly Hills. I like how the story seems to offer a critique of both the condescending view many Westerners have of developing world nations (particularly the Western tourist fondness for traveling to luxurious resorts in faraway lands to brag to the folks back home that they've been to India without actually seeing ""the real India"") and the obsession of Indian society towards material social climbing. It's that clash that makes this film all the more interesting and far superior to the usual gamut of cliched ""romantic comedies"".

The opening number ""Marriage Has Come to Town"" really sets the tone for the film and just try to keep your body still for that one. This is a good film to watch at home, as you'll probably want to dance along to the exotic beats of Indian music. Later on in the film, there's a musical sequence reminiscent of ""Grease"" (intentional, according to the director) and a beach rave scene featuring a seductive Ashanti at her best. By the film's end, with its satisfying conclusion, I simply wanted more, which is a good thing. Perhaps that's why Bollywood films are so long...viewers just aren't tired of the story to leave yet, as there are still more dancing to be done. I'm sure Jane Austen herself would approve of this transcultural tribute to one of her most famous novels.",1121126400,,2381,4.637440758293839

This was a wonderful surprise, I had just seen the Pride & Prejudice a latter day comedy, which was alright, when I saw this on Amazon. It is truly wonderful, Martin makes a wonderful Darcy and Aishwarya was a wonderful Elizabeth, they did a terrific job of making this a modern day movie.

I didn't love it quite the way I loved Bend It Like Beckham, but I did love it.  It is hillarious and fun.  It's not Bollywood and it's not Western.  It was MEANT to try to strike a balance between the two.  It has it's Bollywoood moments and it's more Hollywood moments --- it's a blend. A delightful blend.  The director worked very hard to try to find that balance (according to her own statements), and I think she succeeded.  As a lover of Jane Austin, I also loved that it was so faithful to that work --- obvious difference in time and setting, notwithstanding.  I normally don't like modernizations of old stories, but this one just cracked me up!  This movie will not be for everyone.  If you hate musicals - don't bother.  If you hate anything even kind of resembling Indian music, it probably won't be your thing.  That said, the music was deliberately chosen to try to appeal to a western ear, not just Indian audiences.  I'm not a Bollywood fan - I've never seen a full-on Bollywood movie, to be honest.  For me, this movie was like Grease meets Jane Austin set in India ... and I loved every minute of it.  It may not be Beckham, but it is a delightful movie in it's own right.

Martin Henderson has gotten a beating critically for not seeming intimidating--ie, Colin Firth-y--enough. But with only 2 hours to tell this tale and since it's a modern story where that sort of Firth-like manner would just not be tolerated by anyone today, Henderson's Darcy is more  thoughtless than overtly classist, and I think it works. Rai's Lizzie/Lalita is quite confrontational once she decides that DArcy is a jerk, but she works the ""prejudice"" angle nicely and is equal parts gorgeous and spunky.

I really enjoyed this modernized YET old fashioned musical take on the timeless tale. It captures the magic of the original story where we get to watch two headstrong but good hearted people argue their way to punch drunk love! Gurinder Chadha has done it again with a light hearted, entertaining, and uplifting cross-cultural tale!

As a Los Angeles native, Austen groupie, and a bollywood fan, I personally am VERY impressed at how Chadha really kept a wonderful balance among these very diverse influences. She never lets any of the influences dominate, and that's a hard feat.

The result is an incredibly entertaining, cultural and cinematic hybrid that made me smile throughout most of the movie. Instead of worrying if it's ""too"" Bollywood or Hollywood or British or not austen like a enough, I say  appreciate the creative and imagination of the moviemakers to blend diverse styles into such a tasty little cinematic package!

Jane Austen's story is very well played out in the the modern Indian family setting in which arranged marriages and true love are still somewhat prevalent themes today.  The stereotypes of modern India are charmingly brought out in the banter between Rai and Henderson who exhibit the Darcy-Lizzie chracters in the film.  You can't help but laugh and go along with the antics.  Of course, in true Bollywood style, there is a lot of song and dance.

2309746,5,B0009PBLRM,"We have a bunch of  ""straight"" Western musicals and ""straight"" Austen P&P retellings and ""straight"" bollywood musicals-why not mix it up a little bit and have some fun with the different genres, folks? How boring to insist on doing things the same all the time! Chadha tries to breathe new life into this tale, as well as the Western and Bollywood musical genre, and I think she succeeds in a very light hearted, contagiously joyful way.

It reminds me of old style musicals where love is celebrated shamelessly, cynicism is checked at the door, and people are so full of emotion, they sometimes have to break out in song to properly communicate their feelings. What's wrong with that?

Musicals are suppossed to present life in rose technicolored glasses. Chadha delivers this without any apologies or self consciousness. Yes, there are bollywood influences, but this is NOT a straight bollywood musical. Yes, this story plays very closely to Austen's story, but it's NOT a straight retelling of the beloved work. And yes, the director is winking at us the whole time, knowing how our jaded American/Western minds work-just when she almost crosses the line with gushiness and cheesiness(well, cheesiness from our Western perspective) in terms of emotion and drama, she includes some comic relief to let us know she's in on the fun.

So, just enjoy the ride, take in all the colors and music and dance without suspicion, and appreciate the fact that a sweet and romantic love story can be told in this day and age with as much vigor and celebration as this one.

While it does follow Austen's ""Pride & Prejudice"" storyline with an Indian, modern twist on it, I have to confess that my heart is still with the Colin Firth version of P&P.

2309750,5,B0009PBLRM,"This is a very Western movie with some distinct Bollywood-style elements. Some of these Bollywood elements will be helpful to keep in mind: obvious lip synching as most Bollywood stars aren't using their own voices; very chaste love scenes-no kissing involved!; very old fashioned sense of storytelling-ala musicals from the 50's, NOT like musicals like Chicago...heavy on the slapstick, light on the ironic wit.

With that said, Ms. Gurinder takes these Bollywood elements and then transplants them in Western settings like Los Angeles....where you get break-out-in-song sequences that include Mariachi musicians, bartenders, surfers, life guards, and a gospel choir! It's clever to see Ms. Gurinder transpose these bollywood style dance sequences, which seem ""natural"" when in India,  in a different cultural context like LA, with culturally appropriate ""indigenous"" participants!

As for the love story-the only thing I'd change is that Mr. Darcy deserved some more zippy comebacks to Lalita's stinging comments to show he is her equal. That's where Austen's story works so well-the bickering between Darcy and Elizabeth is really a sort of seductive dance between two headstrong people. And Lalita deserved to be shown more playful and light hearted as well like the original story. Of course Lalita is the ""prejudice"" in P&P, but she should lighten up a little still. Other than that, Ms. Rai is a gorgeous and mesmerizing star and Martin Henderson compliments her nicely as a more boyish but charming Mr. Darcy to Colin Firth's more imposing, rigid Darcy.

This is a great movie that puts alot of cultural twists on various things-Austen, bollywood, parental expectations on marriage,musicals,etc. I think it was put together in a clever way, and it's very entertaining. The music is great, I really enjoy all the Amritsar dance sequences, and everyone in this movie is seriously beautiful, men and women! And Mr. Kholi---he is so hilarious! Even my husband, a man who tends to only watch really macho movies and boxing and ultimate fighting, liked it! That's saying something... I'm totally buying this movie for everyone for Christmas.....",1120694400,,2147,5.32448377581121
2309751,4,B0009PBLRM,"This movie is exactly how it sounds, A Bollywood style musical comedy based on Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice. It is made by Gurinder Chadha who also wrote Bend It Like Beckham, so it is flavored with her witt and comedy. I will write 2 outlines, one for those of you who will love this film, and one for those of you who will turn it off half way through......

You Will Love This Movie Because:

  If you like Bend It Like Beckham for it's strong female characters, ethnic flavor, and witty writing you will like B&P for the same reasons. The story centers around a forward thinking Indian woman, one of five sisters. She wants to be married and dreams of romance, but she also wants to be treated like an equal, and not just some man's wife. If you have read/seen Pride & Prejudice you will know pretty much what happens from here. What makes this telling unique are the gorgeous locations all over India, the colors and the flavors of a rich Indian culture, and some really fun musical numbers, both funny and lovely. I also very much enjoyed Monsoon Wedding, which is also full of culture and music. And I believe it is the Indian culture woven through this film that makes it so enjoyable, the music, the cuisine, the location, the clothing and colors. For every film goer that is open to something a little different (and very well done I might add) I highly recommend this film.

You Will Not Like This Movie Because:

  If you saw Bend It Like Beckham, and are expecting more of the same, you might be disappointed. While Bride has some of the witty flavor, it is an entirely different genre. It is a musical, but not in the traditional sense, being filled with big bawdy musical numbers that are not traditional to American cinema. Yes, sometimes it is obvious that there is a bit of lip syncing going on, and there is a sense fantasy where you know all these people would never dance about that way. Unlike Beckham, this is very much and Indian film, (although very much westernized), and there is a certain style to a Bollywood film that makes a lot of traditional film goers uncomfortable. So for those of you who like the big summer blockbuster type movies, whether they are brainless or not, and are easily bored with foreign/musical/dramatic movies,this film may require a little to much of an open mind for you.

But, when all is said and done, I loved this movie (and I like big summer movies too), and any film done well is a film for me. Bride & Prejudice will be among my favorites.",1120608000,,2504,4.473684210526316
2309752,5,B0009PBLRM,"""Bride and Prejudice"" is a lot of fun.  I have never seen a ""Bollywood"" movie before, so this was a totally new experience for me.  I liked the orgy of bright colors and was intrigued by the dancing, which certainly made the songs more memorable for their rhythms than their lyrics.  But what is wrong with that?  Dancing with a sense of grace seems beyond me, but I think I could do some of the dances in this movie and lose some weight.  Especially if I am trying to do the extended versions of the four big dance numbers provided in the special features.  They were, to repeat the initial sentiment expressed above, fun.  It has been a while since I have seen a movie and just had fun watching it.  After all, I know what is going to happen, so stressing style over substance is fine with me.

I found the idea of putting Jane Austen's novel in the context of a modern family in India totally charming at face value, especially knowing that director Gurinder Chadha (""Bend It Like Beckahm"") was the one making the movie.  My familiarity with the story of the Bennett family is such that I was instantly able to recognize who was now who in the new configuration and what the corresponding scene from the novel would be for most of what was happening.  I liked a lot of what they did in this regard, such as transforming Mary's piano playing debacle into an equally overplayed example of traditional Indian dance by Maya (Meghna Kothari).  None of the transformations were heavy handed, which can be dangerous in an attempt such as this, and the key thing was the delight of discovering each act of translation.

I even figured out that Mrs. Darcy (Marsha Mason) was going to be the Lady Catherine de Bourgh character and was somewhat surprised that the scene where she insists that Lalitha not marry her son ended up in the deleted scenes.  That is the pivotal scene in the novel, the point at which it suddenly dawns on Elizabeth that marrying Mr. Darcy is not the worst thing in the world, but its omission in ""Bride and Prejudice"" makes sense because the script by Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges moves his first proposal to much latter in the narrative.  I agree that what made sense for a story set amongst the landed gentry of Hanoverian England does not necessarily work for modern India, so the change was a smart move.  Besides, Lalitha has a scene where she goes toe-to-toe with Mrs. Darcy, which is the other important aspect of the scene.  Consequently, Chadha and Berges have shown the requisite fidelity to the essence and key details of the Austen novel even as they change locations and nationalities.

It is not like the universality of ""Pride and Prejudice"" was every lost on us in the first place, even as we have come to admire Austen's attention to period detail and socially attuned characterizations.  The Bakshi family lives in a rural town in India where the mother (Nadira Babbar) is wholly committed to getting her four daughters married, while her husband (Anupam Khre) endures the trials and tribulations of her frantic efforts.  When Jaya (Namrata Shirodkar) and Balraj Bingley (Naveen Andrews) spark when they meet at a wedding it looks like the dreams of Mrs. Bakshi will come true for one of her girls.  But William Darcy (Martin Henderson) disapproves of Balraj's interest, which gives Lalitah (Aishwarya Rai), the oldest daughter and the one always being warned by her mother not to seem too intelligent, another reason not to like him.

Darcy is to some extent an Ugly American in this incarnation, which lets the second key word of the title resonate in a slightly different way in this version, but not too much, because a bigoted Mr. Darcy is not going to be accepted by anybody.  That is also why the subplot involving Johnny Wickham (Daniel Gillies) and Lakhi (Peeya Rai Chowdhary) is a tad differently.  Again, this all shows the screenwriters understood what they were doing in translating Austen's novel to the screen in this fashion, and reinforces the idea that the primary purpose here was to have fun.  For all I know the musical numbers here are only second-rate Bollywood extravaganzas, in which case I cannot wait to see what else is out there.  The bottom line here is simple: you have to know going in whether or not you buy the idea of turning Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" into a Bollywood number.  If you think that is a great idea, then you will enjoy this 2004 film.  If you think that sounds weird, then lighten up.  You are missing out on the fun here.",1120608000,,4519,4.634880803011292
2309753,2,B0009PBLRM,"I'm a fan of Bend it Like Beckham and am also a fan of musicals and romance and comedy and therefore was hopeful when I picked this up at the video store to rent.  As for the romance, comedy, and culture, this movie is pretty good I have to admit and I enjoyed all those aspects.

I was however highly disapointed with the musical aspect of it.  Not the cultural dances mind you but the scenes with singing that emphasize the state of mind of the characters in the movie.  The lip syncing was awful and distracting and a lot of the added elements that happen around the main performers when musical sequences are going on, (like the singing surfers coming out of the water with a board in one hand above their heads and the other hand outstretched towards the couple) seem ill thought out and elementary.  The elements of the musical sequences feel like first idea that pops in ones head, that although fun, is usually not a ready product and should be refined through many rough drafts before being exposed to the masses.  But nope, the musical scenes feel like a bunch of first ideas strung together.

The songs are annoying lyrically and in terms of hooks and melody, also suffer from this ""first idea"" sydrome.

All in all I suppose I'm critical mostly because the rest of the movie was  good, and then the musical scenes came a long.  It just seems that the music sections were created by a mere FAN of musicals and not by someone who really knows all the wonderful details and elements that go into making a good musical.  Still watch the movie for everything else.

note:The Ashanti song which was advertised on the back cover of the DVD box was also an awful over produced song (even for her) that is completely forgetable.",1120521600,,1731,4.49520766773163
2309754,4,B0009PBLRM,"Bride and Prejudice is as bright as an East Indian color palette, and as precious as the forehead jewels of its lovely stars.  The story takes us globe-hopping between a placid Indian farming community with a shining golden temple, to lively London, and then to the ""Must-Be-The Money"" capital, my dear home, Los Angeles. Take your kids.  It's safe, visual stimulation and fun.  Most of the songs are in English and, if not, subtitles or characters' comments make it clear what is going on.

  If you are not familiar with East Indian films and the whole Bollywood-style of moviemaking then permit this film to be your introduction.  Watch for the rules.

 #1-no kissing,  #2-family values always win in the end,  #3-MGM musicals had it right;  boy does meet girl, lose her and finally win her at the finale, and oh yes, my personal favorite, #4-It's ok to break into song-and-dance to express characters' emotions or as a vehicle for advancing the plot.

 This serviceable plot is based on the Victorian, Jane Austin novel, Pride and Prejudice.  If you're a PBS or BBC viewer then this story of four, lovely but middle-class daughters being married off to the most eligible, economic prospects by their overly energetic mother will be familiar to you.  Only the faces, century, and Western culture have been changed, and a pulsating East Indian musical score added.

 Speaking of faces, the leading ladies of this film are two of the best examples of beauty on the planet today.  Aishwarya Rai who plays the lead is renowned for her incredible blue-green eyes.  Even Julia Roberts once acknowledged her as the most beautiful woman in films today and I doubt that you'll disagree with that pretty lady once you've seen Ash (as her fans call her) in Bride.  Ash is a former Miss World, and Namatra Shirodokar who plays her big sister is a former Miss Universe runner-up.  Their incredible looks make the plot a bit creditable.  You can believe in love at first sight;  that a high-powered London lawyer and his college pal, an American hotel magnate (both definite Alpha-males) would fall head- over-saris for these exquisite Alpha-females even if they are simply farmers' daughters.  The most glamorous farmer's daughters since Loretta Young in the 1940's movie of the same title !

 Believe it or not,  Bride  is not worth seeing simply for its photogenic stars.  No indeed,  Ash and the other cast members can sing, dance and act well enough to almost make you forget how your jaw dropped the first time you saw Ash in close-up on the big screen.  Like Sophia Loren, and other screen sirens of that caliber,  Ash has no bad camera angles.  Don't hate her because she's truly beautiful.

 More importantly,  even if someone less than the crown jewel of Bollywood cinema had been in the lead role, Bride would be worthy of a `look-see'.  The film knows itself, and  has its tongue firmly planted in its cheek about the musical format; never taking itself too seriously.

 Being a lifelong Angelino,  my favorite part was when the story shifts to L.A. and you see bartenders shaking margaritas in tempo, and surfers singing at Santa Monica Beach.  I'm sure they got our  locals to ""go Hollywood"" very easily.  Yes,  I love L.A., and I love Bride.  I am not ashamed to admit that I've seen Bride numerous times now;  first with an audience full of East Indians in Irvine who roared in laughter at the green-card-holder, expatriate Mr. Kholi seeking a traditional Indian bride to bring back to his `crib' in L.A.., and last with a typical L.A. mix of suburbanites who chuckled in all the right places too. Each time was a great time at the movies.  Feast your eyes. Go see Bride on the big screen and then buy it for its vibrancy will shine on DVD.",1120348800,,3745,4.731782945736434
2309755,4,B0009PBLRM,"Gurinder Chadha serves a colorful romantic comedy inspired by the novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.  She continues in her analysis of the Indian patriarchal society, as she did in Bend It Like Beckham (2002).  The difference here is that she is not dealing with a culture clash within one country, but brings directly to culture clash and the prejudices of different coutnries.  She also blends cultural diversity into the film, as she did in her brilliant What's Cooking? (2000) that deals with four families with different ethnic background living opposite each other at a street crossing.  This time, however, Chadha brings the people from different continents, which accentuates the differences between the characters and the environment.  In addition, the characters bring their own values and beliefs to the country they are visiting, which could mean trouble.  This sets up for interesting comedy in the light of Bollywood cinema that merges with Hollywood glamour that is full of both song and dance.

Cinematographer Santosh Sivan who many recognize as the director for the visually stunning The Terrorist (1999) gives Bride & Prejudice an authentic Bollywood feel.  In addition the camerawork fits wonderfully with the story that is being told. The film opens with a swift camera pan that moves over a field while locking onto a red tractor on which the heroine of the film rides.  Her name is Lalitha Bakshi (Aishwarya Rai) and the scene suggests that she is not afraid of working among men, or above them.  This might be an unacceptable position for a woman according to some Indians.  Nonetheless, it is clear that Lalitha is a free spirit from the opening scene who follows her own way, which might go against Indian traditions.  Through a number of interchanging cuts between the fields of India and a plane that is landing the audience can also learn about William Darcy (Martin Henderson).  Darcy is a young and rich hotel mogul who is quick to point out the differences between India and United States.  He is going along with his friend Balraj (Naveen Andrews) and his friend's sister who are attending a wedding in Amritsar, India. Darcy's arrival displays an unfortunate culture shock that comes across with a combination of ignorance and arrogance that easily can be perceived as prejudice.

At the wedding Balraj discovers stunning beauty and so does Darcy.  Hypnotized by the appearance of beautiful Lalitha, Darcy approaches her.  However, they get off on the wrong foot, as he opens his mouth and looks like a prejudicial fool.  This relationship continues to sour, as they find out that they have to remain in each other's company for an extended time.  It is comical to see these two argue, as they look like the perfect couple.  Nonetheless, they do not get along and it makes Darcy's stay in India very difficult, as he also seems to have some strong feelings for her.  Intermittently, the story line is interrupted by song and dance in traditional Bollywood style where colors are plentiful and all the cast comes along in joyous dance.  It is cheesy and corny, yet wonderfully fantastic as Chadha incorporates the traditional Bollywood style, which often has numbers of both song and dance in the Indian films.

Director Chadha, an Indian born in Kenya while raised in England, concocts a predictable romantic comedy that really makes people feel good while reaching across cultures.  Her background could offer an additional reason why she has a strong personal interest in making and sharing this wonderful story.  It almost seems as if Chadha submerges the film with her own experiences, yet it has an intelligent and witty touch of the cultural divides between India and other nations.  Sure it is an easily consumable comedy, yet she succeeds in delivering a remarkable punch when it comes to feminist and ethnic issues in India as well.  Her approach to comedy and warmth is brilliant, as it is easier to make people listen and watch when the message comes across nicely instead of with raging anger.  Through her observations of the world caricature like characters come into sight such as one of my favorites Mr. Kholi (Nitin Chandra Ganatra).  Mr. Kholi is painfully unaware of his manners both verbally and behaviorally, however, one cannot help but to like this nerdish guy and watch him try to find a wife.  In the end, Chadha ties together the different ethnic groups in terrific film inspired by Jane Austen that has a touch of Bollywood magic and a true Hollywood Cinderella ending.",1120348800,,4537,4.962962962962963
2309756,4,B0009PBLRM,"This adaptation revolves around Mr & Mrs Bakshi & their daughters Lakhi (Lydia), Lalita (Lizzie), Jaya (Jane) & Maya (Mary). Think Pride & Prejudice; now think Bollywood. An Exceptional script with vibrant music! Voila! an instant hit.

The casting is exceptional; especially the brilliant Aishwarya Rai as Lalita -besides you know she's got something if Julia Roberts calls her ""The Most Beautiful Woman In the World""- Martin Henderson is an appalling pick for the role of Darcy. His acting often leaves much to be desired, and he occasionally looks out of place in the movie. Him & Aishwarya don't quite share an on-screen chemistry; which is a shame, but it's not enough to ruin the movie.

In conclusion the movie is well written -of course it has to be; its Jane Austin's Classic- & well directed, most of the performances are impressive -except that of Henderson & the musical numbers add to the inspiration of the movie.

Overall its quite an enjoyable, colorful, lively and entertaining movie that has stayed true to the original story. And if Aishwarya Rai doesn't make it in Hollywood after this, then there's no justice in the world after all.

It is great family entertainment!  There are alot more beautiful actresses than just Aishwarya Rai coming from India.  In fact, although she is very beautiful, she's not even in MY top 10 favorite Bollywood actresses.  I have so many favorites.  Indian actresses are all drop dead gorgeous.  A few of my personal favorites are:
  Rani Mukherjee
  Sonali Bendre
  Urmila Matondkar
  Amisha Patel
  Kajol
  Priyanka Chopra
  Tanisha Mukherjee (Kajol's sister)
  Madhuri Dixit
  Shilpa Shetty
  Kareena and Karisma Kapoor (sisters)
  Aarti Chabria

  Aishwarya Rai ..and then
  Sushmita Sen
  Preity Zinta
  Mahek Chahal
  Suman Ranganathan
  Namrata Shiradkar (plays Jaya in this film)
  Tabu
  Manisha Koirala
  Tara Sharma
  Neha Dhupia
  Lara Dutta
  Mahima Chaudhary
  Mink Singh
  Preity Jhangiani
  Shamita Shetty
  Deepal Shaw
  .....etc. etc. etc.

....I could probably name about 10 more actresses that I love, plus there are usually other beautiful girls who just happen to be in the films as extras to fill a scene, but, you get the picture.  I love Bollywood actresses and I am hooked on Bollywood films.  And Indira Varma and Naveen Andrews are both here in this film.  They were together nearly 10 years ago in Mira Nair's ""Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love"".  I believe Indira Varma look's better with long hair.  I guess in ""Bride and Prejudice"" they probably prefered to have the audience focus on the beauty of Aishwarya Rai and the other three who were her sisters in the film.

If you'd like to see pictures of these beautiful actresses, go to IndiaFM.com and click on wallpapers (no nudes, just beautiful people.)

Girls that I know who follow Bollywood films love these actors:  Hrithik Roshan, Shahrukh Khan, Bobby Deol, Salman Khan, Aftaab Shivdasani, Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham, Uday Chopra, Fardeen Khan, Arjun Rampal, Vivek Oberoi, Aamir Khan, and Ajay Devgan (Kajol's husband)...just to name a few.

Also, go to IMDb.com (Internet Movie Data Base) to enter these stars names, and find out what movies they have done.  Even Aishwarya Rai has probably more than 30 films.  If you don't mind reading subtitles, then Bollywood films will be your next movie obsession, just like me.  It may take a little patience to understand and accept Hindi music, but the sexy videos that you will be watching will keep that music in your head.  Having a musical film is no more different than any Walt Disney film.

I appreciate that Ashanti got to participte in a simular Bollywood video, in the film.  I hope MTV plays it and helps to introduce Indian music and the exciting, beautiful, dance videos to the american audience.

I think Hollywood is afraid of Bollywood.  If Indian films started to come to america,at a massive volume, the ""plain jane"" look of american actresses would suddenly be threatened by the grace and beauty of the Bollywood actress.",1118188800,,3059,4.9282868525896415

This is a light, happy movie with fun dances, stupid songs, old-Hollywood-musical crowd scenes, and beautiful costumes.  Aishwarya Rai is beautiful and charismatic.  When she's on screen, you always notice her.  Naveen Andrews is very cute as well, though he's best when dancing at the beginning.  I think that they tried to make it too close to Pride & Prejudice, and that's where the movie has problems.  They should have taken a page from Bridget Jones' Diary, which follows the original story looser.  They should have just stayed dancing in Amritsar.

This doesn't even come close because its neither true Bollywood nor Hollywood, but simply a loose coupling of both. No attention has been given to details, especially in the sets staged in Goa and scenes of Punjab state. Acting is shallow, especially by Rai (Lead Actress). Chaddha needs to learn more from the likes of Mira Nair and Rai should give up acting complex roles now.",1115337600,,608,4.691588785046729
2309763,4,B0009PBLRM,"I must say that growing up in western society, but having watched Bollywood films all my life, I really enjoyed this film.  It's a blend of Bollywood and Hollywood and it's a very good attempt at it.

Fair enough, the songs may be a bit much for fans of more conventional Hollywood films and can be pretty cheesey, but though they don't do much for the plot, they can entertain.

The main win with this film is that the adaptation works.  The way that they have incorporated the major point of Pride and Prejudice and adapted them actuallly work quite well, thanks to the simularity between the typical Indian culture and the way that marriages used to work.

This film is light and entertaining.  I love it.

And if that doesn't convince you, Martin Henderson and Aishwarya Rai are both beautiful...",1114646400,,800,4.631205673758865
2309764,3,B0009PBLRM,"Lalita (Aishwarya Rai) is one of four daughters in a traditional Indian family. Her cousin's marriage brings family from far and wide. One of the family friends is Balraj (Naveen Andrews, currently on TVs ""Lost"") and his sister, Kiran. Balraj is a barrister in London and all of Lalita's sisters take a second look at him. Balraj has brough his American friend, Will Darcy (Martin Henderson), the heir to a luxury hotel chain, along for the ride. Darcy is immediately drawn to Lalita, but both people are concerned about the culture clash and no small amount of miscommunication keeps them apart.

Traveling from Amritsar, a small town in India, to Goa, to London, to Beverly Hills and back to London and Amritsar, ""Bride and Prejudice"", Gurinder Chadha's follow-up to ""Bend It Like Beckham, has a scope that is probably too big for it's own good. Attempting to meld Bollywood musicals and Western dramas with English literature, the film is successful. But it is most successful when the story is anchored to India.

Within minutes of the credits, Andrews and every other Indian male at the wedding party bursts into an elaborate, fun to watch dance that is meant to be a sort of mating dance. Then the women, including Lalita and her three sisters joins in. Darcy watches from a balcony above and resists Balraj's attempts to get him to join in. The dance is fun, frenetic and very ""Bollywood"". This dance is also a terrific way to introduce the viewer to the world of Bollywood. Let's face it, most Westerners would probably find a Bollywood musical number at least a little strange. Due to the lack of musicals produced in Hollywood, we just aren't used to watching people spontaneously break out into song. In India, this is apparently hugely popular. Many of their films contain this type of musical interlude.

When the film is set in India, the characters interact with Darcy and he is the outsider. When it moves to London and Beverly Hills, Lalita and her family become the outsiders. This shift, while necessary from a dramatic viewpoint, makes them appear slightly oafish and too comical. It really diminishes the intelligence of this Indian family.

The idea of mixing Bollywood-style musical numbers with western storytelling is not a new one. There have been a couple of less successful examples in the last few years. ""Predjudice"" falls short when the story moves to the West. As Darcy and Lalita are walking along the beach in Santa Monica, a chorus of church choir singers suddenly appears, singing. A couple of lifeguards and a few surfers also join in. This is a novel idea, but the number is not as large or elaborately choreographed as it's Bollywood cousins and it falls short.

""Bride and Prejudice"" works very hard to try to blend all of the various styles and influences that are at work here, and it succeeds, for the most part. If you are unable to overlook the less imaginative, slower, more serious Western influences, you might actually enjoy a quick glimpse into a culture that deserves more attention.",1113264000,,3034,4.838150289017341
2309765,5,B0009PBLRM,"What drew me to ""Bride and Prejudice"", first and foremost, was that this promised to be a modern day, Bollywood version of Jane Austen's beloved novel ""Pride and Prejudice."" As a fervent Austen fan, I knew I just couldn't pass this movie up. Secondly, it is directed by Gurinder Chadha whose previous film ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is one of my favorite feel-good movies ever.

I had never been exposed to Bollywood filmmaking before this movie. The closest thing I ever got to Indian culture is the food (which I love), Chadha's ""Bend It..."" film and an earlier viewing of ""Monsoon Wedding."" I had no idea what to expect.  The lively and vibrant songs and dances, beautiful and colorful costumes, memorable and endearing characters, and faithful re-telling of Austen's novel that makes up ""Bride and Prejudice"" just caught me by surprise.

And what a ride it has been!  Gurinder Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges did an excellent job of following Jane Austen's storyline; that of a middle class family (the Bakshi = Bennets) in a relatively small town (Meryton, England = Amritsar, India) and the mother's struggle to marry off her daughters (the book had 5, the film has 4 as Mary and Kitty's characters are combined into the sitar-playing, cobra-dancing 3rd sister Maya). The film begins as the Bakshi (Bennet) family attends a wedding party and everyone is abuzz when the wealthy barrister Mr. Balraj (""Lost's"" Naveen Andrews) shows up with his elegant and fashionable sister Kiran (Indira Varma) and American hotelier/best friend Will Darcy (the gorgeous Martin Henderson). Balraj falls instantly for beautiful eldest sister Jaya (Namrata Shirodkar). Will slights the outspoken and spirited 2nd sister Lalita (Aishwarya Rai) by his careless comments about her hometown (""Hicksville, India""?) and she immediately takes a dislike to his arrogant, close-minded ways.  At the beach resort in Goa, Lalita meets the free-spirited Johnny Wickham (Daniel Gillies) and is immediately attracted to him. She slowly learns, however, that Wickham is not what he seems.  It also becomes clear that youngest sister Lakhi (Peeya Rai Choudhary) also fancies the charming Wickham.  In the meantime, a distant relative, Mr. Kohli (Nitin Ganatra) comes to visit the Bakshi family with the intent of finding a wife. Mrs. Bakshi immediately pairs him up to Lalita, much to her chagrin and displeasure. After all, Lalita means to marry for love and the cocky, goofy and self-absorbed Mr. Kohli (the scene- stealing role) is far from her idea of the 'ideal man'.  Events take Lalita and her family to London and then Los Angeles where circumstances throw her and Will Darcy together. In LA, Lalita meets Will's mother, Catherine (Marsha Mason), and younger sister Georgina (Alexis Bledel).  Lalita soon realizes that she may have misjudged Will and a romance blossoms between them. However, revelations come into the surface that threaten to tear the Will and Lalita apart. Those familiar with Jane Austen's book will know how it all ends, of course. Those who don't will have to see this film to find out!

After seeing B&P, I have come to develop a deeper interest and appreciation for Indian culture.  The fantastic choreography in dance sequences like ""Balle Balle"" and ""Dola Dola"" are vibrant and mesmerizing. The costumes are nothing short of dazzling.  I don't think I've ever seen as many beautiful women as I have in this film. Aishwarya Rai and Martin Henderson have a chemistry that makes their attraction entirely plausible.  They are a pleasure to watch.  I came out of the movie theater with a big smile on my face and found myself humming the songs for days.  I admit that there are some scenes that border on silly or cheesy but this film never really does take itself seriously.  At the end of the day, it is a film that is meant to be fun and entertaining.  I have since seen ""Bride and Prejudice"" 3x and can't wait for the dvd!! ""Bride and Prejudice"" is a joyful and intoxicating movie experience and, as Mr. Kohli says, ""I'd happily get drunk on it!!!!""",1113004800,,4047,4.954209748892171
2309766,2,B0009PBLRM,"Being the huge Austen fan that I am, I am always very interested to see any new takes on the immortal tale of 'Pride and Prejudice'. 'Clueless' and 'Briget Jones' Diary' as well as the contemporary remake of 'Pride and Prejudice' from a year or two ago all have some redeeming features as they loosely follow the plot laid down in Jane Austen's immortal classic novel of social manners and turbulent love, but never before has a remake been set to music.

Enter 'Bride and Prejudice'.

The romantic musical comedy, thanks to 'Moulin Rouge', is something that has experieced something of a resurgence of late, and, hand-in-hand with the ever-widening appeal of contemporary Indian cinema, has led to a number of truly great Indian musicals over the last few years - titles such as ""I Have Found It"" and ""Once Upon A Time In India"" certainly hit the Bollywood Happy Buttons, being riotous, enchanting and colourful paeans to the Musical genre.

""Bride and Prejudice"", then, has all the ingredients for success - the classic tale of Boy-May-Not-Get-Girl, the sumptuous and beautiful setting of contemporary Indian cinema, and the Zeitgeisty appeal of All Things Eurasian - but it never really manages to capitalise on any of these things before the end of the movie, and what we're left with is a dreary sort of 'Bollywood Lite' version of a dumbed-down 'Pride and Prejudice'.

Mrs. Bashki's mind is set on marriage, and while her eldest daughter is making strong romantic headway with her Raj, her second daughter Lalita has declared that she will not marry for anything other than love. Enter WIll Darcey, the infuriating and seemingly insensitive American, and his mortal enemy Wickham, the charming and new-age British traveller, and Lalita, while drawn initially to the latter, must overlook the obvious defects of the former if she is to find true happiness.

Aishwarya Rai and Martin Henderson are remarkably beautiful people, and, when all is said and done, do decent jobs with the roles they are given. Rai, in particular, brings a beguiling sort of feistiness to the role of Lalita that is perfectly inkeeping with Austen's original heroine. The supporting case is of a very high standard, in particular Nadira Babbar and Anupam Kher as Mrs and Mr Bashki respectively give star turns as the comic relied.

Direction is, unfortunately, stagey and flat. Most of the musical numbers take place indoors, and suffer a sense of the claustrophobic and unfilfilled because of this. Yes, it's colourful, it's vibrant, and it's beautiful, but compared to other recent Bollywood musical offerings, it's a hodge-podge mix of East meets West in the most under-used of ways. The nightclub scene on the beach is a perfect examle of this, you're constantly looking for more from these set-pieces, but it sadly never comes. Similarly annoying are the lyrics to the songs; they are childish and morose and are really more suited to things like 'American Idol' and suchlike.

But it's not all bad news. The plot, thanks to Ms. Austen, is fast-paced and enthralling, and, if you've never seen another adaptation of 'Pride and Prejudice' before, this is as good a place to start as any. It's just a pity that the most important elements of this movie are so very underutilised.

Throughout this journey we see the struggles that she faces with her family and her struggles with the love interests in her life. She is faced with opportunity to do what will please her family or what her heart really wants. In the end, she finally makes a decision that everyone appears to be happy with. I loved the movie! The movie does a great job of keeping your attention and it also leaves you wanting to know what will happen next!
I have never seen a Bollywood movie(I realize its not 100% a true Bollywood film)but I loved it. It have drama, music, dance, love, comedy, and much more! I especially loved the outfits! They were so brightly colored and had such intricate designs! Im not a huge fan of musicals, but I didn't mind this because the music was so upbeat and was paired with huge dance scenes.
Some interesting cultural treasures that I noticed were things like the extravagant weddings. Wedding in Indian culture are huge extravaganzas with lots of color, lots of people, and lots of tradition. I also found the way they arranged marriages interesting because I assumed that the child had no say in their spouse at all, but they technically didn't have to have an arranged marriage at all. I was surprised by how much input the child had in the marriage. I think the best tradition was how united and sacred the family was and how that was so important to them!",1524528000,,1536,4.469750889679715
8064656,4,B0009PBLRM,"Film Review Bride and Prejudice
I can easily say this film was entertaining, romantic and unique to anything I have ever seen before. Will Darcy an american falls in love with Lalita a traditional Indian woman. Lalita is someone who is so different and intriguing Will can not resist. This movie has many climaxes and shocking moments to keep the audience on their feet. For example Will tells Lalita how he feels about her, but despite her true feelings and Wills efforts, Lalita choses to walk away due to family circumstances. Little did Lalita know Will runs after her and saves her sister from what could have been a huge mistake. Although Lalita and Will being together will be complicated Will does not care because he expresses that he loves her. I personally loved the film. I thought they chose amazing characters and kept me smiling, laughing and entertained throughout the whole time.

I am very new to bollywood films and would most definitely see another movie like this one. At first, I thought there was too much singing but after the first day it became apart of the experience of the film overall and I did not mind it. I really love how bollywood movies try to incorporate all genres into one film. It always keeps the audience entertained and on edge. In the film they did this by using comedy, romance and action scenes. Also in bollywood films I loved the dancing I think it not only added to the culture but the overall feel for the film itself. I feel like this film was hollywood with a hint of bollywood. Not too much of either.

The director chooses to let the audience view two perspectives. One outside perspective, Will Darcy and one inward perspective, Lalita. Both stubbornly battle for their opinion on India but eventually find common ground and some compromise. Lalita has extreme pride for her culture and country. She would not let anyone not even Will Darcy a rich, handsome man talk her down. You can see that through the difference in culture the director is trying to teach the audience about misconceptions and or misunderstandings on people's view on Indian culture and people. With that being said there culture is nothing but beautiful. The customs and traditions of waiting for marriage to have interactions with men so to speak is one that shows respect and devotion. It is supposed to be hard to win over a beautiful, pure indian woman but once you are committed you become apart of their family too. Indian families take over when marriage is involved not only are you marrying the person but also their family. We see this taking place in weddings and social get togethers these families attend. Indian families go outside of the remote family and into friends and their culture to spread love and unity which is shown in the dancing, singing and traditions found in this culture.",1524528000,,2830,4.738336713995944
8064657,4,B0009PBLRM,"In Western culture, Bollywood films are considered strange and outlandish. Gurinder Chahad attempts to bridge the gap between the two cultures by creating a film that incorporates Bollywood culture into a Western movie. Bride and Prejudice not only bridges the cultural gap film-wise, but it also addresses some stereotypical differences between the two cultures. Darcy, an American businessman, travels to India to try to purchase a hotel to create a tourist attraction. He thinks it will be good for him because he will benefit financially, and good for the Indian people because others will learn their culture. Lalita, an Indian woman, crosses paths with him and thinks his idea is one-sided, and the tourists won't get the true culture of India. They then proceed to fall in and out of love, with Lalitas parents eager for her to get married to a wealthy and successful man, like Darcy. I enjoyed the movie because I feel that it did a good job at introducing the Bollywood culture to Western viewers.
 My first experience with the Bollywood genera was the song and music video Chaiyya Chaiyya. Unlike Bride and Prejudice, this was a full-blown Bollywood film. The way that the actors move and perform is vastly different and more exaggerated than what we are used to in Western culture. Bride and Prejudice does a good job at keeping the exaggerated feel of Bollywood, yet putting it in a way that western viewers can understand and enjoy. I don't think any western viewer would view this work as completely outlandish.
 Along with the culture in the film industry, Bride and Prejudice also addresses the cultural differences between Indian and western culture. In the film, Chahad shows how important marriage and family are in the Indian culture, versus how western culture is more success and financially oriented. It also shows how marriage is usually arranged in Indian culture and touches on how strange that is for people who grew up with western ideas. I think that its interesting how valued family and love is in the Indian culture; however, they still typically have arranged marriages. Overall, I think Bride and Prejudice did a fantastic job at blending the two cultures, both in reality and in the film industry.",1524528000,,2232,4.96524064171123
8064658,5,B0009PBLRM,"The film, Bride and Prejudice, combines the aspects of a Bollywood film as well as a Hollywood film. The film follows various romantic relationships between the characters of the film. However, it mainly focuses on the romantic relationship of Lalita Bakshi and William Darcy and the cultural experiences they learn. Both characters are from different sides of world and only completely understand the cultures they know. Until the meet each other, they are unaware of the cultural lessons that await. As this being the first Bollywood style film Ive seen before, I did enjoy this film as I was able to comprehend the events transpiring. This film is a perfect blend of what Ive previously known in Western films and my unfamiliarity with Bollywood movies. Each style of filmmaking holds aspects unseen within the other. This particular films steals Western dialogue and implements Bollywood traditions of romance and marriage. Not once in the film, between each romantic relationship, is a moment of traditional Western film style intimacy is shown to depict their love for one another. Instead, traditional Bollywood song and dance resemble how one another feel for each other. The movie will build up romantic suspense between two characters, but will then leave what occurred up to the viewers imagination. Another aspect included in this film, it a lot more dialogue than a normal Bollywood film. Dialogue is key in Western films showing that Bride and Prejudice includes aspects of both cultures. Adjusting to a new cultures traditions is also difficult for some as seen with William Darcy. His character initially brings with him a sense of backlash and almost a sense of being naive once introduced to Indian culture. He does not understand the ways of Indian culture as he has never experienced it before which causes negative feedback from characters like Lalita. As the film progresses, Mr. Darcy begins to realize his initial mistakes and begins to adjust to Lalitas culture. Once he shows his true colors, Lalita accepts him for a romantic relationship. More importantly, her family accepts him as well. This is a very important in Indian cultures. In most cases, the family chooses a suitor for their children to ensure they are with someone they know to be someone to take care of their family member. It is important for their culture to know who their childs spouse is before marriage. For Lalita, her family accepts William Darcy as a candidate for marriage once they see his true self. They have more challenging time getting to know each other compared to Lalita's sisters. While Lalita struggles with finding a partner, her sisters are seen as a more typical Indian style arranged marriage. They marry a partner chosen for them by their parents with little to no hardships. Lalita faces more hardships finding the correct person for herself, but eventually it all works out. For anyone who is new to the industry of Bollywood films, this film is definitely accessible to all. It combines areas from two cultures and mixes them together into a great film. I would definitely recommend it to anyone new to Indian culture and interested in learning about the style of Bollywood film.",1524528000,,3201,5.018796992481203
8064659,5,B0009PBLRM,"Pride and Prejudice meets modern India?! If that sounds interesting to you, Bride and Prejudice is a great movie to watch. Set in modern India about a traditional family, a young woman named Lalitas parents expect their daughters to all get married quickly to wealthy men because arranged marriages are very common in India. Lalita is rather picky if her suitors and nearly gives her mother a heart attack. When her family attends the wedding of a friend, she meets William Darcy, a friend of a friend of the bride. At first she is annoyed by his arrogance and lack of knowledge for Indian culture, but as the movie goes on she begins to fall for him. Lots of twists, surprises, and unfortunate events stand in Lalita and her sisters ways of finding love. This film binds Western and Eastern cultures to create a modern love story with a title and ideas based off of the Jane Austen original novel. I loved the film because it was the perfect mix of Bollywood and Hollywood movies all in one production.
  As this film was my first experience with the Bollywood genre, I was not sure that I would like it at first, but the characters and lively music hooked me from the beginning. The dancing and singing made me wish that all movies included elaborately clothed actors and actresses, getting across dramatic messages through song. I knew going in that there would be some music and exotic costumes of course, but the extravagant details were especially fun to experience! I loved the perfect combination of Western and Eastern cultures. As I usually only watch Western movies made in Hollywood, this was a breath of fresh air with new values at the center of the plot.
  The cultural elements that the director got across using character dialogue in specific scenes were new to me. For example, a conversation between two characters about American views of India and how Americans could never appreciate India for its true worth surprised me. The following songs they sang supported the ideas of the dialogue even further. I had no idea before this film of the stereotypes that both Western and Eastern cultures have of one another. The director did an excellent job of getting this idea across using the characters of Lalita and Darcy, as it is the main controversy of the film. I also learned a lot about Indian weddings from the multiple weddings featured in this movie, and the aspects that are necessary to weddings in their culture. Watching this film was an enjoyable, great learning experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",1524528000,,2545,4.764172335600907
