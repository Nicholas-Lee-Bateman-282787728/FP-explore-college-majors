8754583,5,B01D01K5FK,"I had bought HITLER AND THE OCCULT dvd last week and was disappointed. this dvd MORE than makes up for it. it spends about an hour from the occult perspective.  I have ALWAYS been interested in THE SPEAR OF DESTINY. the narrator referred to it as "" the spear that killed Jesus "". but Jesus was dead BEFORE the Spear pierced Him. so either [A] he is misinforming the viewers... or [B] he knows the secret behind It and is misleading the viewers. other than that, I found the purchase well worth it.",1522886400,,497,4.344086021505376
