 why Clark Gable made it big in Hollywood. he makes you feel good whenever
 he speaks or smiles. And the love between Lombard and Gable was apparent
 even if they did not feel it themselves a great couple a great movie",1184198400,2,286,4.071428571428571
677939,4,6303560059,"A comedy this is not.

This is an interesting little film that could not have been made after after the code crackdown.  The story line is an amoral one if not down right immoral.  Gable plays the hero--a crooked gambler. Lombard plays a had-it-up-to-here small town girl ready to escape at the first offer.  Lucky girl, Gable is the first offer.  They marry on impulse, he thinking it is for laughs while she sees good in him that no one else can see, espcially those of us watching the film.

He draws her into his crooked gambling schemes then tries to shake her but see won't leave him.  I suppose, if we stretch the point, her love for him redeems him some.  Can one be a little bit redeemed?

Subject matter, a lack of moral characters, shower and clothes-changing scenes and see thru dresses make this film that was not shown on TV often I am sure.  But as the only screen pairing of Gable and Lombard it is worth owning.",1183334400,37,928,4.374269005847953

677941,4,6303560059,"Clark Gable plays a high-stakes gambler who decides to cool his heels in a small town near NYC when he feels the law breathing too close down his collar. There he meets Carole Lombard, the local librarian. They fall in love - at least she does, and they marry; Gable acts like it's a big joke. Of course, he gradually falls in love with her and even decides to turn himself in to the law. He's sentenced to three months in the slammer (he tells her he's going away to South America on business), and when he gets out, our happy couple is reconciled. The script is a good one, and the interplay between Gable and Lombard is lively and romantic. They really make a good pair, and it's a shame it was their only picture together, though they would marry in 1939. Worth a watch.",1149033600,,774,4.308219178082192
677942,4,6303560059,"No Man of Her Own is the story of a glamorous small town girl (Carole Lombard) who longs to break free from her monotonous life as a librarian. She finds her escape when she meets Babe the gambler (Clark Gable) who makes his money by scheming with a few buddies. By the flip of a coin they are married, and they find it hard coping with each other's expectations.

This film is most widely known as the only film to star the famous couple of Lombard and Gable, often thought to be Gable's only real love. The two have great chemistry and are sufficient enough to have garnered further films together; it is strange they did not, especially after their marriage.

This early film utilizes some scandalous images later banned from the screen including Lombard in her underwear and Gable from the waist up in the shower.

The picture is great, and the film makes use of some really beautiful shots, especially those set in the library.

Overall, this is a good, highly entertaining romantic film.",1131926400,2,993,4.625
677943,5,6303560059,"I first came across this film at a local video store that carries hundreds of old classic films that you can't find anywhere else.  Because of the great characters and great acting, it is one of my favorites.  The plot is so unique.  I love how Babe wants to become an ""honest man"" but doesn't want Connie to know.  And even more so that when Connie finds out he had been in jail for 90 days, she doesn't tell Babe that she knows.  She just lets him tell his stories and loves him even more than she did before.

677944,4,6303560059,"Strangely, this little flick is the only one in which both Gable and Lombard appeared in together. Clark Gable was such a blazing new star in 1932 that acquiring him for NO MAN OF HER OWN was considered a major coup. It came about when MGM wanted Fredric March to star with Norma Shearer in SMILIN' THROUGH and in exchange was negotiated. Gable's potent magnetism had a responsive foil in Carole Lombard, he as a crooked gambler on the run from detectives, she as a wise, big city gal, hiding out as a small town librarian who falls for his advances and marries him..........When Gable returns to New York for more ""easy money"", he eventually surrenders to the law because a jealous confederate (Dorothy Mackaill) threatens to expose him. The routine plot caught fire from the Lombard-Gable spark, which also ignited a long (albeit intermittent) off-screen love affair which eventually led to marriage seven years later. Carole Lombard was born Jane Alice Peters in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1908; she was originally a chubby Mack Sennett bathing beauty in silents. Gable was born William Clark Gable in Cadiz, Ohio on February 1, 1901; he got his start in show business doing theatre work in Portland, Oregon, much to the dismay of his stern German dad, who was never terribly impressed with his son's success in the movies; he thought acting was an inept way for a man to make a living.",1005782400,19,1385,4.75103734439834
677945,4,6303560059,"""No Man of Her Own"" was the only film to feature both Clark Gable and Carole Lombard and, while slight, it's a pleasant, feel-good comedy that any Gable or Lombard fan will enjoy. Made four years before the couple became romantically involved, it still showcases their chemistry to great effect. Gable plays Babe Stewart, a cardshark who goes on the lam and meets Connie Randall (Lombard), an innocent small-town girl looking for adventure. They marry on the flip of a coin and return to the city, where Babe proceeds to hide his criminal activities from his wife, for a time...Though nothing spectacular, both Gable and Lombard shine as they deliver the laughs.",991267200,3,662,4.919642857142857
677946,4,6303560059,"This video already has two major league stars to draw attention - the handsome Clark Gable and the gorgeous Carole Lombard, who shared a true life fairy tale romance. The plot of the movie is quite well put together.  Clark Gable plays a ruthless gambler, Babe Stewart, who leaves New York and  goes to small town Glendale to get away from some financial problems where  he meets Connie Randall, played by Carole Lombard, who is the cynical town  librarian. Gable is instantly attracted, but not in love, he marries her on  the flip of a coin and sees her as prosperous to his social activities.  Connie is deeply in love, and does not realise that her husband is only  stringing her along. She does not know his true profession and when she  does find out, she ruins his chances for big money.  Gable's character  finally realises at the end that he does love Connie and he is prepared to  change his ways for her, such as hand himself over to the ever watchful  authorities. Connie goes back to Glendale, she believes her husband is in  South America, she does not know he is trying to change his ways for  her.... I highly recommend this romantic comedy to all classic movie  lovers. The characters were played superbly by Gable and Lombard, whose  chemistry highlighted this movie.

678020,4,6303560059,"This movie is a little gem. The plot is fairly simple and suffice to say it is about love. This would classify as a romantic comedy but it is also quite dramatic. It has the famous ladder scene that brought in a new morals code but it is extremely tame. It is hard to understand why that caused any problem whatsoever since it is quite clear that Gable was not looking up Lombard's skirt, or doing anything sexually invasive. He or his management pushed the envelope the year before in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT when he took off his shirt to reveal his undershirt (another scandalous act!) so it would appear that such incidents were done on purpose to attract publicity for his films. All such tame incidents aside however, this is a really enjoyable film. Gable and Lombard are resolute characters who quickly become romantically involved and almost as quickly break up because of Gable's character's deception. It is an interesting issue that they are fighting over. The other great thing about this movie is the surrounding character roles all played so well. Watch out for Elizabeth Patterson playing Lombard's mother who in only a couple of scenes establishes an amusing and inciteful character looking out for her determined daughter. Grant Mitchell playing Gable's friend and accomplice is another to watch. Definitely enjoyable viewing and the film is restored to perfection.",1458432000,7,1380,4.952586206896552

 As to Gable and Lombard's real life marriage, all I can say is don't believe the hype and studio(MGM)publicity. After reading her biography Screwball: The Life of Carole Lombard, I view their marriage with definite mixed emotions. Gable was a life-long philanderer and didn't change his behavior after his marriage to Lombard. Obviously, I am a Carole Lombard fan, however both Mitch Leisen(director), and Robert Stack(actor) both said, at different times, that Carole was putting a lot into the marriage and not getting much in return. Director Ernst Lubitsch(to Be or Not To Be((Carole's last film)) said that the love affair had died but the marriage lingered on. Gable was quoted as saying ""women marry me, I just go along with the gag"". Gable wanted a 'mother', not a wife. Sadly, Carole was willing at least, to 'mother' him.",1366502400,3,1046,4.909604519774011

678138,4,6303560059,"Paramount Pictures presents ""NO MAN OF HER OWN"" (1932) (82 min/B&W) -- Starring: Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Dorothy Mackaill, Grant Mitchell, George Barbier, Elizabeth Patterson, J. Farrell MacDonald, Tommy Conlon

Directed by Wesley Ruggles

The plot and story line: -- Gable is a gambler/con artist who's forced by circumstance to beat it out of New York and he flees for a small suburb where he meets librarian Carole Lombard and marries her. That's as far as I'm going with the telling of the plot, the rest is up to you!

Gable and Lombard may have gone on individually to greater things, but ""No Man of Her Own"" remains a thoroughly enjoyable piece of fluff, worth watching for more than just the one-off pairing of its stars. Forget all logic and likelihood, ignore the occasional unevenness, and just sit down and enjoy.

It's very interesting to see a younger Clark Gable who even at this stage was well established in his screen presence. And Carole Lombard couldn't be more beautiful! Great viewing for the fans of Gable and Lombard.

* Special Footnote: -- Although Carole Lombard and Clark Gable later became one of Hollywood's most famous couples, they were completely indifferent to one another during the making of this film. It was not until several years later that they met again and fell in love.

** Another Footnote: -- After filming was over Carole Lombard presented Clark Gable with a ham featuring his picture on it.

If that appeals to you, great.  However, it is deceptive to not plainly state so in the product description.  Filmed in color and artificial color added later are two entirely different things.  Those of us who would watch anything from the 30's filmed in Technicolor just for the eye candy appeal could not care less about fake or enhanced B/W films.

678141,4,6303560059,"When NO MAN OF HER OWN was released in 1932, the prudery of the Hays Code prohibiting female flesh and obvious sex was still a year or two away.  Director Wesley Ruggles had no trouble pairing Clark Gable and Carole Lombard as a pair of lovers who saw in each other instant smoke.  Both in real life were married to others, but they eventually married in 1939.  Here, the attraction that they held for each other could not be faked.  Gable is ""Babe"" Stewart, a card scam artist who leads a team in cheating marks of their money.  Gable is successful, partly because he likes to have a pretty blonde to distract his victims.  He begins with Kay Everly (Dorothy Mackail) but she is too much of a clinging vine and he soon dumps her.  On a trip to upstate New York to evade the law, he meets Connie Randall (Lombard) and the sparks fly.  She is bored with her humdrum small town life and sees in Gable the man of her dreams.  She wants him even more than he wants her but fears that if she gives in too soon, he will not respect her in the morning.  They trade witty barbs back and forth until startlingly when he flips a coin to see what their plans for their upcoming date will be, she said,""Tails, we get married.""

Up to this point, NO MAN OF HER OWN is an unclear mix of drama, comedy, and romance.  We do not find out till midpoint that the bulk of the tone is light romantic comedy.  We do not mind the evolving tone mostly because director Ruggles shows a surprising amount of skin for both Gable and Lombard.  Both are seen as semi-nude in the shower, and the camera plays lingeringly over her form as she strips to her undies.  What makes all of this work is that the reality-based tough guy personality of Gable and the sweetly caring Lombard make us care about who they are, what they want, and where they are going. Their love scenes foreshadow their later love life so that when they marry both on film and in real life, we smile and say, ""This is what movies are all about.""",1263081600,4,1986,4.2727272727272725

678143,4,6303560059,"For those of us who weren't around for this era, many see it as a cozy escapist time in America, because of the films made. Even with the very harsh realities of the Depression, Hollywood did a good job in making the 1930s a desired time to live for many. This film captures that spirit especially in the earlier small town scenes of Glendale. When we want to get away from today's challenges in life, ""No Man of Her Own"" is an example of the films that provide that opportunity to go to a ""safer"" place. It also provides the answer that love at first sight is not the only legitimate way to determine when two people are meant to be together. Obviously Gable and Lombard didn't flip over each other in 1932 even being pushed together in the romantic scenes. According to literature, it would be 1936 before this happened. I highly recommend ""No Man of Her Own,"" one of Gable's best and lesser known movies.",1245456000,3,907,4.437125748502994
678144,4,6303560059,"Clark Gable and Carole Lombard were one of the greatest Hollywood couples. Briefly married in 1939 (until Lombard's untimely death in 1942), they only ever starred in one movie together.  NO MAN OF HER OWN was filmed in 1932 when both were married to different people; their relationship started shortly after the filming wrapped.  In the movie we can observe the crackling chemistry which later crossed over into their personal lives.

In NO MAN OF HER OWN, Clark Gable plays Babe Stewart, a professional con man and cardshark who decides to get away from New York to avoid the prying eyes of a vice squad detective.  In the small town of Glendale we meet Connie Randall (Carole Lombard), a librarian simply aching to leave the confines of her tight-knit community.  On the toss of a coin, Connie and Babe get married, but when they return to New York, how will Babe explain his ""profession"" to his new bride?

This is a joyful romantic comedy with lots of sass and sparkle.  Gable and Lombard will have you transfixed from the very moment they meet in the movie.  The reason why they never made another film together was because Gable was contracted with MGM and Lombard spent the bulk of her career at Paramount.  Clark Gable was briefly loaned out to Paramount to participate in NO MAN OF HER OWN (in exchange, Bing Crosby would cross over to MGM to star opposite Marion Davies ""Going Hollywood""); so it was extremely difficult for Gable and Lombard to be reunited in another movie.

The DVD includes an all-new introduction from Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1203724800,11,1612,4.825454545454545

678146,5,6303560059,"No Man Of Her Own stars the great Clark Gable as Babe Stewart, a card shark and a crook cheating innocent people out of their money in ""friendly little card games"" with his buddies. Carol Lombard plays Connie Randall, a small town girl bored silly who marries Babe Stewart on the flip of a coin when he is in her small town to avoid ""the heat"" of the police chasing after him.

Fortunately, the plot gets better! After a somewhat slow start to establish this rather unlikely hasty marriage, Babe Stewart and his new wife Connie finally return to Babe's home town of New York. Eventually Connie gets wise to Babe's card shark ways and then comes ""the"" confrontation.

Of course, you may think I've said it all--but after Connie confronts Babe the plot has a lot of directions in which to travel. Will Babe reform? Will he kick Connie out of his life or give her ""hush money"" to keep her from squealing to the police? Will Connie join Babe and his buddies and become a part of the racket? And what about Babe's former girlfriend, the histrionic Kay Everly (Dorothy Mackaill) who threatens to jump off the balcony of Babe's high rise apartment if Babe doesn't return to her? Will Kay try to ruin Connie's affections for Babe? No spoilers here, folks--you'll have to watch the movie to find out the answers!

The choreography works well in the scenes where Connie is pursued in the library by Babe after they first meet; and the cinematography framed things well within the screen, too.

The DVD only has a brief introduction by Robert Osbourne of Turner Classic Movies; we get no deleted scenes or other special extras. Sorry, folks!

Overall, No Man Of Her Own is a much better film than some people will say. It held my attention very well. We get to see a very young Clark Gable working at his very best with his future wife Carol Lombard; and their onscreen chemistry works to enhance the picture.

I highly recommend this film for fans of pre-code drama; and people who are fans of Carol Lombard and Clark Gable will want to see this one, too.

Although tame by today's standards, the obvious displays of sexual tension between the two characters is something that within a year would be ""history""; Gable in a tee-shirt in the same room with Claudette Colbert in It Happened One Night would be seen as ""scandalous.""
