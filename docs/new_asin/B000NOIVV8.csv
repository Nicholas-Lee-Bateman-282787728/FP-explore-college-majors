2773398,5,B000NOIVV8,"Warning!  Spoilers ahead!

Buying all of this incredible series on DVD is a more confusing undertaking than it ought to be.  Grouping both halves of Season Two into this single package definitely simplifies things somewhat.  The set also comes with a friendlier price than when each half was sold separately.

BATTLESTAR GALACTICA after three seasons has established a critical reputation unprecedented in the history of TV Sci-fi.  A host of mainstream reviewers and publications have named it not merely the best Sci-fi series on TV, but the best series of any genre.  And we are not talking low-profile critics and publications.  At one time or another TV Guide, Ken Tucker, Rolling Stone, the New York Times, Matt Roush, the Chicago Tribune, Maureen Ryan, the San Francisco Chronicle, Entertainment Weekly, and a host of others have praised the show as the best on TV.  It was only one of two shows to make the American Film Institute's list of the Ten Best Shows on TV two years in a row.  To top it all off, in 2006 it won a prestigious Peabody Award.  And all this for a Sci-fi series!

But there has never before been Sci-fi like this.  Normally Sci-fi TV is associated with escapist entertainment, clever perhaps at its best, but never truly challenging.  A few series have previously challenged this, in particular FIREFLY and FARSCAPE, but all other series to some degree kept looking over their shoulders at imagined teen viewers, determined never to get either very dark or very outrageous.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the first Sci-fi series targeted more at intelligent grown ups than young male teens (even if those ""teens"" were in their thirties or forties).  BSG went dark and stayed dark, became grittier and grittier, and had a cast of characters who were sometimes heroic but where more often simply messed up.

Narratively BSG will, in the end, contain more or less a single narrative.  It is best to think of the show, like LOST, as a long novel that contains individual chapters.  Arcs overlap from season to season and year to year.  For instance, in the Miniseries we are introduced to a Cylon sleeper agent known as Lt. Sharon ""Boomer"" Valerii and in the first episode of Season One a Cylon who is identical to her who is another Sharon (usually referred to merely as ""Sharon"" though later as ""Athena"").  Over the course of the three seasons we gradually see these two Cylons basically trade places.  Season One focuses more on Boomer, but in Season Two and Three the focus is almost exclusively on the other Sharon.  But their stories are not contained neatly in this or that season.  Similarly, we learn in Season One that the Cylons believe that Starbuck is ""special,"" that she ""has a destiny.""  In Season Two that is expanded upon a bit, but it comes to full fruition in Season Three.  It is, therefore, a tad meaningless to say something like, ""Season One is the best season of BSG"" or ""No, Season Two (or Three) is!""  All the seasons hang together.  In the end it will be one long story.

While insisting that BSG must be judged as a whole, Season Two is nonetheless remarkable in its own right.  Not that every episode is golden.  In a recent interview BSG creator Ron Moore revealed that over the first three seasons the network had often insisted on stand alone episodes that they hoped would attract new viewers who are otherwise intimidated by the complexity of the overall story.  As a result, the writers were forced each season to insert some episodes that didn't really carry the story forward and were something of a drag on the series as a whole.  The first half of Season Two was not plagued by this problem.  In fact, few of the first ten episodes can truly be considered stand-alone.  ""Final Cut"" and ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" are stand alones, but both of these are utterly remarkably episodes.  But in the second half of the season the series hits something of a dead spot.  ""Black Market"" is widely regarded (even by Ron Moore) as perhaps the weakest episode in the entire series, but it is followed by other episodes that are considered below par, including ""Scar"" and ""Sacrifice.""  Luckily, the stand alone ""Downloaded"" is one of the season highlights and the two-part finale ""Lay Down Your Burdens"" even better.

The first seven episodes of Season Two really continue major events of Season One.  These include the fallout from the attempted assassination of Adama in the Season One finale, what happens after Starbuck arrives on Caprica, her and Helo's meeting members of the resistance movement on Caprica, the determination of Roslin and Lee to lead whoever will follow them to Kobol, what happens to Boomer after everyone realizes she is a Cylon, and the reaction to the arrival of Helo's Sharon and what she does to keep herself alive.  ""Final Cut"" and ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" are stand-alone episodes, but ""Pegasus"" introduces the battlestar of that name and its commander Admiral Cain.  I would, however, caution viewers not to watch the version of ""Pegasus"" that appears on the 2.0 disc, but instead to watch the Extended Version on in the 2.5 set.  It adds a lot to the story.

The second half of Season Two, with the exception of the amazing Pegasus trilogy of episodes, doesn't carry the story forward as much as the previous season and a half had.  No doubt the network's desire for stand-alone episodes played a role here.  There were, however, a number of plot developments, many of them centered on what to do about Sharon's pregnancy (indeed, what to do with Sharon in general).  The latter part of the season deals with Baltar's challenge of Roslin for the presidency in the upcoming election.  But I would hasten to add that even at its weakest, BSG remains riveting entertainment.  I will admit that I usually skip ""Black Market"" and ""Scar"" when I rewatch Season Two, but I don't skip anything else.

I want to close by stating that BSG is actually a series that might be better suited for fans of other quality TV shows more than those viewers who normally watch nothing but Sci-fi.  There is certainly nothing wrong with watching only shows of a particular genre, but my own experience in talking with others, making recommendations to others, getting their feedback, and spending considerable time on various BSG boards that this show appeals more to people who focus less on genre and more on quality.  If your favorite shows of the past decade include such shows as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, THE SOPRANOS, SIX FEET UNDER, THE WEST WING, ANGEL, LOST, THE WIRE, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, THE GILMORE GIRLS, and VERONICA MARS, you are almost certain to love this show.  Not all fans of the Star Trek or Stargate franchises, on the other hand, always do.  This series breaks down and reconstructs what we expect of a Sci-fi series.",1179705600,38,6803,4.764304013663535
2773399,5,B000NOIVV8,"While the shards of humanity are traversing the galaxy in search of Earth, the producers, cast and actors of Battlestar Galactica have brought thought provoking science fiction to this pale blue dot.  The top notch cast of accomplished actors and relative unknowns blend together seamlessly producing stories with a cutting edge, with applicability to today's problems. You see the fledgling president cut her teeth on tough issues, buck up against a distrustful but honorable military leader and the issues it produces.  Starring such A-list actors as Mary McDonnell and Edward James Olmos, they raise the level of play and while there are effects the story and characters are the centerpience.  Even the bad guy cylons (skin jobs, not the toasters) are complex and multi-faceted.  Season Two was terrific, season three unbelievable and I really can't wait to see where these talented, visionaries take us to next year.  Try it out, guaranteed to catch and hold your attention -- and at times, your breath.",1178928000,8,1007,5.153374233128834
2773421,5,B000NOIVV8,"I watched this series on Sci Fi Channel when it first came out - and then watched the reruns (on SyFy). Thrilled to watch it again on Amazon Prime! Undoubtedly the best complete Science Fiction series I have ever seen. Fantastic special effects which still hold up today. Great story line and great  performances by the entire cast. I am a huge fan of Mary McDonnell (also great in Major Crimes) and Edward James Olmos (since Miami Vice). One slight criticism is the inconclusive ending - but all these long series have weak endings (yes, I'm talking to you, ""Lost') which just tells me that good endings a very hard to write. So remember its the journey, not the arrival that counts.
 If you somehow missed it - now's your chance!",1518220800,,731,4.572519083969466

2773423,4,B000NOIVV8,"Really enjoy this show. I do find the OVER use of word ""frak"" extremely annoying. Makes the show seem like an after school special. Makes me wondering how many of these actors just laugh, roll their eye's or can't keep a straight face while saying it.",1516665600,,251,4.478260869565218
2773424,5,B000NOIVV8,"This show is amazing. It's one of the best fracking sci fi series ever made and it's so largely overlooked.

The story is good. The visuals are good. It's immersive in it's reality from the good acting and set design. You really get pulled into the story and feel like it's realistic despite it being about a robot army that kills human spaceships.

Season 2 starts off a little slower than season 1. It gets more into the politics of the government. And the story progresses a lot slower in the first few episodes. It all starts off immediately after the events  that ended season 1. So you don't have any of that ""3 years later, here's how this show is now totally difference"" nonsense you get sometimes.

The whole 'mythology of the gods' element of the series starts playing a bigger role in season 2. It's not all military operations and Cylon killing. They add more of the mysticism of Laura's role in the prophecy.

Things start to really pick up in season to after about Episode 6. Overall the season is a fine part of the franchise.",1516665600,,1041,4.4867724867724865

2773448,5,B000NOIVV8,"I'm re-watching the entire series, and upon a second watch years later, season 2 holds up amazingly well. The season begins with Adama in critical condition and the entire fleet in crisis, as usual. Kara Thrace is back on Caprica. Gaius Baltar is as slippery as ever, doing whatever it takes to stay out of trouble/survive/live the easy life. James Callis really did deserve bigger roles after this one (he was recently spectacular in a short stint on 12 Monkeys). There's a lot that happens in this season - I had honestly forgotten how much this season contains. The Pegasus finds them, throwing the whole democratic system they have in place upside down. They find a new planet, which leads to a big time jump. There are 20 episodes in this season. The second season is wonderfully written, acted, and directed. It's tense almost the entire time. I picked this up on sale randomly for $14.99 a few months back, so if you're interested in the series and are in no rush to watch it, I'd keep checking to see if it goes back on sale.

2773517,4,B000NOIVV8,"This series kinda runs as the polar opposite to Babylon 5 (a prior show by the same creators) in a lot of ways, with the exception of a convoluted, destiny-oriented storyline. It gets a lot too Game-of-Thrones-y where the alliances and backroom deals are concerned sometimes for my tastes. It can be hard to get into at times precisely because of that. Otherwise though the acting is really good in my opinion; James Olmos and Mary McDonnel have to be two of my favorite TV actors of all time. Tricia Helfer really makes her character a lot deeper than her initial oversexed demeanor would suggest. The rest are good enough that the acting sometimes trumps the story line in keeping me into the show.

Beautifully animated, protagonist ships suffer damage, and it stays there to at least some extent. The logistics of a fleet of spacefaring vessels which were never intended for long-term independent operation now finding themselves in exactly such a situation without resupply or dry dock are addressed and indeed major plot points throughout the series.",1480291200,,1056,4.932584269662922

2773708,5,B000NOIVV8,"Really builds on Season 1. BSG continue to tackle epic philosophical questions by breaking them down to an individual, human scale, and the result is addictive. This season really explores the tension between military and civilian models of government, and culminates with an examination of the downfalls of democratic rule - Roslin must choose between what's morally right and what will be best for the people. That probably sounds kinda boring. It's not. It pulls you in and won't let go - you just can't stop watching. The classic up-close and personal, warts and all BSG filming style makes everything seem immediate and urgent. The focus on ongoing character development of Adama, Roslin, Tigh, Apollo, Starbuck, and Baltar, as well as many supporting characters, means the show is always moving forward. Space battles continue to be epic, with brilliant use of CGI shaky-cam that can never quite keep up with the Vipers. It feels so real, it's almost more like news footage than CGI! Definitely one of my all-time favorite shows.",1431216000,2,1035,5.058479532163743
2773709,5,B000NOIVV8,"Hands down one of the best scifi shows to date. Worth watching for so many different reasons. Cant begin to name them, if you aren't sure, ask someone who has watched it in your life, if they don't say ""i couldn't stop watching it once i got started"" they probably didn't watch it and are just lyin to be a troll. literally every kind of person should be able to identify with some part of this show.. its epic as is possible in literally every way. it will make u cry, laugh, want to jump up and say damn, that was close! and at the same time leave you wanting more up till the very end (which it ties off quite nicely)

whatever you do, if you want to enjoy this show to its fullest, plug your ears if anyoen starts to say ""oh did you know? ____ _____ was a cylon yet? lol and unless you want to ruin it, i would just say don't try to guess and ask someone whos seen it or look it up, its way more fun if you find out how the writers and actor(esses) intended it to unfold. as i said. epic

if you can watch the first mini series episode and say it was ok or you like it or are impressed, it gets exponentially better with each episode right to the very end of the show.

enjoy~!

i personally have turned 8 + people on to this show, and every single one of them begged me to show them more lol

my mom and grandma both watched the entire show front to back with me in 2 months almost every day we watched 2-3 episodes, then i did the same with a group of 3 friends my own age. and a few more individually :D

i myself put it on at random and it always brings meaning to my time i normally just play video games etc instead i have this playing and its like a constant companion that never ceases to be awesome in every way :P

This is probably THE best sci-Fi TV series ever. It has all you might want: action, murder, betrayal, love, sex, ambition, politics, hate, racism, intolerance and forgiveness. It is an epic series and should be watched by anyone who is interested in humanity.

The casting is spot on and the acting spectacular. You will love these characters. I first watched the entire series on my laptop right after it had finished airing on TV in 2009.
I was unaware of it during its actual airing. So this was a great find, having been viewing it once or twice a year since and finding new meanings with each watching. It is one of those series you will want to rewatch right after you finish it with your draw dropped.

Amazon prime is a paid service which offers ""free"" streamed content.... except the content becomes not ""free"" sometimes and costs more money in addition to the annual service fee?

Amazon,  I am gravely disappointed solely due to your unannounced removal of shows from the ""free with prime"" offering without notice of any kind.

2773892,5,B000NOIVV8,When I saw the remake of Battlestar Galactica I had the memories of the original show casting heavy doubt on the story being worth the time to watch.  After making it through the first two seasons on Prime Instant Video I can see that I should never judge a show by the quality of a previous one of the same name.  Other than the names being the same in some cases this show carries over nothing from the original and sets itself apart from most shows and takes us to a place far more intriguing than most any do.  I'm not sure what to expect from the remainder of season 3 and 4 but the by the end of 2 and beginning of 3 the story lines that had been set in place went into hyper speed and had more action in 5 episodes than many shows do their entire run.  The writers have no problem pushing the envelope of character development and change as circumstances move so fast it has left my head swimming and my interest peaked as for where they can go from here.  But if the first 2 seasons are any indication then I'll just have to hang on and enjoy the ride hoping the end is not a disappointment after a mind boggling first half.

2773946,4,B000NOIVV8,"I'm a newcomer to BSG previously coming from the world of Star Trek. After after watching literally over 500 episodes of every Trek episode ever made, I wanted something new. I tried out BSG and instantly got hooked.

BSG is a fantastic sci fi series. The characters are all flawed and you just want to keep watching more and more to see the next thing that happens, whether it is relationship drama or another cylon invasion. Season 2 picks up where the first brilliant season left off, introducing us to some new ideas and story lines behind the show revolving around religion, the 13 colonies, and finding the mysterious planet Earth!

As far as season 2 goes, I'll keep it short and simple:

The pros - decent CGI work, gritty sets, deep relationships and character traits, and overall a really entertaining show. Once in a while they also manage to fit in some nice comic relief with Gaius Baltar as well. Also, the cast on this show, it's fantastic. This is a very fine set of actors/actresses. Edward James Olmos single handedly carries the show. Lastly this season introduces us to the Pegasus which was a nice sub-plot.

The cons - as far as season 2 goes, I don't think it was quiet as good as the first season. There were some rather strange episodes to say the least with where writers took things. Like some other reviews said, there was a little too much religious topics as well as the pointless killing off of a certain character. There were also a few very obvious ""filler"" episodes.

I hate to say it, but I don't quiet like BSG as much as Star Trek. But it does comes very close. I think they did the absolutely best they could with this show for it being on a second-rate television network with not quiet as many viewers. I look forward to the rest of the series and am anticipating the new movie coming out (although it will be a new cast).",1397779200,,1862,4.480825958702065

2773948,5,B000NOIVV8,"Took a few episodes to warm up to. However, by end of first season I was hooked! This show is a relentless ride that disbands the cliches of modern science fiction, and replaces it with a dark and gritty adventure that challenges mortal choices and how to cope with them. Add hints of theology and you have one of the best series ever made. I loved absolutely all of it!",1397347200,,370,4.3
2773949,5,B000NOIVV8,"Season 1 had a few ""Miracle Solutions"" that were a bit too pat.

Season 2 has none of that.  It's much better developed.  There are a few filler episodes, but most either forward the story or provide more insight into the characters or the universe/world of the story.

It's been fascinating being able to go through this without interruption.  The story arc is good, continuous.  The characters have depth, undergo believable stresses, and respond believably.

While the action in the series, its not the flassh and dazzle that make the series stand head and shoulders above the other series on the air, it is the character development and the complete arc of the story adn vision which makes this series my favorite.

I could only wish that other writers and producers could take the example of this show and make something worth showing and presenting. This is the only series which has ever caused me to Cry. and I was proud to do so.

2773960,5,B000NOIVV8,"I love this series. Got instantly hooked on it. Really haven't watched TV at all in last 20 years so everything is new to me. Very good plot and sub-plots. Some minor errors such as ash being blown in space (no wind in space). Also, have questions as to where do all their supplies come from? Cigarettes, liquor seem to be in unlimited quantities. No shortage. Also, some of the military appear to get away with almost anything. In real life, they would be relieved of command and/or court martialed. But since this is fiction, it is easy to overlook all this and just enjoy the story and the acting. Some very good performances that make it seem real and not just an actor going thru their lines. Glad I never got into it on TV since the wait from week to week would have been totally frustrating.

I wanted to rewatch from the beginning and it is still a very compelling, very human drama.  The characters are written exceptionally well and the acting is very high quality.  The story lines are still relevant today and I do not see any change in that in the near future.  Great watch for fans of the original series (I am one) and those who have never been exposed before.

I usually don't like SciFi, but I was hooked after I watched the miniseries that kicked off season 1. Season 2 is even better than the first in many ways. Most importantly, Season 2 delves further into the complex relationships between Cylons and humans. It's not just, Good vs Evil, Cylons vs humans. It's more nuanced than that. This is one of the major reasons I like the show. Plus, Edward James Olmos is awesome. Also good acting from most of the supporting cast. Watch. This. Fracking.

Every aspect of human emotion, instinct, selfishness, love and need to survive are portrayed. best of all, the continuing stories are Not Predictable. They full of the unexpected.

This is not a show for children and it was intended for adults. Their are no two dimensional characters here. Each one is laid bare complete with flaws.

This is not the old Battlestar Galactica which was cheesy, hoakie, and sort of a Ben Cartwright(Bonanza) in space. In truth, the name of the show has been its greatest impediment with sci-fi fans. If you have not seen the original series GOOD! DONT! This is completely different and some of the absolute best sci-fi I have ever seen bar NONE!

This is an extremely high quality production. If you are a true sci-fi fan you simply must Must MUST see this show. Start with the 3 hour Battlestar Galactica Mini-Series then proceed to Season 1. This series is a serial so you have to watch each show in sequence or you will get confused and lost.

Galactica is a hunk of junk filled with grit and throw backs to 1970s techno.  There's a black market in cigars and no cure for cancer but that's all part of the charm.  Being a military vessel the drama centers around the flight deck crew, the jet pilot jocks and the chain of command - heavy on the hackers and heroes.  Galactica has no interest in charting the limits of the known universe, its a profoundly lost ship with an enemy on their tail. The enemy, machines created by humans who have adopted human form, provide the combat action as well as infiltration and intrigue.  The undercover ""sleeper agent"" machines that have associates with humans evolve emotions which cloud their judgment and the random variables of jealousy, loyalty, love and trust adds an infinite selection of plot motivations but also acts as reflexive mirror when humans and machines face off.  The series is not just about the war or getting back home, Galactica is about the battle with our nature and the proverbial human journey.  Galactica ferries a convoy of civilians vessels with a government and governance issues that involve judgment calls and judgment questions that make the series addictive.  Pretty stellar acting too, even with the occasional character leap necessitated by plot twist, the actors never break stride.

2773989,5,B000NOIVV8,"An epic sci-fi show that explores the limits and faults of humanity. A great update on the original, dealing with the human genicide at Cylon hands more realistically.",1391040000,,167,5.0
2773990,5,B000NOIVV8,"I was skeptical about a sci-fi tv series, but I had heard good things about Battlestar Galactica so I gave it a try.  Wow, I was so impressed.  This is a legitimately good series.  The cast and story lines are excellent.  I am totally addicted.  I highly recommend this show to anyone.  Even if you don't like sci-fi, it is a great show.",1391040000,,337,4.26984126984127

2773993,4,B000NOIVV8,"Battlestar Galactica is, in my opinion, one of the best science fiction shows out there.  Sure, the premise is nothing exciting (man-made machines became so advanced that they tried to annihilate all humans).  However, the show is about the human race's search for a home in the vast, dark, and lonely universe. The show did a great job highlighting and dissecting human nature.  Though it is in the fantasy genre, this show is insightful and very realistic in the way humans are portrayed.",1390435200,,490,4.879518072289157

2773998,5,B000NOIVV8,This is a good series. It does have some interesting religious overtones meets sci-fi. There are moments of predictable mixed with some twists. There are name brand actors who do good work.,1390176000,,189,4.9375

2774000,5,B000NOIVV8,I was definitely not a fan of the original series which I thought was hokey. So I was skeptical when this series debuted but gave it a try. I was actually shocked at how good it was and thought it was the best TV sci-fi series made to that date. It still holds up and is still one of the best ever made.,1390176000,,303,3.8253968253968256

Great music,
Great stories,
Great characters, that we love but hate at the same time - perfect definition of love by BSG.
A post-apocalyptic universe that transcends the SF and shows more about human interactions than special effects.
This second season does not suffer from the too long scenes of the first one, even if each episode should be watched as a real movie, which means that the narration is totally developed. And this, this is definitely the strength of BSG compared to other series.",1381708800,,513,4.908045977011494

2774064,5,B000NOIVV8,"Thanks to Amazon Prime's trial period, I discovered this GREAT series.  It's more compelling and interesting in every show, than most one-time new sci-fi movie that hits the screen.  Glad I discovered it. So many twists and turns, it always keeps you guessing.

2774082,1,B000NOIVV8,"Season 2 is as complicated and motivating as an epic, or reality, for that matter. The irony of an inhuman race of dark angels telling humanity that they're not fit to survive, at the same time helping them to do just that, is priceless. And the intrigue within the human community is an interesting mix of West Wing and Wise Guy, with the usual sci-fi pseudo techspeak thrown in. Almost makes me glad I was too busy to see this series when it came out.

Sorry, but I've had to downgrade my review. Since amazon changed it's web page format for instant videos, no computer I use can now play Amazon instant videos. Not my nook, not Linux Mint, not RedHat Linux, not CentOS, not Debian. At this rate I will never again renew my prime membership. So the content of the video may be good, but as a video that I can no longer play, it sucks.",1379548800,,837,4.2974683544303796

The only bad part about it is it had to end.",1378512000,,343,4.548387096774194

I like the similarities with the original, and the differences, but it does take getting used to if you remember the original.  However, this series stands on it's own, and is an enjoyable retelling of the original. This one is definitely darker and probably more realistic of the way things might be if our technology was advanced a few hundred years and we were attacked by machines of our own creating.",1378252800,,577,4.4245283018867925
2774135,5,B000NOIVV8,I can't believe I did not watch this series when it started.  I was addicted after episode 2 of Season 1.  My life was consumed with this show and wanting to know what will happen next.  Every episode was a thriller.  Def a must-watch.,1378252800,,235,4.2727272727272725

Olmos is still pretty wooden in most scenes, and his leadership as the Ship's Captain falls short.  Katee Sackhoff in the role of Starbuck is surprisingly credible, if a bit too petulant, and she has won me over as one tough bitch! If you don't hate Col Saul Tigh by the second or third episode, there is no hope for you.  OK, I'm hooked!",1377907200,,495,4.477777777777778

2774141,5,B000NOIVV8,"What happens when humanity is almost destroyed?  How do people carry on?  This show is not just for scifi fans.  It is also an engrossing, multilayered drama.",1377734400,,158,4.777777777777778
2774142,5,B000NOIVV8,"I don't own a TV.  I watch older shows on my PC while I work out. I like to watch shows that are at least 45 minutes long so I can get a good work out. I looked up ""best TV series of all times"" on Google and this one appeared.  I was skeptical. But I am totally hooked.

It's not your typical science fiction show  -  all flash, special effects and loud explosions. This is much more about the relationships between people.  It's about our relationship to the rest of the world. What makes us human and where do we draw that line between human and non-human? The show explores our definition of humanity. What is leadership. Who should we trust.  What does trust mean?  What does love mean? How did we get here?  Where is here? And mostly, why are we always at war?  What is the purpose of war?  Why are humans so cruel? Finally, are we doomed to repeat the same mistakes again and again into infinity?

The references to God wear thin at times because I am an atheist but the exploration of monotheism vs polytheism is interesting. That a belief in God or Gods motivates so much cruelty and that in the name of God or Gods we start wars isn't anything new.  Science fiction has been exploring these themes for years.  But this show is special.

I can't wait to see how it ends... Actually, I wish it wouldn't end.  It's that good.",1377734400,,1331,4.264

2774150,5,B000NOIVV8,"Okay, I was skeptical after being a big fan of the original series and knowing how Universal treated the original Apollo when he tried to revive it.  However, after watching the new series, the producers have done a fantastic job of recreating the whole thing while keeping true to the original series.  They have basically rebuilt the concept with storied theme paralleling human themes/issues/etc.

Although there are some ""reaches"" and ambiguities, I really liked how it was developed and how the spotlight was shared across the board with the characters.  No one dominated, it was shared experiences and importance.  If anything, I think the role of Starbuck was overplayed and they may have done this to really justify the gender change, but overall, I think you can't really complain.  The characters Apollo, Boomer/Sharon, Adama, Starbuck, Baltar, Roslyn, and the ""sixes"" were developed and played out very well.

I only wish there was a developing story to continue the series, but sadly that should not be done since it is over - watch season 3 and 4 and you'll realize that sad fact.

Unfortunately, Caprica did not develop strongly and so the imagination still lingers about the before.  Maybe there could be a short series that starts just before the Cylon war and up to the point of the ""attack"".  One can only hope.",1376784000,,1329,4.9192825112107625

""Strange contradiction I know.

It has very intelligent moments, with a few really dumb ones, but ultimately the premise of utterly menacing, devastating relentless robot bastards intent on killing all humanity under the pretext of ""God's Will"" is not unlike our current world, and very entertaining when you replace ""mad religious zealots"" with ""hyper-violent intelligent robots with souls"".

2774292,5,B000NOIVV8,Great SciFi drama. Each episode has you wanting to watch the next. We watched the whole miniseries in just two weeks.,1365897600,,117,4.619047619047619

2774327,5,B000NOIVV8,Great series! Characters; storyline; acting; and production quality all show continued improvement over season one.

2774328,3,B000NOIVV8,"I got hooked by season 1 and kept staying up late to watch just one more episode.  Season 2 doesn't have the same draw for me.  The deep, complex relationship building of season 1 has been replaced with superficial cardboard characters.  I am disappointed that the writers felt the need to kill off one of the characters with some morals so that his love interest could jump into bed with someone else at the start of the next episode.  Are the writers nothing but a bunch of pubescent adolescents that only think about sex all day long?",1365465600,,537,4.505154639175258

I know I will get slammed for this, but I don't care. I'm a woman first and foremost, and above all is. This show speaks to so much.",1364688000,,465,4.4186046511627906

2774351,2,B000NOIVV8,"I don't care for this version of BG. First, Boomer and Starbuck are women they should have made them men. Don't get me wrong their should be women fighter pilots but because they were 2 of the main characters practically every episode was about sexual intrigue, jealousy, and who's sleeping with who this week. Secondly, they use bullets instead of lasers. My guess is the producers did this to save money on special effects. Third, the society of this advanced culture still has people smoking and alcoholics and they haven't even cured cancer. A society enlightend and advanced as this(at least 100-200 years or more advanced than earth) would have cured the addiction of smoking and acoholism and/or outlawed it. Almost every actor was a drinker, smoker or both. I suspect tobacco companies and alcohol beverage companies paid the actors and probably the producers under the table to smoke in the series. They also would have cured cancer and almost every other disease. It looks like they were practicing 1940's medicine.",1363651200,,1025,5.0

2774366,5,B000NOIVV8,I was hooked on the first episode of season 1. I love the characters. Even the music is great. Have you noticed the sounds of the ship and the size of the doors between rooms? Just what one would expect if one were on an actual spaceship. The most annoying thing though is the voice of Gaius Baltor. Makes my throat hurt listening to him.,1363219200,,338,4.2153846153846155

2774371,4,B000NOIVV8,"Started watching this show a few months ago and was very impressed. Great cast, good action and believable story lines. The whole Baltar seeing the imaginary ghost of the girfriend robot has been annoying and the worst part of this and season 1. Kind of sick of it that but it looks to be claming down some.

Tricia Helfer is particularly amazing in her role as an angel to Guyus Baltar, Park does a tremendous job in her multiple roles...oh yea, the male cast members are pretty good.  This show took the BSG concept way beyond it's origins to a full blown series.",1361145600,,470,4.430232558139535

However, unlike the Star Trek format of individual episodes that are loosely related together, Battlestar Galactica is a continuos plot and consists of many two part episodes that make you watch the second before leaving to do something else.

This is because Amazon collates all of their Battlestar season 2 dvd reviews into one list.  If you purchase the DVD version of season 2, it is split up into 2.0 (the first half) and 2.5 (the second half).  The Blu-ray version comes with the entire season.

2774448,3,B000NOIVV8,"I love the series.  Have watched the dvds many times.  I purchased a blu ray player and wanted the series to start my library.

Many Blu Rays have the problem that you cannot stop an episode and then play/resume.  The disc will restart at the disc menu.  This is incredibly trying for a series where episode content is 5 hours.  Other problem seems to be specific of Universal Studios, they have their own screen saver that comes on  and then the disc will not accept any functions, you have to turn off/on and start over.  The problem seems to be the BR-Java discs which are being used more often to accomodate all those extra menus and special features.  For the added cost of equipment and discs, this should not be an issue.  Same problem on Sony and Panasonic players, haven't tried it on an Oppo player yet.

The series Blu Ray image transfer is great, a bit grainy, but that was the effect the series wanted.  Darker night/space/dark inside ship scenes are more grainy.  Season 2 and season 4 come with all episodes, not half seasons.

I am happy, OTHER THAN the issue that seems to plague most blu rays.",1356912000,,1111,4.49

I'm completely satisfied.

Not Amazon's fault that the Sci-Fi channel broke out the DVD releases the way they did, and like I said, if I were looking to buy it now, I'd probably just buy the complete series in one set.  However, I don't have any regrets for having bought this when I did.",1355356800,,463,4.3882352941176475
2774450,5,B000NOIVV8,"It's gritty, raw, and sometimes shocking.  The writers picked up bits and pieces from the original series, but added a lot of new work to make it fresh.  It is no longer a campy family show, it's a full on evening sci-fi adult drama.  You're never quite sure where it will go next, but it may actually be too intense for many.

2774464,5,B000NOIVV8,"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'
and 'Breaking Bad'.

Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,
not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like a
great novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.

Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich' world of the cop
show to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'Battlestar
Galactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robot
wars the same way.

This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,
or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to be
a human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,
fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recent
politics and real world situations.

My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we tore
through 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.

The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members are
remarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity and
contradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters to
change and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seemingly
inexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -
but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they've
taken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,
even if they're not really why you watch this show.

It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've ever
seen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out and
blown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad to
finish a great book.

I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generally
the blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.
However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problem
and I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there was
a slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhaps
it was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefully
it seemed more a reproduction problem.

This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but accept
as an artistic decision.

Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy
(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might want
to make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the best
you can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the later
discs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too late
to ask for an exchange.

None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode the
occasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wife
never noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).

As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray, it looks as though
you can do better buying the box set, although prices fluctuate
quickly here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'd advise you do the math
and figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.

Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray box
set for about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extras
as the US box set.  Well worth considering as long as the price holds up.",1320796800,,3361,4.515650741350906

2774466,5,B000NOIVV8,"I haven't watched this blu-ray yet, but I have season 1 and it looks fantastic. I mainly wanted to get a review out there for season 2; the ""full"" season 2: beware the boxes that say 2.0, 2.5. they are the first & 2nd semester of season 2, sold separately. As long as you know this, and you don't mind the separate boxes, fine; be sure you don't pay more by buying individually.

Ok: The rebooted Battlestar Galactica is nothing short of brilliant! Top notch writing, directing & effects, populated with Oscar winning and/or Oscar-worthy actors. As science fiction it puts to shame it's competition, but in the universe of television in general it's one of the best series ever produced!

That said: Season 2 is the best of the best! The mythology established in season 1 bares fruit. The episodes in particular to be sure are included in any packaging version are three interwoven episodes, that are like a little miniseries within the series: 'Pegasus', and 'Resurrection Ship' parts 1&2. I wish I could tell you to skip ahead and watch these episodes first, to see what you are working towards, but that would be anticlimactic. You have to get to know the characters and all of the complexities involved to get the full effect of what's happening. I can describe what you need to know but I won't...

Take your holiday cash and buy seasons 1&2; be sure it's the 'newer' Battlestar rebooted series: Starbuck is a woman; Lorne Greene is nowhere to be found; Richard Hatch IS in this series as an adversarial character and he does a great job!  You'll be blown away!",1294012800,5,1566,4.64259927797834

2774468,5,B000NOIVV8,"If you are a science fiction fan and demand a story line that makes sense, then you have found the right movie series.....",1279497600,,122,4.3478260869565215
2774469,4,B000NOIVV8,"I had no idea that this season of televisions most epicly grand series was on bluray. I gaped at how cheap it was and didn't hesitate from buying it at once. Day by day, I waited until my dreams had arrived on my doorstep, waiting to be unwraped. My longing claws dashed at it,hungrily uncovering what it was searching for....and there it was: Season 2 of battlestar Galactica on Blu-Ray!!!

First off, the packaging. It comes in a box with an opening case inside, just like any other tv boxcase, with 5 dvds inside. What i like about it is that each disc doesnt have its own tab that you can flip through. Some tv boxcases have this and it just makes the case much more bulkier, hence taking up more room. How this boxcase is set up is each dvd is piled on top of the other but in a different position so as to allow the view of all 5 dvds. It opens up into three tabs, with an episode and disc guide behind the last two tabs. It is embelished with the faces of the main characters as the back ground for each tab, 2 per tab to be exact.

As for the series itself, lets begin with how awesome this show is. It is, too date, , my favorite sci-fi series. It combines that very nature with harcore drama, something that is hard to pull off without sounding corny. The effects are phenominal, especially in episodes like ""Resurrection Ship Part 2"" where two balltestars have an all out brawl with the cylons in a beautifully choreographed action sequence, or "" valley of Darkness"" where...well i'd have to go into full spoilers but just know that even God himself would have gaped at the angelic creations that this episode evinces. As for the episodes themselves, words cannot express how masterfull they are, except for "" Black Market"" which was just horrible, totally unneccessary and not in tone with the series as a whole, but its just a small price one has to pay for 19 other awesome episodes. Season one did a great job establishing the tone for this dark epic series, and season 2 just builds onto that with some great performaces by the whole cast. It also delves into contraversial topics such as abortion which is dealt quiet well. Some standout episodes are ""Pegasus"" (The last 3 minutes will have you onm the edge of your seat!) and the season finale "" Lay Down Your Burdens Part 2"" which ends on a cliffhanger that will give everyone nerdgasms! Michele Forbs does a guest appearance on a couple of episodes and she is fantastic. She commands the screen with such authority and vigor that its as if she has been on the show for years.

Now, every review must have its criticism. First off, why wasn't the television special ""Battlestar Galactica Razor"" not including? It would make sense to have it in there because it is set in that time frame. I, being a huge geek, already have that dvd but for those new to the series will miss out on it. Moreover, the special features have much to be desired. Each disk has deleted scenes with commentaries. the last disc has some video blogs, more podcasts which are the commentaries, a quiz that tells you which character fits you best, and some other small insignificant stuff. Also, regular version of this boxset has the exact same features. Why couldn't there be a detailed behind the scenes at least, or some gag reel for that matter? The podcasts are insightful and all but you could download those of the website. The special features is definately the weakest part of the whole package, but that should not deter anyone from perchasing this immaculate series because its the content of the episodes that should instigate someone to buy this in the first place.

All in all, besides that one horrid episode and weak special features, there isn't much I could ask for excpet the Blu-Ray version of season 3! Tangent aside, this remarkable series transcends all others with its visual style, performances, and intriguing characters. I highly recommend this remarkable work of art, so buy it now!",1275609600,10,3952,4.569816643159379

Although I approached with much skepticism, but after just the first episode I was hooked and I can tell you, this is the first TV series that I watch with Zeal, enthusiasm and utter respect. Forget Lost, Forget 24, Forget everything else you have seen, if you want to understand humans, humanity, love , sacrifice, perseverance, martyrdom, human flaws and love of God, PLS watch BSG!!  It is simply a masterpiece! It has no Aliens, or weird funny creatures. just pure unadulterated adult story telling, An Allegory I might add. Watching the episodes makes you think, reflect and ponder.  This is good TV, this is good story telling. This is what a series should do.  So pls go out to your nearest Video store and rent Season one, then two, then three and finally four and open yourself into another world, a world never before seen and maybe never again repeated and a truly unforgettable experience!....So say we all!!",1270857600,,1048,4.747252747252747

2774485,5,B000NOIVV8,"Most people would be slightly weary of the idea of a new and re-invigorated version of the spectacle Science Fiction Drama series Battlestar Galactica (1978-1980) being up to the year in which the series became 'Galactica 1980', which lead to its thoroughly trashed downfall, was a bit of a surprise that a network had decided to re-fashion the show with a more updated and far more interesting story. Many fans would, should insist that this is a re-imagining not an intrinsic remake of a cheesy lovable, and to use a pun for a modern show, ""That 70's Show"". Many of the sci-fi fan-boys, and girls, were in need of a successful sci-fi drama series that had the ability to keep fresh interest and action with drama to top.

The show comes from that concept of a 2003 mini-series, a somewhat thorough and enjoyable close to 3 hr pilot. The principal point, machines are made by man, evolved, rebelled, and a war began.

Sci-fi rubbed off on this show, and it pays to respect it with homage's. With elements from novelist Philip K. Dick from his earlier works of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" now known as the film adaptation ""Blade Runner"" along with the dark twisted parallel of the humanoid Cylons, and that mirrored `skinjob' reference. It also manages to match the dark allegory of P. K Dick' ""Valis"" a unique exploration of plethora's and universal metaphysics.

The virtuous and glamoured imagery bears the likeness of Kubrick' ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with cross-cut scenes of Baseships in the sunlight of a nearby star, with a score to match. The score itself is very cinematic, in that it mixes and mingles with the imagery of the show to great exertion; continuously trying new techniques and new ways to give the eye candy. The score feels very dark, operatic and at the same time very tautly tense; it again has mirrored Vangelis' score in ""Blade Runner"" with the deep drum sound to hard hitting acoustics.

Battlestar Galactica is the best character drama that has the real dexterity of raw emotion; the acting shapes plot and vice versa. The characters are flawed and they should be, the situation creates the drama and evidently shapes the characters actions. It perhaps is the only show to bludgeon the scene with taut and well crafted dialogue and sharpest whit, measured writing that current shows like LOST and Heroes could benefit from. The dialogued scenes are spot on quality, the actors all themselves have unique range; perhaps currently the best acting troupe on TV. They have unique ability to play different parts of their personas during the course of a single episode, and still bring a sense of morality, logic and whit to the role; very much unlike a ""space opera"".

The acting troupe has characters including Edward James Almos' brilliant depiction of Commander/Admiral Adama; easily being a favourite. His slightly depressed attitude yet experience make him capable, if not slightly down heartened. His display as a commander of the pride of the fleet does show why he is the best person to have control of a superior vessel. He is quick to think, act and knowing what the cost is with the troubles of his confounded life. Two other characters change form and gender, the two now female, where the Galactica predecessor had two male characters, (when fans should not complain) Katee Sackhoff as Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace, is born into the role of a hard-headed female Viper pilot. As well as the other female candidate played by Grace Park nicknamed 'Boomer'.

One thing this show does well is giving the most unexpected outcome possible, real credit to the writers that show they have a lot of grenades to go certain ways and that their bold spontaneity will either be accepted or judge by audiences. The writers of this show are very clever, in that you might think they plan out the show years in advance a la ""Babylon 5"" or ""Lost"" however you could not be more wrong. The show is written by boldly engaging the big issues currently on TV. You wonder how does a rag-tag fleet survive in the most logical and pragmatic way, scripted to show you that the real evidence of this is present in stories inspired by recent history and current events.

Truth is that many aspects of futuristic life may well be reflected on the current stand stead of today's socio-political and ethical conflict, that's if we decide to create robots that want to kill us. The themes themselves also reflect the big issues: drama, love, personal betrayal, post-9/11 parables, death, rape, murder, greed, religious extremism, depravity and also the antonyms when the situation lightens up (there is humour). In addition, unremittingly keeps putting forth the notion of what is exactly human. It's about genocide, war and the abyss after the precipice.

The special effects are not the only thing that shows high production value, it would put some of the current Trek franchise to shame. Everything is luscious, from the pure spot-on script and unexpected plots to the character actions and the big explosions going on outside.

The imagery splits from sporadic to perpetual, the effects are full of ardour CGI and digital FX, 'in the mind of the pilot/documentary' shot sequences. The new breed of improved and scary Terminator influenced Cylon centurions and human-looking Cylon infiltrators who's brutal degradation towards mankind reflects the worst parts of humanity. Is it pure hate, spite, jealousy or maybe because they have found a god to kill for; sound familiar? Moreover, what you have been waiting for, yes it does have graphic scenes of a sexual nature, but it's not for everyone.

The World is over. The Fight has just begun. 10/10.",1216166400,,5670,4.883575883575884

2774507,5,B000NOIVV8,"Like many of you who bought this series of Battlestar Galactica, I am an avid fan who grew up in the era when the original series came out in 1980's. I must say that although the original series was good, I reckon that the new series is much better. (I'm sure there are people who will disagree). Season 2 and 2.5 have successfully expanded the plot of the story from season 1 and I have found it hard to stop watching the following episode after finishing the first one. Good job on producing this series. I highly recommend it to any sci fi fan and am eagerly waiting for season 3 to be released.",1197590400,,598,4.254385964912281
2774508,4,B000NOIVV8,"I have fallen in love with this series over night and I feel that it really reached it's peak in season 2 (not to say that seasons 1 and 3 weren't awesome as well).  It's a series that even people who don't normally watch sci-fi shows would love because it is more driven by character interaction than technobabble.  Although, as a person who loves sci-fi, I can't say that technobabble is a bad thing, this show does well without it.  Most of the issues it tackles are related to current events or issues, and a lot of people would be able to relate to it, as presents both sides to any arguement completely even to the point of surprising me with the outcome sometimes (see season 3 finale).  The only complaint I have about this season is whose dumb idea was it to split it in half.  I hate having to pay more for the same number of episodes just because it comes with two pretty boxes.  I can only hope they don't pull that stunt with season 3, because if they do, I will be checking ebay for it.  For me that is worth a one star deduction on my review.  The show is excellent, the sale of the show is terrible.",1196985600,,1115,4.2018779342723

Its adherence -- most of the time -- to something very close to ""hard"" or realistic science fiction rules, its emotional depth, and its attention to detail make it one of the best TV sci-fi shows ever.

That said, a list price of $70 (less on Amazon, admittedly) for a single season is out of line.  Trying to disguise this by splitting the season into two boxes simply adds to the sense of being taken advantage of by the bean counters.  If you can't pick it up used somewhere, maybe this price is worth it; I can't say good enough things about the show and this season....",1192924800,,677,4.349206349206349

2774526,4,B000NOIVV8,"Careful when you open this, or you'll immediately lose a couple of days to a Battlestar Galactica marathon. I'm a moderate sci fi fan, more into foreign movies, and I don't like soaps at all. So why is this sci fi soap opera so addictive? For me it's not the gung ho military tone, which isn't my thing. Or even the fact that the cylons are a mix of scruffy men and ridiculously bodacious women--that's sort of an embarassment. What, are women not subject to being seduced by sexy spies? It's all very oriented to adolescent boys, this mix of guns and soft-core guy-oriented porn. I was one of those boys--30 years ago--and it wasn't pretty.

I think what I like most about Galactica is that the humans are hopelessly outgunned and almost deserve to go extinct, they're so foolish and small minded. And throughout the show they inch closer to losing it. There's some honesty here that rarely sneaks out of Hollywood. I mean, what's at stake when a daytime soap character screws up? They land in the hospital? Here you've got nukes going off.

The other thing I really like about this show is Olmos. He was wonderful in Bladerunner (another great piece of dark, existential sci fi to which Galactica owes much of it's style), and he's wonderful here. Gnarly, dogged, getting the short end of the stick, staying the course. A perfect anchor for the rolling catastrophe that the humans face in a nasty cylon universe.

So set aside a ridiculous number of hours, and keep some aspirin handy unless you manage to fast forward through all the ""Previously on Battlestar Galactica"" sequences with that electronic music that goes straight to a spot between your eyes. And enjoy.",1191801600,2,1669,4.708904109589041

2774543,5,B000NOIVV8,"On my review on Battlestar Galactica season 1 I said it was the most engaging show on television. For Season 2 i want to focus on 2 reasons why its the most engaging.

  Jamie Bamber- My favorite character on BG is Cpt. Lee Adama (potrayed by British Actor Jamie Bamber). Now I have never seen any other work with this fine actor so how could i possibly be such a huge fan of his? If you were ever in a relationship when your father was an important figure you will instantly understand his dilemna. A son that tried hard to become more than his father's shadow is a time old situation and one that has been thoroughly debated over the course of time. Lee Adama not only personfies this but puts you in his very shoes. He potrays this role to perfection, he is so convincing you wonder how he finds the motivation to pull off his lines with such poetic justice. He brings a side to this show that makes you believe, even though it is a sci fi show, it resonates the very struggle between human life and conflicts, he is a major reason to watch this show.

  Katie Sackoff- the remake of BG caught much flack at first because of loud mouth, wise cracking Starbuck is portrayed as a female character instead of a male lead. The only role i saw her play before this was the eager college girl she played in haloween resurrection.  Katie took the role of loud mouth, cigar toting Starbuck and made it as it was hers to begin with. She brings such a humanizing effect to this role that it simply outshines most other actors not only in this show, but any show on TV. You find yourself laughing at Starbuck when she brutally mentally distresses young pilots fighting for a spot in the fleet, or when she falls in love with a leader of the resistance movement on Caprica, to when she realizes her true love is someone she is too scared to explore fully. Her character is dynamic but also resonates so much truth in all of us, male or female you can relate to her struggles. She is a heroine for the new age.

  This show continues to amaze me in so many ways.  Battlestar Galactica is a show that only has a few seasons left if not 1 more being Season 4.  Will the fleet eventually find earth, will the relationshsips come to the ending you desire. Will these two (out of many) dynamic characters ever find true peace within themselves. If you never gave BG a second thought until now let me make this very clear. This is without a shadow of a doubt the best show currently on network television.",1189209600,3,2489,4.329032258064516

2774546,5,B000NOIVV8,"I started watching Battlestar Galactica last year in snippets as I channel surfed during commercial breaks or boring sequences on other programs.  After the third or 4th time, I stuck with the program to the end.  Shortly thereafter I added it to my DVR scheduled recordings.  When I saw the earlier seasons were available on DVD, I ordered seasons 1, 2 and 2.5.  The mini-series ""movie"" (on season 1 DVD knocked my socks off and I've been savoring the episodes ever since.

The first season DVD came without ads or trailers.  Season 2.0 is chocked full of ads.  I'm a purist and prefer my purchased entertainment come sans extra crud.  If you want me to watch commercials, reduce the price.  Still, I realize that most people couldn't care less, so have given the series the full 5 stars for it's innovative style, engrossing plot, spectacular special effects and solid performances.  This is what science fiction should be like...

The characters have real depth, with interesting personalities and inter- relationships. There is no black and white, ultimate good versus evil here. Rather,characters on both sides exhibit very real life tendencies for each.
The story line is riveting and has been aimed at an adult rather than adolescent audience - without the moralising that tends to go with other TV shows of this genre.

2774548,5,B000NOIVV8,"When you get this blown away by what was just the mini-series (which I consider a full-sized feature film and which could well have stood on its own, without the show following up !!!), you can't believe they'll be able to hold up the intensity of that first season: sci-fi and human drama interwoven in a masterpiece of a show unheard off (and there are many, many good shows out there... lucky us).
But they manage to get our full attention up. They do it by shifting to a little different angles, focusing more on the characters than the big turns in the story, making episodes into little stories inside the big story (""Scar"" is a really marvellous example...)
And having Kara/Starbuck(played by overwhelming Katee Sackhoff) moved even more into the center of attention is just fine with me. Not that there is any actor on the show who is anything less than perfect...

You enjoyed the first season? Zero risk you'll be disappointed by the second, guaranteed. I watched more than half of it in three days, my evenings seeming way too short!
