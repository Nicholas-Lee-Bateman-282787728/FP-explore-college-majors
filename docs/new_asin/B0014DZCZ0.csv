I've seen previews of this movie from other DVD's and I thought this maybe interesting to watch.  Before purchasing this DVD, I read the Product Description (synopsis) about this movie.  I don't where they got that information (something about a parasite bug) because THAT'S NOT what this movie is about at all!

The movie starts out as a young cute college girl being chased by a young man (in his 20's) in a city park.  He catches her, rips her clothes off and begins raping her.  An older gentleman (late 30's), who happens to be walking by, hears the young girl screaming.  He gets a rock and clobbers the younger man in the head.  The girl thinks she is rescued, but the older man has different plans.  He takes over in raping the young girl.  He makes the girl deep throat him for a while before using a small kids baseball bat to penetrate her.  The younger man returns and hits the man in the head with a rock, knocking him unconscious.  The younger man takes over by tying the girl to a park bench and began raping her.  This goes on a few more times, eventually each man successfully plants their seeds in her.

The reason why I gave this movie 3 stars instead of 5 is because the rape scenes were repeated over and over with no new scenery.  It was becoming boring.  Also, I wish they made this movie in English.  I'm tired of reading subtitles.  The movie is 30 minutes long.",1341619200,3,1495,4.316546762589928
