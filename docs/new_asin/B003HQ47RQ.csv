8397174,3,B003HQ47RQ,Since I couldn't figure out how to return this item I will write a review.  I like the information and enjoy the movements but the writing is off center on the DVD and I don't get to read all of the words.  It's a little frustrating.,1381104000,,233,4.043478260869565
8397175,5,B003HQ47RQ,"Does exactly what I want, it is fairly easy to follow and I can learn it at my own pace",1380758400,,87,3.4
8397176,4,B003HQ47RQ,"hmmm, pretty much this is the same as the Shiba Shi (18 posture) Taiji  Qigong that is world famous.
Although this is nicely done, I don't understand why it is the same qigong movements in the same order as the much more famous 18 posture Taiji Qigong.",1370822400,2,252,4.361702127659575
8397177,4,B003HQ47RQ,Keiko Murakumo's qigon movement is a little bit faster than other popular instructors. I like the speed of her movement and I can easily follow her just by watching Full Session Facing Mirror. I also like the music of Full Session No1~No14. But I wish I could have another Full Session with voice explanation.,1329868800,,309,4.7407407407407405
8397178,5,B003HQ47RQ,"This DVD and book (it's not necessary to get them both, but I prefer being able to read something on paper before watching the DVD) are all you need to tone up your body and start living a healthy lifestyle.
Qi Gong is simple and unlike martial arts, pilates or yoga can be learnt following a DVD/book in your own living room or garden, without an instructor, trainer, equipment of any kind or special clothing/shoes etc.
The DVD shows all the movements in slow motion with detailed instructions that anyone can follow. Or if you prefer, the book contains everything you need to get going on the path to good health and spiritual well-being.",1289692800,3,641,4.631578947368421
