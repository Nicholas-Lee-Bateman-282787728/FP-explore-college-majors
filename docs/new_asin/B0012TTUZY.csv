I'd recommend it to anyone with young children!",1227916800,,271,4.037037037037037

8247769,3,B0012TTUZY,"Well, its a good workout but not for kids older than 8.  I got it for my 10 yr old son to get some extra exercise in between hockey and this was too goofy for him.  I gave it to my daughters daycare class (4yr olds) and I am sure it would suit them much better.  Aside from that the workout was good - Tony is always good for a workout.",1447286400,,336,3.704225352112676

8247771,5,B0012TTUZY,"Great workout video for kids. Lots of pretending (pretend your swimming, etc.) As an adult doing it with them your not going to get much of a work out but it will get your kids moving, which is the point.",1421280000,,204,4.125

8247773,5,B0012TTUZY,"I have three children ages 5, 9 and 12 and they all love this exercise video.  My 5 year old doesn't always follow along perfectly, but he stays pretty engaged throughout.  Tony is just silly enough to keep the kids interested, but not over the top silly.  He includes many moves from his P90X workouts, but presents them in a fun way for the kids.  I often do the workout with my children and I actually get a decent workout because it includes real moves that actually help strengthen the body.  I would highly recommend this video!",1353024000,,534,4.463917525773196
8247774,5,B0012TTUZY,"If you are looking for a way to introduce your kids to a fit lifestyle, this is a great way to do it. My kids love doing these workouts along with me. Way overpriced by sellers here. Buy it direct from Beachbody.com for $9.95 and part  of the price goes to help fund an orphanage.",1294444800,14,280,4.090909090909091
8247775,5,B0012TTUZY,"I'm P90X and P90X+ fan. When I learned about Tony and the kids DVD I got it for my 5 years old boy for Christmas. He and his little 3 year old brother love to work out with Tony! They say :""This is fun! Tony is so funny!"" Great buy!",1233100800,2,232,3.66
8247776,5,B0012TTUZY,WE all love it and have a great time.  If you do any of Tony workouts your kids will love having there own,1229385600,,106,3.608695652173913
8247777,5,B0012TTUZY,"I am biased because I'm doing P90X and P90X+, and so are my friends, some of whom have gone to Tony Horton's workout camps and we all just love Tony! He is great inspiration; he is in great shape, and most important of all, he makes working out fun.

When  I first bought P90X, my 6 year old would do some exercises with me, but the workouts are close to an hour long with a lot of different (and tiring) moves. He would crack up at some of Tony's comments, and was always excited when I put the DVD on (yes, it sounds crazy....but Tony's great!!)

Anyway, I was happy to find this kids' video. It's actually got a lot of moves from P90X, modified for kids. It's a pretty good workout, too! It incorporates fun into some serious moves that really strengthen and provide cardio at the same time.

Go, wacky jacks!",1228348800,9,812,4.287581699346405
