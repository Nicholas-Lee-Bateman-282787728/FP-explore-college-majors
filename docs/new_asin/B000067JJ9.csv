1716839,5,B000067JJ9,"'Me & Mrs Jones' is light, entertaining and romantic. It is well written, acted and filmed. Even the minor characters have personality. Though in todays world with security concerns, specificly our leaders it is unreal to believe the ease at which Harry Fletcher (Robson Green) gains access to the Prime Minister (Caroline Goodall), but if you put aside that, the movie is enjoyable from start to finish.",1044921600,16,404,5.044776119402985
1716936,4,B000067JJ9,"Although this one isn't as good as Reckless, it is still a lot of fun. I wish someone would write another romantic comedy for Robson Green. Alas, the only thing we can watch him in now is a depressing crime shows...such a waste of one of the sexiest men on TV.",1374883200,3,260,4.117647058823529
1716937,5,B000067JJ9,"My all time favorite romantic comedy. Suspend disbelief, sit back, and enjoy a great ride! Also has a great supporting cast!",1372118400,,124,4.9523809523809526
1716938,4,B000067JJ9,"I saw this movie on TV many years ago and was delighted to be able to see it again, mainly because of Robson Green.",1365033600,,115,3.8333333333333335
1716939,5,B000067JJ9,this movie was very good. I really enjoy Britain base movies and romance movies.the acting was great. I fyou enjoyed this try watching more masterpiece theater movies,1358380800,,166,5.185185185185185
1716940,2,B000067JJ9,I love the movie and always have but the DVD I received kept freezing and appeared damaged.  Should I return it to you to get a replacement?,1358208000,,140,4.185185185185185
1716941,5,B000067JJ9,"I really enjoyed this movie, nice twists , turns and suprises.  Great to have a marriage that the couple still loves and understands each other although they know the marraige has really ended.  Amicable.  Refreshing to see the understanding.  Robson Green, enticing as usual.",1356048000,2,276,5.204545454545454
1716942,5,B000067JJ9,"The story was a little difficult to believe but very entertaining.  I intend to keep it, mainly because I think Robson Green just gets better and better.  He does comedy, drama and sweet little movies like this and I know I will watch it again.  The story involves a man who is placed to protect the Prime Minister and what a nice job he does.  Everyone played their parts very well. Scenes were well shot and there were lots of chuckles.  I can imagine reaching the position of Prime Minister and leaving it all for lovely blue-eyed Mr. Green.  Buy it - you'll enjoy it if you just let your brain wander in space  for a while.",1350345600,,627,4.3076923076923075
1716943,5,B000067JJ9,I love Robson Green .  This is fun romp into UK politics but not really believable but fun all the same!,1336780800,,104,3.9523809523809526
1716944,5,B000067JJ9,I enjoy Robson Green... can play any part  very well.  this is not as serious as most of the parts he plays!!  It is just a nice movie to sit and enjoy!,1335484800,,152,3.6875
1716945,5,B000067JJ9,"I was taken by surprise by Me & Mrs. Jones. A Robson Green fan, I've enjoyed everything I've ever seen him in. But this movie brought tears to my eyes! The dance sequence between ""Harry Fletcher"" and the Prime Minister was poignant and evocative of earlier times. I loved the ending; I don't think I've seen such a satisfying romance since the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan vehicles (another reviewer mentioned Sleepless in Seattle; I think if someone loved that movie, they'll love Me & Mrs. Jones also).",1332979200,,494,4.755813953488372
1716966,4,B000067JJ9,"I enjoyed watching ""Me and Mrs. Jones"" I am a fan of Robson Green and I thought the film was pretty good. I also like the movies that ""Masterpiece Theater"" has on TV. as I don't always get to see them I thought here's one I haven't seen before. I was surprised as I found it quite entertaining.",1317081600,2,294,4.086206896551724
1716967,5,B000067JJ9,Love Robsen Green and loved this lighthearted romance. Who would have thought you could turn such an unlikely script into something so believable.  loved the plot twists.,1258502400,,170,5.296296296296297
1716968,5,B000067JJ9,"I'm an American who loves Robson Green and his chemistry with Caroline Goodall is great in this escapist romantic comedy!  I appreciate one reviewer's comparison to ""Sleepless in Seattle"" which I also liked very much but liked this even better!  The supporting characters were well acted, the script interesting and pace exactly right.  I played it for a guy and he liked it too - deeming is was much better than most ""chick flicks"".  I recommend it as wonderful escapist fare for the romance that lies buried in all of us!  Nice to see Phillip Quast in a dramatic role.  I've only seen him in the Les Miz concert and admired his voice and acting ability.  It deserves the ""Masterpiece Theater"" showing and so glad I added it to my DVD collection.  Can watch it more than once!  Green and Goodall are both wonderful to watch - Ivan was also fun and had some of the best comedic lines which he made the most of.  If you like romance and seduction, you'll love this movie.",1251072000,8,970,4.491428571428571
1716969,5,B000067JJ9,A funny and serious film all in one. A good story that could be fiction or non-fiction. Peter Firth does well in this film.,1246665600,4,123,4.166666666666667
1716970,5,B000067JJ9,"I love politics and had always admired Margaret Thatcher's strength as a global leader though certainly not ALL of her politics.  I also admired the way she conducted herself.  This film shows the real side of politics with its manipulations and vulnerabilities.  If you like under-stated romance rather than sex-thrownin-your-face type movies, this one is for you.  There are so many ""hot"" under the collar moments, its a fabulous treat.

Definitely worth purchasing for men and women. Not a chick-flick. I've known men who have enjoyed it too.",1216512000,6,545,5.1477272727272725
1716971,4,B000067JJ9,"Thoroughly enjoyed Me and Mrs. Jones,and Robson Green's a delight.  Enjoyed his character's growth and the other characters  - esp. his friend whose house gets used for their 'dates' and his crush on the PM's bodyguard!",1182384000,4,219,5.055555555555555
1716972,5,B000067JJ9,Absolutely delightful. Robson Green and cast are right on their marks.  Great escapist fare.,1168300800,5,92,5.571428571428571
1716973,5,B000067JJ9,"I just watched Me & Mrs. Jones and it was a very good movie.  In the vein of Sleepless in Seattle, this is a charming little story of finding love where you least expect it.  And Robson Green showed once again why he is such a popular actor in Britain.  He is very believable in the role and is a joy to watch.",1137888000,7,310,3.888888888888889
1716974,5,B000067JJ9,"This is a very good movie to watch and especially if you are familiar with European customs. Robson Green is one of my favorite British actors and I tend to buy a lot of his movies when the movies are released. If you like Cinderella stories and maybe like to escape from reality every so often, then this is the movie for you. All the characters are very believeable and true to form. Even though something like this probably would not happen in real life, its always nice to dream. I recommend this movie to anybody, male or female.",1126224000,17,534,4.404040404040404
1716975,4,B000067JJ9,"First aired on Masterpiece Theatre, this charming TV-movie stars Robson Green (Touching Evil, Reckless) and Caroline Goodall (The Mists of Avalon). Set in England, Green plays a tabloid reporter writing under the name ""Mrs. Jones,"" who is assigned by his boss to try to get some dirt on the prime minister, Goodall. Ingratiating himself into her re-election campaign, he finds himself drawn to her, and must weigh his feelings against his assignment, while dodging the scrutiny of her staff.
It's a lovely, romantic movie, not to be taken too seriously. This point should be stressed as much occurs in the movie which takes a great deal of disbelief. Think of it as a modern fairy tale that sometimes surprises you. Well-acted by all, as I've come to expect from these productions, and Green and Goodall have nice chemistry together. In summary, it's fluff, but it's intelligent fluff.
[As a film note, both Keeley Hawes and Peter Firth (MI-5/Spooks television series actors) appear in this movie, although never in the same scenes.)",1069372800,36,1033,5.046783625730995

7963292,5,B000067JJ9,"Robson Green and Caroline Goodall have great chemistry in this romantic comedy.  Love that Robson Green sings the theme song and recorded it on his solo album ""Moment In Time"" which is a wonderful CD.",1466121600,,200,4.714285714285714
