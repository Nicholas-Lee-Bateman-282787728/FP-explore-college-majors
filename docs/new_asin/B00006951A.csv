1729703,3,B00006951A,The only reason this movie does not fall into a Movie of the Week  category is because it gave the villan some humanities.  But it was not enough to save the film.  Jeremy Renner did a great job with what he was given.,1032998400,,218,4.023255813953488
1729704,2,B00006951A,"For the most part, DAHMER is a failure ... The film, especially the direction, wasn't good enough as a character study alone, there is no visual feel ( it looks made-for-TV ) and nothing in the film made me feel any sympathy for the lead ... I mention this first because I think that's what the makers were going for, because there is really no gore, no cannibalism, nothing particularly scary or disturbing ... and let's face it, when you make a film about one of the most notoriously horrific people in criminal history, it should convey some of that feeling ...... The one thing I thought was done well was the transformation of Jeffery in the flashbacks: he was convincing as a teenager ... ... Overall, the film comes across to me as an attempt to show Dahmer in a different light, but it fails in it's own pretense ... It seems as if a group of politically correct amateurs got together and tried to make a thought-provoking film, and in doing so, skirted over the meat ( sorry, couldn't resist ) of the actual story ... If they wanted to make a film about a troubled and emotionally tormentented man, fine, but it's not interesting on that level ... and if they wanted to make a successful film about a cannibalistic necrophiliac, well, they failed with that big time ... DAHMER is far less interesting than the actual account of Jeffery Dahmer's life ...",1032998400,4,1362,4.540650406504065

1729706,4,B00006951A,"This is one of those strange films that people are afraid to say they have seen, that by showing interest in such a film will leave them permanently branded as deviant.  Actually this exploration of the bizarre life of Jeffrey Dahmer is more an exploration of a mind descending into serial killing, mutilation, and cannibalization - a mind that just happened to be housed in a gay man- than it is a Hollywood Horror movie.  Jeremy Renner surveys this tough role with all the little nuances that bring us into the mechinations of the serial killer's psyche, never making him win our approval, but at the same time offering a canvas of life incidences that somehow make us approach understanding of why this could happen.  If we never study horrific deeds, we will never be able to treat or prevent them.  Renner makes Dahmer a rather straight forward, obsessed young man, a youth who craves physical affection yet can only find it by relying on drugging his love interests. Pathetic on all levels.  Much of what this film reveals is that the beginnings of Dahmer's illness were confined to the available sex clubs which are actually out there.  Then the seductions broaden and we are shown how he gradually overcame his conquests and descended into mayhem.  The victims we meet are likeable young men and the acting level is rather high in these difficult cameos. We are spared most of the sick and grizzly details of these murders and it is to the director's credit not to inundate us with that.  The filming and the music and the lighting is all macabre and in keeping with the subject matter.  In short, this is a 'psychobiography' of one of the last century's gruesome serial killers, but it is presented in a way that encourages thought rather than repulsion.  Maybe more people will see it now that it is available on DVD.",1031788800,11,1827,4.68125
1729707,3,B00006951A,"The movie was tasteful, but to tasteful.  I understand that it wasn't intended to be a ""horror flick"" and that wasn't what I was expecting.  I believe that the movie was to show some insight to Dahmer's motives and they were somewhat successful on that (of course we'll never be able to completely understand). The most important thing was left out, the cannibalism.  Jeffrey Dahmer had bizzare murdering and raping rituals, but I believe peoples curiosity of this infamous man was the cannibalism.  The subject doesn't even get touched in the movie.  Aside from that, I thought the movie was very good.  Casting Jeremy Renner as Dahmer was a good call.  He's attractive in a understated way just as Dahmer was.  He potrays the quiet, mousy, friendly, and semi-normal personallity that Dahmer was said to have.  Some of the supporting actors weren't very good ones, but Artel Kayru (Rodney) was quite skillful in his preformance. The cinematography was lovely and Jeremy Renner's transformation between young and old ""Jeffrey"" was flawless.  All and all a good movie.  It's worth watching.",1031356800,9,1089,5.027932960893855
1729708,5,B00006951A,"I found Dahmer to be an interesting exploration into the mind of a serial killer. Light on exposition(flashbacks aside), it allows the viewer to fill in the gaps as to Dahmer's motivation. I think Jeremy Renner did a terrific job portraying Dahmer as a soft-spoken misfit and outsider who's just looking for love. David Jacobson explores the duality of Dahmer effectively and subtlely, as when Dahmer watches people having sex with a mixture of detachment and disdain,and then seeks out his own sexual liaisons with disastrous results. He is so full of self-loathing and shame that he must first drug, then kill his victims to avoid facing the rejection he is sure will happen. When he finally meets Artel Kayaru as Rodney, he has met his alter-ego...someone carefree and uninhibited and it's apparent Dahmer is experiencing conflicting emotions and perhaps some kind of revelation. But it's too late to save him. Low on gore and violence, which was refreshing. Cinematography was first-rate. Locations were depressingly banal and middle America, settings which seem to breed the most monstrous impulses. A lowkey and worthwhile look into the results of unchecked fear rage and shame, and an invitation to explore the little Dahmer in all of us.",1027728000,6,1245,5.107843137254902
1729709,2,B00006951A,"This ""art-film"" about the life of serial-killer-cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer is pretty low-key and will probably  bore horror fans looking for a sensational or gory thriller.  In fact, the film never even touches on much of the graphic and grisly deeds committed by Dahmer --- there's no vat of acid, there's no cannibalism, there's no body parts in the refrigerator.
Instead, the film is more of just a grim character study - through numerous flashbacks we see a young teenaged Dahmer already troubled with a fascination with death.  His father, played by Bruce Davison, tries to help his son, but even at such a young age, Jeffrey has already gone over the edge.  Why else would he keep a severed head in his closet?
Cutting back and forth from past events to the present, the film focuses on several key moments in Dahmer's life, but leaving out many others and rearranging the timelines.  We see a teenaged Dahmer killing and dismembering (mostly off-screen) the teenaged ""hitch-hiker"" (here, just a guy walking down the street) in one flashback (probably the grisliest part of the film) and see Dahmer drugging guys at a bar before graduating to his ""drilling technique"", but that's about it for horrific moments.  The present day stuff is mostly Dahmer seducing and trying to kill one black guy he picked up at a knife shop...but the seduction  goes on way too long and doesn't really end up anywhere (and it isn't even what actually happened).  The juxtopistion between present-day and flashbacks works OK for the most part, but after a while, the film just loses it's momentum because both timelines become too fractured.  And there is simply not enough horror in the story.  Not that the film needs gore and blood and sleaze....but the way it is, it could almost play like the story of any mentally-challenged guy off the street.  The filmmakers have made an admirable attempt at a mature, somber and respectable depiction of a grisly serial-killer's life...but this IS the story of a GRISLY serial killer so to avoid most of the GRISLY details make it all just seem very trite in the end.
Jeremy Renner is very good as Dahmer, both in present day and uncannily looking much younger as a teenager in the flashbacks (with the help of large wire-rimmed glasses and slouched shoulders).  Obviously chosen for his resemblance to the real Dahmer, Renner still manages to convey a vulnerability, charm and underlying menace in the role.  But unfortunately, this Dahmer has barely killed anyone, his apartment is clean as can be (one clean corpse in the bed), and apparently he has no craving for human flesh since there is absolutely no hint at cannibalism.  And don't expect any wrap-up or conclusion to the tale --- it's not here.  What we are left with is simply a sanitized and piece-meal view of a troubled mind.  It's definitely worth a look for the acting alone and some grim depictions of this psychopath's life, but don't go in expecting anything more than that.  It's really neither an art film nor an exploitation film - so what audience is this for anyway???
The upcoming DVD from ""First Look"" appears to be another one of their bare-bones (no pun intended) discs and it will only offer a Full-Frame version of the film.  Cheap!",1026000000,7,3238,4.803603603603603

1729889,4,B00006951A,"The oddest part about this movie is also, oddly, what none of the reviews here seem to cover, which is the extended set piece that takes us to the end and is the heart of the movie. One more observation before getting to that: The movie has some aim to be funny (in a very dark way); young D. explaining to his father that there is gay pornography in a sealed box when there is actually a head, verges on the (darkly) priceless. But the core of the movie is the story of ""the one that got away"" -- a slick black kid that D. meets in the Army/Navy store who comes over for a home date and deftly eludes the killer -- only because he is playing hard to get and is simply cooler and more slippery than JD. It's all about the flirt to him. The next day the kid comes back, throws a rock through the window. Because he feels rejected. The kid actually *likes* D -- could love have saved the serial killer? True, the movie reasons as to why D. became D. are only given a cursory answer, but there is still some kind of truth to it's ""we may never know"" attitude -- when at the end, given the choice to seek mental health care, instead (visually and literally) D. instead jumps the fence.",1419379200,,1181,4.139130434782609
1729890,4,B00006951A,"A while back, I read the Graphic Novel ""My Friend Dahmer"" (MFD).  I thought that ""Friend"" should be in quotes, because in comic-book format, the author Derf Backderf more than implies that he and Jeffrey Dahmer were never really ""friends.""  Mr. Backderf kept Mr. Dahmer at more than an arm's length, as the former thought the latter was way more than ""odd.""  And Mr. Backderf was not the only teenage peer of Mr. Dahmer's to shun the serial killer in waiting; most others did as well.

Most people don't realize it, but they have a built-in bias about overrating their own opinions and actions ex post facto.  A specific example might help explain that bias:  ""Look, we know that Dahmer guy turned out bad.  I avoided him, and so therefore I must be smart.""  Well, this is not necessarily the case, as I argued in a review of MFD.  It just might be the case that, because Mr. Dahmer was shunned, he felt isolated, and because he felt isolated, he started drinking heavily, and because he started drinking heavily, he decided to whack a guy upside the head and cut that guy into pieces.  Yes, this is a little too simplistic -- surely there was way more to Mr. Dahmer's downhill slide than that -- but I think you get the basic idea.  In the more general sense, this may be an error in implication; did A cause B or did B cause A?  Did shunning Mr. Dahmer cause him to become a serial killer, or did others realize he would become a serial killer so they shunned him?

But in that review, I also argued that, most likely, what happened to Mr. Dahmer was probably a bi-directional implication; it was most likely a two-way street:  Mr. Dahmer's ""friends"" avoided collisions with him by steering clear of his lane, but he would have become a bad driver -- or a serial killer -- anyways, as he needed to take Driver's Ed.  Or maybe more psychology or counseling.  But the fact that Mr. Dahmer was shunned surely didn't help an already-bad situation.  At any rate, to finally take the off ramp from this driving metaphor, there was probably a nasty feedback loop with both.

I have also screened  ""The Jeffrey Dahmer Files,"" which is an oddly funny documentary, oddly fitting for the killer.  Patrick Kennedy -- the ex-detective that helped capture Mr. Dahmer -- is heavily featured, and he is very funny; he uses levity in very entertaing ways.  Mr. Kennedy even had an odd affection for Mr. Dahmer in some ways, so much so that the policeman went so far as to loan the killer a decent shirt to wear in court, which I thought was ""touching.""  But I have been waiting for a good standard true-crime book about Mr. Dahmer, and thus far, it appears that there isn't one, outside of a very expensive older read available only in non-digital format.  But most books are either way too short on length, or way too short in ratings.  Perhaps Mr. Kennedy should write a book himself on Mr. Dahmer.  (Has he already written a book?  I can't find one.  Anyone know?  I believe that he is a professor near Milwaukee now, so he should be smart enough to write a sharp read.)

But at least there is a pretty good movie about the late serial killer.  This one.

I actually like this film more than most.  First of all, I think that Jeremy Renner was the perfect casting choice here.  Sure, Mr. Renner doesn't look exactly like Mr. Dahmer, but that's not important.  I've argued ad nauseum that casting directors too often search to the ends of the earth for an actor that looks just like the person that's being played, which can easily cause a film to veer off course.  Often, a movie falls off the dramatic edge in these scenarios.  Not so here.  It seems that Mr. Renner was more interested in navigating the behavior and quirks of Mr. Dahmer, and I think that the actor found a truly safe harbor with his portrayal.

I also like how the writer and director try to get into Mr. Dahmer's head by having Mr. Dahmer try to get inside the head of his victims.  While ""Dahmer"" shows him drilling into one young man's skull with a drill -- perhaps construction workers might like this film best? -- he then suddenly puts down the drill, lays next to the victim, looks into that victim's eyes, listens to that victim's heartbeat, and hugs that victim affectionately.  This most likely is the real behavior of the serial killer, as he was seeking affection, affection that he didn't get from anyone when he was young, including his classmates.  Including perhaps even Mr. Backderf.  So this film does try to explain some of Mr. Dahmer's psyche.

The film opens with a sort-of David-Lynchian ""Blue Velvet"" beginning.  The upbeat music, while first sounding inappropriate for the subject matter -- almost everyone knows something about this sordid tale, after all -- surprisingly works.  It juxtaposes ""happy happy"" against the horror that you know will be coming.  But I also noticed that Mr. Dahmer was a candy maker, which is interesting; it reminded me of Dean Corll, the ""Candyman Killer"" from Texas in the 70s.  My first thought:  ""What is it with serial killers and chocolate, anyways?""  Well, everybody likes chocolate, I suppose.  Even serial killers.  But during the film, Mr. Renner explains to a future victim that ""you can get really tired of chocolate.""  Too bad Mr. Dahmer never grew tired of killing.

I guess that ""Dahm"" means something like ""blessed"" in some other language than English, whatever that's worth.  After watching this film, I'm not so sure; perhaps it should mean ""cursed.""  But I'll still go with a mild-to-intermediate recommendation on ""Dahmer"" the movie.  I might pass on Dahmer the person however, perhaps just as his ""friend"" Derf Backderf did.  Maybe I'm part of the problem too.",1418774400,,5693,4.631368631368631
1729891,3,B00006951A,"My main interest in serial killers is learning how they think.  What makes someone think it's okay to do these things?  I'll admit I like slasher movies and flicks like the Saw series, but that is not what I was looking for here.  I wanted a real look at these twisted people.  I was first drawn to this collection when I heard Steve Railsback played the title role in the Ed Gein story.  And that movie is by far the best of these three films.  I loved Railsback's portrayal of Charlie Manson in the original Helter Skelter.  And Steve did a wonderful job in his role as Gein, who was a much different type of person.  Ed Gein as a movie by itself was almost worth 4 stars.  This flick which was also produced by Railsback, made an effort to show Ed's childhood and offered some insight as to how he got screwed up.  It even touched on how his brother died in a suspicious fire and how Ed may have started the fire to hide the fact that he killed his brother first.  This movie tends to assume those accusations are true.  It shows Ed robbing graves, but it seems to downplay how much he is suspected of indulging in that behavior.  You don't see in this movie how much he does that or how he switched from grave-robbing to murder.  The film shows the two murders he was convicted of, but seems to ignore the allegations of other murders he may have committed.  Like the other two films, this movie tries to avoid exploitations of blood and violence, but does show measured amounts of gore.  That is a plus in all three films.  Ed Gein also shows one short scene of Ed prancing around in a girl suit that he made from skinning his victims.  This is admirably done with an effort to avoid exploitation.  They show Ed's capture and explain his jail time and death.  It also shows a number of the horrible ""trophies"" he kept in his house and barn.  However, this movie never wraps up how much this sick ticket did.  It tries to show some of ""how"" this happened and some of what happened.  It gave you a few start dates and end dates, but it lacks a true chronology, timeline or detail as far as what all happened in this small Wisconsin town.  There is great acting by everyone involved, especially Carrie Snodgrass who does a fabulous job in the role as Ed's mother.  There is certain function and purpose in this flick.  There is a strong view of this unbalanced man.  There is a certain amount of insight.  However, the lack of a time-line or details of what actually transpired leaves this film with a lack of purpose and focus.  I don't mind the fact that they didn't exploit the blood and gore, but the random depiction of events and lack of chronology makes this film fall a bit short of fulfilling its intended purpose.

The other two films are easy to review together, because they both have the same strengths and weaknesses.  As I stated, Ted Bundy and Dahmer both showed a little carnage but both made a gallant effort to avoid exploitation with overkill, so to speak.  That is good.  Both movies were very well cast and the acting was fantastic throughout.  However, each of these efforts were 3-star films at best.  Neither movie showed any look at the childhood of either of these monsters.  No insight was offered to show how either of these men got so messed up.  I liked the choice of Bruce Davidson as Jeffrey Dahmer's father.  I'll always remember Bruce's role as the title character in Willard, the '70s flick about the mousy young man who befriends the rats that are infesting his mother's house.  As in Willard, Bruce does a great job in his role as the man who struggles to understand and help his troubled son, Jeffrey.  However, there is no look into the past.  You never see how Jeffrey got to where he ended up: the sick serial killer!  You see some of what Dahmer does, just like they show in the Bundy flick.......but neither film gives a clear time-line or detail about how many murders they may have committed or what extent these psychos reached.  Both movies seem to be a random depiction of some of the events that happened.....and nothing more.  The Bundy movie shows his execution by electrocution, but lacks any storyline, focus or purpose.  Dahmer doesn't even show his capture.  The last thing you see is Jeffrey's father taking him to a clinic for his alcoholism, but Jeffrey doesn't enter the building......he just runs off into the woods.  Then they say ""he was eventually captured"" and they give the date he was killed by a fellow inmate in prison and the movie's over.  I mean, what the hell???  Both movies lack a time-line, function, direction, focus and purpose.  All they tell you is ""here is a brief depiction of some of the things these monsters did in no particular order.  We won't tell you how they got here.....just some of the things they did......no focus or purpose.....now the movie's over......go away!""  I don't know why they bothered making these two movies.

In the end, all three of these movies had good points, but they could've been so much more!",1418169600,,5011,4.503884572697003

The flashback to the first victim was probably the most accurate depiction of any of his victims, but still very lacking.  The main focus on this movie was an intended victim named Rodney. Rodney was completely fictional.  In one scene we see Jeffrey only has 2 pills left which would mean his standard method of drugging would not work with Rodney.  The real person in this scenario had his carotid artery slashed and his body was mutilated post mortem.  Additionally, Dahmer hadn't started drilling into heads yet, but this scene with Rodney seemingly took place right after the kid who nearly escaped,  because the kid was still in the bedroom in a ""zombie like"" state at the time Rodney was there.  Lets shift gears to that kid, The real Dahmer had attempted to put him into a ""zombie like"" state, which was an epic failure, the kid died right after he was injected with some chemical, I don't remember what,  through the hole in his skull, yet in the movie it was portrayed as a success.  Lets not forget that Dahmer mutilated these people post mortem and kept body parts in the freezer and a large drum, and that he cannibalized many of his victims.  He was much more brutal, sick, twisted, and disturbed then this movie made him out to be.

Unlike the Gacy film, Dahmer was more typical of what you see from these types of movies. Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes may have been just as shocking as Gacy's, but Dahmer was of a completely different personality, one that doesn't really equate to film. Unlike Gacy, Dahmer was really shy and introverted, avoiding interacting with people that he wasn't planning on killing. The movie version of Dahmer's was honestly as boring as a Horror film could get. Much of it shows Dahmer alone in his apartment, torturing his victims, and much of the time, there isn't even any dialog! Jeremy Renner stars and does as good of a job as someone can do with a role like this, but to be completely honest I found this film to be nothing but boring. Even the graphic scenes the film portrays in order to shock you, don't really cut it. Dahmer may have been just as deranged as Gacy, but the two men were very different.

This movie was solely based on his younger days and his struggles with being homosexual and his dysfunctional relationship with his dad.

It didn't answer any of my questions: How many victims were there? How did he choose his victims? How was he able to get away with drugging and raping so many men in one club? How was he able to lure so many young men to his home? Why did he feel the need to rape men who were willing to engage in consensual intercourse? Why did he let one of his victims escape? Why did he feed on his victims?

His outward normality protects him from the occasional attention of police, parents, and acquaintances, none of whom can imagine that this apparently nice young man is performing brain surgery with drills on other young men in order to turn them into his docile sex slaves.

It's not an in depth mind of the monster that Dahmer was but it does give you a look at his life while keeping the gore factor to a minimum.  Another movie well done without exploiting the horrors of what this guy did simply because it wasn't necessary.  We are well aware of what Dahmer did to his victims so this movie already had that creep factor going for it before the cameras even started rolling.  It does go back and forth between flashbacks to when he started killing (that we know of) and to his current day near the end of his slaughter.  The movie doesn't cover any of the molestation/assault charges Dahmer faced or that after his last court appearance for that he was averaging one kill a week.  A decently done movie and great acting by Jeremy Renner who portrayed Dahmer's awkward demeanor very well.

1730080,2,B00006951A,"While the creators obviously did their research regarding the series of events that was Dahmer's life, they failed miserably at depicting the man as one with true Antisocial Personality. There were obvious misunderstandings of the disorder throughout the entire movie. For example, in a scene in which Dahmer is ""trying"" to dismember a victim, he is shown being hesitant, disgusted, and almost vomiting. This is obviously not accurate, as Dahmer's profile fits one that is (and has been since childhood) fascinated with death, torture, and especially dissection. This scene is therefore showing Dahmer as someone without ASPD, in fact just by these reactions it is showing him as someone who is not wanting to kill or dissect. Shortly after disposing of the body, they show him sobbing and clutching the victim's jacket. What made them even think they should be incorporating an ounce of empathy into this character? (Granted, this scene was his ""first kill,"" but I still stand by my belief that someone with his history would have reacted more with fascination than any kind of disgust, and that there most certainly would not have been any kind of regret.)

Overall, I think what they were trying to do here was to get inside the killer's mind to show you some reason as to WHY he did what he did. There were other instances that did show an interesting perspective, but the problem is there is absolutely no rhyme or reason for these people's motives. You cannot just humanize them into a character of a movie with the same emotions and feelings as everyone else, because it's not true. And yet I feel that is what they've tried to do here.

With that being said, the alternative is somewhat unthinkable - a movie inside the mind of a serial killer as disturbed as Dahmer, without any display of empathy or emotion, might be unbearable for the audience, so I am not sure what the medium is.

The overall pace of the movie was erratic, going from flashbacks to present moment, and I found myself often having trouble keeping up with which victim was which and which situation was which. In the end, they didn't even show what eventually led to his capture. The movie was never really concluded. I would have much rather had a movie that was linear, and included all the facts.",1350345600,3,2278,4.762025316455696

This is a huge task that was placed on the very capable shoulders of Jeremy Renner. It is almost chilling to see an actor bring so much depth to a character, especially Jeffery Dahmer.

He is a superb actor and deserves topnotch scripts. Now for the film... The scenes are too long and get boring. They hint at his mindset, but only cover three of the 17 murders. The horrific acts are disguised behind the ebb and flow of flashbacks butting against the present - often it is hard to tell which timeframe we are in at any given point. The crimes are choreographed and shadowed, seeming more like a dance than the blood-curdling violence of a madman. We only see hints of his mutilations, no depictions of cannibalism. He drills into the Thai boy's temple, but we get no explanation what this is supposed to achieve in his sick mind. No one wants to see these acts, but they are at the core of the grisly story. Renner plays his part with such charm, one would almost welcome being a victim (I know!)... sending the wrong message and failing to tell the horrific story with any measure of realism. I will seek out other Renner films (didn't like Hurt Locker), but I can't understand how a director could make a film like this without first examining its (non-)impact and calibre.

It made its point from the perspective of how the crimes were lead into, and where they stemmed from, but it didn't give graphic detail of his real crimes against nature. The truth of the matter is he had no respect for life, and disregard for humanity.  All he cared about was his sick urges, and how to fulfill them regardless of who they harmed. And this didn't just stem from people, he had a fascination for this from animals at an early age the evolved to people, mainly the ones he sought sexual gratification, but could only fulfill them in his sick demented way of handling life by killing them during the act of sexual pleasure, even torturing. This film presents a true blue stalker with one thing in mind, to solve his sick fantasies which he claims went out of control. The movie is good enough for a family to watch without getting too carried away about showing his real deeds in the dungeon of his mind.  Its almost like a made for TV movie. The lead actor does a fair job at presenting one of the creepiest people to ever walk the earth, and one with whom, no matter what he says to make his point of view seem like a simple falling out experience that just snowballed, would make any sense to myself on acts that are totally unjustifiable. He's thoughtless, corrupt, and just a plain ignorant person, and I pity him for not knowing life for what it is truly about, and that's suffering to cope with those sick hidden urges that most people share, but don't pursue because they don't want to fall from grace, they don't want to become killers, they don't want to become robbers.  Its not that they cant do it, its just that they refuse to do it.  Because no matter how you look at it, doing this sort of stuff is just plain crazy!",1311206400,,1820,4.423880597014925

1730125,1,B00006951A,"Getting this out of the way early; Jeremy Renner puts on a stellar acting performance, perfectly falling into the role and merging into him to give him the right amount of discomfort and pathos, even in cases where he's not committing crimes but doing such mundane things as talking about fish or ordering a drink.

The rest of the film, though, is a mess.  If they were attempting to merge different points in Dahmer's life, ""Memento"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" style, they made it too incomprehensible.  There's no real sense of past and present, and no real sense of while movies like Pulp Fiction and Memento pulled off their lack of linear storytelling spectacularly, this one has virtually nothing connecting each scene; they just happen in their own contained universes, and never overlap save for the presence of the Asian boy's corpse in one scene.

As to the character of Jeffrey Dahmer himself, you need only look up brief examples of what he did, not just in terms of rape, torture, killing, and necrophilia, but the things he did in his life, the things he's said, and his personality traits depicted through these actions.  The Jeffrey Dahmer in the film bears little to no resemblence to the real Dahmer.  He's creepy and offputting, but he's meek to an incredible degree, and incredibly buffoonish when it comes to the actual thing that made Dahmer famous/infamous; he always fumbles his attempts to overpower or outsmart someone, and ends up screwing up and looking stupid, or else resorting to brute force in order to overpower someone and kill them.

In fact, we never see any of his crimes beyond killing two people, and attempting to rape, but, as mentioned before, screwing up buffoonishly.  Scenes with his father and grandmother appear to have some meaning, but they never follow up on them in any meaningful way.  They're just there for some reason; as filler, or to show off such awkward moments as trying to convince his father not to open an old box that belonged to him to find his old ring, because he's hidden a dismembered head inside.

There's another scene in which his grandmother calls him over to help get a crow out of her house, and he eventually catches the bird, and stares down at it with a crazed expression.  This scene leads into another, and has absolutely nothing to do with it.  It appears, it contributes nothing in the way of character or story development, and it's never explained or returned to again.

If the director was going for a stylish, visual piece, they forgot to realize that the images are largely disconnected from the plot.  Or what little there is of the plot; I honestly don't think there is any plot beyond ""Jeffrey Dahmer doing things and behaving sympathetically""",1294185600,2,2725,4.782515991471215

1730127,5,B00006951A,"David Jacobson wrote (with David Birke) and directed this probing psychological study of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.  It is an extraordinarily fine film on every level, not the least of which is the manner in which Jacobson elected to dissect the slowly rotting mind of an avatar (as in the incarnation of evil) model of alienation, profound loneliness, and victim of sexual frustration that eventually explodes into the heinous results of those unrecognized symptoms. It is a masterpiece of understatement, not straying away from the horror of the idea of what is happening, but at the same time not relying on the graphic depictions that so many film on similar subjects stoop to in order to attract audiences.  The Dahmer of Jacobson's vision is a lonely youth, a man who craves attention and affection of others but must resort to drugs and violence to reach his goals of partnering with a fellow human being, a coming together that though the means are abominable the end result is an expression of tenderness that few films have been able to reveal.

Much of the success of this superb film is due to the acting of Jeremy Renner as Dahmer.  He has created a character whose shy and desperate needs progress until he is able to achieve his obsession of feeling affection from others.  The scenes in the bars where he repeatedly dances with attractive men, drugs their drinks, and then helps them to the back rooms where, comatose, they become his lovers for the moment (so very subtly suggested by the fine cinematography technique of strobe lighting momentary glimmers by Chris Manley with the able assistance of editor Biasha Shom).  So much of the seduction and actually killing is left to the viewer's imagination that it is only with three encounters - played with virtuosity by Artel Kayru, Matt Newton, and Dion Basco - that include the verbal interplay that reveal Dahmer's submerged yet profound needs and frustrations.  Jacobson's use of flashbacks to Dahmer's experiences that fed his inability to relate to feelings that were denied him by society spare us also of witnessing all of the murders and associated atrocities that Dahmer committed, and in the end that technique helps us understand how a boy to man can alter in the direction of maturation to become one of the most famous serial killers of our time. (FACTS: Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer (May 21, 1960 - November 28, 1994) was an American serial killer and sex offender. Dahmer murdered 17 men and boys - many of whom were of African or Asian descent - between 1978 and 1991, with the majority of the murders occurring between 1987 and 1991. His murders were particularly gruesome, involving rape, torture, dismemberment, necrophilia and cannibalism. On November 28, 1994, he was beaten to death by an inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution, where he had been incarcerated.)

Made in 2002 and garnering many Indie awards, it is amazing that this film was not taken more seriously by the public.  Perhaps the immaturity of the audience prevented those who usually flock to the blood and slaughter films of the 'Saw' series, 'Freddy Krueger' films, etc from accepting  this story as a true one, not a festival of CGI effects.  Jeremy Renner is now recognized as one of our leading actors: perhaps this film should be released again so that audiences can appreciate the masterful degree of his acting skills.

1730157,5,B00006951A,"It's no doubt that actor Jeremy Renner made this movie watchable.  His performance is incredibly strong as the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.  He managed to show a guy who really had two completely different lives.  The scariness of the film is that serial killers could be among us and we would never know.  Of course we wouldn't. Dahmer managed to live a regular life just like the rest of us, but was moonlighting as a vicious killer who managed to side step the authorities.  The films focus is on the duality of his life and is more a humanistic story rather than a sensational horror flick.  It's clear this is an independent low budget film so you have to cut it some slack that not enough was done with it.

Dahmer is no exception; in fact, it is worse than the others.  I'm afraid I can't buy into any of the artsy-fartsy, pseudo-intellectual spin this film gets in some quarters.  Quite frankly, all I saw was a really bad movie.  I simply don't see how you can present any kind of story about Jeffrey Dahmer without at least alluding to the fact that the man freaking ate his victims.  All the psychological nonsense this movie throws your way with its endless flashbacks and fictionalized recreation of dialogue and events is patently useless because it ignores the most telling and significant of his psychological problems.  My problem is not the fact that this film is really just a character study of a troubled young man; rather, it's the fact that it's a very bad character study.

I'm afraid I really have nothing good to say about this film.  I wasn't really impressed by Jeremy Renner's performance as Dahmer, I despised the constant flashback loops (which I consider the sole domain of weak directors) throughout the story, and I thought the ambiguous ending pretty much encapsulated everything that was wrong with the entire film.  This is a film almost wholly lacking in substance.

Obviously, with the whole cannibalism thing totally off the table, this film barely registers on the blood and gore meter.  I don't have a problem with that, especially since I was already well aware of the exceedingly disturbing nature of Jeffrey Dahmer's murderous acts.  I do have a problem with the fact that this film really only hints at the scope and depravity of all the murders.  If you already know a good bit about Jeffrey Dahmer, you won't learn anything new in this film.  If you know nothing about Dahmer going in, you won't know much more about him at the end - but you may think you have some insight into his character.  That, in my opinion, is the crux of this film's many problems.",1259020800,6,2272,5.324929971988795
1730160,4,B00006951A,"I am a resident of Milwaukee, and remember very well the shock and awe of the Dahmer discoveries. For this reason, and that it received some prestigious nominations at the Indie Spirit awards, I was compelled to rent it. Indeed, the performances are fine, including those nominated actors Jeremy Ronner (Jeff) and Artel Kayaru (Rodney). Director David Jacobson wanted to explore the mind of a serial killer without gore or blood, and he is to be commended. His attempt to humanize Dahmer is admirable, though the film lacks focus. As I know it, Dahmer was diabolical in his methods, a lot more than the film shows. He had vats of acid in his apartment to aid in his disposal of bodies. The film left off at a time when his killing spree was at its peak (hoping for a sequel?), and there was no indication of his capture and trial and eventual incarceration on charges of mental instability (Duh). NOTE: The smell in the apt buiding was so bad, they finally tore it down. As an Indie, it was fine in handling this atrocious subject with dignity and true quality. As history, you can only be left baffled and confused. One of his victims, Joe Bradehoff, was my friend. I can understand why he might've been taken in by Dahmer's charm and smarm; Dahmer was a lot more good-looking than Mr. Renner. It's enough to give gay people a bad name.

1730162,1,B00006951A,"Yes, I found this movie horrible. It was dark, dreary, dull, and boring. Very boring because of repetitious killing scenes, all of whose endings were totally predictable. Dahmer was obnoxious and despicable in the manipulative way he operated. The violence and the sex WAS gratuitous and disgusting.

The story had a beginning without a middle or an end. It just meanders from one killing to another. Dahmer's psycho babbling was pointless as he attempts to analyze one of his potential victims. I saw nothing about his childhood that may have contributed to his madness. The scenes with his father when he was a teen were not credible because the father was a one-dimensional bad dad who, we're supposed to believe, created this Frankenstein son by dominating him and invading his privacy. Nonsense. This is a superficial conclusion and surely an oversimplification of a highly complex problem. We never find out the many causes that effected such inner hatred and vengeance that it erupted into such canabilistic violence. So many guys have had overbearing dads--but how many turned out to be a Dahmer?

This movie is just another sensationalistic attempt to exploit a killer who committed a series of ghastly, gruesome murders and offers neither understanding nor insight into his true motives. Dahmer is unclear and thus unsympathetic. Furthermore, the movie gave no information on how Dahmer was caught, tried, convicted, and imprisoned, and the circumstances leading to his murder in prison.

I wasted my money buying this. I threw my copy in the trash can--I wouldn't even donate it to Good Will (because that would be bad will) or to the Public Library.

The actor playing Dahmer was just FAIR, showing a limited range of understanding and expression of the depth of the character's internal dissension. It was all so perfunctural and matter-of-fact--just another ho-hum day of killing! And dismembering!",1238716800,,1912,5.158064516129032

1730165,4,B00006951A,"From 1978 until 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer lived a life that became the focal point of worldwide media interest Amongst the most well-documented portions of this were the acts of creating lobotomized sexual slaves, of keeping trophies of victims in various states of decomposition all around his home, and of having the mysterious ""blue barrel"" that was used for disposal in his home. Some of the lesser-known facts were that he worked in a Chocolate shop, that he had been arrested before because he had sexual contact with a minor, and that his family life was something that had been strained. When reading about him in the book his father's book wrote, (A Father's Story by Lionel Dahmer), you could see some of the ingredients that went from ""deviant sexual impulses"" and ""aberrant drug use""  and spiraled into something that nightmarishly consumed 7 people before the police finally intervened.
This is the story of some of that and of his younger years combined, with extreme liberties taken.

One of the things that made this movie different than a lot of other movie was the fact that it didn't focus on blood and gore as much as it did on the characterization of Dahmer. Jeffrey Renner does a great job doing that portrayal, keeping the awkward charm attributed to Dahmer and yet still giving Dahmer a methodical approach that seems cold and disjointed. The movie starts in the middle of Dahmer's killing spree and doesn't really offering conjecture as to why he does everything he does. It does offer the viewers little glimpses into Dahmer's life in a round-about way, however, putting together a portrait of what Dahmer was like. It begins with Dahmer manning the chocolate production line, and from follows Dahmer as he starts looking for people that suit his needs. The first he finds is one of his most well-known, the 14year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone, and goes into how he lured the boy into his home and how the police had intervened but had done nothing in the end. That seemed to be something typical with Dahmer and related something about him and his victims; he was white and was good at choosing words and his victims were minorities and were oftentimes ignored. Along the way the movie also backtracks in the film and shows us the first murder Dahmer participates in, a hitchhiker names Steven Hicks, and shows us how the words ""I didn't want him to leave"" came into play there. It also explores his homosexuality, the way he drugged people to make them compliant, and the way his brutality escalated.

Remembering that this movie is a work of fiction, this movie could be interesting to a number of people depending on what you want to watch. Since it is about a serial killer the topic is well-known, and if the thought of a Dahmer movie appeals to you then it appeals to you. I personally thought it was well done, again taking liberties, but that is to be expected.",1194048000,11,2889,4.750996015936255

I was glad most of the violence was implied. One scene I found interesting was where one of his victims tried to show him some compassion, and he tries to strangle him. A strange thought went thru my mind: if he'd have given anyone the chance, could he have been shown love, or was he too far gone? Every friend I ask this say it was too late, all he cared about was the control. I've seen alot of serial killer movies-I'm fascinated by Dahmer though because his upbringing wasn't exactly out of the ordinary-broken family/home, delved into alcoholism, but his dad tried to reach out to him, and he closed himself off. With as smart and as good-looking as he was, I do have a hard time understanding why he was so ignored. I give this film three stars because it is very well acted, but doesn't answer alot of questions. Rent it before buying it.

1730207,2,B00006951A,"I was actually disappointed in *Dahmer*.  I guess I was expecting the life and crimes of Dahmer.  I remembered, as a teenager, how it was such a big deal when Dahmer was arrested.  So, I was looking forward to a gruesome account of how he had came to be.  He was charged on 17 counts of murder.  However, he was actually convicted on 15 of them, totally some 937 years in prison.

Instead, like one reviewer put it, this was like ""pre-Dahmer"" and it certainly felt that way.  Plus, not everything in this film was accurate as there was a disclaimer saying so.  So, if you're not familiar on Dahmer and his crimes, then you won't know which is true and which isn't.

*Dahmer* paints this serial killer as a lonesome gay chocolate factory worker in Milwaukee.  However, Dahmer likes his men to be totally submissive.  In order for them to be submissive, he'll have them drugged and then killed.

The problem is that we don't really see how or where he murders them, except 2 of them.  We see, in flashbacks, how he seduced his (first?) victim.  Then, we see how he seduced Khamtay.  Khamtay was the only person who gave suspense in this entire film.  You see, Khamtay escaped from Dahmer's apartment and begged for help.  However, when the police arrived so did Dahmer, from work.  After some smooth talking, the police gave Khamtay back to Dahmer to his death.  Last, we see the drama between Dahmer and Rodney.  In real life, Rodney is supposed to be Tracy, who was the second and last victim to escape from Dahmer.

However, we do not see that here.  Instead, we see that Rodney is interested in Dahmer.  Dahmer is interested but conflicted.  Every time that Dahmer wanted to kill Rodney, he stopped.

So, we do not really see the real portrayal of Dahmer in this film.  Instead, we see flashbacks of his teen years and young adulthood where Dahmer struggled against the authority of his religious father.  I guess that is supposed to explain why Dahmer came to be as this serial killer.  We see his run-in's with the police but gets away with it every time.  We see how he drugged men at the local gay bar and in his apartment.  And that's just about it.

Honestly, it was a waste of time.  You're better off watching *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* just to get an idea of what Dahmer might've been like.",1171238400,,2304,4.50363196125908
1730208,3,B00006951A,"As a owner of such films such as Ted Bundy, Ed Gein, Gacy and interviews of many natorious serial killers, I must say that Jeff Dahmer is definetly the most DISTURBED serial killer to date. This movie is not a true serial killer flick. It focuses on Jeffery's lifestyle and doesn't truly explain to us the reason this man turned into a ruthless killer. Jeremy Renner does a good job portraying Dahmer in this film. You look at Dahmer and would never suspect that while working in a chocolate factory by day, he was a murderer by night. Dahmer was a loner who would pray on young men, usually dark skinned. We see Dahmer pick up a young man while shopping. Dahmer offers to buy this young man a pair of shoes with an ulterior motive. Dahmer would lure these young men to his apartment by offering then $50 or $100 dollars to pose for pictures for him. Unaware of what lied ahead, these young men would agree and once in the privacy of Dahmer's apartment, he would usually give them a drink which was heavily drugged ultimately rendering his victims helpless. We see him perform a labotomy on one victim. We also see scenes with his father. Dahmer at that time was living with his grandmother and stole a manniquen from a local store which was found by his father and grandmother in his closet. Dahmer's explanation was that it was just fun to have stolen it but we know that the manequin was used by Dahmer so he could sleep with it and fondle it. We see him go to bars where he would drug young men by buying them drinks and slipping in his deadly cocktail drug and take these young men to a back room of the bar to have sex with them while they were knocked out. This is not a bloody, gory film. At one point, we do see Dahmer hack up the body of a  young man he has killed. Dahmer would have to get himself intoxicated in order to dismember the bodies. He then puts the body in garbage bags and was on  his way to a local dump to dispose of the body when he was pulled over by a policeman who saw him swerving in the road. Dahmer was able to talk his way out of it saying that he was just adjusting his rearview mirror. The policeman saw the garbage bags in the back of Dahmer's vehicle and inquired about them but smooth Dahmer explained that he couldn't sleep and was on his way to the local dump to dispose of trash. The policeman did not search the bags and let Dahmer go. Dahmer was finally caught when one would be victim escaped from Dahmer's apartment and went to local authorities. From that point on the police went to Dahmer's apartment and found a crime scene like no other. There were body parts, a huge drum with 3 torsos in it, and remains of other victims. The smell was awful...and Dahmer was arrested and convicted of killing 17 young men and was sentenced to 957 years in jail. Dahmer does not deny anything and admits to the killings and admits to even eating some of his victims, making him a cannibal. The town of Milwaukee could now breath a sigh of relief. As we all know, 2 years after being in jail for serving a ""life"" sentence, Dahmer was killed in a bathroom by another inmate. He was beat in the head and pronounced dead upon arrival at the local hospital. This movie is worth renting because you do see the different sides of Jeff Dahmer, a man who could not stop himself from killing.",1140825600,,3318,4.298722044728435

Dahmer Review- One man 17 Bodies , 957 Years , His story is finally told. This Dvd stars Jeremy Renner as Jeffrey Dahmer. He gives an excellent performance as a teenage Dahmer and Young man. Dahmer dares to explore the truth of a man many called an abomination of nature. These Dvds are inspired by life events. This dvd will take you into the twisted personal pain that led him to do some of the most extreme cases of human cruelty. This one was well acted but i was hoping for more information at the end. The begining was great, describing Jeffrey's early years but i was hoping they would show where they found the bodies at the end and maybe a bit of the trial. But other than that its good.

Ted Bundy- Charismatic and Handsome but a monster inside. Starring Michael Reilly Burke who does a fantastic job as The young Republican Serial Killer Bundy. I almost believed it was the real Bundy. Bundy was virtually Undetectable and changed the mass murderer profile forever. Step inside the mind of the psychotic madman and ask yourself, if it were to happen again would you seem him coming?

Ed Gein- ''Before there was the term serial killer, there was ''Ed''. This one was horrific. After seeing this video I always wondered why Eddie Gein was considered one of the most gruesome serial killers in history. After all he killed only 2, which wouldn't make him a serial killer since 3 is the lucky number. Just the overall weirdness and the extremes he went to is disturbing. He is a truly unique serial killer. He is the inspiration for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho and other horror movies. The things he did and the extent of his weirdness is unparalleled by most. The story looks back on Ed's Life and contains some real clips from when Ed was caught back in the 1950's. Ed is played by Steve Railsback who gives an excellent and haunting performance as Ed. The mother of Ed, Carrie Snodgress was great as well. Noone will ever forget the True Story Of Ed Gein.

If you are looking for blood and murder, you won't find it here.  There is one puddle of blood, a pretty tame drill bit, and one flashing, bloodless cavity exploration.  This isn't a film about Dahmer's killing spree; it's a ""Pre-Dahmer"" exploration of a young man's transformation.  And even then, sorry to say, it doesn't have the ring of accuracy to those who know psychology.

What 'Dahmer' does have is some surprisingly good acting from unknown talents.  Jeremy Renner is especially good in his role of Jeffrey Dahmer, and kudos to Artel Kayaru, Matt Newton, Dion Basco and Bruce Davison.  The film is artistically directed, well photographed, well edited, and makes good use of music/soundtrack and make-up effects.  Overall, it's a very well done movie.

'Dhamer' covers Jeffrey's life prior to his 'splurge', so to speak.  It's a development study.  The script makes use of Dahmer's close run-in's with police that were blown off, like getting caught trying to return a victim to his house, getting caught drugging drinks in a gay bar, and an incident in his youth with a garbage bag in the back of his mothers car that *wasn't* grass clippings.

The movie makes strong use of flashbacks and scene-skips, but it works to an advantage on film.  Jeremy Renner plays both younger and older Dahmer, and the make-up/photography is excellent in making this work on-screen.  To some, the movie may seem paceless, but it's absorbing nonetheless.  It did seem to end too soon, too much left out; but for the time frame of Dahmer's life it did a good job.

Some interesting notes of my own would be the writer's reference to the Christian cross as a torture device, like worshiping an electric chair or a guillotine.  To a serial killer, this would make sense.  It brings up interesting social issues for a young gay man, but I honestly don't credit Dahmer with having much debative intellect.  Serial killers are normally creatures of immediate sensation, not debative thought.  They live 'in the now' and often believe that other people are simply 'items' in their world and not beings with thought processes; like them.  Others are a study, not a reality.

I strongly doubt Dahmer felt any revulsion the first time he cut, killed, dismembered, or ate any of his victims.  It would have been merely interesting to him.  In the real world, you can't use reason to reach unreasonable people.  They cannot hear it.

All in all, I suggest renting before buying, and keep in mind its more of an artistic study than a horror movie.  Enjoy!",1125446400,25,2603,4.7910112359550565

It's terrible acting and we don't see any motivations for his actions and there aren't much details of his crimes except that he met gay guys and killed them in his apartment.

The details of the time one escaped, was questioned by police, and was returned by the police to Dahmer due to his drugged up nature are widely known and the movie didn't even demonstrate the things that are pretty common knowledge let alone show anything about him that isn't already known.

1730250,4,B00006951A,"Dahmer is an in depth look at the infamous serial killer. Instead of fully depicting Jeffery Dahmer's heinous acts of brutality and depravity, Dahmer focuses on the individual alone. The film raises the commonly asked question of why? How could this happen? Why did this happen? What turned Dahmer into a serial killer? Anyone going into this film looking for the answers to all of these questions is going to be let down because Dahmer is not about answering the questions. What this film gives you instead is an ambiguous portrait of Jeffery Dahmer the man. There are no solid answers to why Dahmer did what he did, but it does give you one interpretation of what turned Dahmer into a serial killer.
In the film, Dahmer is portrayed as a loner who is incapable of connecting to anyone. Many of the scenes in the film depict Dahmer walking around in complete solitude. I think that these scenes of Dahmer are essential to understanding the movie. There is just a general sense of hopelessness and alienation in this movie. According to the film, alienation is what drove Dahmer over the edge. Dahmer is just so far away from humanity that he is incapable of being saved. No one could save him during his lone descent into madness. It is painful to watch the various people in Dahmer's life, including his father, try to connect with him completely oblivious to the fact that he is too far away from humanity to be saved now.
How does this movie hold up to the actual events? The brutality of the actual murders is toned down and sacrificed for character development, which was a mature decision on the part of the film creators. There are several changes in the storyline, too, but none of these changes are blatant attempts to spice up an already deranged/disturbed story (see Nightstalker). These changes actually do not even effect the movie's overall impact, so do not worry because the overall story of the real life murders stays intact. The movie is still very disturbing without glorifying violence too much.
Overall, the creators of this movie made a bold and mature decision to focus entirely on Dahmer the person. This is not a movie about the trial or all of the things that happened after Dahmer was discovered. This is the perfect movie for people looking for an in depth look at the mind of a serial murderer. There is not much blood, gore, and guts in this movie at all. This is not a Disney movie. This is not even a ""real horror"" movie. This is a very psychological movie that takes you into the mind of one of America's most depraved serial killers. If anything, you should be disturbed by the fact that this is based upon a true story. None of this was conjured up in someone's head; Dahmer is something that we can encounter in our own sick sad world. It is the kind of film that truly makes you question your own environment. Just how good do you know your own neighbors when appearances can be so deceiving? In the case of Dahmer, the movie succeeds to paint a portrait of a man that very few people would actually like to take a long, hard look at...",1090022400,13,3075,4.562386980108499

Jeremy Renner plays Dahmer to a T from his odd slur in his speach all the way down to his insucure hunch in his posture. While watching you may feel like your really watching Dahmer in his redlight lit bathroom ploting his victims demise. It makes your skin crawl to wonder what's running though his head as he lurks around his apartment waiting for his drink to paralyze his ""guest"".

But I stumbled onto it on TV one night without realizing what it was (during the scene in which the crow gets loose in the house) and quickly became absorbed.
No, the movie offers no answers about the real-life serial killer, it doesn't present a straight-forward biography and it's relatively light on gore.
But what it does have is a thoughtful script and restrained-but-intense direction by David Jacobson, a challenging structure (it's basically a relay race of flashbacks and flashforwards) and great performances by Jeremey Renner, Bruce Davison, Matt Newton and especially Artel Kayru as a deceptively simple boy toy.
I love a good horror movie but few contemporary films scare me.  I'd much rather be creeped out than grossed out. This one got under my skin in weird ways -- especially the scenes in which we know a murder is about to happen but... when???, or the sequence in which Dahmer's father demands again and again to know what's inside the locked box in his son's closet (and we *don't* want him to open it).
Many reviewers here seem disappointed by what this movie is.  And perhaps Jacobson should've called the movie and his main character something else if he wasn't going to make a detailed portrait of an actual person.  But that shouldn't overshadow the fact that this is a well-made, intense, well-balanced little pressure cooker of a movie.",1079481600,2,1500,4.870588235294117
1730286,2,B00006951A,"Jeffery Dahmer was a sex-serial-killer that I had read a lot about. I was eleven when Dahmer was found. I had remembered little about him -- other than he murdered and ate humans. I had read a book about him, so when 'Dahmer' was released straight to video I absolutely had to see it. After watching it, I felt sick. The film was done tastefully, gore-wise, but as far as fact-based, it wasn't really there. The story skips around back and forth, if I hadn't read the book 'The Millwauke Murders,' I would've been lost. One of my stars goes to actor Jeremy Renner (National Lampoon's Senior Trip) who did a fabulous job with the characterization of Dahmer, but the script is what fails. I understand that you can't have a picture (especially fact-based) with all the gore, due to the tragedy the families went through, but you've got to come up with something better than this. The film mostly focused on Dahmer's homosexuality and him drugging and raping innocent men. Another star goes to the plot evolving around a loving father -- who supported his son even after all that happened. Two stars is all I'm giving this film -- and even at that, I'd still avoid the film and read a book on the psyche of a serial killer.

1730288,5,B00006951A,"Jeremy Renner portrays the infamous serial killer/cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer and he does a tremendous job of humanizing this real life monster. Now before I go into a review of the DVD let me first warn all the viewers who are expecting a gorefest that you will be disappointed. THere are no references to cannibalism or any real vivid murders and very little blood. WHat this movie is really about is Jeffrey Dahmer the person. The film starts with Dahmer in Milwaukee picking up a young Asian. By this time Dahmer is already a serial killer. Then the film shifts back to the teenage Dahmer and his relationship with his father. Renner is convincing in both roles. The film brilliantly focuses on Dahmer's first murder which is the high point of the movie. Dahmer's first murder was as a teenager and his victim was a college wrestler who is hitchhiking his way to school. Dahmer jokes with his victim, feeds him, drinks with him, but then when the victim decides to leave Dahmer kills him because he can't bear to be alone. I think that basically is why Dahmer was a killer, he just didn't know how to fit in socially. One scene in particular really is heartbreaking. After his first murder he just breaks down sobbing. Renner's performance in this scene is simply incredible. He just breaks down and bawls like a child who has just lost his mom. As a viewer I felt crushed by this scene and it made me understand a little about what was behind this heinous murderer. The film ends with the teenage Dahmer simply walking off into the woods alone. His first murder complete, his future atrocities in front of him. But it is Jeremy Renner who makes this movie great, I can't think of another actor who could have done as good a job portraying Jeffrey Dahmer. Buy this DVD, don't expect blood but do expect a great performance by a very talented actor in Jeremy Renner.",1069804800,4,1865,4.586826347305389

1730290,4,B00006951A,"This is a macabre and spectacularly disturbing portrait of one of America's most reviled killers. While the film does skim over some of the more gory aspects of Dahmer's murders, it makes a very strong statement on his mental and social illnesses.
Jeremy Renner (who I first saw in National Lampoon's Senior Trip, of all things) masterfully portrays Dahmer in both a linear ""present-day"" story line and a series of very well edited flashbacks. His nervousness and almost frantic urgency while in the company of the living is chilling when contrasted with his calm with the victims post-mortem. The supporting cast is also top-notch. Through their performances we see a domineering father, a blind-sided grandmother and truly fearful and confused cast of victims.
The sets, lighting and cinematography also lend to the eerie tones in Dahmer. From the red lighting in Dahmer's bathroom as he crushes pills with a water glass, to the strobe effect in the seedy club he frequents, the audience is forced into an emotional response to each setting and the events that transpire in them.
Overall, the film does a nice job of getting into the head of a nefarious maniac. Even if it is ambiguous with a lot of the details of Dahmer's killings, it will make you think twice about accepting a drink in a bar, and wonder what the handsome, seemingly harmless boy next door is really up to.",1053216000,4,1378,4.843220338983051

If you are looking for the gory aspects of his life (not that they will ever show that in a movie, or could for that matter) then this is far from what you want.

I had not seen the film, but all I needed to know was that it was not a major hollywood movie and it was about Jeffery Dahmer. I enjoyed the Silence of the Lambs series and thought that Anthony Hopkins did an excellent job. But, what interested me about Dahmer is that it's about a real person. The film takes place in Milwaukee,Wisconsin and the opening scene shows Jeffery Dahmer looking and acting like a civilized human being while working at a chocolate factory.
 The film begins with Dahmer in prison and then flashes back to the beginnings of his murderous ways. Jeremy Renner portrays the canibalistic- necrophiliac-disturbed individual,Jeffery Dhamer, in a very skillful and realistic way. If this was a major motion picture, I can almost guarantee you that Jeremy Renner would win an Oscar.
If you are worried about the content of the film, don't be.  It does show some blood, but nothing compared to Silence of the Lambs. Also, don't be worried about scenes of canibalism or necrophilism---it only shows enough to get the point across. The film also contains NO nudity.

This movie was a stunning character portrait of a man. A human being. Not an evil methodical monster. Jeremy Renner's performance was absolutely mesmerizing. This man is magnetic on camera. And he brought such presence, and essence. Bruce Davison does a great job a Lionel Dahmer. A caring man that REALLY just wants to help his son no matter what.
And Artel Kayaru is heartbreakingly adorable as a confused, rare soul named Rodney. And I have to give major props to the man that played Khamtay. If you've seen the movie then you know what I'm talking about. this movie tries to come off as non-exploitive as possible, which is a challenge. A great challange that director David Jacobson has overcome with this magnificent drama.
The intensity that overcomes this movie is totally spellbinding. We actually want to LIKE Dahmer in some parts. Most notably the scene with Matt Newton involving marijuana. And by the end of the film all we feel is empathy for Jeffrey Dahmer. How maybe he could have been saved earlier on, and why his mind had to go in such a horrible and destructive direction.

That's not to say the film is ineffective, however. It will certainly get under your skin. Jeremy Renner's portrayal of Dahmer is especially notable for it's simultaneous blankness and inner chaos. And Artel Kayaru shines as a potential victim-the living yin to Dahmer's passive, predatory yang. But because we all know so much about these crimes, Jacobson's version often seems far too tidy and detached. I always got the distinct feeling that Jeffrey Dahmer's actual life had a little more ""Taxi Driver"" in it, and a little less Fiona Apple music video.",1043107200,,930,5.29054054054054

I understand the moviemakers intent, to make a film about Dahmer that was not gruesome and showed his human side. Well, it sort of did that, not well, but I got the point. There is no real gore, a few scenes are mildly disturbing but all in all those parts are done with a lot of taste. As far as showing a human side of Dahmer it showed a little of the self hatred and frustration that he may of felt with his sexual identity and social ineptness. The acting was done well for a low budget independent, and the cinematography and mood were actually very well put together. Unfortunately that is about all this movie brings to the table.
Cannibalism is never addressed in the film, and I think that is what most people are looking for when they rent or buy something bearing the name Dahmer. The events that lead up to, and the details of Dahmer's capture are also unseen in this movie leaving the film hanging, and not in a nail-biting kind of way, but in a ""where the heck is the rest of the movie"" kind of way. The moviemakers were not careful about removing things in the background that did not fit the time period, which I'm kind of a stickler about.
All in all the movie dealt with Dahmer's sexual and social problems pretty well, but did not really give an interesting account of his murders, or the cannibalism that you would expect to see. After watching this I was half tempted to scratch the DVD and return it saying ""uh, this was scratched, can I get a different movie"". This movie get 2 stars, and if not for the interesting cinematography it would have gotten 1. If you want a serial killer movie, Ed Gein was much more interesting, it had more back story, more gore (hey, I like gore what can I say), and an ending that did not leave you hanging.",1036022400,4,1890,4.34180790960452

I mean, it's so damned obvious that the guys/boys he brings home/meets end up hacked up for BBQ (metal fans, anyone?!) so why not work in some action, suspense, news, talk of the missing, etc.? All the movie does is show how he lured, tortured, and killed his victims, basically. Doesn't even touch on him being a cannibal. The movie has an abrupt ending, which really is it's biggest flaw. Given when the movie was made, I expected it'd touch on his hunt, capture, trial, imprisonment, and, ultimately, his demise. Very disappointing, that movie. Extremely lacking. Imagine getting dressed up in formals and your blind date picks you up for dinner in his Yugo, and you find out he's Mr. Rogers and you're going to Wendy's for dinner, when you expected opera tickets, a limo, and dinner at the Mansion. Try beating that with a greaseburger and a frosty.",1035936000,,898,4.689873417721519
1730352,1,B00006951A,"If I had two adjectives to describe this movie, it would be pointless and dumb.  They didn't accurately portray Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes. It was about a man as you know, going to bars picking up gay men, drugging them and having sex with them. All they did was have flashbacks and him hanging out with another gay man. Nothing gory, nothing exciting, biggest waste of my time.  What about the saving of body parts in the freezer? What about the eating of his victims? WHERE are these DETAILS? If the writer of this movie would like the true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, please go to A&E.com and purchase the serial killer box set. Now that is something worth your time.  When the re-write comes out with all the ""true and factual"" details, let me know.",1035331200,4,747,4.518518518518518
1730353,1,B00006951A,"Don't waste your money on this movie. What made Jeffrey Dahmer unique to other serial killers, was his methods of disposing the bodies. This movie didn't even touch base on this. Jumping from teenager to adult continuously was frankly, quite annoying. Very disappointed with the ending. Left it open, and many unanswered questions. I recently watched TED BUNDY. This was accurate, and didn't leave you guessing.",1035244800,,411,5.242424242424242
1730354,2,B00006951A,"I read a book on Jeffrey Dahmer before I watched the movie because I wanted to get a clearer insight on what had happened since I was younger around the time it took place. Unfortunately, that left me feeling disappointed. I know that movies based on real life still have a fictional element to it, but there was so much that could have been captured on film that didn't even make the screen!
The movie tends to flash back and forth from the time Jeff was a teenager, to the last night he killed, and was then caught. The reason that I gave it some stars was because the flashbacks were very interesting, and gave insight into his home life and how controlling and suspicious his father was. I also liked the conversation Jeff had with the ""hitchhiker"" after they smoked out. He was trying to convince the guy why you should be open-minded and not just follow what everyone else does. (Get a job, marry some woman, resent each other, be bored the rest of your life.) He was being very manipulative and trying to convince the guy there would be no difference in sleeping with a man than with a woman if the lights were out.
Sadly, the movie was not well focused. It mostly concentrated on the times Jeff went to gay clubs and drugged men to have sex with them. Also, it seemed that some of the information was wrong. The reason the public seemed so interested in this case was because of the cannabilism. There was only one part of the movie that included it, but it showed nothing, he just had a head in a box.
The ending was also bad.
So much could have been done with this movie!! Some parts were enjoyable because of the acting ability and the flashbacks. But other than that, not really worth it. Read the books instead.",1034812800,4,1724,4.390625

1730356,4,B00006951A,"I was very impressed with this film.  Though it fudges some of the facts in order to present a more sympathetic view of famous killer, undermining its credibility as a biography, the film works very well on dramatic terms.  From its creepy / cheerful opening sequence (Patsy Cline crooning as chocolate Santas roll off the production line) to its haunting final image, ""Dahmer"" delivers the dramatic goods while avoiding, for the most part, outright gore.
The film cleverly juxtaposes flashbacks to Dahmer's early life with the meeting of Dahmer and his (intended) last victim.  This allows the viewer to contemplate Dahmer's slide into madness, with special attention paid to the contrast between the confusion and pain of his teenage years with the seemingly emotionless monster he became.  The grim tone is leavened by flashes of black humor, but not to the detriment of the serious subject matter.
Jeremy Renner, in the title role, was excellent.  Renner really caught the flat, affectless delivery of someone who knows he's a monster, and has gone to great lengths (mostly alcoholic) to block out his sense of morality.  He got that creepy look in the eyes, the combination of ""little boy lost"" and ""great white shark"" we can see in Dahmer's trial photos.  Renner was especially good as the teenage Dahmer.  Aside from looking startlingly young, he displayed a touching vulnerability and helplessness even as he commits and covers up his first murder.
Bruce Davison as Jeffrey's father Lionel Dahmer was quite good, and came off as concerned, sympathetic, and completely ineffectual.  Artel Kayaru as ""Rodney"" (who takes the place of the real-life Tracy Edwards, who escaped Dahmer and alerted the police) gives an outstanding debut performance.  His vibrant persona provides a wonderful contrast to Dahmer's phlegmatic manner.
I did feel that the movie was lacking in several areas.  Some of the transitions between past and present were confusing, but once I clicked with the film's rhythm it didn't bother me.  Rodney's motivations were obscure - why he would return to the apartment of a man who just tried to strangle him?  The denoument was abrupt, relying on a sudden cut to the standard ""Jeffrey Dahmer was charged with 16 counts of murder..."" title card.
There was a lot glossed over that could have added insight to Dahmer's psyche.  For instance, his latchkey kid's fear of abandonment (the incident when he came home to find his mother and brother moved to Ohio could have been proved telling!).  Or his fear of castration, brought on by testicle surgery, or his fascination with dissecting animals.  Dahmer's army years, an attempt at ""normalcy"" ending with a discharge for alcoholism, may also have been worth at least a mention.
There were also many, many atrocities that were never referred to.  Dahmer's apartment was notorious for its rank odor, but neither of the men Dahmer brings home mentions this.  The vats of acid, the heads in the freezer, the painted skulls and drawer full of Polaroids are never seen.  His cannibalism is never even alluded to.  In fact, the film seemed to be at pains to portray him as less of a ghoul and more of a misunderstood monster.
Aside from the dishonesty of such an approach, as a longtime horror fan, I missed the grisly details.  With such a solid dramatic structure and good performances, I felt the filmmakers could have painted with a much redder brush and lost none of their integrity.  Unfortunately for us gore-hounds, however, the production team decided to err on the side of good taste.  No pun intended.  (Well, maybe just a little bit.)
Last but not least, I was very disappointed tbat the DVD contains only the full-screen version of the film.  This is especially annoying since the preview is shown letterboxed!
Still and all, this is a powerful film that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in madness, murder and mayhem of the cinematic variety.",1034121600,2,3932,4.9573170731707314
1730357,1,B00006951A,"Is he a man or is he a monster. After watching this flick you will be as clueless about a solution as I was. What made Jeffery Dahmer so infamouse was not that he killed people, anyone could do that. It was that he ate them and he was a homosexual.
The story revolves around Dahmer basically trying to kill this man he meets a t aknife shop.
He fails.
But in the mean time we are witness to his first kill and how his Father was such a .... We also see him kill one guy in the beggining but beyond that we see nothing. Literally the movie is about Dahmer getting stoned, Drunk, what ever, having sex with a few guys, killing 2 and trying to kill a third. This movie is so pointless and stupid that to watch and enjoy this must either mean;
A) You have extremely bizzare taste in movies or
B) YOu are blind.
Overall avoid this piece of garbage. It by no means tells the truth about Dahmer and only shows us to gay underworld. Is he a man or is he a monster, this movie can't tell you that, read his biography instead.",1034121600,2,1016,4.059701492537314
1730358,1,B00006951A,"This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I've seen.  I expected something that gave insight into Dahmer's life and what drove him to his acts.
Instead we got snippets in flashback form that give little information.
I found the format a bit confusing as it was hard to delineate when each flash back was, so it was hard to get a handle on how things progressed.
There was virtually no information about Dahmer's childhood, and what could have created such a pyscho.  And very little about what he actually did other than two short scenes depicting him cutting up what I think was his first victim, and using a powerdrill on the head of another victim.
Overall I thought this was a terrible movie, and I would never recommend it to anyone.",1033862400,3,745,4.511111111111111
1730359,5,B00006951A,"Bravo! Jeremy Renner steps up to the plate and kills a homerun!
Pardon the pun...I couldn't resist.  Check out the featurette - it gives you an in-depth look at how far Renner was willing to go in his research of his part of Dahmer and how he got every little creepy nuance of Dahmer's personality(or lack therof) and his every bizarre subtle mannerism down to an exact science.  I love the part when he's in the chocolate factory and he tells the new guy, ""this job could make you go nuts...if you're not o.k. up top."" Imagine making chocolate Santa Clauses for 8 hours/day and then on your lunch break eating them for lunch as you sit by yourself in the break room in solitary thinking of what guy you're going to get to pass on out on Whiskey and Coke(..and GHB) and then ... with a power drill, saw, and then dissect until you're bored with him.

1730360,4,B00006951A,"What's great about this movie is how it's structured.  The story almost moves backwards with its interesting use of flashbacks.  The editing is top notch [the bar scene is notable], though the pace can feel a bit slow, I think it's because you are just waiting and waiting for this explosion of Jeffery.  Tension is built up by not giving you what you truly think you want, a gore flick.  Everybody knows what Dahmer did, and knows it was horrifing and awful, 'Dahmer' focuses on the seemingly normal life of a person that you can actually relate to.  That is where this film freaks you out the most.  I also reccomend watching this with director commentary, very informative, and fun.",1033257600,,685,4.666666666666667
