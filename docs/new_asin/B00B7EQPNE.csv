5562020,5,B00B7EQPNE,We ordered this fer our bluray player app and worked great. Grandson loved sammy in part 1. He is approx. 16 months old and dosent take his eyes off it. Great movie!!!,1366329600,,167,4.25
5562021,5,B00B7EQPNE,"Life saver on  28 hour emergency road trip with baby. After 14 hours baby was so tired of  starring at back of seat and feed up with the adults trying to desperately amuse him. We met up with my oldest son whom I had given him a DVD player for his pickup as a Christmas gift and this DVD was in it. He graciously loaned us this for the return trip home and for 14 hours we listened to this DVD over and over again, but even the adults loved the music and story line. This was a keeper so much that I bought a portable DVD for each family member who has kids or would be transporting kids and bought them all copies of this DVD. It is so cute to watch, happy to listen to and keeps the baby entertained.",1508112000,,702,3.936619718309859

5562025,4,B00B7EQPNE,"this is the second sammy 3d film.  It was shown in Europe at the theaters. We did not get it here like that.  The film is a cute kids film. The only reason I bought it was for my 3d collection. The story features a little turtle having 3d adventures. 3d is very well suited to animation. And undersea animation even looks better . so even a adult can enjoy this for the 3d at least  If you have kids , they will really enjoy this one though.  It's well suited for small kids.  It's animation is much cheaper than disney of course. Sort of like animals united 3d, or jungle shuffle 3d. Two euro 3d animated films. So expect that level of money spent on it.",1496707200,,655,4.125984251968504

5562057,5,B00B7EQPNE,"I will say that this one wasn't as great as the first, but sequels rarely are.  That said, it's still a good movie and, like the first one, the 3-D effects are awesome!  Both the Turtle's Tale movies are great examples of what 'Amazing 3-D' is.  If you like pop-outs, things flying out of the screen, then you need to pick this movie up.  You won't find the first one here on Amazon, at least I haven't been able to yet (with US region coding).  You can find it on Netflix if you search for it on a 3D device (like a 3-D BluRay player).  After I saw that one I came straight to Amazon and picked up this sequel.

I love these movies not only for the amazing 3-D, but I have a real passion for the ocean and ocean life, and this movie really puts you under the sea.  It has a great message and communicates the importance of caring for our oceans and our environment.  Good story, good music, good message, great 3-D.  Pop over to Netflix and check out the first while you have the second one coming via Amazon Prime.",1461024000,3,1016,4.164102564102564

5562062,5,B00B7EQPNE,Great 3D..at least s dozen out of screen effects that are sometimes 50 % to 80% out towards you..not much ghosting..decent depth good colors..This movie is a tie for 4th on my list with madagascar 3 3D ..(Sammy's Adventure 1 a secret passage Hong Kong version) is my number 2 all time best 3D out of hundreds I've seen and own and my #1 3D movie to date is Thunder and the house of magic..note both sammy's adventures 1 n 2 and Thunder and the house of magic are from NWAVE productions. .The true masters in 3D period. No one does it better and I've seen and own hundreds of 3D movies..The out of screen effects in these 3 movies are unmatched ..Period..If your old school pop out 3d like me order all 3 ..And get them now..you will not be sorry..to bad these are the only 3 movies that Nwave have out..but boy are they awesome..wow..this is what pop out 3d is all about...,1455321600,4,873,4.296969696969697

5562136,1,B00B7EQPNE,I've never written a movie review like this but I really didn't like my children Watching a film that demonizes humans  and makes anyone who isn't a vegan out to be a bad character.  Simply too many older concepts for a young child to be introduces to. I mean come on gangstas that terrorize others and all of the loony characters on the verge of suicide?? Children's movies are usually light but this one is just sad.,1395014400,7,418,4.415584415584416

5562138,3,B00B7EQPNE,"Youd certainly be forgiven if 2010s A Turtles Tale: Sammy's Adventures slipped by you without notice.  In a literal, uh, sea of competition, STUDIOCANALs take on the oceanic talking-animal CG thing didn't make the biggest splash.  And unlike a variety of the underwater films flooding the market at the time (Finding Nemo, DreamWorks Shark Tale, The Reef (and Reef 2), Dolphin: The Story of a Dreamer, Sea Level and ultimately ending with the abysmal Legend of the Sea; I would place in that order from best to worst); A Turtles Tale was surprisingly enjoyable.  On my make-shift hierarchy, I would place the first Turtles Tale probably between DreamWorks Shark Tale and The Reef.

It was only natural then that the creative force behind the film would give it another go and on August 15 of 2012, A Turtle's Tale 2: Sammy's Escape from Paradise hit Belgian theaters.  Coming in at a runtime of 93-minutes (up from 88 for the original), the sequel picks up right where the first film leaves off with lead characters Sammy and Ray supervising the new generation of green and leatherback turtle hatchlings and their quest to cross the beach to reach the ocean.

In short an attack by seagulls, who want the hatchlings for food, results in the adult turtles collective distraction from approaching poachers.  As a result they get captured and end up on a fishing boat that deposits them in a one of the most beautiful aquariums in the world.

From here the formula actually starts to resemble classic prison break films thematically with the (admittedly adorable) hatchlings doing the best they can to assist their captive grandfathers in escaping back to the open ocean.

Interestingly while the first film spanned a period of 50-years, the sequel tells of an adventure that couldn't have lasted for more than a week or two.  Director Ben Stassen, founder of nWave Pictures, returns for this sequel but shares the director credit with Vincent Kesteloot, who makes his feature-length debut in this piece.  Perhaps as a result of this collaboration (or maybe even in spite of it), the pacing of the film isn't quite as fluid as the first.  This isn't too suggest there are superfluous or unnecessary scenes or segments that do little to advance the overall prose so much as a lack of cleverness makes itself felt in about the middle of the film that never fully dissipates by the conclusion.

It appears as though the filmmakers realized this too and went the extra nautical mile to create some interesting coconspirators in the aquarium; among these a lobster with multiple personality disorder, a bug-eyed blobfish with a penchant for playing dead named Jimbo and a gangster seahorse named Big D just to mention a few.  The bad news is even such a unique group of characters cant distract the viewer from the simple fact that, not unlike Finding Nemo, Back to the Sea and a dozen other films before it, the core of the tale is the captive characters attempting to flee a tank.  Of course, and as is becoming standard fare in these types of films, eco themed environmentalism is one of the major themes incorporated into the onscreen antics.  Big D may be the superficial villain of the piece but is quite harmless when compared to the human threats, which come in the form of poaching, imprisoning, polluting, killing, ingesting and so on.

In the plus column, the films soundtrack dazzles and makes use of a track that has been inconspicuously absent from all the underwater films preceding this one: The B-52's Rock Lobster.

All in all, the film is by no means unwatchable and theres always the possibility that youngsters will enjoy the big-eyed characters and bright background visuals.  Adults will likely find themselves glancing at their watches from the middle onward.  However, created on a very modest budget of $10-million and having grossed $69.5 mil at the box office alone, theres the very good possibility the filmmakers will have an opportunity to atone when they revisit Sammy and all his underwater pals in future installments.",1393286400,3,4044,4.8845029239766085

5562143,3,B00B7EQPNE,It definately wasn't better then the first.  My only issue with is it that within the first ten minutes or so is that it was very clear that it was a bar scene.  Pretty disgusting for a movie clearly meant for little children.,1389052800,,226,4.232558139534884
5562144,4,B00B7EQPNE,This one is a little darker than Turtle's Tale one. Little turtles have more serious problems than just growing up. I prefer the first one.,1388966400,,139,4.6

5562147,2,B00B7EQPNE,"I ordered this video for my 3-year old grandson, and hoped for a light, fun animated story about sea creatures.  I was quite disappointed when I found that it had very little story line, and a dark scary side to the ""bad guys"" that I didn't think was appropriate for a 3-year old.  After 20 minutes, I couldn't see where the story was going, my grandson seemed bored, and it was just too much villain for my taste so I turned it off.  My overall impression was that it was a very cheap knock-off of Finding Nemo, and not done well, at that.  I can't return it, so I will toss it.  I would not recommend it at all.",1385942400,3,613,4.117647058823529
