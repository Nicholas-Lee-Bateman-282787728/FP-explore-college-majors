8681210,5,B00O0WQPYY,"This film is about the journey of Jason Scott Lee, an American actor and well-known martial artist, as he attempts to pass muster at a Shaolin temple. I found it a fascinating documentary indicating the trials he had to pass learning Shaolin Kung Fu and the protocols of the temple. Clearly, as practiced and famous as Lee was at martial arts, achieving the approval of the Shaolin master seemed very stressful to him and caused quite a bit of anxiety. Will he be successful? It is the effort I found fascinating, along with the cinematography which included some breathtaking scenery along with the training at the temple. The 3-D is wonderful! I would recommend this Blu-ray to anyone interested in the subject.",1514764800,,713,4.852459016393443
