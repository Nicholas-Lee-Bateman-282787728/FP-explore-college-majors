8277450,5,B001AHJZOO,"This was a well done episode exploring the chances the Montezuma was able to pull off 20,000 murders in 4 days in Mexico City. The episode uses forensic science to explore the ways the killings could take place with such rapidity. It also goes into how Cortez could defeat Montezuma's army by using the neighboring tribes who were enslaved by the Aztecs as well as his sorely outnumbers force of 400 Spanish soldiers.",1458691200,,417,4.726027397260274
