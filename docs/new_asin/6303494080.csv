666758,4,6303494080,My tween son has recently gotten into brady bunch reruns.  I thought this would be fun to watch with him.  He loved it and I got a lot of chuckles out of it.  Jan of course is the funniest and crazy.,1499385600,,199,3.8048780487804876
666759,5,6303494080,Everything you could possibly do right when making a movie like this they did. Brady Bunch makes fun of itself before you get a chance to and you love it all the more for it. Very fun movie.,1497225600,,190,4.026315789473684

666762,1,6303494080,So this is a family that has their minds stuck in the 60's when they are the 90's right now.  How lame its not worth it,1488844800,,119,3.576923076923077

666764,5,6303494080,"Have to say this was a funny movie. Watched some the original series, and both are funny. Let's take the Brady's and put them in the 90's. It's funny cause they have their 70's outlooks in the 90's. They took some of the series plot lines and placed them in the movie. Family is at risk of losing their house due to an outstanding tax bill. Well hijinks ensues. Just watch it, laugh and have fun.",1487289600,,396,4.223684210526316

667217,4,6303494080,"I liked this movie more than I thought I would. The original series was campy, but this version puts the campy family into the nineties and intensifies the dorkiness with the nineties reaction to a family from another time. I especially liked Mike Brady who gave absolutely ridiculous fatherly advice with a calm voice and straight face. Alice was a dead ringer and Shelly Long played the dutiful mother perfectly. The kids did reasonably well. I didn't care for the lesbian student scenes or the cougar neighbor going after the Brady boys. That was much too awkward. The show is filled with sexual innuendoes, but all said as if there was absolutely nothing wrong in saying them. Fun cameos from the Monkees and two original Bradys. It's just good campy fun.",1483574400,6,759,4.801526717557252

667221,3,6303494080,I used to watch The Brady Bunch when it was on.  I was about the same age as Peter.  And I still watch it every once in awhile in reruns.  This movie sticks to the era of the show being set in the '70s  While the rest of the world moved on into the '90s.  A lot of the original cast make cameos.  And there are a lot of references in the story set to the original series.  Jan was my favorite girl in the show.  And they made her more neurotic in the movie.,1481068800,,457,3.736842105263158

667285,1,6303494080,"We did not even finish watching it because it was horrible. My kids waited until my husband fell asleep, and then we turned it off. I would give it a lower rating if I could. This is almost worse than the Hunger Games.",1478390400,2,218,4.093023255813954
667286,4,6303494080,I liked this video as the characters were a good fit for The Brady Bunch lot and plenty of funny moments within to make it good watching. But on the negative is how they go from a 70`s family living into 2000 is were they lost me and detracted from the original show. Good comedy though.,1475798400,,287,4.142857142857143

667813,5,6303494080,"This re-imagining of the Brady Bunch as a family stuck in the 70's while living in the mid-90's is spot on. Fans of the original show will appreciate the frequent nods to plots from the original series. The movie gently skewers each character. Of note are Christine Taylor's vain and slightly mean Marcia, Gary Cole's rambling, advice-filled Mike and Shelly Long's pitch-perfect Carol. Even the character of Alice is given a slight comic edge that works well with the fish out of water secondary story.

This is a fluffy and light-hearted comedy aimed squarely at a generation that watched the original TV show. If you liked the TV show, you will probably enjoy The Brady Bunch Movie and A Very Brady Sequel.

Side Note: This was one of the first movies I downloaded to my phone via the Amazon Prime Video app via my wifi network.

We had seen this advertised in the past and did not respond then to watch it. During a slow TV night, we decided to give it a try and see how it matched up with the old TV Series. We did not expect an attempt at an EXACT replica of the TV show. That is what this movie is- as far as I am concerned. They tried to exactly copy the characters, story line and outcome of a TV episode and expanded it to fill a movie time slot.
It seemed to drag on too long and the story plot took the same tried and true path as a TV show. They did NAIL most of the characters in looks and performance- so that seemed to work.
All in all- it was a comedy that had mild laughs and it was entertaining as a ""look back"" to the old days.",1438905600,,743,3.8

A little too sexual, a little too adult for a Brady Bunch movie but not too bad. The inferences and innuendo are frequent through.

The characters are good likenesses of the originals. The guest appearances by the original cast members are nice. The frequent inclusions of old show plots were a nice touch.

I was never a big fan of the Brady Bunch but I watched it enough to know the characters well and while this movie did a good job at casting actors who looked the part, they sure missed the original feel of the show.  I would think that a true fan would object to the dirty sexual insinuations sprinkled all throughout the movie.  The show sure didn't have any of that in it.  Things such as Marcia's friend being a lesbian who secretly lusted for Marcia.  Or the neighbor lady who chased Greg and Peter and made comments about their manhoods.  Or the scene where the boy is taking Marcia out and Mrs. Brady asks him if he has protection because it's about to rain and of course, being a newer movie, they had to make a dirty joke about condoms.  From my viewpoint the whole movie was almost poking fun and ridiculing the Brady's rather than being a tribute type remake of the show.  They constantly poked fun at them because they were taken from the 70s, when the show was made, to the present(time the movie was made).  Again, I was never a serious fan of the show but did enjoy it so it's not a huge deal for me but I'm surprised so many people who claim to be fans enjoyed this movie?????",1432684800,3,1232,4.208510638297873

This 1995 movie pokes fun at the Brady's wholesome and unified spirit, but also highlight their early-70's outlandishness by having the story take place in the mid-90s.

While the last act loses some luster, the rest of the film is a laugh riot if you're familiar with the original show. And who isnt? The 1996 sequel A Very Brady Sequel is just as good.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

There is practically a gag in every frame in the first 20 minutes. Many of the actors and actresses are remarkably similar to the original cast in a satirical way. In addition, keep your eyes open for cameos.  If I'm not mistaken, only Robert Reed (dead) and Eve Plumb (stuck-up) are absent.

So if you're a 90's kid, the movie is worth watching for the terrible grunge attire, mom jeans paired with cropped thermals, etc. All the typical Brady-isms are heightened and Jan's jealousy of Marsha turns to psychosis.

The plot, which combines a modern-day problem with Brady-style solutions, is wonderfully written.  Brady cameos are hilarious and on-target!  This film is such a joy to watch when one needs a pick-me-up after a hard day.  The only disappointment is the total lack of bonus features.  No deleted scenes, no interviews, not even any memories of ""The Brady Bunch"" itself.  These would have been interesting to watch.",1335916800,,693,5.133928571428571

As long as you know what the Brady Bunch is about, this movie will make you laugh all the way through.  They did a very good job capturing the 70's look and feel in the Brady home, and how everything around it instantly turns into the modern day 90's around them.

The casting was very well done as well.  All of the Brady kids look strinkingly similar to their original 70's counterparts.  Cindy will annoy you, Bobby will flaunt his safety rules, Jan will go psycho over Marcia's constant attention, Peter will struggle with Puberty, Greg will struggle with the ladies, and Marcia will enjoy being Marcia.  Mike Brady will guide the young Bradys with his deep, insightful, and confusing words of wisdom, while Mrs. Brady will say, ""You're father's right, kids!"" A few of the original Bradys even pop up in the movie through hilarious cameos.

I definately recommend this movie to all of the hardcore Brady Bunch fans as well as those who just enjoy a good, hilarious, well executed movie.  I personally wasn't a big fan of the show, but I found the movie insanely hilarious and find myself watching it over and over again.",1271721600,2,1214,4.609302325581395

The mother Carol and Mike the father played their roles convincingly (especially Carol the wife). She still has that mullet going on. But in a very cute, slightly sexy kinda way. <3

670628,5,6303494080,"Being just born when the show originally ran, I probably had last seen The Brady's back in the late 70's, early 80's during reruns on TV and had only remembered bits and pieces since then. Snippets like Bobby saving a girl from a falling shelf, orange hair and some sort of model volcano explosion. Nothing very distinctive at all. So when the movie came out in '95, I gave it a shot and didn't like it at all. It just seemed like another fish-out-of-water movie, and the jokes were of the inside type, which was to be expected for a movie based on a TV show. They just weren't funny. So I dismissed the movie (which apparently was pretty popular) and didn't even bother with it's sequel, which came out the next year.

Fast forward ten years to 2005. Thanks to the wonders of TV-on-DVD, I took another shot and bought the 1st season of The Brady Bunch and immediately got hooked. As I watched the episodes, those snippets suddenly became cohesive and the memories flowed back in. The warm, fuzzy, memories of a ""simpler"" time with the impossibly perfect family. As I eagerly awaited the subsequent season releases over the next year and a half, I held off on giving The Brady Bunch Movie a second chance until I had seen every episode again. I'm glad I did. Basically what I'm trying to say is that you definitely need to be familiar with the show, to fully appreciate the movie(s).

As I mentioned previously the movie takes the fish-out-of-water, squeaky-clean 70's Brady's and places them in the 90's. While you get your usual riffs on the culture clash enveloped in a pedestrian plot (albeit, their oblivious attitude is good for some laughs), the real comedic meat comes from the spoofing of the show. Swollen noses, squeaky voices, inner monologues, ""Marcia, Marcia, Marcia"", the life lessons, the clothes, breaking into song. It's all there in their glorious cheesiness, deftly presented by the cast, with special kudos going to the spot-on portrayals of Mr. & Mrs. Brady, Marcia, Jan & Alice. Actually Ben Stiller probably says to himself every day, ""I can't believe I landed Marcia Brady!"" Christine Taylor IS Marcia Brady. And look for some great cameos as well.

Good, hilarious fun for Brady fans. Of course after this, I just had to run out and get A Very Brady Sequel, which is even better! Incest! The real Mr. Brady! Cousin Oliver! Oh my!",1190160000,,2355,4.683574879227053
670629,5,6303494080,"Growing up `The Brady Bunch' was a staple in my house.  Sure it was all reruns but they were good reruns!  I had never seen `The Brady Bunch Movie' though until just last week when my wife suggested we watch it.  She knew how much I loved the show and was astonished that I had never seen the movie.  Preparing myself for a letdown I sat before the television and waited.  I waited for that said letdown for about 80 minutes but it never came.  In fact I'm tempted to say that there is absolutely nothing director Betty Thomas could have done to improve upon this comedy.  The cast was perfect (don't get me started on the uncanny Christine Taylor/Maureen McCormack resemblance), the script was ideal and the setting couldn't have been better.  Taking the Brady household into the 90's was one thing, but the way they did it was even better.  The film is shot like an episode of `The Brady Bunch' and the set pieces are downright identical (even down to the Astroturf which is commented on by their neighbors...Hilarious!).

The plot for this parody has the Brady's trying to raise enough money to save their home.  Their neighbor, the greedy Mr. Dittmeyer, has convinced the entire community to sell their homes but if he can't get the Brady's to sell then his business deal will fall through and he won't make the boat loads of money he's counting on.  Because of some back taxes the Brady's actually stand a chance at losing their home for good and with Mr. Dittmeyer trying his hardest to stifle any chance of success in raising the money the Brady's are having the hardest time working things out.

The kids have their own problems though.  Greg is trying to woo a girl at school but his brand of pursuit just doesn't mesh well with the 90's world he's oblivious to.  Peter is also having some girl problems, mainly because the girl that he likes and that actually likes him is currently dating the Dittmeyer's rebellious son Eric.  Marcia is trying to decide who to go to the dance with, the sweet guy who asked her first or the sex-hungry jock who asked her last.  Jan, still living in Marcia's shadow, struggles with finding her own identity and standing apart from her scene stealing sister.  The two younger children, Bobby and Cindy, are kinda just there to be there but Cindy does have this hilarious lisp that Mr. Dittmeyer can't understand, and that serves up some laughs.  Cindy is also struggling with her incessant tattling, so when she overhears the financial troubles her parents are in she debates whether or not she should tell anyone.

What's also wonderful about this film is that is rehashes some of the greatest moments in Brady Bunch history, like the football to the face and the wig Jan donned in the show (except here her wig is a little more eccentric).  This film also delves into the insanity behind Jan's inner rage against her sister which is represented by voices in her head.  The actors all do a wonderful job in getting down pat the mannerisms of the original cast which helps make everything feel authentic.  Shelly Long and Gary Cole are spot on as Carol and Mike Brady, and all the kids are great, especially the girls.  Christine Taylor, Jennifer Elise Cox and Olivia Hack are superb here.  Another standout is Jean Smart who plays Mrs. Dittmeyer, a drunk who hates her husband and lusts after Mike Brady, and it turns out his sons as well.  Michael McKean is hilarious as Mr. Dittmeyer, but he's upstaged in almost every scene by Hack's Cindy.

So in the end `The Brady Bunch Movie' is top notch hilarity that does the amazing show total justice.  I have yet to see `The Very Brady Sequel' but I'll be sure to check it out.  Here's to hoping it's half as good as this brilliant parody.",1190073600,,3728,4.572289156626506
670710,3,6303494080,"When this film was released in 1995 my local paper ran a Brady quiz.  Much to my horror I answered more than 90 percent of the questions right and was considered an expert.  I grew up with 7 sisters and Fridays nights at 8:00 were reserved for ""The Brady Bunch"".  Despite my resistance the Brady Bunch seeped into my subconsious.  As for the film, they got the right actors to play the Bradys particularly Gary Cole(absolutely brilliant in ""Office Space"" and ""Ricky Bobby""), Shelley Long, Christine Taylor (eerie resemblance to Maureen McCormick), and Jennifer Elise Cox.  The conceit of this film is that that the Bradys are living in the day-glo seventies while the world around them is nineties grunge.  My problem is that the makers of the film have kind of a cynical agenda.  They want to tap into boomer nostalgia but on the same token show their contempt for it.  There's something a little meanspirited about this enterprise despite the best efforts of the actors in the film.  They got it right for the sequel though.",1181260800,2,1026,4.719101123595506

This is a hilarious take on The Brady Bunch. Combining their 60s trends and attitude and throwing it into the present is genius. There are so many funny jokes regarding the Bradys standing out as a bunch of geeks living in the past.

The acting is superb. Every actor portrayed his or her own Brady character exactly the way the orgininal acted. Most of the actors even look like the orginal actors, especially Alice!

Now, don't get me wrong, you don't have to be a huge fan of the show to find this funny. But, it does help you appreciate the ties to the T.V. show if you grew up watching it or did what I did and watch it all the time on Nick at Nite!

670779,3,6303494080,"I remember watching this movie in the theatres. The audience was packed and I LOVED every minute of it. Shelly Long made an outstanding Carol Brady, loving wife and doting mother to six (count 'em six) children. The movie captured the classic camp of the television show perfectly down to trademark episode storylines inter-woven into a bigger story. The real stand out actors though has to be Christine Taylor as Marcia and Jennifer Elise Cox as Jan. The dynamic duo really set the stage with not only their remarkable resemblance to the characters but the way they captured even the inflections of the blonde Brady girls. It was almost like being taken back to the series. And speaking of which, several original series cast members make cameo appearances in the film, such as Florence Henderson as Grandma Brady, Barry Williams as a music producer, Ann B. Davis as Shultzy (named as an homage to her character on the Bob Cummings Show), and Christopher Knight as the school coach. And you can't miss the ever talented Jean Smart or RuPaul as the drunk next door neighbor and school guidence counselor. The drawbacks of the DVD release though is that Paramount skimped on any bonus material. We are benefited with seeing the movie in crystal clear widescreen and in Dolby sound, but there are no behind-the-scenes clips added though such material was shown on television when the movie was just released. There are no character/actor bios. There are no photo stills. There are no Brady song montages. There isn't even a movie trailer of the movie itself. There is just simply nothing added to make this DVD as special as it could have been than just the movie standing alone. In my mind, the purpose of releasing a movie on DVD at all is to provide the audience with a higher level of product than you would recieve on a standard videotape. Because the movie wasn't released with any of these I have to grudgingly give the DVD a three out of five stars. Not because the movie isn't good, because it is. It's one of my favorites. No, I gave it three stars because companies such as Paramount and others like them really should know better. The word 'cheated' comes to mind.",1055203200,42,2174,4.708661417322834

670781,5,6303494080,"The Brady Bunch Movie is much funnier than the tv series because it keeps the Bradys in the 70s, while the rest of the world is in the 90s, and plays their wholesomeness for laughs.  All the plot elements you loved in the tv series are back:  Cindy is the snoop, Bobby is Safety Monitor, Jan is the forgotten middle child, Peter's voice changes, Marcia has two dates for the dance, and Greg is singer Johnny Bravo.

Shelly Long and Gary Cole are perfect as the Brady parents.  Christopher Daniel Barnes is ""far out"" as rocker wanna-be Greg, and Christine Taylor is ""groovy"" as the would-be teen model Marcia, and Michael McKean is hilarious as the Brady's neighbor.

Whether you were a fan of the TV show or not, you'll like the movie because it pokes fun at itself.  It acknowledges that the Bradys were corny.  It's well-written and well-acted; a very funny movie you'll enjoy again and again.",1041033600,6,895,4.591194968553459
670863,5,6303494080,"In what could go down as the most underrated performace of the nineties, Gary Cole eerily channels Robert Reed's ghost to nail the most dead on imitation of Mike Brady an audience could have hoped for. At times a ridiculously over-the-top parody of the already corn-laden show and at other times a cunny and dead on satire of 70's fluff and 90's grunge, this movie is 100% brilliant. You probably did not ever expect to hear the word ""brilliant"" in the same sentence as Brady Bunch. As I am not a working movie critic, it can be assumed that i am wrong. But i must say that in the past ten years i have not laughed harder, longer or more repeatedly at any other movie than this. And believe me, i have watched it quite a few times. Taking cue from the hilariously cheesy plots of the 70's TV show and feeding from there, the Brady Bunch Movie emerges as a rather smart, and laugh out loud funny movie. The cast could not be better with, as i mentioned before, Gary Cole, Christine Taylor (in, as Marcia, the role she was born to play) and Jennifer Elise Cox (as Jan in a nuanced comic performance) being the standouts. Along with that, we were later served up an equally hilarious sequel that begs the question: Why not a Brady Trilogy. In my humble opinion, there has not been a better comedy in the past 10 years.

Hair, clothes, slang, you name it. But it is present day. The 90's. We see the two different cultures collide in a hysterical way. Shelley Long is perfect as Carol Brady. She is absolutely flawless. Gary Cole, as Mike Brady, is astounding. His voice and mannerisms are so unbelieveably Robert Reed, that it is nothing short of creepy. He is perfect. The kids are incredible. Christine Taylor as Marcia is a clone of T.V. Marcia. Right on the money. And, by the way, what a hot Marcia!. Michael McKean and Jean Smart as the neighbors are equally entertaining. Some of the jokes are sorta mean, but that's what makes it work. It's sort of making fun of the Brady's. There are several jokes and scenes that are spoofs of storylines in actual Brady episodes. If you don't know your Brady stuff, then a lot of the jokes will go right over your head. Of course, there are a number of the original cast members that pop up through the film. That was very welcome. Many people have said how stupid this film was. It's not stupid. If people think it was, then it's only because that's the way it was supposed to be. Making fun of the Brady's and their own way of the world circa the 1970's. If you call the movie stupid, your not slamming the movie. Your only praising it. That was the point. Do yourself a great favor and see this movie!. It's a hoot and a half!. Everybody have a sunshine day!.",1000684800,6,1540,4.464539007092198
670866,5,6303494080,"When I first watched this movie, I really wasn't looking forward to seeing it. I enjoyed watching the television show when I was a kid, but it wasn't one of my favorite shows. However, this film really surprised me and turned out to be the funniest movie I've seen in years.
The movie is hilarious. It parodies everything that made the Brady the Bradys (Cindy's lisp, Mike's family talks, potato sack races, etc) . All the actors have a dead-on impersonations of the original characters and make the spoof totally believable.
The major plot of the film is fairly simple. The Brady's owe $20,000 in back taxes and their beloved home is going to be sold if they can't raise the funds. Their next door neighbor is a greedy developer who wants to build a shopping mall in the Bradys neighborhood. All the other homeowners have sold, but the Bradys won't bite. The desperate developer seems to have lost, until he finds out about the Bradys' back taxes. Then things get messy. There is also a subplot revolving around Jan's struggle with being a middle child and always being overlooked by Marcia. Jan's ""struggle"" is one of the most hilarious things I have seen on film in a long time. You'll never think of hearing voices the same again (or Jan Brady for that matter).
Overall a hilarious film that parodies the original television series. The movie has the blessing of the Bradys creator (he wrote the screenplay). It is a delight for anyone who remembers the original series and even if you don't, you're sure to have a few laughs with this 70's family living in a modern world.",987984000,,1577,4.635714285714286
670867,5,6303494080,"This movie would have stayed off my radar if not for my wife's habit of watching old _Brady Bunch_ reruns.  (Stop snickering, you.  It's like a disability:  I can't help it.)  To my surprise, it turned out to be one of the best and funniest parodies I've ever seen.
While some of the actors' visual resemblance to their original counterparts is barely cosmetic, others required close scrutiny to tell apart from the originals.  Their vocal resemblance, however, is so impressive that I have to give a standing O to their hard work and self-sacrifice:  virtually all of them captured the diction, nervous habits and indeed every nuance of their original characters' behaviour with double-take accuracy.  This must have required many hours of watching the original series, which has to qualify as one of the all-time great sacrifices for the sake of the thespian art.  Even the costuming was a riot.  I counted at least four of the orignal actors (Greg, Peter, Alice and Carol) in cameos.
If you ever scoffed at the corniness of the original show--I can't resist this--you will find this movie groovy in a far-out, dreamy way.",976406400,,1124,4.873684210526315

Oh boy; you've got yourself a comedy! This silly, goofy film will  entertain fans of the series, and non-fans. Many puns relating to the  series can be found, so keep your eyes open!",963792000,,339,4.365079365079365
670869,5,6303494080,"When I first heard about the concept of this movie, I thought it was dumb-I liked the idea of a BB movie, especially since the previews looked great, but then I read I review about how the Bradys are in a ""time  warp"" and the rest of the world is in the late 90's.  When I saw the  movie, all my fears were put to rest.  In fact, some of the ""culture  clash"" scenes of the Bradys interacting with the rest of the world  were the funniest, such as McKean's character not understanding a word of  what she's saying because of her lisp, an attempted car-jack ""Well,  this is a car. But my name's not Jack!"" and Marcia's best female  friend being a lesbian with a hopeless crush on her.
There's not really  enough room to say enough good things about this movie, but here's some of  them. First, the dead-on impressions are great, especially Alice, Jan, and  Marcia, but Robert Reed is really the stand-out-he sounds more like Mike  Brady than Mike Brady, and has his mannerisms down perfect. Lots of  in-jokes and references that kids who didn't watch the show won't get but  those of us like me that did will get: for instance, when Carol kisses Mike  goodbye when he leaves for work, she says, ""See ya later, Tiger!  (pause) Tiger...Tiger...I wonder what ever happened to that dog?"" the  blackboard in the kitchen has ""porkchops and applesauce"" written  on it, etc.  They even manage to throw in a reference to Johnny Bravo. The  period detail is great including the costumes. There's some little sexual  innuendo thrown in, but it fits in with the movie and the characters  perfectly-one of the funniest scenes is when Carol and Mike think they're  alone, and she's sitting on his lap whispering what is probably something  dirty in his ear, and he's saying ""Uh-huh...You would...I see...""  exactly like Mike Brady does when he's talking to someone on the phone.  They include the popular Brady songs like ""Sunshine Day"" (always  kind of grated on me, but they do a great version in a Sears store) and the  horrible one that starts ""Clowns never laughed before..."" but  ""Keep On"" is actually a pretty catchy one. They recreate many  famous moments/plots from the show, such as Marcia's nose getting broken  (""Oh! My nose!"") to Jan's delight, potato sack races, Jan hating  her new glasses, Bobby being the Safety Monitor at school, and plenty more.  The plot (yes, it actually has one) involves the Brady family's efforts to  save their beloved home from an evil land-developer. Highly recommended,  even if you're not a Brady completist. Watch for the cameos from 4 original  cast members-the best was the real Alice playing a truck driver (hmmm,  always though Alice was a little butch) picking up hitch-hiking Jan who has  run away from home.
Most importantly to me, though this is a parody, the  moviemakers make fun of the show while still staying true to the spirit of  it and the characters. All their naivete is actually sweet rather than  annoying-Marcia wears hideous 70's clothes but carries herself like a  princess, Greg wants to make friends with the car-jacker, assuming he must  need a spare tire, Mike explains how he wouldn't sell his house for any  price because he designed it himself with love. During one scene, Marcia  and Jan go to a ""Teen Model"" tryout (Jan is instantly booted) and  the photographer/agent tells her she needs to cut her hair, get breast  implants, and lose some weight. She slaps, him horrified: ""CUT MY  HAIR?  How dare you!"" Greg's lines to pick up chicks (well, it seems  like this is his only opening pickup line) is ""Hey groovy chick.  You  look really happening in a far out way!"" are actually  endearing.
Everyone with a sense of humor and fun will probably like this  movie, and those of us who grew up on the show will absolutely love it.",963446400,19,3790,4.669195751138088
670979,5,6303494080,"As a fan of the original show, I was worried about how they would poke fun at the show, but it is really well done.  Basically, the Brady's have been picked up from the 70's and dropped in the middle of the 90's, which  provides for many notable scenes that show how much the times have changed.  For those fans of the original series, you'll see lots of references to  the original show, from the way they walk down the stairs to the songs they  sing.  The Brady's are late on their property taxes.  However, their  neighbor, who wants to buy their house for the land to build a mini-mall,  and has the tax notices.  By the time they find out about it, their house  is going to be auctioned.  The Brady's have to come up with $20,000 to save  their house.  This movie is almost a combination of the Brady episodes  ""Amateur Nite"" and ""To Move or Not to Move"".
This is  a hilarious movie.  If you are a fan of the original series, you'll really  enjoy this movie.  If you've never seen the original show, you'll still  love this movie.  And make sure to look for cameos by some of the original  cast members!",963446400,3,1108,4.276699029126213

This satire really hits the most memorable escapades. Gary Cole is hilarious as Mike Brady with all of his advice that goes on forever about tattle-tales and how people like to be corrected when they're wrong.  I have never been a fan of Shelley Long; however, her performance as Carol Brady is right on target and extremely funny.  In the early scene, she is putting sugar in her coffee and continues and continues....the cup itself couldn't hold so much sugar.  She gets the Florence Henderson performance of Carol to absolutely perfection.  Just my opinion, the casting of the 3 Brady girls is superior to the Brady sons in appearance; but, the performance gags are still added well.  Maureen McCormack definitely has a twin in Christine Taylor as Marcia.

On the other side of the fence, we finally see the often spoken of but never seen next door neighbors, the Dittmeyers.  Michael McKean as the sleazy real estate broker is hilarious.  Jean Smart is Mrs. Dittmeyer. Her scenes are brief with all the sexual innuendoes toward the Brady males as well as her final line when Larry Dittmeyer says he has the ""best news""--- her reaction is priceless.... ""the kids ran away?""

Honestly, Jan Brady seems to hold the central spot where most of the story revolves.  Her problems being the ""middle child"" combined with her hearing voices in her head seems to receive the most screen time.

They did a great job selecting a cast that strongly resembles the original, and some are almost dead ringers for their counterparts.  Christine Taylor, Shelley Long, and Gary Cole were perfect choices appearance-wise, and Jennifer Elise Cox impeccably mimics the original Jan's truck driver-like walk.
