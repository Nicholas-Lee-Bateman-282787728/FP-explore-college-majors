8105512,5,B000E3TMOI,"If you like Lucky Luke and his hapless adversaries: ""The Dalton Boys"", then you'll like this!
As usual brother Joe is stomping brother Averill, but this time in live action. Don't miss the exploding chicken hand grenades!
Simply put, if you like slapstick comedy, a-la The Three Stooges, then you'll love this!
In French with English subtitles.

8105514,3,B000E3TMOI,"Set up similarly to the two Asterix movies, Les Daltons brings to the screen another favorite European cartoon/comic: Lucky Luke and the Dalton Brothers.

Under pressure from their mother to become more infamous and well known, the Dalton Brothers, Joe, Jack, William and Averel end up in prison where they hear about a legendary Mexican bandit, by the name of El Tarlo and the magic sombrero that protects him from all sorts of bullets.  Subsequently, they break out of prison and head south towards Mexico...

As a major fan of the comic book I was a little disappointed in that the actors are not that great and the dialogues/humor could have been a lot better, but the plot, the feel, the setting and music are all pretty good.

A Monica Bellucci type actress, like in the outstanding comedy, Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra would have been perfect.

The potential for a great movie was there, but it somehow fails to take off.  A shame really...

In all honesty, I'll take the cartoons and the comic books (especially) anytime compared to the film, though if you're a Lucky Luke/Dalton Bros fan you might want to give it a try, but keep in mind it's no masterpiece.",1155340800,,1176,4.7073170731707314
