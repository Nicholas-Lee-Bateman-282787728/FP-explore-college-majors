Note: The movie is R rated, for strong Violence and Language. ( In my opinion it
deserves it,  being quite violent)

  The story takes place in the Easy-Rest  Inn,  an isolated highway stop, gas station, and restaurant effectively a cross between the Petrified Forest and the Bates Motel.
Today It is in the dubious care of two brothers Ray (a young man) and Steven (a teenager) all that remains of a family that ran the inn before an armed robbery eight years ago. In that violent opening scene, about eight years ago, the parents were murdered for a few days cash and young Steven was blinded. Ray survived, but began a secret career of crime himself.

  Presently  the sons seem to get through each day, but with fewer patrons as the small desert highway the Inn is on becomes more and more deserted. The young
males have no guiding influence, especially concerning females, and that shows in their
outlook on life.

  Now comes Marvin and Sandra, in a broken-down Caddy.  Marvin (Dennis Hopper) portrays a heavy-drinking, arrogant heel and Sandra(Lara Flynn Boyle) is a visually appealing but equally morally lacking as Marvin. They say they are on their way to
Las Vegas to be married, but their constant bickering doesnt  seem right for that.

  Both sons (including blind Steven) are captivated by the very pushy Sandra
even helping her unpack her suitcase which turns out to include a pistol and handcuffs.
Tense days go by with trouble brewing between Ray and Marvin over Sandra.
Sandra winds up locked in an empty room (plentiful at Easy Rest), Her calling the police
results in a visit from two brain-dead highway police. Other murderous events follow, heightened by the long threatened storm (to fit the books title).

7825943,1,6302463254,"I'm writing this review for the sole reason that no one else has given this movie one star.  In short, it's awful.

The opening scene - which is simply a prologue to the story - is terrific.  It's also what's contained in the movie's trailer.  But, the movie takes a steep nose dive from there, and it inevitably crashes and burns.

The reason for my poor review all comes down to one thing: the script.  The story is nothing less than preposterous, and the events and actions are wholly unrealistic.

After the prologue, the story picks up with two brothers having grown up in the off-road gas station / diner that was apparently left to the two minors to own and operate after their parents' murder.  (Huh?)  A married couple happens along (very well played by Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Boyle), and the two become unwitting victims of the brothers' attentions.  Overall, the acting is as good as the acting can be in the face of such a weak plot.  (The brothers aren't necessarily bad people, we come to learn.  Well, maybe; we're not sure.  They're just suffering from the ill effects of the brutal murder of their folks.)

Without giving anything away, though there isn't much to give away to begin with, here are just a few of the problems with the storyline:

-  Apologies are owed to Al Pacino and the makers of ""Scent of a Woman.""  In this movie, one of the brothers is blind, but he has no trouble driving a car or a pickup truck.  Even during a rainstorm.

-  A man is murdered, and his body is buried in a remote corner of the desert.  (We are also given hints that this has been habitual behavior by the two wayward brothers.)  Later, the local sheriff's deputy spots the gravesite while relieving himself in the brothers' backyard.  The gravesite now looks to be at the edge of the property, and although the body was buried in sand, it's now covered with fresh dirt, and the gravesite still has a shovel ominously sticking out of it.  The deputy says nothing of this to the sheriff as the two drive away.  To add further insult to the viewers' intelligence, the sheriff and deputy are supposedly investigating a man's disappearance when all this takes place.

-  The suspense of the story builds around a coming storm.  It's mentioned continuously as the plot moves along.  But when the storm hits, it has no effect on the actions throughout the rest of the movie.

-  The gas station / diner is an absolute pigsty.  It appears as though nothing has been cleaned, swept, or re-arranged since the boys' parents were killed ten years earlier.  But when the woman traveler decides to go for a swim, we see the pool is as crystal clear as that of a five-star hotel.  (Okay, I get that this scene gives us a chance to view Ms. Boyle in a tight swimsuit, but, if that was the intent, the resulting holes in the scene needed to be filled.)

-  There is a focus on trapping and keeping rabbits that never gets explained or developed.  It just keeps recurring for no apparent reason.

-  We learn early in the movie that the blind brother has a near-psychotic phobia about being locked in a room.  Fortunately for him - though not for the sake of the plot - it never happens again.  So, what was the point?

-  The blind brother gropes and manhandles the woman and after she is rescued, she frantically accuses the young man of trying to rape her.  In their next scene together, she catches him in her room where he's been rifling through hers and her husband's suitcases, with particular attention paid to her underwear.  The young man apologizes and asks her to be his friend.  She quickly agrees.  Again - Huh?

-  In a later scene, the woman and the blind brother are alone hiking through some rocky terrain.  (Did I mention, she claimed he tried to rape her in an earlier scene?)  Hardly dressed for the trek, she stumbles and clumsily clops on high heels along the loose stones as she approaches him.  He turns and addresses her by name, to which she replies, ""How did you know it was me?""  (Oh, come on!)

There's more, but I want to clear my memory of this stinker so I won't dwell on it any further.",1353369600,2,4116,4.4536912751677855

7825945,2,6302463254,"Director Yuri Zeltser's thriller begins well, with an opening sequence of the robbery of a desert motel, presented with little use of music, which creates tension. And the screenplay he cowrote with Michael Stewart takes an unexpected turn midway, the treatment borrowing from Psycho, with Lara Flynn Boyle placed in a world as gothic as the one Janet Leigh stumbled into. However the climax loses us, degenerating into a standard woman in peril, set against sibling rivalry, and using the hackneyed multiple resurrection device. As the sons of the Antelope Valley Easy Rest-Inn whose parents are killed in the 10 years ago beginning, Craig Sheffer and Bradley Gregg present two people as isolated from the world as Norman Bates was. Gregg was blinded in the robbery, and Sheffer is left to be the parent, though Sheffer's long hair indicates the arrested development extends to both brothers. The metaphorical storm comes via Boyle and her husband Dennis Hopper in manic mode, half funny and half cruel. The fact that Boyle and Hopper don't match up with the robbery killers (the female being Ally Walker) tells us that something is amiss, as is Boyle posed as Marilyn Monroe and a scene where Gregg attacks her in the motel's swimming pool (a nice touch for a rundown desert motel) out of rabid puberty urges. The screenplay has the occasional amusing line - Boyle says to Gregg ""Stop checking me out and check me in"", Sheffer to Gregg ""Wake up and smell the rabbit dung"", and Hopper's ""We're God's grass. We burn and he gets high"". I also like how the ""cool"" sunglasses Sheffer wears 10 years ago become the blind glasses Gregg wears 10 years later. Zeltner cuts from Hopper kissing Boyle's thigh to Sheffer hugging Gregg, and cuts from Gregg's hand in a jewellery box to Boyle's hand in hers, from which she pulls out a gun. I was sorry to see how the shift in plot meant we lose Hopper, and I could have done without Sheffer's long hair loose as a lion's mane in the climactic storm. However Sheffer handles the aging of his character well, and I liked his imitation of pain upon seeing someone stabbed in the stomach.",998870400,2,2123,4.7405405405405405
