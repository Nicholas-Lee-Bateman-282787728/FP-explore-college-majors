8724869,2,B011PYR0ES,"Being a fan of 70s Grindhouse flicks, I could easily oversell this dud by telling you it features a deranged butcher-knife-wielding transvestite, lots of gay subtext, psychedelic camera tricks during the murder sequences, copious female nudity, geriatric junkies and a do-it-yourself Caesarian section. Tempted? Dont beMARTHA is so flatly directed and shot and devoid of any real suspense or sleaze and scored in such an incongruous fashion the whole thing comes across more like a demented episode of THE DORIS DAY SHOW or any other innocuous single camera TV sitcom from 1971.

**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**
Shacked up together in suburban Florida, Paul the older of the two (and a dead ringer for Andy Kaufman) dresses up in drag as Aunt Martha to protect reckless Stanley (who looks pretty long in the tooth for eighteen; but that may be due to all the coke he snorts with bodacious blonde Barbara Eden-wannabes). The two are on the lam for a robbery/murder that the drug-addled Stanley committed in Baltimore.

Pauls cross-dressing isn't of the twisted PSYCHO sort; hes just trying to stay under the radar and its played more for comedy as he resembles those 1960s and 1970s character actresses such as Maudie Prickett or Priscilla Morrill with the sensible shoes and frumpish frocks he dons for the charade. Its quite the bizarre sight seeing the hirsute and shirtless Paul character pace around the house still in skirt and lady-loafers with his hairy chest exposed while chomping on a cigar, all man from the waist up with grandmotherly lower half.

Stanley seems to be all for peace, drugs and free love yet weirdly freaks out and calls for Paul every time a member of the fairer sex attempts to get into his pants. There is an ambiguity to their relationship as the two are seen sleeping in the same bed and its never made clear whether Pauls possessiveness of Stanley is jealousy or protection. The nudity is far from titillatingone drugged-out dancing girl has repulsive breasts that look like shriveled turnips.

The restoration of the film print is minimal; there are still issues such as interlacing and burn marks throughout but the picture looks much better than it did on VHS or Youtube.

If you're a fan, you will want it for the improved video quality and the commentary, otherwise theres not enough of anything (its not creepy enough, sleazy enough, suspenseful enough or funny enough) to make it enjoyable for fans of 70s Exploitation.
