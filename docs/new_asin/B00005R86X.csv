Their method of teaching can be funny and at times goofy but that is what gets it embedded into your memory. Lots to learn from this video! I think you will love it.",1493683200,,311,4.571428571428571
7951861,3,B00005R86X,"This is too cute for words. Where are the words?  What I hoped to get was a CD to help with basic travel vocabulary. I guess it will take me there, but there's too much other stuff that takes time to go through.",1442966400,,211,3.9069767441860463

7951864,1,B00005R86X,"This DVD is heavy on the English and short on the Italian.  It spends way too much time on the word ""ciao"" and cute skits

(mostly in English) on its pronunciation.  Meanwhile, it gives

you a very complicated set of rules (again primarily in English) for the pronunciation of vowels and consonant combinations which it whips through in blinding speed and are probably only appropriate for persons wishing to major in Italian as a career.  Its very short on vocabulary building and you will learn only a very few words of Italian and Italian phrases.  Its filled with fluff and skits which try to be cute (and usually fail) and are mostly in English.  I really cannot recommend this DVD to anyone.  You won't learn much Italian words and phrases from it.",1119052800,12,754,4.659090909090909
