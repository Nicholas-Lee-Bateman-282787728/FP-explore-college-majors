7984705,2,B00008J2G9,"This one's about a crazed scientist in a makeshift floating hospital who tries to surgically remove criminal tendencies from convicted murderers (apparently, it's a glandular thing).  When the ship's captain leads an attack on the nutty but well-intentioned doc and his quasi-medical henchmen, he's turned into a zombie.  Not surprisingly, Vic Halperin who also directed the cult fave White Zombie directed this tight 50-minute film.  Halperin adapted this macabre tale from Jack London's fine story ""A Thousand Deaths.""",1299715200,,520,5.641025641025641
7984706,3,B00008J2G9,"An overzealous doctor lures notorious murderers and other criminals (including the one nicknamed ""Poison Mary Slavish"") into a ship which is in fact chartered solely for ""curing"" them of their ""criminal mind."" Gleefully corny and melodramatic adventure film is, believe me or not, actually ""suggested"" by a Jack London short `A Thousand Deaths"" written in 1899. You may think you shouldn't be looking for literary merit of the original (which is a fairly lurid tale) in this film, and you're perfectly right. This is a B thriller, best seen as a curio in the movie history, but that doesn't mean it is uninteresting.

The film stars Lyle Talbot as Lt. Bob Bennett, captain of the ship and nephew to the Doctor Herbert Stander (Irving Pichel) conducting this horrible experiment. Watching character actors like Talbot (who is later to be seen in Ed Wood's ""Jail Bait"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"") almost makes up for the lack of actions or thrills in the film, which is directed flatly and obviously produced cheaply. Perhaps you're thinking of ""so-bad-so-good"" kind of fun. You may find some of the scenes (unwittingly) interesting, like the stereotyped images of foreigners, ineffective and unconvincing scuffle scenes and Talbot's zombie walking (I'm not kidding). In short, whether you like the film or nor depends on your taste. I think I wasn't bored while watching it for about 60 minutes, but I believe I'm not going to watch it again so soon.

The film is directed by Victor Halperin, probably known for his ""White Zombie"" shot seven years before this one. It is regrettable that unlike ""White Zombie"" he didn't make use of the ""living dead"" theme that is seen in Jack London's original short, which is still intriguing with a very curious mixture of horror and science. In fact, you don't see any ""comic relief"" or ""love interest"" in London's tale, which is still a fascinating read in its own way. As to the film, it is just OK even by the standard of film fans who are kind to this kind of cult film.",1176768000,3,2013,4.781609195402299
7984707,2,B00008J2G9,"To those who are not film buffs, this is just another B-thriller. But for those who are film buffs, this is a psychotronic masterpiece, being as it is the first picture produced by the long gone, but not forgotten, B-movie studio, PRC. (This was actually done under the direct predecessor of PRC, Producers Picture Corporation, but a financial shuffle later that year caused the change of name to Producer's releasing Corporation.)

The plot, such as it is, concerns a Doctor Herbert Stander (Irving Pichel), who believes that the criminal tendency can be cured via medicine. Being as he is indicted for these beliefs (and experiments), he buys a boat and invites every loathsome crook (With names like Harvey the Carver and Poison Mary Slavish, in case you don't already know they are evil.) to join him on an ocean voyage, where the long arm of the law will never touch them. The good doctor's nephew, Bob (Lyle Talbot, already on his way to B-moviedom. Ed Wood pictures were only a few years away.), a good and upright young man, is the captain.

Well, the doc is free to operate, but the results aren't there. Suddenly it occurs to him that it's easier to turn a good man evil than vice versa. So who does he choose for his next victim? Why Bob, of course! Meanwhile, the baddies are plotting to take over the boat. Can Bob recover and stop this nefarious plan? What do you think?

Yeah, ""Torture Ship"" has a trite and true plot, but it is directed by Victor Halperin (of ""White Zombie"" fame, has good interaction between characters, and, although a little too talky at times, runs only 59 minutes. For the psychotronic film buff, this is a must.",1095811200,4,1650,4.6438356164383565
