8515862,1,B007FORXEK,"Angry, sick and sad.  And yes, a bit mad.  (Rhyme intended)

I'm watching this concert for the first time and I am angry, sick and sad.  Don't get me wrong.  The music is fantastic.  Fabulous.  I expected as much after being a fan for 40 years.  Wonderful music.  But hey, this is like a live, video concert - right?

The video production is a disaster of epic proportions and it totally destroys what should have been an extraordinary home concert experience.  I feel like hugging the porcelain bowl.

Whoever decided to insult both the band and the audience by not spending more than 3 seconds at ANY SINGLE TIME on any shot is literally masochistic, demented, could care less, phoned in the editing and suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder.  How did this get by the Artistic Gods?

After two songs, I am literally sea sick. I'm woozy from having my attention diverted so often that I can't concentrate on anything.  (Go ahead, count each shot and see if you can find any that are longer than 3 seconds in the first two numbers)

The video production makes it impossible to enjoy watching because the viewer is not given enough time to focus on anything.

Damn.  What an opportunity lost.

To get the most out of this concert, turn OFF the video and don't watch it.  Just listen.

However, if you want to know what it feels like to be insulted by a film editor...........this concert is for you.  Of the 50 plus odd video concerts I have, the video editing on this is the most insulting I have and stands alone as the worse.  Beneath contempt.  There should be an award for this level of trash.

The irony is that Billy's music is some of the best...............period.

What a crying shame.",1431475200,4,1696,4.5514950166112955

8515865,5,B007FORXEK,"Great craftsmanship on every level.  The production, sound, and even the lighting add great elements of mood to this concert dvd.  The song selection is perfect.  It leaves you with the feeling of wanting more, but feeling very satisfied with what you just witnessed....a work of art.",1361145600,,284,5.0
8515866,5,B007FORXEK,"I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but what I have seen looks terrific.

Although the colors and lighting look great, they don't seem to spend much time with Billy. A second or two and they go somewhere else.  It seems that we don't see a lot of the cool stuff that he's doing.

I think the song selection works well.  There is a lot of stuff going on, and these outstanding musicians make it work.

If you're familiar with Billy Cobham you know what to expect - one of the best drummers of all time making it all look easy.

P.S.  This site said that there are only a few DVDs left.  How can they run low on them???  Fine jewelery I understand, but media?",1335398400,5,660,4.174603174603175
