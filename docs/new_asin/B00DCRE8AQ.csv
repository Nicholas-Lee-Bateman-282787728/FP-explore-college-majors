5791209,5,B00DCRE8AQ,Used this on a super long car ride with our 1.5 yr olds and it made the drive WAY easier. And even after 20 hrs of silly songs I still enjoy them with my kids! Maybe because anything is better than a child screaming in their car seat ;). But really these songs are so funny and clever. Very enjoyable!,1404864000,5,301,4.033333333333333

5791235,5,B00DCRE8AQ,I ordered this DVD for my 8 month old son after watching a Veggie Tales movie. He loves the singing and this was perfect for him! It has enough songs to keep him entertained and you can play all of them or they are divided up into categories. It also comes with a sing-a-long disc the only thing we did not like about it was there is not a play all option. You have to select a song each time and that gets very annoying.,1465862400,,421,3.9647058823529413
5791236,5,B00DCRE8AQ,We have always enjoyed the Veggie Tales silly songs in each movie.  We have another baby and she likes the songs as well.  This DVD has hours of silly songs.  We love it!,1464825600,,170,4.090909090909091

They are perfect for children and you don't have to worry about what your kids are watching and if it is or isn't appropriate. They are definitely silly songs that kids love, but clever enough that adults will get a kick out of them as well. I'd definitely recommend this fun DVD! Appropriate for all ages!",1441065600,3,429,4.512820512820513

5791287,4,B00DCRE8AQ,"I would have gladly rated this DVD 5 stars but had to go with a 4 instead due to technical points only. It would have been nice if a ""resume playing"" or ""chapter search"" function had been included. Since neither are featured, this DVD starts back at the beginning every time it's been turned off then turned back on. My grandson has yet to see the last several songs even though he's watched it many times. That being said, my family has enjoyed Veggie Tales for a number of years especially all of their Silly Songs!! There's a good chance Mom or Dad will catch themselves singing along too!",1437609600,,592,4.440366972477064

5791292,3,B00DCRE8AQ,"My daughter loves Veggie Tales and we own a ton of the DVDs. This one was pretty irritating, because it does not have a ""play all"" option. My daughter is only 3 and still hasn't figured out the remote, so I have to walk into her room every 3 minutes to play the next song. If she didn't love the songs so much, I would probably have sent the movie back.",1425340800,3,353,3.9859154929577465

8591984,4,B00DCRE8AQ,"My son loves veggie tales and loves music, so I love being able to just play all the silly songs for him! However I do have a problem with this DVD. Sometimes when I click the menu button on the remote to skip past the commercial at the beginning, and then click the ""play all"" button from the main menu, it takes me back to the spot in the commercial where it left off. It doesn't always do that but it's so annoying when it does!",1477612800,,431,4.023255813953488
