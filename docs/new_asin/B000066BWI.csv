1712480,5,B000066BWI,"Ani's first concert film is a great collage of concert footage, commentary on her political views, and private moments in ""Mr. DiFranco's"" life. As a fairly recent fan of Ani, I was beyond thrilled to buy this DVD. With live versions of Dilate, The Slant, My IQ, and Two Little Girls, to name a few, this film is truly a great selection of Ani's music.  She plays guitar with a tiger's ferocity, and her views on the death penalty and corporal punishment are quite insightful and poignant. Definitely a must-buy if you're a fan of Ani!",1029628800,6,535,4.572916666666667
1712481,5,B000066BWI,"Fans of Ani Difranco know that her art is a moving target and therefore a simple live concert video, though highly satisfying, would have fallen short of the promise that the title of her latest masterpiece puts forth.
""Render - Spanning Time with Ani Difranco"" is exactly what we want: a glimpse into her world that adds color and depth to the stories and emotions expressed in her music. In it we are treated to real life moments and given a sense of the camaraderie between the artist, her band and especially, her fans.
This is demonstrated best when, during a live performance of her song ""Dilate,"" she stops and respectfully requests the fans not sing along. After the song's completion she takes the time to explain why she made the request. Artists rarely display such confidence in their audience and she is rewarded for her willingness to take such a risk: the fans love her even more for it.
""Render"" also shows us some of the behind the scenes activities of her record label, road crew and includes a sequence documenting the editing and mixing process in the recording studio.
Not to mention some potent interview scenes where Ani lays down some of her views of America. At a time when we are being sold a party line that we are all in it together, she steps up and points out the many ways in which our society has become frayed and that we have strayed from the promise of our roots. And in so doing, she challenges us to change it.
It's a winner all around and it's why we love her!",1028246400,13,1498,4.470802919708029
1712482,4,B000066BWI,"Although I'm a long-time fan of her music, I only recently witnessed firsthand the Ani-mania that accompanies her live concerts when I saw her play in April. The kind of energy that prevailed at her concert comes through strikingly well here, both in the intensity, funk, and humor of her performance as well as the (overwhelming!) hysteria of some fans. If Ani seems annoyed at some points in the film (as another reviewer suggests) it's probably because she is. Most of us would be under the circumstances--after all, Ani's only human, and the film reveals precisely that. She's just a woman with a guitar and a voice, and she wants to play.
  But the film has a voice that's not confined to the ranks of chords and performances. It's a voice of social consciousness that addresses racism, politics, and a whole range of ""cultural soul-searching"" issues. And it's all packed in an artsy documentary format, insisting that this is way more than an adorned glorification of our folky friend. It's unpretentious and fun...and the music is OK, too;) Watch if you get the chance...you'll laugh, you'll cry...",1027728000,17,1105,4.903743315508021
1712483,5,B000066BWI,"Awesome....Awesome....Awesome, a must have for all of us who worship the folktress or have a general appreciation for her music.",1024099200,2,128,5.45
1712484,1,B000066BWI,"i have to agree with the post from WA. i was totally let down by this dvd. I purchesed it for a friend for her birthday & HAD to watch it first( because we were such huge Ani fans). and well, not only was i let down by her obvious drug use, but her attitude toward her fans. many people love this woman & are moved & touched by her music. many women [hear her music & it helps them through their day] and i know she is tring to break free from what everyone makes her out to be, and that is what was so wonderufl, but this, this was a let down. Ani do you thing, but i won't be following in these foot steps.",1106611200,3,608,3.795275590551181
1712485,5,B000066BWI,"i just had to respond to the review by Odessa from Texas.

first of all the woman's name is ""ANI"" not ""ANNIE.""

secondly, if this dvd is a diatribe (critisism) of Ani's political beliefs

why would she agree to be filmed?

you say that the film would be better

if Ani ""made her points in her songs""

because you're tired of ""being preached at""...

so you don't find it at all commmendable

that the woman can write amazingly insightful

and thought filled music about what she believes in and,

still ""preaches"" it even when she's not performing???

would it be better if she muted her opinion

(which you say she's entitled to) when she's done recording???

does ""talk the talk, walk the walk"" mean anything to you???

so you don't care what she believes in unless and only if she's singing about it???

i gave this 5 stars even though i haven't seen it...

pretty much to make up for odessa's review.",1102118400,4,903,4.481481481481482
1712486,5,B000066BWI,"People often chasitze Ani Difranco for being too preachy of an aritst. I find that funny when the majority of songs that she creates are the reason that we all are fans of her. These songs have the same message she mostly talks about in Render, so I assume it's that most of Ani's fans only like to hear her opinions when there is a guitar playing along. I don't think that's fair.
With Render, Ani Difranco takes you into what she experiences by touring with her band. You see her extended family, and you see her diligent work ethic and devotion to her craft. It's a film showcasing her and her beliefs, so if people cannot accept that, then they shouldn't have bought the DVD in the first place. After all, the DVD says directly Spanning Time with Ani Difranco, not Ani Difranco live in Concert (although I would be excited if she ever decided to release a DVD of that stature).
Also, I personally like most of the songs on the DVD, to the person that called them B-Sides. In fact, My IQ is one of my favorite poems by her, and Overlap is one of my favorite songs. Besides, the most important thing about this DVD is the overall impression, which I think is shown very well. Regardless of wehether or not you agree with her politics, this DVD shows them well researched and in a manner that is obviously just her voicing her opinion based on the things she's learned. To the person who said ""why does she say don't judge people for their worst moment in their lives."" I didn't see you complaining about the song ""Fuel"" on Little Plastic Castle, so I don't know why you're suprised she's against capital punishment. You get to get inside the mind of Ani Difranco, a compelling mind at that.
And while I don't agree with her not liking people to sing along at her shows, if you've been to her shows the people sometimes get out of hand and distracting. She's not a popstar, she's a folk singer so we don't want to see her dance and put on a circus like extravaganza. We want to hear her play, therefore Ani is valid for not wanting distractions so that she can do her best job live. I've seen her twice; she doesn't disappoint!",1077926400,12,2128,4.376262626262626
1712487,1,B000066BWI,"Remember the days that we traded Ani's overdubbed cassettes on  college campuses? Most of Ani's fans watched her grow from the beginning.  It's too bad that she only sees her sing-a-long fans who are crazy about her music as a distraction.  What she had to say about this on the video made me sick.  I try to turn my head on the arrogant superstar persona Ani has decided to display, but there's not much else on this video.  Ani Difranco is still the most dynamic singer songwriter in the industry today, but this video will not give you a good impression of her act. Save your money for when she comes to your town. Sorry Ani, but you're beginning to remind me of the late 1990's Stevie Nicks explosion. One gold star for effort.",1041638400,11,731,4.425373134328358
1712488,5,B000066BWI,"This movie gave me chills. How lucky we are to be given a poetic insight into the life of one today's feminist, political geniuses. Hilary Goldberg's (sp?) fluid and candid shots were beautiful to follow. Thanks to two fine women for an incredibly comprehensive project- I look forward to more!",1033689600,,294,4.9
1712489,5,B000066BWI,"Even the most casual fan knows that Ani does one thing best: authentically be herself. She's not a silly pretty girl star, she's not a politician, and she ain't gonna water it down. She's Ani Difranco, plain and simple.
This video will give you that. If you want to know a bit about what inspires, moves, and sets this little folksinger to writing - this is where to find it. It's a brand new take on Ani having her say in the world.
If you are a compassionate Ani Difranco fan, excited to see what she's put down and not necessarily what you'd like her to produce, you will totally dig this film. If you have your own agenda or expectations, you might be disappointed... but that's a story that's been told before where it concerns this righteous babe.",1033516800,,753,4.424460431654676
1712490,1,B000066BWI,"...I felt completely ripped off when I bought this DVD.
It is well over 60 percent NOT MUSICAL PERFORMANCE!  You'll hear songs, see bits of the performance of said songs, but it's more like a collage of many other things during it as well.  I don't like conversations and commentary while a song is playing, thank you.  These collages are like the collages you see of a TV sitcom character who just died off and played in slow motion while the credits roll.
Although I like everything behind the scenes of what's going on, I like these things balanced with the music...
On a final note, when Ani talks about not believing in the idea of having to move to New York (as in City) to ""make it big"", even the most hardcore fan who knows anything about her should know that's pure baloney; she didn't move there to go to college and start a career in an office job while doing open mic nights in her spare time as a hobby.
I still love Ani and her music...And don't buy this if you're looking for the amazing thrill of her shows.  Even the songs you do see performed are not her best; they're more like the B-sides.
Stick with a concert CD or better yet AN ACTUAL CONCERT.
That's a wrap.",1032393600,6,1181,4.306306306306307
1712491,1,B000066BWI,"Horrid,useless. Fine for hanging on your rearview mirror. I believe all are interested in concert footage or Ani singing. Sorry,not here. The brilliant thought from Ani concerning capital punishment"" Why should we judge a person on one small moment of their lives"". You know, like when they killed someone,DUH! Absolutely pathetic!

DeFaltay's an author whose works are worhty as this. Hygeeine's important and should be taken care of: Animal takes off her shirt. Lovely breaSts!

7962148,3,B000066BWI,"Ani DiFranco is a masterful musician.  Her vocals are raw and honest, her guitar skills are hard to match. Each one of her songs has been crafted by a composer and lyricist whose talent is undeniable.

The DVD only slightly captures Ani as a musician. Perhaps the medium just can't capture the essence and energy that permeates her live performances.  Or, perhaps it's the constant interruptions that, instead of providing quick insightful tidbits, only acts to distract the viewer from the music.

Instead, the DVD seems to be more an experiment in film making - almost an expos, if you will, about who the artist is.  The DVD isn't about music at all, in fact.

Which leads me to why I titled this review ""not what I expected."" The DVD could only be about the music if Ani, herself, was really about the music.  I'm sad to say that, after viewing this, I'm not sure what Ani is about. The attitude she projects toward her fans is less than positive and her personality fluctuates between control-freak, perfectionist to pot-smoking, hippie.

Mind you, I've got nothing against pot smokers, hippies, control-freaks or perfectionists... but, if I wanted to watch a DVD about any of them, I'd buy a drama, not a music DVD.

If you have a positive image of Ani, then please don't buy this DVD. This film does little to support that image and, instead, makes you think that, just maybe, you didn't know her at all.",1169164800,,1411,4.657258064516129
7962149,5,B000066BWI,"Ani does things her way and this movie is just another example of that fact. It is forthright and honest and some people just can't deal with the reality of that. To see, Ani talk about everything from Racism to Feminism is moving and inspiring. She is not just some pop musician who you can nod your head too and listen for the next poppy beat. She is the social conscience of a generation and this was a glimpse into her life story not a MTV video. The criticisms made here are ignorant because the movie is meant to make you feel real emotion and not just a sterile artist on a stage performing. You are supposed to have an epiphany that not everything is golden in the land of gold and you are supposed to feel motivated to do something to make it better. So, if you are looking for mindless dribble this is not your kind of movie this is a movie for those who really like art, politics and music.

It doesn't have a format because it is not just a concert movie and it is not just a social commentary documentary. It is something in between the two and quite a nice little experiment. Ani is can be a harsh reality for people who are not enlighten and some people might not like the politics because people like THOMAS EDWARDS exist and they can't understand when Ani states"" murder is murder whether by a person or government"" or some might be offend by Ani pot smoking but not the useless drug war which locks up thousands of people each year and waste millions of dollars. So, if your looking for a heroine buy the Render DVD.",1137283200,2,1534,4.289655172413793
7962150,5,B000066BWI,I was worried at first after reading some of the negative reviews but decided Ani deserved the chance. I love this DVD because it is more intimate and not just another concert. I cannot stand what is on commercial radio these days which is one of the reason I like Ani and I really like this effort. This is not for those of us who are just looking to be entertained.,1130112000,,367,4.183098591549296
7962151,4,B000066BWI,"if you're looking for a concert DVD, skip this and pick up trust instead. but if you're looking for insight into the force known as ani difranco, then this is a great overview. along w/ some great live performances (my fav being a lovely version of ""overlap"" w/ a guest guitarist), there's lots of backstage, home-y footage, inc. a nice sequence where we see the song ""slide"" take shape and another where we see her mixing a song for a live recording. a real draw to this DVD is getting to see ani in many of her non-songwriting aspects, including her political interests, her role as producer and record label head, and her just plain goofiness. the DVD also includes a track from each artist on her label at the time. yes, a lot of the camera work is clearly amateur, but it helps add to the overall experience w/ its immediacy and friendliness, combining to give you a great picture of ani as a person. prob. not for casual fans, but a lot of good content. p.s. what's w/ the overreaction to the pot-smoking scene? she's not doing crack for pete's sake!",1128902400,5,1056,4.476683937823834
7962152,4,B000066BWI,"I like everyone else, heard Ani for the first time from a friend and immedatly fell in love with her fast acustic guitar, razor voice and lyrics, and strong messages (feminism, political activism...ect.)  And once you are an Ani fan, you really become an Ani fan.  You spend every pay check on C.D.s and music DVDs to get a little closer to the tough independent folk singer.  And everyone wants to know what Ani is going to sing about next.

I picked up ""Render"" because of the previously stated comments above.  I read other reviews on amazon, and I'll tell you the truth to the very biased reviews.  (They are either I LOVE IT or IT SUCKS!)

First of all, this DVD is more of a documentary than anything.  If you want a concert of Ani, I suggest you get ""Trust.""  It goes into Ani's life on the road with her friends and what not.  You get to see many Righteous Babe Artists preforming and chilling with Ani.  (Best scene is with Bitch and Animal...total sexism)  Each scene is a song that Ani is preforming, but in the prefomance, is clips of her hanging out.  Ani speaks her beliefs on politics, feminism, homosexuality, capital punishment, racism...ect, everything Ani writes and sings about.

The review that said Ani was mean to her fans and said she was a druggie, is not really true.  Ani tells her fans, not yells at her fans, for singing along with her music because her music is a very emotional experience for her, and for the fans to sing along and make it into a ""scoccor chant"" is a bit degrading to her art.  (As a poet and writer I understand.)  Also, Ani just smokes a joint and makes a joke about it.  Not that big of a deal, but it does get me wondering about her song ""Come Away From It"".....hummm.

So in the end, if you LOVE Ani like H-Core style, get ""Render.""  It's not a concert, but an artistic documentary with concert tid bits.  If you like Ani's music, but don't really care to watch her hang with friends for 2 hours, don't get it.  Just go out and get ""Trust.""  This is for H-Core Ani fans only.",1123286400,5,2029,4.352
7962153,5,B000066BWI,"i don't normally write reviews, but i think people are being very unfair about ""render...""

i bought this dvd because an old friend once said ""this woman is incredible"" & sent me a cassette of difranco's ""living in clip."" i was amazed. she had an energy i had never felt before, her lyrics were intense & she didn't shy away from topics that are considered taboo like so many other writers trying to keep an audience. her honesty & just plain raw skill amazed me from the start, so i had to see her live when she was in town. again, i was blown away. since then i've bought at least 10 of her cd's, & the trust dvd is on the list next. i watch ""render"" at least once a month & every time find something that i didn't notice before that makes it strictly an ani experience. if you go in expecting a concert disc, you will be disappointed. but if you go into it wanting to learn something about her as a person, performer, & political activist, as well as the people behind her that put so much into the experience in the background, then watch this. overall it's definitely worth seeing, & the songs are great (overlap is my favorite, followed by my iq, & the song with sekou sundiata a close 3rd.) definitely one of my favorite ani experiences.",1118188800,7,1244,4.316239316239316
