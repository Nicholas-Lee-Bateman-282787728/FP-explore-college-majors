Ramsey's claim to fame is to take anyone off the streets and turn that person into an executive chef. His style is similar to boot camp. He breaks you down in order to build you back up. If you are weak, get out of the kitchen now. Ramsey's preference for swearing is not calmed down during this series. This DVD is unedited so you can hear everyone first hand. If you want to see some excitement in the kitchen, this is the program to watch. If you do not like excitement then do not get this product.",1210291200,5,636,4.055555555555555

3098802,4,B0012U9IN2,"First off, let me start by saying that I have followed Hells Kitchen since episode one, and it's now in it's fourth season, so it's an honor to get to revisit the show.

Contestants:

1. Michael - Tattooed chef with experience
2. Ralph - Arrogant and can't take defeat
3. Jeff - The wimpy crybaby
4. Dewberry - The large gay male who can't handle much
5. Andrew - The loud mouth of the bunch
6. Jimmie - The clumsey oaf
7. Elsie - Ramsey's pick, started with no culinary experience
8. Carol anne - Never worked in a kitchen
9. Mary Ellen - The quiet mouse
10. Jessica - The lesbian headhunter
11. Wendy - The know it all who knows nothing
12. Chris - The arrogant cocky male.

Ok, lets start with some pros.
Extras - I'm suprised a show like this has them. Altough most of the extra's are made during season 4, they are really wonderful. From the HK tour, to Chef Ramsey's take on each of the contestants. The artwork is wonderfully done. We have a shiny, glossy slip cover that fits over the case with the same art. Another pro, the series was perfect for three discs, we are not going to the menu, and find 2 episodes on each disc, but 4.

Cons :(
The theme song has been changed to an annoying tune that I'm not a fan of.
The extras, although great, are very minimal and are over way too fast
I also hate the package type with 2 overlaying discs on one side, and the third on the other side. You must also remove the discs to read the episode synopsises.

On the Fence
The menu design, we have one menu that displays everything. No episode selection screen, well except for on the main menu
The video quality. I know this was shot with a camera, but they could've cleaned it up a little bit.
The audio track. I was planning on watching this with the family, but we only have the uncensored track.

So, if you have the series from Fox, and don't worry about extras, don't pick this up, but if you're an extras buff like me? Pick this up.

If you want a truly enjoyable food show, watch Iron Chef, where real talents battle for what is actually worth something: a better tasting meal.  I didn't see one talent on ""Hell's Kitchen,"" last night, only the absence of thought and the creation of yet another horrible, culturally destructive show.

3098806,5,B0012U9IN2,"I first saw Gordon Ramsey on BBC America and became hooked. Read about him in one of Anthony Bourdain's travel books (forgot the title) and smartacre Tony rated him as the best chef in Britain. That's high praise coming from the King of Snark. When he came to America to torture newbie chefs with their eye on the prize I had to watch. (Add to it that one of his sous chefs, Maryanne, was an acquaintance of a friend of mine. She got her gig wearing a ""I hate Rocco Dispirito"" tee shirt. Gordon recognized a kindred spirit.) If you haven't seen Hell's Kitchen, settle in for some high flyin' F-bombs and the meanest boss since Scrooge. But Gordon fights the good fight not for himself, but for his customers. It's all about the food and the paying customer. He makes grown men cry. He's had several pass out. He turns women chefs Hillary Clinton-tough. But he also paid the untrained but spunky cook from the Fried Chicken & Waffle House way through culinary school. Anybody who's seen him with his family on Gordon Ramsey's F-Word knows deep down inside he's a softy. I wouldn't want to work for him, but I'd love to eat his food. His commitment to fresh local ingridents made simply & carefully speaks volumes about him. I'm saving up for a night at his NYC restaurant. First NYC, and then Merry Olde England. A former soccer player can't be all bad!",1253145600,,1352,4.5
3098807,5,B0012U9IN2,I can't get enough of this show.  I wish the other seasons were available for purchase.  Season 6 is already coming to TV on July 21st.  I watched season one back to back with my sister.  GREAT SHOW....,1246233600,,202,4.2368421052631575
3098808,5,B0012U9IN2,"This is just a great series! I was watching like 3-4 episodes a night, and always couldn't wait to watch the next one! Yes, Gordon Ramsay may be abrasive in some people's eyes, but you have to understand, when those who work under him are screwing up, and it's his rep on the line, he's gonna get irked (anybody would)! The DVD's are great (I experienced no problems of any sort at any point), and I enjoyed watching the interviews on the extras (very informative). The DVD's also arrived fast, undamaged, and as advertised. I love watching Mr. Ramsay work, and I can't wait for more of his stuff to come out on DVD!!!",1245888000,,618,4.4298245614035086
3098809,5,B0012U9IN2,"I view this more as a documentary than a reality show.  It seems to me that this program is a biography of the contestants as it allows viewers to know their backgrounds, motivations, seriousness, intent, how they handle criticism and pressure, peer pressure, developing friendships, team vs. individual effort, blaming others for their failures, not recognizing their own faults, and as fewer contestants are left introducing family and significant others.
  As for Gordon pushing them too hard and/or his criticism of their performance, take note of what happens when pressure is exerted.  They lose concentration and stop working as a team.  What will happen if they own their restaurant and all the pressure lands on them and only they must be responsible for quick and accurate answers?  As Chef Ramsey has said again and again it is his reputation on the line for everything that is on this show and eliminating all but the single-most best ""cook"" for head chef and a tremendous salary at his/her restaurant is a sobering obligation.
  Perhaps, in my opinion, one of the highlights of this 3 disc DVD set is the bonus features.  Whether or not you have seen Hell's Kitchen, watch the interviews of both Gordon Ramsey and Arthur Smith.  These will give you the real behind-the-scenes look at a truly great show.  You will truly learn much of what I have attempted to describe above.",1243641600,,1387,4.909871244635193

Unfortunately, unlike some DVD's, this one does not give you the option of watching the uncensored version.  My 6 year old loves watching Hell's Kitchen with my husband and I, so I ordered this DVD, but didn't realize it only had the uncensored version on it.

3098818,5,B0012U9IN2,"The drawback to this DVD was the lack of subtitles.  I found that I sometimes had a hard time keeping up with all the dialog, made more difficult with Gordon's British accent, causing me to rewind quite a bit in order to catch everything.  Also, I was disappointed with the change in the Hell's Kitchen theme music, but I understand that they could not come to an agreement over the music rights, so they had to change it.  The good part is, this is truly entertainment at it's best! When the narrator explained that Gordon does not like it when customers come to the hot plate to politely complain, that was putting it mildly!  You won't believe what he says to them.  Sincere apologies?  Not so much.",1213920000,,702,4.488188976377953

3098824,4,B0012U9IN2,"I only discovered Hell's Kitchen as season two was beginning and it immediately became the only reality TV show that I ever made a point to keep up with every week.  I'll admit that it's the sheer spectacle of watching the victims...er...contestants survive my idea of hell, working in a restaurant, while attempting to meet Chef Gordon Ramsay's exacting standards that keeps me glued to the tube when this show is on.

Here's the short list of what I love about this show.

First, there's Chef Ramsay's license to abuse people, within a context of course.  The context being that one of these people will win a huge prize that they in all liklihood would never obtain on thier own: their own fancy restaurant.

I look at it like cooking boot camp.  Sure, the contestants are being continually cursed and screamed at.  Of course, we see many hours of real time condensed to a relatively few minutes each episode, so I wonder just how intense it looks ""real time"".  I guess we'll never know, but it's for a purpose and I assume they knew what they signed up for.  There's just something about a frantic, frazzled  amateur chef being cursed over messing up the risotto that I find hilarious.  How difficult is risotto to make, anyway?

Second, it's a cooking show that really isn't about cooking at all, but about working as a team in a ""fish out of water"" (and into the frying pan) kind of situation where there's fire, smoke, steam, and screaming.  How do normal people react in stressful situations?  Some rise to the occasion and discover greatness in themselves while others are exposed for the arrogant blowhards that they really are.

Third, those wonderful obscenities!  Wow, when I was watching this show I was fascinated by just what Gordon Ramsay could be saying when they bleeped him out.  What could it be?  Well, with this DVD it's all there, so if you like to hear the ""f word"" derisively spoken and screamed with English flair at people, you'll love this show.

Seriously, Chef Ramsay uses obscenities so much they become routine and cliche (except I'd imagine if they were directed at me!).  You'd think by watching this show that all Chef Ramsay does is glower and scream at people, and it's a shame that his BBC show ""The F Word"" is not so easily accessed here in the states.  You really get to know Chef Ramsay on that show.

Fourth, on this DVD you don't have to suffer the commercials.  A Hell's Kitchen episode is about 40 minutes long.  Even with the show recorded it was annoying to fast forward through all that stuff.  It's fun to just kick back and bask in the heat of Hell's Kitchen without having to reach for a remote every few minutes.

All in all, a reality show that I am thankful isn't reality for me.  The only time I worked in a restaurant I was a dishwasher and I broke so many dishes I was fired after three days.  I've done my time in ""hell"", and now you can too!",1212019200,8,2901,4.516314779270633

His commitment to fresh local ingridents made simply & carefully speaks volumes about him. I'm saving up for a night at his NYC restaurant. First NYC, and then Merry Olde England.

3333304,5,B0012U9IN2,I can't get enough of this show.  I wish the other seasons were available for purchase.  Season 6 is already coming to TV on July 21st.  I watched season one back to back with my sister.  GREAT SHOW....,1246233600,,202,4.2368421052631575
3333305,5,B0012U9IN2,"This is just a great series! I was watching like 3-4 episodes a night, and always couldn't wait to watch the next one! Yes, Gordon Ramsay may be abrasive in some people's eyes, but you have to understand, when those who work under him are screwing up, and it's his rep on the line, he's gonna get irked (anybody would)! The DVD's are great (I experienced no problems of any sort at any point), and I enjoyed watching the interviews on the extras (very informative). The DVD's also arrived fast, undamaged, and as advertised. I love watching Mr. Ramsay work, and I can't wait for more of his stuff to come out on DVD!!!",1245888000,,618,4.4298245614035086
3333306,5,B0012U9IN2,"I view this more as a documentary than a reality show.  It seems to me that this program is a biography of the contestants as it allows viewers to know their backgrounds, motivations, seriousness, intent, how they handle criticism and pressure, peer pressure, developing friendships, team vs. individual effort, blaming others for their failures, not recognizing their own faults, and as fewer contestants are left introducing family and significant others.
  As for Gordon pushing them too hard and/or his criticism of their performance, take note of what happens when pressure is exerted.  They lose concentration and stop working as a team.  What will happen if they own their restaurant and all the pressure lands on them and only they must be responsible for quick and accurate answers?  As Chef Ramsey has said again and again it is his reputation on the line for everything that is on this show and eliminating all but the single-most best ""cook"" for head chef and a tremendous salary at his/her restaurant is a sobering obligation.
  Perhaps, in my opinion, one of the highlights of this 3 disc DVD set is the bonus features.  Whether or not you have seen Hell's Kitchen, watch the interviews of both Gordon Ramsey and Arthur Smith.  These will give you the real behind-the-scenes look at a truly great show.  You will truly learn much of what I have attempted to describe above.",1243641600,,1387,4.909871244635193

Unfortunately, unlike some DVD's, this one does not give you the option of watching the uncensored version.  My 6 year old loves watching Hell's Kitchen with my husband and I, so I ordered this DVD, but didn't realize it only had the uncensored version on it.

I found that I sometimes had a hard time keeping up with all the dialog, made more difficult with Gordon's British accent, causing me to rewind quite a bit in order to catch everything.  Also, I was disappointed with the change in the Hell's Kitchen theme music, but I understand that they could not come to an agreement over the music rights, so they had to change it.  The good part is, this is truly entertainment at it's best! When the narrator explained that Gordon does not like it when customers come to the hot plate to politely complain, that was putting it mildly!  You won't believe what he says to them.  Sincere apologies?  Not so much.",1213920000,,702,4.488188976377953

3333321,4,B0012U9IN2,"I only discovered Hell's Kitchen as season two was beginning and it immediately became the only reality TV show that I ever made a point to keep up with every week.  I'll admit that it's the sheer spectacle of watching the victims...er...contestants survive my idea of hell, working in a restaurant, while attempting to meet Chef Gordon Ramsay's exacting standards that keeps me glued to the tube when this show is on.

Here's the short list of what I love about this show.

First, there's Chef Ramsay's license to abuse people, within a context of course.  The context being that one of these people will win a huge prize that they in all liklihood would never obtain on thier own: their own fancy restaurant.

I look at it like cooking boot camp.  Sure, the contestants are being continually cursed and screamed at.  Of course, we see many hours of real time condensed to a relatively few minutes each episode, so I wonder just how intense it looks ""real time"".  I guess we'll never know, but it's for a purpose and I assume they knew what they signed up for.  There's just something about a frantic, frazzled  amateur chef being cursed over messing up the risotto that I find hilarious.  How difficult is risotto to make, anyway?

Second, it's a cooking show that really isn't about cooking at all, but about working as a team in a ""fish out of water"" (and into the frying pan) kind of situation where there's fire, smoke, steam, and screaming.  How do normal people react in stressful situations?  Some rise to the occasion and discover greatness in themselves while others are exposed for the arrogant blowhards that they really are.

Third, those wonderful obscenities!  Wow, when I was watching this show I was fascinated by just what Gordon Ramsay could be saying when they bleeped him out.  What could it be?  Well, with this DVD it's all there, so if you like to hear the ""f word"" derisively spoken and screamed with English flair at people, you'll love this show.

Seriously, Chef Ramsay uses obscenities so much they become routine and cliche (except I'd imagine if they were directed at me!).  You'd think by watching this show that all Chef Ramsay does is glower and scream at people, and it's a shame that his BBC show ""The F Word"" is not so easily accessed here in the states.  You really get to know Chef Ramsay on that show.

Fourth, on this DVD you don't have to suffer the commercials.  A Hell's Kitchen episode is about 40 minutes long.  Even with the show recorded it was annoying to fast forward through all that stuff.  It's fun to just kick back and bask in the heat of Hell's Kitchen without having to reach for a remote every few minutes.

All in all, a reality show that I am thankful isn't reality for me.  The only time I worked in a restaurant I was a dishwasher and I broke so many dishes I was fired after three days.  I've done my time in ""hell"", and now you can too!",1212019200,8,2901,4.516314779270633

The cooks in this first season of Hell's Kitchen are hilarious and have no clue at all on how to run a restaurant let alone cook in one,but thats where Chef Ramsay comes in and whips them into shape. Chef Ramsay is hard on them, but he's only trying to bring the best out of the cooks. Plus there's alot of moments as well, when you see Chef Ramsay as a really cool, laid back guy when out of the kitchen.

8247850,5,B0012U9IN2,"There are many reality shows on television now and some are just standard fare while others truly rise above.  Project Runway is one of those and perhaps the best and most intense is Hell's Kitchen.  This is a show about cooking and filtering through the 12 aspiring chefs week after week to get to the TOP CHEF who gets to run his own restaurant.  What differs here is the extent of Ramsay's participation in each episode.  He is not only there to judge after each challenge but actually walks the contestants through every step each week as he helps them learn the skills necessary to be a succesful chef.  He is there to greet them in the morning, there throughout any and all challenges, there to judge and there to truly mentor.

Gordon Ramsay is a premier English chef and many find his demeanor and foul mouth a little crass and maybe a gimmick.  I can tell you that if you watch this season from beginning to end you will see that neither is true.  He speaks honestly without being cruel but acknowledges that sometimes the truth hurts.  As the show progresses you see how much he truly invests into these inspiring chefs and tough love is the only way to wipe an aspiring top chef of possible bad habits and train them with essential skills.  Many you think will fall early hold strong and others egos get in the way.  But rest assured.  There is much drama here and we get to know much about the contestants but this is about cooking and producing a master chef.  Ramsay takes the contestants on a spellbinding journey and you the viewer will only gain respect for the sincerity of Ramsay and how he puts his heart 100% into these people.  He drives them, expects perfection and not surprisingly achieves it.

To see the show uncensored is a hoot and brings the reality of the show that much more to life.  To see as the season progresses how Ramsay forms his own special bond with the contestants is priceless.  He is a master chef providing his knowledge.  Ramsay is a real guy - passionate and dedicated and it takes this 100 fold to dedicate yourself to trying to train 12 aspiring chefs.  This show is hugely addictive and I am thrilled that season 2 is coming out on dvd next week.  With Kitchen Nightmare's as well as this Gordon Ramsay is providing viewers with much enjoyment and education on the realities of food and cooking.  Highly recommended.",1273363200,8,2367,4.522352941176471
