I only wanted it because the region 1 American DVD didn't have the Spanish language and subs on it, so I ordered this copy. Different region might be a problem but luckily I have VLC player on my laptop which is region free. Also thankfully my PS3 is also region free so I'm glad it works. Totally worth buying but the video clarity looks to standard. It almost look like a pirated copy which is not. I don't know if that's because is standard quality and it doesn't go very well on HD or the place in Mexico where it is made don't make good video qualities DVDs, I don't know what's going on, I didn't have that problem with my Region 1 American version. But that's only in like maybe the 1st third and you get used to it. Not HD but it's good quality. Only buy the DVD if you wanna watch it in another language or if you have any player that's region free or accepts the region numbers as described on the product.",1481846400,2,1028,4.196969696969697
