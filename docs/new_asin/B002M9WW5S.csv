8373722,5,B002M9WW5S,Great to see this classic actor again in some of his best roles!  I especially love Never Say Never Again and A Bridge to Far.  Sean Connery never gets old and his movies get even better with age.  This is a handy package collection at a good price!,1276992000,,249,4.145833333333333
8373723,4,B002M9WW5S,"A collection that includes NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN, CUBA, A BRIDGE TOO FAR & SHALAKO.  The first, Connery's swan song as 007 -- an independent remake of THUNDERBALL.  CUBA is the best of the lot. Directed by Richard Lester it sets Connery as a British mercenary in Cuba as Castro closes in on Havana.  A BRIDGE TOO FAR is a star-studded epic in the mold of THE LONGEST DAY (and also based on the book by Cornelius Ryan) about the ill-fated Operation Market Garden.  Besides Connery you have Michael Caine, Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, James Caan and a host of others (look closely as Reddford briefs his men prior to Nijmegen bridge assault and you see will John ""Cliff Clavin"" Ratzenberger.  SHALAKO, based on a Louis L'amour novel, cast Connery in a western that also boasts Bridget Bardot, Stephen Boyd and Honor Blackman.  Weakest of the lot.",1257638400,7,845,4.714285714285714
