5788292,5,B00DC5K2J4,I missed the first episode on PBS and was very pleased to be able to access this online viewing via Amazon.,1379462400,,107,4.142857142857143
5788293,5,B00DC5K2J4,"I love many British Series.  I don't know it it's because my mom was English, but I love the conversation and the scenery.
This is a well acted, very enjoyable show.  I can't wait to watch more.",1379462400,,194,4.216216216216216
5788294,1,B00DC5K2J4,"Hoping to find something uplifting or at least amusing, I suffered through the first episode valiantly.  I could not find one redeeming quality.  Ugly, boring, trashy people also have a right to love but do we want to watch them?  I don't want to know any of them personally so why would I want to bring them into my home on a Sunday night?  Please, please remove this series from my viewing history as I will try and remove the first episode from my memory.",1379289600,11,458,4.352941176470588
5788295,5,B00DC5K2J4,"Dialogue, plot, great acting! we're starved for shows like this.
what a joy to watch. will not miss an episode",1379203200,3,110,4.55
5788296,1,B00DC5K2J4,"I had no idea there were viewing regions with DVDs...so I bought something I cannot watch.  My fault, I guess.",1379203200,2,110,4.5
5788297,5,B00DC5K2J4,"I just saw the first episode on PBS affiliate GPB Georgia. It was fantastic! I became a fan of Derek Jacobi during the Brother Cadfael series years ago. He's every bit as good now in a totally different role. The other cast members are excellent and the multiple plot lines interesting, to say the least. This new series should be thoroughly engaging, judging by the first episode. I can hardly wait a week to see the next one. I will definitely buy the DVD if my expectations are realized.",1379116800,47,490,4.51685393258427
5788298,5,B00DC5K2J4,It's charming without being cloying. Funny and pointedly tart. It has real deal sarcasm and multi-gen story lines. We'll be watching Episode Two tomorrow.,1379116800,,154,5.458333333333333
5788299,5,B00DC5K2J4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this ""episode"" of the ""series."" The episode was so refreshing: no violence, no blatant sex. Where is the rest of the series. It so rare to find good wholesome viewing and this leaves me wanting more.",1379030400,,220,4.666666666666667
5788300,1,B00DC5K2J4,"I would love to provide my review of this dvd, but can't.  Alas, I purchased it, not paying attention to the 'region'.  I tried to play it today (after having saved it for the 'perfect' weekend) only to discover that it cannot be played 'in my region'.

I understand that Amazon has made note of 'region', but how many people pay attention to that?  I have purchased many dvds from Amazon, and never had to contend with this issue.  I'm hoping it will work in Canada when I go.

So - buyer beware - pay attention to 'region' when purchasing a foreign DVD!",1378598400,3,555,4.339805825242719

5788307,3,B00DC5K2J4,"I have loved Last Tango since season 1.
I felt like this two episode special really missed the mark.
It just felt disjointed and all over the place.
We needed more Alan and Celia for starters.
And the whole saga with Eddie in the barn?  Can Gillian just be happy for once?
And come on with Caroline.  Is she always to be unlucky in love?
Just too much misery and too much happening.  The play, the barn, the move....
Get back to the basics of our beloved show.",1521244800,,460,4.204545454545454

5788310,4,B00DC5K2J4,"I caught a few parts of episodes on PBS, then found the DVDs at my local library. There are only 20 episodes, but each one is nearly an hour, not the usual American 38-43 minutes. It's been a pleasure watching Alan and Celia, their daughters, and all the twits and twats and the pillocks and the plonkers who make their lives so interesting. I agree with the critics who found that the final two episodes didn't live up to the rest of the series. I wasn't wild about the theme song, but the show often featured beautiful background music. The buildup to the wedding at the end of season 3 was the funniest pre-wedding routine since Rhoda Morgenstern had to take the New York metro and run through the Bronx to get to her own wedding.",1519084800,,733,4.397058823529412
5788311,5,B00DC5K2J4,heart warming story well acted and written. Many British programs are a little lacking but this is not one of them,1518739200,,114,4.476190476190476

5788313,2,B00DC5K2J4,"I loved Seasons 1-3 of this series, although I finally tired of the characters John and Gillian.  Nicola Walker is such a brilliant actor- how sad and infuriating it was to watch her saddled with a character written as relentlessly self destructive and stupid. The story lines and writing were excellent until the Christmas Specials 2016 that ended the show.  What a disappointment...shallow, boring, a very poor send off for this series.  Susan Wainright must have been preoccupied with writing for another show.",1517011200,4,513,5.156626506024097
5788314,3,B00DC5K2J4,"The program is superb. The version is very limited, only for region 1 and subtitles only in English. I am refraining myself to buy the continuation of the serie because of that.",1516838400,,177,4.5625

5788316,2,B00DC5K2J4,"Waste of money and a waste of our time watching it. Why? Why did they get back together to create this? It's rubbish and could have been so much better, they had a couple of good story lines going and then just dropped them like they ran out of time, not only in production, but in planning. YAWN. And the conclusion left us totally dissatisfied and and going? uH... what was the point of that?",1515628800,,394,4.266666666666667

5788328,5,B00DC5K2J4,"As close to a perfect television show as can be.
Sally Wainwright is an endlessly astute and creative writer. Nicola Walker as Gillian is a breathtaking revelation, and among the most intelligent, compassionate embodiments of a character I have ever seen.
Sarah Lancashire is also completely marvellous,
The sweetness of David Jacoby and Anne Reid's characters' romance makes one's heart sing, and
Even the stranger occurrences throughout all the seasons ring true.
It's a priceless jewel of a show.  We are crazy for it here in the States.",1487462400,,540,5.136363636363637

5788331,5,B00DC5K2J4,"So well written! Love the characters as well as te cast. Something is always going on, there are multiple story lines and none of them are boring or mundane.  It's all about love, elderly romance, middle aged self realization, young adults and teens. It's about babies both planned and not, it's about mid life changes, it's about the courage to love who you really want. Kudo's to Sally Wainright, I absolutely love the way she writes lives for the characters she creates. And the choice of actors could not be better....tese folks are so talented and bring their charaters off the page all their humanity. Waiting for season 4 to be released in Feb 2018...already on order.  Buy it!",1484870400,3,684,4.739495798319328
5788332,5,B00DC5K2J4,"Great British Series!  Ostensibly, about a late life romance between a widow and widower living in Yorkshire, but it involves the lives of both of their families with their many complex problems.  This is a ""feel good"" series.",1484352000,,226,4.921052631578948

5788384,5,B00DC5K2J4,"This show was recommended to me because it stars Sarah Lancashire, who was so wonderful in Happy Valley. This series begins as the story of Alan and Celia (played by Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid), both in their seventies and widowed, who have not seen each other in 50-odd years. They adored each other as teens, but each unbeknownst to the other. They reconnect via Facebook and find that the attraction is still there. Last Tango follows their romance and engagement, and gradually integrates the multiple storylines involving their respective dysfunctional families. The relationship between Alan and Celia is absolutely charming, and beautifully acted. Jacobi scarcely has to say a word, his emotions are written all over his face. Few actors can do that.

One caveat: the first couple of episodes are not really indicative of the tone of the series. It starts out as a very light, whimsical comedy-drama, with cute, clever parallel-story devices employed to introduce you to each family. Things don't stay light and whimsical. Both Alan and Celia have adult daughters (played by Sarah Lancashire and Nicola Walker, both excellent) who have serious family and interpersonal issues. There is a lot of angst and conflict further into the series. I think it's likely that there will be plenty of viewers who love the beginning romance, and are disappointed at the dark turn of events after, and probably as many who think the love story is too light and fluffy, and---if they don't stop watching after one or two episodes-- will prefer the family drama.",1445212800,,1552,5.015503875968992

5788392,5,B00DC5K2J4,"Took me 3 episodes to totally fall in love with this show, but then I was head over heels. The characters are real, fake, funny, flat, alive,  flawed, make stupid mistakes, get mad over things in the wrong way, change their mind to the right way, etc.  just like every human alive, especially every human in a relationship. The newly weds are just a part of the show, it is the families that make it all so well rounded for a show. And having step- families, even if the kids are in their 40's is always difficult in the beginning. No exception here, but despite the difficulties and they are varied in ways that will surprise and entertain you, they also embrace each other in such a way that is so real!

Season 2 & 3 are even better!!!

Mad crazy, good show, cannot wait for series 4 to come out. And I now want to go and visit Halifax GB! It looks stunning!  This show has made me laugh, cry, roll my eyes and smile.",1442361600,,920,4.204545454545454

5788414,1,B00DC5K2J4,"I  started out really liking this show due to the love story of the older couple.  Season one was enjoyable until the final couple episodes wherein the whole show seemed to blow up and turn from a relaxing story to watch to one that began to jump from one drama after another.  As one reviewer commented - it began to smell of 'soap opera'.

My chief complaint wasn't the soap operaness of the it all but the fact that as the series progressed into season two it was portraying adults who were parents of 3 young teenage boys between them as being totally self-absorbed/selfish without any hint of responsibility to their children.  When the story line moved into the two women wanting to have a child together, ""because I just want to be someones mom"",  I began to have serious doubts in regards to the show ever resurrecting itself to solid ground again.  When I found myself wanting to scream at the actresses that there were already 2 teenage boys on board who needed mothering why on earth would they ever consider bringing another innocent child into the sordid mess of their lives I knew I had had enough....Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Caroline, the mother of the 2 boys,  main motivation for having her lover move in with her was centered around her attempt save her home since her cheating husband had just been fired from his job and could no longer pay his part of the house payments and she didn't want to have to sell the house....Oh, I forgot to mention the husband didn't I?  For those who find these types of story lines enjoyable, you will just have to watch the show yourself to find out all about him and his flings.....

The entire premise of this series was on the love affair of the older couple. Unfortunately their story rapidly dropped by the wayside with the advent of season two..  They, and the teenage boys, were the only age appropriate people in the cast.

Save your money and enjoy shows like Downtown Abbey, The Anzac Girls, or Call the Midwife.

I do not find watching adults acting like teenagers entertaining.",1438214400,5,2051,4.555858310626703

5788459,5,B00DC5K2J4,"You could say that this series is a study in the most stressful life events that anyone can endure: if it can happen - it does happen! What makes the series such a winning formula is not only how its characters cope but the humanity, even when behaving abominably, with which each reacts to the others' misfortunes. Central to all the mayhem is the story of the septuagenarian lovers, Alan (Derek Jacobi) and Celia (Anne Reid), whose teenage crush survives six decades, their marriages to other people and the birth of their own families, only to be rekindled by the `magic' of the Internet!

It cannot avoid melodrama but the interwoven stories of the lives of the two families are told, by scriptwriter, the excellent Sally Wainwright, with such knowing warmth and delivered, by a superb cast, with such `sure-footedness' that one is held captive; laughing one moment - crying the next! Jacobi and Reid are sheer magic and the marvelous Nicola Walker's portrayal of Alan's daughter, Gillian, is heart-wrenchingly authentic.

In a word, brilliant!",1422489600,,1048,4.982857142857143

Not so, unfortunately. This series is written more as a soap opera than anything else. If you're a devotee of the LGBT movement, then you'll love the tormented blonde daughter/headmistress that's in love with one of her teachers. But the drama/comic ratio is about 95/5, if not higher. It's like a geriatric ""One Life to Live"", but with overcast outdoor settings in the exterior scenes. Don't get me wrong, Doc Martin had plenty of drama, but always served with a slice of that wry wit that we expect from a good British production.

If Eastenders was too urban for you, and you have enough tissues and comfort foods at hand, then by all means, tune in. Meanwhile, we're waiting for the British TV execs to wake up and smell the Earl Grey in their pot and give us a meaningful, relevant, even educational, series set  in Yorkshire.

Season one sustained itself on the idea that old people (no, dear, not ""the elderly"")(Up in West Yorkshire they call a spade a spade.)  not only have needs and wants, just like everyone else, they also have memories and unrequited hopes, and handicaps. Yes, still able to enjoy sex and (pills, not drugs) and rock and roll. This first series, as long as it is focused on two very fine and perfectly cast actors is a delight.

If the story had remained focused on the two older people, I would have enjoyed it more.  Why is it that homosexuality is pushed on so many shows anymore when in real life we never have to watch this stuff?  Someone compared this show to All Things Bright and Beautiful.

So many of the storylines here are about transgression and redemption--on the most intimate, domestic scale.  How we hurt the ones we love--intentionally, accidentally or un-knowingly, and we, in turn are hurt.  How do we learn from their/our mistakes?  Can we forgive them?  Can we forgive ourselves?  Sometimes the smallest acts have impossibly over-sized consequences.

But this family is growing and connecting.  If not for the dad and mom and their very distinctly different families, they never would have spent time together in another world.  Even now, they don't always like each other, but they are beginning to like and love each other.  Caroline's husband is such a dipstick to use his words, I believe.  But, still, there is a vulnerability about him that even his wife feels sorry for him sometimes. And she's trying  to divorce him!

The characters, including the endearing elderly lovers themselves, are not always nice but oh so very human and real.  As their children's lives become enmeshed we just lose ourselves in their stories and it keeps us engaged in wanted to see how everything turns out.  Superbly acted and some gorgeous scenic views of northern England, Last Tango in Halifax is an entertaining, never disappointing series that one hopes will encourage a third season but that is if everyone survives the second season.

5788599,5,B00DC5K2J4,"The story is fresh, people (the two grown daughters) make shockingly wrong decisions, say terrible things, then make up for it -- sorta like real people.

I was really happy to see Nicola Walker again, up and about and in a far more interesting part than she played forever and died in in MI5. I liked her in both. She is completely real, loose and exceptional as an actor, with far more range here as Gillian.

The actor who played her counterpart, the grwn daughter and headmistress of a posh high school, a 'big blond' named Caroline, also has some great lines and throws herself into them with crashing aplomb.

These are all modern people. There is a lot of driving (from house to house 40 miles away), seeking of parking places, everyone with a cell phone. No one (except one unfortunate moment) has homophobia, racism or sexism when they might have shown up in another family. The three boy teenagers are great, likable and good actors -- I miss them all and look forward to seeing them next time.
The grandfather, played by Derek Jacobi, is perfect as a witty, good person who speaks in a fetching Yorkshire dialect.

The only misstep, I think, a downer, is the wrong turn one character takes beginning in the second to last episode. It is psychologically unlikely and extreme compared with the rest of the series. She makes up for it in the last scenes but not enough to remove the bad taste from my mouth. (What were the writers thinking?)

In all, this series is intelligent, au courant, and seamlessly produced.",1400112000,,1523,4.625925925925926

I saw the first ep and almost decided not to watch the rest.  (That would have been a poor choice.)

Much has been said of the old age pensioners who finally get together after six decades but to me the real charm is how the minor characters are handled.  I'm thinking specifically about the Paul Jatri character, who is a complete jerk at first but after an incident that leaves him helpless, in pain, and with nowhere else to turn, starts to redeem himself.

5788622,5,B00DC5K2J4,"This story takes place in Yorshire, Northern England. While it rains quite a bit the countryside is beautiful. The main characters are Alan and Celia who were at school together and had liked one another. Life got in the way seperating them for sixty years and by chance they happen to meet on Facebook. Leading to them rekindling their friendship and romance. There are a few twists and turns long the way though!

They have adult children and grandchildren who are facing their own challenges. Celia's daughter Caroline has been a closet lesbian for over twenty years feeling she needed to conform to society's and her parent's wishes. While she did her best to love her husband he is a bit of a pill who went of with another woman, only to return home when things didn't go as planned . It is very refreshing  to see Caroline being true to herself.

Alan's daughter Gillian has her own problems having lost her husband some ten years before who was an alcoholic and took his life.

While these storylines may appear depressing they are just about a group of people living life. The humor by far outshines and doom and gloom. There were parts I laughed out loud literally! I loaned this series to a girlfriend and she loved it so much I let her keep it so I've ordered a new copy for myself. It may seem a little extravagent but I loved this series so much!!

An excellent cast, with nobody hogging the limelight. The plot kept me on the edge of my armchair, crossing my fingers and saying ""oh no!"" from time to time.  I kept hoping it would be neither a gloom-and-hopelessness Dying England affair, nor an easy all-is-resolved-fairy-godmother jaunt.  It is neither!

My one reservation is the unfortunate Judith character whose alcoholism and loose-end life is directed more as comedy than tragedy or drama; the actor cast in this part is herself an impressionist, and something of this comes through in her playing.

Nicola Walker and Derek Jacobi make a remarkable daughter-father pair; her face challenges every time she is on the screen.  Jacobi manages to mix elderly softness with inner determination, something we don't see much of in conventional TV shows.

5788652,5,B00DC5K2J4,"Last Tango in Halifax expresses amazing honesty in response to life.  It is a refreshing look at aging, and aging parents.  It is a fun look at sexuality and homosexuality.

5788654,5,B00DC5K2J4,"Why, oh WHY, can't American producers reach the level of quality and entertainment that BBC shows us year after year?  Last Tango In Halifax is poignant, funny, serious in turns.  It deals with families in transitions, with every day problems.  Most especially, it deals with senior citizens falling in love, and how their families and society deal with it.  The seniors, for the most part, deal quite well with it.  Loved season 1.

5788679,5,B00DC5K2J4,I bought this for wife as she loved it when it was on PBS.  We will probably watch the whole season again over the holidays.  I would suggest this for anyone with a sense of family.  The love story between these two 70+ year olds is something you certainly don't see every day.

5788680,4,B00DC5K2J4,"& A whole lot of melodrama! A woman and man who were attracted to each other as teenagers meet again after 60 years, immediately fall in love and plan to marry . . . sounds so uncomplicated. Since the kernels of human relationships can be boring (think your life), the plan is complicated by life, family, generations, secrets, & anything else TV writers can come up with to keep us interested. Still, heartwarming, often truly touching, & you always are routing for Celia & Alan's relationship to survive!",1387497600,,506,4.761363636363637
5788681,5,B00DC5K2J4,"I mean...what's not to love? Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid...they really do have a nice on-screen chemistry. The family dynamics are interesting and more real than most shows will allow, so it definitely lends an air of authenticity to the trials and tribulations (not to mention hilarity!) that they endure. Well done!",1387497600,,316,5.096153846153846
5788682,5,B00DC5K2J4,"In spite of all the real flaws each of these people have they are driven by true love for one another and the desire for the happiness of the other family members.  The way they dealt with the heavier yet real life issue of admitting one's homosexuality to one's family is a model for all people in ""real life"" to use.  And the writer's ability to understand that we all need time to accept things in our own way is just amazing.
But that is not the main line of the story, just a sideline like in life.  The real theme of the movie is family; accepting them for who they are with humor and love.  Amazing writing and acting in this movie.  The main couple are pensioners (old people) and yet their love relationship is every bit as relevant and important as young love.  More of this show must come to us soon!",1387411200,2,811,4.233766233766234

5788702,5,B00DC5K2J4,"With a bleak but effectively used backdrop of Nova Scotia, Halifax, this film is a wonder. The everyday types of characters are so well fleshed out that I felt I have known one or all of them at one time or another in my life, the good ones, the bad ones and the ugly ones. It is definitely a superb example of all aspects that makes movie viewing worthwhile. The director, actors, writers, production set all come together in a way seldom seen, lightning in a bottle it is. Alternatively sad, gritty, charming, humorous, witty, moody and melodramatic, it can only be described by me as thoroughly memorable and entertaining. As I own the DVD collection, I intend to give the series a repeat viewing. Believe me when I say, this film is a sure-fire winner!",1385251200,2,756,4.5661764705882355

These are shows that I will want to view over and over again.  I can't wait for the next season!  The storyline is beautifully crafted by intertwining the stories of the respective daughters with those of the two principles.  Yes, it is about a man and woman in their seventies rediscovering each other after 60 years, but it is so much more.  It is also about their respective daughters, coincidentally exactly the same age, and their complicated relationships.  The characters are as rich and complex as the locations wherein the stories unfold.  You will find that you cannot view just one episode at a time!",1384819200,,785,4.8059701492537314

They make the best TV. I re-watch these episodes often. I can honestly say I love every single character and I don't say that often. I still have my favorites though. They are Alan (a good man), Gillian (a complicated woman, rare on TV), Paul (hilarious!) and William (So sweet! Probably the most mature of all of them and he's a teenager.).

5788729,5,B00DC5K2J4,"I bought the British DVDs from amazon.uk since I missed most of the series on my local PBS. I was not disappointed in the least. All the actors are exceptional and the story is filled with many touching moments and several very humorous situations. I like all the performers but Nicola Walker is one of my favorites. I first saw her in MI5 ( or Spooks) and she was fantastic. This show is similar to ""As Time Goes By"" but in a more serious vein. There is a dark side to some of the characters whereas As Time Goes By was for the most part upbeat. My only reservation is that the ending seemed to leave some plot lines unfinished but I read on here that there will be a second season which should clear up everything. I thought that might be the plan and I am thrilled to hear about another season and hopefully many more. If you like British shows, most of which are superb, you will like this one, just the right mix of humor, drama, and some very quirky characters.",1383004800,,967,4.260869565217392

5788733,5,B00DC5K2J4,"Last Tango in Halifax is one of the most charming romantic comedies I have seen. I am smitten; Bravo Sally Wainright!  It took me a bit to determine why.  My answer: the six episodes are full to bursting with tender moments - every possible combination of a better foot forward, an open heart, a kind exchange - despite the messy, dysfunctional underlying storylines which provide humor and poignancy as a vast display of human being-ness is made available to us by Sally Wainright, writer and creator.

Sarah Lawrence as Caroline knocked my socks off with her acting - what a range.  She delivers a performance right up there with the usually stand-alone Meryl Streep. She is so convincing in her scenes with Nina Sosanya it is hard to believe she doesn't swing both ways.  She conveys aching vulnerability, delicious humor, imperious self-confidence, and a devastating sadness - through her eyes, her body language, her voice inflections.  When her mother rejects her when she announces her love for Kate, the pain she conveys is breath taking. Sarah is warm, funny, sad, sexy, upper class, lower class, exhausted, frisky, academic - she brings it all.

The rest of the cast is of the same excellent caliber - perhaps with fewer fabulous speeches (Sarah has a plum part in Series 1).  Gillian is wonderful.  She, too, has an acting range that evokes compassion, humor, and a very believable down-to-earth element as she pulls the clutch on a jeep or hoists hay for her sheep (although one has to wonder how she got off on such a wrong path with a father like Derek Jacobi).

Perhaps the most challenging character is the one played by Anne Reid as Celia.  Celia's internalized bitterness and bigotry actually turn her character into an unrecognizably ugly person. Her rejection and heartlessness towards Caroline is stunning. The blow-up in the kitchen, when Celia comes to tell Caroline that Alan is finished with her is powerful and on-point:  believable and gut wrenching.  I found myself awed by the change in Ann Reid's face when her racial and homophobic bigotry expressed itself; an amazing piece of acting.

And of course, what is not to love about Derek Jacobi! As Gillian says, he has something good etched right through him and it comes across.  His presence in the series is anchoring.  He is essential; he grounds it all. Further, the man has some serious dance moves!

In the end, there isn't a weak performance in the bunch; great casting, great ensemble work, wonderful direction and cinematography.  Nina Sosanya is a perfect foil for the volatile Caroline.  She is soft, restrained, subtly communicative and sexy.  John (Tony Gardner), the feckless husband, is wonderfully done. He is hilarious.  The most amusing series of emotions ripple silently across his face to great effect:  his outrage when Caroline throws water on him in the garden, or even funnier, when she flips off her reason for going over to his ex-lover's place was to have sex!

The tender moments with Caroline's and Gillian's boys are perhaps my favorites in the series: Lawrence's young boy's heart, intent on protecting his mother from meanness.  She, in return, provides her grown-up comforting, letting him know she is big and can handle mean.  William's consistent sweetness and protectiveness of his mother in the face of his weak and selfish father: easily accepting Caroline's new found love with Kate, helping her verbalize her truth, and having a birthday card ready at the stroke of midnight. Who wouldn't wish to have a son like William.  And Raff - you can see his love for his mother in the scene after Alan (Derek Jacobi) and Celia (Ann Reid) are found after their night locked in a tiny local rectory -the tenderness shoots out of his eyes as he gathers Gillian in.

What a wonderful series of heart-warming, well-delivered and intriguing relationships!  Looking forward to Season 2!",1382745600,36,3890,4.924846625766871

The second one was still entertaining -- but clearly was going down the typical soap opera path BBC/Masterpiece usually follows these days. (One fabulous exception is the Call the Midwife series.) SPOILERS AHEAD. By the third episode, the majority of it focused on the dysfunctional decisions and tawdry sex lives of the adult children of the older couple. One guy in particular (who was engaged to be married but having sex with Derek Jacobi's daughter) was downright creepy. Not to mention it reeks of political correctness on a variety of levels. By the end of that episode I had absolutely no desire to see another minute of it.

5788777,4,B00DC5K2J4,"Review for early episodes: As another reviewer said, a good show leaves you longing for the next episode.  Well, I can't wait! Love this show, my favorite on PBS since Downton Abbey! I concur with much of the K. Harris review, but will add a few wrinkles of my own.  First of all, this show is honest.  People are flawed, life is complicated, and no one is one-dimensional. The writing is sublime.  The acting is wonderful, of course, starting with Reid and Jacobi.  I'm in love with them!  Who can resist their joy in finding each other after so many years? Reid's character has something of a bitter edge, but Jacobi's character accepts her unconditionally and tenderly. I loved their spirited discussions of religion and politics, while always knowing that their love is bigger than their differences. Their daughters are a mess, but such an intriguing mess! Their layered performances and changing relationships with each other, as well as other characters, are complex and fascinating.  Perhaps best of all, there are many moments of surprising black comedy that often make me laugh out loud, but may have eluded or offended some viewers. To me, it's a big part of what makes this show so special and unsentimental. My friend is as hooked as I am. So if you like lots of flavors in your viewing, with a big heart at the center, give this one a chance.

Edited 10/17/2013.  Whoa, this show went haywire in the last two episodes of the season. My friend, who saw them separately, felt the same. (The episode prior was our favorite, after which I wrote the above review.)  Trying to do too much, seem too hip, what?  Sour, dark, and unlikeable is not the same as quirky, edgy, but warm . It's like all the plot lines went over some kind of line at the same time, and I found myself tensing in discomfort instead of laughing in empathy and delight.  Hope they get back on track again next season, or it's ruined for me.  4 Stars because the rest of the episodes are so  delightful.",1380672000,41,1982,4.59375

This is a charming, wonderful romp through the best of British acting and writing and what is truly surprising is how ""dark"" this show is.  At first glance you think what a cute little valentine to old love and to finding your high school sweetheart and then all of a sudden you realize that there are a dozen or so sub plots about spousal abuse and teen age loss and parents who have committed suicide and marriages that are at heart destructive and all of a sudden you realize that this is not just a Hallmark Greeting Card show about two older lovers but rather a show like Call the Mid Wife (my favorite show of the past few years) where on center stage we find not just two senior citizens who find themselves but rather the whole panorama of human existence.

5788781,1,B00DC5K2J4,"A good television series leaves you longing for the next episode - that is the test.  Unfortunately, Last Tango in Halifax does not leave you longing for the next installment.  Based on an interesting premise, the plot revolves around two widowed seventy somethings who reconnect after sixty years.  Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi - great actors, who, in my opinion are out of their element, play the two.  The characters never sparkle, never shine.  That, I believe is the death knell; if an audience can't empathize with the leading characters, all is lost.

The proceedings are so sour, so dreary, that after the episode ends one feels as if one has been slimed.  A dirty, grimy feeling pervades the whole thing.  To give the reader an example, the Anne Reid character gleefully tells her daughter that her friend Derek Jacobi has spent the night with her and that they engaged in sex.  The daughter is very uncomfortable, but the mother (Reid) proceeds to tell her that she had forgotten ""how great sex was!""  A scene that could have been funny and even charming turns out to be unseemly and leaves the viewer uncomfortable.

Another scene has the Reid/Jacobi couple swearing and cursing inside a church.  Later they engage in a conversation about God that degenerates into a diatribe about religious people oppressing the masses!  I wonder how many viewers will be turned off just from this scene alone.

Last Tango in Halifax tries to be politically correct to a fault; yes, it's a subtle political correctness, but nevertheless insidious - the message here is that the past was peopled by big, bad individuals who lived to put you in your place and now we live in such an enlightened time that we can do whatever we want.  Yet the characters are so miserable, and it is a misery of their own making, specifically because these people did whatever they wanted without thinking of the consequences.  There is nothing to like in the cast of selfish, peevish bores.  Again, an audience has to have empathy for the characters to make a series work.  Take Downton Abbey - the audience cares about the characters, empathizes with them, is interested in what they are going to do, feels sorry for them, and yes, even loves them.  Unfortunately, in Last Tango in Halifax, I don't care about any of these characters and that, in a nutshell, says it all!",1380240000,23,2346,4.7481481481481485

The third episode was not as enjoyable as the first two.  We watched on-line because we had missed the Sunday broadcast.",1380153600,6,256,5.071428571428571

5788785,4,B00DC5K2J4,"I love the title of this new PBS series, quite different in tone than 'The Last Tango In Paris'. However, it is about love, sex, couples, children, anger and everything in-between.

This series is based on a true story of writer Sally Wainwright's recollection of her mother's second marriage. This series tells a story of a man and a woman who reconnect via Facebook. Each of them had a crush on the other, which was more like love, 50 odd years ago and they meet up. Alan, played by Derek Jacobi, lives with his daughter, Gillian played by the wonderfully expressive, Nicola Walker, and his grandson Raff. They live on a sheep farm out in the country.

Celia, played by Anne Reid was, unhappily married to a man who slept around. She, too lives with her daughter, Caroline, played by Sarah Lancashire, who is the Head of a public school near Yorkshire. They have money, and Caroline likes to think of herself as an upper class.

The first meetings if the families, us for Alan and Celia to tell them they are getting married. No sense in waiting after all this time. That is fine, but both daughters are going through difficult times with the men in their lives and their children. This will not be easy combining both families. A lot of drama and laughs surround both families, you know the kind of drama we all have.

Messes occur, people say uncouth things, they quarrel, they live, they laugh and cry. The difference here is that this wonderful group of actors bring Halifax alive. It is a series to remember.
