747808,4,630394177X,"Very beautiful visually, but that is not what counts after you have used the video every day for a couple of months.  The second part is wonderful.  The third part I really dislike doing 3 back bends in a row but they say  what you dislike is probably what you need to work on. The fourth part is  very relaxing though I don't use a bolster(as suggested) and cannot bend  all the way to the floor on a front bend sitting. My only Big complaint  with this video is that Rodney Yee comes on directly following the  relaxation pose, which is the last part of the tape.  Either you must reach  for the remote control and ruin your state of relaxed mind or else listen  to him giving the benefits of doing the video....I prefer Patricia Waldens  relaxation at the end of ""For Beginners"" Overall though  practicing this video daily is wonderful: giving you a healthier state of  mind and leaving you energized.",945216000,8,904,4.47239263803681
747809,3,630394177X,"I was expecting this tape to be more of a Power Yoga tape.  This tape is basically stretching and poses, and in my opinion he doesn't hold the poses long enough.  I hardly got my heart rate going; it is not an intermed or  advanced tape whatsoever.  I've been doing power yoga occasionally for a  few years now, and consider myself beginner/intermediate, and this tape was  way too easy (and boring) for me.  I do think it's relaxing, and the  scenery is nice, and I like the cues and little talk.  However, direction  and guidance are necessary for people who are not familiar with the poses  (which could be risky), so this tape may not be best for brand new  beginners.  And it is only 40 min's, if that.",943401600,12,707,4.387596899224806

747955,2,630394177X,I have purchased 3 Rodney Yee dvd's and REALLY wanted to love them because I believe Gaiam is a trusted yoga brand and all of the great reviews online. I think his DVD's are good for beginners however I don't find the flow or instruction to be as beneficial as other online tutorials including P90X and of course in person classes which there is probably no substitute for. If I had purchased this before practicing yoga for 7 years I probably would've loved it.,1422576000,,462,4.511904761904762

747958,5,630394177X,"This is my third copy of this DVD, that's how much I love it!  I have lost a few copies over the past 10+ years since I first bought it, and it is always worth getting the replacement.  I am a yoga teacher and long time practitioner of various forms of yoga, and this is my go-to, favorite, not-have-to-think-about-it, home practice DVD.  My favorite feature is that it is broken into five short segments, so I can pick and choose depending on what I have time and energy for.  Some days I do one ten-minute segment, and other days I may do three segments for a little more exercise.  It is not strenuous for me, but a nice stretch and a bit of a heart-rate elevator that you can squeeze into a hectic schedule.  Having used this DVD for a while, I just listen to Rodney's verbal cues for the next pose, and don't need to look at the video much.  The instruction is very simple (he just calls out the name of the pose) so it might be better for the very beginner to have some classroom yoga instruction first, but I'm not necessarily convinced about that.  Beginners might be fine watching the video first and just paying close attention.  They might be able to pick it up well if they are mindful observers, or experienced in some other form of physical expression.",1407456000,2,1266,4.3760683760683765

748078,5,630394177X,"I purchased this as a video tape when originally released 1996.  If I had to choose one Yoga flow for the rest of my life, this is it. Impossible to figure how many times I have used this.  I recently bought several for Chistmas gifts, and my love for this CD is shared by all of them.",1397001600,,285,3.982456140350877
748079,4,630394177X,"Although this DVD is promoted as 5 separate practices, it is only about 48 minutes long in total, and the 5 sections flow seamlessly into each other (although I found it best to turn my mat parallel to the TV to do the standing pose section).  The sections are:  opening stretches; standing poses; sun salutations/vinyasa with some backbends; forward bends; and shavasana.  If you do the whole thing, you'll get a well-rounded practice that works the entire body.

There are some spots in the third section after the sun salutations that seem a bit choppy - you have to alternate very quickly between various standing poses and downward dog.  The poses don't flow naturally into each other and I found it a bit awkward to move back and forth quickly enough.  As other reviewers have said, the way he orders the standing poses is a bit unusual too -alternating left and right sides with successive poses rather than doing each on left and right and then moving on.  However, once I realized that was what he was doing, it was fine.

I really like the fact that there is not a lot of talking.  Rodney simply names each pose, and you can focus on your breath and listen to the music in between.  I know this wouldn't be good for a total beginner, but if you know the poses and how to transition safely between them, I find it makes the practice more relaxing.",1392249600,,1356,4.520491803278689
748080,5,630394177X,"I've done numerous in-person yoga classes and videos, and this one is my perennial favorite. Years ago, I bought it in VHS form to deepen my home practice when I was a beginner. With more than a decade of additional yoga experience, I still find the flow, pace, production value, and completeness of the workout works so well for me, it's a go-to whenever I need to re-center my practice or realign my body. Rodney Yee is a fantastic guide--his precision and the explanation of the use of props very in keeping with the Iyengar style that I appreciate. I didn't even mind purchasing it on DVD when it was time to upgrade.",1384387200,,621,4.504424778761062

748084,5,630394177X,"I do yoga every morning and I really like this DVD. I'm glad it wasn't the FIRST one I bought because there are no instructions for the poses, but with a little experience from the beginner DVD's it is easy to follow. When I'm not totally sure what he means I can just look up at the screen and see what he's doing and I'm all set. I like how soothing the music is in this one and I also like how the segments are separate, but still can be played all together. Over all I really like this yoga practice. The only complaint I can come up with is that Rodney is wearing a lot less clothing than I am comfortable with. (Just an underwear cut pair of shorts.) But I don't look at the screen much when I am following along, so it's not really an issue.",1356825600,,748,4.026845637583893
748085,5,630394177X,"I admittedly am a huge fan of Rodney Yee's style of yoga.  This video is an absolute new favorite!  The first segment is nice and slow, and relaxing, as are the last two segments.  The flowing segments in between are very fast moving.  I LOVE the minimal chatter.  I have never experienced a yoga DVD that simply stated the pose names, and will be seeking out more like this.  It was nice to be able to listen to the ocean waves and the music instead of chatter.  VERY conducive to really getting into your practice.

Because there are only pose names and no constant instruction for breathing, you should have a familiarity with yoga poses before doing this DVD.  I only saw one pose that was maybe a bit challenging for a beginner, and you can just lay on your back and breathe during this time if you need to.

Overall, a new favorite!  I don't often do longer practices but the time really flew for me on this one.  I didn't get as hard of a workout as his power yoga DVDs, but I did get a workout in the flowing sections.  Mostly I just felt great afterwards.  This is a really balanced practice with equal parts strength, balancing, lengthening, and relaxation.  Highly recommended!  I will be doing this one weekly!",1340668800,2,1222,4.436936936936937
748086,5,630394177X,"I was so glad to find this on Amazon!  This is the best Yoga dvd for beginners (but athletic).

748087,5,630394177X,"I ordered a different video, and when I opened the case, this was the one that was in there. I loved it. Im pretty new to yoga, and seriously overweight, but i could follow along and do all of the poses. I am so glad this was the video I got. It's slow, and there is no instruction. I would recommend doing a yoga video that provides instruction first, or watching it a few times first. I think it is a lot different than other yoga videos. Its not the same old thing, fast sun salutations. This is much better. It is also so relaxing! I recently quit smoking, and this really helps with dealing with stress.

748178,5,630394177X,"This routine is the best.  I've been using it for 5 years, and although I keep trying other DVDs, I have yet to find one that I like better than this.  Sometimes I only do the first segment if I just need a quick stretch; but the full routine leaves me feeling relaxed and energized.  I give this DVD credit for keeping me fit, healthy, and calm through two pregnancies and recoveries.  I'm about to buy my third copy (I keep getting them scratched) and am thrilled with the investment.",1314230400,,486,4.366666666666666
748179,5,630394177X,"Basically, this video is great for beginners-intermediates. It's a cool concept, working in different yoga poses at different times of day in order to generate the 'right kind of energy'. I personally enjoy this method, and I watch this dvd with my two other Rodney Yee videos in rotation for even more variety. It's fun, I love this one.",1295395200,,338,4.745762711864407
748180,2,630394177X,"I only write reviews when I find something very well done (five stars) or a waste of my time and money.  To be fair, I tried working out with this DVD several times, thinking that I might get into it.  It just doesn't work for me.  The biggest problem is the pace.  Was this seriously labelled as a 'high beginner' level?  Just try to keep up with the narration!  ""Up dog""...3 seconds later...""down dog""...  Unless your body is made of rubber, I don't see any ""beginning"" practitioners getting in and out of these postures that quickly...to say nothing of the safety.

  Another major drawback is the lack of advice or instruction.  Perhaps it was felt that this would be distracting for those who wanted to use this DVD to relax.  So the DVD relies heavily on some pretty garish visuals...tangerine colored beaches, purple ocean waves... and new age background muzak...windchimes and bells which become tiresome after 5 minutes or so.  I own and use about 10 different yoga DVDs, there are certainly much better routines on the market.",1292630400,3,1036,4.752808988764045

748182,5,630394177X,"I recommend the Yoga Journal's Energy Balance Yoga over the full body workout dvd.  You get the same stances and more. Furthermore, names of the poses are given with the Energy Balance Yoga dvd far more often than with this one.  Once you practice each position you could do them without looking at the dvd, but the total body workout moves you into a position and forgets to tell you the name of the position.

However there are some instructions regarding use of props within the total body workout that is not in the Energy Balance dvd.

If you enjoy a great workout and simple for most anyone to do at least 90% of the poses, then this workout is really beneficial.",1231372800,,669,4.459016393442623
748183,5,630394177X,"I used to have the Yoga Journal's Energy Balance videotape, which was fine.  Only did not really like the speech about yoga at the end of the yoga workout.  This DVD put his speech at the beginning now, which is better.  Love Rodney Yee's yoga methods!",1224806400,,252,4.434782608695652
748184,3,630394177X,"I didn't see any results, nor did I improve my practice with this DVD.  The poses in the second section are fast pace and not easy to follow.  The exercise is not aerobic at all.  The locations are beautiful and I use some of the poses as stretches after running.",1198108800,,263,4.22
748185,5,630394177X,"I had this particular Rodney Yee program for years on VHS, until it wore out.  I was glad to find it on DVD.  With over 30 years of practice, it remains my favorite routine.  Divided into 5 short mini-routines geared toward different times of day, you can choose which ones fit your need.  It is easy and fun enough for beginners, but challenging enough for more advanced practitioners who need a ""pick-me-up"" during the day.",1190764800,,425,4.626666666666667
748186,4,630394177X,"This video is one the I use for my daily practice.  It's so nice not to hear verbal instruction -- that might be necessary for beginners, or the first few times you use a DVD, but after the 50th time you hear the same old stuff you feel like telling Rodney to ""Shut up!""  In this DVD, all you hear is the name of the pose -- which would be a disadvantage to absolute beginners.

The first section ""Awakening"" is similar to the A.M. Yoga, or the ""Back Care"" section of the Healing tape in this same series.  Nice, easy stretches.

The second section ""Centering"" is a nice flow series of standing poses.  It really gives me some much-needed help with balance.  You go through the series twice, first doing Tree to the right, then Triangle to the left, and so on through, Side Stretch, Warrior I and II, Half Moon, Warrior III, and Extended Leg Stretch.  It's the shortest routine on the DVD, but quite possibly the best.

The third section, ""Creativity"" is the most difficult, and the one which seems to generate the most complaints.  It *is* fast; I think it's intended to be aerobic.  The worst part to me is that I simply can't make some of the transitions.  It is physically impossible for me to jump from dog pose to standing forward bend, for example, or to go directly from downward dog to Triangle.  Dog pose, or the plank-up dog-down dog sequence is used to transition between poses, and quite frankly, I usually just skip this and do the next pose. (Anyone who needs to use the blocks will not be able to keep up otherwise.) Things slow down towards the end, however.  I keep trying with this practice, but I skip it more frequently than any of the others on the DVD, and it's the reason I can't give it five stars.

The fourth practice ""Reflection"" is virtually the opposite of the one before -- nice, slow seated forward bends.  You spend quite a long time in each one, and it's very relaxing.

Finally, there's a short four-minute relaxation pose, the only practice where there's any narration.  I usually mute it at this point; if you don't, you'll find yourself rudely awakened by Rodney explaining the whole concept behind the Energy practice.

Overall, it's a good everyday practice, and that's how I use it. I add some conscious breathing before I start, and meditation after it's over, and that's my usual yoga practice for the day.",1185840000,7,2349,4.536817102137767
748187,5,630394177X,"I have been into Yoga for several years and am now going to the Intermediate level. This superb Rodney Yee DVD is for one who knows the Yoga positions as this is done with little dialog and one is expected to be very familiar with Yoga. Each session is at a different time of the day. The first 2 sessions are my favorites in the morning and take just about 15 minutes. The 3rd one the Creativity lasts right at 16 Minutes (the longest, most difficult and the very fastest section). The last 2 sessions called Reflection (11 minutes) and Surrender (4 minutes) are my PM favorites. These were done on the DVD at SUNSET and these last 2 sessions, just 15 minutes total are wonderful to do in the PM after dinner and I have found that I am so relaxed and sleep wonderful after I have done these! What I love so much about this DVD is the navigation is so easy and you can choose the section that you wish to work on. This, I give a SUPERB RATING and oh yes, 10 STARS!

748267,5,630394177X,"Exercise is one of my passions.  My collection of videos and DVDs is huge.  I always love a challenge.  The reason I even started doing Yoga was that severe degenerative arthritis began to impair my ability to do many of my favorite aerobics.  The very first DVD that introduced me to Yoga is Patricia Walden, Flexibility Yoga.  I highly recommend it as an introduction to Yoga.  It is very good.  She explains the poses in great detail.

Yoga For Energy was the second DVD that I tried.  It was extremely challenging especially in the beginning.  I had sweat pouring off of me by the end of the session.  That has always been a gauge for a good workout.

I love the fact that I can now do a backbend.  The mobility that I was losing from arthritis is returning.  My body definately responds well to this workout.  My collection of Yoga DVDs has grown.  I love most of them.  My favorites still include this one.  It still challenges me, but I love a good challenge.",1179964800,,966,4.422857142857143

Rodney Yee's instruction and demonstration, as in all his workout videos, is clear and precise.  Instruction on this video is limited to barest indication of each next move, but that is intentional, so that you can focus on what you're doing rather than on commentary.  This is a beginner workout but still challenging, and its five segments can be done continuously or individually, depending on your needs and available time.  My favorites are the Centering and Creativity segments -- even if I'm short on time I can still get in a decent workout and I really do feel energized.",1173312000,2,777,4.608695652173913
748269,4,630394177X,"Great for advanced beginners to intermediate hatha practitioners.  this dvd uses no verbal instruction beyond merely stating what pose to move into next.

the background audio, the lack of chatter, and the beautiful video make a very soothing combination for the greatest possible stress relief.  Yee says in the intro: ""The absence of verbal instruction allows you to focus on the movement, breath, emotions and energy you feel""

Each activity corresponds to the 5 elements:

Awakening to earth -- being grounded in the morning helps you engage with the day.

Centering to water -- going with the flow helps you interact calmly with people.

Creativity to fire -- getting things accomplished shakes stress out of your body.

Reflection to air -- using the mind to recall the day and reflect on your attitudes helps you let go of strategies that aren't working.

Surrender to ether -- putting your worries, concerns, and accomplishments out to the universe lets a higher power help you.

You can use the video throughout the day or as a lovely 45 minute meditation to interact with the elements, your own body, and your attitudes in a process that leaves you calmer, more grounded, and more energized.

my desire is for Rodney Yee to do another, more intensive video in this exact format of only stating the pose instead of the chatter",1156032000,2,1335,4.888888888888889
748270,5,630394177X,"I discovered yoga years ago with Rodney's Power Yoga for Beginners.  It held my interest for quite a while.  Eventually I put in on a cassette tape so I could use it before rehearsals for a show I was doing.  After a while, I longed for something different.  I tried Lilias, but she is SOOOO slow, it's hard to get a workout.  I tried others, but their stacatto, clipped voices took away all the relaxation benefits I get from yoga.  Rodney understands ambience.  The visuals are beautiful, the voice tone is relaxing, the background music adds to the experience, and he's really easy on the eyes.

This video is great for someone who knows the positions already and doesn't need the instruction, just guidance to transition from one to the other.  I also like that it's in modules so that if I don't have time for all of it, it has good cut off points.  It also gets difficult enough to give me a workout.

Finally, as a dancer, I love that it is one long, continuous movement, like an adagio.  The stopping and starting of all the other yoga people keeps me from getting into the zone.  Also, as a dancer, it appeals to me because he choreographs the transitions smoothly and beautifully.  I am a Rodney Yee fan and with all the versions he has out, I don't think I'll ever need to look around again.",1143331200,8,1302,4.415966386554622

i have more energy, flexibility, postue and muscle tone.
i would definatly reccomend this, however begginers should use a video for begginners, but once you know the moves, its simple!!!
my sister tried yoga and loves it too!
i am going to train to be a yoga teacher, i have a pssion for yoga, and this video is amazing!!
also, the people who give this a bad rating, im afraid are the ones who are still very much begginners and find it too challenging for them.

748275,4,630394177X,"I've been practicing yoga with tapes for about 9 months now and consider myself to be an advanced beginner.  This tape was very different from any of the others I've tried, mainly because there was no narrative instruction.  The instructor, Rodney Yee, simply states the name of each pose, assuming that you are already familiar with the poses.  Therefore, this tape is NOT for beginners who have never done yoga before.  However, for those who have already learned the poses elsewhere, the difficulty of this tape is at a beginner or advanced beginner level.
The five sections of the tape are designed to be performed throughout the day based on your needs.  The first, Awakening, is 9 minutes of mostly floor stretches and moves very slowly.  The second, Centering, is 7 minutes of relatively easy standing poses and is designed to be used in the morning.  The third and longest section (15 minutes) is Creativity.  This section is designed to be done during the day for energy, and it moves much more quickly than any of the other sections.  Although I enjoyed how Rodney flowed from one pose to the other, it moved a little too fast for me--for example, you must very quickly move from downward dog to a standing pose such as proud warrior.  One interesting thing was that the standing poses weren't just done on one side of the body and then the other.  For example, instead of doing proud warrior left and then proud warrior right, you do proud warrior left, then side stretch right, etc. in a whole sequence before eventually going back and reversing the sequence to do the moves on the other side.  Again, I liked the flow, but it moved very fast.
The last two sections really are meant to be done together.  First is Reflection, which contains 11 minutes of seated forward bends for tranquility.  Finally comes Surrender, 4 minutes in relaxation pose.  This is the only time which Rodney provides more instruction, as he leads you through a guided relaxation.  At the END of the tape, Rodney talks about the purpose of the workout as well as how to modify the poses, so it would probably be helpful to watch this section first.  The scenery is a beautiful beach setting, and the music is softly new-agey (flutes, etc.).  For the three middle sections, Rodney has 1-2 others performing the routine along with him.
Although I liked this video, it doesn't really meet my personal needs.  I think this workout would be best for someone who can purchase a DVD version, which would make it a lot easier to move between the different workouts.  If you are someone who would like to do different types of yoga routines at different times of the day, this tape would be for you.",1028160000,40,2678,4.669509594882729
748276,5,630394177X,"This video as well as the others that comprise the beginners practice series is the best outside of a classroom. As Patricia Walden states in Yoga practice for Flexability, these tapes are supplemental to your weekly Yoga Practice! These tapes are very well done and really teach you the fundamentals of Yoga. And YES the third segement ""Creativity"" I believe, does seem to move quickly, BUT of ALL the segements, this one teaches the breath/body movements. I.E. one exhalation to get into the pose, then Inhale, exhale fully while moving into the next pose. THIS IS what YOGA IS. If you don't link the breath with the movements then it's gymnastics!",1026864000,2,650,4.864864864864865
748414,5,630394177X,"This video of Rodney Yees is very useful and beautifully made.
 The quality of the filming and the scenery make it very appealing. The music is also very serene to help create a spacious atmosphere for doing yoga (there are some videos where the music is too oppressive).
 It has many different types of routines that can be used depending on your level of energy and differing needs.
 I would highly recommend it to anyone but would certainly get
Patricia Walden's ""Yoga Practice for Beginners"" first in order to learn the basic yoga poses first.
 Other tapes I would recommend are ""Rainbeau Mars"" new 4 tape series ""Sacred Yoga"" which is a vinyasa flow style that has two more gentle tapes ""For Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" and then two more challenging tapes ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"".  Then of course there's the excellent ""Total Yoga Flow Series"" by Tracey Rich and Ganja White which is a three tape set moving thru levels from more gentle to VERY challenging. These are fabulous tapes!
 Another recommendation I would make is Eric Schiffman's book ""Yoga, the practice of moving into stillness"" for an excellent guide to the ""internal"" practice of yoga. Also Donna Farhi's ""Yoga, Body Mind and Spirit is an amazing guide to making Yoga more internal and personal. These books will help you make your poses more ""alive"" as you practice.",1010880000,6,1349,4.843478260869565
748415,4,630394177X,"I really enjoyed this video.  I appreciated its format of little chatter, and the asanas chosen are terrific.

748416,4,630394177X,"This is definitely not for the yoga neophyte.  And you should definitely view the tape at least twice before beginning practice.  However, I must say that this tape was all that it promised to be and much more.
Rodney Yee guides you through five seesions designed to give you more energy and help you get more in tune with the elements.  I like that there isn't a whole lot of talking in the tape and you can focus on your poses and breathing.  As someone who was looking to round out my yoga practice, I found the tape to be challenging without being frustrating and to actually deliver on the promise of renewed energy.
I would suggest this tape for anyone who is ready to move beyond basic poses.",1002153600,7,699,4.395348837209302
748417,5,630394177X,"I'll add my enthusiastic recommendation to the others found here. I've been doing yoga with tapes off and on for years (and have taken some classes) and have checked out at least half of the tapes in the Yoga Journal series. This is by far my favorite. With five different yoga practice segments on it, one for each part of the day, it's a great value for the money, and gives you a lot of flexibility to adapt your session as you wish. The mid-day segments are moderately challenging, but even a beginner could probably do them if first trained in how to modify poses and use props. (A segment at the end of the tape explains how to do this.) Warning: First timers will not be able to use this tape as it does not include instruction in how to do the poses; if you've never done yoga before, take some classes or get Patricia Walden's introduction to yoga from this series. For the rest of us though, the lack of chatter about ""how to"" do the poses makes the tape more relaxing to do and less boring to listen to. The tape as a whole allows you to try many different poses. Yet these are collected in sessions to fit any mood or need -- from ""don't push me I just want to relax"" through ""make me work, I want to get strong."" If I could keep only one of my many yoga tapes, this would be the one.",1001462400,5,1296,4.1673306772908365
748418,5,630394177X,"I think evan Rodney Yee said, in an interview, that this was the best tape he has made thus far.  Although that interview was given back in 1999, or so.  I think this is his best video, of the ones I have seen.  I did this every day for 6 months, the middle three workouts, and got in great shape.  this is just a great healthy way to get in shape. If you have never done Yoga before, you might want to do the Patrica Walden ""Yoga for Beginners"" for one or two weeks, and then go to the ""Yoga for Energy"" tape.",991008000,11,510,3.9223300970873787
748419,5,630394177X,"This is a fabulous yoga video.  The way it is sectioned off is very convenient because it allows you to do only the sections that you feel you need at the time.  I like this feature of the video because I have two small children and, with frequent interruptions,  find it difficult sometimes to do all the sections at one time.  It's definitely for those who have already had some instruction on how to do the poses.  It helped me to first attend a yoga class with an instructor who can spend some one-on-one time showing me the correct way to do the poses.",975024000,6,557,4.3173076923076925
748420,4,630394177X,"This video is great for me because it is split into 5 short workouts.  I don't know about anyone else, but getting up way early to exercise just isn't possible, but 16 minutes early to do the first 2 sections is entirely doable.  The scenery is nice and the only instruction is the name of the pose, no lengthly instruction which may get on your nerves after the 15th time you use the tape.  So, if you are a complete beginner i would suggest doing the Yoga Journal's Practice for Beginners for a little more instruction.",972864000,15,521,4.40625
748421,3,630394177X,"I have been practicing Yoga for several years now both at home and in a class setting.  I feel that this video is good, but it is too fast paced.  What I like about Yoga are the gentle movements and postures that, when  held for a period of time, stretch and tone all muscle groups.  I feel that  by moving quickly through the postures, my muscles do not stretch as much  and therefore I feel disappointed at the end of the workout.  In fact, I  sometimes skip portions of the video and combine it with another video I  own or create my own workout.",966902400,5,549,4.201923076923077

748423,4,630394177X,"I love this video.  I purchased it a few years ago after taking a series of classes; so I already knew a few poses.  As I could no longer afford to take classes, I started looking for a good, soothing video from which to  develop a daily routine.  This definitely was it: the program moves from a  gentle stretching phase to a more vigorous series of poses and then back  again.  All of the routines emphasize a continuous flow between poses (no  jumping around here!) Few of the poses in the video are out of reach for  the average beginner and, even more importantly, the video stresses doing  only what is comfortably within your range of motion - unlike some live  classes!
The only reason I award this video 4 stars instead of 5 is  that I found the duration of each segment to not be long enough - the  stretching was over before I was sufficiently warmed up, and the more  vigorous routines ended before I had had enough, forcing me to divorce my  attention from meditating through each pose to locating the remote and  rewinding the tape (I'd really love it if these were on DVD).  Still, I  would recommend this video to anyone who was either developing a passion  for yoga or just interested in a deeply relaxing yet invigorating workout!",953683200,11,1248,4.491071428571429
