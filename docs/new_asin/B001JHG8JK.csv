8312867,5,B001JHG8JK,"After seeing the 1st ABCs of Strings DVD, I was anxious to see this next one. I was NOT disappointed. The violin playing by the little girl was great as was the piano accompaniment by the young man. It even showed restringing the violin. Ms Rhoda always does a fine job of explaining and showing things. I can't wait for the DVD about the cello and bass.",1233878400,4,354,4.298507462686567
8312868,5,B001JHG8JK,"This intermediate level violin DVD is very useful in helping my students to be motivated to practice violin. I've been teaching violin to students for many years and have been using the ABCs of Violin beginner DVD with my students as reinforcement with excellent results.

This intermediate level DVD is showing my students how to change a string, do bow hold strengthening exercises and the spiccato bow stroke. Best of all is the emphasis on good practice habits talked about by Ms. Rhoda -- useful ideas I incorporated into my teaching just this week.

Playing along with the talented violinist after following the preparation steps suggested by Ms. Rhoda will make students feel more confident about playing and progress of all the pieces contained in the ABCs of Violin Books 1 and 2. The 3 scales play-along is very good.

The menu is easy to navigate -- a real plus since other violin instructional dvds I've looked at are not that easy for students to navigate through and the sound quality and intonation (playing in tune) aren't as good as on this dvd. It's professionally done by professionally trained players and I am recommending it to all my students for review and reinforcement to my in-lesson teaching. It's difficult to find something at this level that is really good and inspiring. This is it.",1228348800,6,1314,4.857142857142857
