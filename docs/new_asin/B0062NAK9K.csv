The sensitivity of the filmmakers allows for a context - to view this documentary with an understanding of their cultural historical perspective. It is a well made film, strong story line, focused evolution of the story with central character development continuum. It is important to know and attempt understanding of the history of the story of the American government's involvement in Asia and Central Asia, in it's various shapes and forms throughout America's history of governing administrations. The documentary could have been just that, history but instead the filmmakers told personal stories of surviving Tibet soldier resistance fights. The emotion very much alive, the hurt within the historical participants is very much being reconciled. The living history with which all those involved are still healing from hurts, but shines Self-illumination. It is a documentary story of the people who walked through this chapter of history, are still alive and continue to have their own story to tell - be it a Tibetan Resistance fighter, a CIA field operatve or administrator States-side. Everyone is interviewed who could be, who contributed to this live-living-history-story. This is an important part of history that deserves witnessing, hopefully to not be repeated again and even more so in creating a healing completion for all those involved.

The filmmakers are Indian-Tibetan wife-and-husband team, and have been making films since our student days in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 80s. Since then they have shared
a career that has spanned several documentaries, video installations and one dramatic feature film. Ritu was born in New Delhi. She studied at Miranda House in Delhi University and went on to finish her studies at California College of the Arts in Oakland. Tenzing was born in Darjeeling in India to Tibetan refugee parents. He studied at St Stephens College in Delhi University and then specialized in documentary filmmaking at the Graduate School of Journalism, University of California, Berkeley. They are currently based in New Delhi and Dharamshala.

The filmmakers Description of their film:
The Tibetan people are well known for being devoutly religious and peace loving. What is less known is that thousands of Tibetans took up arms against the invading forces of Communist China and waged a bitter and bloody guerrilla war. From the mid-1950s until 1969 they were aided in their efforts by an unlikely ally, the CIA. This project, code-named ST CIRCUS, was one of the CIA's longest running covert operations. The withdrawal of the CIA's support in 1969 was as abrupt as its initial involvement was unexpected: the Tibetans had simply fitted into America's larger policy of destabilising or overthrowing Communist regimes, and when that no longer applied, they were abandoned. With unique archive footage and exclusive interviews with former resistance fighters and surviving CIA operatives, The Shadow Circus: The CIA in Tibetreveals for the first time this hitherto unknown chapter in Tibet's recent history - a tale that is both heroic and tragic, full of sad ironies and unexpected twists that overturn all preconceptions about both Tibet and the CIA.
