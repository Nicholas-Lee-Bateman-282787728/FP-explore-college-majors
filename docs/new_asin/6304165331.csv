7865290,2,6304165331,"I was very disappointed in this video. I bought it to use with a group of Cub Scouts (3rd grade) who are earning their Weather Belt Loop. I love weather, but this video is boring! The exciting things that kids want to watch -- tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, etc. -- are just barely touched on in short video clips. The video skims the surface of weather and doesn't linger on anything long enough to really entertain OR inform you. The recurring motif of the rotating rooster weather vane gets really annoying after a while.",1046304000,4,524,4.645161290322581
7865291,4,6304165331,"This was a very good video, but I don't watch TV and was therefore unaware that its format is suited for young people: kids and young adults. I enjoyed watching it once, but will probably put it up for sale at Half.com. I recommend it to anyone who has children interested in meteorology.",1044316800,,288,4.452830188679245
7865292,4,6304165331,"Weather takes you on a whirlwind tour of Earth's turbulent atmosphere and reveals the forces that make the day fair and foul. From hurricane to heat wave,weather is the most closely watched wild card in nature- yet it still baffles us.",1025049600,5,235,4.7560975609756095
