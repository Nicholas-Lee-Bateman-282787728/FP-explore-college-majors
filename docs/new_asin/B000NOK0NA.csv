2776986,5,B000NOK0NA,"My 4-yo daughter was mad in love with max and ruby episodes on Nickelodeon. They played them so randomly that I had to get some dvds for us to watch. These were great. They just play non-stop, never returning to the title screen. Calming, non-threatening shows for preschoolers. Great way to introduce sibling relationships to children.",1437868800,,336,5.017857142857143

2776991,5,B000NOK0NA,My son really enjoys all the Max and Ruby shows so we bought the dvd's to take on a vacation trip. He loved it so we loved the fact that these dvd's kept him entertained.

2776995,5,B000NOK0NA,"The vast majority of children's videos (that i have seen) are either cheaply produced, polluted with commercials, or riddled with concepts not suitable for children.

in stark contrast, the Max and Ruby series is an absolute  delight.

My daughter truly enjoys watching Max and Ruby and so far, all of the stories i have seen are well written and nicely presented.",1361664000,,364,4.934426229508197
2776996,5,B000NOK0NA,"i think max and ruby are so fantastic my 3 year old started watching it about 6months ago and about that time she became a big sister and ruby has taught her alot about being a good big sister, but she also loves max because he is so goofy and he may makes her laugh, even though he makes ruby mad, but in the end they always compromise and everything works out. that is how it should be with all brothers and sisters TEAM WORK",1354752000,,427,4.035294117647059
2776997,1,B000NOK0NA,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves Max and Ruby.  However, Max is a brat (never listens, talks back, breaks things, etc.) and ruby is a snot and their behavior is never corrected and there are no consequences for it - just the opposite sometimes.  We actually started noticing my daughter's behavior changing after a couple of days with Max and Ruby videos (one show, once or twice a day).  She became bratty, mouthy and stubborn.  After witnessing this a couple of times, we threw the DVD away and found her better role models to watch and she is back to her well behaved self!  She still talks about max and ruby and has a few books (which are slightly better than the shows), but we are not allowed to watch max and ruby at our house.  When you ask her why, she says ""because Max is a brat!""  Yes, he is.",1302739200,,805,4.256578947368421
2776998,5,B000NOK0NA,I got this for my grandson and he have had hours of entertainment. He is almost four years old and he like to watch this over and over. For kids is one of the best characters I have seen lately.  Sweet and simple.,1300665600,,213,3.953488372093023
2777000,5,B000NOK0NA,"Totally exceeded expectations, instant favorite for my daughter, love the Max & Ruby series, instant classics, easy to sit through over and over, only thing to wonder is where are the parents? always alone or with Grandma.",1255910400,,222,5.027027027027027
2777001,5,B000NOK0NA,My granddaughter loves Max & Ruby and this DVD was a good addition to our collection of Max & Ruby stories. We use the DVD to talk over things like sharing and taking turns. I do have to be honest - Ruby loses her appeal after the 87th viewing. LOL,1246665600,2,248,3.98
2777002,1,B000NOK0NA,"What do you think off when someone asks:
No slumber party is complete without ...?

Pillow fight, board games, lemonade, jumping on beds?

Not in this show.
Here is what the authors put in the mouth of Ruby:
1 fashion magazine
2 makeover
3 catwalk

If you want to bring up your kid to be a slave to fashion and consumption. Let's watch this dvd often.

Otherwise stay away. Better check out the Backyardigans.",1234051200,4,409,4.486486486486487
2777003,5,B000NOK0NA,My family absolutely loves Max & Ruby.  This video is no exception.  The lemonade episode is great & my son always wants lemonade after he sees it.

We have been watching them for a few years now and just love that they are coming out with some new shows.  We have not seen some of these so it was exciting to get this dvd.  I love the music that they play in the background, it reminds me of being at my grandparents home when I was growing up.  You can not go wrong with any of the Max and Ruby dvds.",1220918400,,455,3.7473684210526317

2777006,5,B000NOK0NA,"My 4 year old received this for her birthday from her 2 year old brother.  They both love Max and Ruby.  They would probably watch this DVD every day if I let them.  Our whole family enjoys and appreciates the content of Max and Ruby, as there is no violence.  The characters are kind to each other.

No disappointments with this DVD.",1185926400,6,365,5.0
2777009,5,B000NOK0NA,"A few years ago Rosemary Wells' Max and Ruby characters made it to TV via Nick Jr. My 3-year-old grandson is a big fan of the DVDs, compiled from the series. They are gentle and humorous and will be a hit with both youngsters and parents for peace who have problems with the slapstick violence in many other cartoon series.
