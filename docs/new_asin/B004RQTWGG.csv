8439183,4,B004RQTWGG,"This shares the custom of celebration of life for people that pass away. To 'honor' the lives a truck with a stage is rented and driven through town with dancing girls exhibiting their skills, surreal. Includes interviews (sub-titled) that expound upon the behavior. Insightful.",1513036800,,278,5.340909090909091
8439184,3,B004RQTWGG,"This documentary does a good job of explaining, and making you understand, the culture behind funeral strippers in Taiwan as more than just sensationalism. The interviews are well done, with a variety of people, and the narration and editing are good as well, with many interesting insights made into the local culture as well as explaining the views pro and con on the subject.

My main complaint was the poor quality of the video images at times, in other words, they did not spend a lot of money on the use of good quality equipment to capture the images. To that extent it felt more like a homemade video instead of something you would watch on Discovery or Nat. Geo.

Definitely worth it if you're interested in learning more about, not just the subject, but also how it fits into Din Tao aka Zhen Tou (temple performance troupes) culture as a whole.",1387929600,9,855,4.618421052631579
8439185,3,B004RQTWGG,"Who else except the Chinese would and could come up with something like this? Anything for money, right? Well, they can be thanked for destroying massive libraries within hundreds of monastaries in Tibet - doing everything possible to obliterate that magnficent culture. They've mangled and destroyed Falun Gong practitioners on the mainland. And here we're treated to another example of the lunacy that they themselves generate.
Buy this video. Its very instructive. Tells you a lot about the Chinese.",1368576000,,502,5.367088607594937
8439186,4,B004RQTWGG,"The maker of this documentary is a famous and well respected social anthropologist who first wrote about the appeasement of foetus ghosts here in Taiwan - a phenomena that started during a similar period to EFC performance in Taiwan. To answer your comment about how this can be academic, I will briefly describe some of the outlines and goals of social anthropology.

Anthropology is the study of contemporary society. It is not history, neither is is psychology or sociology (sociology tends to look at larger groups and deals with them statistically while anthropology deals with small groups at a persona level)though almost all subjects researched will have a history (except traditions in the process of being invented) and also various ways of analysing them which are usually based on 'social theory' which are psychological. It is a massive subject, and any contemporary aspect of a cultural system may be studied. Putting the subject through the analysis of social theory, and in this case, an ethnographic histography, makes it academic as academics are interested in the structure of society and why and how it's different parts interact and function.

This brings me to one of the goals of an anthropologist: to learn about one aspect of society that is largely unknown or misunderstood so that it can be explained to those from another society, and this is what this video is doing. I have myself seen EFC performances to entertain deities in Taiwan, and it is a social phenomena worthy of academic study as in common with performances for the dead, it raises issues related to the nature of the soul, afterlife and on a mundane level, the tollerence of a society towards it's own localized tradition.",1315008000,17,1715,4.993006993006993
8439187,3,B004RQTWGG,It is strange that the stripper has so much disgust for the deceased. But the real question is how this can be considered academic.,1309910400,3,131,4.5
