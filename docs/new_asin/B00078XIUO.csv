2205112,5,B00078XIUO,"I was amazed to find my cats sat at the edge of the recliner gazing up at this for an entire hour !!  The sounds are great.... and the cats love the scampering mice and the hamsters.  My cats spend time outdoors, also, and liked the smaller birds better than the large ones.  They also liked the raccoon (we have one visit our yard every night), the butterflies, and the squirrel. The least favorite for them was the aquarium fish....  but my daughter's cats like the fish best. This is a great video, and the cats seem to like it just as much with repeated viewings.  Oh, yes..... the color is great, too !!",1169856000,2,608,4.298245614035087

8045913,5,B00078XIUO,This video  is amazing!  My cats love it!  They actually sit in front of the television waiting for me to put it on for them when they know that I am leaving.  I had to find a very heavy chair to put right in front of the television set as one of the cats gets particularly aggressive with the creatures on the video and frequently knocked over the stool I had for him to sit on.,1433721600,,379,3.9473684210526314

8045915,5,B00078XIUO,This video keeps my cats entertained and inquisitive. I love watching them watch it.  It could have had more cats in it.,1365206400,,120,4.454545454545454
8045916,5,B00078XIUO,This video gets my cats attention in a snap. They all line up and sit in front of the TV as soon as they hear it turn on. It is really fun to watch them try to catch the images on the screen or they try to go behind the tv to see where the birds flew off to. So funny.,1332979200,,268,3.4098360655737703
8045917,3,B00078XIUO,"My cat likes this, but I'm rather peeved that it isn't actually a two-hour video as advertised. It's the same shorter piece repeated several times, which  would be okay if it was just the birds/critters repeating, but they left in the title sequence with talking and a stupid commercial for a cat toy. I won't be buying any more videos made by this company.",1309996800,2,357,4.578125
8045918,4,B00078XIUO,This video is not the highest production quality but the cats love it. I foster cats with a cat rescue group so have many different cats in my home. When I put it on I always have one or two watching TV and enjoying it no matter how many times they have seen it before.,1285977600,3,269,3.909090909090909
8045919,5,B00078XIUO,I'm a human and I thought all two hours of this film were absolutely riveting. I can see why cats love it! Those little squirrels were wild!,1271635200,,140,4.222222222222222
8045920,5,B00078XIUO,"My Cats loved this Cat Sitter 2 tape...they even go up to the screen to see where the chirping is coming from...It has interesting sounds...the screen changes to a big variety of animals , so they don't get time to get bored..
Now every time I turn on my bedroom TV , they sit there hoping I have their movie on...",1268611200,,314,4.163934426229508
