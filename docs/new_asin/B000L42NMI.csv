As the professor said there are a few things wrong such as missing name/date/location captions and a few stills that don't really make sense, but the content is great. Who cares if Bradbury is not clean shaven, it's ridiculous to use that as a dissent. We're lucky to see Ray speak at all these days. Those who have heard him talk before will recognize many of the same themes and stories that he has spoken of in the past, but at least for me there were a few things I had never heard before. It makes me want to pick up my copies of Dahl, Kneale and Collier, and all the other short story writers Ray has recommended, read them, and get back at the typewriter writing stories every day. And if that's not the most important thing, I don't know what is. As Ray would say to future writers, ""Mad Love!"" and ""Onward!""",1182988800,5,948,4.361581920903955
8160137,1,B000L42NMI,"As a literature professor I view lots of documentaries about authors, from well-produced works to bargain basement photo montages.  This is frankly one of the worst I have seen.  The disk itself even appears to be a cheap DVD recordable with a label, not a standard commercial DVD.  The documentary is a collection of bland recent interview clips and lecture footage of a disheveled and often unshaven Bradbury interspersed with oft-repeated photos and fawning interview comments by others.  No one is identified with a screen caption, so while Forrest Ackerman and James Whitmore are easily recognizable, the identities of several other interview subjects are a mystery (although suggested by the context).  The camerawork is amateurish and the image jitters from time to time, sometimes inexplicably zooming or panning slightly.  The music, such as it is, is comprised of someone strumming on a single guitar.  I have seen first year film students put together better work than this.  Very disappointing and not at all recommended.",1167782400,4,1033,5.2560975609756095
