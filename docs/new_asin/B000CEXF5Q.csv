2462418,3,B000CEXF5Q,"Demon Hunter was a movie I saw the trailer for on Zombiez, a horrible horrible ""zombie movie"" Undead was also featured on the trailers, and since that movie was enjoyable, I thought, hey maybe demon hunter would be as well. No.

No it was not. It was kinda dumb, and a bad Constantine rip off (sort of).

Ok, ok, its watchable, and laughable... but they tried... I think.

For a movie shot in 18 days, its not THAT bad",1140739200,5,418,4.265822784810126
2462419,1,B000CEXF5Q,"First of all, Sean Patrick Flanery plays the lead role of this movie, not Billy Drago as it says in the details.  This is yet another poorly written horror/action movie from Anchor Bay. Aside from Dead and Breakfast, pretty much every movie they're involved with can be expected to have bad dialogue, bad acting, and usually a few casting miscues.  One of the most ridiculous mistakes is the casting of William Basset as Cardinal White. With messy hair, a ridiculous mustache, and a completely disheveled look on his face, Basset looks more like a stereotypical drunk small town sheriff than a high ranking church official.  The succubus in the movie is just a woman with devil horns, the supposedly powerful demon Asmodeus looks more like a gay heroin addict,  and Flanery is apparently wearing the clothes he stole from the Boondock Saints shoot.  The dialogue is absolute crap.  When Flanery's character turns down a sexual advance by the possessed girl at the beginning, she actually says, ""Now you must die!"" The only impressive thing about this movie is the fact that the actors can keep a straight face, although most likely they're wondering how they ended up in such a terrible, terrible movie.",1140739200,7,1203,4.901477832512315

2462433,3,B000CEXF5Q,"The Devil (Billy Drago) is having trouble impregnating women in LA in order to have a demon spawn. It seems every time he gets one pregnant, Jake Greyman (Sean Patrick Flanery) our demon hunter kills them. Jake, we later find out, is the a half breed from a fallen angel. He works for the church who teams him up with a nun, Sister Sarah (Colleen Porch).

The film starts out with a very campy exorcism with a priest stringing together Latin phrases, occasionally sprinkling water on a Latino girl (Lea Moreno) whose mother prays profusely downstairs.  I was laughing rather hard at this opening scene, however the camp value did not maintain that high level.

A short film that really doesn't make it as a horror or comedy.

Parental Guide F-bomb, sex, nudity (Nancy Yoon + others including FF)",1388620800,,795,4.697841726618705

2462435,3,B000CEXF5Q,"I watched this because i am a fan of Sean Patrick Flanery. I wasn't expecting too much out of the movie having seen a preview and knowing it would be mediocre at best. Some parts are really cool, some parts though i was laughing at the silliness of the effects. The acting was good, and the movie reminded me of the Blade movies with demons instead of vamps.... But i like the Blade movies, which is probably why i like this one too.

If you're expecting a top dollar movie, you'll be disappointed. If you're willing to look past the cheesiness and a couple completely unrealistic special effects, and focus on the acting and plot... Then the movie is really good. I'd recommend it.",1371945600,2,682,4.5
2462436,5,B000CEXF5Q,"Blade meets Constantine giving birth to this butt kicking better than expected movie, full of hunter vs demon goodness packed with action from start to finish. The demon hunter is like Blade, and Constantine rolled into one, the hunter himself is half demon half human which makes frr an interesting situation and ads to the plot. Paired with a nun by the catholic church the two work together.( Billy Drago ) is deliciously evil as the demon out to impregnate as many females as he can to create half breed demon human spawn, many of the woman die though. When watching this pay close attention to the nun there is a mind blowing secret there. all in all this is a freaking fantastic movie that I enjoyed very much",1371600000,,715,4.550387596899225
2462437,3,B000CEXF5Q,"<strong>Demon Hunter</strong> (Scott Ziehl, 2005)

Another of those ""Stephen J. Cannell, what were you thinking?"" direct-to-video horror cheapies Cannell churned out like he was trying to be Roger Corman during the middle of the last decade (one of which, <em>The Garden</em>, actually found its way into theatres, presumably by accident). If you've seen any of Cannell's more cheaply-produced TV shows, you've got a basic idea of what you're going to get from these movies, save that there will of course be more nudity and more graphic violence. Of those I've seen, <em>Demon Hunter</em> is actually the most satisfying on a number of levels, which probably has to do with the quality of its cast.

Plot: Jake Greyman (<em>The Boondock Saints</em>' Sean Patrick Flanery), a half-human, half-demon who makes his living as a demon hunter for Mother Church, is hired by the somewhat paranoid Cardinal White (<em>House of 1000 Corpses</em>' William Bassett) to figure out whether a demon is behind certain recent events. To keep him in line (well, as much as possible), he's assigned a chaperone, Sister Sarah (<em>Baby Blues</em>' Colleen Porch). Needless to say, the two of them find out pretty quickly that yes, the demon Asmodeus (<em>The Untouchables</em>' Billy Drago) and his sexy henchman, a nameless succubus (<em>Something's Gotta Give</em>'s Tania Deighton), are behind etc. Ultimately, it seems, the demons are after Nancy Lebinowitz (<em>The Hard Easy</em>'s Nancy Yoon), the widow of a billionaire arms dealer, and the demon hunters have to figure out why.

The draw here is a surprisingly solid cast of B actors; it's likely you're a fan of at least someone in this cast (I watched it because I adore Colleen Porch ever since <em>Baby Blues</em>). It helps that the director at least known his way around a camera; Ziehl does low-budget genre work (he's best known for the Rob Lowe vehicle <em>Proximity</em> back in the nineties), but he does it pretty well. Both of these things help balance out the kind of horrific script turned in by stuntman Mitch Gould (recently seen jumping around, falling, etc. in <em>Twilight</em>); both actors and director do the best they can given the material, and in the end, they come up with a watchable movie. It's not great cinema, to be sure, but I've seen a lot worse. ** ",1329264000,2,2325,5.0785340314136125
2462438,5,B000CEXF5Q,"Sean Patrick Flanery is great as a Demon Hunter charged with ridding the world of demons. Fast paced and full of excitement. This is a fun, not to be taken to seriously film.",1311292800,,174,4.303030303030303
2462439,5,B000CEXF5Q,"I bought this dvd on a whim, because I think Sean Patrick Flanery's a decent actor and the topic interest me. I felt somewhat discouraged by all the reviews, as they were so negative. But man, am I glad that I bought this...
After reading some reviews I was expecting some silly implausable story with ramshackle acting, but that was absolutely not the case. Everything looks good, the acting is good, the story is interesting and I really enjoyed this film. As for the demons: 'suspend your disbelief' and simply enjoy the ride!!!",1281484800,2,531,4.720430107526882
2462440,5,B000CEXF5Q,I am a HUGE Sean Patrick Flanery fan! This movie is packed full of action. Sean plays Jake Greyson who is half demon and half human. He is on a mission to kill all the demens that were pregnanted by the lust demon Asmodeus. Will Jake win the battle or will he lose? Watch and see for yourself. (There is some good laughs in this movie too!) If you are a Sean Patrick Flanery fan you should watch this movie!,1279929600,2,407,4.1

2462442,3,B000CEXF5Q,"It has been many, many years since I saw this film.  I'm fifty-one now and probably saw it when I was ... hm ... 8.  I remember very little about it other than the fact that it stars Bestoink Dooley, who hosted the BIG MOVIE SHOCKER on Channel Five (WAGA-TV) in Atlanta on Saturday nights.  Apparently he made this film to cash in on his notoriety.  I am glad some folks were able to locate copies of it.  Hopefully, it will eventually surface on dvd.",1271808000,,451,4.258823529411765
2462443,1,B000CEXF5Q,I only watched it because it was late and there was nothing else on. It's very bad movie. I'm disappointed that Sean Patrick would go from Boondock Saint [ AMAZING ] to demon hunter in a crappy film. Sad day.,1199404800,,208,4.225

I will have to say this is light years better than Uwe Bowles BloodRayne>THAT IS THE WORST FILM EVER!!!!!!! Dont waste your time or cash on this flick.

2462445,1,B000CEXF5Q,"Demon Hunter is as lowest of the low as you can get in terms of low budget horror that fits right at home as a Sci-Fi Channel original movie.  Sean Patrick Flanery stars as a human/demon hybrid who hunts his own, and has his sights set on a very evil demon (genre stalwart Billy Drago) in this shlock fest.  Now, I don't have anything at all against low budget horror/thriller/sci-fi films, nothing at all.  However, Demon Hunter is so bad in terms of story and some atrociously laughable dialogue that you'll be busing a gut when you hear it.  Flanery is servicable and appears to take the material seriously enough, but one wonders how he got stuck with this bomb.  At a very, very brisk 78 minutes running time, Demon Hunter is over before you know it even begun, but mercifully that's a good thing with this film.  All in all, Demon Hunter may be good for an unintentional laugh, and that's it.",1164844800,4,898,4.478527607361963
2462446,4,B000CEXF5Q,"""Demon Hunter"" is NOT, by any stretch, a great film, but I enjoyed it for some serious action, and a better plot than most of the indie schlock of this genre.

2462449,1,B000CEXF5Q,"Somewhere along the line, DEMON HUNTER might have seemed a good idea:  a halfbreed demon (he's half human too) is called on by the Catholic Church when exorcisms fail.  This halfbreed, Jacob, has his own way of dealing with the possessed, using martial arts to the nth degree and usually killing the possessed.  Stephen J. Cannell, the producer who brought us THE A-TEAM, and has written several good Shane Scully novels, is responsible for this gloriously ill written and acted bomb.  And why Sean Patrick Flanery, a decent actor, agreed to star is baffling.  While he manages an aloof Clint Eastwood-style delivery, his dialogue is so horrible and his script so erratic, he gets lost in the mire as well.  Even at 78 minutes, DEMON HUNTER seems too long!",1140825600,8,756,4.821705426356589
