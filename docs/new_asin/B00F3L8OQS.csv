5966330,5,B00F3L8OQS,Mill Creek does it again.  The final 33 episodes of Season 1 for Heathcliff.  I only hope that we will see Season 2 real soon!,1386374400,,126,4.0
5966331,5,B00F3L8OQS,"Its seems like it took forever to get these episodes. After watching them all, this product was well worth the wait! I am hoping that dhx media will release season 2 soon. Packaging has improved since the previous release(season1 volume1).  With this set you get 33 episodes, no special features and pretty good quality for a tv show from the 80's!",1381968000,,348,4.704918032786885
5966332,3,B00F3L8OQS,"i am appreciative that Mill Creek released this set.  I think that they released something that others might not have taken a chance on.  i also appreciate their releasing it in a timely manner.

That being said, I must say that the packaging for this Heathcliff release will unfortunately be poorly received.
People will feel the discs will get scratched if they are put one on top of each other with this design.
I think people find the packaging to be OK that was used with the previous Heathcliff release.

I hope it will be beneficial for Mill Creek to release the rest of the series.",1380931200,5,589,4.528301886792453
5966333,5,B00F3L8OQS,"This has the rest of season one episodes more Heathcliff, Spike, Riff Raft and his gang with more adventures and gags.",1380758400,,118,4.666666666666667

8612002,5,B00F3L8OQS,"It, along with part one of season one, both came before the ETA, which surprised me. The DVDs play perfectly. The only complaint I have is how the DVDs are just stacked one on top the other, but it has not scratched other otherwise bothered the disk's ability to play, so it's only a minor peeve.",1414195200,,296,4.303571428571429

8612006,4,B00F3L8OQS,I like it . I love having the rest of season 1 on dvd now. However it appears that Millcreek decided to edit out the bumpers that would occur before and after commercials. And they did not do a perfect job so you actually do get a frame or two of a bumper every now and then if you press pause. Also you can get one single bumper that they left in....HEY MILLCREEK WE WANT THE BUMPERS LEAVE THEM IN! Ok so you can go to youtube and hopefully find some im sure. For now GOOD JOB for keeping your promise Millcreek and putting this out. Can we squeeze season 2 out of you?,1392508800,,570,4.008771929824562
