6992946,5,B00SV06VLS,"Iranian. Vampire. Western. The first movie in a long time that I was fighting tooth and nail to see on the big screen. I'd heard buzz about it, and its female Iranian director, Ana Lily Amirpour, for half a year now. Shot entirely in black & white in the California desert (which is very obvious if you've ever driven through it), it's set in a middle-of-nowhere, Iranian town, called Bad City. The place is full of deviants, pimps, and thieves, and we meet Arash (Arash Marandi), the one young man in town trying to rise above the rest, especially his drug-addled father, Hossein (Marshall Manesh). Behind all the depravity, however, bodies are piling up as an unknown menace begins attacking during the night.

In comes The Girl (Sheila Vand), likely my favorite on screen character in years. Dressed in a loosely flowing chador, akin to a Dracula cape, the Girl reveals herself to be a music-loving, skateboard riding, sneaker-wearing vampire trolling the streets to select her next victim. The best part is, we don't focus on her desperation to kill or maim or feed. In fact, it's the bad male element that she'll come after first, without all that tortured remorse. Arash and our vampire's lives intersect mid-way through the film, and not surprisingly, she's immediately taken with him. What follows is my favorite sequence of scenes as these two, lonely souls come together.

I didn't expect this movie to make me giddy with happiness. I expected some horror, plenty of blood, and maybe even some boredom--but never pure delight. But that's what I got. Maybe I'm just a romantic, our lovebirds' chemistry, so innocent and so sweet, completely sweeping me away. The music also drives every scene and sets a very distinct tone. Jumping from a Nino Rota-esque score to Iranian pop to American alt rock, Amirpour paints a picture that has elements of David Lynch, old spaghetti westerns, and my personal favorite, Elia Kazan. No one did troubled youth like Kazan. Regardless of the style hybriding, it all contributes to this vision of the Girl as the avenging guardian angel of Bad City.

My only qualm is a small one. This city, supposedly ridden with bad characters, seems awfully small the way that Amirpour presents it on screen. Maybe that's because we only ever see the same six people. No major crowds, just empty streets, with the same lone souls walking the night. Thankfully, each of these souls are memorable, and each share special scenes with our quiet, quirky vampire. My favorite being the young street urchin, when the Girl scares him into being a ""good little boy."" I can't wait to watch this movie again; it will absolutely be one that gets added to my collection so I can show anyone and everyone who will let me.",1425859200,64,2736,4.817021276595745
6992947,5,B00SV06VLS,"I saw this in a theater in Los Angeles, went in cold not having seen a trailer and was only vaguely aware of what it was about. I left thinking that this is the most beautiful, stylish and original film I've seen in forever.

People often ask is there a film you wish you made? I'm going to have to say that among contemporary films, this is it. A lot of b&w films filmed recently look really flat. This is lit beautifully and wow are there some breathtaking shots in it. The story is a tale of love and loneliness set in a fictional Iranian town (it was actually filmed in central California) full of drugs, crime and terrible people. I'm not Iranian, don't speak Farsi but didn't find this film hard to follow at all and was completely enchanted by it.

Highlights include an Iranian Ninja (from Die Antword) lookalike villain and a trench on the edge of town full of discarded corpses. Loved, loved, loved this film and can't wait to own it when it comes out. Highly recommend.",1425600000,33,980,4.4088397790055245
6992948,4,B00SV06VLS,"Certainly one of the most interesting and unique films of 2014, this is the first Iranian Western Vampire film ever made which I can say in confidence. The blending of different styles while using stark black and white film, music straight from Spaghetti Westerns and even hints of 1950s urban street films makes for a very interesting experience.

The plot is fairly straightforward, a young man finds that the local drug dealer has taken his vehicle away as payment for his father's addiction to the drugs he sells. While making arrangements to get his car back, a mysterious young woman intervenes and as it turns out she is a vampire bent on cleaning out ""Bad City"" of what she considers the filth which happens to include the drug dealer. It's not surprising that the young man and the vampire fall in love which complicates matters considerably.

There are some incredible shots in the film, including the vampire riding a skateboard through the middle of the darkened streets of ""Bad City"" and most impressively the stream bed which is full of human corpses that go seemingly unnoticed by the townspeople. There are plenty of characters in this film with lots of back stories that unfortunately never get fully realized.

The film itself may not be entirely successful simply because it relies so much upon style with not much in the way of substance. Despite its many different influences a very straightforward film that is simple to follow and interesting until the end. Perhaps the most amazing aspect is the fact that while the film is set in a fictional town in Iran, it was actually shot in Bakersfield, California.

I really enjoyed this movie and feel that with just a little more work it could have been a classic. As it is, ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" is very impressive and for those who love style this will be a very enjoyable experience.",1425168000,3,1866,4.75
6992949,4,B00SV06VLS,I saw this in the theater in New York City.  Interesting to think this came out of Iran.  Not what I would expect.  Has the look of Sin City with its simple shots and being in B&W.  Looking forward to seeing in again once it comes out on DVD.,1423699200,4,242,3.877551020408163

6992951,5,B00SV06VLS,"This is an Iranian language film (with English subtitles) about a female vampire who stalks people at night that was directed by Ana Lily Amirpour in 2014. The film was actually filmed in the US though, with the creation of a make belief, downtrodden oil town called ""Bad City"". This was a surprisingly interesting film that is beautifully filmed and directed. It is an intimate portrayal of a woman that one can't help feel is symbolic in its depiction of women living in a society that forces them to conceal their personality. Walking at night she remains shrouded with her veil, but inside her small apartment she displays all the contemporary popular interests of a young woman looking at the world around her. Bright posters adorn the walls and popular music is played on her record player. These are things that could be found in any young western woman's room. On one level it feels that the female vampire represents the empowerment of a woman living in a repressive society. Eventually through a chance occurrence she meets a young man who has his own problems, coping with a father who is addicted to drugs. Dressed up as Dracula for a party he becomes lost on the streets and meets the female vampire. This witty matchmaking leads to an unpredictable romance. The film reminds me of something Jim Jarmusch might dream up. It is intimate, humorous, and delicately assembled.

This is a nice set which includes a graphic novel, an essay, and numerous interviews with the director and actors, including one with Roger Corman interviewing the director. Also there are deleted scenes, and a stills gallery.",1514246400,,1613,4.865454545454545

6992956,4,B00SV06VLS,"This is an unusual film most likely to please or disappoint with not as much room for middle ground as some movies.  It is basically an Iranian-made vampire movie featuring a single, young female vampire hunting in a bad town.  She seems to focus her kills on the towns undesirables. There is a human/vampire romance and even a touch of humor with the skateboard scenes.  Its filmed in black and white to good effect.  Its long on atmosphere and character, and not so much on action, blood, or even plot.  There are English subtitles which are not a big issue as the movie does not overly depend on dialog.  This is one where you might be served reading a number of reviews and even watching the trailer a couple of times to decide whether or not to invest the time.  But, if you like vampire movies, and like the idea of something different, then its worth a try I think.  I give it 4 out of 5 mainly based on the imagination the film shows in bringing some new twists to what can be a tired genre these days.  Theres no swearing, a hint of prostitution, and just one very brief flash of nudity, but there is some frank hard drug use.",1509062400,,1135,4.316037735849057

6992970,4,B00SV06VLS,"* spoilers *

A mysterious girl walks the streets at night, punishing the wicked and protecting the good in the Iranian town Bad City, a cesspool of pimps, thieves, prostitutes, and other criminals. Arash is trapped in the city living with his heroin addicted father. He deals drugs, but he does it to survive and his ambitions lie elsewhere. Instead of following his dreams, he's stuck in Bad City cleaning up his father's messes and paying back his debts. Arash and the girl's paths eventually cross and a kind of romance blossoms. While this is happening, bodies are found with increasing frequency.

I've heard nothing but good things about this film, so I was eager to watch it. The cinematography is beautiful and artistic. The film is entirely in black and white, which makes the use of light and shadows all the more effective. I could have watched it happily on mute. The story moves agonizingly slow at times, but it was like slowly opening a gift that reveals just a little bit of itself as you tear more and more wrapping. There is no real explanation of the story. Where are the police? Who is this girl? Why is she there and what are her motives?

Sheila Vand kills it as the girl. The chador she wears outside only reveals her face, leaving the rest of her a mystery. The loose, flowing garment is like a superhero cape, but also like Dracula's cape, which brings to mind classic vampires from the Bela Lugosi era of film. This film takes those classic vampire expectations with her outerwear and then reveals it to be false when we get to know her more. Underneath, she could be anyone. She wears comfortable clothing, usually a striped shirt, pants, and comfy sneakers. She loves riding her skateboard and listening to music alone in her apartment when she isn't exacting revenge or dissuading wannabe criminals or evildoers.

Despite her outwardly youthful appearance, there's no questioning the girl's age and experience. She carefully observes everything and keeps herself hidden as with her dress. Throughout most of the film, she waits for others to talk and rarely initiates conversation on her own. This may be seen as a weakness, but she allows people to reveal themselves to her while she stays a blank slate to them. Oftentimes, they project their own preconceived notions onto her. She's looking for some human connection because eternity is lonely. Based on the events in the film and the giant pile of jewelry and other valuable items, she mostly runs into miscreants of various types. Then it all changes when she meets a slurry Arash and they have an instant connection. Their romance is sweet and a little awkward. It's clear that the girl doesn't need Arash to survive. She can take care of herself. However, companionship makes life more enjoyable and more bearable.

I love the role reversal that the girl poses. The title indicates something dangerous. A girl walking home alone at night is vulnerable to attack and this situation is pretty much the staple situation of any horror film. The danger is shifted in this film from the vulnerable girl to the stereotypical perpetrator of these attacks. This girl uses tactics that male harassers would make towards women, like standing and staring at them, following their every movement, or chasing them down. This role reversal either makes the targets uncomfortable or causes them to dismiss her because of her gender until it's too late. The girl is usually very stoic and quiet, but she's quick to turn efficiently violent when the opportunity arises.

A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is a unique film in black and white and entirely in Farsi. The film is clearly influenced by spaghetti westerns, graphic novels. and classic horror films. It moves slowly, thoughtfully, and deliberately. If nothing else, try it because it's something new and different. It has shades of a lot of things like Let the Right One In plus all its influences, but manages to be wholly itself.",1482192000,,3959,4.831858407079646

6992978,5,B00SV06VLS,"Finally a movie that shows exactly what filmmaking should be about. Writer/Director Ana Lily Amirpour has created a mesmerizing film with tidbits from her own life and experiences. It's nuanced. It's surreal. It's touching. Above all, it is visually stunning. Amirpour has put her heart and soul into a film featuring a great cast of Iranian-American actors.

Although it is an American film, filmed outside of Bakersfield, California, A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT is set in Iran and is in Farsi. But it is not the dialogue the matters here, it's the actors who tell the story mostly with their eyes and facial expressions along with the film noir lighting in shadows and at night.

Amirpour takes on a lot of issues in a subtle way. It's the perception of women in society that crosses all boundaries along with life in a politically repressed regime. Anyone from anywhere can relate.

There is magic in the casting, too. Sheila Vand is phenomenal at the mystery girl in the chador. It's her eyes that tell the story of the pain and loneliness of being a vampire. She wears the bulky chador open as a sort of cape or cloak and wears western clothes beneath. She even skateboards around the dismal town. Our vampire finds love and maybe redemption in the arms of another loner Arash (Arash Marandi). Two lost souls find each other.

Another star of the film is Masuka the cat who binds the various elements of the story together. It's amazing how Amirpour weaves a story of a vampire, prostitutes, drug dealers and addicts into a moving and thought provoking story. Hey, and then there is the '57 Thunderbird girl that somehow ends up in a small Iranian town. As I said, it is surreal and absurd at times but yet this is one film that totally will captivate you.",1473638400,2,1766,4.6506410256410255

  No hyperbole: The composition & style of the cinematography ranks up there with Caligari, Nosfetatu, Citizen Kane, Night of the Living Dead, Outer Limits, and the works of Jean Cocteau, Guy Madden, Fritz Lang, M. Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman and Kubrick; every shot would make a wonderful photograph, with the genius to use cinema to capture what photos cannot. For example, the dancing glamabilly with the ballon
  And the movie is also hip and cool for young-people; Girl Walks Home Alone at Night has the vigor and freshness and music of first time seeing Jim Jarmusch, David Lynch, Tarantino, and Godard.
  The use of light and darkness is so artful in reference to setting and character: think Tales From Gimli Hospital, Eraserhead, Pandora's Box.
  I refer to all these classics, but I promise you, there's nothing derivative or imitative here: you can compare here approach to the alley man to Lugosi, or her being approached slowly by her beau to Barry Lyndon, but there's no homage here; whatever influences processed are baked into something very original & perfected.
  The landscape is made to echo the situations; man made oil drills recalls either the lust to puncture & gather a precious fluid out of the body of the earth or else dehumanized sex overwhelmed by the romantic melancholy landscape- the perfect frame of lonely people finding love in a bad, nowhere town (reminiscent of Last Picture Show.) The characters are wonderful, but special mention goes to Sheila Vand command of her eyelids as an acting tool to perfectly render her intrigue- humorously so when she first meets her love interest coming from a costume party as Dracula.
  After my 20th viewing, I find A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night just as delicious as the first time; immediately charming, alarming, spooky, surprising & riveting, and timelessly masterful: an all time classic favorite for fans of black and white cinema.",1468454400,4,2030,4.9208211143695015

The story is a love story and a heart rendering one.
I remember I used to like othe vampire movies <Addiction> by Abel Ferrara, <Fascination>by Jean Rollin and <Draculla> by Francis F Copolla. But this movie became my first.
The movie is about this girl who is a vampire who walks on the street at night with her hooded black dress on.
She is searching for her prey to suck the blood from the neck to continue her living.
One day she meets this man who is more then beautiful. He has a humble job but he is a beautiful man. I say beautiful and you will feel the same if you see this movie.
But one day when she happens to smell that this beautiful man's father having shot with his lover at the lover's home, she went there and kills the father and suck his blood. He dies at once. There she takes the father's cat and takes the cat home.

Before that, the beautiful man meets this vampire girl on the street and falls in love with her instantly. But she says you don't know me at all. We cannot be together. She denies him.

Finding out that his father's death, he decides to leave the city. He goes to the vampire girl's home and tells her to join him.
But, but, but, he sees the cat which belongs to his father. He instantly figures out that the one who killed his father was the vampire girl.
His eyes were dazzled with anger for a split seconds. But then again, he loved her so dearly. He cannot but to forgive her without even telling her that he knows that she killed his father.
They drive together to live happily ever after.

The movie is stylish, cool. The music is full of house music, the editing is kind of slow but sometimes the phase of the movie is fast.
Sometimes the movie felt like a western, sometimes horror.

It is 100 munutes long but it could have been shorter. But after all, it was satisfying.

6993002,5,B00SV06VLS,"The independent film of 2015 that most embodies all the exciting rewards (and, admittedly, limitations) of indie cinema is the audacious and sometimes brilliant ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"", a monochromic black and white movie that can be described as an Iranian vampire western.  Although its dialogue is entirely in the Persian language,  in reality it was filmed in southern California (in a mere 24 days) by a young college graduate of UCLA, Ana Lily Amirpour -- a skateboarder born in England from Iranian parents.

The setting of the film is an Iranian ghost town called Bad City, a dingy town reeking of loneliness and death, in which a lonely vampire girl dressed in a religious chador mournfully stalks the desperate people of the town, often in search of love more than blood. This is an amazing film, at times breathtakingly beautiful, its style seemingly a cross between Jim Jarmusch and Sergio Leone (with some Antonioni influence in its setting of oil derricks and power plants), and it has been acclaimed by Roger Corman as a masterpiece.  I agree with him.  Although displaying some clumsy forays into experimental cinema (arguably not integrated perfectly into the whole), it displays a remarkable genius in shot composition and editing rhythm demonstrating the advantage of slow, deliberate pacing to build suspense.  Its use of eclectic music (everything from the Bee Gees and Kiosk to electronic and punk) adds to the effectiveness of the film.  Some feel there is more style than substance here and accuse it of ultimately being empty and unfulfilling, and there might be some truth in that.  But Amirpour's idiosyncratic movie teems with a wild cinematic genius that is so lacking in films today.  It worked for me.",1457049600,,1743,5.003460207612457

6993016,4,B00SV06VLS,"An interesting vampire tale that recalls elements of Universal's 1936 horror classic DRACULA'S DAUGHTER. Director Ana Lily Amirpour uses the black & white cinematography very effectively by shrouding scenes in shadows and making the stark urban settings gothic and menacing. She and actress Sheila Vand, convey the predatory nature of the vampire in subtly powerful ways, particularly in a scene where she simply keeps pace with a man walking on the other side of the street. It is an eerie sequence of predator and prey.

However, the coolest thing about the movie is getting to see the vampire skateboarding down deserted streets with her hijab trailing after her like a cape.

6993026,1,B00SV06VLS,"lord knows we  already have more than enough vampire flicks out there, but here comes  Ana Lily Amirpour with the fresh new angle of ""Twilight"" for hipsters; you know, a _cool_ vampire in a Jean Seberg striped Breton shirt with a Lillian Gish bob haircut, smoking cigarettes and skateboarding and playing '80s new wave analog records in Warholian real time.

Amirpour initially shopped around a striking eight minute short which contained the essence of what she was going for: bold, hyperrealistic black-and-white cinematography and a comic book locale known as Bad City, where an Iranian cast act out a human-boy meets undead-girl story amidst a backdrop of junkies, pimps, and assorted lowlife.

It turns out, though, that eight minutes' worth of ideas is all she had. The finished feature relies almost completely on style over substance and a tendency towards painfully looooong takes; think Bela Tarr directing ""Sin City"" and you'll be getting close.

Arash Mandi plays Arash, a wide-eyed good guy who looks like a Bollywood notion of James Dean in his white T-shirt, jeans, and classic car. He works as a gardener for The Princess (Rome Shandanloo), while also taking care of his father, The Junkie (Marshall Manesh), who's addicted to opium and has run up a large debt with The Pimp (Dominic Rains), a Satanic-looking dealer who's clad in the universal douchebag uniform of tracksuit and giant bling gold chains.

Also flitting between the characters is The Prostitute (Mozhan Mamb), although she fails to notice the other woman on the streets, The Girl (Sheila Vand), a chador-clad vampire who acts as an avenging angel, drinking the blood of Bad City's sketchiest denizens. Everybody in Bad City seems to deserve what they get from her, until the lonely girl meets the equally lonely Arash at a costume party where he's done up as Dracula; he's too cute to bite, and from there a mopey emo romance develops at a funereal pace.

Arash Mandi is a lead actor so intent on doing nothing more than striking poses that he makes ""Twilight""'s Robert Pattinson look like Daniel Day Lewis. Sheila Vand, for her part, is little more than heavy eyeliner and a pair of fangs. They're as two dimensional as anyone in Sin City, but minus the action and plot, it feels even more shallow, especially when compared to Jim Jarmusch's recent take on hipster vampires, ""Only Lovers Left Alive""; Jarmusch is as slow and concerned with cool as Amirpour, but he also fills his films with ideas and far more intriguing characters; ""comic book"" is not any sort of ideal in his universe.

Much has been made of ""A Girl Walks Home Alone"" being an ""Iranian"" film, even though the director lives in and shot the film in the United States; aside from the Farsi language dialogue, the cultural specifics here seem closer to Tarantino than Persia. Oh sure, the backdrop to Bad City is a desert full of oil rigs, and the vampire wears a chador (headscarf), two of the most obvious clichs of the Mideast you can think of. The way in which The Girl wields her black chador like a vampire's cape, infusing the common islamic headwear with intimations of evil and menace, is hardly a stereotype that needs reinforcing.

Amirpour may have a future in directing perfume commercials, but anyone whose debut -- the film she's been storing up ideas for her entire life -- is as vacant as this should consider a different career.",1445817600,7,3395,4.839655172413793

It should be at least 30 minutes shorter, and wouldn't lose anything if it was. Its incredibly slow-moving, which combined with the black-and-white, subtitles and generally downbeat storyline may have you reaching for the fast-forward button. As for the good: Everything else in the film is really quite good! The director's unusual, powerful and personal vision of the story and characters really comes through; this promises more and better work from her in the future. The cast is compelling and attractive, the Farsi language (with English subtitles) is interesting and exotic. The fictional setting of 'Bad City' (location shooting was actually in Taft, CA) isn't much realized in the film, mostly due to the low budget, but the assorted Farsi signs, tattoos and graffiti give it a nice, slightly humorous and surreal feel. The music is well-chosen and definitely helps the story along. Overall, I would recommend this film to serious fans of the vampire genre, and to people who seek out offbeat 'art' films.

The story is so-so, standard ""Iranian American Western Vampire Movie"" fare. :) What I really enjoyed was the low-tech cinematic approach to making a film that pays homage to graphic novels. Think of something like ""Sin City"" without all the CGI, shot in black and white with limited post-production effects. Instead, the atmosphere is set up with careful staging, lighting and camera work. For me, it works on a couple of levels. I'm not a big horror movie fan, but I enjoyed the story well enough to want to watch it again. It also worked on a parallel brain channel where you could appreciate the movie-making craft while the story was unfolding. I think this would be a great movie for future film-makers to study (I am not one so this may be a bit presumptuous on my part.). There seemed to be a lot of moments where you could say to yourself, ""I see what  you did there"" and appreciate the film that much more. It seemed that the director really, really has a grasp of the craftsmanship needed to put together a film using found sets and minimal post-production special effects. I think others must feel the same way...instead of originating as a graphic novel like ""The 300"" or ""Sin City"", in this case the movie came first and reportedly a graphic novel inspired by the movie will follow. I am looking forward to the next offering by Ana Lily Amirpour.

6993045,5,B00SV06VLS,"A smashing debut from Amir Lily Amirpour.  Shot on a shoe-string in gorgeous black and white, this is funny, dead-pan, creepy, punky, sweet, sly, smart, violent, sexy, mysterious, loaded with style, and the most off-beat celebration of feminism and girl-power I may have ever seen on screen.  Great use of music too.

It's a vampire story set in an alternate universe that looks like barren, poor, poverty stricken post-industrial America, but where everyone speaks Farsi, and our anti-heroine wears a chador while skateboarding through the night.  While there are a lot of genres being toyed with here (spegetti westerns come strongly to mind more than once), at heart it's an odd, sort-of love story between a feminist avenger vampire and a lost young guy who is burned out with caring for his heroin-addict father (a much older parent drug addict is only one of the many clich breaking elements of the story).

Clearly touched by David Lynch and echoing early Jim Jarmusch (though in an interview on the disc Amirpour says with charming and very funny candor that shes not a fan of Jarmusch), this is really exciting new cinema that may have been inspired by forerunners, but has a voice all its own.  For a while, Ive felt I never really needed to see another vampire film.  How many variations can there be?  Well, this proved me dead wrong.  I cant wait for her next film!

The Kino collector's edition blu-ray has a ton of terrific extras (including an entire graphic novel by Amirpour) and it looked amazing on my home screen.

We're all very familiar with the whole vampire angst plotline; this takes that tired trope and twists it such that you are never quite sure what's going to happen next during the film, which in itself is a rare and noteworthy accomplishment in this day and age of paint-by-numbers focus-grouped-to-death Hollywood-formula drivel.

There is zero crowd-pandering cheesiness, very little feels extraneous or superfluous about this film.  It's beautifully shot in a surreal black and white that Bergman would've been proud of.  Dialogue is sparse, so the visual medium is what does most of the talking.

the other factor is the nameless protagonist. it occurred to me why a vampire movie touched me so much- not because i relate to her or because i totally feel her or anything- that's not what she's about. i love her presence because she doesn't exist- she serves as a reflection of the few other characters, which is always the only catalyst in life. the girl who walks home alone at night is someone that knows us all.",1438214400,,761,4.521739130434782
6993054,5,B00SV06VLS,"I just finished watching one of the most amazing movies I have seen in a long, long, timeAna Lily Amirpors A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. Yes, I know, it only has a 7.1 currently on IMDB but, oh, this one could be a classic if it receives more exposure. Take a look at the trailer and consider watching it on Netflix or direct from Vice films.

Amirpor describes it as Iranian Vampire Spaghetti Western and I agree with the attribution if one also throws in Film Noir. This is not an egregious horror flickit is subtle, subdued, and sexy. There is a touch of drugs, a touch of violence, and a big heaping dose of good story.

Strangely enough, with the soundtrack and underlying love story I found myself even thinking of Pump up the Volume. I know the comparison is a stretch since Amirpors soundtrack is all Iranian artists but I draw the comparison in that both of these movies have introduced me to a host of new artists and expanded my taste.

The film debuted at Sundance in 2014 and is an extended version of a short film that won Best Short Film at the 2012 Noor Iranian Film Festival.  Even thought it was filmed over just 24 days in California, this is an Iranian film (in Persian with subtitles) at heart and produced by an amazing new director whom I hope goes far. It has been making the film festival circuits and nominated at numerous ones. Hopefully it may make the jump to the mainstream. I was led to it from A Taste of Cinemas 14 Movies From The Last 5 Years That Have The Potential To Be Future Cult Favorites.

This film is an absolute must see for film aficionados. I really cannot write much about it without giving it away, but I will say it has made my personal Top Ten movie list.

6993059,4,B00SV06VLS,"I love being surprised when I watch a movie. One of my best friends mentioned A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night not that long ago, and for her to mention a movie even as much as she did, I knew it was worth seeing. I appreciated that she didn't say much at all about the films plot or anything, so I went into this one without knowing much aside from a very vague plot synopsis when I was looking up the soundtrack. Not even halfway through the movie, I was in love with it. This is one of those movies where everything is so perfectly executed, from the lighting to the soundtrack to how characters react to things, that many other directors could learn a thing or two from it.

Arash is a young man in Iran with an awesome older car. Unfortunately for him, his father is a junkie and owes a seedy dealer/pimp, Saeed, a lot of money. Saeed takes the car while Arashs father continues to become worse with his addiction. One night in the car, with one of his prostitutes, Saeed notices that hes being watched by a woman in the distance. When he gets out to investigate, shes nowhere to be seen. Not long after, he encounters the girl while walking home at night, and without saying a word, she goes home with him. I guess his parents never taught him about strangers.

Thats as much as Ill say about the plot because it really is best to leave this one a surprise. On top of that, while the movie does move along at a fast pace, there are really only a couple of things that happen and I don't want to ruin any of them. When a big reveal happens for one of the characters, I was legitimately excited about it. It didn't feel forced or come out of nowhere, and was tastefully done. The movie couldve went in an entirely new direction when this happened, and Im glad they did it this way. Director Ana Lily Amirpour does a wonderful job of keeping the pace steady while keeping you interested in whats going to happen, even when nothings really happening. Theres one scene where Saeed is at a party with a beautiful girl he has a big crush on, and he even showed some class earlier by asking if it was appropriate for him to be in her room with her while her parents were away, just to fix her tv. Now hes giving her ecstasy and trying to get a kiss out of her. She resists, and the look of devastation/rejection on his face says it all, even minutes after when hes left with his drug-induced thoughts and loneliness.

While there are just a handful of actors here, all of them are great. I especially liked Mozhan Marno as Atti, an old prostitute (shes only 30!) and of course Sheila Vand as The Girl. Sheila is able to get so much across with a piercing stare and without saying a word. Shes able to do this not just during intense scenes shes involved in where somethings about to go down, but also in this very romantic scenes where the exceptional soundtrack does most of the talking. I also have to mention the gore, because just like everything else, its tastefully done. I was thinking about this earlier- does it even mean anything when you see someone get their heart ripped out in a movie any more? Like, how does someone just reach into someones chest so effortlessly, through the ribcage, and pull it out? Its boring and overdone at this point. What little gore there is in A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, is perfectly done and never becomes boring or goes too far.

If I could, Id give it 4.5 stars instead of just 4. What held it back for me was the semi-predictable ending and I wouldve liked a certain thing addressed more regarding one of the characters. We get the rules for this kind of thing all the time in movies and books, and while I didn't want or expect them to do so here, I couldn't help but wonder what the heck was going to happen with the character during certain conditions. As for the ending, it isn't bad, but during the last 10 minutes, I started to think to myself this is going to be it, isn't it? and I was right. Again, its not bad or a sudden ending like say, the last episode of The Sopranos. In fact, I guess it fits the mood and style of the film perfectly. I just wanted more.

And that sums up my feelings perfectly for A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night- I want more! Ana Lily Amirpour made one heck of a movie here, and Im definitely going to check out her other films. I hope nothing but the best for her and the actors. It may not be the #1 best movie Ive seen this year so far, but its my favorite.",1437091200,2,4446,4.238207547169812

6993078,5,B00SV06VLS,"This is a film I wanted to watch back in mid-2014, but there were no theater showings nearby and I had to wait until it hit VOD 9 months later. A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night provided multiple reasons for me to desire to see it. For one, it comes directed by a woman, which is still a rarity in the genre despite more and more females in the directors chair. Also, it is filmed in black and white and the actors speak in the Iranian language. There are several other reasons, like this being a western vampire tale, but the biggest reason I wanted to see this is because those that had seen it spoke nothing but praise. After experiencing it for myself, I now see why.

Lurking the streets of Iranian ghost-town Bad City, a lonesome vampire who stalks the townspeople finds love.

The story begins by introducing us to Arash, a young man who works hard to support himself and care for his junkie father. His fathers lifestyle takes a negative effect on Arash, who suffers at the hands of a drug dealer collecting on his fathers debt. Bad City reeks of everything that is wrong with society, and he is not alone in feeling that way. A vampire has been ridding the city of the degenerates that plague it, and she does so by sinking her teeth into their necks.

The first kill hits at the 24 minute mark, and I was honestly very impressed with how scary it was. Ana Lily Amirpours execution of this scene is incredible. From the full-frontal cinematography to the performance from the talented Sheila Vand, the tension was high and the effect is a lasting one. When the vampire, credited as The Girl, and Arash finally meet, the chemistry between the two is awe-inspiring. Arash moves the film and The Girl graces it with sincere joy and the occasional feasting. Amirpours story is not devoutly horror, as it blends love and other elements, but it is absolutely a horror film. Dont be fooled. There are several awesome kill sequences, with each of them executed in a fashion that left me shocked in ways I did not expect from such an artsy film. Actress Sheila Vands performance played a big role in these scares. After seeing her in Ben Afflecks Argo, it was amazing to see her display such a cruel and terrifying death stare before each kill.

Armirpour ensures that this will be a visually engaging piece, shot in black and white while perfectly blending contrast and blacks to give us a vintage look. The musical score plays into this atmosphere, and while at times it bled that Robert Rodriguez Western feel, I honestly did not see this as the Western film it has been marketed as. The sets used were simple but effective, and no, this Iranian-language flick was not filmed in Iran, but in Taft, California.

This story is an engaging one, but don't expect it to be consumed with vampire action. Like I mentioned earlier, we do see a few good kills, but this is equal parts romance as it is horror, and the romance will consume the second act as well as most of the third. The dialogue is minimal, yet that did not negatively affect the interaction between Arash and The Girl. At times I felt like Amirpours goal was to sell the film with atmosphere and emotion, and not so much with narrative. One element to consider, aside from love and horror, is the feeling of empowerment displayed from The Girl. Each of her kills serves a purpose. Whether she kills a drug dealer or a rapist, she is ridding Bad City of the scum that plagues it.

Overall, A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night is a one-of-a-kind experience that I suggest to those who would appreciate such a film. The direction is incredible, the horror is solid, and this is a slap in the face of those who say horror is dead / all genre films are the same.",1433289600,3,3716,4.4734513274336285
6993079,4,B00SV06VLS,"From a youngish American female writer/director with Persian family roots comes black/white film set in Iran but filmed in California. A lot of sub-theme interpretations such as isolation, desolation, cultural wasting, power and tech sucking the life out of a living host (Earth, people) and a bunch of others. All represented (symbolized) by a blood sucking vampire and oil sucking (Pump jacks) machinery. P.S. They don't actually suck the oil out but that's another story.
Very tight, smoothly flowing cinematography, acting and script.
Not five stars because of a couple of the following issues:
First, the black balloon dancer left me clueless as to that significance.
Second, supposedly in ""Bad City"", which is where all this takes place, only the bad get their comeuppance, but the father who lost his wife and seeks illicit sex and drugs out of grief or the boy who is told to be good because the Vamp will be watching him but later lies or the homeless man getting his life sucked out and finally both are male and female main protagonists having an affinity for material wealth is not a good alternative standard.",1433030400,,1122,4.941798941798941

I went into this excited to see it, because like everyone else, I was led to believe this was a true Iranian film, so I was curious to see the approach. I don't mind movies that reuse old tricks or even plots, as long as they keep my attention, and the characters are interesting, but sadly this film does not do either. Atmosphere alone does not a movie make. I first thought I was being too critical, so I suggested it to two other friends of mine that enjoy the same movies I do for the most part to get their opinion of it. One friend finished it, but did not care for it, which was what I assumed he would say. The other friend tends to lean more towards movies with atmosphere, deep meaning and art house, so I was surprised when he said he cut it off twenty minutes in.

This film and others like it follow an all too common trend that you see here on Amazon and Netflix a lot since they are today's streaming versions of ""straight to dvd"" , even before it hits pay per view. It gets an early release, and immediately starts getting 5 star ratings from people that were involved in the film and their friends and families to increase the rating from the start.

6993097,4,B00SV06VLS,"The history of film is replete with vampire flicks but few rise above the crowd. Though not for everyone's taste, ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" is a very singular outing.

Here's the scoop. Set in an Iranian city know as ""Bad City"" there is a female vampire roaming the streets and sinking her teeth into mostly nefarious types. But she meets a young man who is more genuine in his approach to life and she not only doesn't put holes in his neck, she rather likes him and allows him to get close to her.

This is a very different kind of vampire flick. First off, it's directed by a woman (Ana Lily Amirpour). It's filmed in black and white which is almost unheard of these days. And it goes not for cheap thrills but more for nuance and mood. Shot almost entirely at night, the city looks almost as though it came out of David Lynch's ""Eraserhead."" The streets are essentially deserted so when the vamp glides, slowly, up and down the streets on a skateboard she purloined from a local youth, it throws a very eerie vibe. As a Mideastern woman she does wear a shawl encasing much of her head but she applies makeup more like a pop star. So her being a weapon for women's empowerment is, in itself, odd.

This movie is not in a hurry to get to the end. The leisurely paced scenes and lingering shots will drive some viewers up the wall. But it all works well. The mood builds like a slow burn and will stick with the viewer for a long time. I can't say I understood everything that was going on in the narrative but repeat viewings will hopefully clear that up. These are some interesting characters doing unexpected things that raise the bar for this type of movie.

The gorgeous black and white cinematography alerted me to the fact that this was an art film, and so my expectations of any linear plot were suspended. The sparse dialogue is in Farsi.  The narrative is mostly portrayed visually rather than in words. It begins with a young man capturing a sleek cat-- we never find out if he stole the cat or was simply recovering his own pet. The story unfolds in the ghostly town of Bad City, where corpses lie unexplained in a large ditch.  A creepy woman lurks upon its streets.  It is hard to see if she is wearing a burka or a cape.  When she goes home with a louche drug dealer she reveals her sharpened canines and her vampiric nature. The handsome young man with the cat drives a classic car, sells drugs and takes care of his junkie father. Yet the young man and the vampire have a strangely innocent manner.  They ultimately become friends.  The cat weaves in and out of the story, providing a critical eye on human activities.

6993106,5,B00SV06VLS,"Ana Lily Amirpour is a young Iranian-American and for her first feature film takes on a vampire-themed story set in Iran (shot in California).  There are many styles and genres at work here and Ms. Amipour manages to work most of them into the story.  The place is called Bad City, located in the middle of nowhere.  Primarily an industrial town (huge electrical plant), with a section reserved for the well-to-do.  The rest of the town is desolate most of the time, especially at night.  Amipour shoots the film in beautiful black and white and on my screen comes across clear and sharp, with varying degrees of grey shadings.

""The Girl"" (Sheila Vand, ""Argo"") is a 20-something appearing vampire who walks the streets at night looking for victims, but in keeping with the religious custom covers her head (not her face) and body with a black cloak.  Bad City has some bad elements including the local drug trafficker, Saeed (Dominic Rains) who preys on his addicted customers.  One of which is Hossein (Marshall Manesh), the father of hard working Arash (Arash Marandi).  When Hossein can't pay Saeed for his heroin, Saeed absconds with Arash's mint 1956 Ford Thunderbird.

Arash works as a landscaper for one of the local wealthy families and is invited to a costume party primarily because he has acquired a large quantity of drugs.  Urged to partake in some ""Ecstasy"" by the daughter of his employer, he gets a high he's never had before.  Struggling to find his way home, he is confronted by ""The Girl"" who takes pity on him and takes him home...but not for dinner.  The film features moments of early Dracula films, spaghetti westerns, Fellini-like surrealism and even some Tarantino, all to good effect.

If I have a criticism, Amirpour often lingers too long on some scenes.  But one where it works perfectly is when ""The Girl"" first takes Arash to her home and puts on a record by the rock group ""White Lies.""  It's a mesmerizing 5 minutes you won't forget. As near as I can determine, this movie never made it to theaters beyond the festival circuit, but is available on disc and download from Amazon and Netflix.  I loved the film and highly recommend it.

I watched the film on Blu-ray disc with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  I found the black levels excellent and overall found the picture to be terrific.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it properly conveys the atmospheric spookiness of the film.  Dialog is clear and easy to follow.  Music is a major element in the film (see note above), featuring British, American and (I assume) Iranian rock music.  The film is shot in Farsi with English subtitles.  Extras are aplenty:

6993108,5,B00SV06VLS,"my wife and i just watched a girl walks home alone at night. i absolutely adored, adored this beautiful movie. filmed in beautiful black and white, a girl walks home alone at night gives us a glimpse into some of the seedier corners of bad city, including a vampire of few words, who stalks the streets on a skateboard drinking the blood of those she deems worthy of death. now, it's possible this movie has been oversold as ""the first iranian vampire film."" it is a vampire film, the filmaker, ana lilly amirpour is iranian-american, the actors all speak farsi, and it is filmed in california. whatever kind of vampire film it is is immaterial; it's a beautiful, beautiful movie.

the performers are all excellent, and, as my wife observed, the movie features ""excellent eye acting,"" as much is communicated through fleeting glances, looking away, and slow pivots of the head. the lead actress who plays the vampire, known only as the girl, is played with utter brilliance by sheila vand. at times, especially when swathed with her vampiric burqa, she bears a strong resemblance to gloria holden from dracula's daughter. the use of the burqa as a vampire-esque cape is rather brilliant; long a symbol in the eyes of many for the repression of women, here, her burqa signifies her predatory nature, and spells doom for the men who are wrapped within it. vand communicates non-verbally for much of the movie, but when she speaks, she is commanding, entrancing, and, when needed, fierce. the vampire element is subtle, but she is more than a convincing creature of the night when needed. she takes it upon herself to terrorize a young boy, to ensure he doesn't grow up to be the sort who mistreats women, is wonderfully effective, and the girl is utterly ferocious.

the rearrangement of the burqa fits neatly with the wonderful title of this movie. it is a terrible state of affairs that anyone should ever feel unsafe as a matter of being, even when walking alone at in the dark. taking this terrible reality and flipping it, reveals a very strong point of view in the filmmaker. the girl is able to intimidate simply with her comportment--which might possibly be, especially given the cultural setting of the movie, simply the fact that she moves with confidence, independence, and a sort of carefree intentionality.

a girl walks home alone at night could only have been filmed in a glorious black & white. it creates wonderfully stark and contrasting images, not to mention beautiful ones. if you enjoy shot composition in movies, this one is for you; it's absolutely gorgeous, a feast for the eyes. the girl in her black, cape-like garment disappears into shadow and explodes against white. there's never a dull moment on screen.

as it seeks to overturn various cultural norms in terms of what being a woman can be like, a girl walks home alone is also a gothic romance. star-crossed lovers from ostensibly different worlds, but really, very similar intersecting ones, must open themselves to the warmth--or chill--of one another in a dark and often unpleasant world, and the patient urgency used to get us to that place is mesmerizing. the music is also a vital component of this journey, and is used to perfection. pop with various national leanings is used to heighten emotions, and i often found myself smiling ear to ear as i absorbed this movie with my eyes and my ears.

highly engaging, beautifully put together, smart and thoughtful, a girl walks alone is a fine example of what horror can be, how themes of lonliness and isolation, as well as love and progression, can be handled with patience, maturity, and that really pleasant and familiar darkness that appeals to so many of us, a darkness that we, or at least certainly i, often require when ingesting truth.",1429920000,,3778,4.815100154083205

This movie is made in a similar vein to ""Let the Right One In"" (Swedish version). The heart and soul of this movie revolves around a very damaged boy (Arash) and a nameless vampiress. Their is not a lot of exposition , the dialogue is sparse and long stretches of silence punctuate the film. The actors are excellent at conveying emotion through gesture and gaze. The black and white cinematography are used to great affect and create an excellent sense of lifelessness in this wasteland like city. My only complaint is that the b&w couldn't really erase all of the american feel of the set (like the I am dracula scene, the actors made me forget, but I felt unnerved at first). There is very little in the way of violence of this movie, don't expect a blood end sequence, but the supernatural and unnerving punctuate this film. The ending can be confusing, as you are uncertain how much Arash understands.

6993116,1,B00SV06VLS,"I kept hearing how great this movie was and finally broke down and spent my money to see it.  It was incredibly boring and had no plot.  They keep pushing thos as some Iranian movie but in reality it was shot in California.  I cant even find any information on if this was even shown in Iran.  i think it was a great marketing ploy to get people into the theater.  Also it was put out by Vice.  Ive kinda come to the conclusion that Vice has really built up an incredible following and the people who like Vice will not only believe anything they print as news(yeah they have really turned into a propaganda machine the last few years) they will also just go along with any garbage movie they put out and say how great it is.

Ok its black and white.  Great that always makes the arty farty crowd happy.  Amazing how you make everything black and white and suddenly its just amazing and artistic.  Big deal.  But hey they threw in a ridiculous amount of jj abrams lens flares and black and white.  Holy cow they just cranked the artsy nonsense to 11.  Great job!

6993123,2,B00SV06VLS,"Reportedly a cinematic realization of a dream, Writer/ Director Anna Lily Armipour ultimately erects a wall of indifference in A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night by creating characters that are never fully realized and that we only vaguely know. It can be argued that this is the nature of the vision and that by doing this Armipour is suggesting that we feel a connection to those who populate our dreamscapes more than personally know. This may be true but by placing no connection on the James Dean type male lead, a twenty-something named Arash, and the female vampire, The Girl, who are drawn together against a backdrop of overly sugary vintage music which sounds like its fresh from the 1980s. To make matters worse it seems Armipour is checking out every artificial bit of sentiment that ever dripped from two on-screen lovers lips as they meet and gradually fall for one another.

 This is the type of film where none of this really matters. It is about the experience of watching a gorgeously shot, crisp black and white film that echoes and mimics the works of numerous cinematic giants. Italian directorial master Federico Fellini is mirrored often here, as in one rather beautiful artistic shot where a woman dances with a single balloon over a depreciating backdrop, and in a repeated scene where an oil drill sways back and forth against an indifferent sky and we also get many long shots of The Girl staring from far away which work nicely as individual images (and have been done so often and similarly they have become film staples). The comparison to Ingmar Bergman, especially in the theatrical way the story is set and the many lingering shots of the leads faces and drawn out shots of vacant spaces, is undeniable. We get a sense of David Lynch in some of the more random images (none of which we haven't seen done better and more effectually beforehand). There is also a feeling of a fondness for the films of the 1950s in the way that it focuses on a small town, aptly titled Bad City (which, I believe, is supposed to be a symbol of the corruption in the characters hearts and in the world around them and how that allure both repels and brings them together), and has the archetypical sub-plots many of the leads in motion pictures from this decade face (i.e. Arash has a sick, confrontational father at home who, in one of the more intriguing moments in the film, talks to his cat as if it is both his wife and his son simultaneously).

 The problem is not so much that Armipour has taken so heftily from those before her, but that it all reeks with imitation. It is as if the director wants to get us to adore her work based simply on a nagging nostalgia for these past mechanisms, a feeling she obviously shares based on the great variety of cinematic arenas she has borrowed from here, but this sensation is always at the forefront and only pulls us further away from the mostly tired events occurring on the screen and never engages us whatsoever in the proceedings. The story itself is just as routine as the hopeless artistic to the point of mediocrity sights which dominate the screen and that only holds us back more.

 Was this intentional? Is this part of the surreal metaphor of the decay of youth (most pointedly marked when Arash is dressed as Dracula and giving out drugs at a party and thinking he is a danger to the woman who is herself a true vampire)? Are we supposed to be held back in this manner as responsible for this decline by being part of the species which is creating this deterioration on Earth and not doing our best to do anything about it and as a way of inwardly looking at our own sentiments and how we carry them?

 If so, these are all fascinating questions and I admire Armipours ability to not hold our hands and give us every answer we need to wonder back into the safety of our own lives after A Girl Walks Home Alone at Nights 101 minutes are over. It does ultimately give us something to ponder and may not be quite as safe as it originally appears though I have a nagging suspicion this is just looking for depth where none truly exists and what lies beyond the striped curtain of the chronicle is hollow.

  Even if there is truth to these suggestions it does not change the fact that it is a movie that you appreciate more in its bits and pieces as a whole. The screenplay delivers nothing new and relies on sights far less groundbreaking than Armipour wants us to believe they are. Perhaps with a second viewing, things may become clearer and the obscure fog of familiarity may be less visible and, in turn, these inquiries may find their solutions. Regardless, it does not change how routine it all feels despite its fervent peppering of falsely artistic instances.

  Like the dream that inspired it this movie lingers slowly, far too slowly, and one cant help but think without all the emotionless glimpses of faces (which also evoke a Pier Paolo Pasolini vibe), unnecessarily drug out scenes of people walking, dancing to fill the run-time in an expression of fictional cheer, and spouting the usual romantic film clichs all we would be stuck with is a story about a boy meeting a girl, falling in love with a vampire while the male leads father falls into madness. In this day and age that is the definition of a pop culture narrative stereotype.

  Could making the initial story the epitome of what would sell for mainstream literature and film itself be part of the meaning of the ever-present deterioration and a larger meaning that we can only vaguely grasp?  Is it all just a correlation of elements of the dream or are all the artistic images meant to distract us from the reality that this is essentially the umpteenth time this tale has been repackaged?",1428883200,3,5738,4.576023391812866

6993139,5,B00SV06VLS,"The story here is one weve seen before. Another vampire / human romance. But they keep it very interesting with a bizarre setting, an amazing art style and elegant storytelling. Possibly some minor spoilers to follow

As I said, the setting is intriguing. I loved the strange mix of Iranian culture and 1950s Americana. The two opposing ideas meet in Bad City, creating a perfect backdrop for conflict to unfold. Also, the film gets major points for the visual reference to Breakfast at Tiffanys at the very end.

The art style is very simple. Many movies try to be artsy by shooting black and white, but I rarely feel the black and white is necessary (Nebraska). Here I felt that it was justified. The lack of color creates a striking contrast that helps to highlight their superb character designs. The Girl is so iconic, I feel like she could be a logo for their production company. Seeing her as just a black triangle gliding down the street on a skateboard was one of the best images in the movie. I wish theyd used the skateboard a little bit more.

The storytelling here is top-notch. I say story-telling but they don't overtly tell you anything. They show everything, never relying on lazy exposition through dialogue. Each scene feels almost like a time lapse, showing the characters slowly morph into something new without a need for any dialogue.

I have to highlight two of my favorite scenes. The first is when the Girl rides home on her skateboard for the first time, black cloth billowing behind her. Without a single word they establish through image that shes a dark, unconventional superhero, flying away to scare someone else into being a good kid or to stop another injustice in Bad City. While she clearly protects women as a priority, Im going to suggest a theory of mine. Judging by her manner of dress compared to everyone else, I think she may be protecting traditional Iranian values from the influx of 1950s Americana. This of course creates conflict when she becomes fascinated with a man (the protagonist) who could easily be the moody Iranian version of Fonzie.

The second scene occurs when the protagonist and the titular Girl go back to her apartment. Without any kissing or cheesy sex scenes or awkward dialogue, we see the development and growth of their budding relationship right before our eyes. The Protagonist glides up behind her, slowly moving closer and closer along with the hypnotic music. Just as slowly, the girl turns around. We see her make the decision to leave him alive as she bares his neck but then leans her head on his chest. We see a visual metamorphosis of the characters as they both make life-altering decisions, without any dialogue required.

The movie isn't without flaws. The pacing is very slow. While I loved many of the scenes that take their time to develop, there were a few that I felt could have been shorter. This film definitely isn't for everyone and could come off as boring and pretentious. Youll be disappointed if you come in expecting blood and guts. You might even be disappointed if you come in expecting another Babadook. But if you want to watch a simple and elegant picture about unique characters developing against a backdrop of subtle horror, this is the film for you.",1428019200,17,3255,4.752212389380531

Nothing compares to the way this story was told. If I had to rank it as a vampire movie it'd be my favorite vamp movie ever, not that I have many. Beautifully shot, beautifully told. Just an awesome story told in such an unconventional way. Everyone should definitely check it out.",1427500800,,424,4.653333333333333

6993153,4,B00SV06VLS,"Subtle yet brilliant, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is the best vampire film I've seen since Let The Right One In.  Leave it to a foreign language film to get the genre right again - Hollywood can't touch them.  Girl presents us with a softly-lighted, darkly-twisted, sparsely-worded story of a girl who probably shouldn't be out at night alone, until you realize she is the threat.  The lack of dialog is not an issue as the film fills you up with subtle colors, breathtaking views, and body language that far surpasses whatever other jibber jabber might fall into those quiet moments.  Still the subtitles are spot on when those few words flow.  Girl is an unexpected love story, delivers genuine creepiness at moments, and ties it all up with a wonderful, inviting soundtrack string that will have you feeling every moment as if you were there.  Watch it.  You will not be disappointed.",1427328000,2,892,4.716129032258064

I wasn't able to empathize with any of the characters (save the prostitute, who is great in this and in THE BLACKLIST).

It's worth seeing for the novelty of a Persian vampire.",1427328000,2,350,4.737704918032787

6993157,2,B00SV06VLS,"There's less novelty value to the idea of an Iranian vampire film than someone might figure going in.  Anyone expecting a Let The Right One In style reinterpretation of the genre is going to be disappointed--A Girl Walks Home at Night is slow going and seems to have virtually no interesting ideas regarding what to do with its female vampire.  It's also not a horror film or even an Iranian film.

A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night starts off promisingly enough--we are introduced to Arash (Arash Marandi) a put upon young man whose father is a junkie and whose most prized possession, a souped up vintage car in mint condition, is confiscated by a drug dealer/pimp (Dominic Rains in easily the film's liveliest performance) because the father owes so much money.  The vampire girl of the title (Sheila Vand) is never given a name--she wanders the streets at night alone wearing a black chador that makes her anonymous but not invisible since a woman walking alone at night is enough to qualify as unusual.

The pimp/drug dealer makes the mistake of taking vampire girl home and pretty quickly gets what he deserves.  At that early point it seems like vampire girl might prey specifically on men who victimize women--unfortunately the rest of her victims fall more into the harmless or pathetic category which makes the vampire a less sympathetic figure than writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour likely intended.

Even if her feeding choices don't make her an avenger for the rights of women vampire girl's character is empowered in the sense that she isn't afraid of men when walking alone at night.  She also feels comfortable riding the skateboard left behind by a little boy ran who away after she scared the crap out of him in the movie's best scene.  The image of vampire girl in black chador riding a skateboard on deserted streets at night is striking and one writer/director Amirpour could have milked for greater effect.

The early murder of the pimp is the only scene that suggests a horror film, the rest has the flat deadpan tone and black and white cinematography of early Jim Jarmusch, but unfortunately without his keen sense of humor which results in a movie that's drab, slow and very hard to get into.

A Girl Walks Home at Night lacks anything resembling a unique cultural perspective--the characters include a drug addict, a prostitute, a pimp and young people who like to dance and do ecstasy and listen to western music and eat hamburgers--beyond the fact that vampire girl wears a black chador in public and that the actors speak Farsi there's nothing to mark the characters here as being different from the ones in any other vampire movie. Lacking specific cultural elements all we're really left with is a vampire who seems to have virtually no personality.  A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is as free of conflict as any vampire movie you are ever likely to see and when there's no conflict there's also no drama or suspense--just stuff that happens.

For whatever it's worth A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour was born in England and raised in the United States.  This movie was actually shot in California and does not take place in Iran as people might suppose--it is set in a fictional place called Bad City which the director originally maintained was a fairy tale location not meant to represent Iran.  I mention this because things I read about this movie before seeing it suggested that A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night was the first Iranian vampire film which was either an honest mistake or a clever marketing gimmick designed to make the movie seem more exotic and unique than it actually is.",1427241600,11,3659,4.7674050632911396
6993158,4,B00SV06VLS,The best thing about it is its' uniqueness. Many of the subtle touches stick with you for a while after seeing the movie. It's not jaw droppingly great by any stretch. But worthy of the buzz it's getting.,1427241600,,204,4.394736842105263
6993159,2,B00SV06VLS,"I read that most critics and movie goers gave this film high ratings so I was looking forward to seeing it.  I felt the movie was very depressing.  It was clear that the female vampire chose her victims depending on how they treated other people and that she was watching them and judging them with her heightened observational skills.  The story was intended to get the audience to believe that there was a real connection between her and the young man she befriended but I never really experienced this. I felt it was a very odd relationship between them and I didn't really experience the bond they supposedly formed as I did with another similar vampire film (and book) called Let Me In which really developed the relationship between the young adolescent boy and the ""girl"" vampire.  I did not enjoy A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night because it just left me with a nasty negative feeling for the world they created in the film with the deserted town and the odd few characters still living there.",1427155200,5,1000,4.601123595505618

Some of the visuals are very cool, especially when The Girl is riding down the street on the skateboard. There were a few things that didn't make sense to me like the seemingly random inclusion of the character called Rockabilly dancing with a balloon, but even that grew on me after some reflection and watching the extras. The dance with the balloon is beautiful in a strange way and makes me think of the poignancy and impermanence of life and love.",1526169600,,557,4.470588235294118
