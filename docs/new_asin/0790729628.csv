103301,4,0790729628,"After seeing the Original release and then the Director Cut, I was a little disappointed.  The DC lacks the original voice-over by Ford that (imo) adds some sort of connection between the scenes.  The DC does have some extra footage that makes in worth viewing but not that much and the ending of the DC is different.  I believe that Blade Runner is still a great movie but I would have rather seen much more of the cut footage (like Decker visiting Holden in the hospital - a scene that is not in any released version) with the voice-over (narration by Ford).  Still it is worth watching and maybe adding to your collection.  END",877564800,3,630,4.491228070175438

I'm sure I watched and enjoyed this film in the theater when it first came out, but I don't think it has done a good job of withstanding the passage of time.

103379,5,0790729628,"I won't review or ramble on about the movies, it has been 35 years since the original Blade Runner, and most know what the movies are about.

I will comment, however, about the quality of the Blu Ray transfer of the movie - in Blu Ray, it is very clear and a nice upgrade from the DD - I was impressed by how crisp, clear the Blu Ray transfer was.  I viewed it on a 65"" Panasonic VT60 Plasma, and it was very nice.  Not all Blu Ray transfers of older movies fare as well.  Note this movie was shot in 2:35:1, so the transfer didn't do anything about the ""watch band"" appearance on your 16x9 screen :-( but hey, that is a common thing.  I really like the 1:85:1 Anamorphic widescreen format for home movies but we can't have it all!

What is a bonus is that after almost 35 years, I STILL enjoy the movie.  And more importantly, so do my 18 year old boys - which says a lot about how well done this movie was - it is very entertaining.  I saw the original first movie in the theaters when it first came out, and I am still entertained from beginning to end.

So here we have a timeless movie which is still entertaining today, and one where the Blu Ray transfer allows you to watch it in crystal clear HD.  Awesome.

5 stars all the way!!!

Thanks for reading.",1523836800,2,1259,4.114754098360656

If I wasn't already aware that it was made in the 80s, I might not have guessed. It is so well made and timeless. I don't know how I missed this classic until now.",1523750400,,333,4.138461538461539

This is definitely the better version of this movie to watch. It seems there are a few different cuts and the other ones don't really live up to this one. It's easy to get invested in the characters.

103400,3,0790729628,This review is of the 4K version not the movie itself which is five stars. I thought the 4K disc wasn't any improvement over the blu ray disc. There were parts where I thought the 4K looked worse than the blu ray. Over processed. It seems like with such old source material there's only so much that can be done until the benefits max out. I'm watching this on a 4K television and 4K player and feel like if you have the blu ray there's no need to buy the 4K.,1523404800,,459,4.054945054945055
103401,4,0790729628,"This movie is great for a 1980's-era film. The dolby Atmos audio and 4k are fantastic. However, the story is a bit slow, and both my wife and I had trouble staying awake through it.  Some of the writing was a bit cheesy, but very common for 80's films.  At first I wasn't sure if i really liked the film, and my wife actually wasn't willing to finish it.  However, after watching the new one, Blade Runner 2049 (which I give 5 stars), I have a much better appreciation for this film, because the second one (along with the handful of intermediate short films) really helped to complete the story.  Were it not for 2049, I would have given the original only 3 stars.  Please note that I'm not a big sci-fi junkie, and I think that it's the sci-fi junkies who overrate this movie, while the sci-fi averse actually underrate it.  It's good for what it is and what it was meant to be.",1523404800,,880,4.303030303030303

103420,3,0790729628,"This movie really highlights the danger of falling in love with the photographic ambience of one's own set design. I'm watching this woman get charmingly gunned down by the hero in super-duper slow motion, and I'm thinking, why spend all this damn time on this? Yes, there are lots of pretty neon lights reflecting atmospherically and futuristically in all the glass here, but that's just not enough, Ridley; something needs to actually be happening here or it looks like you're just milking cool-looking photography and sets.

Other thoughts, in no particular order:

* There is some cruddy writing in this movie, but the Rutger Hauer dialogue in the climactic showdown appears to've been lifted directly from my six-year-old action figure battles. I felt like I was personally culpable for it.

* This music  oh my GOD, this MUSIC! I don't know where in blazes this music belongs, but it is not within a million miles of this movie. Like all the neon reflections and omnipresent smoke, it's atmospheric without having a purpose or philosophy behind it  not that I can detect.

* Same with all the Japanese blimp-advertisement-thingies. Is there an actual deep thematic statement Scott's making here, beyond the prediction that Japan would become more influential, or did he just think it'd look interesting to throw those in the mix?

* Wow, Harrison really just doesn't seem very interested in movies, does he?

* I'm not sure terminally ill escaped slaves work especially well as villains we want to see killed, and the romance is about as perfunctory as any I've seen.

* I liked the moment with the snake dealer in a fez. All one lengthy shot (you can see the camera reflected in the window, but who cares) and the dialogue is done like it's part of the background music. That's an inspired moment.

Don't get me wrong; I love cool, moodily lit sets way more than the next guy. But don't let them fool you into thinking there's more going on in a movie than there really is.",1523318400,,1980,4.7631578947368425
103421,2,0790729628,I wasn't a big fan of this 2nd movie. I really liked the first one though.,1523232000,,74,3.6875
103422,5,0790729628,"The movie has been reviewed so often, I think I'll skip that part. Suffice it to say: if you don't know Blade Runner, get this (presuming you have a 4K TV and Blu-Ray player). It may feel derivative to you if you've watched other sci-fi titles in recent years, but remember this was 1982. If you're an old hand with Blade Runner, you won't be disappointed with this transfer. Finally, a ""cut"" of the movie (after so many disappointing ones over the years) that gets it (mostlly) right; one where the actual transfer is as good as the story.",1523232000,,540,4.4646464646464645
103423,3,0790729628,"I have enjoyed this film for years and especially love the early 80's sci fi feel that is dominates, sadly though i have to be honest,it's way overrated.
Ridly Scott knows how to make a good film. He is not a master and will never be able to make a masterpiece. Scott is split into 2 categories 1. a movie that is good-even really good--always commercial thoughEX- Alien / 2. a laughable but watchable failure that is usually unintentionally funny--(the best examples would be 1. The Duelists 2. Prometheus.
The best thing about this film is the slow, sort of druggy pace and the cinematography. I love the feel of those darkly shot 80's films especially from 1980 to 84ish.
This film is what i call a brilliant failure in that it looks great but ends up being so commercial that any attempt to legitimize it on say a Solaris level goes right out the window within the first 10 minutes of the film.
I watch this film a lot along with other film that fall in to the brilliant failure category. Another example would be Dune. It is totally flawed but the scenes that are good are some of the best scenes ever.
I have to comment on the overratedness of this movie. I just saw a special edition of this that had a Tarkovskyesque horse on the from cover. This is laughable-again Blade Runner is not an art film but it want s to be.
What made the original Alien so good was Scotts use of silence and space and slow long takes. He brings some of that element into play here.",1523232000,,1467,4.357664233576642

The setting is like Hong Kong in a never-ending monsoon, interspersed with futuristic decaying interiors. The huge cold inhuman Tyrell building and interior is just as dark, and is an inhuman contrast to the dirt and color of the very human alleys through which Harrison Ford tracks the replicants. The whole thing looks, sounds and feels dark, dirty and depressing.

So the Depression-era style hardboiled detective who drinks too much and falls in love with a beautiful but shady dame is put into the futuristic setting, but can't escape the cliches of the film noir old school detective story.

It is interesting to see how much the film ""Fifth Element"" draws from this film. I didn't know that before. Makes me appreciate ""Fifth Element"" more. It doesn't take itself so damned seriously.",1522022400,,875,4.905405405405405

It's the original theater version, slightly shorter than the director's cut with the Harrison Ford commentary, which is helpful if you've never seen it before.

Watch as Harrison Ford (played by renowned actor Harrison Ford of Star Trek fame) goes on the adventure of a lifetime in an alarmingly believable and increasingly prophetic vision of America circa 2019. Ford's journey takes him on a beautiful journey of self-discovery and critical examination of our notional concepts of humanity.

""Hey...do you remember this movie featuring a rape scene? Are they really going through with this after she tried to escape his apartment, and he slams her against the window? I mean...she definitely tried to leave and is wincing right now.""

I didn't remember this at all, but thinking back I knew that they did continue the scene. As it turns out, this film is another example where rape is normalized as acceptable behavior, even for the movie's hero / protagonist.

Despite the cool world-building, lighting, and camera work, I can no longer see this as a hallmark of sci-fi. It is an excuse for sexual violence against women. There are many other scenes where this behavior is prevalent, though arguably more subtle and easier to justify. I do not recommend that anyone watch this film.",1519344000,,1027,4.631868131868132

103959,3,0790729628,"Okay, first things first.  Comparing this film to the future that so far has developed is absurd.  If people weren't so narrow minded in their appreciation of fiction, they could have set this movie in modern day NYC or Tokyo.  But people would be confused; ""Robots don't have skin.  Does this take place in the future?""  Also, it gives the filmmakers an excuse to build exaggerated set designs and executing all kinds of visuals that otherwise would need to be ""realistic"" or be accompanied by a narrator to explain their presence.
With that aside,
The script and its corresponding visuals start out strong, and then, to my mind, gets bogged down in a siege of hardcore detective work.  I would assume in this instance that detective work does eventually lead somewhere, but I was a bit lost on what exactly he was looking for and how he came to the hypothesis that he was anywhere other than right where he started.  Also -- it's a second hand assumption that the detective work in this film is going to lead somewhere.  If one was not familiar with the concept of a story based movie, one would not have any reason to assume this.  Often, in reality, detective work, although a valuable thing, the fact is that detectives do not always find what they are looking for and the cases they are hired to solve often end up unfinished.  There is nothing happening during Indiana Jones/Han Solos' detective work except the introduction of characters who we learn nothing about and whose presence serves nobody except the screenwriter and the director.  The audience is expected to have such minimal expectations of a movie that they will have their jaw open in awe during all of this or insist on ""seeing it through"" until the end when they see how it all connects.  That's reality.  Thistles and thorns and a delicious meal afterward.  I'm not going to pay someone to deliver me a plate of uncooked fish.  I'll toil the land if i need to.  I don't need to watch this or any other movie.
This film isn't terrible.  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying this is far from a 5 star film.  There are much better ways to spend a Friday at the multiplex or home theater.  But if you've already seen them and can't think of something else to do that you're willing to, then...perhaps try this.",1518134400,,2282,4.573891625615763

A Blade Runner is a professional assassin that is tasked with the job of terminating any replicant that returns to Earth for any reason. This is a look into the future of what Earth will look like in the future with overpopulation and fear of Artificial Intelligence creations.

They gave a critical dimension to the Deckerd character played by Harrison Ford. Worse still the final scene is cut from the film which gave in another, albeit romantic, but nonetheless more human ending. It has been suggested that Ridley Scott didn't want to use voiceovers as explanations when he first made the film, but was over ruled by studio execs. The execs were right. It made the film harken back to earlier film noirs, which the entire story of Blade Runner is a futuristic version of. The voice overs play a role like photographs in the film do, as representing an interior life, which the replicants aren't really supposed to have. In fact they're programmed to self-destruct in four years when they are likely to develop them. The character of Ray, played by Rutger Hauer, is the example. Specifically cites what he has seen and remembered and it it the reason he has ultimately developed an empathy that makes him save the life of Deckerd and hopefully pass on his experiences before his dying.",1516492800,4,1142,4.743718592964824

(I am incredibly annoyed that Amazon mixes reviews for the DVD, Blu-Ray, streaming, and other formats all under the same review headline!)

In 1982 a friend and I decided to go see ""Blade Runner"" in the movie theater. Our other movie-loving friends had never heard of it and weren't willing to take the time to see it. I came out of that theater HOOKED! What an awesome movie!

Fast-forward several years and I'm in college. At the video rental store I spy ""Blade Runner: Director's Cut"" on a shelf and convince my friends (many of whom were the ones who refused to see it the first time) to watch it with me that night. ""What the heck?"" Is all I had to say about halfway through. Suddenly the enjoyable movie had become some kind of art house project! They took away the narration of Harrison Ford, chopped and edited the flow of the movie into something less coherent, and generally left a very bad taste in the mouths of my friends who had never seen it before. It wasn't the movie it had been!

Now fast forward thirty more years and I want my sons to share this movie with me. Unable to verify which streaming movie is the ""original"" I end up ordering ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut."" What a bunch of crap! Thanks to even more editing and remixing and cutting my sons will never have any appreciation for this movie whatsoever! I mean, its not like I expect them to always have clear storylines, as almost every single movie made today, but this ""Final Cut"" version is ten times WORSE than the ""Director's Cut"" was!

After that it treated me to a series of acting performances that felt so odd that made me wonder if everyone was secretly supposed to be a replicant (which I don't think was intentional?). It didn't help that the characters generally feel like they're barely more than the Noir tropes they're based on, and they were there just to drag the plot forward.

The ONLY one I recommend watching is the Director's Cut (1992).

The first movie has a hokey voice-over and tacked on happy ending. It's worth watching if you are a into costumes but that's about it.

The Director's Cut (1992) is the best because it doesn't have the voice-over or some of the weird, distracting things added in to the Final Cut version.

Most importantly, it didn't *change the language* in one of the best, most quotable scenes in the film, which I won't spoil here. I was SO upset that was changed in The Final Cut!!

Otherwise, the Final Cut (2007), does have the complete Unicorn Scene, but over all, the Final Cut is not worth watching at all unless you are a Blade Runner fanatic.",1512518400,,831,4.587837837837838

The sexualized abuse of women is terrible. A woman in a clear plastic jacket that highlights her body as she is sadistically, graphically, brutally murdered. You say, ""That is OK, she was a replicant!"" No, she was a woman! GRAPHICALLY BRUTALIZED!

In the second murder scene of a woman, her body is symbolically sexually desecrated. This is the most disgusting display of the, ""fun"" abuse of women. Then, and it shocks me Harrison Ford agreed to this, he traps a resistant woman and forces himself on her. Then asks if she loves him. Of course, after being forced, she is all over him!

104229,3,0790729628,"Simply declaring anything less than perfect is heresy, I know, but in truth this is a very, very flawed story that just happens to be gorgeously and very competently shot. It's a spectacle to behold, and the pacing is perfect - anyone who claims it's 'too slow' or thinks it 'drags on' has some issues with attention deficit (trust me, I know, I take pills for that!). The soundtrack is also fantastic, etc, etc - basically everything on a technical level is phenomenally well done That said, well...

The story is frankly very confused about what it wants to be (to be fair, even though it is VERY different from the source material, that's largely true of the book as well), the most interesting and compelling aspect of the entire thing largely happens in the background, with an ominous feel that condemns the existential questions it's supposed to be raising. Most even seem cool and meaningful on the surface, but after a moment of reflection you are left scratching your head as to why, for instance, a guy running through a crowded street waving a gun around and taking potshots at a woman doesn't even elicit a second glance let alone panic, why one replicant decides to spend her last few days performing stage shows with a snake instead of seeking the answers she came to Earth to find, or how a guy serving noodles that doesn't speak English is seconds later called over to translate, etc...

Maybe if the Replicants' story were the focus rather than Decker's, or if the writing didn't often contradict itself, or if the ham-fisted (and frankly rapey) romance wasn't shoved in where it honestly doesn't fit it, would have lived up to the hype.

104262,5,0790729628,"I'm not sure what prompted me to watch this film recently. I actually believe I was speaking with someone at Apple support about their ""personal assistant,"" and due to their recent IOS (multiple updates) that they are turning the iPhone into more of a social media device than anything else why can't they ""upgrade"" their ""AI"" rather than add 70 emogis. I mean, they more or less set the bar and yet other companies, like even Amazon, have surpassed what Apple's Siri character is capable of, and the support agent says to me ""you mean like Blade Runner?"" And I said yes!

The two-disc set is the only way to go, and the 'final cut' is far better than the theatrical release. Like many people, I didn't much care for the film at first. However, I would watch anything Ridley Scott has directed, and the two recent Alien prequels are fine examples why. Moreover, look how he has progressed with the ""artificial lifeforms"" in those films.

In the end, Ridley Scott is simply a master of storytelling & visuals. And the final scene of the Final Cut, or at least the death of Rutger Hauer's character, says it all.

This story is ultimately about existentialism and the need to survive and that rooftop scene just brings it all together. I'll never forget this film. I'm glad I bought this and was able to share it with someone. The reality is, when you tackle these kinds of questions and put it in a screenplay, it's not about how fast the movie flows. It's the content and the concept. If you expected Mission Impossible 3 you'll be disappointed. This film is not about the action. It's a thinking man/woman's movie.",1510272000,2,624,4.580357142857143
104285,2,0790729628,"BR is of course a fantastic work of art. The final cut however is rendered too dark. So dark that previously visible fabric weaves from the directors cut are now just black. Compare the chapter where roy pops ""time enough"" and asks if Leon got his photos before heading over to chews eye shop. The directors cut has a ton of visible detail, but the final cut is over saturated with green resulting in lots of blacked out details. And lots of other scenes are just very green compared to the directors cut.

Also the additions, including a cgi background insert when the pigeon flies away, are not really needed, as are the deletions of the spinner wires.
One thing fun about blade runner the directors cut is watching it again for the many continuity gaffs, and misc body parts strewn around. Who's hand was that on Roys shoulder in the phone booth?  and why does he have the nail sticking out of the back of his hand in that same scene?? And who was that laying in the tub in the final where deckard and roy show some spirit??

This was not called execution.
It was called retirement.

The film from beginning to end is treated with an overlay of original musing by the renowned Vangelis. In many films music can be a distraction or is needed to enforce spooky scenes. In this film the music is more of a co-character.

One image that staid with me is of Daryl Hannah with her fancy eye shadow.

Yes, it's long, and yet so completely immersive you actually believe that this is a world that could exist. It's one of the things I love the most about watching Scott's films. I'm always complaining that many modern films trade in character development for action and CGI and that is not the case with Blade Runner. The attention to detail from a story perspective is brilliant, and whether it is a human or a replicant you want to know more about each and every person that crosses your path in the world that's been created here. Nothing is dismissed or used as a throw away. The performances are perfection and the line blurred between the humans and the replicants are chilling to watch as they interact with each other.

6. Some supporting characters don't seem to serve much purpose (Gaff, Chew)
7. First 5 minutes and last two minutes are great, other than that, it's just borderline dull.

104361,3,0790729628,"Honestly...I thought the movie was not as great as I thought it could be.

After DECADES of people telling me to watch this, I bought it and after watching it I just felt rather neutral toward it. While visually stunning, the editing was all over the place, the acting was rather inconsistent, and the story was not that cohesive. While I was able to follow the plot, and I didn't mind the dubbing of Ford's voice too much, the fact remains that no matter what cut of this I watch I've not found myself enjoying any of them that much more than the original cut.

And then there's the overly aggressive scene where Ford's character FORCES a partner to say what he wants her to hear in order to act like he was getting consent from her.

In all honesty, I can see why people feel strongly toward it if it's one of the first movies of this type you've ever seen, but I'd rather read the book than sit through it again.",1508889600,,915,4.277456647398844

104377,5,0790729628,"I first saw Blade Runner in the theater back in 1982. The trenchcoat-wearing lawman hunting down the baddies thrilled me but nownowNow I realize I must have been in the grip of a fascist mentality.
 The reality is that Blade Runner is filled wall to wall with anti-heroes; Rachael being the exception.
 Watched the directors cut recently and was blessed in that I saw it a day after reading the New Republics review of Toni Morrisons important book The Origin of Others. For a demonstration of Morrisons thesis listen to the words of Captain Bryant in Blade Runner.
 Havent seen Blade Runner 2049 as of this writing so Im not sure how the story will be advanced.
 It would be amazing if the new film managed to pack in half of the warnings of the original. Ridley Scott saw pretty far using his 1980s binoculars  Environmental degradation (which helps transform the City of Lights  L.A.  into the City of Darkness), turning the justice system into a weapon for use by the invisible hand of monopolistic corporations, the questionable morality of genetic engineering, technology leading us back to the slave-owning mentality, anger at G-d/our maker, fake news (how accurate are the reports Deckard receives about the crimes of the replicants?), the opaqueness of peoples motivations (why did Deckard rejoin the Blade Runner force when he seemed to dislike killing? Why Gaffs in-action on Rachael?).
 Probably saddest of all is the only avenue of reestablishing trust in such a world is through willingness to do violence on behalf of each other.
 Maybe the new movie will take up Deckards possible replicant status and/or the fact that the entire Blade Runner corps may have been genetically engineered to kill the other (heres Morrisons others idea again) replicants to whitewash the failings of Tyrrell Corp. Maybe Rachael really is Tyrrells niece. Gaffs name is pregnant with possibilities. Is he someones mistake and, if so, whose?
 Ill admit to liking Deckards narration which is omitted from the directors cut. The uplifting ending is also not in the directors cut. Scott likely wanted to convey that most people don't go that route yet sit and make do. Its probably this same mentality that causes people to not walk out on violent past-times like football and hockey even when the injuries are severe and violence reaches a fever pitch.
 Yes, were all sinners. Maybe the replicants are sinners, too, although another question might be Do they have free will and, if so, how did they come by it?
 Sports are past times and as the cover of Wendell Berrys Home Economics says To live is not to pass time but to spend time. Blade Runner is a worthwhile investment of time because its important to realize where we are and why we still have much to lose.",1508630400,,2756,4.840425531914893

104380,5,0790729628,"Perhaps among the best all time films ever made, (that will eventually creep up on everyone like Casablanca).  It has depth, though dark and dreary -- (and one does wonder why Sean Young would wear a chinchilla-like coat in the pouring rain) -- but ever intriguing and interesting, and not blasted through with unnecessary sex and nudity.  This particular version was by the studio in the early 90's, sans the theatrical original's voiceover; Ridley's personal ""Final"" cut was not out until 2007.  Truly doesn't make much difference which one you get.  Yes, the later blu-ray's are sharp and clear, indeed.  But the blurry print of this one can't be help, and still lends to it's overall mystique.  The music track is also that perfect blending of sound and atmosphere and ambiance, forever superb.  A story well told, touching, and sticks with you long after.  Its truths, plainly eternal.
(And the issue of Deckard: a replicant or not?  An airy question, never solved.  The ambiguity is part of the magic.)  Enjoy.

Unfortunately, I sadly have to say, the sequel, 2049, was so convoluted I didn't have a clue what was going on from after the first kill.  Nothing after that made two drops of sense, much less ""one.""  Very, very, very disappointing.",1508544000,3,1250,4.862559241706161

Seriously what did I just watch....

EDITED: So apparently a bunch of people found the above review ""unhelpful"", so I'm adding this to clarify and add specifics. I never watched this when it was all the rage, I checked it out specifically because the 2049 one is in theaters and I wanted the backstory. Basically, I cannot conceive why there was such a fuss about this when it first came out...was it just that people's minds were boggled about robots that were rebellious or self aware??? was this like a version of dystopia that seemed cool and edgy at the time?...and I am now reconsidering seeing the new one because this was THAT BAD.

The plot was nonsensical and painful to follow. The dialogue was confusing, and the sound editing was significantly to blame. Harrison Ford did a really bad job of getting me to give a flying frack about him as a person, but then again I didn't really care about the other characters either. The startling random bits of casual racism and sexism and unexplained nudity and weirdness were jarring but not unexpected for the time frame of the film's production, but there was nothing redeeming that made me want to overlook those aspects either.

That's not to even get into the fact that the futuristic vision of technology that was presented here requires us as audience members to suspend a LOT of what we know about how technology actually works to buy into the basic premise. Basically, having a cop whose entire job it is to hunt down evil murdering robots (who are evil and murdering because they are self aware and consider themselves slaves) in the year 2019, one whose main method of discovering if they are robots is a freaking QUESTIONNAIRE AND EYE TRACKER, when our current 2017 technology would present several easy solutions to this problem -- tag all robots with Bluetooth or wifi trackers so you don't lose the murdering ones? x-ray the robots or have them go through scanners so we can detect their robotitude? make software that prevents them from knowing that they are slaves, or makes them enjoy it or be numb to it, or shuts their functioning down when they try to get all murder-y? -- is a bit too much.",1508284800,,2249,4.615

I understand that this might have been ground breaking work in its time but I also remember skipping it 'back then.'  It looked dark and depressing when it came out and it was dark and depressing now.  There was almost no dialog.  The premise is also a bit weak because it doesn't properly explain why this blade runner, who had quit the agency, was somehow compelled to come back to kill the 4 rogue replicants.  His chief just says he has 'no choice' and the blade runner accepts that as fact.  The relationship between the blade runner and the female replicant is blase and unbelievable.  There is zero chemistry and no love.  It is past believing when he asks her if she loves him and she says she does.  There is simply nothing to feel in this movie.  It rains a lot.  The sky is polluted.  The buildings are ugly.  Cars fly even though there doesn't appear to be any regulations, signs or systems in place to keep them from hitting each other.  Basically, I feel like I wasted 2 hours.  And I LOVE science fiction.  If I didn't have such respect for Ridley Scott and the place this movie plays in history, I would have given it two stars.  Maybe even one.  I suppose that's just what happens to old movies after we've learned from them and moved on.  They don't entertain like they used to.

104430,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner has always been one of my favorite movies, so it was a no brainer for me for purchase the 4k version. I had watched the theatrical, the European version, the director's cut (from 1992), but had never watched the Final Cut. By the time the final cut had come out, I felt enough was enough. It felt too ""Lucas-y"" to me. My initial thought when I discovered the Final Cut was the only print in 4k in this set was disappointment. That is until I hit play on the player. The Final Cut is absolutely gorgeous in 4k. If you like Blade Runner in any of its former editions, this one trumps them all. The audio is exquisite as well. IMHO this is the best iteration of a 4k print to date. If you're on the fence about getting yet another edition of this movie, GET IT! You won't be sorry you did.",1507507200,2,799,4.161290322580645

Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the Director's Cut version, but I get tired of all the junk they add to justify a reason to buy the movie all over again. When I bought the Director's Cut version and watched it, I felt like I had been robbed again. The movie just wasn't the same one I saw so many years before. The detective voice over goes so well with the dirty, gritty scenes that Ridley Scott took pain staking care to recreate.

Yes, this is the Final Cut version using the director's original vision, from 2007.  Compared to the theatrical release, the notable differences are there's a key scene added to the middle, removal of a dumb scene at the end, removal of some dumb voiceover narration by Ford, a little extra gore, modified lighting, and some improved graphics.  Overall, many agree this is the version to see.  Lastly, I think the movie is good and worth watching, but I question whether it should be considered a 'classic.'  Hard for me to say exactly, since this is my first time seeing it, and the movie was originally released in 1982.  I'm sure it was very advanced for its time.",1507334400,3,795,4.683453237410072

104461,5,0790729628,"Los Angeles, 2019. The Earth is grimy and grim, covered with vast cities of towering skyscrapers. Most animal life has been wiped out, replaced by expensive synthetic counterfeits. Counterfeit humans - replicants - also exist, carrying out dangerous, dirty work in the offworld colonies. For security their lifespans are limited to just four years. Four replicants have come back home, seeking to extend their lives. A replicant-hunter, a blade runner, is sent to stop them.

Blade Runner was released in 1982, a movie by Ridley Scott based (loosely) on Philip K. Dick's short novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The film had an initially mixed critical reception, but this improved with the release of the 1991 Director's Cut, which restored a subplot raising the question of if the central character of Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is himself a replicant. This cut also removed a series of unnecessary voiceovers and a studio-mandated ""happy ending"" that Scott had hated. In 2007 this version was superseded by the Final Cut edition, which restores some more scenes and tweaks others whilst completely digitally remastering the film in proper high definition (with eye-popping results).

The power of Blade Runner does not lie in its story - which is slight - but in its visuals, atmosphere and in its thematic exploration of the nature of what it is to be human. The replicants appear to be intelligent, sentient and capable of emotion, so the decision to use them as slaves is morally dubious; on the other hand they are also capricious, child-like and do not have an innate value for human life, killing those who oppose them with ease and ruthlessness. Deckard starts the film as a man of apparent moral certainty, willing to execute replicants. His meeting and association with Rachael, a cutting-edge replicant with much more human characteristics, raises doubts in him about his certainty that the replicants are soulless machines that need to be put down.

This is mirrored in the story of Sebastian (William Sanderson), who has a terminal disease and is spending his dying days creating new replicant technology for the Tyrell Corporation. This gives him tremendous empathy with the replicants, who are likewise doomed to die far before their time, and explains why he wants to help them (a decision he later comes to regret). This storyline is not as explored in as much depth in the novel - where a character named Isidore plays the same function and has a bigger role - but it does give some humanity to the replicants.

These themes of using artificial life to question what it means to be human would be revisited just a few years later in the character of Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation, but much more powerfully in the 2003 reboot of Battlestar Galactica (which also inherits Edward James Olmos as an actor and the term ""skinjobs"" for its replicant-like artificial lifeforms).

The movie's most enduring quality is its startling visuals: the vast, towering blocks of Los Angeles, the flames roaring into the sky from towers, police cars flying in front of colossal advertising hoardings. Disregarding realism (even in 1982, the idea of earthquake-prone Los Angeles looking like this just thirty-seven years later was a stretch), these visuals have lost none of their power and have even gained new power through their high definition remastering. Backed by Vangelis' haunting score, the sweeping effects shots of the city remain powerful and arresting in a way that the disposable CG cityscapes of modern SF movies cannot match. But beyond the effects footage is the minimalist way Scott shoots his futuristic, dystopian city, with dusty offices, bustling street markets and sparse apartments all looking amazing.

Performances are stripped-back, honest and raw: Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer all give career-best performances, whilst Edward James Olmos does a huge amount with a small amount of screen time. The film is sparsely-written, sparing with dialogue but making sure almost every conversation is important and memorable. This culminates in the movie's ambiguous and much-debated final confrontation between Deckard and Batty (Rutger Hauer), and Batty's soliloquy on his impending death and the loss of his memories, although he tries to impart some of these to Deckard through his ""tears in the rain"" speech.

For those who like their movies to be clear and unambiguous, Blade Runner will likely frustrate. This is a film designed to raise questions, engage in philosophical debates and have viewers revel in its slow-burn atmosphere and visuals. There are action sequences, but they are awkward, ugly and brutal rather than visceral and exciting. The so-called love story element is strange and questionable. The ending is ambiguous and, for some viewers, abrupt. But it's also a supremely assured film that is confident in its own ambition and executes it perfectly.

Blade Runner (*****) is strange, haunting and utterly compelling. There are numerous versions available, but arguably the Final Cut is the strongest, representing the director's clearest vision of the story.

A sequel, Blade Runner 2049, will be released on 5 October 2017 in the UK and a day later in the US. There are also three sequels in book form, written by K.W. Jeter, but these have been superseded by the new film.",1506902400,3,5363,5.113013698630137

104485,5,0790729628,"I was blessed to be born in an era where I could go see Blade Runner, the Theatrical Cut, in the movies.  I wasn't old enough for ""R"" rated movies, but back then, that wasn't really a big deal.  You just asked a guy in his twenties in line to buy the tickets for you, then went in while a kid from school was taking tickets.  Easy Peasy.  After seeing Runner 4 times while in the theatre, working extra baby-sitting jobs and selling donuts at the local shop every Sunday, I was a 'nerd girl' though back then that wasn't even a term.
Now, fast-forward some years, the ""Director's Cut"" came out.  Personally it was 'ok'.  Took a bit to get used to Deckard's voice being gone, but this cut was good, extra stuff, etc...
Now!! I'm sitting with my 17-yr old son in a movie theatre when a trailer starts and within the first 3 seconds of just a visual and a couple notes of music, I KNEW.... I KNEW!!! OMG!!! I actually said that out loud in the theatre... OMG! Blade Runner!!! My son looked at me, cringed a bit, wished he had a different mother for that brief few seconds, but after watching a trailer, he was HOOKED!! On the way home from the movies we didn't even discuss what we watched, and honestly I can't remember, we only discussed Blade Runner, the story, the book, the movies, dystopian films, for a couple hours my teenage son suddenly saw his stay-at-home, Betty Crocker mom as 'somewhat' cool. LOL!
This weekend I purchased ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"".... OMG!!! Talk about blown away!  I felt like a Blade Runner virgin all over again!  Ridley Scott finally got hold of everything he wanted to make HIS cut. And he made it beautifully!!!
(Note: the Director's Cut is NOT endorsed by Ridley Scott. He had nothing to do with it, has stated that on his Blog several times. While he doesn't dismiss the work, he does not endorse it)
The music, the added scenes, the lengthened unicorn sequence, and there are some twists that might surprise many of you that have only seen the Theatrical Cut.  PLUS, I sat with my son during this viewing.  He experienced something everyone, in my opinion, should experience once in their lifetime. The movie that started it all in the dystopian universe of gaming, movies, books (post Philip Dick), even the Steam Punk revolution.  My son, all 6 ft and 17-yrs old, got it!  He himself said, this explains so much in so many things I've read, games I've played, movies I've seen. A profound statement he made was ""It's like this is the Rosetta Stone of science fiction today!!!""
IF you want to see the movie before you go to ""Blade Runner 2019"" in October, THIS is the version to see or the Theatrical Cut.",1506038400,11,2648,4.470954356846473

First off, most of the 4K UHD library to date is how shall I say... pretty horrible. I have purchased most of them after buying a top of the line 4K UHD TV, a top of the line 4K UHD player, and an Dolby Atmos Surround System. Unfortunatly, I was also a heavy investor in HD-DVD, which I now see 4K UHD having basically the same fate. For starters, by the time people finally get around to understanding 4K UHD, we will already have 8K TV's, so I don't see it lasting, especially with the fact that the movies that are being chosen are so bad, with the exception of a handful. The Blade Runner 4K UHD on the other hand, is not only an amazing and timeless classic, but it also is SPECTACULAR in 4K. If you have seen this movie various times like myself, you will instantly be able to tell that this 4K transfer is legit. So, in closing, at the moment, this is really the only REALLY GOOD movie and REALLY GOOD 4K movie I can recommend owning. Get it before it is gone, cause trust me, 4K UHD will not last. It's the HD-DVD of my generation, and the Laser Disc of the generation before me.",1505520000,4,1261,4.109311740890688

104514,5,0790729628,"I know it's a cliche to say this, but I'm not sure this movie will ever look better than this 4K version. I've owned SO many copies of this movie. The old letterboxed VHS Director's Cut, the Theatrical Cut on DVD, the Director's Cut on DVD, the Final Cut on Blu-Ray, and all the versions that came with the Collector's Edition Blu-Ray version. I'm a BIG fan of this movie and have all the lines memorized.

But to my mind, there's no topping this as far as quality of image goes. The exterior shots of the Tyrell Corp. especially are as sharp as they've ever been - in part because they aren't obscured by Scott's directorial obsession with smoke. The street views come to life in a way I've never seen before, and because the image is so clear and sharp there's so much more detail to be seen.

The one strange issue I had was in the opening sequence, my TV had some dark black spots along the bottom of the screen when the fires flared during the overhead shot of Los Angeles, November 2019. I haven't seen any other reviews that mention this bizarre image problem, and I strongly suspect it may be a symptom of my cheap 4K TV's incompatibility with HDR.

The most important thing though is that this is faithful to the film. It looks like it was shot on film, and it doesn't look glossy and digitized. The whole point of 4K is to get a natural appearance that's as close to the film print as possible. I have a 4K TV that doesn't have HDR, so I can't speak to the HDR elements yet, unfortunately. However, from other reviews I've seen online, the HDR combined with the 4K elements means that this movie will probably never look superior to this version. Assuming the 4K Blu-Ray format never dies, this may be the last version of the movie I may ever buy again.

The only thing missing is extras. There are extras that were included on the 30th anniversary edition (assembled in 2007) that aren't on this one, and that means that there will probably be an ""Ultimate 4K Edition"" down the road that not only includes the gorgeous 4K version, but all the extras that will truly put the complete Blade Runner experience in one package. Until then, my advice is to hold onto your Blu-Ray version of the 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition.",1504656000,34,2237,4.4487804878048784
104515,4,0790729628,"Blade Runner finally comes to 4K! But it's not without some issues.

Right off the bat, the movie looks fantastic in 4K. You will need a 4K TV and 4K UHD Blu-Ray player to play this disc. I'm reviewing this on the OPPO UDP-203 player and LG OLED 65"" c6p model.

The set includes a slipcover, 4 discs and a digital copy code. HDR is HDR10 (not dolbyvision, from what I can tell) and audio is in Dolby Atmos (I don't have atmos, so it comes across in TrueHD).

The discs are where it becomes a mess.
Disc 1 = The Final Cut 4K UHD Blu-Ray
Disc 2 = The Final Cut Blu-Ray (this is the same exact disc from the 2007 Blu-Ray release)
Disc 3 = Dangerous Days (documentary) DVD (that's not a typo.. this is a DVD disc inside of a 4K release) from the 2007 Blu-Ray
Disc 4 = Some people get a special features disc w/ the Workprint edit.. some people get 3 cuts of the movie (US Theatrical, International theatrical, Directors cut) on Blu-Ray, also from the 2007 Blu-Ray release.

There seems to be some confusion here. I don't know why Warner is including the 2nd, 3rd and 4th discs from the 2007 release (but leaving out 2 of the other discs from that set) and not including the discs from the 2012 release (or re-doin'g them for the 2017 release).

The 2007 releases already had issues (such as compression to match the HDDVD releases) so the quality of these discs 2, 3 and 4 do show their age.

The 4K UHD disc (why you're buying this!) does shine though. The film is very grainy (a tight grain, similar to TV static) but there is a noticeable amount of sharpness, clarity, better colors and HDR used throughout. Compared to the Blu-Ray, this is one definitely worth upgrading. If you don't like grain though, this may be one to pass on. If you've seen the Fifth Element 4K release, this is similar.

Unfortunately, the extra features (many of which are presented in 480p/DVD quality) are a very big disappointment. The 4K disc only includes a commentary, intro and trailer. The 7+ hours of features are across the other discs.

The movie itself is only presented in 4K as the ""Final Cut"" (not the original theatrical or directors cuts). The Workprint cut (which many do enjoy!) seems to only be included with some sets, while others (like me) received the disc with the theatrical and directors cut blu-ray's instead.

Audio is very good. I don't have atmos, but even on a 7.1 setup it sounds great. Also included is a digital copy that redeems in 4K.

Overall, nice upgrade if you own the previous sets.. If not, this is the one to get.",1504569600,25,2532,4.414163090128755

The discussion arises as to what the ""true"" version of the film is, or of any film, when there is a discrepancy between the theatrical cut and the director's cut. Ultimately, to the surprise of many of us, the theatrical cut wins the discussion. That was probably the last time that the debate ever ended in that outcome.

In the endless myriad versions of BLADE RUNNER that exist I humbly suggest that this, the Director's Cut, is the version a neophyte should turn to as a beginning. Personally I deny knowledge of any and all of the other versions on the market and the ridiculous extravagance afforded to this somewhat overly worshipped film.

There is nothing like it and  if you ever get the chance to view it in a movie theater you will have a completely different experience than on even a large screen tv.
At one time I owned at least 16 copies in used VHS from AMAZON because I was afraid that I would never see the movie again and the quality of some of the tapes turned out to be damaged. I had missed out on buying them new.
I have seen the Directors Cut at least 7 times in theaters.
I still prefer the original version with the voice over because, for me, I would have missed some of the meaning such as the fact that Deckard was threatened with death if he did not return to the Blade Runner squad.
For me, it is the best movie of all time and Future Noir comparable with the classic Film Noir in black and white such as Maltese Falcon or Murder My Sweet or such color films as Devil in a Blue Dress or Chinatown.

104557,5,0790729628,"BLADE RUNNER, 1982. Director Ridley Scott went back into post production to create this long-awaited definitive new version, Blade Runner: The Final Cut to celebrate the 25th anniversary of this iconic sci-fi masterpiece. It is spectacularly restored, remastered from original elements. Contains never-before-seen added/extended scenes; added lines; new/improved special effectsalthough, still, no computer generated effects; director/filmmaker commentary, an all-new digital audio track and more. And even some welcome cuts. So calling this treatment of Blade Runner long awaited is actually a resounding understatement.

Its been well worth the wait. Director Ridley Scott has now created the definitive version of an iconic, visually stunning, highly intelligent film. By far its best version. Even backed  with a staggering extra features package that varies depending on for whatever version of the release you opt). But the highlight nonetheless remains the stunning film itself, which remains a testament to creative people whose thinking was well in advance of  their contemporaries.

The core of Blade Runner, of course, remains the same. It opens in the then futuristic year of 2019, Los Angeles, California. Which has become a dark depressing metropolis, filled with urban decay, greatly Asianized, where, despite its being by geology a desert city, it seemingly always rains.  The film presents an amazing cityscape proven to be well ahead of its time, with resounding visuals that defied 1982s supposed limited special effects.

The handsome young Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, ex-cop, ""Blade  Runner,""  one of the persons assigned to assassinate ""replicants. Androids that look like real human beings, have been given great artificial intelligence, greatly resemble their human models, but have been created with life spans limited to four years. Four replicants, anxious to have their life spans extended, stage a bloody mutiny on an Off World colony, steal a spaceship,  return to Earth to find their creators, call them to rights. Deckard is called out of retirement to track them down. As he does, eliminating them one by one, he comes across another replicant, Rachel, who evokes in him human emotion, despite her replicanthood. As Deckard closes in on the leader of the replicant group, he begins to question his own identity in this future world, wonders what's human and what's not.

The picture was based upon a story by Philip Dick, written by Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples, directed, of course, by the great Ridley Scott. It boasts a beautiful, emotionally evocative score by Vangelis. Leading actor Ford, then at the beginning of his long, still-prospering career, so young he sometimes doesnt look like the actor we know, carries the picture manfully. He is backed by an all-star cast, including Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, leader of the insurrection; Edward James Olmos as Gaff, Deckards odd-ball coworker; M. Emmet Walsh as their boss Bryant; Darryl Hannah as Pris, replicant built to please; Joanna Cassidy as Zhora. replicant built to fight. William Sanderson as JF Sebastian, one of the replicants designers; James Hong as Hannibal Chew, another unfortunate replicant designer.  Each actor plays his/her part with an intensity rarely seen on screen; Hauer makes his great deathbed speech truly memorable.

Heres the time for me to mention an inconvenient truth: I loved this film back in 1982, love it still, and bought this DVD to replace a VHS tape I finally had to give away.  Like the improvements, but loved the original even so. And I am well aware that those Hollywood idiots, not content with greatness, are currently remaking the film in Prague.  Now Prague is a great, beautiful historic city, Ive been there and I know, but it aint LA. LA serves as another character in the movie. It is irreplaceable, its history such as it is, its historic buildings, such as the Bradbury Building, which is heavily used in the film. And I know that compared to Pragues buildings, the Bradbury is a baby.  But thats not the point. And how can you replace young Harrison Ford  surely not with the still scantily bearded Ryan Gosling.  Nor can you replace the remarkable Dutch actor  Rutger Hauer. Or Edward James Olmos, Emmet Walsh, James Hong, William Sanderson,  Joanna Cassidy, Darryl Hannah. Sorry, I may yet be forced to eat my words, but I don't know why Hollywood insists on trying to remake films successful, at least in part, for outstanding performances.  We shall see.  Meanwhile, I have loved this film since 1982.",1501286400,8,4568,5.204638472032742

104570,3,0790729628,"Decided to rent it since the sequel is coming up. The overall plot idea is cool and the movie has some cool visuals, but the character development is pretty shallow. The main conflict isn't super developed either and leaves you wondering about some parts of the plot. There's also some weird moments where you wonder if someone's fetish made it into the movie (Like, it gets pretty weird). I can see why some people like the movie; The visual story telling, sci-fi noir theme, and the overall concept are pretty cool. But it's also easy to see why some people hate it; The plot is stiff, its slow moving, and there are some questionable filmmaking decisions. So it gets an OK from me.

Hubby watched it (reluctantly) with me, and even he was mildly impressed (not a small feat). The acting is decent, but the graphics are good (considering the time the movie was made) and the plot is certainly interesting. There's a certain amount of patience that you have to have watching it though because unlike today's movies, the noir style feeling of this movie can seem like something of a drawn out torture (cue synth music that was popular in the late 80s, early 90s).

104607,5,0790729628,"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? (1968) ...is a cultish favorite Philip K. Dick novel which young Sci-Fi aficionado's such as I went scrambling to unearth after we were mesmerized by his classic masterpiece The Man In The High Castle, the novel which brought him legions of fans.  Philip was an unusual writer with an ability to write both in a very literary style and yet come across in a very contemporary ease.  He was also a unique thinker in science fiction stories, being able to plow new troughs instead of retreading old worn out paths like most pulp novelists of the time were doing.  This is still a fact today and yet amazingly enough, new readers of Dick's stories will find fresh ideas that were written in the 60's.  The movie The Adjustment Bureau is a fine example of an old science fiction tale (The Adjustment Team) by Dick which is novel and intriguing in the 21st Century.  This is probably a main reason his works are now coming to film and TV in abundance (Next, Total Recall, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, Screamers, The Adjustment Bureau, and now on Amazon TV, The Man In The High Castle).  In 1981, Ridley Scott was making a new epic based on a relatively unknown (by public standards in 1981) sci-fi authors story!

So BLADE RUNNER had audience appeal as a spectacle film to the some audience theater goers, but to geeky Sci-Fi fans and not-so-geeky movie fans in general, it developed a near cult status over a period of just a decade following its theatrical release. It was not that successful on initial release because Indiana Jones now looked like a depressed Philip Marlowe and the Film Noir narration was seriously lacking even though the dystopian color affected a Film Noir feeling.  The cinematic style was a huge leap far and above the actual plot and script, so you had a gorgeous film with rather weak main character delivery.  If you are new to Blade Runner you may want to skip the Theatrical Version of the movie right away and save it for later viewing.  The film went through several incarnations thanks to some interesting theaters that began showing ""Road Show"" prints of the film a decade after its initial run, these somewhat rare vault copies energized new interest in the film and what we got resulted in a 1992 ""Directors Cut"" without the tough guy voice over and without the ""happy ending"" (it in fact more closely resembles the original Dick story).  Also included in this set is a 1982 ""International"" version which played mainly in Europe and had extended scenes to the Theatrical version.

The main draw here is 25th Anniversary ""Final Cut"" assembled by Ridley Scott and which is so superior in so many ways to any other version that it makes Blade Runner into a wholly new and absolutely perfect film.  Now Harrison Ford seems to fit better and more interesting than before (or maybe it just is a matter of age and the era in which we live, post-911).

There are featurettes in abundance on the 4th disc (The Enhancement Archive), if you are a Sci-Fi geek somewhere on a par with Sheldon Cooper, this will be your pee-in-your-pants bonus disc, but even if you are not, Dek-A-Rep and the two about the novel and the author are very interesting to watch and highly recommended.

The Final Cut took over 10 years to complete by Ridley Scott and one can see how painstakingly meticulous he paid attention to detail, especially if you have the gumption to watch it back to back against the Theatrical version.

Without spoilers, when watching this film, you will find subtly a treatise on what it means to be human and what it means to have a personal identity, in a rough way it ponders (not nearly as well as) the same questions brought up in Steven Spielberg/Stanley Kubrick's classic AI, Artificial Intelligence.

Blade Runner had to work really hard to become a ""classic"", but when one considers the director and his many masterpieces delivered over the years (still going strong by finishing up the Alien series with finality and about to embark on making Justin Cronin's PASSAGE trilogy into three films), one has to give a big nod to this as a real work of cinematic art and Ridley Scott is truly one of the best directors of modern times.

I purchased this over 7 years ago and have managed to watch everything on the four discs at least once, and the Final Cut about once a year, the other versions at least twice each in that time, so entertainment value versus price is premium!",1494460800,15,4452,4.656887755102041

I love the Four-Disc set and give it 4 stars, would have given it 5 stars if it also had the work print. My recommendation is if you can buy any Five-Disc set (also available on BLU-RAY) for about the same price as the Four-Disc, you should get that instead.

Below is the order I recommend watching all the versions of the film along with the other features in the set. If you only want to watch one version, it's a toss up between the International Theatrical Cut and Final Cut. I recommend watching at least the International Cut and Final Cut along with Dangerous Days.

Disc 3: US Theatrical Cut (1982)

Disc 3: Director's Cut (1992) This version is without the happy ending or narration over the film

Disc 2: Dangerous Days: a 210 minute documentary on the complete making of Blade Runner (and every minute is worth watching)

Disc 5: The Work Print and the Featurette ""All Our Variant Futures"" (Nether included in the Four-Disc set)

Disc 4: Enhancement Archive: Has many features including nearly an hour of deleted scenes

This is one of the best ever sci-fi movies. Very very gothic. The scene where Sebastian and Roy go to ""meet his maker"", there's like a 1000 of these giant candles in this dude bedroom. It's just a very visually stimulating set.

Most of the set is this way. All wet, raining, dark, lots of neon/articifical light. Paints a very bleak future.

Some of the lines are all-time, tho I can't quote any. It's the places they take you, the action.. there's this entire 'world' off of Earth and things are happening, battles and combat.

Rutger Hauer owns this movie, but everyone is really good in this. I don't get caught up in the whole thing of whether or not Harrison was a replicant or not. I'd rather think he is not, since a human falling for a replicant would be a better story line.",1480809600,,794,4.417808219178082

104708,3,0790729628,"I am a bit of a fan of noir-styled films of gritty detective thrillers and/or whodunit films. Needless to say, one of my favorite aspects of the theatrical/original version of ""Blade Runner"" was the narration voice-over by Ford throughout the film. The film was (at the time) 40 years into the future and despite this ""distance,"" that narration gave it a very personal feel. You as the viewer were far more able to relate to Ford's character Deckard's cynicism and general loner personality. It also lent a vintage feel to a futuristic film. The detective's narration in a gritty crime film will always be one of my favorite aspects of such movies.
Specifically, there are certain scenes where you're given insight into Deckard's character and his biting wit, thus enriching the film. In one scene - while Deckard is searching a suspect's residence - the narration provides his reasoning for centering on 2 specific evidentiary finds, his thoughts on them, why he finds them so intriguing and why they become so important as the film advances. Now imagine his thoughts being taken out of the film. I know some may disagree, but I still say it lessens Scott's film overall.
Scott is terribly off by constantly editing this aspect out of the film. I honestly don't care what his reasons are, it still seriously detracts from a great film, which is why I give his ""Final Cut"" 3-stars instead of 5. Is it still a terrific crime drama? Of course, but why Scott wishes to subtract from it is beyond me. Even the added scenes and spoken lines by certain characters doesn't make up for the absence of Deckard's narration.",1477008000,4,1613,4.764285714285714

104715,2,0790729628,"More like Bladewalker, this movie's pace made it unfit for viewing by my impatient teenage self when it first made it to HBO in the early days of cable TV and that opinion holds. The theatrical release was infamous for its dumbed down mansplaining voiceover and tacked on happy ending, so we gave this supposedly definitive 2007 re-edit a go. The voiceover is gone but this movie is still a bore. It reminds me of the terrible '70s show Bigfoot & Wildboy. In that low-budget travesty, much time is devoted to moving the characters from one location to another. Likewise this film asks viewer repeatedly to sit back and enjoy the scenery like a jetlagged tourist in a sky gondola as our jaded hero gets from here to there. Perhaps cutting edge at the time, the set design is less rich than that found in average video games today. Harrison Ford is a lifeless cipher whose idea of acting is looking confused by letting his mouth hang open. The film scores points for atmosphere and the testing scenes are gripping but the action and violence is typical Hollywood. Loses a star due to hackneyed and intrusive Vangelis soundtrack--which in one scene inexplicably drowns out an on-screen piano. Overrated waste of time though Daryl Hannah shines as a wiley fleshbot femme fatale.",1475971200,2,1274,4.769230769230769

The Replicants were super strong but couldn't kill Decker with their bare hands?!  The Replicants were super smart but didn't figure out how to use weapons?  The Blade Runners had to use a special machine and  interrogation to sniff out a Replicant from a human - meanwhile their eyes shimmer with a reflective shine most of the time?  It may be a masterpiece of film making but that must be in purely an academic sense.  The technology in this movie makes it irrelevant fantasy when viewed today.",1467849600,,604,4.6761904761904765
104766,5,0790729628,"This is my favorite version of this Futurist masterpiece. I bought it on DVD because it was the only way I could get it without all the other versions. I loathe the Final Cut version. Redundant scenes, extended explicit and graphic scenes and relevant elements removed...horrible. It is an example of an artist (Ridley Scott) compromising his work for profit. Sean Young herself has stated how embarrassing and distressing the sex scene was involving Rachael and Deckard. Very unnecessary scene, as is the additional violence. A Masterpiece is a Masterpiece, it NEVER needs updated or improved. It is truly a fascinating film and becomes more prophetic with time. The Syd Mead visuals are still influencing everything. The last great Futurist vision before CGI and apathy...",1467763200,,774,5.2

104768,5,0790729628,"I have two beefs with this flick. The first is: if these Replicants are going to die anyway why do they need to be assassinated?? All they'd have to do is provide protection for the key people who made them and wait for the inevitable. Second: they changed the ending! I saw the original film in a drive-in theatre back in 1982! And there was never any thought of Decker possibly being a 'Replicant' himself! He doesn't  _HAVE_  to be a Replicant to have the hots for Rachel! She's hot no matter what!! Other than that I absolutely adore Roy Batty's death scene, which was played by Rutger Hauer. His line, (paraphrase) ""All those moments will be lost in time . . . like tears in the rain."" was just exquisite! This movie is one of my all-time faves.",1467590400,,750,4.388489208633094

104776,5,0790729628,"Without out doubt, the best film, story, directing, acting and concept I have seen out of Hollywood. It has incredible social depth, the issue of artificial intelligence as a sentient being  with emotions like humans have worthy, or not, of respect, rights and a place in society, and the possible future we face as a society.
This set includes fantastic out takes that take us on an in depth, behind the scenes tour of real film magic looks like the passion and genius of great team work. From the smallest detail to the grand view, from the actors perspectives to the etching of miniatures, all covered in smoke and fog, it is an incredible force. The magical collaboration of Ridley Scott, Vangellis, Fancher & Peoples, the acting team and crew, is unsurpassed.

And dark.  Very dark; the sun never appears in what seems to be a nightmare world of impossible high-rises, squalid streets, abandoned buildings and blinding artificial lights that leave the surroundings even darker and more impenetrable. Harrison Ford does well, as does a young Sean Young, but the film to me, belongs to Rutger Hauer as the embittered replicant.",1464912000,3,694,5.178571428571429

The sum of its parts - gritty ambience, deep existential pondering, strange walls of light, Vangelis' brilliantly haunting and deeply effective score, Rick Deckard (Han who...?) and Roy Batty's (whose improvised closing monologue is certainly more human than human) Dark Knight/Joker dynamic - creates a synergy unmatched by any other contender in the sci-fi battle royale.

104876,5,0790729628,"What's in a title?  Quantum physics explains the power of this one.  When Ridley Scott chose to name his filmed adaptation of Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? after an unrelated novel, Alan E. Nourse's The Bladerunner, an ""entanglement"" was created.  Imagine a string connecting the two Blade Runners, transcending the Meaning-Context Perimeters of each work.  (In our diagram, the perimeters deliberately resemble Morse code, because beyond a literary work's context, meanings tend toward the cryptic and secret.)  That entangling string is vibrated or ""enlivened"" by the Meaning-Context Perimeters, very much like the string of a violin activated by a bow.  We see that the resulting resonance is interpenetrating  each work becomes colored by the other.  The significance is quasi-magical, as readers unfamiliar with Nourse's coinage of Bladerunner are yet taken by the word's glamour in Scott's usage (in its original sense, ""glamour"" meant enchantment/magic and was an alteration of the word ""grammar"").  And vice versa, since the entangling string connects beyond time.  Each title is powerful in its respective year (1974 for Nourse, 1982 for Scott) because of that entangling string; in other words, the punch of Nourse's title is in anticipation of Scott's echo of it eight years later, and, paradoxically, Scott banked on the glamour ""previously"" inherent in Nourse's term.  (We of course recall that in terms of quantum physics, time does not exist in the way that we observe and metabolize it.)",1455580800,27,1527,5.347280334728033

I am very disappointed when directors do this.  The director's final  cut is almost always depressing.

104921,4,0790729628,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this science fiction cult classic...

I find Blade Runner (1982) to be a rather unique science fiction movie in that it takes place in Los Angeles in the year 2019.  Harrison Ford starred in this movie in between starring in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return Of The Jedi (1983).  This movie also stars Sean Young as Rachael, the romantic interest of Deckard (Harrison Ford).  Sometimes she looks like and reminds me of Joan Crawford from the early 1940s, mainly because of her wardrobe and shoulder pads and even her hairstyle to some extent (and that cigarette).  Anyway, she gives a good performance, as does Ford.  It also stars Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, and Daryl Hannah.  This movie drags a little at times, but the action more than makes up for it.  I think maybe Christopher Nolan (director of the Batman movies from 2005, 2008, and 2012) was inspired by this movie (could be wrong) when it comes to the flying vehicle, which reminds me of Batman's flying car in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).

While this movie doesn't exactly reflect what life and reality is like in the current day (2010s), it definitely was an ambitious project that is worth seeing.  I think this movie might be an acquired taste for some people.  This review is of the director's cut DVD from 1999.  This movie was directed by Ridley Scott.",1451433600,,1426,4.678714859437751

104940,5,0790729628,"""Blade Runner,"" the film (and different edits of the film) may well be the greatest science fiction film ever. Based on Phillip Dick's ""When Androids Dream Do They Dream of Electric Sheep"" (if a bit off, it was about 35 years ago that I read this), in this film, is brilliantly adapted. As ""urban legend"" has it, Author Dick really liked it. But, I hope you read the written piece, as the film, though at times troubling, does not touch the angst in the written original. For one, it omits the second story line of a new religion, and for another, makes ""Rachel"" even more heart-breaking. . . . I believe I have watched all edits. I like this and the original release best. The original voice-overs by Harrison Ford are ""noir"" at its best. This edit, truer to Mr. Dick's ""Androids,"" is more haunting and revealing, and as such is closer to the original. Seeing, at Amazon Streaming, ""The Man in the High Castle,"" I believe a gifted producer and director will take the challenge and attempt a version closer to the original writing (as ""High Castle,"" so far seems true to the book).

104945,3,0790729628,"Well I realize that the film is almost 34 years old.  I read an appraisal recently from a very reliable, intelligent film reviewer that the Final Cut was scrubbed and cleaned but I saw no evidence of that except in select long shots.  And of course the end titles were new so they looked sharp indeed.  But the rest of the film on Blu-ray, sadly, looked no better than the VHS tape version that I played to death for many years.  I could not sense any improvements in sound either, except for more sharpness in the rain effects.

Was it worth the $13.89 for three Blu-ray discs of a fantastic film?  Yes absolutely and this should be the permanent, long-lasting copy of a great film.  Is it any better than my old VHS tape?  Nope.

In case you are interested, there are no chapter stops.  This was not important to me, but to really study the film I think the director should have provided them.  I am less likely to watch the film knowing there is no chapter menu, even if I don't ordinarily utilize them.  I cant really estimate when the last time I watched this movie was  (17 years sounds about right)  and I won't be in any rush to watch it again, based on this disappointing Blu-ray experience.",1448668800,,1200,4.3710407239819

104986,4,0790729628,"The influence of ""Blade Runner"" on the science fiction films which followed it cannot be over-emphasized.  Its depiction of a crowded, frenetic future Los Angeles, at once high-tech and grimy, managed to straddle the line between surreal and familiar.  The overall look is dark, with poorly-lit interiors, and exterior shots taking place mostly at night and in the rain, but the scenes are full of clearly resolved details that somehow never descend into chaos or meaningless clutter.  Harrison Ford's reluctant cop (basically an assassin) is perfect for him, although not as likeable as his Indiana Jones or even Han Solo characters.  Rutger Hauer is also perfectly cast as the Replicant leader, although this must have been for his appearance and not his acting abilities; Hauer has a resume as long as a giant squid's tentacles, but other than here and a handful of minor roles in ""Buffy,"" ""Batman Begins,"" and a few others, he hadn't been in anything I'd ever heard of.  The two female leads, Daryl Hannah (at one time, ""the most beautiful woman in the world"") and Sean Young (who?) phone in their performances, not much of a loss as their characters are supposed to be androids.  For some reason, male replicants are capable of emotion, but females aren't.  And I'm not sure what purpose the Edward James Olmos character served, other than the admittedly cool detail of leaving small origami sculptures everywhere, and delivering the immortal line ""It's too bad she won't live! But then again, who does?""  Deep, man.

The plot is inconsistent to the point of absurdity.  Androids have been invented and were used for slave labor, until a few of them rebelled, so an elite team of assassins (""Blade Runners"") is dispatched to eliminate them.  The fact that if this happened in real life, it would be a crisis the likes of which humanity has not seen before, and would be handled by the military as every slave revolt in history has been, is inconvenient and apparently not as interesting as the last Blade Runner hunting down the last replicants.  Along the way, we meet an anti-social maker of audio-animatronic robots, a super-rich mad scientist who no one holds accountable for the colossal screw-up of creating rebellious androids, and a skull-crushing sequence that was done far better in the ""Game of Thrones"" episode ""The Mountain and the Viper.""  I saw ""Blade Runner"" when it first came out, and while I remembered the line ""the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long,"" I didn't recall the thumbs-in-the-eyes scene a few moments later, but I'll remember Hafr Jlus Bjrnsson exploding Pedro Pascal's cranium with his bare hands until the day I die.

However, the film's overarching theme of what it means to be human transcends these objections, and the film's set design alone destines it for immortality.",1444608000,,2829,4.940928270042194

105015,2,0790729628,"Blade Runner is widely considered to be the best Science Fiction movie ever made. It is on almost every top 100 list, and that's why I am reviewing it. To tell you why it is one of the most overrated films of all time. Science Fiction is my favorite genre, and the author of Blade Runner, Philip K. Dick is one of my favorite authors, but Blade Runner is far from his best work. I would go as far as saying that Blade Runner isn't even in his top ten, and if it wasn't for Ridley Scott, it wouldn't have been the first film adaptation of Dick's work. At the time, the special effects were innovative and exciting, but they fail to live up to today's standards. With that being said, all that's left over is a simple story that follows a futuristic police chase and a very cheesy, awkward, love story. In a futuristic Los Angeles, android technology has been perfected. These replicants are used for labor an odd jobs, but occasionally, they become aware and try to run for their freedom. That is when the blade runners are called in to eliminate them. The best Blade Runner around is Deckard (Harrison Ford), a man who doesn't love his job, but always gives one hundred and ten percent. After three replicants escape from the moon, Deckard is called in to track them down and this is the whole premise of the movie. There isn't much of a side story and the rare breaks in the action, rarely prove to be substantive. The film is just you're typical chase with some very weird elements. For example, why does Rutger Hauer take off all his cloths before he fights Harrison Ford, and for that matter, what the hell is he talking about the whole time? How about the talking toys, can you tell me they weren't just a bit creepy and out of character for the rest of the film? Finally, we're in Los Angeles, why is everything Chinese? The story is just a very strange chase through a futuristic nightmare scenario for Los Angeles. Yes, Harrison Ford was terrific, and yes, it must of been the hardest thing Ridley Scott ever had to direct, but the film and story itself are very simplistic and certainly not worthy of legendary status. I love Philip K. Dick and I am obsessed with Science Fiction, but watching Blade Runner for the third time, I was still just as bored and confused as I was the other two times I saw it. How can anything that makes a person feel that way be considered legendary?",1443225600,,2389,4.419501133786848

It's just the entire premise and structure of the movie.

Back on the big screen, Blade Runner remains an overwhelming experience, with Doug Trumbulls photographic effects and Larry Paulls production designs melding seamlessly with location shots of downtown LA to create a groundbreaking retro-fitted future.

While that may not have been Ridley Scotts artistic vision I felt like it added something to the movie that the directors cut lacked and that is the essence of the old film noir detective movies from the 30s and 40s. I missed that atmosphere and am glad now that I can enjoy the film in it's originally released form.

Dick (the genius behind Minority Report, The Man in the High Castle, A Scanner Darkly, Paychecks, The Adjustment Bureau, Total Recall, Screamers...), as visualized by well-known film maker, Ridley Scott. It's a dark future in LA, and robots who appear completely human (known as replicants), but are used for slave labor in off-world colonies, tend to rebel, at times. And that's where a ""blade runner"" (a government-sanctioned, robot-killing cop) comes in. Harrison Ford famously portrays ""Rick Deckard"", who is called in (more like forced) when a half-dozen replicants come back to Earth, leaving a trail of dead humans on the way. Why have they returned? In the process of killing them (known as ""retirement""), Deckard will find out more about himself than he bargained, and begin to question many things. There are great depictions of future buildings, very well-played characters, a wonderful soundtrack (by Vangelis), and a haunting movie that you won't soon forget.

The theme of computers, corporations, magic and vampires is later seen in the Matrix triology. This movie, Blade Runner has a detective mystery feel to it since the plot is to find out why criminal genetically modified super-humans have returned to planet Earth where they were being terminated. There is a scene where Sean Young's character is treated roughly which is disturbing and perhaps what she reveals about her profession is mentioned so fast that it could be missed by the viewer. There is one comment where she asks her interviewer (Harrison Ford) a question where she is really just calling him heart-less. It's interesting how Blade is also the name of the avatar William Hunter in the 1990's Sega CD game Rise of the Dragon.

This film is maddening in the sense that it is brilliant in some ways, but very weak in others.  For example, the ultimate arc of the plotline consists of the good guy hunting down a group of bad guys one by one, with a romantic subplot.  This is not new.  Also, Rutger Hauer turns in what I could only call the textbook definition of over-acting.  Literally every word that comes out of his mouth is just way, way overdone.  I can't believe the director never told him to take it easy at least once.  I also felt like the majority of the plotline was extremely predictable.

On the other hand, the visuals of this film are amongst the best ever captured on film.  The set design, the use of color, lighting, and sound to create this ultra-modern world of decay (and near constant rain) is incredibly well done.",1437350400,,1070,4.413265306122449

I chose this four disc version for a more than reasonable price and was absolutely blown away by the Final Cut. The original version on steroids, meticulously restored.  I was particulary moved by the sound quality.  I have Bose speakers and it sounds just beautiful.  For those who don't have blue ray capability, like myself, this is a wonderful choice.  One thing to note:  on disc four there is a special feature discussion on whether Deckard is a replicant with some very intelligent observations on both sides.  I prefer Deckard as human, myself, but it is really a personal choice.  I like this idea because I find the thought of a replicant/human relationship to be very intriguing. This four disc set also provides hours and hours and hours of viewing pleasure!  If Blade Runner isn't the finest film ever made, it is damn close!",1436832000,49,971,4.658823529411765

Harrison Ford plays ""Rick Deckard"", a retired police officer, now 39 . His expertise and skills are needed again.

Disc 2: Blade Runner: Dangerous Days. Behind-the-scenes and Making of Blade Runner. (3 hours, 33 mins)

This version does not include the alternate ending of Deckard and Rachael driving happily down the road in the sunshine.

Please note that in this movie they have big advertising video screens, something we have now, but not to the extent they have in this movie. We did not have those in 1982.
 The use of computers and being able to respond to voice command and digitally enhance and zoom-in a photograph. We could not do that in 1982 and the Apple computers were not available to the public for home-use until 1984.

You will see many interesting things that represent the year 2019 in the future.

Sequel:  Blade Runner 2049 (2017). Harrison Ford, Edward James Olmos return. Sean Young returns by CGI effects.",1433635200,,2638,5.053117782909931
105188,5,0790729628,"When ""Blade Runner"" was released in the Summer of 1982, mainstream audiences were not quite ready for this very different vision of the future. And I will even admit, I was among them at the time. I didn't understand the depth of ""Blade Runner"" until I had had subsequent multiple experiences of it. I don't know if you really see Blade Runner as much as become absorbed into it. Although Blade Runner was a box office disappointment upon its release, it had stiff competition in 1982. Spielberg's ""ET"", the sentimental science fiction film, had broken all box office records; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, was the favorite for pure good guy versus bad guy SF; and other films outside the genre were much more uplifting and linear, such as ""Tootsie"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". (The other under-appreciated masterpiece of that year was ""Sophie's Choice"", although Meryl Streep did deservedly win for Best Actress.)

Despite its mixed critical reception, including a very ambivalent review by Roger Ebert who called it a ""failure as a story"", ""Blade Runner"" has emerged as one the three best films of 1982, the other two being ""Ghandhi"" and ""Sophie's Choice"". My revised list of Best Picture nominees in alphabetical order for 1982: ""Blade Runner"", ""E.T."" ""Ghandhi"", ""Missing"", ""Sophie's Choice"". I would still give top award nods to Ghandhi but only by the slimmest of margins. Blade Runner would be my very close second choice. (""The Verdict"" and ""Tootsie"" are good films but not exactly masterpieces.)

The story concerns relatively new technology: the producing of humanoid cyborgs which have become dangerously close to human life. They are called ""Replicants"". The latest models appear to have feelings and emotions like humans. Now, some renegade Replicants who feel they were treated as slaves on a labor planet have sprung from their ""slavery"" and returned to earth. They wish to confront their creators. Richard ""Rick"" Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a ""blade runner"", a kind of detective/police officer who finds and exterminates renegade Replicants. One of his tools is a series of questions offered a suspected Replicant designed to create responses which tip-off the questioner as to whether or not the participant is human. But then Decker falls for a female Replicant, Rachel (Sean Young) who seems all too human.

In the 1950's and 1960's, a very select group of eclectic readers absorbed and appreciated the work of a somewhat lesser-known science fiction writer, Philip K. Dick. Dick was a maverick of the SF genre, essentially immersing readers into a world much more reminiscent of the works of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett than Gene Roddenbery or George Lucas. Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade could navigate Blade Runner's darkened and misty streets much more effectively than either James T. Kirk or Luke Skywalker. While the most popular writers of the SF genre were still getting into rocket ships and flying to planets for high adventure, Dick was painting on an entirely new canvas, where urban noir meets future technology. Flying taxis and large plasma screens reside along with overpopulation and dirty streets. And he was writing in the 1950's and 1960's! However, even by 1982, audiences were still craving the likes of heroic science fiction such as Star Trek and Star Wars. Typical audience sensibility was still far behind ""Blade Runner"".

What made ""Blade Runner"" tough on audiences at the time of its release and so appreciated today is that it challenges viewers' perceptions of not only the future but the nature of modern reality itself. Unlike Star Wars and Star Trek, ""Blade Runner"" is a cautionary tale, an updated version of ""Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus"" and therefore, everything presented in its world is at the very least disconcerting and at the worst quite horrifying. SF has been predominantly about Utopias. ""Blade Runner"" is a story set in a ""Dystopia"". SF most often distinguishes between right and wrong, good and bad. ""Blade Runner"" is about the blurry shades between ethics and justice, where the ones with which we most empathize are outlaws. SF endings are often neat and tidy. ""Blade Runner"" offers a very ambiguous and contemplative ending (and I am not referring to the final coda of the original theatrical release). ""Blade Runner"" deals with themes concerning the larger questions of life and meaning, very uncommon in SF cinema as a whole. And that's why ""Blade Runner"" has become not only an iconic classic of the SF genre, it is one of the reasons that cinema has continued to be a captivating medium. ""Blade Runner"" is in the same company as ""Ghandhi"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Casablanca"". Know that SF can sometimes transcend its own genre, and BR inspired a new wave of films, such as ""The Matrix"" and ""Dark City"". ""Blade Runner"" was and is one of the finest examples of watershed ground-breaking cinema.",1433462400,,4886,5.0433168316831685

I features the Theatrical Cut, The International Cut, The Directors Cut and the Final Cut. But The Blu ray Set includes the WORK PRINT! I must admit i scoured a few torrent sites to find a copy, but none were seeding so...The work print is the version first previewed March 5, Continental Theater, Denver; March 6, Northpark Theatre, Dallas, 1982. The differences in this version include-Violence of the international cut (Intact), No Voice Overs-minus towards the end in the Dove scene (I'm calling it that to not ruin the ending...Nice huh?), There are other interesting variations that i can't begin to list but a huge difference is in the score. During the Bar scene a Brian Eno/David byrne track QURAN which was deleted from the Ghosts LP (as we'll as subsequent released versions of the film) over being too controversial.  I cant say if the controversy over it's release had to do with excising it from the film but i can say it works really well during that scene, Fits right in with the Vangelis compositions.

105215,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner (1982) is the type of movie in which you really wonder what genre it belongs to. There's action, suspense, horror, sci-fi, drama, neo-noir, etc. The neo-noir is futuristic, and arguably is its genre. Then again, there's a lot of sci-fi that dominates a lot of scenes. I guess we can say that Blade Runner is a little bit of everything. Romantic music playing in intimate scenes? Of course, but this is the run-of-the-mill, typical music that we hear in dramas. Now, for the Harrison Ford casting: was he cast for this movie simply to boost ticket sales? He seems oddly out of place in this movie, and seems to just be going through the motions. His performance was nothing to brag about. This movie suffers from an identity crisis, yet that's probably what makes it appealing to the masses. Blade Runner is like one of those songs that doesn't fit a certain genre, or one that never finds its groove and momentum. Again, even more reason to like it? I think that Ridley Scott did a superb job depicting a dark and dreary world where danger lurks nearby, while giving a nice dose of tech eye candy here and there. Blade Runner is an acquired taste; perhaps I might add a star to this review at a later date. For right now, it's a good to very good action/sci-fi/drama/horror/thriller of a movie. Update (7-14-15): I now give Blade Runner five stars, and Harrison Ford's acting and place in this movie is starting to resonate. I guess that this movie needs repeated viewings until it grows on a person. If you stay with it, it'll reward you. Slow a lot of the time, it's still powerful in aesthetic, music, and plot. The characters portrayed by Rutger Hauer and Darryl Hannah are believable, and add flair to the plot, as their characters depict passion and  have a sense of mission and outcome. Update (2-10-16): I have since purchased the blu-ray that contains 4 versions of the movie, including The Final Cut. All I can say is WOW!!!! If you were impressed with The Director's Cut on regular DVD, then you will be blown away by the blu-ray. This has to be one of the best transfers ever, as the picture and sound are of the utmost pristine quality. It looks and even feels like a brand new experience. If you were ambivalent about Blade Runner in the past, you may want to purchase the blu-ray, and perhaps see it in a different light. The blu-ray release is so powerful and effective in depicting the strange world that is Blade Runner. Am I done? No way! The blu ray set includes three versions of this masterpiece (Original Cut, International Cut, and the Final cut), as well as extensive special features that'll keep you entertained for a long time. If you're looking for an all-encompassing blu ray experience that's a can't-miss, then the Blade Runner blu ray is the one. I praise director Ridley Scott for taking the time to perfect this film, while keeping an open mind along the way. I highly recommend this blu ray version of one of the most important films ever made.",1431302400,,2993,4.594392523364486

Visually the film is very interesting and ahead of its time I guess based on the idea of the flying cars and the travel to another world out of earth and the use of robots, and the creation of a whole nother Earth. I have to give the movie props because anyone who can create an entire world, like we have seen with Avatar and all those Battlestar Galactica movies, deserves all the praise they can be given. I guess I just don't understand why it's such a gloomy place and that drove me insane. Yes, the neo- noir or film noir aspect of it clicks in and the camera angles and the shadows play a part but it was distracting and honestly, it made me reject that aspect of the movie. That being said, the characters in the movie were not my favorite either. I couldn't find a connection with them, neither the replicants nor the humans.  I think the movie tried to hard to make the audience feel something and leave the movie with some sort of thought of wisdom about humanity and how long we have to live and how much the replicants were like humans or even more human than the humans and to some point it succeeded cause here we are discussing it but towards the end it became ridiculous like that fight scene between Roy and Deckard. I guess what confused me the most was the ""love"" story between Rachel and Deckard. Again, here is Deckard killing all the replicants, who were in their turn killing because they wanted to feel human, but suddenly he gets to Rachel and not only is she a replicant but she is a replicant with an unspecified time to live so that they are able to escape this disaster of a world they live in and fly out to the mountains where nothing has been touched or changed. In conclusion, I can appreciate the creation of the visual world and style and transportation to another time aspect of the movie. What I do not appreciate is a sentiment of the world has gone to hell and every body is shooting at each other in the middle of the street for an hour and forty minutes and then all of a sudden the guy gets the girl and they live happily ever after in what seems to be a pre- blade runner world. It seems like two movies to me. Plus the romance between Rachel and Deckard was more forced by Deckard than by Rachel's choice. The girl only wanted to know whether she was human or replicant, Deckard, not run away with you.",1430179200,,2414,4.2592592592592595

The extras are an amazing insight into how the film was restored and how some of the glaring problems were fixed (the scene where Zora is 'retired' and it is obviosuly a stunt woman, the horrible ADR inside the reptile seller's shop and the releasing of the dove at the end).  Otherwise the film was cleaned up and brightened to reveal all of the details in the amazing world Scott and his team created.  For those of us that grew up watching this on VHS it is nothing short of a revelation to see this gorgeous version.

105245,5,0790729628,"This version of the film is from the Ultimate Collectors Edition, which I purchased from Amazon and don't think is any longer available.

Each version of Bladerunner has its particular qualities and adherents and the debates have gone on for years. For me, this version is the best, embodying Ridley Scotts final vision for his film.

Bladerunner is a landmark in cinema, not merely in science-fiction film. The depth and richness mean you can watch it over and over, relish the many articles and studies that have been produced and participate in online discussions. An entire culture has grown up around a film that suffered from studio butchery and cowardice and then from critical negligence, to become an acknowledged masterpiece. The film has entered modern consciousness and continues to garner fans and students.

Aesthetically, philosophically, viscerally, Bladerunner rewards repeated viewings. If you must have one copy, this is it; but do yourself a favour and purchase them all.",1429401600,,991,5.2594936708860756

I prefer the Director's Cut and highly recommend it to first-time viewers because I think it is superior to the many other versions of this movie that exist, but that said, all versions are great. I love everything about this movie.

Here are some reasons why this is my favorite movie ever:
--The soundtrack and visuals are beautiful and together create a breathtaking atmosphere.
--The acting is great, and so are the characters.
--The plot and story are fascinating.
--This is a movie that makes one think. Brings up many philosophical questions, such as ""What does it mean to be human?""
--There are so many powerful, emotional moments in this movie that I find really meaningful.

Rather, this weak and lame, ""Ray Bradburry Wanna Be"" cautionary tale of the rapidly approaching future is a visually driven, overinflated and hyperbolic result of what happens when Ridley Scott is given a lot of money to play with. The characters are one-dimensional, cardboard cut-outs....with cinematic emotions running the gamete from A to B. Scott went so nutso- crazy with visuals- he forgot the fine art of character development. And so I yawned....neither mesmerized nor entranced. I was bored. Completely, totally bored. I just didn't give a damn.....about any character or their ultimate fate(s). A plate of vanilla sugar cookies holds more interest. Perhaps I'm a tad jaded. Perhaps because I'm a Broadcast Producer and zeroed in on the Special Effects within seconds, I saw that Scott was planning a visual ""Holy Grail"" to Blue Screen, Miniatures, early CJE, ADO upon ADO and the obligatory ""Wetted Down"" Set(s).....replete with the oh so predictable menacing combination of smoke, fog, darkness and piercing neon.

Philip K. Dick's original short story and novel were as terrific as most of his work (I started reading science fiction around age 10 and he became one of my favorite authors over the years). I think the essence of the themes this movie addresses are actually more fully realized in the film, a rare thing indeed. (Yes, many of the novel's themes are not present, the film chooses to focus on a few specific ones, instead, but that's fine with me.) It's a movie that has never left me since my first viewing and I have watched it so many times since and thought about it often over the years. A true treat and a great work of art. Enjoy it, as it is an exceptional experience.

""I've never paid quite so much attention to a movie, ever. But we had to create a world that supported the story's premise, made it believable. Why do you watch a film seven times? Because somebody's done it right and transported you to its world."" -- Ridley Scott

-----
[Note: Rutger Hauer was an inspired choice, in my opinion, for the part of Roy, who's much different than Dick's original character and the thing that turns this movie into something special along with the incredible world so fully realized in the film thanks to the entire crew and the many other fine performances by all involved.

105344,4,0790729628,"Disc 2, Dangerous Days, Making Blade Runner. Documentary of the making of Blade Runner, very specific and varied commentary with detail, worth a Toblerone Bar. (When I wrote this, I never thought anyone would find it helpful >V<, guess I might have a chance as a Hollywood Madame smile -).

DISC 1 3 commentaries. 1) Ridley Scott, a commentary I abandoned as Mr. Scott continually excused and justified his actions in the making of the film. Although, I had read about problems on the set, until hearing this I could not imagine how bad they must have been. Apparently, all of his actions should be unquestionable, because he was the one being paid. Like Speilberg and other directors who knew what they were doing, the fact that he was the one paid to do the job justified any of his actions. That statement could use some finessing. I've turned down ""payment"" and jobs in the past made to me because of how I can creatively manipulate appearances, much like a director. Had I taken them I would have been the town whore, somewhat like Mister Scott.

Superman never made any money For saving the world from Solomon Grundy And sometimes I despair the world will never see Another man like him. Lyrics, Crash Test Dummies (1991)

Not that I'm writing in support of Speilberg, because he has become the town whore as of late, but at very least he motivated much stronger storytelling with fewer resources in his first efforts.

2) The writer's commentary, snore. I would revisit this some other time.

3) The real reason for filmmakers to rent or buy this DVD: Commentary by Visual Futurist Syd Mead, Production Designer Lawrence G. Paull, Art Director David Snyder and Special Photographic Effects Supervisors Douglas Trumbull, Richard Yuricich and David Dryer. As a film done with in camera effects this group of people offer invaluable information. Small details with comments on how and why certain in camera effects were used. There is also an attitude of mutual respect amongst this group of artists (that is certainly nothing I've ever heard amongst cameramen, where backstabbing is common).",1426377600,2,2096,4.876404494382022

It luxurious compared to it's contemporaries and most importantly, it gets better with age. 30 years on and Blade Runner stands the test of time, continuing to influence all forms of media from comics, to games, to still more movies. What Blade Runner excels at it it's ability to create a fully realized world that is familiar and exotic at the same time. What guides the harsh newness of the futuristic setting is humanity's ability to adapt and change with it- this is manifested in the main character, Deckard. Expertly played by Ford, he is our connection to this new world we are thrown into. He's the human we know, uneasy with replicants, and a strong sense of self. Mostly. You see, both of these elements are established in the film at various points, but by the end of the film, they both come tumbling down. We end up understanding why replicants are the way they are, and we see Deckard in a much different light. In this way, we've proven our very human ability to adapt again and again.",1424217600,,1036,4.575268817204301

105420,5,0790729628,"Wow this movie is a weird one, but also very entertaining if you are a fan of the sci fi action adventure genre.

 The movie is based on the book, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by sci fi author Philip K. Dick.  The story explores what does it mean to be human.

 I am a big fan of actor Harrison Ford, and love the work he has done over the many years including ""Star Wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Air Force One"", & ""Patriot Games"".  All great movies.  Actor Rutger Hauer is also fantastic too.

 Basic plot, veteran cynical detective Decker ""Harrison Ford"" is charged with hunting down fugitive androids who have rebelled against their programing, and escaped to Earth on their own.  His orders are to find the fugitive androids, and kill them in what he calls putting them in retirement.  The androids are exactly like humans, but much physically stronger and they only have a life span of around 4 years.

 A powerful fugitive model android in the form of actor Rutger Hauer, wants to live longer and has gone on a mission to track down his creators, as Ford pursues him running into and fighting other bizarre androids along the way.

The special effects in this movie are very spectacular for its time, and the tone and music play out like a digital slow playing jazz album.  The artistic imagery, and set scenes are both awe inspiring and also in some cases very gritty and dim.

 The first time I had seen this I was like five or six years old and remembered some scenes vividly like the flying cars, the pyramid headquarters, the Japanese Gesha images, the exotic owl, and this weird dancing lady with the android snake; then after re-watching the film many years later I had the feeling of watching a 1940's Detective film noir drama with some romance thrown in between Sean Young and Ford.

 If you like sci fi fantasy where you are taken to another weird and exotic alien world with in our own, then this movie should entertain.

 Very good movie with amazing visuals, but also very artistic and alien like.",1424131200,2,2022,4.561111111111111

105458,1,0790729628,"Usually a director's cut is superior to the theatrical release of a film; the artist's true vision of what they wanted to say vs. what the studio told them to say to sell theatre tickets.

Sadly, this is NOT the case here. This is one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made and stands the test of time...it doesn't look or feel dated even in the year 2015.

... but without Harrison Ford's gritty narration - a burnt-out, strung-out ""cop"" (a legal assasin in all reality), tortured by what he does, and who he is - feeding you his sometimes insightful, sometimes bitterly callous, but always tinged with emptiness inner thoughts and inner dialogue...this movie comes up short.

Some would argue the narration ""dumbs down"" the movie for those too unimaginative to figure it out; however it adds a gripping, foreboding tension to the film and the ending, with the narration, is truly a spiritual moment, an epiphany for Ford's chracter.

Without the narration it leaves the movie, the moral tale of the folly of Man playing God, and the greater lesson learned by Ford's character from Rutger Hauer's chracter after Hauer spares Ford's life in the end (that ALL life is precious, even an enemy's)is lost completely, or at least in question and up to any and all personal interpretation.",1422921600,6,1283,4.791855203619909

Visually the film was slightly out of focus and domewhat lacking in contrast.  The most objectionable aspect, however, was the audio.  It was necessary to turn the volune on both my computer AND my hd TV up to 100% to get a minimally acceptable level.  This has been the case with the three films I've rented and the two I've purchased -- a problem I have not had with ANY of the films I've rented from the Google Play Store.",1420416000,,603,4.300884955752212
105485,4,0790729628,"Streamed from from Prime, this version has by far the best video I've seen in several other versions of this movie, an all-time classic set in a steamy, always-raining future Los Angeles of the now-not-so far off future of 2019. This version, however, is missing the last, final scene which appears in other versions I have seen, and without it, in my opinion, the ending seems anti-climatic and unfinished: I want that ending back, so I'll keep watching the version I have on DVD even though the video is not nearly so good.

I love the film. and it fits one commentator's statement that it is a ""A haunting, eerily prophetic mixture of science fiction and film noir."" Set in a dystopian LA occupied mostly by Asians and over run with thieves, many of them very strange, the reality is now pretty close to the movie, watering down the effect the film used to have that it represented the future.

Still, it is a classic, and I watch it again and again if only to see Rutger Hauer's soliloquy at the end. Those lines have become a part of my spirituality, for lack of a better word: we are here, as are the androids of the film, to see things you will never see; and in my version, to carry those visions to the next world for those who have forgotten this one.

Naturally, there is a love story, a good one, and that, too, raises some interesting questions. As does the entire film.

Four stars because of (1) the missing ending, and (2) the movie is getting somewhat dated now (please, over-dub the off-screen lines telling us the setting is 2019, so I can continue to suspend disbelief while watching the movie!)

Unfortunately, this film is a slow moving attempt to recreate an classic film noir atmosphere and never quite reaches orbit.  The tech doesn't look too clunky and the special effects are few enough that it hasn't become a joke like some 80s futuristic films.  The problem is that it is way too ponderous with long stretches of Harrison Ford narrating or driving along thinking.  Most of the action scenes are him getting his brains beat in by the ""Skin Jobs"" and escaping death out of sheer luck, which might be what gives this film the little bit of endearing charm that it has.

scrap the 2007 5 Disc blu-ray set

and buy this all new 3 Disc blu-ray release by Warner bros to celebrate the 30th Anniversary of the film
the picture and audio quality for all 5 versions looks amazing in High Definition widescreen
better than the old dvd versions
the sound quality for all 4 versions have been given a Boost aswell
the Final cut blu-ray version has a new 5.1 master Audio mix + 5.1 Dolby Digital + 5.1 TrueHD
the other 3 versions on Blu-ray Disc 2 only has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound & 5.1 TrueHD sound mix
not 5.1 master audio sound mix which i think would have sounded better than the 5.1 Dolby Digital sound
the workprint version on Disc 3 has been given a new Master audio 5.1 mix

there are 2 blu-ray releases of this 30th Anniversary edition
there's the new Blu-ray book which has pages of Photos from the film
or the 4 Disc standard blu-ray case packaging
which has 3 Blu-ray Discs and the 4th Disc being FINAL CUT DVD version
the blu-ray book you can buy freely on amazon.com
the standard blu-ray case packaging with the Disc trays inside
is only available to buy from the Collector's edition box set
i wanted the blu-ray case version, not the blu-ray book version
so i was very lucky to find a seller on ebay that was just selling the blu-ray case on it's own
for only $30 so it was a bargain buy for me

the 3 Disc blu-ray release has all the material from the 5 Disc blu-ray's compressed onto 3 Discs
which i think is incredible
Disc 1 has the Final cut version of the film with all the Audio commentaries
Disc 2 has the 1982 Theatrical cut, the Int' theatrical cut & the 1992 Directors cut
Disc 3 has the Workprint version plus the 2-3hour long Dangerous Days Documentary
plus the ACCESS option on the special features on Disc 3
which has all the Deleted scenes, Alternate scenes, about 45mins of it in brand new HD transfers
plus another 30mins of screen tests with new interviews with few of the Actresses that did screen test for the film
but did not get the role for Rachel or the other 2 replicants
there's also a tribute featurette to the first Cinematographer for the film
plus other featurettes aswell that wasn't on the 4 Disc dvd release years ago

you can spend all day all night watching all the special features but still not finish watching it all.
if you want the standard blu-ray case with the Disc trays instead of the blu-ray book packaging
you'll have to try buy it off ebay you might get lucky and find some sellers
selling just the Blu-ray Disc set and not the complete boxset

Definitely time to upgrade and get this new 3 Disc blu-ray book packaging or blu-ray case

105529,5,0790729628,"For this review I chose to review the original theatrical cut of the classic film Blade Runner (1982).  Blade Runner stars Harrison Ford and is directed by the great Ridley Scott.  Blade Runner was Scott's third time directing a major motion picture. Despite being comparatively inexperienced, Blade Runner is one of Scott's finest films.

Blade Runner is decades ahead of its time.  Blade Runner showed several technologies that are in existence, or being developed today.  For instance in one scene a huge window transitions to a dark tint on command.  This is actually a technology that Corning is developing now.  Blade Runner showcased a payphone with two-way video technology.  While payphones are on their way out, two-way video technology comes standard on nearly every smart phone in the form of Skype.  In the film there are synthetic humans and animals created at the biological level.  Today scientists are growing tissue and organs in labs.

Overall the acting in the movie is surprisingly good for an 80's action movie.  There were a few moments where the acting was not very credible, especially one scene in which Ford's character is surprised by one of the antagonists named Leon. Ford's expression of shock and fear was so over the top it was comical.  The best acting performance in the film was given by Rutger Hauer who plays the leader of the group of replicants that Ford is hunting.  There is much of the typical 80's sinister villain in Hauer's character, but he played the part well.

The film is visually striking; the cinematography is amazing for the time.  The use of lighting and smoke to give the future a bleak appearance devoid of nature was quite impressive.  The special effects were great for a film made before personal computers were readily available.  Flying cars, massive buildings, environmental effects, etc.  I enjoyed the film greatly and look forward to watching Scott's 2007 re-cut of the film.  I give Blade Runner 5 / 5.

All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in the rain..."" This 1982 production was Ridley Scott's first film (this third overall) after his breakout film, ""Alien"" in 1979. Taking a break from his Han Solo and Indiana Jones roles, Harrison Ford is perfect as the Blade Runner, Rick Deckard; and Rutger Hauer costars as the chief Replicant...it was his favorite role and probably his best. The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in 2019 in which genetically engineered Replicants (visually indistinguishable from adult humans), are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation. Their use on Earth is banned and Replicants are exclusively used for dangerous, menial, or leisure work on off-world colonies. Six Replicants have defied the ban and returned to Earth in an attempt to extend their short life spans. They are hunted down and ""retired"" by special police operatives known as Blade Runners. The plot focuses on the escaped replicants led by Roy Batty (Hauer) and the burnt-out expert Blade Runner, Rick Deckard (Ford) who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down. This is a sci/fi actioner, with awesome special effects (especially for 1982) but on many levels it is indebted to film noir conventions...the femme fatale, rainy atmospherics, dark and shadowy cinematography; and the questionable moral outlook of the hero. Speaking of special effects, my favorite is the ""Spinner"", the term for the flying cars used in the film, primarily by law enforcement personnel...they can be used as a ground based vehicle or a flying VTOL vehicle. In addition to Ford and Hauer, look for Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, and Daryl Hannah in key support roles.

105564,3,0790729628,"I finally got around to examine the 3-disc 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition, and I'm relieved that the original theatrical version(s) are available in pristine and IMHO superior quality than the ""Final Cut"".

Although only the ""Final Cut"" fixed a few production goofs by means of CGI (I never found these too bothersome) and reveals slightly better miniature photography, shadow detail is partially reduced compared to the theatrical version (e.g. Bryant's police office) and in general I found the theatrical version's original cinematography more pleasant to watch.

One of the strong suits of the film had always been how it creates ""atmosphere"" by means of photography, music and sound design. One of such highlights is the morning flight to the Tyrell-Corporation pyramid, but in the ""Final Cut"" Vangelis' beautiful score is compromised because of redundant air traffic chatter.

But this is just a somewhat logical continuation of atmosphere deconstruction, because the biggest offender - for multiple reasons - is this awful and pointless unicorn sequence Ridley Scott felt compelled in 1992 to squeeze into the film.

Supposedly, it was then to convey the impression that Gaff's unicorn Origami hinted that he knew of Deckard's dreams and one logical conclusion would have been that Deckard is a replicant, too (but doesn't explain why he doesn't have the replicants' superstrength).

One of the documentaries focuses on this particular issue and it almost seems that every VIP in Hollywood throws in his or her 0.02 $, but no one ever seems to wonder what Gaff's other origamis were supposed to hint (that Deckard rather wanted to be a chicken farmer than a cop? that he was actually gay and empty Hotel rooms gave him funny ideas?).

Always seemed to me that Gaff was making subtle symbolic and clever statements, that he considered Deckard to be a coward (chicken) or that searching other people's belongings had an exciting nature (Peeping Tom). With the unicorn being a symbol of the quest for bliss and happiness, I always felt Gaff merely understood and sympathized with Deckard's needs, adding a facet to the Gaff character that has been somewhat lost ever since 1992.

The VIPs seemed equally oblivious to Gaff's line ""Too bad, she (Rachel) won't live!"" Assuming Deckard was a replicant with a short life-span himself, Gaff's statement would be absolutely point- and worthless.

Now hope is a good thing and a good thing never dies, and after winding in agony listening to all this Deckard=replicant nonsense the familiar face of my favorite living filmmaker appeared on the screen and said what everybody else had obviously missed thus far: It's about a man rediscovering his humanity, if Deckard were a replicant the film wouldn't really make a lot of sense (Thank you, Frank Darabont!).

And last but not least, Harrison Ford popped up and revealed mild astonishment, making it abundantly clear that he played the character as a genuine human being, unaware of any ambiguous aspects.

Ain't that remarkable that Harrison Ford's characters are involved in what may just be as well the two dumbest revisions in film history?!?

To cut a long lamentation short: Watch the original theatrical versions first (and check out the workprint version and the deleted / alternate scenes, too), these are the original context and reason for BLADE RUNNER's ongoing appeal.",1415145600,13,3383,5.143897996357013

I only wanted to watch this movie since the soundtrack was by my favorite new age artist, but when the movie came to an end I was speechless and immediately watched it again.
Since I lived in post revolution Iran the movie was a copy on a VHS tape which was probably rented more than 100 times before I did so the quality was very poor.
Since my migration to the western world, I have purchased every single version of this from VHS to DVD and then Blu-ray and now I even own the digital version too.
The only thing I would say about this masterpiece by Philip K Dick is that it would not have been the same without the haunting soundtrack by Vangelis.  Especially the Love Theme which begins with Rachel playing piano and then it leads into the music.
If you are into science fiction and you like Ridley Scott then this is a must have.

105617,3,0790729628,"Moody, evocative, and influential, ""Blade Runner"" is considered to be one of the truly epochal films in the science fiction genre. A distressed, retro-future late modern aesthetic contrasts both aesthetically and philosophically with the kind of clean, sterile classic modernism found in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" If ""Star Wars"" inhabits a worn universe then ""Blade Runner"" occupies a broken down universe.

""Blade Runner"" attempts to be a kind of neo-noir film, filled with many of the tropes of that genre: the world-weary detective, the femme fatale, the dark, seedy underside of society as a backdrop, etc. The engine that makes noir films go is a combination of plot twists and chemistry between the detective and the femme fatale. Unfortunately, ""Blade Runner"" falls short in both categories. The story is thin, stretched over the film's run time, and far too linear. ""Blade Runner"" has been lauded for being philosophical and enigmatic, but this must surely be due to projection by fans and critics. The lack of story makes the film inscrutable.

Likewise, Harrison Ford and Sean Young don't have a great deal of chemistry, primarily because Ford seems to be sleep walking through the role. Perhaps this was a deliberate choice on his part, but what is presumably supposed to be read as world-weariness on the part of the character, Deckard, looks instead like reluctance on the part of the actor, Ford, to inhabit the movie.

The movie's influence on subsequent generations of filmmakers and their films cannot be denied. However, as a film ""Blade Runner"" is more style than substance.

This review covers ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"" (although I suspect that there will never be a true final cut of this movie--Ridley Scott cannot seem to keep from tinkering with it). Wikipedia has a good overview of the differences between the seven (!) different versions of Blade Runner released as of now.

105636,1,0790729628,"One of the few people posting on this sight who went to the premiere in Hollywood, I found ""Blade Runner"" to be one of Ridley Scotts finest movies and was puzzled over his objections about final cut. So I never watched the DVD version because the rare 70mm print we saw at the premiere impressed me so much that nothing could ever take its place in my mind. Granted, this version of the future now seems silly. But back then, I fell in love with Scott's version of the Phillip K. Dick story ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" Both Scott and Dick posed a good question at the time - if we grow specialized ""people"" to do our bidding, should we consider them fully human? Since androids will never come to pass (as envisioned at least) and LA will never be a city in perpetual darkness under a din of oil companies run amok and giant pyramids with flying police cars, I believe it's safe assume the answer is redundant. Still, I love the performances and the ambience and the score of the original film. The director's cut? Not so much, especially the ending. Walk into the elevator and that's it? No, sorry, Ridley. Poor ending. Bad change to a good film that should standing on its own merits. The new cuts aren't worth your time or ours.",1411603200,2,1242,4.427947598253275

105652,3,0790729628,"Maybe I need to watch it again, but based off 1 viewing, I was let down with Blade Runner. From a filmmaking standpoint, it's gorgeous, undisputably beautiful. I was impressed and shocked that this was released in the early 80s. The acting, especially by the grad replicant was especially excellent. Also the premise and world the movie takes palce in is really interesting, but the choice to focus on 4 escaped replicants wanting to meet their creator felt underwhleming. The action was OK, but slow motion was overused and some of the fight scenes were just awkward and looked goofy (specifically the acrobatic replicant fight). What really soured me on this me though was the rape scene. Even though nothing was actually shown, the scene was basically the precursor to rape. What made that scene even more egregious was the end. All in all, this is a pretty movie that had the potential to tell a much more interesting story. I've heard that this is a sci-fi classic, but I was let down. Watch Ridley Scott's Alien instead.",1411344000,,1026,4.769662921348314

105654,4,0790729628,"Why did they think it was better to leave out the final scene on the rail train. The over-arching principle behind the final narrative was to give us a feeling of continuity and to understand what he was thinking inside about Rachael. Because of cutting this and several other ""narrative scenes"" Blade Runner loses its ""realism"" and becomes another ""artistic"" campy variation of directing.

IF you want to really watch a good version of Blade Runner for you ""x"" generation, please get ahold of an older version of the DVD. The final scene at the train, makes it all worthwhile.",1411257600,,577,4.77

105669,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner is a sci-fi masterpiece.  It has almost everything in a good sci-fi flick; breathtaking effects, a deep and philosophical story, good characters, amazing atmosphere, and a good cast.  Harrison Ford brings his A-game with this one.  This is probably one of my favorite performances of his.  In my opinion this is Ridley Scotts 2nd best film behind Gladiator.  However, regardless of how good it is, this is not a film I would watch all the time.  Admittedly, when I first saw this movie I hated it.  I gave the film another chance though and I grew to love it.  The reason I didn't like it at first was because I wasn't in the right mindset for it.  I was expecting a film like Star Wars which this is definitely not.  You really have to be in the right mindset to view this.  Blade Runner is not the movie you just pop in for a casual viewing to kill time or if you want to have a fun time.  Its dark, atmospheric, philosophical, and has a downbeat tone throughout.  This is most likely why Blade Runner didn't do well in the theatre.  This film came out the same year as E.T.  Everyone wanted fun sci-fi which this film clearly isnt.  Fortunately, over the years, it has become a cult classic which it deserves to be.

The film takes place in Las Angeles in the dystopian future of 2019.  We follow a retired cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is called back to the force temporarily.  Several human-like androids called replicants have gone rogue and it is Deckards job to bring them down.

As I said, the film looks brilliant.  I think the special effects are on-par with the Star Wars trilogy.  Yes, its not the most colorful looking film or very fun to look at, but thats the point.  The film is going for a very realistic dystopian future with overpopulation, pollution, and very cultural.  The acting is great particularly from Ford.  The only characters worth mentioning are Deckard or the main replicants, Batty (Rutger Hauer).  The story is told from their different prospectives.  From following both of them we see both of their views on what it means to be human which is one of the main themes of the movie.

There are things that can be seen as flaws with the film.  When I first saw the movie there were many things I didn't like about it until I tied to see things differently.  Firstly the film moves at a fairly slow pace or, at least, it felt that way.  This is a trait you see in most Ridley Scott films.  The atmosphere and overall feel of the film is a little too good if that makes sense.  If you are the slightest bit sleepy this film can easily put you to sleep.  I just about fell asleep on my first viewing.  Id watch the directors cut or the final cut of the film if possible.  In the theatrical cut you have Harrison Ford give narrations throughout the movie and it just made the film even more of a snore fest.  The film is trying to build atmosphere and enthrall you into the world its created, but some people will probably have issue with it.  Its not bad but I do think people will think the film is too padded-out.

Another thing is the action scenes.  The action in this film is not like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.  Deckard is actually not a very good fighter.  He gets his ass handed to him quite frequently by the replicants.  This did really bother me on first viewing.  However, I don't feel that way now.  I think that the way they did the actions scenes made them feel more real.  Besides, if they were to have Star Wars or Indiana Jones type action in this then it would conflict with the tone of the rest of the film.

Overall, Blade Runner is a classic movie that should be seen at least once.  Just go in with the mindset that this is not like Star Wars, E.T., War of The Worlds, or any of those sci-fi films and youll be fine.  Its sad that it didn't get much recognition when it was first released, but at least it is getting the treatment it deserves now.",1410739200,,3927,4.3356258596973865

Several people had even told me it was their favorite movie.  What did I miss?  Maybe it just doesn't stand the test of time.  I was not impressed at all.  Maybe I missed something.  I did find it funny how it projected life in 2019.  People still smoking cigarettes left and right, video phone calls from a public pay telephone ($1.25 charge) and I guess there is no more sun in 2019...

105681,5,0790729628,"... but if you are looking for a compelling and thought provoking story on so many levels, this is the film for you.  Replicants - manufactured humans who are little more than slaves, designed with limited life spans of a few years and implanted memories.  When a few of them go on an exceedingly violent rampage seeking to extend their lives, a Blade Runner, essentially a bounty hunter, is sent to exterminate them.  That's the story in a nutshell but this film is far more than that.

What becomes of my memories, feelings, and accomplishments when I die?  Will my life really matter when I'm gone and how?  How long do I have to live and why am I so powerless to change the inevitable?  This film will have you asking such questions with what is one of the most moving soliloquies of any film ever made.

There is no happy ending for this film, at least not in the conventional sense.  But you'll have a lot to think about after you've seen it and it might leave you feeling a bit uncomfortable.  Add this one to your movie bucket list.",1410566400,,1040,4.397905759162303

Just a few voiceovers (probably passages from the book) read by Harrison Ford in the most bored tone. All that's left is a few fights without much to link them.

Combining the grizzled narration that painted the worlds of Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe with a vision of the future that still holds up thirty years later with few exceptions, it is both a riveting action adventure and an existential inquiry into the question of just what is life, and what gives it meaning or value.

With the perspective of time, it's clear that the magic derives mostly from the visionary setting and the otherness of the replicants, especially Hauer. It's hard to imagine the movie without him. The hackneyed policeman-coming-out-of-retirement is the weakest part of the film, and Ford is the short straw acting-wise. But the twist really works, Hauer really is the center of good at the end, and that launches the viewer into a special place.

Now that I know a bit more about Dick's amphetamine habit, it's easy to understand his sympathy for the replicants. His fictional androids lived for four years, but they burned brighter than any human. Dick died of a stroke at 54 after a life on speed.",1408924800,,749,4.897637795275591

From the point of view of Sci-Fi cloning, genetic manipulation, artificial living humans and animals with over developed features, flying automobiles, fast and powerful image processing machines, etc. Over society concepts we have greenhouse effects, over population, space colonies, human culture and languages merged in syncretic global culture. The movie states that Japanese, Germanic, English and Spanish will conform a popular common used new language. We saw what is happing in USA in which many food chains have menus in English and Spanish, most of the appliances and electronic devices now are coming with manuals and even in the box showing instructions in three different languages. I think that is the future. Races and Languages fused in a new global common culture amalgamating many people. Apart, the style of photography and the visual concept behind the movie The Music by Vangelis is a big plus.

105857,5,0790729628,"A classic yet still fresh, despite the already-hilarious 2019 card.  The noirish detective mystery in a sci-fi world is just a thin cover for its themes of mortality, humanity, morality, and the search for, or struggle against, place and purpose.  This was the Final Cut version - Harrison Ford's obviously-bored voiceover is removed and there is no resolution at the end.  Both factors means the story and the main character are far more ambiguous, which made the movie a better story for me.  The movie remains ahead of its time.  I watched this streaming thanks to Prime but the color, clarity, and sound appeared top-notch which was much appreciated for a movie set in generally dark, rainy surroundings.  Blade Runner:  The Final Cut is the rare example of a film where the director didn't insert 'upgrades' to show off but which are ultimately pointless or detrimental to the story.",1407888000,,888,4.919463087248322

105878,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner is one of the best movies of the past century.  It outdoes any science fiction movie I've seen before or since, even though special effects may now be more sophisticated.  The setting and special effects create an Apocalyptic Earth that is believable.  This is a dark movie, of course, in tone and appearance, as it was meant to be--and can offer only a small amount of hope, both for human nature and what the future of humankind holds. It was easy for me to suspend disbelief throughout.  What I like most is that the movie is not about good humans and bad genetically-engineered people.  It reveals the deep flaws in the human characters--primarily their hardness and lack of compassion; but, more importantly, at moments, it reveals a ""common humanity"" shared by humans and androids, who have, over time learned to have primitive feelings.  The love story is strangely beautiful, poignant, sensual and sexual, and it brings out the best traits of the blade runner, compassion and a desire to protect. He learns from the androids, in ways, how to be more human himself.

 One of the most moving and thought-provoking scenes centers around a few lines of poetry that come, unexpectedly, from the deadliest android.  That scene has stayed with me since the first time I saw this movie in the 1990's. The motto of the company that creates the androids is ""More real than real.""  At the moment of the poetry, I was thinking that the androids were maybe ""more human being than human being,"" despite their penchant to ruthlessly kill in order to survive.  But then, many humans have this same primal tendency to do whatever is necessary to survive.

The suspense and tension of the story is always tightly wound, with surprises and twists, and supported by the post-Apocalyptic setting.  Movies often foretell the future. Now genetic engineering, at least of animals, is being done, and the genetic engineering of human beings seems bound to come next.  Blade Runner brings up so many questions about who the creator/Creator is and what the creator/Creator owes to those he has created, as well as what the creator/Creator can actually give as remedy for human fears--especially the fear of ceasing to exist.

105933,5,0790729628,"I had to buy this set to get a monologue version which was the one I first saw at the theater and loved. To me THIS is the definitive version of the film and no other will suffice. The monologue gives a Humphrey Bogart Sam Spade film Noir tone to the film and is far superior to the versions without it. The monologue tells the audience who Deckard is in the opening moments of the film.

 ""They don't advertise for killers in the Newspaper. That was my job, ex - cop, ex - killer, ex - blade runner."" How is the audience to supposed to understand Deckard's character without it ? The monologue puts the audience into Deckard's mind from the start.

Rutger Hauer is excellently cast as Roy Batty, the leader of the renegade replicants. He projects an aura of danger that is palpable to everyone. This is amply demonstrated in his confrontation with the genetic eye designer Chew. ""Fiery the angels fell.  Deep thunder rolled around their shoulders, burning with the fires of Orc."" ""Questions."" ""... Morphology? Longevity? Incept dates?

Hannibal Chew: Don't know, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes, ju-, ju-, just eyes... just genetic design, just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I design your eyes.

Batty: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes!

After finding out Eldon Tyrell is the person he is looking for and that JF Sebastian can get him in to see Tyrell, Batty slowly asks Chew, who is freezing,

""Now Where... would we find..... This JF Sebastian .....?

Fans of the film should check out the trivia section of the Blade Runner analyses on the IMDB web site. It is a gold mine of facts about the film and it's troubled production. I was fortunate to get this collection for a mere $ 5.00 because Circuit City was going out of business and was selling everything at dirt cheap prices.

I often wonder how prophetic certain films are about life as it unfolds. Corporations running everything like in James Caan's  ""Rollerball ?' Nah... HuH ? Robots like the ones in"" The Terminator"" or ""I Robot""  Oh Oh !

I really thought we would have a future that movies like 2001 showed when I first saw the movie. Sadly, after the press to beat the Russians to the moon, the space program began a slow death spiral. We could do these things if we weren't still trapped in a pre civilized mentality prevalent in so much of the world.

Not altogether ""good:"" doesn't follow modern American Christian values, has an ambiguous romantic scene with Rachel, which comes close to him forcing her. He is not immediately likeable, but we grow to like him as we see he is authentic in an age of manufactured goods and (literally) manufactured people: he is authentically sad, he is authentically tired, authentically attracted to Rachel, in a way that is sometimes ugly but sometimes soft and lovely.

Still an engaging take on the perennial SF theme of what it means to be human.  I was a little disappointed to find that the cinematography -- the famously atmospheric look and feel of the film -- did not measure up to my memory of it.  I suspect that's simply because its once-innovative expression of future L.A. has been imitated so often in the ensuing decades.  But I guess having imitators is sort of a benchmark test for ""classic"" status in film, and it's my view that Blade Runner deserves that status.

The plot is murky to the point that I wasn't sure if it had advanced at all until over half the movie was gone. Pacing was way off, I can't count the number of times I was left staring at an actor waiting for the scene to change with nothing happening. The lighting was also incredibly annoying to watch. I do not enjoy being strobed by lights in the background, even if for dramatic effect. One aspect I did appreciate was the topic of replicants, but I did not think the movie fully capitalized on this at all.

One thing is sure...  judging by the behavior of 'Roy', the murderous replicant played by Rutger Hauer, it's possible for them to go insane, and it's up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to hunt them down.

106178,5,0790729628,"Like Walt Whitman who revised Leaves of Grass until he reached the last page on his deathbed, Ridley Scott has been tinkering with his classic Blade Runner.

After various Directors Cuts, Scott has gone the butcher shop by coming up with chopped liver and Salisbury steaks. He has swept up the bits from the cutting room floor and installed them in the butchers window.

We finally got around to seeing the 2007 Blade Runner: The Final Cut.

If we settle upon this one as the cut above the rest, wed be rejecting all those versions that made 1982s Blade Runner one of the most mind-boggling and influential movies of its time.

Two movies changed the sci-fi landscape forever: Mad Max and Blade Runner. They made the future ugly and dirty, crowded and unpleasant. Throw in Alien (also by Scott) and you have a futuristic mess.

No, Ridley has not cleaned up the set. He now revels in the messiness. Gone is the wonderful narrative voice of Harrison Ford, explaining to us what was going on. Its not necessary because weve all seen the film before.

Adding a few moments amplifies the characters without a narrative megaphone. The film is strikingespecially from Sean Youngs Joan Crawford look to the smoky offices in the skyscrapers, and we still love Fords fey impersonation that loses nothing on Bogarts fey impersonator scene in The Big Sleep.

This 1940s detective film set in the 21st century lacks only Dooley Wilson, leaving Ridley Scott to play it again and again.

We wanted to see again if Deckard is really another replicant sent to retire other replicants. We have wondered about this for 30 years.

The Final Cut is brilliant. Its hard to do more than polish a diamond, even if you want to cut it into smaller segments to add more jewel facets.

The story is awesome too, in this one, our hero Deckard, a lonely 'Bladerunner' cop, gets pulled in by his old boss to do one more job.

Only this time, he must track down and kill 4 state-of-the-art 'Replicants', these are a kind of genetically engineered humanoid with exceptional strength agility and intelligence which just happen to be illegal on earth because they are so very dangerous.

106212,5,0790729628,"All the top reviews are of various editions of the film, so I thought I'd drop a review of the film itself.

This, singlehandedly, is the greatest scifi film of all time.

its genius is in its presentation of an unforgettable, frighteningly realizeable future world. it isn't just scifi, existential, noir, etc. it's all those things, like the real world. and like the real world, it doesn't exist to serve you the viewer, it exists independently of you, and meaning exists beneath the daily routines. Bladerunner, at its heart, is a simple enough detective story, but told with a master scifi artist's eye. bleakness, of light and hope, is its theme. paucity, of wealth and words, is its truth. monolithic corporations is its great adversary, not roy batty. overpopulation is the fatal flaw and, ultimately, humanity is the protagonist that may or may not survive, not just rick deckard. the romance wasn't sizzling - just an unsteady desperation that was just the right tempo for the world they lived in. and have you ever felt so heartbroken over the final defeat of the antagonist/victory of the hero? truly roy batty was one of the great complex characters in cinema.

Bladerunner is the alpha and omega of future noir - its better has not been seen since, and certainly not before. but it isn't for everyone. if you like your movies combustion heavy with much sprinting and mouth breathing, steer clear. This is a comparatively slow burn that subtly warps your worldview if you care even a bit about the fate of the world in which you live.",1404259200,,1546,4.782771535580524

Hauer's character's obvious love for the Pris (Darryl Hannah) character is as evident as Deckard's mixed emotions for Rachael (Sean Young).

106235,5,0790729628,"I'm admittedly biased. I love the sort of cyberpunk, grungy take on the future that Blade Runner portrays, I loved Vangelis's soundtrack, and I loved the imperfect characters. I'm also a big fan of Ridley Scott especially when he gets to play around with lighting.

This final cut (different from the ""director's cut"" which wasn't really a director's cut but...well...it's complicated) is likely the closest you'll get to what Ridley Scott wanted...sorta.

Long story short, Blade Runner had a rough ride and this end result is what happens when Mr. Scott finally had some time (and was allowed to) recut the film. It means they cleaned up the mess that was introduced by others after Mr. Scott was fired from the film in post-production and builds upon some of the fixes that went into the director's cut (thank you for no voice-overs...we've got brains, we can figure it out). Granted some of those fixes were in the Director's Cut (the voice overs), but this Final Cut includes a laundry list of fixes to the print including some notables like having Joanna Cassidy actually look like Joanna Cassidy in all her scenes.

All in all, I really love what they did. It's cleaner and better. I don't agree with everything that was done but I'm not the director. If you haven't seen the movie, this is the version to see. If you have but haven't seen this cut, this is the version to see. If you have no idea what Blade Runner is and want to see a gritty Sci-Fi movie about what LA will look like in 5 years as envisioned 32 years ago, this is the version to see.

And, if you watch it and still feel the need to ask the question about Deckard that most people ask by the end of the movie, well, then Mr. Scott did his job.",1404172800,,1719,4.482428115015974

As for the Final Cut version, I think it lacks something without the narration by Decker but it's still so full of imagery and detail that missing narration is just nit-picking.  I've always thought there was so much care taken to bring realism to each shot - for instance, the crane shot from inside the police headquarters where the camera pans down past what looks like decades of dirt and refuse scattered around the ceiling of the office before elegantly dropping in on what could only be a well used office filled with a collection of items one might expect from years of police work.

Another aspect of this films importance in Sci-Fi is the prognostications of future tech brought to life that really build the foundation for so many scenes.",1403913600,,913,4.772151898734177

It looks marvelous in high-definition as well.  I love the concept of this story.  Deckard may remember passing the Voight-Kampff, but was that memory implanted?...  You may believe in your reality, but is that belief real?  Philip K. Dick is masterful at presenting these questions through stories, and this movie is a masterful representation of the story.

Even Deckard. Those who enjoy the Neo-noir genre will inevitably enjoy this film but many (myself included) just do not find this film as a whole entertaining. I enjoy many different genre's of film, Sc-Fi included, however those who have yet to see the film (if you choose to watch it now) I find it extremely doubtful that at the end you'll say ""That was awesome""!  Many will say ""Oh but the film has so many complex themes about what it means to be human"" and I say ""I don't care, the movie is slow and boring"".

I'm just ecstatic that it is available! Some of my other favorite movies like Ken Russel's ""The Devils"" get no love at all!  It took me forever to find it - much less on a digital format! I eventually found a DVD, but the quality sucks!

I'd like to see more ""cult"" films get this treatment! A Clockwork Orange gets some love, but only in the form of a Kubrick collection.

I've read about how Alan King couldn't understand what was going on in the rough cut and took control away from Scott and added the narration. But I never before saw Blade Runner as Ridley Scott intended it. It is a work of genius. There are flaws: Harrison Ford was quite young then, and he hadn't quite developed his acting chops. Like the first three Stars Wars pictures, he's not really comfortable in his skin as an actor, but he looks great. Rutger Hauer does go way over the top. But the lead women are perfect and all the rest of the cast are impeccable. What is essential is the history of film with regard to Blade Runner is that it combines the most brilliant of noir with the most brilliant of sci fi.

I remember when I first borrowed a friends VHS copy of it years ago and was in love (never gave back the VHS!) everything about this film is well done, Ridley Scott created a masterpiece in every way. The story is based on  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  a  novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. First published in 1968, human like robots serving humankind.
It is a story way before it's time, and which we see in film after film;Terminator, I-Robot, AI, The Machine, Aliens and more.
It is plausible that some day in the future we will have robots serving society, and the idea of Artificial Intelligence  is not long off, and the concept that AI will get out of control is a real concern to many.
It has love, drama, adventure, mystery, and imagination. An all star cast even back then;
Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Rick Deckard, Rutger Hauer is also so believable as
Roy Batty, Sean Young is  a gorgeous Rachael and Daryl Hannah as
Pris is just plain amazing.
The lighting effects won an academy award, and for good reason, they are spectacular. The music by Vangelis fits the movie perfectly, I dream about it.
OK, I'm obsessed with the movie, yes, but it really is one of the top ten best Science Fiction films of all time, sits with The day the stood still (1), War of the worlds(1), Forbidden Planet, Star Man, ET, Star Wars, Alien and more.

I Want That 2 Hrs Of My Life Back! ...NOT Worthy Of Being Rated One Of the Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Of All Time! - JUNK!

""Blade Runner"" - Considered one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all time. Someone PLEASE explain to me WHY? 32 years later, after the original 1982 release, with the ""new improved"" release newly arriving on Amazon, I finally forced myself to sit down and watch it. I am QUITE a Sci-Fi fan. There is often little else I will watch other than science documentaries and Sci-Fi. I also look carefully at directors, producers and cast. I figured with Harrison Ford on board, how bad could it be. Well, let's just say, I wish I had that 2 hrs of my life back!

HOW ON EARTH could that movie have EVER been considered one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all time? There is NO science in it, the plot is non-existent, the acting is WORSE THAN BAD, the music is BAD even for the 80s synth generation, and the cinematography is AWFUL and so DARK that you can't see what is happening half the time, and FORGET keeping up with the ""story line"". Cop hunts down bad robots and falls in love with one of the robots. THAT'S IT! Even for the 32 year age of the movie I don't see how it stood up BACK THEN. All the Star Trek TV shows and movies which started 20 years EARLIER were better done, and let's not forget 2001 Space Odyssey which was MASTERFULLY done, so it is NOT an age thing.

106479,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner remains one of my top ten favorite films, no matter the variation, cut, or edit--in fact the only thing that could ruin this movie is the seemingly inevitable contemporary remake (please don't).  While loosely based on science fiction author Phillip K. Dick's masterful story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, this movie took on a life of its own with the rich styling, lavish attention to future detail, and character development.  Harrison Ford plays a Blade Runner, a futuristic cop of sorts, who is forced out of retirement to terminate ""replicants"" who have made their way to Earth ""illegally"".  These genetically designed humanoids look like humans in every way, but are designed to be capable of dangerous tasks that humans might otherwise not wise to do.  They are not, however, permitted on Earth.  Nearly all the rest of the population has left, migrating to other planets we assume, but those who cannot pass a physical, have to remain.  In one of the incarnations of the film, Ford's character offers noir styled narration to accompany the film, and this in many ways, to my way of thinking, was the best variation.  As it has grown in popularity though, that track was removed by director Ridley Scott and scenes of unicorns included--hmmm, cool narration by Ford, slo mo unicorns?  Cool narration by Ford, slo mo unicorns?  I will take the narration please...

In a final debate to keep the dream alive, Scott and others have thrown out their belief that Ford's character was himself a replicant, activated to hunt the other replicants.  I disagree, and have my ""evidence"" but will not discuss it here for fear of dealing out a spoiler in a review--which is just plain mean.  The music, design, and superb acting by a gifted cast come together for a film, that no matter its incarnation, is well worth watching more than once.

Sci fi without all the lasers, space battles and explosions of other movies, this is a very reflective look at the human condition and thirst for life set against a dark future.

Boy was I under-estimating one of the greatest sci-fi films ever! Not only was the cast in the infancy of most of their careers, pretty much everyone in this movie turned into a film superstar shortly afterwards.
Decker (Harrison Ford) was so believable in his character it wasn't even funny. Amazing is all I can say. I've had this movie on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray DVD. And on VHS I wore out 2 copies.
Not to besmirch the Star Wars fans but to me this film has a much better story line and the characters are closer to being believable. Even the concept of replicants is not that far away if you keep up with bio-engineering developments of today.

106544,5,0790729628,"What sets Blade Runner apart from its science-fiction brethren is its reliance on atmosphere and uncertainty over more obvious sci-fi tendencies like unnecessary convolutions or CGI-heavy battle sequences. Instead of giving the audience long-winded and confusing speeches about how this futuristic world came to be, we are given a few simple sentences from the start and then are completely entrenched in a totally vivid yet surreal society where the past and future collide. The film noir style contrasts splendidly with the flying cars and massive mechanized advertisements from Coke and Pan Am that loom over the dirty, crowded streets. It's far from just style however. The subtlety of its ideas is incredible. It doesn't beat the audience over the head with blatant symbolism or out-of-place philosophical spoutings. Blade Runner's theme of humanity runs deep through the story, and in true noir fashion, the audience is left with more questions than answers. The screenplay, based on legendary author Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, is a brilliant base for Ridley Scott's auteristic vision of America's future. His atmosphere is what makes Blade Runner an endurable piece of classic cinema. It's rich, stunning, hazy, and 100% Ridley Scott. The cast is truly iconic, featuring Harrison Ford in the peak of his career, Edward James Almos, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel, Brion James, William Sanderson, the then unknown talents of Sean Young and Daryl Hannah, and Rutger Hauer, who steals the show in the films closing quarter. The score by Greek composer Vangelis again mixes past and future elements through the use of synthesizers and classical piano pieces. Simply put, Blade Runner is a thought provoking masterpiece to be watched over and over again.",1402358400,,1787,5.273684210526316

106572,5,0790729628,"Contrary to original popular belief, ""Blade Runner"" is not a film that's all style/no substance--- but, fascinatingly, it wants you to THINK that it is (this is, of course, in marked contrast to the approach of most science fiction--- from ""Star Trek"" on down--- written by overenthusiastic Asimov-wannabes who pile on pseudo-philosophical as well as pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo in an effort to convince you there's more 'profundity' going on than the facts).  ""Blade Runner"" came out in 1982, one year after the debut of MTV, that incredibly kitschy and gimmicky era that saw the proliferation of such consumer mainstays as home video and home video games (wise guy viewers will of course never tire of cracking jokes about the ""Atari"" references, and indeed ""Blade Runner"" fell just short of predicting the rise of home computers), the year when the biggest and still best sci-fi fantasy classic could be summed up as 'boy-meets-alien'.  It simply wasn't the right moment for a thought-provoking postmodern sci-fi-fantasy epic (assuming any moment in the '80s would have been--- and someone probably should have sent David Lynch a memo), a fact which Ridley Scott himself must have been at least subconsciously aware of, emphasizing as he did imagery and ambiance over more conventional narrative methods of 'pulling us into' ""Blade Runner""'s philosophical themes.  The themes are there, all right, lurking moodily beneath the surface--- a surface populated in ""Blade Runner"" by awe-inspiring cityscapes, miniature Chinatowns that look like graphic novels, GIF-style skyscraper billboards advertising Coca-Cola, and of course sexy female androids whose look inspired two generations worth of anime.  ""Blade Runner"" works more like music than most sci-fi, noir, or comics, gradually and languidly taking you 'to another place' (and like a lot of great music it may not quite 'hit you' the first time around; it was only on a 2nd or 3rd viewing that I really started to feel, Oh yeah, I could WORSHIP this), as, granted, all great movies should.  Like listening to a Radiohead album, you know there's a cautionary tale about a dystopian future buried in there, but you just keep getting distracted by all that dreamy, dreary beauty.

106590,5,0790729628,"I saw this movie for the first time a few months ago, and had mixed feelings about it. I thought the special effects were great, the acting was good, Rutger Hauer was creepy, thats all good. The first time I watched it I thought it was way too slow paced, but after watching it like a hundred times I got used to it. Then I figured out how many cuts of the movie there was, and I knew I had to see them all. The final cut was the first way I watched it, But the workprint is surprisingly my favorite version. Below I will review each cut of the movie and my own rating.

Workprint; 9 out of 10
This version has no credits, less violence than the final cut, but it does add in some dialougue, and alternate music. Since the production company made Ridley change the movie for american audiences going to see it in the theater. This has NO Deckard Narration (thank god) and no happy ending, which I think is awesome they cut out.
Pros: It's the way it was originaly going to be shown so the releasing company didn't make them change it, Better music, alternate opening.
Cons: there is only one, and thats the low quality. I know they did there best to make it look good but it still isn't great.

US Theatrical Cut; 6 out of 10
Even though this is still a great movie, the narration and happy ending I don't really like. Not much to say.
Pros: Great BD quality, Less mind bending (no unicorn).
Cons: Already listed them. (Narration-Happy ending)

UK Theatrical Cut; 7 out of 10
I'm not obsessed with the gore in movies like some kids are, but it's still nice to see more blood in this version.
Pros: more blood
Cons: same as US version

Director's Cut; 8.5 out of 10
This is the first to omit the narration and alter the ending. The only new scene is the dream sequence which is hard to completely understand but I think I've got it, plus that scene only lasts like less than a minute. There is also some new altered musical cues not in the other ones.
Pros: Awesome
Cons: Lack of new footage

Final Cut; 8.4 out of 10
It's pretty much the director's cut with a lot of new enhanced footage. Some of the new footage is pointless. Why would we want to see harrison ford looking at news paper for 2 more seconds or stuff like that. But then there is stuff like changing a stunt doubles face, which is pretty cool.
Pros: Great BD Quality, Enhanced picture, Fixed mistakes.
Cons: Pointless new footage.

Special Features; 10 out of 10
Theres more than 9 hours of special features. They... Are... AWESOME!
Pros: Everything
Cons: Nothing

If you need to have three or four versions of a movie to get people to like it and agree about it, well just my opinion here, but that oughtta tell ya something about the real content of the movie. THAT'S what should be critiqued, not if there were a few more seconds or deleted or added scenes or conversations with the director or different endings or whether it came out on blue ray.
And personally, being a Harrison Ford fan, his best movie was without a doubt, ""Regarding Henry"".  It was his most dramatically challenging role ever.
Ridley Scott did a much better job in conveying the bleakness of the future in his post apocalyptic movie Aliens.

I'm a total sci-fi fan, AND I think Harrison Ford is an amazing actor.
But THIS movie, wow, I was nodding off after 30 minutes. I thought the opening scene was good, when Deckard was asking the replicant questions, mainly to ascertain whether or not if he had the one human emotion that all replicants lacked: empathy. The writer should have stuck with that theme because that could have turned it into a real sci-fi, psychological suspense. The plot was original, but adding the theme of the whole 80's punk rock scene (see thru plastic rain coats, Darryl Hannah's airbrushed eye shadow, etc) detracted from what COULD have been a truly original post apocalyptic suspense nail biter.

I guess I don't understand how a post-apocalyptic movie, made in the 80's, with the whole film noir theme (with shades of the 80's punk rock scene) is appealing or entertaining.

On the whole, I thought it was boring and dry (even though it's raining all the time in the movie). I DO understand the complexities that the story is trying to convey, but I think the director could have done much better in the adaptation of those deep philosophical undertones.",1397865600,2,2044,4.619834710743802

106631,4,0790729628,"I like Blade Runner, but I don't love it like others do.  It does have a lot going for it.  The sets, scenery, special effects, style and flair are all legendary.  However, it has some glaring flaws.  The first is the main character.  I can't stand Deckard.  There's nothing special about him.  He doesn't seem particularly smart, athletic or menacing.  Every single Replicant gets the drop on him and he only survives by their stupidity, lack of desire to kill him, or being bailed out by someone else.  Everyone else in the movie pushes him around as well.  So, how did a wimp like this guy every develop a reputation as THE most feared Replicant hunter?  Sure, he's portrayed as a burnout who's lost his edge, but still the movie should give me something here.  At least make him cunning.  The next thing I didn't like is the story.  It's filled with holes.  ** SPOILERS **  The whole thing with Voight-Kampf is nonsense.  So, the Replicant makers can create perfect/superior human clones, but have no way differentiating them from normal humans except for an eye test?  Seriously?  What, they don't have bar codes in the future?  How about the beginning scene with Leon?  I guess metal detectors are a lost science in the future as well.  Holden figures out he's a Replicant, but doesn't draw a weapon and still goes on questioning him.  Brilliant.  Zhora has the complete drop on Deckard (big shock) yet doesn't finish him because she is surprised by some employees.  She could have snapped his neck in seconds, but opts to take the slower route with strangulation.  Okay. The Replicants themselves are quite sloppy as they leave a trail that a 6 year old kid could follow, which of course is a bit challenging for Deckard.  Their goal is reasonable.  They want more life and are seeking out Tyrell, their creator.  You see, they only have a 4 year lifespan.  Why you would want to create accurate human clones and give them only a 4 year life span is beyond me.  I'm no scientist, but I could easily figure out that these super humans could rebel and cause havoc.  However, we can't expect such advanced thinking for characters in this movie.  Rachel is an interesting character, yet has almost zero purpose in this movie other than to provide a romantic interest for Deckard.  Of course, she is instrumental in bailing him out of danger when Leon is going to rearrange his face.  Pris also has a golden opportunity to waste Deckard, yet opts for a screaming gymnastics demonstration instead.  She does however give Deck his third vicious beating of the film, which is becoming a hobby for this boy among men.  Then comes the finale and the best Replicant goes into action.  Roy Batty. A bit smarter than the others, but a bit weird too.  He decides to play a little with Deck before killing him.  Breaks a couple of his fingers then pretends he is a wolf with Pris' blood smeared all over him.  With the howling of course.  Uh-yea.  He spends a few minutes hunting him until predictably catching the mighty Replicant hunter.  Then, he decides to spare his life.  Wow.  Sorry, but to say this story is over rated would be an understatement.

Still, if you love Blade Runner, this is THE set to own.  Nearly every version of the film is in this set.",1397692800,,3254,4.606643356643357

106665,5,0790729628,"It was sometime in 1996 that I first saw a s***ty cut of Blade Runner on one of those cheapo Walmart TV's with a VHS player built into it. I didn't like it so much. Then again, I was only 12 and more absorbed in my Spawn and Lobo comic books than this Ridley Scott masterpiece.

First things first... You HAVE to watch Blade Runner: The Final Cut on Blu-Ray. The imagery, intricate set pieces, and costumes is where this movie really shows itself to be a classic. Ridley Scott used a short story of Phillip K. Dick to craft an intelligent neo-noir film. Harrison Ford was perfectly cast as hard-boiled cop, Rick Deckard. He drinks his ass off and hunts replicants. Then he manages to bang one.

Blade Runner is a slow moving and often confusing flick. This is why it took me multiple viewings to grasp what Ridley Scott was trying to convey, coupled with the studio's cryptic editing style, finally made whole by this edition. Blade Runner, more than any other movie you will ever watch, is visually awesome. The neo-noir elements provide an even greater draw. This is simply the best Sci-Fi movie I have ever seen.",1395532800,,1115,4.54228855721393

It is not my favorite Ford movie but it was well done and Ford's acting was superb.

106671,5,0790729628,"I saw this film when it first came out and had mixed feelings when leaving the theater. I admired the production design or as we say the look of it and admired Rutger Hauer's galvanizing performance. The rest of the film and other performances stuck in my mind to this day. I watched the Final Cut on DVD and last night I watched the Blu-ray.  Although the DVD looked very good upscaled to 1080p on my Blu-ray player, the Blu-ray disc was stunning.  This is one of the best Blu-rays you will ever see & hear especially if you listen to the Dolby TruHD soundtrack. Do not hesitate to buy this disc. The careful restoration was approved by the director Ridley Scott and you know visuals are his trademark. The remixing of the soundtrack is impressive in its clarity and depth.

I won't go into a detailed comparison of the original version and this one which you can read elsewhere as each one has their champions. I will agree with those who miss Harrison Ford's voiceover. Originally the film was conceived as a film noir detective story from the 1940's transported into the future. Supposedly the studio added the narration because they felt audiences couldn't follow the plot. Some accounts said it sounded flat because Ford was against using it and didn't put his heart into it. I thought it worked as he sounded world weary adding more dimension to his tired character. Voiceover worked in Bogart films and other film noirs so this technique worked for me in this film.

The final version omits this narration and I do miss it especially for Ford's comment about why Hauer's character saved his life. The film does work without the  voiceover but I'm not sure if that's due to me seeing the original film several times and reading about it. I'd like to hear from people who never saw the original version to see if they had trouble following the plot without the voiceover.

Another omission is the more positive relaxed ending where Deckard and Rachael are seen miles way on their way to safety. I think that version works too but some like the unsure frantic ending of the final cut, It seems to me both versions of the film work in their own way and luckily both are available for fans. I would have liked to seen a cross between both versions using Scott's technical tweaking and the voiceover and original ending, but that's just me. Anyway 'Blade Runner' is a great film in any version and all the better on Blu-ray. And I won't touch the argument that Deckard might be a Replicant.

So far my review received only an unfavorable vote although I basically I praised this disc. Go figure...",1394841600,,2599,4.600431965442764

106710,4,0790729628,"If you want more dialog and more spacey visual effects, then this directors cuts, including the final cut, might be better than the original.  What you lose is a lot of the film-noir voice over and therefore the momentum and chameleon like nature of the original.  In this version the first half of the film is more like the second half of the original where it becomes about the applicants and their struggle for life an meaning, and not about a down on his luck retired blade runner / private eye.

But I remember the noir opening and costuming as an effective counterpoint to the rest of the film.  I didn't think it was false - I thought it was more of a red herring.  You mind assumes this is going to be about bending the law, resisting the fem fatale, surviving and ultimately foiling the bag guys, and getting the girl - at least temporarily.  But then you find out that that pattern only partially applies, which I thought was kind of cool and transformational in the original.

OTOH, if you see it for the 2nd, 3rd, etc time, you know the Noir voice over at the beginning is about where the character starts, his initial way of thinking and you know it isn't where he is going to end. It might seem a little gratuitous whereas the Directors and Final Cut versions don't put as much Noir spin on the character or the film so you have more time to reflect on the action as it actually unfolds, not as it either fits or breaks from the Film Noir mold.

I have to agree with the reviewer that says you should own both versions.  I bought this primarily to introduce my children to the classic.  I probably should have bought the theatrical release for that (first time viewing) because without knowing where the movie is going, this version is a very slow developer and just ins't grabbing their interest.

106713,5,0790729628,"Answer: This movie, appearing on every list of not only the greatest science-fiction films of all time, but the best movies ever made. ""Blade Runner"" is a movie that you have to not only see, but own, because it's one of the few monumental American classics, along with ""Casablanca"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""The Third Man"", ""Vertigo"" and ""The Godfather"", that gets better by age. Like most of these movies, ""Blade Runner"" was a critical and commercial bomb, ludicrously dismissed as style over substance, for lacking a coherent story and for its one-dimensional human characters. Seen today, in a time of economic recession, class division and the state's utter disregard to come in human terms, ""Blade Runner"" feels more modern and relevant than ever.

Why is ""Blade Runner"" one of the greatest movies of all time? I could write a lengthy review describing the movie's greatness, but I'll do the movie greater service by listing the reasons:

1.) It's a simple story, brilliantly told, tightly paced and superbly directed. A retired police officer is forced by the police state to hunt down (or ""retire"") a group of bio-engineered cyborgs called Replicants. Under Ridley Scott's tight direction, the movie is a gripping experience as we see the main character struggle to fulfill his obligations and survive. The opening sequence where Leon is interrogated as rather or not he's a Replicant and the scenes where Deckard is pursuing Pris in a room cluttered with mannequins are as suspenseful as the best of Hitchcock.

2.) The acting is utterly terrific. Harrison Ford probably gave the greatest performance of his career as the replicant hunter Deckard. Ford hated the movie and called it a miserable experience, yet in some ways, this helped add greater depth to his character, as we see Deckard's anguish, frustration and anger simmering throughout the movie. Sean Young is outstanding as the Replicant assistant Rachael and her scenes with Deckard, where he tries to teach her about love in his apartment, have an emotional intensity barely found in other sci-fi movies. Darryl Hannah made a huge impression as the lonely and tragic Pris and Edward James Olmos provides comic relief as the officer Gaff, who raises an ambiguous question at the end that still resonates to this day. But the highest acting honor, of course, belongs to Rutger Hauer, as Roy Batty, the movie's main antagonist. Subtle yet dangerous, a menace to society yet one with tragic grandeur, Hauer's Batty may rank as one of the greatest and most memorable villains in movie history.

3.) ""Blade Runner"" successfully continues the tradition that has defined science-fiction movies in decades, in that it presents the central theme that the most humane characters are in the fact the most inhuman. Despite their supposed lack of humanity, Roy Batty and Pris are arguably the most sympathetic characters in movie, primarily because they are outcasts who refuse to blend in to an oppressive society (see below). In fact, the general complaint about ""Blade Runner"" when it was released was that the replicants were more interesting than the hero, when that was precisely the point. There's a disturbing sequence where Deckard is hunting down a female replicant and instead of having the audience root for him, the movie defies conventions and has us hoping that the replicant escapes (there's even a hint in the movie's finale that Deckard himself may be a replicant). At the end, when Batty chooses his fate, you feel a great sense of sadness for this inhuman yet paradoxically humane character.

4.) No other movie, not even ""2001"" or ""Metropolis"", captures the feeling of being displaced, oppressed and and dehumanized in an oppressive society. One of the biggest reasons for the movie's initial failure was that it presented such a dark vision of a world where privacy is lacking, noise is abundant and commercialism runs rampant throughout the city. The sets, outfits, the insufferable rain and the cluttering masses on the street create a feeling of powerlessness, a feeling that prevents people from having the free will to be themselves. Deckard is a perfect example of that, as he is powerless towards a quasi-fascist police state that determines his fate or he will be part of the ""little people"". The movie is, for all its futuristic technology, is an expressive drama.

5.) ""Blade Runner"" has one of the best musical scores ever made. Composed by ""Chariots of Fire"" conductor Vangelis, the music is a groundbreaking merge of futuristic synthesizers, organic compositions and even an element of jazz, as seen in the beloved ""Love Theme"", with its beautiful saxophone solo. You can listen to this music without seeing the film and imagine the whole movie in your head.

6.) ""Blade Runner"" seems more relevant and prophetic today than it was released in 1982. Critics and moviegoers were taken back by seeing such dark, dreary vision, a vision where the rich care so little about the poor that they form a hostile, miserable ghetto. Yet walk down the inner slums of any city, from Los Angeles in early 1990s and Moscow to Tokyo and that vision is there before our eyes. Technology, which was supposedly man's gift to preserve humanity, has slowly overtaken our human traits, making us cold, mechanical and increasingly dependent on machinery.

And yet...

7.) The movie, despite its darkness, ends with a suggestion of hope. When Batty spares Deckard's life and delivers that immortal monologue which has earned its place in cinema, this scene suggests a promising hope in the future: that machines and human, instead of striving to dominate the other, can live side-by-side in harmony. This is not a hippie message, but a heartfelt plea for everyone in diverse groups to coexist and accept one another.

""Blade Runner"" is one of the American cinema's most towering achievements and an institution for every science-fiction entity that has come afterwards, from ""The Matrix"" and ""Dark City"" to ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Cowboy Bebop"", from the fantastical adventures by Hayao Miyazaki, to the grim, political fables by Guillermo Del Toro and Alfonso Cuaron. Even ""The Fifth Element"", in some ways, plays like a sunny, cartoony alternative to this grim classic. It is essential that you watch ""Blade Runner"", even if you don't like it (which is highly doubtful). If you even think of starting a Blu-Ray/DVD collection without it, then you are simply just one of the ""little people"".

Strongest recommendation to steal at all costs.

P.S. Like many great movies, ""Blade Runner"" has come out in a variety of editions, each of them a worthy purchase. There was a five-disc ultimate collector's edition that came out on both DVD and Blu-Ray. That is currently out of print. In its place, there was 30th anniversary edition released in two box sets: a multi-format version (with that memorable Asian face on the front cover) and a three-disc set released with only Blu-Rays (that's the one with the unicorn on the front cover). Either version you watch is fine, but if you just want the Blu-Rays in an affordable set, go with the three-disc set. Besides nearly a dozen hours of supplements, the picture and audio qualities are excellent. Since ""Blade Runner"" is an intensely visual experience, it is highly recommended that you watch it on a big screen and with big speakers. As the saying goes, the bigger, the better...in everything.",1393977600,29,7412,5.017073170731707

106743,4,0790729628,"Ridley Scott's moody dystopian epic has achieved ""cult classic"" status, and one can see how it would appeal to the special effects nerds -- not just because special effects are strikingly employed to visual ends in the movie but because the movie is ABOUT the special effects called ""replicants"" who have been created to do dirty work on the ""off world"" plantations for a major corporation and have now come home, not to roost but to raise some mayhem as they have come to realize the nature and extent of their programing.  So . . . this is a movie about a slave revolt, in a way (""Four Years a Slave,"" given the pre-programmed lives of the replicants) and about ""real"" people being forced to realize that the replicants are more ""human"" than they were intended to be.  They had been designed to be without feelings, but the movie shows that in their genetically programmed embodiments, they DO have feelings and they do have self-consciousness.  One assumes that the possession of a body and the experience in space-time in an embodied state is going to instantiate in such creatures the characteristics that we would call human.  And to drive that point home, it's the human characters who seem most affectless and soulless.

Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a ""blade runner,"" or cop whose particular mission is to destroy rogue replicants, and he's very good at it -- a kind of killing machine, as his boss says.  I notice that some critics and reviewers assume that Deckard is himself a replicant, although he doesn't know it, but I don't think that makes thematic sense -- it seems better to consider him a soul-less human who learns to regain some of his humanity from his interactions with self-conscious replicants like Rachel (Sean Young) and Batty (Rutger Hauer).  That fine irony would be lost if Deckard himself is a replicant.  The movie's story is about how he tracks down and wipes out the group who have returned, mainly it seems with the motive of getting themselves humanized by further genetic tampering, but who are willing and able to use violence when threatened.  All of this takes place in a vividly imagined futuristic urban setting, with extremes of elegance and grime that have become familiar in movies as a visual style partly in response to the power of Scott's images here (think of Gotham City in the Batman movies).  So there are chases and fights -- and it is in the treatment of that action that the movie drags a bit, although not too damagingly -- the whole thing comes in just under two hours.

The real power of the movie is its emotional force.  Apparently a lot of trouble was gone to in order to cast Deckard, and Harrison Ford does a fine job -- but the character isn't all that interesting or fully written.  The real stars are Rutger Hauer and Sean Young as the replicants with feelings and acute self-consciousness.  Hauer is marvelous, whether in full-out action anti-hero mode or in his more reflective moments.  He has two very powerful scenes -- one where he meets his maker (which I won't spoil for you), and one where he mourns the death of a replicant played by Daryl Hannah.  His own death scene is visually and emotionally powerful, as he has come to the end of his four year span just as he is being confronted by Deckard.  After a chase, during which he is getting the better of Deckard, his last act is to save the man who has been trying to kill him.  In his final speech he calls himself a slave, and as he dies he's like a puppet whose strings have been cut -- all of this on high rooftops in the rain, and quite spectacularly filmed.  Sean Young's character. Rachel, has been differently programmed -- for service in this world and not on some planet -- and physical violence seems not to be in her mix, so her melancholy expresses itself more in a desire for human connection, which, by the end of the movie, Deckard has become able to provide -- though what the temporal extent of their future together is, who knows?

106755,5,0790729628,"This version looks and sounds great. So nice that Ridley Scott has had so many opportunities to undo the damage done by the moronic studio executives who mauled the theatrical edition.

For those youngsters who don't remember the ""American"" version, here's the background. Hollywood execs underestimated the intelligence of American audiences (never an easy thing to do), and thought they wouldn't be able to follow the story line without help. So they superimposed a Harrison Ford voiceover, with him narrating what was happening, as if for kindergartners.

Ridley, being British, was used to dealing with more sophisticated audiences. For instance, at the end, when Ford picks up the foil unicorn, he assumed viewers would understand that Edward James Olmo's character was telling him: ""I was here. I could have killed her, but I didn't. Go for some happiness, dude!""

If an American director had done the movie (like Spielberg, who always appeals to the lowest common denominator, which is why he's so rich), they would have Ford say ""thank you"", to help audiences understand the significance of the origami.

Blade Runner bears the distinction of being the only movie that the presence of the incomparably incompetent Sean Young didn't ruin. Scott was smart enough to see that her wooden, robotic style was perfect for an android. Too bad later directors didn't understand that ""robot"" was her only mode.

I was disappointed to find the voice overs removed. It made the story confusing, brooding and boring. My son lot interest quickly. I had to explain a lot of what was happening and why things were being done from what I remembered of the original narration.

I showed him the original ending and deleted scenes on YouTube to try to explain what made the movie exciting to me.

Of course, the film itself is as crisp and brilliant as it has always been.  Gaff's spookiness is still eerie, the musical score is still chilling, Sean Young is still the beautiful embodiment of a wistful Pinnochio and the final 'Tears in the Rain' moment between Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford remains the most eloquent expression of humanity since Shakespeare's Shylock first uttered ""Do we not bleed?""",1391644800,2,781,5.290322580645161

106836,5,0790729628,"A great movie with early appearances of later stars (Harrison Ford, Darryl Hannah).  Phillip K Dick is a science fiction master and no film presents his skill better.  A little frightening that it is set in 2019, but probably the date could be stretched to, let's say 2319, and be a little closer to our current reality.  Considering that the author wrote this as a short story in 1968, you have to be amazed at his prescience - who could conceive then of a business turning out human clones for commercial purposes?  The plot is inscrutable (even as you watch it a second and third time) and the ambiguity of Harrison Ford's character is masterly presented.  Does he have any relationships (aside from polishing off ""skin jobs"").  What's with the collections of family pictures in his apartment - are they keepsakes or, like Rachel, does he keep them to reassure himself he's human?  Is he human?  He's awfully good with his gun and physical prowess (like the replicants).  The pathos of animate beings seeking survival with the sympathy of their creators also plays well against the sinister plot background.  This is a movie to be enjoyed, savored and reconsidered at intervals.  It is also a good starting place to begin reading Phillip K Dick's imaginative stories.",1390608000,,1270,4.833333333333333

This is one of my favorite movies, and I prefer the version with the narration; that underscores the ""filme noire"" aspect, as well as the 40's detective vibe underscored by the art deco architecture, clothing and hair style of Rachel.  I don't like the hinting at Deckard being a replicant, I think it's more poignant and lends more pathos with Decard finding love with a replicant.  It underscores the theme of just what it means to be human.  In sparing Deckard's life, Roy Batty becomes a ""real boy"", even releasing his ""spirit"" (the dove) at the end with his final loss of function/quasi-death.  For Deckard to have killed him, an unarmed man, would have been murder.  Also rather churlish what with Roy having just spared his life and saved him.  Findiing the origami unicorn at Deckard's place said Gaff had the chance to kill Rachel and let her live, a sort of balance for Roy's act of mercy.  Turning it into a ""hint of replicanthood"" for Decard just seems coy and prescious.

I first saw the movie when it originally came out in the 80's. Seeing it again was even better, got more out of it this time. If you like existential themes then you should really like Blade Runner. If you look deep, you will see the dichotomy of man in this movie and biblical themes throughout. The only drawback is the time setting of 2019, back in the 80's one could imagine a blade runner world in 2019, but not five years from now, 2014. But that also give thought to the falasy of predicting a debase terrible earth because of corporate greed and unbridled profit.

It was like watching a new movie, everything is so crystal clear and brighter.  All these scenes where everything was so dark and now I can make out all those streets and houses and backdrops and they look amazing! This one is the editied ""Director's Cut"", which I'll be honest, I didn't notice any new/altered/longer scenes at all.  It seemed to me to be the same movie as the last cut they realeased of it.  It is different then the ""original"" cut I've seen on TV, where Harrison Ford does all that narrating, but its no different then the release they did a few years ago.  No narrating in this one. I highly suggest the Blu-ray version to all Blade Runner fans- its truly a masterpiece.",1388016000,6,821,4.551020408163265
106934,5,0790729628,"Much discussion of this historic and precedent setting film has already been written so I see no need for providing yet another summary or my opinions on performances, meanings etc, so, as I always do, I will focus solely upon the actual quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.

VIDEO..
  The video transfer in my opinion is just excellent.  That Ridley Scott, the director, in a short 'extra' says that he supervised the remastering and reediting is good enough for me to settle on this 'final' version.  The Blu Ray was very clean for a film this old with no noticeable grain, artifacting or banding anywhere that I could see.  The color grading comes in as being very warm and, in parts, golden.  Much of the film takes place in dark surroundings yet details can easily be seen and even raindrops do not come as a blur but as individual drops.  I have no doubt that this final transfer was completely remastered and we reap the imaging reward.

AUDIO.
  The audio is a lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 that I wish were a 7.1 mix but I can't complain.  The re editing of the audio is absolutely excellent with a plethora of discreet directionality to all the surrounds on a very frequent basis.  Your LFE channel will get its share of work to do as well.  There are a number of rear stage to front stage and visa versa audio pans, the audio of rain fx will fully immerse you and other foley fx are plentiful enough.  They really did a great job on re mixing the audio for the home theater enthusiast.

EXTRASAside from the 37 second introduction to the film by Ridley Scott, the only other extras are a number of commentaries which I have not listened to as yet.

Blade Runner: The Final Cut is definitely worthy of being in your collection and many parts are of the film are totally demo worthy as well for showing off your theater system.

I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.  All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.

106957,5,0790729628,"I won't debate the plot of Blade Runner - if you haven't seen it, see it. For me, I was torn between the director's cut and the theatrical version of the film. The theatrical version features an after-the-fact narration, which neither director Ridley Scott nor Harrison Ford wanted. The studio felt the audience wouldn't be able to understand what was going on and needed it explained. I disliked most of the narration, although it did add a nice touch at the end of one character's life (trying to avoid spoilers). In this version, a happily-ever-after scene was also added, which I felt wasn't necessary but again seemed more satisfying for viewing audiences.

Having said all that -- the additional footage in the director's cut, too me, was unnecessary. There is some extra blood and gore. I was surprised to hear one of my favorite lines changed from ""I want more life, ""F-er"" (Amazon needs me to say that instead of the actual word), to ""I want more life, FATHER."" Wha...? I watched it with my teenage son, and while he did have a couple of ""why"" questions, he had no trouble following the storyline or figuring out what was happening. Some of the build up to action seemed slower.

So I remain on the fence. Both versions are beautifully directed, with wonderful actors, great story, memorable lines, gorgeous images. Just excellent. I intend to buy the other version to compare and try to decide which I like best.",1387756800,,1422,4.729838709677419
106958,4,0790729628,"BOTTOM LINE: Even if you own other cuts or versions of BLADE RUNNER, regardless of format, if you have a Blu-ray player then this ""Final Cut"" Blu-ray is an easy upgrade recommendation.

THE STORY: In the distant dystopian future, a overworked rundown cop ('blade runner') is assigned to locate and take down four androids ('replicants') that apparently went haywire and have now returned to Earth to locate & kill those responsible for creating them.

THOUGHTS: I've rented or owned two or three versions of this film in the past. According to Ridley Scott, this is his absolute last word on it. I hope he's right because I can't afford to by another 'new' version every other year or so. LOL. I love the movie for it's senses-staggering design more than the actual plot or writing. This thing is basically a thinly-veiled 1940's film noir dressed in futuristic excess. But what gorgeous excess it is! There is so much for the eye to feast on in this movie... no matter what part of the film you're watching or where your eyes are looking within the film frame. Even after several versions and multiple viewings over the last 30 years, I still find myself discovering new things to gasp at. If more than a year or two goes by between viewings of BLADE RUNNER, it's the optical equivalent of a sledgehammer blow to sit back and watch it again.

THE BLU-RAY: I'm pleased to report that BLADE RUNNER: THE FINAL CUT looks absolutely fantastic. Details I'd never noticed before are suddenly popping out from every corner of every frame, it seems. Rich, rich detail for your over-loaded eyeballs plus a room-filling sound design, including that sumptuous score by New Age composer Vangelis, to delight your ears. There are a TON of goodies thrown in that will keep fans of the film busy for hours. I haven't watched every release version of the film that's out there (too many to count) but I can say that this particular release is a SOLID value and is recommended.",1387670400,,1960,4.708454810495627
106959,5,0790729628,I have all versions of this movie and I like them all. The atmosphere and the story just grabs me and hold me all the way through every time. As the TV and DVD technology has gotten so much better you can enjoy it more than ever.,1387584000,,229,3.893617021276596
106960,5,0790729628,"I have been a fan of Blade Runner since it first came out; I have always been both intrigued and repulsed by the world of Blade Runner which has exercised a fascination over my imagination that will probably never let go. Every so often I have to revisit that world and watch each time with renewed interest as the story unfolds.

The movie is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick called, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" In this case I found I actually enjoyed the movie more than the book.

Were I to guess I would say that most people could be divided into one of two groups, those that are intrigued and repulsed and those that are only repulsed; if you've seen the movie before you probably already know which group is your group. I'll address my comments to the former group and those who have never seen the movie.

If you've never seen the movie and you're a devoted science fiction fan then you'll likely be part of the first group; if you're not a science fiction fan then the jury is out on you.

This collection is, to the best of my knowledge, the ultimate collection for the Blade Runner fan; the collection includes Disc 1, ""The Final Cut (2007), Disc 2, Original Theatrical Cut (1982), International Theatrical Cut (1982) and the Directors Cut (1991), Disc 3 includes ""Workprint and Special Features""

Also included are 40 pages of assorted sketches, art work and photos of the making of the movie and scenes from the movie.  I bought this version in spite of the fact I have two previous versions on Laser Disc and one on DVD; I guess that sort of marks me off as a fan of the movie.

If you're a fan of science fiction and you've never seen this movie, then you have a real treat in store; I encourage you to go ahead and get this version which has so much to offer. If you've got an earlier version, well I can say to you I'm really glad I added this one to my collection and suspect you'll be glad you did if you decide to take the plunge and buy another copy for your collection.",1387497600,13,2004,4.3138297872340425
106961,5,0790729628,"The first time I saw this film my reaction was rather Ho-Hum!  An exciting Harrison Ford movie, kind of a Science Fiction meets Film Noir with a somewhat happy ending, but nothing to write home about.  Yet there was something about it that struck a cord in me, something that wouldn't let go.  A year or so latter when director Ridley Scott released his ""director's cut"" I went to see it again and was electrified!  Gone was Ford's voice-over narration and the ""uplifting"" (?) flight to freedom that closed the original release.  Gone also was the Film Noir overtones that marred the the first go-around, in its place was one of the finest science fiction films that I've ever seen.  Filled with relentless tension the ""new"" Blade Runner was a completely different movie that explored the human condition and what it means to be human.  The directors cut was graced with a kind of cliff-hanger ending that questions Deckard's and Rachael's long term survival.  Deckard's dream was also added back into the film and that few seconds of footage is what radically changed the movie.  At last I could answer some of the questions I had.  What did Gaff's last origami mean to Deckard? What was Gaff referring to in his last speech to Deckard?  ""It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?"".  But even now there are some unanswered questions for me, and possibly, for you too.  How did Roy Batty know Deckard's name?  Why was Batty mocking Deckard's humanity in their final confrontation?  And lastly: is Deckard a Replicant?  The stunning music by Vangelis and harpist Gail Laughton set the mood for the film with an eerie, other worldly, feel.  Dick Morrisey's bluesy saxophone solo for the ""Love Theme"" is legendary on the Jazz circuit.  These people are joined by a host of other musicians and singers that bring it all together in a seamless ode to the art of movie making. The ethics of using non-human robots or some sort of half-human android to replace humans in dangerous environments has been the subject many works of fiction over the years.  The one that comes to mind for me is an episode of ST:TNG where Data is put on trial for his ""life"" to determine if ""he"" is a sentient being or if ""it""  is just a toaster.  The same holds true for Replicants.  A woman I know once said, upon viewing the film for the first time: ""This is so sad, they just want to live!"".  My friend had, unknowingly, gone straight to the heart of Blade Runner.  This is one of those movies that people either hate or love.  I think that what you take out of this film depends on what you want to put back into it.  It's either a complicated pot-boiler with an incomprehensible plot or it's a subtle reminder of who we are and where we come from.  Note: this 4 disk set is the way to go if you can swing it.  It offers 4 different versions of the movie for you to compare.  Check it out and see what your favorite version is.  I know what mine is!

The story is interesting as, in additional to sci-fi, it raises some realistic philosophical questions as to where we are going with computerized this that and everything else.  Science has gotten ahead of us; hence the need for Blade Runners.  The computerized snooping into everyone's phone calls, emails and on-line purchases is in the current news.

106987,5,0790729628,"After 30 years, this film still stands alone. Every shot and every scene immerses you into a dystopic Los Angeles in the fictional year of 2019. The film is loosely based off of the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" written by science fiction mastermind Philip K Dick. Legend has it that production was so painstakingly done by director Ridley Scott, the cast and crew despised working on the film until it's wrap.

The story is essentially a futuristic noir tale about a retired detective named Rick Deckard who is called back into service to forcefully retire a group of rogue androids. Blade Runner boasts one of the great protagonists in the genre and even in all of cinema. The film is notorious for having an abnormal amount of releases until the director's final release, The Final Cut, which Sir Ridley himself says is his favorite version of the film. Vangelis, an electronic composer popularly used for feature films during the 1980's, writes the greatest and most fitting score of his career.

Together the music and imagery operate in perfect harmony and delivers a dark and rain laden vision of a dystopia that is truly captivating. The prodigious fantasy of a black and starless future is one with trash lined gutters under sunless streets.

If you're not familiar with the film, it is an excellent film that attained cult status in 1992 when it was rereleased.  The original theatrical version had an abysmal voice over that pulled you out of immersion in the film to explain things you could have figured out on your own from context, or that didn't help the enjoyment of the film.

For example, in one place the narration of the theatrical release explains the language spoken in the slums of the future, where it comes from and who speaks it.  In this version in the same spot, there is music building dramatic tension.  Notoriously, the voice over originally contradicted the ending of the film, explaining the finish differently from how it actually happened.  Harrison Ford, Ridley Scott, the director, and even the author of the voice over hated it, but the studio insisted because early test audiences found the movie confusing.

This version does not have that voice over, and it's a great version of the film.

107092,3,0790729628,"Having just finished reading ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" I was curious to see how the movie version handled the story. No surprise, it was totally changed from the original version except that a few of the names were the same as in the book.  In the book, the setting was San Francisco, movie - Los Angeles. What I found to be most confusing is that it rained continuously, the characters dressed in 1940 styles and the buildings were hideous, over sized Mayan style structures which gave the set design anything but a futuristic appearance.

There was no reference to Androids, Mercer, electric sheep, Isodore & the Specials or any of the other significant characters from the book. The movie put great emphasis on a set design that did not match the story line, shallow character development and a style that is a replica of the 1940's Sam Spade movies.

If I had seen the movie first, I would not have bothered reading the book.  As usual, the story, characters and scenes created by a great author like Philip K. Dick far exceeds the interpretation in a movie. I was not surprised but I certainly was disappointed. I can understand why some other reviewers rated it as a great movie because of the usual mix of sex & violence portrayed in an impressive cinematic production. As far as a movie is concerned, I could have rated it higher but regarding the adherence to the original story, I probably rated it too high with a 3-star rating.",1382745600,,1451,4.634241245136187
107093,5,0790729628,"There's not a lot else to say about this film that hasn't yet been said I imagine; but, hey ho!  Scott interpreted Dick's dystopian view of the future to produce, what at the time of first release, in 1982, must have seemed an astonishing view of what life might look like in 2019.  Now we are only a few years away it's hard to decide how accurate that vision was.  The action is set in the Los Angeles of the time and it rains a lot; so, from a meteorological viewpoint, I guess not very accurate!  Scott's 2019 L.A. looks a bit more like I might imagine a future New York to look or, perhaps, Chicago which, in some respects, it almost does.  But wherever, it still looks amazing visually echoing as it does the look of Fritz Lang's seminal `Metropolis': in terms of production design, Len Wiseman's Philip K. Dick adaptation, Total Recall, released only in 2012, seems hardly to have moved anything on.

The casting is near perfect: M. Emmet Walsh brings a noirish feel to sleazy police captain Bryant and even though, incredibly, the film's screenwriter, Hampton Fancher, is reputed to have `seen' a 75 year old Robert Mitchum in the lead role, Harrison Ford is a perfect fit and gives a suitably laconic `Mitchum-like' performance as world weary cop Dekard.  Rutger Hauer as the ultra-violent but oddly sympathetic super Nexus-6 Replicant `boss' Roy Batty, also, seemed perfect casting and the beautiful Sean Young (whatever happened to her?) captures the insecurity and fragility of the `is she or isn't she a' Replicant, Rachael.

To name a few Fifth Element, Total Recall reboot, I Robot, Minority Report, Judge Dredd Reboot...just about anything with flying cars, overcrowd culturally diverse modern cityscapes and heart-thumping jumping from building to building chase scenes. If it was made after 1982, they probably were at least influenced by this movie. Way ahead of its time and no computer generated anything, Blade Runner in my humble opinion, is in the top 5 Sci-Fi movies of all time, but its my personal favorite (dare I say it - even above Star Wars). OH NO HE DIDN'T! Watching it for the first time you probably couldn't tell it was made in the early 80's because the cinematography is that good. But all the actors are 31 years older now and some of the companies no loner exist (Pan Am being one of the more prominent).

107160,4,0790729628,"Blade Runner, Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi masterpiece, is both a critique of our human need to create and an exploration of what it means to be a human. The film starts with an explanation to the viewer that, early in the twenty-first century, the ""Tyrell Corporation"" has advanced robot evolution into the next phase, having achieved the ability to produce ""replicants""--artificial beings virtually identical to humans. Replicants are superior to humans in strength and agility, and are at least equal to the genetic engineers who created them in intelligence. At the time of the film's beginning, replicants have mainly been used off-world as slave labor and in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny by a team of ""Nexus 6"" replicants on an off-world colony, however, replicants have been declared illegal on Earth and have been barred from traveling between planets. ""Blade runners,"" on the other hand, are human detectives whose priority is to hunt down and kill--or ""retire""--any replicants who have illegally made their way to Earth. The replicants' original designers were afraid that their creations, after a certain period, would develop emotional responses of their own--such as love, hate, and anger--and so they gave all replicants a four year lifespan. It is my belief that this film, in its use of a futuristic setting and its portrayal of the relationship between humans, blade runners, and replicants, showcases our deeply human need to create, reveals how our acts of creation can have unintended consequences, and explores what exactly make us human.
 There is a scene early in the film where a replicant, Leon, is interrogated by a blade runner who uses the ""Void Kampf Test,"" which searches for emotional responses in a test subject by measuring the movement of the subject's eye while the subject is asked targeted questions. The blade runner asks Leon to ""tell me only the good memories you have of your mother."" Leon does not answer and instead shoots the blade runner, ending the interview. Leon's reaction shows he knew he could not respond to the question in the emotional way expected of a human because he has, in fact, no memories of his mother. His instinct was to kill the interviewer and end the questioning. This suggests that memory is what makes us human. If one can detect emotional responses to memories, then one could tell who is human and who is artificial.
 Another scene that illustrates this point comes about a third into the movie, when the main protagonist in the film, the blade runner Deckard, is asked go to the Tyrell Corporation and apply the ""Void Kampf Test"" to a potential replicant held there. Dr. Tyrell, however, asks for the test to be performed on his assistant, Rachel, to show that it can positively identify a human. However, the interview with Rachel goes on much longer than usual and Deckard comes to the conclusion that Rachel is a replicant who believes herself to be human. He then asks Dr. Tyrell how it can be possible for Rachel not to know who she really is, to which Dr. Tyrell responds that Rachel is, in fact, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece. Dr. Tyrell's experimentation reflects our basic human need to create and continue to improve upon our creations. By giving this replicant memories, he has created a more advanced being that is harder to detect as artificial. This again suggests that one of the most human characteristics is the possession of memories. Rachel, when she finally realizes that she is a replicant, becomes intensely emotional and does not know how to cope with the revelation that, although she has human memories, she is not human.
 Replicants were created for use as slave labor in off-world colonies, freeing actual humans from hard and hazardous jobs. However, as Deckard puts it, ""replicants are just like any other machine, they are either a benefit to society or a hazard. If they're a benefit, then it's not my problem."" If the machines we create to benefit society turn into hazards and cause humans to become hurt or dead, are they worth the effort and time it takes to create? It seems clear that our creations, even if we make them with good intentions, can have unintended, and even disastrous, consequences, especially if we give our creations the ability for thought and reasoning. If we are to allow our creations to think, then we must put in place certain safeguards to diminish the possibility of their uprising against us. One scene in the film in particular deals with this insight. Roy, the leader of a group of replicants on Earth, is on a mission to discover his incept date in order to prolong his life. He discovers his creator is Dr. Tyrell and believes the doctor has the power to prolong his life. When he meets with Dr. Tyrell near the end of the film, Roy realizes that the doctor does not have the power to prolong his life and so kills Dr. Tyrell in a very horrific manner. While creating Roy, Dr. Tyrell almost certainly did not think his most advanced creation to date was going to be what ended his life. There was no possible way of knowing this would happen. In an earlier scene, we see Leon and Roy, on their quest to elongate their lives, appear at the workplace of a genetic eye designer named Chen. They use harmful interrogation tactics on him and discover that their creator was Dr. Tyrell and that they should find a genetic designer named J.F. Sebastian to learn more about their incept dates and longevity. They then kill Chen with no sympathy or compassion, which shows that they have no respect for human life.
  Another interesting scene comes about half way through the movie, when Roy and another replicant, Pris, discover the location of Sebastian and proceed to his building in order to try to access Dr. Tyrell through Sebastian. Sebastian, a leading genetic designer at the Tyrell Corporation and sufferer from an advanced aging disease, recognizes immediately that they are ""Nexus 6"" replicants, admiring them for being perfect, and bonding with them because they, like him, have short lifespans. He then asks them to show him something that they could do. Roy replies, ""We're not computers, we're physical."" Pris then replies, ""I think Sebastian, therefore I am,"" before performing some gymnastic moves and reaching her hand into a pot of boiling water. Pris' response shows how these replicants have an understanding of what it means to be alive and suggests that they may see themselves as more human, at least in some ways, than many actual humans. Sebastian lives alone in an enormous building and has contact only with the toys and friends he has created. This reflects, once more, our constantly felt human need to create, be it for industry, to solve problems, for companionship, or simply for the act of creation itself.
 The final scene in the film has Deckard face off against Roy in dramatic fashion upon the roof of a building in the middle of a rainstorm. As Deckard hangs off the edge of the building, in danger of falling to his death, Roy states, ""it's quite an experience to live in fear--that's what it means to be a slave."" Roy then pulls Deckard back onto the roof and says to him, ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe, but all those moments will be lost in time like tears in the rain."" He then takes his last breath and dies in front of Deckard. This scene shows that Roy knew his end was near and understood that, even for humans, no memory will survive one's death. Even our most advanced creations will inevitably come to an end.
 In closing, I feel that Ridley Scott's Blade Runner shows how we, as humans, have a constant need to create, even though our acts of creation may very well have unintended consequences. The film explores human experience and asks what it means to be human. I believe the scenes I have discussed here are great examples of this exploration and this questioning. I feel Blade Runner should be seen by anyone interested in our future and the direction we might be going as a society  . Though I know it is very difficult to predict what our own future may hold, I know for certain that we will continue to create new and exciting things, because such creation comes naturally to us as humans. I also believe, having taken Blade Runner to heart, that one of the main things that makes humans so human are the memories we accumulate through life, as well as the particular way we use those memories to experience the world around us.",1380499200,,8532,4.79537729435758

I left the theater stunned.

then years later VHS comes out and I see an add that there is a different version. supposedly the corrected version. I bought it instantly.
I ended up buy 3 copies I watched it so often.
The hook for me is that, like Alien, this wasn't a space fantasy. This was actual science fiction. Except for 2001, real science fiction movies were, and are, rare.
Most what claims to be are actually just fantasy masquerading as science. This was realistic and dirty and brutal. Ridley Scott knew how to make a movie back then.

I like this set mostly as a tome of the history of a classic movie. I don't find any one version (there are 5 here) perfect. There are flaws in each, but different flaws. But with movies this huge you an look past them and see what, maybe, Ridley Scott saw.

I have a hope that at some point in the not too distant future that, now that Star Wars has been removed form Lucas' endlessly tinkering hands, that a set like this will one day come out of A New Hope. then finally we can see each version of that movie side by side, and the same progression of thought that made it the single best of the set.",1379203200,,1223,4.217948717948718

When it came out to the theaters many patrons were shocked that it was not more like Star Wars. It does have Harrison Ford and Star Wars was still the new yard stick for being a film of the sci fi genre. Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien) it was slammed by the critics and public so much that it was yanked from theaters quickly.
The film did get to the public when released on video years ago and has been going strong ever since. It is the film that would not go away. Retrospectives and internet dicussions are still giving this film endless reavaluatios and critisism.
This version is excellent the transfers are very clean with no visible defects and sound is some of the best I have ever heard.

I am also one of the few who actually prefers the original theatrical release with Harrison Ford's voice-over, which virtually everyone else hates.

I love a good sci-fi flick even if it is not a huge budget blockbuster like I Robot, etc. And even though I am no sci-fi book buff, I did read Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' and loved it, own the Mark Waid graphic novel adaptation of it. Having never seen this movie that was loosely based on it, I thought I was sure to enjoy this.

Wrong. First of all, the dialogue failed in so many ways that the book succeeds - in making you sympathize with Androids wishing for autonomy and struggling to pass themselves off as human, for bounty hunter Deckard and his internal conflicts of ""retiring"" these rogue androids, and even the devastating effects of radiation on Earth and its cities that are marching forward into an essentially hopeless future, etc etc. It just falls flat without good dialogue or narraration.

I can forgive the 1982 special effects of course, it was not bad for the time. I can also forgive how the trajactory of the story is different without certain elements they decided to omit altogether, like the religious of Mercerism that many adhere to and was significant in the book's storyline, the practice highlighted in the book of owning animals to preserve some humanity or avoid social stigma, etc. Overall though, for me the movie was a depressing, bleak (but without much context), and creepy attempt at honoring a fantastic sci-fi novel.",1376524800,5,1423,4.688

To be fair, I didn't watch this in the 80's even though I was a teenager during that time. I didn't actually watch this until just last month so it probably suffered some in my rating as it is very dated.  But I simply couldn't find myself invested in any of the characters in this movie.  I didn't care if Decker was a replicant, because I didn't care about Decker.  You never see anything about him that makes you want to care.

Make no mistake, this is every fan's dream because it is loaded with extras. I have the 4-Disc Collector's Edition though many others have since been released on Blu-Ray and DVD. Harrison Ford was even included (but there was little mention of his dislike of Ridley Scott or the film though). It's one of the best behind-the-scenes documentaries I have ever watched (it reminded me of the excellent Never Sleep Again documentary on A Nightmare on Elm Street). Almost all of the main cast, crew and producers have returned to tell their stories. They talk about casting, shooting, editing, financing and everything else Blade Runner. If you were living in the dark ages with an old DVD or VHS copy of this you will love the deluxe treatment Blade Runner received with this upgrade.

The movie itself is one of the greatest science fiction films of all-time. A police officer comes out of retirement to track down some illegal replicants (human cyborgs) who look like humans but are much stronger and at least as intelligent. Harrison Ford stars as Deckard who is trying to find his own humanity. It is stylistically similar to film noir (think 1940s) so that is not to everyone's taste (this is not Star Wars). I have shown this film to many people and few get it. Almost no one gets it the first time but this gets better with each repeat viewing. It also boasts an excellent original story from the legendary Hugo award winner, Philip K. Dick. Blade Runner was adapted from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by PKD.

I had read the book before watching the movie (I try not to compare, because I feel books and movies should be judged in their own right), and it was much more interesting to me than the movie. I think the internal struggle of the characters and some of the things that got left out of the movie (which I understand, as it would have been awkward to fit it in smoothly without making the movie quite long), really contribute to the story, and I was sucked in right away. The movie's definitely worth a watch, but it's not a fast-paced action sci fi, and I definitely recommend reading the book (maybe after the movie? Not sure it matters, really).

Because of the low quality of the hd conversion, the movie in turn looks very grainy and the contrast is not very good. DVDs are usually around 8-9 mbps this bluray is not much better.

How many versions of one film could you want?
The studio played with the 1982 US Theatrical Version editing the story and creating a ""happy ending"".
To complicate things, 1982 International Version, US cable and video version made a number of changes to the Theatrical Version.  This was very much the ""official version"" for many years.
The 1992 Director's Cut changed the film.  Much of the narration is gone, as is the ""happy ending"".  This film suggests a darker future and raises questions about the hero's humanity.  This was the preferred version.
RIDLEY SCOTT'S ALL-NEW ""FINAL CUT"" VERSION OF THE FILM is a completely re-master version with additional and extended scenes among other things.

107415,5,0790729628,"This review is for the 3-disc Blu-Ray 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition version.

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attacked ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhuser Gate. All those... moments... will be lost in time, like [cough] tears... in... rain. Unless, of course, I buy the DVD, in which case I can relive those moments. Again and  [cough] again.

Although deciding *which* moment to relive might be a problem. You see, there are at least seven versions of the Truth that I know of. While makes Blade Runner a transdimensional entity spanning a multitude of alternate universes, much like Khan Noonien Singh, since there is no way that Benedict Cumberbatch could sell a car in this timeline, even if it featured the thickly-cushioned luxury of seats made of fine Corinthian leather... but I... [cough] digress...

As I was saying, there is the International Cut (also known as Criterion Edition) from 1982, which was more violent than than the US theatrical release (What? Pris holds Deckard up by his *nostrils*? I've heard the expression ""to get your nose out of joint"" but this appears to be a very literary interpretation of the idiom). This version was released on VHS and on laserdisc (as the Criterion Collection). Second, there is the US theatrical version, also known as Original Version or the domestic cut, where Batty did *not* gouge Tyrells eyeballs out in an orgy of blood (as he did in the International version). There is also the workprint version which was shown only to a few folks as a preview, but which  was callously distributed in 1991 as the ""Director's Cut"" even though Ridley Scott did not  authorize it in any way. Then there is the 'official' Director's Cut, which *was* blessed by Ridley Scott, and released in 1992. Also Ridley Scott's Final Cut, was released in theaters and on DVD in 2007. And let's not forget the so-called ""San Diego sneak peek cut"", which was only shown once in 1982. And of course the various broadcast versions, which were edited predominantly to meet TV broadcast standards (so in many of these versions Deckard never asks asks Rachael about reading a magazine, and we never see her response, when she wants to know if Deckard is testing whether she is a replicant or a ... [cough]...)

So know the contents of the version you buy. The 3-disc Blu-Ray version includes the Final Cut (disc 1) US theatrical release, the International version, the 1992 directors cut (disc 2), and the rare Workprint release, a documentary (""Dangerous Days"") and a lot of cool stills from the movie (disc 3). It also includes pages sandwiched into the DVD case with some interesting artwork and photos.

Every one of them has offered something new over the previous releases, not always something major, but something that makes adding to the Blade Runner collection appealing. The films are the films, and are presented with amazing quality on Blu-ray. The collectibles are the draw for me at this point. As collectibles go, these are among the nicer offered by such Collector's Editions. Having a second spinner (the first from the Briefcase Edition) is a nice touch, and the additional artwork is revelatory. For fans of the film, including those who already have previous editions, this 30th Anniversary Edition is a worthy addition to your collection, especially at its currently reduced price. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1372809600,,772,5.184
107419,4,0790729628,"[Primarily a review of the Blu-ray itself]  Wow.  This is by far the most beautiful film transfer I've ever seen.  Ridley Scott says this is his favorite version of the film, and that they did a 4k transfer to digital, then transcoded to Blu Ray.  This means they transferred it at 4 times the resolution of your HD TV.  And it shows.  This may be, especially for us old timers - you know, born before Y2k - the best possible movie format:  film digitally beautified/restored and transferred to digital.  It's wonderful to behold.  One can see the graininess and warmth that film brings.  But with zero distortion and loss that comes from copying film to other media, like VHS.  It's some of the most spectacular film footage you will behold.  Watch it for this reason alone.  I really still cannot believe how utterly beautiful to behold this version is.

As for the ""Final Cut"" version of the film, it's been a long time since I've seen the theatrical and director's cut versions, but this version seems really good and close to the director's cut I think.  I'm pretty sure there are some new digital FX images put into the film - and though they are technically amazing I thought they were a bit too different from the original film footage.  Not a big deal, but to me feels less organic (can one use that phrase for a sci-fi film?).

Kudos to Ridley Scott and whatever powers that be that had the fortitude to make this release.",1372723200,,1432,4.53125
107420,5,0790729628,"I love Blade Runner, it's one of my favorite movies from one of my favorite directors. I will say, though, that the US theatrical cut isn't great. The voiceover is just unbearable, and it has a lot of the more violent scenes cut.
Good thing is, though, this box set comes with 5 different cuts of the movie AND the unfinished Workprint version. I'd highly recommend watching 2007's Final Cut, which removes the Deckard voiceover completely, along with a few other changes. Then you can go back and watch the other cuts in whichever order you'd like.

Definitely worth buying for any Ridley Scott or Blade Runner fans",1372723200,,616,4.703703703703703

It has been written and described that Harrison and the Director in particular disliked the narrated version.  I for one like that aspect in the right movies (see also Cannery Row or Last Man Standing) as it gives an added input to our viewing senses.  In Blade Runner the non-narrated versions It seems to me that there is not enough sound or dialogue to compensate for the lack of narration, or to support the story without the narration.

I love the `40s film noir atmosphere combined with the futuristic man-has-despoiled-the-planet setting; the way the story proceeds from clue to clue; the way the replicants' actions mirror the humans' actions; and the theme, that the humanoids are ""more human than human."" I prefer the theatrical version, with the voice-over and the flight scenes at the end. The longer version feels more complete and more rounded somehow. The so-called director's cut seems thin after seeing the other. This is always a great movie, in any version.

 So why 4 stars you ask? Its because of the packaging, The DVD box is 5-1/2 x 7. The box it was shipped in is 7 x 10. The shipping box had no packing material around the inner box so the DVD box can slide around during shipping. Mine did and it caused crushing to the upper left corner of the box.

107478,5,0790729628,"Just finished watching Final Cut. What I can say, well I will say. Unbelievable.
This movie was brilliantly done and amazing in HD. Buy it. But I have a few philosophical thoughts so stop reading here if you are not interested or perhaps watch the movie first.

I first watched this as a kid and thought it was great in a Sci-Fi kinda way. My brother and I use to run about quoting. ""Its too bad she won't live. But then again who does?"" I think we understood it then. But not within the context that under pins the entire movie.

Today, I found deep subtleties that were quite haunting. What is life and is anything retained after we're gone? Or are our memories and experiences just like ""...tear drops in rain"".

The death of Zhora was quite emotional and I now understand why it was suppose to be.

I'm not sure if it was done deliberately or my current state of mind (I'll admit to that), but you come to understand the true philosophical context of this work, which perhaps comes out more so in ""The Final Cut"" version.

Finally the question of Deckard and the answer (or no answer) reveals itself to be - irrelevent. This movie projects out the ""Ultimate Question"" onto the ""Skin Jobs"" as a pseudo representation of ourselves. The quest of ""...More life"" and the ""...itch you can never scratch"" as the knowing of what its like to ""...live in fear"" of it ultimately coming to an end sooner than you would like.

""Thats what it is to be a slave""

Regardless of culture, religion or ethnicity - it doesn't matter. Live life, cherish life and cherish the life of all people (and pigeons). As there are no guarantees only delusions. As the deluded conclude that they are better, smarter, superior and more worthly of life - effecting the deemed less worthly into a desperate fight or flight for survival. The aware will admit to know nothing and given the choice - will save life.

Watch this movie and you will see what I mean.",1370995200,,1930,4.478632478632479

Blade Runner looks so good though! It could have been made in the last decade. I was astounded by how much tiny set detail was visible on Blu-Ray.

You may love the movie, the characters, music, storyline, mood, photography, and directing as much as I and other friends and family do, but you do not have an obligation to buy into the ending of the director's cut. The director made that choice.
Buy this film. Use it for discussions of the many ideas expressed, enjoy it, be saddened by it, be moved deeply by its messages. All the while, remember, while the director is talented and gifted in many ways, his alternative ending isn't The True One, or the 'right' one; his alternative ending is HIS interpretation. It isn't even the one the author wrote.
All of us have the freedom and obligation to use our imaginations, make interpretations, and utilize the subjects raised in a movie, book, or short story.

There have been some enhancements to the visuals but they fit right in to the original. That says a lot about the 1982 classic...you can add CGI and it fits perfectly.

I argue that this is Harrison Ford's best role (yes geeks, I know he was Han Solo and Indiana Jones). His acting is great and he plays this kind of futuristic film noir detective/assassin perfectly.

There is very little change to the story in this version from the directors cut but there are a couple dialog changes and a few extended shots.  All in all, this version is pretty much the same as the directors cut but with much better visuals.  The Tyrel Building looks absolutely amazing as the cars fly by.  It is noticeable and anyone who is a fan of this movie will notice it immediately.

Maybe not as good as Scott's previous Alien, but still one of those film classics that you only experience maybe a dozen times in your life. The special effects along with Vangelis's extraordinary score and Ridley Scott's impecable craftsmanship made this film a true wonder to behold. It still holds up to the test of time, but not quite as well as a few other films I can think of that are considered sci-fi classics. There was a time when I would have argued the opinion that this movie was an undeniable masterpiece, and maybe it was then, now I am still convinced it is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Maybe not quite a masterpiece, but it still get's very close to that. I think anyone who see's this movie and hates it doesn't know what good classic cinema is really all about. And it can be argued that this movie is one of the best science fiction movies ever made and the impression would be greatly resonated by millions of fans. I think the final cut is the best cut. It looked and sounded splendid, so I agree with Ridley Scott on this point. If you love sci-fi or even classic hollywood blockbusters, you'd be hard pressed to find a better and more engaging film to pass the time with.

While there is some film grain in certain scenes, it is soft rather than gritty.  It did not call attention to iself.

107596,4,0790729628,"I actually had to watch this film for a class on Science Fiction Films of the 20th Century, and I had also just read the source stroy ""Do Androids Dream if Electric Sheep?"" I truly ejoyed the film and the story, but the two are vastly different. People who are looking for a faithful retelling of the novel, look elsewhere. The film uses some of the basic concepts of the novel, but overall it seems to be much more of a ""inspired by..."" rather than a ""based on."" The film is dark, both in tone and in look. I found the acting great, especially Ford, Hauer, and Sean Young. One of the reasons I had to view this film for class was to examine it as an example of Tech Noir, (a term coined by James Cameron in the Terminator film a few years later, but which can easily be retroactivly applied to this film,) and it truly is an exemplar of the genre. In this version, the voice-over narration has been removed, as has the ""happy ending"" shot of Decker and Rachel driving through the countryside, and Decker's unicorn dream sequence has been left in. All in all, I agree with these choices, as I believe they are closer to what Scott intended. Some have said that the film is slow and tough to understand. Perhaps it was because I was familiar with the novel, but I did not find it to be too dense of difficult to follow, and the acting is so good and each shot is so interesting visually, that I never thought that the film lagged at all. I steamed this on my computer, but I am really considering picking this up on Blu-Ray, (if available.)",1366156800,2,1539,4.292096219931271

All I have to say is that the essential plot is an ancient one in films, but that is not a criticism. There are some nice views and many devices from, what would they call it, the age of noir? I could just see Mike Mazurki going into the saloon where Velma used to work (with Dick Powell whom he had just hired to find her) and tossing the bartender who came to stop him into eternity. Of course, Charlton Heston took a sci-fi shot at getting rid of the not wanteds, and........Nevertheless it was entertaining to see Harrison Ford at work although yet another scene on the roofs didn't exactly have the thrills it should have had as  the final confrontation (remember Edward G. Robinson and Orson Welles in the bell tower of a church and...............). So, as one who never had seen nor even known the film existed, all I can say to those others who  will know nothing about it save that it stars Harrison Ford, is that it is worth the slight cost of a used copy for it will give you a couple of hours of shoot-em-up, chasin'  'em down, and battered PI to enliven the evening.

And its cult status still preceeds it even after all these years, and that is the makings of a true classic. The cast is an arrangement of some of the best actors to date, their interaction with eachother in the film is simply poetry.

Philip K. Dick was one of the brightest and darkly satirical as well as amusing writers in his field. He shows the persistence of humanity as well as the persistence of both the evils of money and power.

When it comes to remastered BDs, this is as good as it gets. Video: 10+ Audio: 10+ Extras: 10+

Wondering whether this is as good as the 5 disc Collector's Edition? YES!! It contains all 4 versions of the film plus the RARE ""Work Print Feature version."" Most important of all, it contains the 3 1/2 hour documentary ""Dangerous Days"" on the EXTRAS disc. A rare piece of cinema heritage & history. With all the controversy surrounding this CLASSIC, it's a wonder it was made at all.

Packaged in a thick glossy cardboard book holder. The pages include some production art & photos. (See Amazon pics.) I would have preferred the original One Sheet poster art on the cover, but oh well. (I own the original 1982 One Sheet, which is priceless to me!) It will fit nicely on the shelf alongside your other BDs. The info on the discs is a little hard to read, but you'll manage.

DISC ONE: BD 2007 The Final Cut

DISC TWO: BD 1982 Original Theatrical Cut (with the controversial voice-over narration. I was lucky enough to have seen this on the widescreen back in the day), 1982 International Cut (with voice-over & added gore. The 1st version available on VHS for home viewing and the version most hardcore fans are familiar with), 1991 Director's Cut.

DISC THREE: BD Special Features. Workprint Feature. ""Dangerous Days"" documentary & more.

107752,5,0790729628,"In 2019, the Tyrell Corporation has manufactured organic robots identical to humans called ""replicants"", which are used as slave labor on off-world colonies. If a replicant disobeys and returns to Earth, a Blade Runner hunts them down and ""retires"" them- in other words, executes them. This story follows Deckard (Harrison Ford), a retired Blade Runner, who agrees to hunt down four violent replicant that have escaped into Los Angeles. Blade Runner is a mesmerizing and thought-provoking SciFi film.

I really enjoyed the story in Blade Runner; it's a story that doesn't have to rely on action. Although it may sound like a chase film, it's much more than a typical SciFi action flick; it uses it's visuals, dialogue, and action to create a deeper experience. The film uses hypnotizing music, and stunning visuals to create an eerie-like atmosphere- it places you into a thinking mood. There are many versions of this film, some more thought-provoking than others; I say this because the film can generally be perceived in many ways, especially the ending. I recommend watching this film multiple times, starting with the International version then the Final Cut. The pacing is a bit slow, the acting is great, the music is amazing, and the visuals are breathtaking.

I own the 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-Ray). The first disc has the Final Cut; The second disc has the Theatrical Cut, the International Cut, and the Director's Cut; the third disc has the Workprint Version and the special features. All of the discs are Blu-Ray, no DVDs. The picture quality has been upgraded significantly and the film looks phenomenal, matching most modern films; this is definitely one of the best upgrades I've seen and I hope more classic films get this treatment.

Overall, Blade Runner is an amazing SciFi film, with an extremely immersive SciFi atmosphere, stunning cinematography, mesmerizing music, and a deep storyline (depending on your perception, of course). I highly recommend the 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-Ray) for fans and first-time viewers, because it is the definitive version and has all of the versions of the film- the slightest differences can really change your opinion.

The presentation is nice, small hardcovr book with every version of the movie you can think of with a really nice amount of extras. The artwork in the book is great as well. I have another version of this, and may get this copy in order to get the book itself, great for collecting or for  a conversation piece. I have been getting more blu ray book versions and this one looks great (packaging) and is a must have for any die hard sci fi fans. For literary buffs, although it's based on the Philip K. Dick novel, ""do androids dream of electronic sheep"" there is a huge huge deviation from the book. So do not prejudge and simply appreciate it for what it is, the movie story line though is compelling There is a lot more depth added as well and so much additional scenes as it's only based on a short story not a full novel. So purists beware. the next part is a spoiler in case u haven't seen it yet. One point of contention betwe4en Harrison Ford and Ridley scott was the ""unicorn dream"" and how it was suppposed to make us think he is a replicant. Ford says it's better for him to be human, while Ridley seemed to like the ambiguity that it implies. I for one never found the unicorn dream to mean anything. It just seems like  something any man might dream about in a future where animals are priceless commodities. There is the telling of how he wanted an animal for himself but couldn't afford it. so the dream to me didn't imply too much. Maybe cause I am thinking of it in more of a literary sense and not so much as a standalone movie.

My favorite is the original with narration.

For fans, I recommend this. All the detail is there in blu ray. The cut scenes in themselves add so much to the background story and a new depth. Ridley sure shot a lot of takes that are not used.

Once I started watching, I had to keep going into the exteas as this brought back do much memories. This still holds up to anything made today.",1356048000,,665,4.147286821705427

I remember years back when the briefcase was released and always meant to pick it up, but then blu rays became dominant and I'm happy that I held out for this version.

First, you get all versions of the movie. I was concerned that if I didn't buy the super-deluxe version that I would miss out on some of the versions. I worried unnecessarily as the theatrical, international, director's, and final cut are all included.

What's the 4th disc on the super-deluxe version, then? It's the DVD of the final cut, so unless you're a slow adopter you're getting everything in the 3 disc option. Right now it's about a $30 difference, all for a different box, a model car, and a DVD.

Look to other reviews if you're looking for specific ratios or values, but I will say that I watched this with a few uninterested friends who were wowed when they saw the movie for the first time. They couldn't believe that a movie this old could look that good.

Result: a fine purchase that will keep me busy looking through the plethora of extras. Not necessarily for the collector, it's truly a superior experience.",1356048000,5,1175,4.576190476190476

107948,5,0790729628,"""Blade Runner"" is not a movie to watch lightly.  And one cannot digest this entire set in one sitting.  It would be redundant.  Yet it is such a fascinating movie that is worthy of study.  This edition has just about every cut imaginable, including the ""work print"", so the serious fan will have enough to chew on for weeks!  My personal favorite is The Final Cut, though I do reserve a certain fondness for the original theatrical release.  The documentaries and interviews are comprehensive and  well-done.  I cannot praise the thoroughness of this compilation highly enough, though perhaps that may also be the one point I could criticize:  there is an awful lot of material, and not all of it would be of interest to everybody.  I found myself wandering and nodding off at times.

Nevertheless, it's just about ALL THERE!  For uber-fans, this is a must!  (Though I kind of wish I had the Final Cut on Blu-Ray...)  Don't forget to just enjoy the movie after all of the ""study"".  It's a classic for a reason!",1355356800,,1010,4.627118644067797

I mean $5 lb for BACON???? - and to whom I also direct a well earned, ""KUDOS!"".  Your reviews were knowledgeable & heartfelt, as befits this work. A film that's SO MUCH MORE than ""just"" a film!  The philosophical, ecological, ethical, theological and political questions raised by BR make it one of my personal TOP 10 FILMS OF ALL TIME; which is as close as my mercurial personality allows me to come in naming any work BEST above all others.  Both as an artist (I'm a musician) and a fan, BR hits ALL the right buttons, what's more, in those spots where I'm left wanting; desperate for answers I'm not given, I realize this is by design.  In a conspiracy between writers Philip K. Dick, Fancher, et al & Director Ridley Scott and his actors, I'm forced to LEARN TO FISH; because they're not handing out any fish dinners.  This comment though, leads me to pinpoint the single flaw I note in the reviews that have gone before.  To wit, no credit given to the IMPRESSIVE work done by secondary cast members; the ""below the title"" players who make movies possible.  I'd therefore like to call to your attention 3 PERFORMANCES - though, there were very few, if any, less-than-stellar performances ...
Edward James Olmos / Gaff; an actor who later made hay with another SciFi character, Adm Wm Adama, Olmos brought just the proper amounts of gravitas and street trash to his bright-eyed 'bad' good guy role;
William Sanderson / J.F. Sebastian; with credits literally too numerous to mention, an undergrad degree & Juris Doctorate, Sanderson is as much a thinking man as he is a thinking man's actor!
Lastly, a performance almost universally overlooked & (IMHO) under-appreciated, that of 'pleasure girl', Pris:
Darryl Hannah; setting herself up to be invited inside with more panache than most centenarian vampires, young Pris gives the impression she's in her element, as much when she schmoozes Sebastian as when she tries to 'off' Deckard.  Again IMHO, this is a phenomenally nuanced performance and what's really incredible about it, is that it doesn't seem incredible - because the bar for acting is set SO HIGH, then continuously bested by this cast.

107997,5,0790729628,"What no one has answered is what is different about this ""30th Anniversary"" edition blu-ray that the previous blu-ray edition from 2007?

Is there any noticeable difference in image or sound quality at all?

Fans are acting as if this is the very first time that Blade Runner has appeared in high-def blu-ray and that's not the case. Has everyone forgotten the previous five-disk 2007 release that also contained the so-called ""final"" cut?

First of all, I doubt that Ridley Scott can keeps his hands off this film, and that more final-final-this time I really REALLY mean it versions will come out in the future.

Secondly, I never for a second bought into the lame idea that Harrison Ford's character is a robot. Even if the androids THINK they experience memories (implanted from real human donors), the idea that they can love each other is absurd. I always read the film to say that Deckard is a living flesh & blood human being like you and I.

Thirdly, the best version of this film by far was the original theatrical release with the Harrison Ford narration. Ford's narration is vital to the story, as this plot is rather vague and hard to follow at times. Any newer versions that try to establish some lame sort of ambiguity towards the main protagonist is just a cheap gimick to make suckers spend more money on new ""versions"".

Lastly, Ridley Scott's lost his touch. Compare this masterpiece to his most recent ""Prometheus"", a very tired formulaic film that sadly tries to capitalize on his monumental 1979 original ""Alien"" movie's coattails. Lets just say that I no longer trust the director's artistic whims. Leave your classic films alone, Mr Scott, because like George Lucas, you're just ripping off your fans at this point.

Lets see less new re-versioning of this classic, shall we. All I want is the best image and sound quality available of the original film. Is this that? Is this version better than the 2007 five-disk blu-ray package at all, or are fans being ripped off?",1353801600,2,1993,4.759420289855073

However, the big problem, and why I didn't give this package 5 stars, is the UltraViolet version. In the past, when I've bought UltraViolet movies, I was able to download it through iTunes. Which let me play it on iPad, iPhone, iEverything. Inception, Big Lebowski, all the Lord of the Rings, and others I'm forget are all in my iTunes library.

Now, the UltraViolet copy requires some goofy, third party, that uses Adobe Air which is required to play this on your one laptop/desktop. And you have to have accounts at Flixster and UltraViolet.

I'm sure I can rip the movie to a local file, given all the media I have with this set (multiple BDs, and 1 DVD) but I don't want to. I just want to download and go. I want convenience.

108040,5,0790729628,"Watching ""Blade Runner"" is an emotional investment no matter how many times you see it. I don't know if it's the lighting, the music, the dialogue, or a combination of all of the above. How a science fiction film from 1982 can still have that effect on me after seeing it dozens of times is beyond my comprehension. I always come away from the film with my insides all mixed together with sadness, excitement, and that warm feeling of happy nostalgia you get when you experience something you never thought you could again.

Thanks to Warner Bros. Home Entertainment's release of ""Blade Runner: The 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition,"" science fiction fans can view any one of five different versions of the film whenever they want in the comfort of their own home theater. You can choose from ""The Final Cut,"" the ""Original Theatrical Cut,"" the ""International Theatrical Cut,"" the ""Director's Cut,"" or the ""Rare Workprint Feature Version.""

No matter what version of the movie you watch, they all tell the same story. In the year 2019, a group of organic robots called replicants kill a ship full of people while escaping an interstellar trip and head to Earth. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is hired to hunt the fugitives down and destroy them. Deckard is what is referred to as a ""blade runner"" - a special police officer that ""retires"" replicants when they wander back to Earth where they've been banned.

I've seen ""Blade Runner"" in many different environments and formats. I've seen it on VHS on a 25-inch television. I had the opportunity to see it on the big-screen a couple of times at revival screenings. I've watched it on a 50-inch flat screen in a regular DVD format. I can wholeheartedly tell you that if you haven't seen this amazing piece of cinema history on Blu-ray in its restored ""Final Cut"" version then you've never properly viewed it.

Each version of the film has something different to add to its viewing experience. There are different endings, additional footage, and even a monologue by Harrison Ford that tells you everything you need to know (and many fans would say some things you shouldn't) to help explain what's happening throughout. I suggest watching every version of the film to truly appreciate and take it all in.

Douglas Trumball's special visual effects are a step beyond stunning. The use of models and practical effects gives ""Blade Runner"" a realistic look that filmmakers today using CGI only wish they could achieve. Everything from the architecture of the buildings to the designs of the vehicles still influences designers to this day.

""The Final Cut"" is breathtaking to look at in high-definition. I've never seen the movie look so pure. Yet somehow it still has that nostalgic grainy element that only real film can provide. The last time I remember feeling this satisfied with a high-definition transfer was when I saw the Blu-ray version of ""Jaws"" for the first time. The 5.1 surround sound mix gives viewers everything they could ever want by immersing them in an excellent musical score by Vangelis mixed with sonic treats like the blips and beeps of communicators, the engines of hover crafts and cars, and the chaotic noises of the futuristic city.

Special features included in this edition include the 211-minute ""Dangerous Days"" documentary, ""All Our Variant Futures: From Workprint to Final Cuts"" documentary, HD stills, and more than 1,000 archival images. There are also introductions to the different versions by director Ridley Scott and audio commentary by various people. Let's just say there's enough material to easily pack four discs.

We also get an exclusive hardcover art book full of behind-the scenes photos, production art, sketches, and storyboards. Let's not forget the lenticular mini-poster and Concept Spinner model included in the box set. ""Blade Runner: The 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" truly is the gift that keeps on giving.

There's no possibly way any hardcore devotee of ""Blade Runner"" could be disappointed in this new edition of the cult film. It's an exhaustive collection of every version of the movie combined with hours of behind-the-scenes and making of features to give special insight into the construction of this cinematic treasure. It's an absolute must-have item to complete any science fiction buff's library of essential movies.",1352851200,,4343,5.054469273743017

I recently watched this classic science fiction piece of work, well the Final Cut version... so far. My impressions are mind blowing. Every version of the film I watched prior always looks grainy (might not be the best descriptive), dark (crushing so), and a movie that simply showed its age. Not so anymore. The Final Cut is a blazing transfer. As so many well done transfers do, it looks like a new movie with deep blacks and bright pops (where appropriate). Some scene have been enhanced but nothing to get bent out of shape over. This is, as Ridley himself states, the version of the film he likes best. I agree whole heartily. Surround sound is also excellent, and I believe a new mix (probably new from the older BD release).

It all depends on how much you want the lenticular, art/archive book and the miniature Spinner, and also how big of a die hard Blade Runner fan you are. I had some amazon gift cards, so I got this for $35. I feel that that is a fair value. I probably would not have purchased this if I had to cash out $60. I would have just sticked to the Director's Cut. Luckily that's not that case though I guess!

No Gimmicky packaging or toy cars.

Here you have the versions of the film that really matter, featuring ""The Final Cut"" which is by far my favorite version of the film. The picture quality on this Blu Ray transfer is mind blowing. You would think this film was made within the last 5 years if you didn't know any better. The amount of content on these discs is perfect with out being overkill, plus tons of bonus material.

Also, I finally feel that the film has gotten the packaging it deserves with this release. The artwork in the book is great, and I love the cover art of the origami unicorn....a beautiful image that hauntingly represents the movie. This is much better than those character montage covers.

108092,4,0790729628,"""Blade Runner"" is the type of film that people seem to either love or hate.  There are those who, like myself, initially did not care for it but later came to like it very much.  Categorically this is a sort of a film-noir detective story set in the near future (2019).  When the film was first released in 1982 it would have been considered fairly far in the future -- 39 years.  The film has a very different style and effect than films such as Star Wars, Star Trek or even Alien which, like this one, was directed by Ridley Scott.  Blade Runner may well come to be seen as being Scott's masterpiece if it isn't already.  There are a few flaws and anachronisms here and there.  A building in the  futuristic city has the ""Pan Am"" logo.  Neon displays, which have already mostly disappeared, are seen in store displays along with CRT type televisions, also largely gone now. Coca-Cola signs, as expected, seem to be displayed practically everywhere.

Leonard Maltin gives this film a very negative rating in his annual movie book and I, at first, agreed with him.  But subsequent viewings slowly began to change my mind.  It must be said that the first DVD issue of this film was technically terrible.  The color red was misconverged putting practically everything a little out of focus.  This Blu-ray 5-disc issue put that and practically everything else right.  The ""Final Cut"" version displays the truly remarkable cinematography and sound recording of this film.  Some of the shots of Sean Young are truly mesmerizing.  In fact the film as a whole in its visual and audible aspects has a sort of hypnotic effect unlike any other film of its type.  Especially effective is the superb score by Vangelis which adds great atmosphere to the visual aspects of the film.

I won't go into the complexities of the plot as to whom is and whom is not an android -- in this movie referred to as a ""replicant.""  In addition, the ending of the story was altered by the producers which in itself set off a storm of discussion by fans of the film.  Also, a narration provided in the first person by Harrison Ford in the 1982 version(s) of the film was deleted in the 1992 ""Director's Cut"" and ""Final Cut.""  All versions of the film are provided in this extensive set so no one should be disappointed.  This is a very comprehensive and meticulously produced collection.

108136,5,0790729628,"30th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray Review:

Having seen this movie probably more times and in more different formats than most, I thought it was time I write a few words about this masterpiece of filmmaking. Truly, I wasn't boasting with my assertion that I've seen this movie as much as I have (I watch this movie almost once a week and have done so for well over 10 years). I own several, still unopened, VHS tapes that for a large part of the nineties I did my best at collecting. I own the Japanese Laserdisc version, a rare bootleg VHS version that was distributed over the internet a handful of years ago that has the narration selectively placed back into the Director's Cut version of the film, not called the Esper Version as some would want to label it, the Director's Cut and now the HD version of the Final Cut. Blade Runner is just one of those movies that *consistently* holds up to numerous viewings and is never dull. Only the finest films seem to have this quality.

Blade Runner first and foremost, is probably the greatest film ever made, from beginning to end and in all of its variations. A bold statement when the film doesn't even rank in the top 10 in the American Film Institute or on IMDb. Spots #97 and #104 respectively (ahem). But as these kind of lists are subjective and truly under the control of mere mortals and their own strange whims, and I take no offense that so many so-called aficionados have over-looked this film for so long. Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that 'Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film. We saw this same knee-jerk reaction to something mentally and emotionally foreign happen again with Prometheus, but that's another tale, but not unexpected.

For years, Blade Runner was divided into two different camps, or rather four and they are: Those that preferred the narration and those that did not. The other camp were those that thought Deckard was a Replicant and those that thought he was either human or felt it was left ambiguous. Ridley Scott has very gracefully over the years, given homage to these thoughts and made many statements that most readers are aware of, chiefly - that Deckard was a Replicant. Unfortunately, the studios messed with the film during post-production in a very ham-handed manner. Warner Brothers had the right to trim anything after the 120 min mark, and thus butchering the nuance of the film and leaving several things vague and forcing Scott to tack on the 'happy ending' and the narration - because as we all know ... we're all just too stupid to get it. The Unicorn sequence and several other moments in the film were made to direct our attention down one path, but that path was obscured. Hampton Fancher, bless him, was one of those people who rejected the idea of Deckard being a Replicant. But that's okay, everyone has the right to their own interpretation. Philip K. Dick, however, was a little less fuzzy about it though. Deckard *was* a Replicant, and he had stated as much.

The new and most refreshing part of the new argument, evinced in the 210 (wow!) min documentary 'Dangerous Days' is that Scott gives equal time to those that enjoyed the film with the narration, with Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth / Hellboy) in the forefront, with his very candid telling of how Blade Runner changed his life and launched him down the road into filmmaking. We also get to hear a very lucid and warm retelling from Harrison Ford, and the nightmare that he not only endured making the movie but the further commitment of having to do the Voice Over narration months later. That ended up having its own strange story as well. We never really get to discover who that person was who wrote the Voice Over narration, because it *wasn't* David Peoples and it *wasn't* Hampton Fancher.

This newer version (2012) comes equipped with over a thousand still photos, a spinner car model and a 72 page booklet (or digibook). I've also read, elsewhere, that it comes with a lenticular film cell but I think they should've also included one of the many versions of the soundtrack that's available as well. Some of die-hard fans would've preferred that . There's honestly not much in difference from the 2007 Final Cut release, which honestly, should've been the final release. Ultra-violet copy? I guess. But I prefer the actual disc so I can see this thing without hour-glassing, or visual generation loss from streaming. Yes, here comes the arguments in favor of Ultra-Violet.

The 2012 Packaging with the Unicorn on the front: I think we can safely surmise that this is, once again, Ridley Scott underlining his position about Deckard. Of all the many elements to call attention to or feature on the cover, this one here is probably the most emblematic in regards 'who made who.' After all, if you know enough about this film, you already are aware that the only humans in this film were Sebastian, Holden, Gaff, Chew and Bryant. Every one else -- Replicants. Eldon Tyrell -- Replicant.

But for the record -- there has been no adjustment made to the previous release of The Final Cut from 2007 in terms of the feature film itself. None. New menu? Maybe, but that doesn't affect the film. The film itself is the same. Why Amazon is allowing a whole new set of reviews for this product is beyond me. They should grouped them with the last set.

So, now with several versions available in this box set, and with several others, you get to see Blade Runner in every single angle imaginable and it is engrossing every time. Ebert also said in the Nineties that the re-release of the movie for the Director's Cut gives you yet another version of the film, but fails to handle the main problems that were so apparent the first time around. As the film has changed, Ebert has gone from student flippancy to utmost respect and enjoyment. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time if you're interested. I'm doubting he'll review the film again, as nothing with the film itself has changed for the 2012 release.

There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Blade Runner is probably the high water mark of all films and will probably stay that way for quite some time. Internet voting puts the film as the 4th greatest movie of all time, according to AFI's own user polls - so that really puts perspective on AFI's and IMDb's so-called Final Lists. There's even a restored scene where they had lost the negative and had to reshoot it. Yes, they rebuilt the set and put everything back as it was. Harrison Ford's son was the same age when they did this and almost a dead ringer for his dad and was used as a stand in. The scene where Deckard confronts the snake seller and we see him pull him forward by his tie -- that's actually his son, Ben Ford, doing the man-handling.

The funny thing is about this film, and it strikes me every time when I watch it -- usually when I hear that 'Ladd Comapny Logo' sound -- is that there isn't another film like this or even close to it that has come out since this was in the theatres. It's singular in many ways, even in its own duplicitous nature. Wim Wender's 'Until The End of The World' does have a sort of kin-ship with this, but it has a different feel and completely different message. I think it may be 'equally bold' though. So, the absence of anything similar is really a testament to how good it really is. A lot of folks bring up 'Children of Men' and the nuance of that film, which was brilliant. But an equal? I don't know.

All I can really do is thank Ridley Scott for so much bloody effort, the sacrifice of years and such a true masterpiece; but I doubt he's even aware of how much I've gotten from Blade Runner or even who I am. His answer to fans is to just keep making more films. Of that, I'm thankful and will keep watching this for years to come.

My son, who's now 5, has already seen this countless times and knows what it is when it comes on. Will he ever do 'Blade Runner' Sundays, like we did at the house with Casablanca for 12 plus years? Don't know, but it would cool if he does. I was told by the wife that I could only watch this on days when she was at work, which was fine.

On a final note, when people watch this film, a lot of people come away with a strange feeling of familiarity regarding the content, the story and the character of Rick Deckard the protagonist, the Detective, the Blade Runner. You should know that Philip K. Dick was an incredibly huge fan of Raymond Chandler and absorbed every one of his stories on a personal level. Hampton Fancher, the screenwriter was privy to this when he penned the screenplay while making the adaptation for 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and did his best to not only pay homage to this for Dick but for Chandler as well. Hampton Fancher stated that he actually wrote the screenplay with Robert Mitchum in mind for the part of Deckard. Watching films like `The Big Sleep' really bring it home and make it evident to the viewer. Chandler's 'The High Window' also seems to have a lot of interesting similarity to it as well.

Rachael: ""Do you like our owl?""

Deckard: ""Is it artificial?""

Rachael: ""Of course.""

Deckard: ""Must be expensive.""

Rachael: ""Very.""

As a parting thought, we might think that this is actually the final release of the film, but while I was watching the 'Dangerous Days' Documentary once again, I focused in on a comment that David Peoples made.  He said that there was a four-hour version (yes, 4 hours long) that they screened when they first put the thing together. I think at some point, we'll likely see that released next. Sooner rather than later is all I could say.

108165,3,0790729628,"Blade Runner (1982), based on ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Philip Dick, is a disappointing film.  Its superior premise, production design and talent would all lead one to expect a masterpiece, a worthy follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, Alien.  Even the movie poster artwork promises a dangerous, thought-provoking, and exciting dystopia film.  But Blade Runner doesn't capitalize on its many assets; it stagnates, rather than reaching its full potential.

Simply put, it doesn't go anywhere.  Harrison Ford himself recognized this when he commented that the film's plot was centered around a man's relationship with his toaster.  The script doesn't climax; it travels in a straight line.  When Roy Batty delivers his excellent ""tears in rain"" monologue at the end, the effect is not what it ought to be because the story has not meant anything up to that point.  There are many excellent scenes that have beauty and meaning throughout the film.  Some of them are very successful on a primal level, such as the love scene between Harrison Ford and Sean Young.  Others are effective at evoking a specific mood, such as the nightclub scene near the middle of the picture, and the many shots of Deckard walking through the dark, nightmarish city.  The point is that a string of scenes in row can all be individually brilliant, but they are meaningless as a whole unless they have something to tie them together beyond actors, cinematography, and basic premise.  Blade Runner needs a real story, a compelling story.  And that is the one component that this film lacks.

Blade Runner, however, remains an enjoyable film after multiple viewings.  Many viewers have reported hating the film the first time that they watched it, but as they watch it again and again, it begins to grow upon them until they finally begin to love it.  I, perhaps, can count myself in this category.  I was supremely disappointed after the first viewing, but after seeing the movie multiple times, I knew where the plot was going and rather than feeling disappointed, I was free to concentrate on the assets of the film: the beautiful cinematography, the production design, the music, and the overall mood that has been evoked.  In fact, Blade Runner has so many assets and so much potential that it is all the more painful that something as fundamental as the script held it back from becoming a masterpiece of the genre.  Nonetheless, Blade Runner remains an important film, and its influence in the science-fiction genre is indisputable.",1341446400,2,2532,4.971496437054632

I know, the format is long dead, but HD DVDs are still pretty cool!
I mean the resolution is AS GOOD as Blu-ray, sound ALMOST AS GOOD, and features are pretty much the same as the Blu-ray version. And this item is 3 times cheaper to buy than the Blu-ray! I'm sorry, i just have an affinity for products with style and integrity. ;)

So anyway, i bought this great item for around $12, and it is one of the most satisfying purchases i've ever received. All 5 versions of the film are in 1080P!
Even the rare Workprint! -Which i think is the best variant due to certain audio alterations, more time in the flying spinner police vehicles, less music, more street speak from Gaff, and some never before seen shots of the first Bladerunner shown in the film: Holden, albeit he is laid up in a life support vessel while Dekard cracks wize.. :p

The real treat for anyone who actually has the Toshiba HD DVD player or Xbox 360 extension drive, is most definitely The Final Cut.
This excellent transfer was scanned at over 4 times normal RES from the original film source, so only The Final Cut is truly worthy of competing with Blu-ray.

At least it has the little Matchbox-style Spinner included.

If you're a die-hard fan of BLADE RUNNER and really want the best picture/sound quality that is currently available, this might not be a bad price, since I'm sure that previous Blu-Ray sets of this are selling for a lot more with it being out of print. If not, then this is pretty easily skippable. The 5-Disc set has a glut of bonus features and four different versions of the film: The ""Final"" cut, the 1992 Director's Cut, the 1982 Theatrical Cut, and an early cut of the theatrical release. The fifth disc is an amazing 3-and-a-half hour behind-the-scenes documentary called ""Dangerous Days"" (a reference to the original working title for the film as scripted by Hampton Fancher) which is LOADED with interesting tidbits and anecdotes about the making of the film as well as long studies of its conceptual art to its continuing influence on Sci-Fi and neo-noir genres. Having watched only the Final cut (to see what significant changes were made from the '92 Director's cut, and there aren't many) and the Theatrical cut (because there are moments in the Theatrical cut that are really interesting as well) and the documentary, there's a lot to digest and again, is only for really hardcore fans of this film.

I know that everybody HATES UltraViolet because of the issues they have with streaming the film on the various devices it's supposed to support, but that's so much of a non-issue because it's almost not even worth it to see it on a smaller screen than a television and someday, manufacturers will start getting the hint and just continue to provide digital copies, because those work quite well.

Of course as far as the film is concerned, it's beyond classic status, and well-deserved of its vast acclaim. However, the ""Final"" cut is not extraordinarliy different, aside from some digital clean-up, some insertions of some shots from the workprint version, some shots that clean up some editing inconsitencies, and some lines of dialogue that clear up some logical inconsistencies. The most obvious difference is the digital superimposition of Joanna Cassidy's face over her very different-looking stunt-double during the Deckard-Zhora shootout sequence, which has long been a source of bother for fans.

Personally, I loved both the Theatrical Cut and the Director's cut, warts and all, so all of the Final cut changes are nice, but don't make a significant difference in the enjoyment of the film. At least Ridley Scott didn't go all Lucas on the film and start inserting scenes that make no sense and actually hurt the film more than help it (See the ""Special Editions"" of the original STAR WARS trilogy if you don't know what I mean).",1338249600,15,2942,4.878

108186,1,0790729628,"It's not my intent to anger anybody. I just want to understand. How did this movie become one of the top ten sci-fi films of all time, according to The Guardian and the American Film Institute?

I saw Blade Runner quite recently, and I wanted to like it; I've spent my life writing dystopian sci-fi novels, and my favourite things include detective stories, action movies and Phillip K. Dick. (If you think it's unfair to describe Phil as a ""thing"" rather than a person, you might not know that he was turned into an android whose whereabouts are unknown. Seriously.) But the film struck me as superficial, pretentious and dull.

You can't make statements like that without backing them up, so I will - but be warned, spoilers follow.

There's no question that the filmmakers involved were talented. Ridley Scott directed Alien. David Peoples wrote Twelve Monkeys. Harrison Ford starred in Morning Glory. But evidence of their talents is absent from Blade Runner. The excruciating tension of Alien is missing in action. Ford, whose character arc in Morning Glory was surprisingly nuanced, flatlines here as a prosaic, alcoholic womaniser. (His kissing scenes look a lot like assault.) And the matryoshka-doll of plot twists from 12 Monkeys are nowhere to be found.

You could argue that the simplistic plot is not the fault of the filmmakers, since the movie was based on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. But you would be wrong - an adaptation should outgrow the source material, not redact it. The plot of DADOES is as follows:

""In a depopulated world where animals are so revered as to fund an industry of fakes, Rick Deckard is paid to hunt androids who, but for their lack of empathy and short life-span, are identical to humans. Gradually, he realises that humans often lack empathy too, including himself, and he wonders if there is a meaningful difference between his victims and their executioner.""

Meanwhile, the plot of Blade Runner can be summarised thusly:

""In futuristic Los Angeles (just like present-day LA, but with flying cars), Rick Deckard is paid to hunt androids who, but for their short life-span, are identical to humans. Later, it turns out he, too, is an android. Credits roll.""

Opinions differ on how many twists constitutes a plot, but I'm pretty sure ""one"" doesn't quite cut it.

Critics will argue that the story wasn't the point - Blade Runner was stylistically influential. That's true; The Fifth Element, for example, was probably inspired by it. But Blade Runner wasn't in TIME magazine's list of the 100 ""most influential"" movies of all time. It was listed as one the 100 ""best"". And there's a reason that ""style over substance"" is usually cited as a bad thing.

Perhaps I'm not looking deep enough. Perhaps the movie has some symbolic or thematic importance that I'm missing. Is that right, Blade Runner?

  Blade Runner: Yes! Like, at the beginning, there's a close-up of an eye, right?

  Jack Heath: Uh-huh...

  Blade Runner: And then, Deckard's machine focuses on the eyes to tell if someone's an android!

  Jack Heath: And then?

  Blade Runner: And then an android gouges someone's eyes out! See? Eyes!

  Jack Heath: That's great, but it's not really a symbol or a theme. It's just a motif. The phrase ""See? Eyes!"" has just as much artistic merit as all that stuff in the movie.

  Blade Runner: Okay, well, what about Roy Batty?

  Jack Heath: What about him?

  Blade Runner: He's Jesus.

  Jack Heath: Because he dies at the end?

  Blade Runner: Because he sacrifices himself for Deckard, despite being cartoonishly evil up to that point. And he sticks a nail through his hand.

  Jack Heath: Why does he do that?

  Blade Runner: Because he's Jesus!

  Jack Heath: No, I get the symbolic reason, but why did he think he was doing it? What was his motivation?

  Blade Runner: I... uh... did I already mention the eyes?

  Jack Heath: You did.

  Blade Runner: Listen, I'm sick of your cheek. It doesn't matter if I have proper symbolism. I'm classy. I'm film noir.

  Jack Heath: Oh, that genre which is notoriously difficult to define? How convenient.

  Blade Runner: Every scene takes place at night. And there's a femme fatale.

  Jack Heath: The first thing you said is a plot-hole, and the femme fatale stereotype is about sixty years out of date.

  Blade Runner: Cut me some slack! I was made in 1982.

  Jack Heath: Oh, sorry; thirty years out of date. You know what we call female villains these days?

  Blade Runner: What?

  Jack Heath: Villains.

It could be that my standards are too high. I've definitely seen worse movies than Blade Runner. But in this instance, I felt betrayed, because Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was a beautiful novel. It made me chuckle, it made me weep, and most of all, it made me think. There are few things as depressing as watching your favourite characters reduced to action figures, and seeing the philosophy of a book wiped out to make room for special effects.

No doubt some readers are keen to inform me that Phillip K. Dick really liked Blade Runner, but in reality, he only saw the trailer. And do you know what else Dick liked? Amphetamines.",1337904000,6,5158,4.773606370875996

108190,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner is a great movie.  Unlike a lot of movies, though, it's not the kind of film you can just put in and sit back to watch.  It's not raw entertainment.  It's slow and doesn't have as much action as some things might lead you to believe.  The film really wants you to think instead.  It's one of those kinds of movies that asks a lot of questions but rarely gives you the answer.  So you definitely have to be in the right mood to watch it.  When you're there, though, it's quite a powerful film.

Fortunately, the collector's edition comes with a few cuts of the film (legacy of the film's troubled development).  A few people might enjoy the original theatrical release a bit more because it adds noir-style narration that explains a lot of things you'd be otherwise left to interpret on your own.  On a personal level, I prefer the latest 2007 ""Final Cut"" as I think it makes the strongest statement, even if it makes the movie less ""casually watchable.""

It's not the kind of movie everybody's going to want on their shelves but it is incredible and, when you really get into it, it's easy to see why it was so incredibly influential on the genre.",1335830400,,1160,4.4245283018867925
108191,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies of all-time. This collection is awesome. It has five different versions, including the ORIGINAL version that is so darn hard to get! The Original has the voice-over by Deckard/Ford, and is, in my opinion, the only version to watch. At least for me, anyway. The other versions seem 'distant' and 'dry'. I like getting into Deckard's mind, and the original version does just that.

This is classic Science-Fiction meets Cop and Baddies. It is way cool and awesome!

I am so happy to have found the original version! I would go to game and comic book conventions, they sometimes sell movies, but they never had a DVD copy. Now I have it! Wonderful! And on Blu-Ray no less!

Two Thumbs Up!",1335398400,,727,4.62015503875969
108192,5,0790729628,"Harrison Ford (Star Wars Han Solo and Indiana Jones) plays Deckard; a burnt-out detective on a mission to hunt down and eliminate a dangerous group of androids (called Replicants) in a futuristic society that's rendered in a hauntingly realistic way. I assume you've seen this movie by now, so expect spoilers to be found throughout this review. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Whenever I talk to my friends about movies, the question always comes up, what's your favorite movie? -or at least what's on your top ten list? Blade Runner has held a top position for many years, along with movies like 2001, Excalibur, Alien and of course Empire Strikes Back and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. I can pick many technical reasons for Blade Runner to hold the top position, from the way the special effects hold up decades later, the classic story or even the total believability of the world the characters inhabit.

Creating a story is more than developing characters or building tension to a satisfying climax. Those elements are important, but we cannot overlook the importance of creating a living and breathing universe for the story to evolve in. Mad Max and its sequel The Road Warrior gave us a post-apocalyptic world that would influence countless films and honestly speaking, let many writers off the hook from the responsibility of creating any kind of world to surround their stage. You see the dessert, a few junked cars and you know what happened before the first day of the story. It's accepted that we'll all wear rags and sport Mohawk haircuts.

Blade Runner did the same but in the opposite direction. Director Ridley Scott took the Phillip K Dick story and created a technically advanced society that was shiny at the top corporate level and yet dirty and depraved at the bottom. It feels like a proper translation of the 80s and it still feels right 30 years later. It's real to us because we can imagine ourselves living and operating in that world. It's real to us because we feel like if we live long enough we will live in that world.

Sci-fi as a genre tends to be crippled by the weight of its gadgets, gimmicks and gizmos. Many writers rely on the tech/hardware to draw us in instead of our human flaws, emotions and inner drives. Most of these heroes did, well, nothing before the first day of filming. Blade Runner has many props- from the flying police car, zeppelin-sized flying billboards to androids that can pass themselves off as human-better than Arnuuld the Terminator. All of this nerd-candy does not take the place of good story-telling and characters that change and evolve as the story progresses.

The music and soundtrack are flawless as Vangelis uses his synth-wizardry to merge the music and sound effects into a wonderful backdrop that never resorts to laser zaps to let us know we're in the future. The musical score reflects and reacts with each scene perfectly and always matches the on-screen tone.

Romance works in movies when we all want the couple together by the end of the flick. Most movies simply throw them together enough and boom, you assume after all that adventuring, they just have to hook up. Cue the big kiss and roll the credits. Chemistry is easy to create when there is only one hot chick and one hero in the movie. Star Wars was faced with a crisis as fans were split between Luke and Han for Leia. Lucas chickened out and reached way too far and suddenly decided to make Luke and Leia brother and sister ->add another yuck for the kiss in Empire. When Deckard (Ford) meets Rachael, she is stunning and also way above his level of sophistication. When he sees her next, she is vulnerable and he blows it. Later, he reaches out to her and she blows him off. Boy loses girl. BUT! She comes to the rescue and now you can't imagine them NOT together. The chemistry works for me. I would want Rachael. Hell, I want Sean Young. While all of this is happening, you are not aware that their relationship is developing, no, you are too busy worrying about robots, guns and how this whole mess will get fixed.

Bad guys are important too. Blade Runner uses the tried and true formula of a super-smart boss surrounded by not-so-smart henchmen. Certainly as simple as some of these extra characters are concerned, there are hints of additional history and relationships. If you note that Replicants are given false memories to create a cushion, Leon is carrying pictures of Zhora. Deckard found Zhora's snake's skin cell clue in the shower of  Leon's apartment. What does that tell you about the relationship between Leon and Zhora? And during her show, right before Deckard meets Zhora, you hear the host say ""Watch her take the pleasure from the snake."" Which explains why she's tickled when Deckard questions if she's even been asked to do anything offensive by the management. Very funny. Rutger Hauer is at his best playing the leader and supremely dangerous Roy Batty. It adds more tension when you believe the bad guy can beat the good guy. He is also given the wonderful privilege of delivering the best lines/monologue in the entire movie.

 Is Dekard a robot too?

Ridley Scott assured Harrison Ford that he would not be playing an android since Ford thought a robot chasing a robot wouldn't be interesting to him. In subsequent versions of the movie, deleted scenes (the infamous unicorn running in the forest dream sequence) were added that left that question a mystery and open to debate.

In conclusion, this is my favorite movie because it works for me on every level. It's a fine story wrapped in the fabric of Science Fiction.",1334188800,,5595,4.715455475946776
108193,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner is a moving work of art - a dynamic painting. It is truly tangible and should be used in art classes even. I am true to the original version with voice over, which ties the visual stream of consciousness together.",1334016000,,226,4.404761904761905
108194,5,0790729628,"Too bad that this is made by Warner, they always cut the top of the movie off to make it look widescreen. I have compared many of their movies to the VHS version and I see the top of the heads. Wow, how can they be so cheap as to say it is Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1 Even Harry Potter films show the differences and they are new pictures. Directors and actors should enforce Warner to stop the poor film manipulation of their movies when they release widescreen versions. If you don't take my word for it, then start investigating for yourself. If it isn't wide-screen, then leave it that way.

That said: the movie is one of the best Sci-Fi pictures ever. I also like Rutger telling the images that we would never see in space. That could have been extended.  At least it is a Ridley Scott film.  They should make ""Doom Omega"" into DVD

Remember, wide-screen did not start until 1954

108195,5,0790729628,I couldn't watch the movie because it wouldn't download.  After it wouldn't download.  I couldn't get it to try to download again.  I paid for a movie I couldn't watch.,1332892800,3,168,4.533333333333333
108196,4,0790729628,"Fans of Philip K. Dick are often very critical of Blade Runner. I can understand why: the movie greatly simplifies Dick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/story/dp/0345404475/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">story</a>. It removes the entire subplot with radiation victim J.R. Isidore, as well as all of Dick's peculiar cultural details, such as the near-worship of animals, the Mercerist religion, and the sinister TV host. It even removes Rick Deckard's wife. Of course the story is poorer without these sources of characterization.

But in my opinion, that's not necessarily bad, and might even have been necessary for any successful film adaptation. At its core, Dick's novel greatly resembled classic American&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/crime-fiction/dp/1883011078/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">crime fiction</a>. Rick Deckard is a lot like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philip-Marlowe/dp/0394757688/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philip Marlowe</a>, with a strong moral core and sense of obligation that rises to the surface at key moments in the story, like the conflict with Phil Resch or the final showdown with Roy Baty. Deckard's profound disgust for Baty in that last scene (""Androids do that,"" he says upon learning that the androids have senselessly killed a spider) is a perfect match for Marlowe's contempt of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lash-Canino/dp/0394758285/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lash Canino</a>&nbsp;and other thugs. The best way to portray Deckard in a film would probably be to play him exactly like Marlowe, impassive and cold, wrapped up in a hat and trench coat, but with some occasional suggestion of sorrow.

That, at least, is something that Ridley Scott can understand. He removes all of Deckard's background and characterization, but Harrison Ford can play a calm tough guy who also looks like he might be thinking something, and that's really all that's needed. The rest is atmosphere. Dick's book described a desolate post-nuclear Earth where vast tracts of land, and large parts of major cities, lay completely abandoned. Scott throws that out as well. Instead, the film looks more like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neuromancer/dp/0441012035/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neuromancer</a>: garish neon advertisements, crowded streets and ragged ne'er-do-wells. But if you keep in mind the Chandler analogy, the tone is still appropriate for Dick's story. The important thing is that the bounty hunter (or detective) is himself lonely and reserved.

There is a much bigger discrepancy between the book and the film, though, having to do with the portrayal of the androids. The film chooses to make the androids sympathetic. In some sense its biggest payoff is Rutger Hauer's famous mournful monologue, which does not appear in the book, and was in fact completely improvised on the set. It is suggested that the androids are, in fact, superior to humans, and capable of noble suffering. Their anger against humans is high tragedy, and the humans hunt them out of fear of the unknown. Even Vangelis' brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/theme-music/dp/B000002IZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">theme music</a>&nbsp;underscores the tragic romanticism of Hauer's image. Audiences have long debated whether Deckard himself might be an android; in this film, that would be a way of elevating him and giving him additional moral superiority.

But Dick's book is brutal. It unequivocally holds, with no room for ambiguity, that the androids are savage, irredeemable psychopaths. This is true not only of Roy Baty, who is supposed to be the most violent one, but also of his android wife Irmgard (absent from the film), who can imitate politeness and refinement, but who nonetheless takes an active role in dissecting the spider (a huge moral offense in the book's world). This judgment is final; androids are forever doomed to be incapable of empathy even for each other, to say nothing of any other form of life. They are united only by fear and anger. Dick treats this fact as horrifying and disturbing, but he never questions it. Of course Deckard is not an android in the book.

Which view would be better for a film version? I prefer Dick's unsentimental, unforgiving approach. But I suspect it may be unbearably oppressive in a film. It works in a more cerebral and philosophical way, as a moral meditation, whereas Hauer's tragic outlaw has more in common with glamorous Hollywood stylization. But the latter is also an integral part of film noir, which needs charismatic antagonists, worthy of testing the protagonist's limits. The logic of Blade Runner pretty much forces the androids to be the emotional lynchpins. And, after all, even in the book, one would think that humans ought to be morally culpable for creating the androids.

Ultimately both approaches are compelling. The book and the film comfortably exist side by side, exploring completely different angles of the story. In a way, Scott's choices allow the film to be experienced on its own merits: the dark cinematography and paranoid tone, the theme music, the dying monologue. The flip side of Dick's story, it would seem, can leave one just as shaken.",1332288000,4,5414,5.925736235595391

Ridley Scott's Science Fiction masterwork and possibly Harrison Ford's singular best acting job, four discs. and all three versions of the movie. The remastering is stunning, and makes it all the more stunning that ""Blade Runner"" was created before the CGI days.

In the future, Androids are called replicants, but they also are smart and strong enough to go renegade. if they do, the Blade Runners shoot them down. Deckerd (Ford) is the best of the Blade Runners, and is called upon when an escaped group of Replicants returns to earth in search of immortality. Seems they have a built in 4 year expiration date. That is, except maybe for the one called Rachel, which Deckerd may be falling in love with. Played with smokey noir feminine wiles by Sean Young, she becomes the lynchpin in Deckerd's chase for the runaways.

Noir is a major operative word here. Los Angeles in 2019 is covered in smoggy rainstorms and decaying buildings. Only the rich can afford to build themselves a place in the sun, and they're the ones making the killer bots. Which means everywhere else is darkness, shadows and slivers of light. This is easily one of the most exquisitely filmed Sci-Fi thrillers in history, which means the original cut didn't pass muster with the suits.

108265,5,0790729628,"This new four disc set finally finds all four extant versions of Blade Runner(released June/82...has it really been that long?!),in one convenient package. We have the original 1982 version,the 1982 International Cut(with extra tweaks and footage),the 1992 Directors Cut(with more tweaks and the unicorn footage added) and finally the 2007 Final Cut,most preferred by Scott and its restoration personally supervised by him...and it certainly shows.
As to what version is the best,well many better qualified reviewers and people other than myself have weighed in on this one,but I must say after a thorough look see at them all I can say I still prefer the original version;while at the same time I can see and appreciate Scott's Final version also. The original version just has so much more depth to me. The film's dystopian vision combines a future time frame with,in this case,a decidedly 40s look and feel. It is all reinforced with Deckards narration throughout which evokes a Bogart character of Sam Spade or Phillip Marlowe. To add to this is the ""fat man"" Egyptian who Deckard questions in regards to the snake scales,replete with the white suit and red felt hat,which brings back a Sydney Greenstreet character from the Maltese Falcon or Casablanca. Furthermore we have Rachel whose dress and smoking bring back memories of a Joan Crawford or Bette Davis. The cherry on the cake is the entire look of the city which has a good dollop of Metropolis with a dash of Logan's Run thrown in to boot. This look is in all versions of course,but that mixed with the aforementioned attributes,creates,for me at least,a much richer viewing experience.
The Final cut is beautifully and lovingly restored. Scott has gone to great lengths and has taken care of some needed fixes like the slightly out of sync lips-to-voice in the latter part of the film. You might notice near the end where the dove flies out of Roys hands and upward,the sky is blue in the previous versions. In the final new version the sky is grey. It makes sense as one may ask where is all the rain coming from?One bugaboo they have NOT taken care of in any version is that of Leon's conversation. Specifically,Leon,a replicant,has infiltrated the Tyrell Corp.and is under going a routine verbal test with a corporate employee at the beginning of the film. Just before Leon kills that employee,he says""Let me tell you about my mother"".On a playback of the convo in a Spinner later on,Deckard now hears""I'll tell you about my mother"". All they had to do was switch the first convo into the playback in the Spinner,but.... .
I won't go into any great detail on the(now)well known plot,but for those who may be new to the film,I will give you the Readers Digest version. The time is 2019 and the main protagonist is Deckard(Harrison Ford)a so called Blade Runner. He is charged with running down and killing rogue replicants,built by the Tyrell Corp. A small cadre of replicants have come back to the city to infiltrate the corporation,intent unknown. As the film progresses we find out they want their incept or inception/creation dates,altered,thus extending their lives. It turns out this is impossible and the film comes down to a showdown between the last remaining replicant Roy(Rutger Hauer,in possibly his best role ever)and Deckard. Hanging off a building girder and about to fall to his death,Roy saves Deckards life,and as he watches Roy die he is left to ponder why. Deckard returns home to Rachel(a replicant who Deckard has fallen in love with),and they both flee the city for a new life.
All the films stars both major and minor including:James Wong as Chew,Darryl Hannah as Pris,E.Emmett Walsh as Bryant,James Olmos as Gaff,Joe Turkel as Tyrell,Joanna Cassidy as Zhora,Brion James as Leon,etc.,ALL to a person do a wonderful jobs in fleshing out their roles. Scott does a great job in bringing the ever wet and depressing atmosphere of the city to life. Vangellis,who was on a role from his previous award winning triumph the year before for his music in Chariots of Fire,is on hand to provide the always subtle but appropriate music for this film.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1. The first three films have been remastered nicely and all come on disc three. That is alot of info to put onto one disc and I thought the compression ratio would become a factor but it didn't surface as one..surprisingly. The Final cut is on disc one. All discs by the way are feathered one over the other in groups of two,on either side of the case which opens up. Extras abound here and they include:a new documentary on the making of the film with deleted and altered scenes,numerous featurettes new and old on the production,design and restoration of the film. There are enough extras here to keep a fan glued to his or her seat for literally hours.
All in all a highly recommended DVD set. A remarkable job in remastering and restoration is in evidence here and all versions are here for your enjoyment. My preferred version is the original but I also can see and appreciate Scott's vision for the Final cut and like that too. The beauty of this however is that we can all decide where our loyalties lie in the end.",1322956800,2,5217,4.81716833890747

108270,5,0790729628,"Bladerunner fans are divided in 2 camps: those who love Deckard's voice-over and those who hate it.  This fantastic set should satisfy everyone. The first disc is the 2007 'Final Cut' that seems to be a beefed-up version of the 1992 'Director's Cut', made for this DVD set. Great picture.  Great sound.  Definitely watch this one with the headphones on.  The soundtrack is as layered as the visuals are.  This version also has 3 different commentaries, including the 2 writers, Ridley and Doug Trumbull (special effects genius behind 2001 and Silent Running).
  The 3rd disc is the archival one with 3 versions of Bladerunner: the U.S. Theatrical release, the International Theatrical release and the 1992 Director's cut (no commentaries).  For voice-over lovers, watch the International one.  It's 10 seconds longer than the U.S. one because of the extended violence... Roy Batty gouging out the eyes of his maker and pushing a nail through his hand.  Apparently, Americans can't handle watching this kind of thing, so these scenes are shortened in the U.S. version.  The director's cuts, of course, have no happy ending, the inclusion of the unicorn scene (which somehow proves that Deckard's a replicant) and no voice-over.
  The 4th disc is a grab-bag of everything else.  More info about Philip K. Dick. The best thing on this disc is the tribute to Bladerunner's amazing D.O.P., Jordan Cronenweth, the Rembrandt of film-making. Jordan paints with light from a base of darkness.  People and shapes emerge beautifully from the murky blackness. There's some original 1982 featurettes, a walk through the set with Syn Mead, mini-docs on costume design, deleted scenes and the final word on the 'is Deckard a Nexus 12 or what?' question.  Personally, I think, since it's almost always pure luck that saves Deckard's hide all the way through the movie, I'd say that if he's a Replicant he definitely came from the Reject pile over at Tyrell Corp.
  My favorite disc is number 2 which is one long documentary of the making of Bladerunner, from Dick's novel through to this DVD set.  Excellent.
  I chose this set over the 5-disc set which costs twice as much because, as far as I could tell the only difference is the inclusion of one more version... the 1982 work print.  I figure I have enough here without it and I definitely didn't need the origami unicorn, the model flying cop car or Deckard's briefcase that it all comes in.  I figure, that's what you're paying the extra money for... the toys.
  The packaging of the 4-disc set is beautiful, subtle and elegant, designed for a true collector.  These qualities match the way I think of Ridley Scott's directing style, especially this movie... subtle and elegant.",1322092800,,2718,4.931718061674009

The future was here and I had been lucky, well sort of, to be immersed into the future. The movie had me almost hyperventilating. Over the years I have watched Blade Runner numerous times. Though all acted superbly, and the visuals and the special affects were superb it was Rutger Hauer's role as Roy Batty that made the film catch fire. There is plenty of symbolic characters to go around but it is clear that Hauer's character is the new Christ figure. Besides putting the nail in his hand and being called savior, he saves Deckart, (Harrison Fords) Judas character. The importance of the new philosophy is in Hauer's killing the creator.

Special effects done over 20 years ago were optics and models, and they appear just as crisp and clean as anything computer generated would appear now.  I can't believe how the images constantly jump off the screen at me, and the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is just as amazing as the visuals.

My only complaint is that the movie starts playing with a default Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack when I pop it in my player, and I have to manually use a pop-up menu to choose the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It seems that with lossless soundtracks being the default standard for 99.99% of Blu-ray releases that the TrueHD soundtrack would be the first one to start playing on any machine (as all Blu-ray machines can down-mix that soundtrack to standard Dolby Digital for receivers that don't support TrueHD).",1317859200,2,955,4.660714285714286

In my opinion, they should have left the original version ALONE, because all they did was ruin the film by attempting to revise the film to suit their own egos.  Without the narrative, someone viewing the film fails to understand the inner thoughts of the character, which is vital to the purpose of the film.

I have also read the original book this movie was based on and if they wanted to actually improve the film, they could have shown (Decker) Harris Ford taking the test himself, thus, finding out he was not a replicant.

In conclusion, I am sure many Blade Runner fans disagree with my review, but after personally talking with at least five Blade Runner fans, they all agree the original version is still the best.

The scenes which are supposed to leave one wondering whether Deckard is also a replicant are lame and stupid - they add zero to the narrative and are precisely as Yorkin loabeled them: a cheat. Not only a cheat, but one which adds nothing to the story.

108317,5,0790729628,"My earliest memories of Blade Runner go back to the Fall of 81. As a kid, I was a subscriber to Starlog Magazine. It was a popular sci-fi movie mag of the time. It featured an article on Harrison Ford's next film ""Blade Runner"". The article showed a few production shots of the Spinner and some of the overall aesthetic. Here I was, 12 years old, and my favorite actor was about to delve into yet another sci-fi/fantasy flick. I was thrilled!! I figured..here's Han/Indy playing a futuristic cop hunting killer androids in an environment of flying cars and neon. What more could a kid ask for???

Fast forward to June 1982...My best friend and I sneak into our first ""R"" rated movie together. Nearly thirteen years old...I watched the opening sequence with delight and wonder. It was an incredibly realized world. However...as the film progressed...I simply didn't get it. It felt too dark, depressing, and wrought with DIALOGUE instead of ACTION. In other words...it wasn't FUN. However, something struck a chord with me. I never could pinpoint what it was as a thirteen-year-old. It still befuddled me the following year when it made it's HBO debut, but I watched it religiously each time it aired.

Here we are now, some twenty-nine years after it's debut, and I am STILL finding new ways to view this film.

This is why Blade Runner remains, in my opinion, one of the greatest and most important films in cinematic history. The film CHALLENGES you on so many levels. On one side, it's a sci-fi thriller...on another, a deep and thought provoking look into the metaphysical dimensions of humanity. It questions what it means to be ""human"" and, by extension, what it means to BE. These philosophical questions are further challenged by the revelation that Rick Deckard may very well have been a Replicant as well. Granted, Ridley Scott has already stated (once and for all) that YES HE IS. However, I prefer the ambiguity and like being challenged with that notion with each viewing.

Lets face it...this is one of those rarest of films that provokes either a great LOVE for it...or a great HATRED for it. I have never known anyone that was a casual Blade Runner fan. No one says ""Oh yeah...that was pretty good"". I like being one of the devout fans out there.

It is, in my mind, as close to a perfect film as one could make. From the visuals, to the script, the performances, lighting...etc, it's a challenge to find any fault with it. It is paced well and doesn't dwell on excessive exposition. Not everything needs to be spelled out to the viewer and Scott does a fantastic job of letting the viewer think for themself. This is why the opening sequence is such a marvel, because it is literally carrying the viewer into that world.

As far as the Blu Ray set goes...it is worth every penny and MORE. As gorgeous as this film is...the transfer makes it nearly ethereal. I enjoy the fact that I can watch any one of five cuts of the film and will likely get something different each time. The bonus features are extensive and none of the usual ""filler"" features are present. It would seem that this is the DEFINITIVE release of Blade Runner. I can't imagine Warner Bros. adding anything else in future releases.",1316476800,6,3215,4.671378091872792
108318,5,0790729628,"I'll keep this short and sweet:  Blade Runner is one of my absolute favorite movies, if not my number one pick.  The Final Cut is the definitive version of the film, as it doesn't have the tacked-on (and horribly cheesy) ending, nor Harrison Ford's lazy, tiresome voiceover.  This film stands on its own, and if you haven't seen Blade Runner before, this is absolutely the version to get.  Superb on every level imaginable.

This particular transfer is as good as we're ever going to get.  It's got some minor flaws here and there (particularly with some bits of uncompressed audio), but the messy production that plagued this film from its very inception is primarily to blame.  In this case, its the film's imperfections that give it so much charm.

If you only have a stereo system, this Blu-ray won't murder your ears.  The Dolby TrueHD audio track sounds great on stereo speakers.  I wanted to point this out, because I know a lot of people don't have 5.1 surround sound systems, and unfortunately a majority of Blu-rays lack a stereo track, so the movie becomes a bit odd to watch.  This is not the case with Blade Runner, so purchase away!

For the big fans or the collectors out there, keep in mind that this Blu-ray I'm reviewing is the single-disc version.  You will not get the 'Dangerous Days' documentary that tends to be so revered in the community.  If you're interested in that, the DVD multi-disc version is cheap, and you won't be missing out on quality.

I don't know if there's something wrong with Blu Ray 5 disc Bladerunner that I got, but the 'Final-Cut' disc (which I watched first); the 'time to die' scene i.e. with Batty releasing the dove etc; one of the flaws that the final cut was meant to correct was the blue, earling morning sky that the dove flies up into - which is in stark contrast to the smog laden, techno, industrial, retro-fitted builidngs / L.A. scenery in the rest of the film. However, in this final cut; it's exactly the same i.e. the dove flying up into the out of contrast, early morning clear blue sky i.e. exactly the same as in the original 1982 / voice-over, theatrical version and the 1992 Directors Cut!!! And the scene where Deckard's at Abdul Ben Hassan's investigating the snake; some of the dialogue's still out of sync, even after the final cut's makers went to the trouble of getting in Harrison Fords son, Ben Ford to do green screen shots so his lips could be composited to make it look Harrison Ford's lips / mouth etc. And the makers of the final cut went to the trouble of fixing the fact that, if you look closely enough at the earlier versions i.e. where Zhora's running out of Taffy Lewis's bar; she's apparently wearing stilleto's and then not wearing them in the next shot (where she bursts out on to the street), but this wasn't noticable to me anyway (and beleive me I've watched Bladerunner countless times). In other words; it was such a minor detail and yet in the final cut, they apparently fixed this and yet seem to neglect much more obvious flaws e.g. the dove flying up into the clear blue sky... even though they made a special, new landscape shot for this i.e. with the dove flying up into a rumbling, dark cloud / smog laden sky; past retro-fitted, futuristic, multi-layered, instrustrial, techno buildings (like it should've been), but for some reason, this wasn't in the Blu Ray final cut that I received!

And the final cut omits the cool music at the opening credits roll and the other touch ups are barely noticeable anyway. Also, the final cut put's in this crappy, supposedly suspensful music at the showdown i.e. where Batty's chasing Deckard in the Bradbury apartments; I much prefered how it was in the theatrical and directors cuts. OK, the final cut's got some extra / additional footage which hardcore Bladerunner fans have known about, but never actually seen on screen i.e. in the downtown / 'fourth sector', L.A. street scenes e.g. the dancers in the tubes etc., but apart from that, the final cut's not that great.

I want to say I can also see some ""problems"" at the beginning in the opening sequence with all the special effects in Los Angeles' futuristic landscape, but the detail is so amazing and the transfer so crisp, that I was hard-pressed to find anything wrong with it. All colors, lines, detail and special effects were pretty much immaculate and very crisp. No annoying blocky dark patches, no fuzzy effects overlaid over the film's original background, nothing. Like I said: I was really trying hard to see any visual problems and I think I just ""convinced"" myself I could see some in very few places.

Whew! The Final Cut is finally here, and I have to say, of all the versions I've seen, this is my favorite. I have owned this movie on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray, and I am completely amazed at how good this movie looks on the Blu-ray transfer.

I was hesitant to get it. I get tired of all the various versions that keep coming out for movies (and I just see it as a money-making excuse for the production companies to cash-in on a movie, rather than provide anything substantial for fans; yeah, I know, I'm cynical that way).

But, I'm a huge Harrison Ford fan...Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Hunt for Red October, Regarding Henry...he's made a lot, but those are my favorites...and I had to have Blade Runner on Blu-ray.  I've not seen the other Blu-ray versions, so I can't really comment on their qualities, but I have to say this version of the movie is my favorite. It had been awhile since I'd seen it, and this Blu-ray version and transfer are proud members of my collection now.

You want a review of the movie? It's good. Not great, but it's good. It's a dark and brooding glimpse of the underbelly of the future, although I can't see (and hope it doesn't) look like this in the future, 8 years from now. Harrison Ford's job is to terminate (""retire"") synthetic human-looking robots that are too human and have been deemed illegal on Earth. Rutger Hauer is in true form as the deranged, psychopathic leader of the replicants that come back to Earth to meet their creator face-to-face and demand that they be given a chance to LIVE! They've been preprogrammed and hardwired for a 4 year lifespan, and they don't like it. Harrison Ford finds himself coming out of pseudo-retirement to bring down these highly dangerous, very lifelike enemies, and soon realizes he has feelings for another replicant...and things get ""complicated"".

This movie is stylistically and artistically a visual treat to watch. Every scene just drips with detail and dark ambiance, whether it's the gorgeous futurerealistic cityscapes, or the dark underbelly of the city in even its rundown environs...it just has a visual style that is interesting to watch.",1312416000,12,2924,4.712328767123288
108340,5,0790729628,"In the future, scientists create ""Replicants"", genetically engineered biological slaves pretty much, that are described as being ""More human than human"" (Remember that cool Rob Zombie song from Astro Creep 2000 titled ""More Human Than Human""? A great song that was heavily inspired by this movie.). That is the main premise of the movie ""Blade Runner"". Replicants are used to fight wars, do offworld mining, and all kinds of other mundane, dirty and dangerous jobs that most people wish not to do. The Tyrell Corporation is one of the biggest manufacturers of Replicants on the planet.

Well it seems that a group of 4 Replicants no longer wish to be slaves to humans, and especially do not like the 4 year lifespan that they have been genetically programmed with in order to keep them from becoming too smart and emotionally experienced. After all, how else could you control an advanced genetically engineered slave and keep them in line with your directives if not to limit their ways and means of knowledge and experience? So Roy Batty, played by the menacing Rutger Hauer, and his team of rebel replicants kill a bunch of offworld people and head to planet Earth in order to meet their maker and have a little talk with him. Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a ""Blade Runner"". A guy whose speciality is ""retiring"" rogue replicants (A fancy way of saying 'killing'.)

In order to get more information about this certain group of rebel replicants that he is assigned to terminate, Deckard heads to the Tyrell corporation where he meets Rachael, played by Sean Young, a secretary of the Tyrell corporation and also a new generation replicant who does not realize that she is a replicant. Soon enough Deckard falls madly in love with Rachael.

Anyway, can Deckard stop the evil replicants lead by the wily and determined Roy Batty from performing their mission on Earth, and also find true love and happiness with Rachael? You will just have to watch the movie to find that out.

I first saw Blade Runner in the theater way back in 1982 when it was first released and I enjoyed it pretty much. It was a nice little noirish sci fi thriller that had a grim view of how the future (2019) would look like such as constant acid rain falling from the sky, and all the other depressing things that go along with it that we have seen in many other countless dystopian films since this movie's release.

I owned Blade Runner on VHS and watched it every now and then over the years. It was an interesting movie to watch, especially for the performances of Harrison Ford, and the most excellent and menacing Rutger Hauer, and the superb special effects of futuristic buildings and flying cars of the supposed future (Yet no cell phones or laptop computers are present in this movie, ironically? Something that other futuristic movies, most notably the Star Trek films happened to get right.)

Anyway, this review is for the DVD ""The Final Cut"" version that I watched, and the picture and sound of it all was simply stunning, and it also features extended scenes and previously unseen footage that previous versions of the film lacked. If you are one of the few people who has not seen Blade Runner yet, then I highly recommend that you give this film a view. It's a really good thought-provoking film that is worth at least one viewing. It is also the final cut of the film that is most-endorsed by the director Ridley Scott.",1312329600,4,3423,4.706176961602671
108341,5,0790729628,"How does one perfect on perfection? Well, what little there was left to improve upon, director Ridley Scott found a way. Blade Runner has a checkered past. Its production was plauged with monumental problems from start to finish. Even with the changed ending and the naration added in, the theatrical release is still an incredible film to behold.

For Ridley Scott who is a perfectionist, it went over budget causing issues with the studios. Upon its late summer release, Blade Runner was pitted against summer block busters like Star Trek II,E.T and surprise hits like Conan The Barbarian. With its dark story and content, it didn't stand a chance with the public's demand for ""feel good pictures"" and ""happy endings"".

Flash forward 10 years and Blade Runner finds new life and appreciation with ""the director's cut"",the version that it was meant to be and be seen. And now 15 years following its director's cut re-release; Ridley Scott's ""Final Cut"" of Blade Runner is the ultimate masterpiece in Sci-Fi film noir.

There is nothing to pick on in this version of Blade Runner, it is flawless and still to this day, I get goose bumps and the hairs on the back of my neck stand up from the opening scene of the not too distant future of the hellish,overpopulated,polluted horizon of 2019 Los Angeles. This is a captivationg story that most all of you know is based on the Phillip K. Dick novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""

As with most novels turned film, the screen play deviates quite a bit from the novel, but retains its basic elements and Dick's portrayl of a dark,dismal,over populated, disconnected,technology dependent and polluted future which doesn't stray too far from our present day reality. His ever questioning ""What makes us human?"" is the real character basis and drive in Blade Runner and ""Do we as humans have the right to play god?""

Sumerized to its basics, Replicants are artifiscial humans that are genetically designed for combat or for dangerous,toxic work that humans cannot do. They are superior in strength and at least as intelligent as the scientists and engineers who designed them.

Problems with replicants caused their makers to instill a four year life span and after some escape and find their way back to L.A, our plot thickens. Deckard is an Ex cop/Blade Runner. Someone who hunts down illegal replicants and retires them. After he is forced back into service, he is put on the case to flush out the tresspassing humanoids and dispose of them. On that journey, he uncovers far more as the case unravels.

To tell more would ruin seeing the film if you haven't seen it already. You really have to like ""film noir"" and with Blade Runner's Sci-Fi roots and dark atmosphere, it just really melds perfectly with the screen play. Harrison Ford is as dry and strait arrow of a character as you could think of. Hardned from his past as a Blade Runner and alomst as emotionless as those he hunts.

Not enough can be said about what it really means to have  excellent writers in tune with the material they put to screen. Blade Runner also has probably the most incredible cinemaphotography seen on screen in 80's cinema. It is beautifully photographed frame to frame and scene to scene, and  let's not forget about the amazing visual effects produced by Douglas Trumbol.

Next to Return of the Jedi, Blade Runner is probably amongst the last Sci-Fi masterpieces of visual effects. All was done practically with flawless matte paintings,light,smoke and superbly hand crafted film miniatures long before computers and CG became a regular tool at the disposal of directors and FX studios.

If you are a true fan of cinema, sci-fi and great story telling, no DVD library should be without Blade Runner. I've been a huge fan of Blade Runner since its debut and while many don't like or appreciate the original theatrical release it is still a fine film even with the flaws.

However, to find true appreciation of this film masterpoiece, ""The Final Cut"" is about as perfect as it gets. It has been digitally ""cleaned up"", but really only one scene CG enhanced to mark a monumental improvement  and eye sore over the original. This is Ridley Scott's finest film I.M.O and it is shameful that he was passed up for recognition let alone an Oscar and that the film was passed over for multiple Oscar nominations at the time so long ago.

What could be more perfect than a film that keeps coming back that no one really forgets as it rises from the ashes like a Pheonix to be re-invented?If you love film, film noir and good sci-fi you will never tire of this film. I can watch it over and over and always discover something new. Most films fade away, but its the true classic that never dies and sears itself into your memory, and Blade Runner ""The Final Cut"" is one of them.",1312156800,3,4808,4.73444976076555

I'll just briefly go over what's necessary to convince you to buy this exact item on Amazon.com.  First, the blu-ray transfer is top notch as far as I can tell.  I'm running it on a very nice 55"" Sony Bravia LCD LED tv with a very nice Sony Blu Ray player & Sony 7.1 BraviaSync Receiver with Bose Speakers and subwoofer.  I'm an audiophile and cinephile, but I couldn't measure the differences really in a coherent manner well enough to describe the details to you.  It looks great and sounds great.  That's all I can really say about that.  Second, the release of The Final Cut itself is spectacular to the Nth degree, partly because of the re-edits, but mostly because of the clean up and remastering and what not.  The packaging and shipping, well done as well.  It came in a few days and wasn't damaged at all.  Not much to really live up to with just a Bluray to be sent.

If you think star wars is good you will be in for a surprise when you see blade runner which blows away star wars in depth and real human dialog.

108355,5,0790729628,"The million dollar question:Is Deckard a replicant? An even better question: Out of all the characters in the entire movie who's not a replicant? Blade Runner. The movie. The myth. The Legend. This film was directed by Ridley Scott. Volumes have been written detailing the amount of work and effort poured into making this film. The set, the screenplay, the acting, and the soundtrack. The effort is clear and evident in every frame. This is science fiction masterclass. At the core it accomplishes the true purpose of science fiction: to inspire contemplation of the future. It is futuristic, enlightening, terrifying, and ultra violent. Blade Runner has the look and feel of science fiction films that came out during this time period. This one really set the standard high and reveals once and ultimately for all that modern computerized CGI is no match for raw imagination, meticulous attention to detail, and genius set design. Blade Runner presents a futuristic vision of what urban sprawl may be like in the near future. Everything is very cramped and processed including the human beings or replicants. The plot is pretty simple and straight forward. The story is about an officer of the law (blade runner) that is in charge of hunting and eliminating a group of rouge androids in a futuristic Los Angels. The androids have evolved and started thinking for themselves. The lead android is played with ferocity by Rutger Hauer. The role of Deckard is also one of Harrison Ford strongest signature lead roles in league with Indiana Jones and Han Solo. Other notable roles are played by: Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, and Joe Turkel. The soundtrack to film was created by Vangelis and is equally as visionary and an amazing triumph on its own. Many forces came together to make this film possible. Above all else this film succeeds because of the source material the screenplay was drawn from. Blade Runner is loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. In connection to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep the movie Blade Runner presents concepts concerning creation and the very evolution of the human mind. This is a timeless concept presented beautifully in this film.",1310515200,,2251,4.98936170212766
108356,4,0790729628,"Blade Runner(released June/82-has it been that long?)has been re-released onto DVD and this time around Ridley Scott himself has supervised the remastering,tweaking several scenes and boosting the background sound/music. The movie has never looked as good as this....ever. This release's major drawback however is the removal of Ford's background narration throughout,which certainly detracts from Scott's original vision but,like Spielberg,Lucas,et al,they can and do do what they want with their product. I must admit that even with the loss of the voice track,this version IS quite compelling and makes for an excellent comparison between the original cut and this one.
The story is well known by now. It is 2019 and Deckard(Harrison Ford)is a cop dedicated to the elimination of Replicants. These androids,built by the Tyrell Corporation,are on an equal par in many respects with humans and as a result have been banned to the outer worlds as workers. However a group of Replicants rebelled and some made their way back to Earth and into Deckards path. One by one Deckard hunts them down. Deckard even meets with the great Tyrell himself and falls in love with one of his personal Replicants who doesn't know she is one until Deckard reveals the truth to her(Sean Young).The rogue Replicants are paired down eventually to two(played by Darryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer) who visit one of Tyrell's valuable assistants,who in turn persuade him to take them to the inventor. The inventor projects a kind of a cautious fatherly attitude towards his inventions,whose main objective is to find out how long they have to live(they have a built in safeguard life span of about four years into them)and to stop the process. It seems there isn't a way to reverse the dying process in the Replicants and Tyrell is summarily killed.
Two Replicants are whittled to one and Deckard tracks him down,but it becomes a chase to live for Deckard,as he becomes the prey instead of the hunter. The Replicant at times plays with Deckard knowing his own inevitable end is near and before he can make the coup de gras he indeed dies. Deckard returns to his apartment where he and Tyrells Replicant leave the city forever.
This film moves along very well,telling its story in measured increments,never losing ground at any time. The entire look of the city from the flying cars to the giant advertising boards to the rainy and grungy streets have been more than a huge influence to countless films and filmmakers since its release. Scott was on a definite hot streak at this time as his Alien film was and has been a terribly big influence also. The acting from everyone involved is fantastic and was a break through film for many of its participants.
Technically the film looks absolutely gorgeous and it is in its widescreen a/r. Other than extensive commentaries by Scott and several production crew members,that is all the extras there is.
All in all a highly recommended release. If the  Deckard commentary had have been there I would have given this film a BIG five stars all the way. However despite its' deletion,the film is still excellent in this form,and through Scott's tweaking,it has come through as a close second to the original.",1310515200,,3221,4.975881261595547
108357,5,0790729628,"Normally, I would post this as feedback for the sellers; however, this is a larger issue than that.  I ordered this from two different companies and both copies had a deep, two-inch long gash in the case.  It was the same size and at the same location for both copies (I had not yet returned the first one when the replacement I ordered arrived today).  In each case, the gash was covered up by a label - laid right across the gash to conceal it - at least most of it.  I write this here because it may be a supplier issue rather than a seller issue since the same defect was covered up the same way with the same type label when ordered from two distinct companies - at least the company names are distinct.

I did not open the cases to inspect the damage to the DVDs because I wanted to return the DVDs unopened so they could see the damage.

If you order this awesome movie from an Amazon Marketplace business, check under the labels before opening the DVD - it is very noticeable.

108360,5,0790729628,"** This is a Review for the 4-Disc Box set **

Blade Runner is a masterpiece of a movie which presents a fantastic sci-fi vision of the future; that over 30 years later still stands strong.  The movie has a very ""cyber-punk"" feel to it, and does an exceptional job of integrating the viewer into this visionary style of the future.

For those unfamiliar with Blade Runner; The Movie is about a man named Deckard who specializes in hunting ""Replicants"".  A Replicant is essentially a clone of a human that has a fixed lifespan and exists in off-world colonies.  Well A bunch of Replicants have escaped and come to Earth and it is Deckard's job to hunt down these replicant's and kill them.  In doing so this tests Deckard's understanding of what it means to be human and the value of life.

This is a movie that in 1982 was ahead of its time, a brilliant masterpiece that perfectly molds Science Fiction, Drama, and Detective work together.  What the 4 Disk Collectors Edition contains is a vast amount of bonus content that will please any Blade Runner fan, and make a great piece in a movie collection.

Disk 1: The Final Cut(2007)  This is a completely restored version of the movie. Digitally Restored and Remastered, this version contains additional footage over the director's cut and even improves upon the special effects.  The soundtrack has also been remastered in 5.1

The 4-version package is a wonderful plus. While the changes in the final cut to the director's are few, there are a couple nice touches that help define the characters just that much more. And yes, the final cut is still without the film noir voice-over, for those who can't quite find that info on the studio descriptions.

108374,5,0790729628,"As a collector of Blu-rays, I must say this is one of the best, if not the best addition I have made to my collection thus far.  In fact the only two which come close in terms of quality and sheer amount of content are ""Apocalypse Now: Full Disclosure"" and the ""Alien Anthology""  Blu rays.  Blade Runner is not only one of the greatest films of all time, it is a sparkling example of how the idea of the 'director as the author' can create a profoundly different film.

Of the FIVE copies of the film included, my personal favorite is the Final Cut, which is Director Ridley Scott's true view of what the film should be.  If you have only seen the theatrical version, or the 'director's cut' (which actually was edited by the studio, not Scott), you will feel like you are watching an entirely new film.  Finally, the 'workprint' is the most raw of the versions, but for fans of the film, it is a must watch so they can see the developmental process of the film.

The second disk contains a 'making-of' Documentary, which is actually longer than the film itself.  This documentary is not like the featurettes you'll find on most films, but instead a full, comprehensive look at the making of Blade Runner and the lives of the people working on it.  Really the only film I could use as a comparison is 'Hearts of Darkness', which is a documentary on the making of Apocalypse Now (which is included in the Full Disclosure).

Overall, if you're a fan of the film, considering the average price of a Blu-ray is around $20, the extra $10 goes a long, long way.  I can not recommend this purchase highly enough.",1306800000,,1605,4.4436860068259385

Despite seeing all the versions, the re-mastering, the enhanced digital imagery, the altered scenes (like the dove taking off into the blue sky), the extra scenes (at the noodle stand) etc. etc., my favorite version, the one I like to watch often, is the laserdisc version of the Director's cut. I like the colors and there is a certain mystery and warmth to the scenes ... When I watch the Blu-Ray version, although it is much clearer and has more visible detail, the colors seem brighter, clearer and the movie's atmosphere doesn't hold...

I just bought this set from Target for $29.99. Disc 1 labeled ""Final Cut"" is actually the Workprint Disc 5. I called Warner and a new BRD will arrive in 1-2 weeks, no charge and I don't have to return anything.

ONLY THE MOST HARDCORE FANS should endevour this task. You're 50/50 on getting the correct discs in the set. And with gas being ~$4 a gallon, can you afford driving back and forth 1-4x? If you are a completist like I am, you want ALL the cuts, so you have to invest 1-2 weeks getting the Final Cut (it's worth it BTW) or you can just buy the 2-disc Final Cut Blu-Ray if you just want the final version (and best version).

I gave this 3 stars since the movie and quality is great. But 2 years later, the quality control is STILL crap.",1304899200,2,993,4.238095238095238
108381,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner is one of the most influential science fiction films of all time and it's also a film that has stood the test of time incredibly well. While Harrison Ford already had the first two Star Wars films and Raiders of the Lost Ark under his belt by the time Blade Runner was released, the sci-fi thriller can certainly be labeled as the film that put Rutger Hauer on the map while Roy Batty is probably Hauer's most recognized role. After Alien, Blade Runner is one of the main films that first added credibility to Ridley Scott's name. Despite its flaws, Blade Runner is still a brilliant sci-fi film that seems to get better with each viewing.

The atmosphere in Blade Runner is revolutionary and thick right from the start. The Los Angeles of 2019 features the likes of flying cars called spinners, giant skyscrapers riddled with moving advertisements and commercials, and the Voight-Kampff machine (VK for short) to help determine if someone is a replicant among many other cutting edge things. The lighting in the film is key to making the film feel as futuristic as it does. Take any scene where Deckard is in the depths of Los Angeles. Those congested city lights are probably the main visuals you'll take away from those scenes. When Deckard first meets up with Captain Bryant, Bryant runs down the list of Nexus 6 replicants. A blue light blankets the room they're in. There's something about that blue light along with that conversation between Deckard and Bryant that makes that scene incredibly memorable.

Blade Runner is based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. I've never read it, but I certainly intend to. I'm unsure how similar the film is to the source material though. Other than the film still feeling like a neo-noir film set in the future without feeling too dated, an extraordinary story is buried underneath. Genetically engineered organic robots take center stage, but just the idea of something like implanted memories will make the wheels in your brain spin a little faster. Everyone has heard of ""making friends,"" but its definition will be a little bit different after one viewing of this film as Gaff's origami will be one of the last things on your mind once the film ends. There's a lot to take in with Blade Runner. There are several layers to the film and it certainly requires multiple viewings.

Blade Runner may come off as a frustrating experience at first and that could come down to which version of the film you watch. There are at least five different versions of the film and that could be a bit overwhelming. I'm pretty sure I originally sat through the theatrical version at first, which I thought was okay. My general consensus was that there was a fantastic film buried down in there somewhere, but it felt like I was missing something; almost as if there was an entire film before this one that everyone else had seen but me and I decided to jump in later on. That's where the frustration came in. I wanted to like this film, but it was difficult to do so when nothing really seemed to add up. After viewing The Final Cut a few times, things are a bit more clear and it seems like I'm able to catch certain things I didn't catch during the previous viewing. I'd recommend checking out The Final Cut first and then venturing onto the other versions of the film, if the interest is still there.

While we're on the subject, is it just me or is Deckard kind of a wimp? On the surface, he's fairly similar to the other roles that made Harrison Ford famous. But once the action starts getting heavy, Deckard is usually on the receiving end of a beatdown without much offense on his part. In the entire film, he lands one punch, three gunshots, and two pipe swings. He spends a good portion of the film getting roughed up by women and then he practically rapes a replicant. He just seems like an odd choice for a hero. Rick Deckard is still an exceptional character, but just kind of a bizarre protagonist once you think about it. Roy Batty is definitely worth a mention or two, as well. Any scene with Roy is guaranteed to be good, but his highlight is of course the rooftop scene. The chase through The Bradbury is just as good though. That ""tears in the rain"" speech that Roy makes at the end is something that'll live on for decades. It's just so perfect and the fact that it was partially improvised by Hauer just makes it all the more spectacular.

In the end, there probably isn't a whole lot that can be said about a film like Blade Runner that hasn't already been said. The cast is near perfect, especially Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer, the storyline in the film is done so well that it seems to unravel a few pieces at a time every time you sit down to watch it, and the film is just able to offer a spectacular vision of the future that still looks and feels like the future thirty years after the fact. Although, this is one film you should try to catch in theaters if at all possible as it sounds incredible. Throw in the fantastic lighting to help establish the futuristic atmosphere and the film is rounded out so well that not much else can compare to it. Blade Runner is a film that makes you think and makes you admire things you normally wouldn't in a film. It's a sci-fi masterpiece that was definitely ahead of its time. Films like this don't come along very often. They should be cherished to your best ability while you're able to do so before they're lost in time...like tears in the rain.",1304208000,,5499,4.528169014084507
108382,4,0790729628,"I first saw this movie at the cinema when it came out in the early 1980's. I remember it as being a very unusual movie then,but not as unusual now with the changes in themes, and in movie technology.

108393,5,0790729628,"Some impressions.  ""Blade Runner"" was a decade or two before it's time, yet being nearly a perfect film, it remains a timeless classic.  My preference remains with the theatrical version.  The voice-over by Ford is well-written and adds another layer/dimension, as well as some much-needed explanation.  The director's cut (without the narrative) seems vacuous.  Whichever version, the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film are tedious.  How many times do we see Leon's dialog with the Tyrell rep and the shooting?  Leon was not my favorite character and his hesitant answers to the rep are not really suspenseful or entertaining.  Within a few seconds you get the idea that Leon is a dim wit, a nervous dim wit, but the scene goes on and on.  This is followed with Deckard and the precinct head detective -- again watching Leon's less than spectacularly surprising shooting.  The same scene is thrown at us again as Deckard is driving/flying around.  Once I get past the basically crappy beginning, I'm glued in.  Harrison Ford is very good in this film but is eclipsed by Rutger Hauer's portrayal of Roy Baty (the IMDB shows the character as Roy Batty but this is incorrect -- as displayed in the novel and in the movie.  Given my last name, this was something I couldn't help but notice.)  Hauer's performance is mesmerizing.  A tremendous amount of credit also goes to Sean Young's performance as Rachel.  An amazingly beautiful woman (in my humble estimation), Ridley Scott's framing/lighting, etc., emphasize her femininity/fragility and an odd combination of near angelic innocence mixed with astute intelligence and keen perception.  Replicant or not Sean Young convincingly plays the type of woman that any man (well, almost any man, I suppose) would die for.  She's not just a ""pleasure unit."" Rachel is sophisticated, complex, sensual.  Probably, she is conceived to be an idealized woman, a kind of ""Stepford Wife"" minus the zombie attributes.  Not only is Sean Young stunning in appearance, she also has the most feminine, soft, gentle-sounding voice I've ever heard.  I could listen to her recite ""The Iliad"" (or anything else) ad infinitum and remain transfixed.  The addition of Rachel in the story is imperative.  ""She is the business.""  The selection of Sean Young to play this role was a masterstroke.  Sean Young had a few halfway decent roles after ""Blade Runner,"" but this will remain her crowning jewel.  Last news I remember of Sean Young is her going after the role of Catwoman in Tim Burton's second entree in the early Batman franchise.  I think she came to the audition in a full-on Catwoman costume of some kind.  Somehow this incident (if true) translated into Young being a wacko.  That's Hollywood for you.  Her role in David Lynch's strange interpretation of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" was also right on the mark.  I think all actors are a little bit ""nutty.""  I think they have to be in order to subsume their own identity and fall into character.  I simply wish that Sean Young had been given greater opportunities.  Like so many other truly beautiful actresses, she seems to have vanished.  Unless an actress is able to ascend to the Meryl Streep or Cate Blanchett level, they are evidently excreted from the biz once the bloom of youth fades.  Compare this with the longevity of male actors -- both highly talented and semi-talented.",1303171200,,3369,4.932384341637011

108435,3,0790729628,"As a big fan of the movie, I was really anticipating watching Blade Runner on Blu-Ray on my new HDTV. However, it was a disappointment. Not just because the changes in the Final Cut didn't do much for me, but also because of the changes they made in the Director's Cut, which I thought was going to simply be the same as the DVD release, but at higher resolution. I was wrong. One of the reasons I really like the Director's Cut is the unicorn scene, and that's one of the changes that bummed me out about this Blu-Ray release. Originally the unicorn scene is tinted a beautiful, dreamy yellow, and in combination with the Vangelis music, it's just an epic thing to watch. For some reason, though, they got rid of the tint in BOTH the Blu-Ray Final Cut and Director's Cut versions, leaving the scene with normal light and thus feeling less transcendent, less emotional, and more mundane. Very disappointed in that. They have also messed with the coloration of other scenes, such as Deckard's first scene in the movie, where he's sitting in the rain, waiting for a seat at the Japanese food stand. It was originally awash with a beautiful deep, moody blue; now it's kind of a harsh, electric white. The same for the food stand, which had a lot more atmospheric lighting with lots of yellow elements; now it seems kind of washed out, too. There may be more changes in coloration for the rest of the movie, but I haven't made it that far in my viewing yet. I really wish they had just updated the special effects and not messed with the color palette, which was perfect before. What a let-down. I will therefore be hanging onto my DVD two-disc edition of the Director's Cut and sadly I will endure the low resolution when I want to watch it, because even with low resolution it's visually superior to this messed up release in the Blu-Ray edition. I hope they do a re-release of the Director's Cut in Blu-Ray with the original coloration someday.",1291248000,10,1943,4.538461538461538
108436,5,0790729628,"The Film:
In my opinion, one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made.  It was released in 1982 and to this day nothing comes close; visually, aurally, and maybe even emotionally.  The cast and crew put their blood, sweat, and tears into this and it shows in every frame.  In spite of all this, you'll either love it or hate it, but give it at least two viewings before you decide, there are a lot of subtleties to pick up on.  This is not an action film, it's a noir and also a bit on the artsy side (and it pains me to use this word, I don't consider myself to be an artsy person).  The first time I watched it my thoughts were along the line of ""...Okay?"", I went back to it a year later and it all just suddenly clicked.  I now place it among my top favorite films and I've seen it at least six times in the few years since.  Everything about it is just flawless, the writing, the acting, the sets and lighting, the music etc. all come together to create a stunning whole (I could praise the sets and music until I'm blue in the face, amazing).  When you watch it, be sure and do it right; watch it late at night, lights out, without any distractions (in fact, this is one of the few movies that I prefer to watch alone), it's the only way to do it.  This is not a daytime, friends over and chatting movie, you'll ruin it for yourself. Again, give it at least two tries before you make up your mind on it.  Many, many people dislike it at first glance (probably in part because it's so different from the mainstream and what we are accustomed to) but it often grows on them upon subsequent viewings.

The Final Cut Edition:
Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player or the latest greatest television, but even on DVD on my 32"" 720p LCD it looks fantastic.  Beautifully remastered picture and sound, and the scene extensions, while all short, are a welcome addition.  They also did a really great job digitally adding Zhora's real face back in, to where it no longer looks like a stuntwoman with an afro-wig.  It truly is seamless now.  Fear not however, this is not a George Lucas style re-release and it is not wildly altered, it is absolutely the original Blade Runner film that everyone knows and loves, only it has now been brought to perfection.  The big issue that will divide some viewers is the voice-over narration, or rather, the lack thereof.  Personally, I prefer it without the narration (I just thought it sounded really cheesy and poorly done and detracted from the greatness of the film), the lack of narration only makes me enjoy the Final Cut even more, but I know that some people prefer it with the narration and if you really have to have it then look elsewhere, it is entirely absent here.  The cheesy tacked-on ending (the one that included landscape footage from the shooting of ""The Shining"") was also axed and now we get a good one that better fits the nature of the film (again, my opinion).  There is also a few hours worth of documentary on the second disc that I enjoyed.

All-in-all, a must-own.  Yes, it's true, you might not like it, but you owe it to yourself to give it a chance (two chances).  It may just end up becoming a favorite and drawing you deep into its beautifully bleak world as it did with me.  Highly, highly recommended, this is a masterpiece in every sense.",1291075200,9,3339,4.391869918699187
108437,5,0790729628,"When discussing the works of Ripley Scott, it is extremely difficult at best not to use such cerebrally intimidating terms such as ""eclectic"", ""noir"", and ""dazzling technology"". As such, this review will attempt to keep such terms to a minimum.
 In 1979 Ridley Scotts second film that he ever made, ""Alien"", was a smash hit. (His first film ever was ""The Duelist"" in 1977, in case you were wondering). The movie Alien was hailed as a masterpiece in which he mixed visceral horror with science fiction. Its no surprise then, that Scott's third movie, he mixed film noir and science fiction in much the same way to make the technically astonishing movie ""Blade Runner"" based on the 1968 classic by Phillip Dick called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". Although it did not do well at the box office, is another stroke of genius. As the movie starts off, there is a virtual tour of futuristic Los Angeles. The movie watcher is made to feel as if they have awoken from a cryonic chamber and are observing the changes that have taken place.: The weather and environmental color is drab, there are gigantic animated billboards offering goods and services(something that didn't exist in 1982 but already exists now), and  that Coke is still around. Even though the scenes were constructed using 1982 technology, they are still breathless and when viewed on a flat screen TV are close to three dimensional. Next is the introduction to the melancholic Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who in contrast of the Replicants that he chases, appears to take life for granted. The philosophical themes in this picture are endless. One popular philosophy is that Deckard himself is a Replicant this theory is doubtful as Replicants appear to be superior in strength and maybe even intelligence to humans. Deckard is only able to bring Replicants down to retirement by relying on the one edge that humans have over Replicants: experience. Since Replicants can only live for four years, they do not have as much experience at anything as their human counterparts.  In addition to the movies in depth philosophy, Blade Runner makes several realistic predictions: (1) Los Angeles/California is predicted as being culturally isolated and diverse to the point of mayhem. This forecast is even more probable today, than it was in 1982. California and especially Los Angeles has already become extremely diverse culturally. Caucasians no longer represent the majority of the population. Additionally, each ethnic group tends to isolate from the other ethnic groups. There is Chinatown, Korea Town, Olvera Street, and Watts. Each neighborhood has its own cultures and languages that are not only spoken, but seen on Billboards and even street signs. Select cultures are even pandered to by the government. Even though it is currently the law to be a US Citizen to vote and to have a driver's license, and even though it is a requirement to read English to become a US citizen, Drivers License exams and ballots are written in Spanish and many of the Asian languages. There is no need or incentive for an immigrant to assimilate into one uniform society. (2) Technology continues to advance at a prolific rate. From 1982 to 2010, technology has grown tremendously. No one in 1982 would have dreamed of DVDs, flat screen TVs, GPS  systems, iPods, or cell phones that do just about everything would be in wide use in 2010. Flying cars may not be far off. It would appear that the only thing that might prevent Replicants from ever being built would be a possible ethical/political dilemma much like the one that surrounds cloning. (3) The weather and environment appears to be drearier. As global warming theories and oil and other toxic spills become more prevalent, this event is quite possible. (4) Big Corporations still exist and exert their influence. From the Coke billboards to the billboards offering a better life on a space colony, consumers are still being told that their life is inadequate but could be made better if they purchased certain products or moved to a ""better"" location.

108439,5,0790729628,"Harrison Ford stars in the dystopian noir set several years into the future. Blade Runner is one of the few movies that has managed to withstand the test of time on a visual level as well as a remain one of the most, dare I say, innovative title's that have ever graced my audio/visual senses. The movie itself is one of exploration into futuristic themes such as identity and love in a world where artificial beings called ""Replicants,"" being banned on Earth, are virtually identical to human beings. Rick Deckard (Ford) is a retired detective, or as the title suggests ""Blade Runner"" who is hired once again to hunt down several rampant Replicants. The movie stands as a character study of both Deckard and several replicants as they struggle to grasp the concept of life and its value.

It's not so much about being futuristic as it is about creating a noir-esque atmosphere for which the characters can develop in, it just so happens that it does this in such an efficient manner that it comes off as wholly believable on every level. Looking at the film you can definitely see the 80's influence, though this film does not struggle to go above and beyond film's of it's genre even today, as it surpasses most recent sci-fi flicks. I found the subtle 80's feel to be very delightful, especially as it shines through in Vangelis' absolutely amazing soundtrack, which without, the movie would only be a shell of what it is.

The Blu-Ray five disc Complete Collector's Edition has enough extras to keep your Blade Runner hunger at bay as it features every version of the film released including both narrated and non narrated versions with deleted scenes that escalate the Blade Runner atmosphere ever so much higher.

Blade Runner stands as one of the few films, if not the only film, that I have ever seen that turned out to be more than one hundred percent satisfactory on every possible detail that could be reviewed. My only hope is that you, the doubtful reader of reviews, can at least rent this masterpiece and enjoy it as much as I have.",1290384000,3,2047,4.664819944598338

Almost 10 years ago I wrote a review here about the Directors Cut of Blade Runner. But where was the original release! Moreover, where could I get the European (International) release!!!

This 5 disc set now offers that and more.

Apart from the Final Cut and the Directors Cut it also includes the 1982 US and International release. Finally. In addition, the Work Print. Then on top of that there are 2 DVD's with highly detailed and interesting background information about the movie and what went into producing it. These DVD's include interviews with just about everybody involved in the making of the movie.

For any Blade Runner fan I am sure that they will enjoy viewing these DVD's in addition to the selections of Blue Ray movie releases.

The elements that really buy this film to such epic proportions is it's Brilliant dark murky yet dense execution of a future los Angeles  also compained by a powerful complex intricate  and fascinating script with lots of fascinating sub-themes and connations and symbolism which although i didn't always quite spot when i heard of them it made me look back and see just how inspired these writers were  not only that the way the elements are mixed together film noir ,romance action-adventure and philosphy and existenal themes of life how long  we have to live it and the moral boundaries we posess as humans and how our prejudices and advances can in a way dehumanize or desentize us to common murder and the subtle way the film builds suspense is great.  Performance-wise no one really does a bad job Harrison Ford is perfect as Deckard he starts off the right amount of dry wit and reserved moody attitude but he turns more emotional and vigourous and commandering as the film goes by . Sean Young although not one of hollywood's most famous actresses brings the right amount of feisty and tender vunerability to the role and overall does excellent work and Ruget Hauer is phenomal as Roy Batty bringing the emotions of curiousity, intensity ruthlessness, wonder , sophistacation , desperation and fear and anguish and vegance together wonderfully and Daryl hannah holds her own well as Pris and johanna Cassiday is very tough fesity ,edgy and exotic as Zhora and Edward james Olmos as Gaff who is mostly slient still manages to be effective due to his unique way of communicating with Deckard with his orgamis and delivers one of the film's final lines very well and the guy who played Taffey Lewis was great too .  Fianlly the action sequences were very intense and realistic and were coordinated very well and not felt akward or out of place and the music by Vangelis was very good setting the tone very well as it communicates our emotions in a sense it has that mystical feel of awe when the film 1st opens and the sultry tone it has when Deckard starts to fall for Deckard and it has operatic crescendo feel when Batty attacks Tyrell and the fast-paced techhno-feel at the end was nice and the technology created for the film was very creative and well-used within the context of the film. Overall Blade runner is a perfectly excellent film with beautiful visuals fantastic rich writing great acting great score and very imagnative and exotic feel to it definitely worth checking out can't wait to see that blu-ray! 10 out of 10  "" All those moments will be lost like tears in the rain.""",1290124800,,2819,4.711382113821138

Acting, sound track, dialog, story line, sets, costumes, special effects, lighting, it's all here and all superbly done. The Final Cut is the film we all knew Blade Runner could be.

This edge of your seat gruesome look into free for all capitalism is more relevant than the day it was made. Can you say 'genetically modified organism'? Don't kid yourself the issues addressed in this film are real and becoming more urgent of attention every day.

After almost 30 years this movie looks as if it could have been made today. After nearly 20 years since seeing the directors cut and getting an idea of the potential in the film I expected it to come across as dated. But to my surprise and delight it holds up as well as it ever did. The final cut gets rid of all the annoying narration that ruined the original release and also gets rid of the typical 'boy get's girl they live happily ever after' ending that is so incongruous to rest of the movie.

108454,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner:Final Cut has seen Ridley Scott ditch the voice-over narrative by Ford and up-beat happy ending and added a dream sequence of Deckard's of a unicorn,thus proving he's a replicant too. The film adapted from Philip K Dick's, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a cult classic. In Dick's work on which this film is based, is an obsession with the blurring of reality, dreams and waking confused together, mechanical replicas indistinguishable from their originals,what is humanity?This hard-boiled SF noir set in a dystopian future with an impoverished nature and looming towers,balls of flame in the skies. The drifting ex-cop Deckard(Ford) is pulled back into the loop of bounty-hunting replicants,who have illegally returned from outer planets,where they are slaves,to find the secret to a longer life on earth. Dramatic action has replaced overt philosophising to good effect. Four androids are at large and Deckard must hunt them down.

The ways they are tested is by answering a series of questions,the answers to which show whether they have humanity. Although they failed the test,their behaviour is empathetic. Deckard finds enough life and humanity in these entities to stimulate his own sense of empathy. Deckard discovers not unfeeling robots he supposed them to be,but creatures in search of warmth,affection and personal ties he and his fellow natural beings are losing. Boundaries blur from sociopathy to empathy,and humans increasingly lose their souls in dealing out death and destruction or in materialistic pursuits. The dehumanising effects of technology on human life are latent. Androids become more `life-like' over time,humans more robotic to meet society's needs. Androids' intelligence surpasses humans,what about their rights?Are androids entitled to share our life,are we grateful for our life?Can't androids dream of electric sheep?

The Tyrell Corporation can do nothing to help,it has even programmed `memories' of childhood years,which is shown to deceive Rachel(Young)into thinking she is human. When Deckard forms an attachment to her (she also saves his life),he is forced to rethink what it is to be human and to be mortal. Although Deckard loves Rachel he is intent, while saving her, to kill all the other replicants. The human story,though somewhat subdued and thin,is overshadowed by the extraordinary sets and special effects,which are amazing. Are humans without emotions more valuable than machines with?Rutger Hauer's Roy gives a soliloquy prior to his own death (and after saving Deckard's life),about a replicant's dilemma:""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.""This is a thoroughly moving speech by a time-fixed replicant aware of mortality who has transfixed Deckard with his emotions and desire to have him as witness. The rain-soaked ,decaying Los Angeles of 2019 is vividly realized. The film addresses the psychological aspects of the future,not the CGI effects,not the action,but the everyday lives of ordinary people under horrendous conditions. The slower rhythmns and pace of things brings this out. I believe the Final Cut is the best version, the one intended by the director and should be the one we settle down with,as it bypasses the studio's sabotage through fear of what the director intended. Ignore the 'directors' version. He had no hand in it.",1289260800,,3504,5.380692167577413

For 25 years, since I was a kid in the 80s, I have never made it through a complete viewing of this film. All I have stored in my memory are bits and pieces. The problem in the past is the film does not keep my attention. I figured maybe I was too young to enjoy the concepts, or I wasn't listening to the dialog closely, or whatever.

20something years later and after numerous releases and reedits (so I've heard) this film still cant hold my attention. And thats a shame because Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors and he normally excells in films like these. The sci fi neo tokyo environment is great but watching him constantly mope around his dark apartment drinking and staring at underdeveloped pictures was dreadful. The pacing is horrid, as usual I was sleep within the first hour and will likely never see this through to the end.

I wrote a 35-page college paper on this film in the spring of 1985, and my narrow-minded snob of a professor rejected it, telling me she'd never seen it, that I'd picked a ""pop"" movie.

This film is so much more than sci-fi meets film noir.  Its beauty lies in the fact that you can take it as a simple cop-chases-bad-guy flick, complete with intrigue, fights, shooting, and a confused woman with a mysterious past.  Or you can take it as tale of doomed romance.  Or, it's a terrestrial sci-fi adventure, a meditation on the wages of off-world conscript warfare coming home.  It's all of these, and more.  The sci-fi context is a thoroughly realistic and accessible near-future, yet the movie is grounded in a climate-shattered L.A. where the global economy we know now is right in your face, and living in the streets.

I absolutely love this film, and have from that autumn night in 1982 when I was one of the few to see it in a theater.  I've seen this film more than 400 times in the past 27 years, I know it all by heart, and still am not tired of watching it; I see something new every time.  From its visually stunning and aurally scintillating opening to the end titles, in all of its various cuts, its soundtracks, its groundbreaking and still-awesome F/X and intricate production values, its feel--more than anything the questions it raises about life, and living a life--the film continues to enthrall me.  As we get ever closer to the day when a ""manufactured person"" of real flesh, blood and bone is a reality, the film asks the simple question: what exactly constitutes being human?

So, what is human?  How is it defined, and who gets to make the definition?  Simply a creature born of another human?  Or is it the individuality and (for want of a better term) ""soul"" living inside an easily replicable biological frame?  Is the concept of a ""soul,"" in the context of growing--and selling--fully grown humans for corporate profit, even worth discussing any longer? Can a living thing created in a laboratory, for purely commercial purposes, be considered a human?  Yes, they are faster, stronger, in many ways better than we ""normal"" humans, but who wouldn't take those options at birth, if they could be given?  Our almost-protagonist replicants are impetuous, capricious, immature, and then unflinchingly brutal, but then again, that describes anyone we know, or read about in the newspaper every day.  They are self-aware, and fully cognizant of their own mortality, and set about in deliberate fashion to defeat death, and more than anything, this seems to show how truly human they are.  When this film was made, almost 30 years ago, this was far-reaching stuff, real science fiction.  Now, with gene therapy, artificial tissues, experimental replacement organs both synthetic and organic, the opening of public debate about building sex robots and dating and even marrying automata, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gattaca/dp/B0011UF79C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gattaca</a>&nbsp;future of genetic options unfolding rapidly, these questions aren't farfetched fiction, they're contemporary.

The music: Massive thanks to Vangelis for finally delivering us&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/his-original-sountrack/dp/B000002IZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">his original sountrack</a>.  It is a masterful rendering of the inspired work that helped make this movie the milestone that it is.  Yes, I'll go on record: I do enjoy the 1982&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-American-Orchestra-recording/dp/B000002KYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New American Orchestra recording</a>&nbsp;that came out in the 80s.  Despite what the purists say, these are satisfying symphony orchestra covers of Vangelis' unmistakable soundtrack originals, softened and de-electronified, somewhat more commercially accessible.

If you've read Philip K. Dick's original novel, then you will know that this is the very basic story, but little else of that translates here.  If you love the movie, you might like the book, but be warned that Dick's writing style, while full of imagination and observations on issues of humanity in the face of scientific advancement--he wrote the originals that became Total Recall, Minority Report, and Paycheck, after all--can be, well, slow.

If you love this film, you must read Paul Sammon's Future Noir.  It is the definitive saga of the making of this film, and is full of incredible trivia, like how Robert Mitchum was the original vision of Deckard, and how Dustin Hoffman interviewed/auditioned for the role for months.  Or the fact that in some of the cityscapes, old Star Wars Millennium Falcon models were used in the background.

Bottom line: This is a classic, enduring American film, right up there with On the Waterfront, Taxi Driver, The Wizard of Oz, etc.  Its vision is breathtaking, and its single-minded attention to detail makes it come flawlessly together.  Whether or not you enjoy science fiction, this film will touch some part of you.",1282176000,2,6968,6.201663201663202

The various elements of detailed realistic cityscape models, brooding pulsing electronic music, and interesting future city technology are all excellent.  There are, however, things that don't make sense.  First, the introduction describes ""robot evolution"" for the Replicants, but later on, the creator scientist is talking about cells and a ""newly-formed DNA strand""; robots don't have cells and DNA strands, and biological beings cannot put their hands in extremely-hot water and punch their arms and heads through walls and glass and be completely unaffected by such actions; while the movie presents the Replicants' rigid actions in the manner of a robot, the current promotion of the film now describes them as biological beings; the lack of meaningful definition for the Replicants' essence is an important conceptual void in the movie.  Second, after having a calm, meditative conversation with his creator about the possibility of extending life, the Replicant Batty whimsically kills his creator and another man who had helped him; this violent action makes no sense and apparently was put in the film for shock effect and to show the Replicants as a menace to society.  Third, Sean Young's character's stiffened hair and fashion appears to be that of a 1930s-1940s actress that is very incongruent with the futuristic vision of city society.

In this Four-Disc Collector's Edition of Blade Runner, the Final Cut (2007) is about the same as the Director's Cut (1992), which was disappointing to me.  I liked the 1982 U.S. and International versions on Disc 3, because they have Harrison Ford's narration, which gave a meaningful spirit to the movie.  On Disc 4: Enhancement Archive, I especially liked watching the many Deleted And Alternate scenes, which add interesting depth to the movie.

Blade Runner has many excellent elements, but there is no meaningful foundation for the Replicants and their amazing actions.",1277683200,,2040,5.330218068535825

My wife and I watched the Director's Final Cut first since it was the first disc in the series.  (She had never seen the movie.) Later on we watched the theatrical release version.  To tell the truth, I liked the original theatrical release version better.  While both are dark and depressing, the original version is less so than the Final Cut version.  Also a bit less violent.  Although I have always admired Blade Runner as being the first of the genre of dark, depressing, dystopian science fiction movies - that has spawned dozens of derivatives and imitators - in the intervening 30 years since its first release my taste for dark and depressing has lessened.  Frankly, the original version is more satisfying to me than the Director's version.  There are three more discs in the set that I haven't watched yet.  My wife isn't interested in the ""Making of the Movie"" features that come with many discs, so it will have to wait until I have some spare time.

108502,5,0790729628,"Having upgraded my 10 year old Toshiba DVD player after the laser stopped playing DVDs, I decided to treat my new Panasonic BD60 to Blade Runner The Final Cut as my first Blu-ray purchase (BD60 is a lovely quality, great value player BTW).

As a UK customer, I decided to purchase the US 5 disc edition as I don't think it's available here. When it promptly arrived (within a couple of weeks of my order) I ended up with one of the problem batches of the film, where disc 1 is a duplicate of the 'workprint' version on disc 5. Upon further searching on the internet I discovered that this was a common problem, and emailed Amazon. To my delight, they sent out another package for free, told me I could keep the existing discs to do with as I pleased and assured me the replacement would be perfect. A couple of weeks later it arrived and was indeed free from any duplicate issues.

It goes without saying that the Final Cut print on Blu-ray looks and sounds absoultely stunning (I managed to catch it at the cinema a few years ago when it was on limited release, just one week if I recall, and remember being blown away on the big screen as well).

Although not always the absolute cheapest option, I find the customer service with Amazon (UK and USA) an important factor when buying on the net, and it's the main reason why I return to them over many other sites.

108505,5,0790729628,"So, yeah, in case the review title didn't make it clear enough, I love this movie.  How can a collaboration between Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford, Vangelis, Syd Mead, and Douglas Trumbull not be awesome?  The casting, acting, screenplay, music, and visual effects - especially the visual effects - are beyond compare in every way, and the atmosphere is miles ahead of anything else.

That said, of the seven (!) official edits of the movie, none of them truly do it justice.  The Workprint has great pacing and some plot-critical lines (""Hello, Roy,"" and ""Pris or Zhora."") that are missing from other versions, but is rather noticeably unfinished.  The Final Cut has the advantage of complete digital restoration and some goof correction, but it moves too quickly (yes, I said too quickly - watch the Workprint if you want to see heavy, deliberate pacing done right) and has Scott's awful, revisionist, mood-killing ""unicorn dream"".  The less said about the theatrical version, the better.

Thankfully, though, it's now possible to experience the strengths of all of these versions, and more, in crystal-clear HD resolution, along with loads of extra features and some great packaging.  (And, if you have the means, you can edit together your own cut with your favorite elements from each.)  After more than 25 years, Blade Runner has finally gotten the treatment that it deserves - and, believe me, it deserves quite a lot.  What are you waiting for?  BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!

(By the way, this movie is NOT cyberpunk.  People who call it cyberpunk don't know what cyberpunk actually is.  Also, the replicants are synthetic humans, not robots.  It's like the difference between Number Six and Data.)",1275091200,,1694,5.0

Secondly, you don't have the ability to use bookmarks in the BD version.  And lastly, on the HD DVD edition if you paused the movie a little timeline would appear showing you were you are in the movie, that feature is not in the BD version.

Blade Runner is a 1982 science fiction/dystopian future type of film starring Harrison Ford and directed by Ridley Scott. Ford plays a semi-retired Blade Runner in LA in 2019. Blade Runners are police officers whose sole job is to chase down and ""retire"" (a synonym for kill) replicants. Replicants are humanoids that are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, created by the Tyrell Corporation, but which have been banned from Earth due a violent uprising that occurred in the years before the events in this film. They are now limited to off world colonies, doing dangerous work that humans can't or won't do. At the beginning of Blade Runner, we learn that a group of 4, cunning replicants have returned to Earth and are going on a rampage.  Ford's character - Rick Deckard - is a retired Blade Runner who is called back into service to help track down and retire these out of control replicants. During his quest, Ford comes across Rachel, a replicant that is employed by Tyrell company as the CEO's personal assistant, that is somewhat of an anomaly - she's called ""an experiment"" - because, unlike the other replicants that Tyrell has produced, Rachel actually has memories, albeit ones that come from Tyrell's niece. As the movie progresses, Ford develops feelings for Rachel that he struggles with periodically during his quest.

I had never seen this movie before, ever, even though we have the DVD at my home and my husband absolutely adores the movie.  It apparently also has a cult following - now not so much a cult following as a mainstream following.  And I can see why - it's a pretty good movie. What shocked me is that people agreed that when this film was released in the theaters in the early 80's, it was a complete and utter flop. People hated it.  No clue why because Scott created a really good movie with Harrison Ford as his lead man. Thematically, the movie was attractive because it dealt with themes of memory and identity and how they are intertwined: are they intertwined, how much does one impact the other if at all, etc. I really enjoyed how the scenes were shot and the sets themselves. The darkness, with some brief interludes of light, fit in very well together and added to the overall feel.",1272844800,,2563,4.6219780219780215

108525,5,0790729628,"Finally, the greatest science fiction film ever made, the way it was meant to be seen.  Ridley Scott & Co. have gone to great lengths to craft an all-new cut of the film, consistent with Scott's true vision for Blade Runner.  This new ""Final Cut"" truly is the definitive version of Blade Runner, and after years of half-hearted acceptance of a so-called ""Director's Cut"" made in the director's absence, fans can sit back and enjoy the film that we SHOULD have gotten a quarter century sooner.  Of course, with so much time now past, Scott and his team make use of the new technologies at hand, but never undercut the original FX.  Indeed, the original Visual Effects supervisors were brought in to shepherd and approve the new digital FX, with complete respect for their original work in 1982.  Also of note is the improved color timing of the Final Cut, which serves to enhance the neo-noir style and atmosphere of the film.

Of course, for those who may not share my feelings of complete satisfaction regarding the Final Cut, this set also includes the U.S. and International Theatrical Cuts, the 1992 Director's Cut, and the fabled Workprint from the Denver and Dallas screenings.  While the Director's Cut was one of the very first DVDs on the open market back in 1997, this is the first time the theatrical cuts have been made available since the Criterion laserdisc of the International Cut, and the first chance for fans to own the Workprint.  And though the Workprint is as rough as may be expected, all cuts of the film benefit greatly from the 1080p presentation of Blu-Ray.  The look of Blade Runner on BD is highly cinematic and certainly reference quality.  A fine layer of film grain is present throughout, colors are rich and vibrant, and the detail is astonishing.

If you're not sold yet, there's also a three and a half hour documentary on the making of the film.  And even with its incredible runtime, not a single moment of Dangerous Days is filler.  It's easily the most comprehensive documentary I've ever seen on any film, covering every conceivable topic, from conception to legacy, from every conceivable angle, with a host of interviews.  And if that's not enough, there's a fifth disc with even MORE extras, including a feature on the history of the alternate cuts and the restoration and creation of the Final Cut.  In short, the extras are every bit as definitive as the rest of the package.  You get every cut of the film in HD, and hours upon hours of extras (in standard definition), all for an extremely reasonable price.

If you're even remotely a fan of Blade Runner, you owe it to yourself to own this set, and to see the film in such amazing detail.  I owned the DVD set prior to this, and the quality there was as strong as standard definition would allow.  The Blu-Ray set absolutely trounces it in every way.

Even the animals are scarce. Rick Deckard played by Harrison Ford is a retired hunter of robots called a Blade Runner. 4 cyborgs called replicants have escaped from a space colony. They're very dangerous models types, and it's illegal for them to even be on earth. They look human. Deckard is called in to resume his job as a Blade Runner and destroy them.

Deckard sees it as a job he wants to get over with. But something in him changes as he goes after these replicants. The main creator of them named Tyrel of the Tyrel Corporation's motto is, ""More human than human."" These latest escaped models are nexus 6's, they can even be smarter than most humans. The leader of the escaped group is Roy played by Rutger Hauer and the other three are Prise, Zhora, and Leon. They have a purpose as to why they have left for earth. Which is tragic yet shows one of the reasons they can be so hostile and angry.

Deckard does alot of investigation throughout the movie to track the replicants down. There are a few good action scenes, but there are a number of dialogue scenes that carry alot of dramatic themes in them. These dramatic themes are what really made Blade Runner very different from many other sci fi movies.

Rachael played by Sean Young has an influence on Deckard's life, whether she realizes it or not. She is a new model of replicant, who has something the escaped ones do not have. She is allowed to stay on earth through Tyrel's permission. Deckard is a pretty cold guy and straight to business, we see him transform throughout the movie as he meets all these characters.

The scenery is very dark, and it rains alot. Riddley Scott's films are usualy like that. This is the same man who did Alien. It does fit in with the seriousness tone of the movie. Everywhere you see are endless buildings. The special effects still hold up, they had to spend alot of time on models and lighting to do alot of their scenes. This was before CG came in to help with that. This is all in the behind the scenes disc.

There are 4 discs. Disc 1 is the final cut, Disc 2 has the making of Blade Runner, Disc 3 has the theatrical, international, and the director's cut. Disc 4 has all the bonuses with deleted and alternate scenes, image galleries, screen tests, and featurettes.

The HD-DVD version of the ""Final Cut"" disc DOES include the Dolby TrueHD.  This appears to be an engineering oversight on the Blu-Ray version.  This is not acceptable.  The manufacturer MUST be aware of this.  As a result I cannot recommend that anyone waste [...] bucks on this collection.  I give the video 5 stars but the audio doesn't even warrant half a star so I'm giving it the average--2 stars.",1264636800,3,891,4.777777777777778

It's one thing to send out the wrong version to physical addresses--with 5 of them out there, I can see how packaging could get mixed up--sort of.

But how in the world can the the 2-day download version of the Final Cut be mislabeled? It is timed at 1 hour 58, a full 20 minutes short of the Final Cut version, so is no substitute.

Baffled and really kinda ticked off. Have a guest here to watch with me, popcorn, etc.

This edition brings all of these (and a couple other key archival versions) together in one place. While I am a fan of the Final Cut and do think that it will become recognized as both the definitive and artistically best version of the film in the future, the others are also here in case you prefer them.

I have done extensive academic research using Blade Runner and have found this version to be perfect for all of my needs - the interviews and other bonus materials supplement the archival versions nicely.

I thought this kind of thing only happened to OTHER people.
I hope Warner Video responds to my complaint and makes it right.

Meanwhile, it was good to revisit this classic, but imperfect, movie.  I first saw this as a youngster when it premiered in theaters back in '82, and numerous times since in its various incarnations.  Here are some observations upon watching it again with ""fresh eyes"":  Great cast... all except for Harrison Ford.  I never really noticed (or acknowledged) how terrible his performance is.  It is ""sub-Keanu"".  Ford appears to be in a coma/pot-stupor throughout the movie and is truly the weak link in an otherwise exceptional cast.  There are plenty of actors from the era who could have done so much better playing Deckard.  But nothing can be done about that now.

I was impressed with the skill Sean Young brought to such a flimsy character.  Good job, girl!  Same goes for the other broads: Daryl Hannah (sexy and creepy) and Joanna Cassidy (sexy and violent).  Cassidy is onscreen so briefly but provides the movie's liveliest scenes (and not JUST because she gets topless).  Most of the film's (few) laughs come from the lively, otherworldly Rutger Hauer.  Brion James seemed to be an unusual choice to play Leon but is thoroughly effective.  William Sanderson, Joe Turkel, Edward James Olmos (saying olmos nothing) M. Emmet Walsh, even James ""Lo Pan"" Hong: all delightful.

The movie really could have benefited from more energetic scenes like those featuring Cassidy.  This is why audiences were initially irked by the movie upon its original release: the preview was specatcular and this was Ford's follow-up to ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"".  We were expecting an action spectacle.  But the film has endured as a classic due to the considerable richness of its other qualities.

Here's another observation: ""Blade Runner"" is very Kubrickian.  Despite the terrific cast, the photography is the star.  Special effects maestro Doug Trumbull also worked on ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and here, as on that film, his work is still dazzling and magical after all these years.  It should also be noted that both movies feature a prominent Pan Am logo whereas that company did not last into the time-periods depicted in either!  Sure, Joe Turkel appeared in a couple of Kubrick movies, but tell me that the nose on J.F. Sebastian's diminutive ""friend"" is not almost identical to the one on the mask that Alex wore in ""A Clockwork Orange"", or that the replicant eyes do not remind one of the eye of HAL 9000.

There's probably numerous other comparisons to be made if one has the time.  But I've got better things to do.  Like writing lengthy reviews on Amazon that no one will read.",1262822400,3,2867,4.819672131147541
108601,5,0790729628,".. it's the film that started it all! A classic Philip K. Dick novel immortalized by some of the best creative minds in the business at the time. A good portion of credit for this film needs to also go to Jordan Scott Cronenweth (cinematographer/DOP) who not only crafted the visual spaces and scenes, but also created a timeless template for generations of filmmakers showing them ""this is how it's done"". Created well before the advent of GUI's and mega-budgets this film stands alone as one of the best Sci-Fi's of all time. The complex blend of visual textures mixed with an expansive multi-layered soundtrack subjectively transplant the audience to another time and place, a feat only a handful of films in this genre have ever managed to accomplish.

108603,5,0790729628,"Until the release of 'The Matrix', the film Blade Runner was considered by many as the finest work of Science Fiction to date. Everything that had to be written about Blade Runner as a movie has been written, so I will just focus on this particular Blu-ray release. In my opinion, it is one of the finest Blu-ray conversions of any movie I have ever seen, certainly for a movie with this many years.

The first thing you will notice is that this particular package includes more relevant material about the movie than any other release (that I am aware of). In addition to the 'Final Cut' (the actual Blu-ray product) this five-disc set includes the theatrical US and International releases (both in standard definition) as well as bonus material, such as a clip on the life of Philip K. Dick, who wrote 'Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep?', on which the movie is based.

The actual Blu-ray conversion (which, as I mentioned before, is the 'Final Cut' version) can be considered a standard by which older movies should be upgraded to high definition. For starters, the Studio logos are not simply upscaled, but are recreated anew. This puts you on notice on the commitment of the authors to the quality of the conversion. Then, the opening scene (the gloomy skyline of L.A. in the year 2017 - I may be off by a year or so) is simply fantastic. But the high quality of the conversion is not limited to the CG shots: as the scenery moves to the street action, you continue to enjoy excellent quality of image. The sound is equally good, and if you are able to crank up the volume on a 5+1 home theater audio system, you will not be disappointed.

In sum, you can not go wrong with this Blade Runner release: it is reasonably priced, has lots of material, and the main feature is released on Blu-ray on a level of quality that is very, very good.",1261612800,3,1845,4.501492537313433

The punch line of the story (Dick's artificial intelligence and the question about human rights) and the very darkness of the shooting, in my opinion, gives this motion picture his unique style which is still standing after 27 years and I hope there will never be a remake! The props and dressing are very much 80's, but thats gives BR a cult film status.

I ordered this package because I wanted to see the different editions of BR from the past 25 years: the original, the directors cut, the final cut and the workprint AND the deleted scenes. This gives you an idea how Scott struggled with the story and I how he was forced to make certain decissions in regards of the demands of the studio. Is Deckard a replicant or not, you want a happy end or a more dark end, what happens with Rachel and the voice over from Ford. Maybe in the future this box come with a editor selector: you can make your own version of the BR story by selecting your own favourite scenes!

But to be honest, I'd rather have that than a swift, explosive, over-the-top adventure that's mixed with George Lucas and John Woo. This is one of Ridley Scott's masterpieces. The main reason why it's so great is the awe-inspiring style of the entire film. This is futuristic Los Angeles at its filthiest. There's smoke everywhere, the streets are always wet and dirty, and the hovering vehicles with searchlights would be a constant irritation if you're living on the top floor of an apartment building. But that's not the only thing that makes this film a magical experience. You also have Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" as an adaptation. The screenplay is drastically different than the original story, but at least the inspiriation is still there. Also, you have some incredible performances from Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, and James Edward Olmos. It's a very disturbing environment, so you can see that their characters are clearly affected by it. But Hauer could have at least been given an Oscar nomination; his performance here is probably the standout. His monologues give chills and tears. And this film has an actual message that involves the future, technology, and society in general. If you haven't seen this film yet, I won't spoil the message for you.

You can call it slow, and you can call it boring. I love it for what it is: a sci-fi noir masterpiece that's thankfully devoid of mindless action and loud techno music.",1253664000,,1567,4.913207547169812

If this does not interest you in the least, skip this, you are not the intended buyer. Just purchase the ""final cut"" DVD or BD disk and save some money.
If you are interested in the minutia associated with this magnificent production, buy this set today. It is well done and although the ""signed letter"" from Sir Ridley is nothing more than a piece of plastic (very cool, nonetheless) you do get a silver plastic origami unicorn that Gaff would be proud of included in this set.
The packaging is very neat but it is only fluff stuff and probably not of any particular value. The DVD's of all versions and the extras DVD's are worth the money. If that is not enough there are lovely pre-vis drawings from the artist responsible for the look of this strange future world of Los Angeles. These are suitable for framing should you wish.
The ""spinner toy car"" is also kind of neat but also a cheaply made toy. The jewel of this collection lies in the DVD's included and not the packaging but as far as I know this is the only way you can get the entire set of DVD's.

108692,5,0790729628,"After years of almost secret worship predominantly by sci fi fans, Blade Runner should be regarded finally by critics and mainstream movie fans alike as a masterpiece.

Blade Runner is a film best savored over multiple viewings. Happily, this DVD set (Four-Disc Collector's Edition) includes four different versions:

1982 Theatrical Cut (U.S.)
1982 International Cut
1992 Director's Cut
2007 Final Cut

Not to mention multiple commentaries (3) on the Final Cut.

Perhaps it is fitting that a movie which was so difficult to make (see ""Dangerous Days"" documentary) would take so much time to find the respect it deserves.

It's a detective story unlike others, and takes place in a future that seems very familiar. Unbelievably stellar supporting cast, and probably the last great special effects movie *not* to use CGI (and it's so much better for the use of in-camera FX).

On the 25th anniversary of the film's premiere, Warner, Ridley Scott, and just about everyone involved with the production worked together to produce this definitive release. There were 2-, 4-, and 5-disc collections available, and this 4-disc set is the best deal in my opinion. Much cheaper than the 5-disc extravaganza with all the props and goodies, it contains everything worthwhile with the exception of the workprint disc.

I won't ruin your enjoyment with talk about the differences among the different versions. But probably it's best to start with the Final Cut, then watch the documentary (DANGEROUS DAYS: MAKING BLADE RUNNER), then you can wade into the earlier cuts and also the commentaries.",1251849600,2,1581,5.176470588235294

108694,5,0790729628,"Bladerunner was based on Philip K. Dick's novel ""Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep"". Was Deckard (Harrison Ford) an Android too? This question was left unanswered, but various clues indicate that maybe he was an android, such as Deckard's unicorn dream matching up with the origami unicorn found at the end by Deckard. Did the police officer(Edward James Olmos) know something that Deckard didn't know about himself. One of the androids (Sean Young) asks point blank if he has ever given himself the test, but he never replies.

The 1968 novel is actually quite different from the movie in many ways, such as with the drug dependancy of the central characters in the novel. In the novel Decker and the rest of the human race is obsessed with collecting either real or lifelike robotic animals. In Decker's world it is considered a status symbol to own a real animal, but those without the financial means settle for robotic animals. All the while people are constantly regulating their feelings and emotions by plugging themselves into machines, thus the humans have developed a symbiotic relationship with machines just as advances are being made to create androids that are ever more human like. In this crossroads with the future humans and androids are virtually the same, but this threatens the humans' belief that they are unique. In this context androids have no rights, since androids are made by humans. Thus bounty hunters like Decker make their living chasing down runaway androids. In an ironic twist Decker kills these intelligent and emotional androids in order to buy a prized living animal.

This darkly atmospheric film establishes the stage for many other sci-fi movies to come. And in this blu-ray set we get the first theatrical versions (1982), plus the director's cut (1992), and now the final cut (2007), which has the Deckard voiceover deleted, as well as numerous never-before-seen shots, improved special effects, and added lines.

108699,2,0790729628,"Like many other movies that came out during the 1980s, I only recently watched Blade Runner, for the first time, a few years ago.  I guess that you can say that either I'm extremely naive...or have lived a very 'sheltered' life.

Before watching Blade Runner for the first time, I had the impression (based on countless reviews by critics and the general public) that it was one of the most underrated and greatest sci-fi movies of all time.  After having...'somehow' (*cough*) managed to force myself to watch the entire movie, my impression of the intelligence of mankind lowered exponentially -as it has many times in recent years, needless to say.

Blade Runner starts out as an eery sci-fi flic showing potential that it may well, indeed, turn out to paint a very original, accurate and ominous portrayal of the future: The futuristically-rendered city-scapes are very well done (even for the present year, 2009, they still don't look very dated), the synthesizer palettes by Vangelis create an ominous atmosphere that goes well with the beginning of the the movie...and some of the first scenes seem to suggest that the movie will be very futuristic and intellectual in a number of ways.  Once the miscast droning dialogue from Harrison Ford (who plays Rick Deckard, a detective who's narrative dialogue is supposed to sound intelligent, but comes across as that of a dumb rogue more befitting of Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark) enters the movie...it goes downhill...very quickly...

Rick Deckard's mission is to eliminate ""replicants.""  After the first half hour of the film (the only part of the film that has anything intellectual, thematic, or atmospheric going for it), the entire plot goes downhill very quickly and the remainder of the film focuses on Harrison Ford chasing replicants, being chased by replicants, and fighting replicants.  Instead of being awash with atmosphere, mystery, and futuristic city-renderings, the film is awash with sleazy '80s dance-fight choreography, dark-colored gothic make-up, and gore.  The dialogue and action from this point on is graphic, pointless, and pain-fully redundant...a pointless exercise in futility.  For THIS part of the movie (the majority of the film), Rutger Hauer is WONDERFULLY-CAST (as opposed to ""mis-cast"") as the proto-typical sleaze-gore '80s villain -something akin to a SUPER-rebellious Billy Idol...exept with MORE makeup and possessing decent fighting skills.  By the end of the movie, you're wondering why the heck did I spend two hours or so watching this sleaze-schlock nonsense...and what the hell was the purpose of it?

How the general public AND critics (look at the PLETHORA of 5-star reviews on this website, alone!) overwhelmingly rate this movie as even ""marginally-good""...much less ""GREAT""...is way beyond me...(or is it ""below"" me?).  Is there something about the opening music and city renderings of this film...that creates an atmosphere that 'stays' with them throughout the remainder of the film?  Is it that most people watched Blade Runner when it came out in 1982 (I only saw it for the first time ever recently), times were different, and although the movie is NOW wonderfully-dated and overrated, they still have the same impression of the movie?

In my opinion, Blade Runner isn't a ""terrible"" movie...but is certainly not good either, and a movie, which I believe can...and should be parodied...or at the very least submitted to Mystery Science Theater (for the take on Harrison Ford's 'dumb-sounding' dialogue narration, or Rutger Hauer's overtly-explicit sleaze antics, among others).  Based on the sheer number of high reviews that I've seen of this movie on nearly every major website, I would even go as far as to say that ""Blade Runner is the most overrated movie of all time.""",1249862400,4,3791,5.19016393442623

108733,3,0790729628,"All in all, Blade Runner is a passable film, a 65-70 out of 100 (mainly on the strength of its technical achievement), but nowhere is it near great, much less the masterpiece its fans claim. Like its source novel, it has a few good ideas, more bad ones, a thin plot, trite and leaden dialogue, and poor characterizations, made all the worse by mediocre to bad acting, from the always overrated Ford, to the abysmal Young, to the over the top Hauer (aptly demonstrated by his silly soliloquy) to the lifeless Hannah (both of whose portrayals do nothing to engender sympathy for the Replicants), to the quirk-infested Olmos. Add in the chemistry lacking love story between Ford and Young, and the far too long sequences designed to simply show off the visuals and inner workings of Tyrell's corporation, the muddled plot (especially in the later non-voiceover versions), and the film is a classic triumph of `style over substance.' Even that clich grates, despite its aptness. Granted, it would not surprise me if claimants of the Deckard as Relicant posit point to the chemistry lacking love story as proof that both characters are inhuman, but Occam's Razor points to the simpler interpretation that it's just bad acting and writing.

  Similarly, the overall film ultimately falls far short of its claimed greatness because it simply is never sure of what it wants to be- another strike against its `visionary' claims. It has too many feet on too many boats that diverge- is it sci fi, is it existential, is it film noir, is it a character study? In truth, it has elements of all these and more, but not enough of any of them to make it work as one, much less all of these. In fact, the chief failing, on all scores, for this film, is that Ridley Scott really had no vision for the project, grafting elements from Alien and many of the other films mentioned in this essay, trying to take what worked from each, and ending up with a film that, in many ways, is a mess, and a dull one, at that. Yes, it has plenty of visions, but no single vision; and in its own myopia, Blade Runner's dystopia founders.

108737,5,0790729628,"""Blade Runner"" is a very strange movie. I practically grew up with it. Everyone in Sweden seems to have seen it, and it used to be very popular, especially among women. Disjointed images of the movie have stayed with me ever since I first saw it: the dark alleys filled with Chinese, the owl, the marching dwarfs at J.F. Sebastian's home, the dying replicant who talks about Orion, Vangelis' music... When I saw ""The Final Cut"", I realized that I remembered all of the movie and most of the lines - and yet, I didn't remember the plot! Is this how an animal sees the world? A long succession of disconnected images, some weird, some pleasant, some threatening...but nothing to tie them together. Have I finally answered that old philosophical question: How does it feel to be a bat?

When I was younger, both my father and myself were *seriously* confused by another thing concerning ""Blade Runner"". Somehow, it seemed different every time we saw it! That was before I realized that there are several versions of the movie (seven versions, actually). My favourite version is still the original one, with Deckard's voice overs (""at that moment he loved life...all life...my life""), and where Deckard and Rachael get away at the end. Apparently, most people involved in making ""Blade Runner"" hated the original, which explains the long series of alternative versions.

According to Wikipedia, ""Blade Runner"" wasn't much of a success in the United States. Perhaps the movie contains too little action for an American audience? Frankly, it hasn't much of a plot either. The point of ""Blade Runner"", I think, is artistic. It's not really a movie. It's a work of art, a piece of poetry on the widescreen. The strange but beautiful music by Vangelis underlines this. Perhaps that's why Ridley Scott insisted on constantly remaking ""Blade Runner"". He saw it as more than a commercial movie. It's his private little painting or symphony. Indeed, this might be why ""Blade Runner"" affected me the way it did: I never remembered the storyline, since it's not really important, but I did remember the images, the atmosphere, the strange characters...

For those who never seen ""Blade Runner"", here's a short summary of the plot (with spoilers). The main character, Deckard, is a police officer specialized in killing robots known as replicants. The robots look exactly like humans, and are used as slave labour or involuntary soldiers on distant planets. Some of the replicants escape from captivity and turn up in California. During Deckard's mission to intercept and kill them, he realizes that Rachael, the woman he loves, is also a replicant, but unaware of the fact. The police want Deckard to kill Rachael as well. Deckard refuses. In some versions of the movie, he and Rachael gets away, while in other versions, their ultimate fate remains uncertain. In ""The Final Cut"", it's even implied that Deckard himself might be a replicant!

But, as I said, the plot is really the least interesting part of this production. Deckard is actually a quite incompetent cop! What makes ""Blade Runner"" so fascinating are the strange people, the ambivalence of the robots (are they evil? or just misunderstood?), the dark alleys, the music...

Incidentally, this is a review of the ""5 disc complete collectors' edition"". I don't have it, but judging by the editorial review, it contains all seven versions of this intriguing film...",1247875200,4,3410,4.975438596491228

108829,3,0790729628,"First of all I seen this movie for the first time in 1982 when it aired on HBO. Of course it was the version with Deckerd's voice over. I loved it for it's original  style of music, sets, characters and mood. Then in 1992 they released the Directors cut and I was excited about seeing it. I was hoping for scenes of Roy Batty's life on off world, like what he described to Deckard at the end of the film. Or more story on Deckard's past, which would of help telling if Deckard is a replicant or not. What we got was a scene of a unicorn an the voice over eliminated. I again enjoyed this version of the film to but like I said I was hoping for more. Then in 2007, they released this 4 version set with plenty of behind the scenes goodies. I just purchased this set about a week ago and I am glad I bought it for less than half of the original price. Once again I was hoping to see more never before seen scenes, especially since there was a version called the final cut included..If you count less than a minute of scene variance difference between the U.S. version, the U.K. version and the directors cut worthy of seeing it 4 times. The minor changes on these three versions were so insignificant, they made no change in the story or mood of the film.  I watched the extras and what surprised me was, several times they mentioned this film was almost 4 hours long before the editing was done. You would think with an extra 2 hours of film that was not used they could have given us an almost complete new version of this movie. I was impressed with the cleanup of the films making for better picture and sound than the first release of them years ago. This movie, set new standards in movie making with dark sets and music that set the mood of the story telling. It was not widely accepted in 82, but over the years with the help of video tape and then dvd it found cult status. I just hope one day soon they decide to use the unused footage to give us a truly alternate version to the 82 release.

108858,4,0790729628,"I'm one of those purists who wants to see things in their original form, no matter how ""improved"" they may have become over time. For that reason, I chose to watch the Theatrical Cut of Blade Runner first, because I figured this is the way it was meant to be seen before the tinkering began.

There are two main differences that I know of: the voice-overs exist in the original, but not the Director's Cut; and the original has a happier, more hopeful ending than the Director's Cut.

Ironically, I found both of these things in the Theatrical Cut very distracting and out-of-place. In fact, the voice-overs really only exist in four or five small points during the first hour of the movie (and one at the end) and I don't feel like they really add to the story. There was one specific moment when a character used a term and I figured out the definition on my own, but then Harrison Ford's voice came on the screen explaining the term. Very unnecessary.

Similarly, where the movie ends in the Director's Cut is exactly where I thought it was going to end in the Theatrical Cut, and yet it kept going. The message that we take from that original ending is basically the same as the message conveyed in the final words of the movie, so again the scene was unnecessary.

Finally, I just read that Ridley Scott filmed the original movie *without* the voice-overs or the extra final scene, but the studio felt (as they tend to do) that the voice-overs were needed to help the audience understand what was going on, and naturally they wanted a happier ending.

The movie itself is great, and I think it's probably even better without the voice-overs and the original ending. Anyone who says otherwise has either given it real thought (admirable) or simply wants to like the original better than any altered version (not as admirable).

So my point is, if you are trying to decide which version to watch, I recommend the Director's Cut (assuming nothing else major has changed in it) simply because that was the real vision of the director, and in my opinion what it leaves out actually makes the movie better.",1233446400,2,2105,4.6

A future that looked very believable like the visual-effects shots of the flying car going over a futuristic city... The fight sequence doesn't prepare you for the traumatic emotional side that there is in the film, it leaves you sort of broken...

There is a beautiful, delicate emotional great scene that I remember when I first saw the movie... I'm in the theater and I'm so drawn in what Rutger Hauer's doing... I'm so drawn in by what the theme of the movie has brought us to... The magnificent moment where he is letting go of life... And in those last moments of letting go of life he's really learned to appreciate life to the point where he spares Deckard's life, and where he's even holding a white dove because he just wants to have something that's alive in his hands... It's an amazing sort of crescendo that's going and there's Rutger saying: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. All these moments will be lost in time like tears in rain."" Hauer puts all the things that are so amazing about people: sense of poetry, sense of humor, sense of sexuality, sense of the kid, sense of soul...

Scott brought out the best qualities in his performers... He coaxed and very gently manipulated performances from his actors that in some instances I think they've rarely topped... You feel the story, you feel the emotions of the characters and you will be lost in the middle of this wild world, you know, it's so rich and it's painful... I mean it's a very bluesy, dark story and told very compassionately...

The overpopulation, the sort of crowd scenes is so rich and varied and there's such an extreme detail designing the magazine covers, designing the look of the punks, the Hare Krishnas, the biological salesman, everything is designed... You have just Piccadilly Circus punks walking by... You have a sense of layers in that society... That is one of those things that you see again and again... The city landscape with the big billboards  la Kyoto or Tokyo... Scott was able to create the look based on what goes on in various cities all over the world... Whether it is Tokyo, Kyoto or Beijing or Hong Kong or whatever, you're right in ""Blade Runner"" country...

""Blade Runner,"" to me, embodies the elegance, the power, and the uniqueness of a film experience... It's the most classical, beautiful, purest movie-making writing and then the film-making itself is... The images and the sound and the music, it's pure cinema... Ridley came out with an amazing, brilliantly executed future of an absolute dystopia... The intensity of his perfectionism on ""Blade Runner"" made the movie...

108866,5,0790729628,"***This review covers the Blu-Ray set***

THE FILM

A somewhat loose adaptation of Philip K. Dick's short story, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a half detective story, half sci-fi film.

Blade Runner was probably one of the most expensive experimental films of all time.  It is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful, coming from a photographer, those words cary a good deal of meaning.  While as a story or even some of the performances,  don't always fire on all cylinders, there is a certain mystery and  powerful visual majesty to fill any lapses in dramatic pitch.

Ridley Scott cut his teeth as a filmmaker on commercials and watching Jordan Cornenweth's powerful cinematography, one definitely feels Blade Runner is a sort of commercial.  For what, we just don't know.  Sure there are meditations on humanity, inevitability and choice, but there isn't a real cohesive exploration or dialogue on any of these subjects.  I think this ambiguity is probably the main reason Blade Runner has been such an  enduring journey.  For sure, there are genuinely tender, magical and powerful moments to the film.  In short, Blade Runner is what it is. It is a film that the viewer takes home what they bring to it.

THE QUALITY

I have owned several DVD and VHS releases of the movie through the years as many others and much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this Blu-Ray release provs how lucky we are to have High Def.  On my 42"" plasma, the film is rapturous.  The shafts of light and the blue hues really make you feel as if your peering into the world before you.  The blues are deep and the contrast is strong.

There is grain and some missed focus, but the challenges the crew must have had shooting Panavision anamorphic in those days with such little light at times must have been a real challenge for the focus pullers.  If anything, on the grain, it only enhances the film's gritty feel.  Neither of these small observations have any real impact on the picture's quality or overall sharpness.

Having upgraded to High-Def relatively recently, I have the same set for DVD and going back and fourth, there are some scenes that show a real hike in quality and detail.  This is one of those films where you watch it and aren't always conscious of the difference between HD and SD UNTIL you go back and watch the SD.  You really find it is impossible to go back. I'm glad I made the purchase.

CONCLUSION

Like most great films, Blade Runner is not for everybody.  It is a supreme exercise in production and photography over drama, but that hasn't made the film any less powerful.  It was worth every penny to pick this up and it is easily one of the best releases you can get on HD right now.",1231891200,2,2726,4.609147609147609
108867,5,0790729628,"Yes, it's been tough finding a copy of Blade Runner that has the narration. Which is the only reason I bought this set. But, at least I did wait until it was on sale. I realize Ridley Scott claims the newest version is what he really intended, but I'll take the side of the studio on this one. Blade is a very dark, slow moving movie. I find the narration to be helpful in moving the story along, and important in giving insights into what Decker was thinking at any given moment. I was very surprised Scott didn't like or endorse it. Then, after sitting through this dark slow film, I think we deserve a happy ending. After all, aren't all fairy tales supposed to have happy endings and what's wrong with that? The Decker character certainly deserved it, didn't he? We did...

I think a lot of times, directors get a little full of themselves from past successes (ie. Aliens) and forget the focus of a film is for people to actually want to go see it. All these many, many versions of this film, to me, only amount to milking the cow for all it's worth, not from any deeper insight. I believe the changes the studio demanded were right on the money and as a result, we're all here having this discussion. I don't believe Ridley's newest version would have resulted in the cult hit Blade Runner was to become. Studios know what sells, directors don't neccesarily. See Gene Roddenbury and Star Trek 1, vs. 2, The Wrath of Khan. The first was Gene's and the second was the studios. While I like Star Trek the Motion Picture, there absolutely No comparison to The Wrath of Khan.

Back to Blade; the International version is very nice. While the sound is spot on excellent, the video transfer isn't near as good as I would have liked to have seen however. It almost looks like a dubbed video tape actually. Much like they stuck it in this set because they had to give you as many disks as they could for the high price they were asking. If you use zoom 1 to get rid of the black bars, it's readily apparent how lacking the transfer is. But, it's not bad and well worth the buy if you're a fan; especially if you don't like the direction Ridley Scott took the movie.",1231632000,,2161,4.359801488833747
108868,5,0790729628,"This is an excellent movie, even though its more than just a few years old now. All the different versions (four) and as well as a workprint is included on the discs. Im not really sure about how many hours of documentary footage is contained, but I have seen about 4,5 hours so far and there is still more.

I knew before watching this that making a movie is really complicated and now I got even a further study into that. The various film versions and deleted scenes puts me in the directiors sitiuation on how to choose what should have been included or not. Yes, yes, of course my own choice would probably differ a tiny bit from the five versions Ive seen - still its a great movie.

I have three previous copies of this movie in various packages. I place this movie in my personal top ten list. This Blu-ray 5 disc collectors addition is a rather poor repackage that obviously had the minimum of effort put into it. Disc one is extremely poor rendition with very low quality color and green bands running through it on both the top and bottom. The ""Directors Cut"" is a copy of the standard definition print of a copy already in electronic archive. Color intensity in this copy is wanting but not as poor as the ""Final Cut"". I was hoping this would rise above but there was no effort to reproduce a high quality product. The standard def 5 disc set is much better quality. My guess is the Studio no longer has access to a high quality ""master"".

It turned out to be a lot different than i expected. The film was on a smaller scale than i expected. The setting of the film was less important than the story unfolding in it. Admittedly i didn't like it as much as i was expecting but it was still really good. Even though the style or genre of the film was different than i was expecting i liked it for that very reason. The way i look at it there are the films that have extraordinary settings and the plot sort of shows it off. Star Wars is a good example of this. The plot involved many aspects of the setting like light speed travel and large space wars. Blade Runner on the other hand was simply a detective story that just happened to take place in the future. Most of the events in the story could very easily happen now. Again, i didn't like it as much as i thought i would but i liked it a lot, just in a different way i was expecting.

Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc ""Complete Collector's Edition"" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.

I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter.  The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic.  Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder.""

I can see where people would watch this film mulitple times and enjoy it very much each time.  The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" That's good enough for me.  The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions,  including the original theatrical release with Harrison Ford doing  narration, like out of a late `40s film noir....so I am anxious to hear that - and this time, appreciate this movie.

108908,5,0790729628,"'Bladerunner' is one of the greast Sci-Fi movies ever.  It depicts a future both technically sophisticated but, at the same time, a morally degraded freak show.  After so many great reviews I'll make no effort to condense this great film.  The action revolves around the fact that technology has evolved to the point that it can produce artificial humans, or 'Skin Jobs', as they are contemptuously known.  These individuals are basically biological robots but, instead of machinery, they are composed totally of human tissue.  They have been produced with different purposes in mind and, in the film, we see...in the several 'Skin Jobs' depicted...advancing levels of technology.  The most advanced model is 'Roy', blonde, powerful, beautiful and deadly [here we see a reflection of Nazi superman theory].

Unfortunately, all models, because of their perceived danger to the human race, have an inbuilt defect--they are limited to a very short life.  They are sentient enough to resent it and active enough to do something about it.  Four escape to earth to try to gain the secret of longer life.  It's a desperate ploy, especially because Harrison as the 'Bladerunner' has been commissioned to destroy them.  Great stuff really and better yet because no one has yet been wrong enough to try to serialize this great film.

108931,2,0790729628,"Back in December, we listed our ""8 Coolest Sci-Fi Flicks"" and got some heat for not including ""Blade Runner"" (1982) on the list. We remembered Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's science fiction classic ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" as being a disappointment - as well as a bit heavy-handed.

We recently revisited ""Blade Runner"" to see if the sands of time had softened our opinion of the movie. But we also wanted to see if Scott's director's cut version of the film would improve it.

It did, but our opinion of ""Blade Runner"" remains mediocre.

We agree with film critic Roger Ebert: ""Watching the director's cut (of ""Blade Runner""), I am left with the same overall opinion of the movie: It looks fabulous, it uses special effects to create a new world of its own, but it is thin in its human story.""

Ebert gets this one right. ""Blade Runner"" is slick on production. The special effects are so impressive that Scott lets them take over parts of the movie as he pans the camera back to take in breathless shots of his futuristic version of Los Angeles. The movie, at times, is in awe of itself.

We'll give Scott credit here. He does a magnificent job in crafting his world. It's a bleak one, but it resonates as realistic: the driving, black rains, the pollution-scarred skies, the blinking, moving billboards, the strange fashions, and the crowds of vampire like citizens.

But this is all background.

The rest of the movie doesn't live up to the set. The plot is achingly mediocre and stolen from half-a-dozen film noir movies. It relies on characters hand-picked from central castings old stereotypes closet.

The usually dynamic Harrison Ford is wasted here. Ford sleepwalks through the role of a world-weary police officer who quits to crawl inside a whiskey bottle. But predictably his crusty, insensitive boss calls him back for one last job. Then there is Sean Young as the femme fatale - smoking cigarettes and looking both confused and earnest at the same time.

Ford plays Deckard -- a blade runner (a police officer assigned to hunt down and kill ""replicants"" also known as cyborgs). The replicants are illegal on earth and only used on other planets for jobs too dangerous for real human beings. It's never explained why the replicants are not allowed on earth (can't we all just get along?).

The movie carefully avoids another major problem: if they are illegal on earth then why are the replicants designed to look exactly like human beings? They are also designed to look differently from each other - no two are alike. In fact, the only way to tell a replicant from a real human being is to take a complicated oral exam which takes about 45 minutes to an hour to administer.

Wouldn't it be easier to design the replicants with blue skin, for example? Or make them all look exactly alike? That way they couldn't escape and hide among the population of real humans. Seems like an easy fix especially since the replicants have become such a dangerous nuisance that it's necessary to create the job of blade runner to hunt down and kill them.

But then, of course, we wouldn't have a movie.

Another problem with the replicants is that they only last four years -but no one - not the replicants or their creators - seems to readily know the expiration dates. Given that the replicants are used for dangerous off-world work wouldn't it be prudent to know when they ""die""? After all wouldn't it be a disaster to send replicants on a mission and have them start expiring halfway through?

Deckard is assigned to kill four replicants that murdered a shuttle full of people and now are hiding out in LA. His investigation is riddled with holes and convenient consequences that only happen in movie scripts (he finds a tiny snake scale in the bathroom tub of an old haunt which lead him, of course, to a stripper who uses a snake in her act. She happens to be one of the replicants). He even calls them at their secret hideout and... they answer the phone.

We were also amazed at how Deckard never ever calls for back-up - even when he finally locates the replicants' hide-out and knows he will be up against two super powerful androids that have already murdered more than 20 people.

""Blade Runner"" wants to be a film about the definition of humanity - an action flick with a philosophy. But it fails in both aspects. It spends too little time exploring the idea of manufactured life being real life because the characters don't really care about the answer. And the action sequences aren't even as good as the average fare on TV.

108935,5,0790729628,"Remember that scene at the end of `The Silence of the Lambs' where Clarice is in the creepy old house and you just know that Wild Bill is lurking around every dusty corner?  Remember how your heart all but stopped while the scene was running, how you gripped the arm rests in fear as you told yourself over and over again that it was all going to end well; that Clarice was going to get the bad guy and save the girl and whatever else you had to tell yourself in order to make it through?

Gather those feelings and relish in them, because that is precisely what every moment of `Blade Runner' feels like.

The film takes place in the near future (eleven years to be exact) in the year 2019.  Man has created an equal to themselves, human clones known as replicants, who, equipped with fixed life-spans, can work in the colonies outside of Earth.  When a bloody mutiny breaks out these replicants are labeled illegal.  When a few of these clones escape their Off-World Colony by stealing a ship and make their way to Earth, an ex-Blade Runner (police officers dispatched to hunt down and terminate replicants) named Deckard is asked to come back into the game in order to get rid of them.

The kicker with the film, and really what makes it so much more than just a science fiction/action film is the fact that the replicants don't know that they are not human.  They are practically human (except they are not programmed to express human emotion, although they have the capability to learn how to) and so they fear death just as much as you or I.

If one looks at `Blade Runner' simply as an action film or a science fiction masterpiece they are bound to be satisfied.  As far as run of the mill blockbusters are concerned, Scott's visionary epic is at the top of the pack; by a long shot.  It is beautifully shot, it is fast paced and thrilling.  The acting is actually very good considering the genre and the usual messy performances that come with.  But, if you take a minute to look at `Blade Runner' as something deeper than all that you come to experience an entirely different and ultimately more rewarding film.  Yes, if you dissect the humanity captures within the films core you will find a very thought provoking film that gropes at our very feelings towards life and death.

I remember recalling Sean Penn's devastating words at the end of `Dean Man Walking', where he said that killing is never okay.

Instant chills.

`Blade Runner' has a style that is probably the films greatest focal point.  To say that Ridley Scott (totally snubbed of an Oscar) is the star of the show is an understatement.  The film is like a really gritty `Fifth Element' with enough horror and even a little noir thrown in for good measure.  Scott effortlessly pans across a universe that seems strangely distant yet almost too real.  We can see ourselves there even if we don't want to.  My best friend told me that `Blade Runner' is his favorite film because it seems too probable.

Harrison Ford is brilliantly cast, lending the film his masculine charm.  Rutger Haur is terrifying yet overtly sympathetic at the films end, and Sean Young is devastatingly powerful as Rachael, the `special' replicant who is coming to terms with her own reality.  Daryl Hannah also turns in a great performance as Pris, a beautiful replicant who is as dangerous as she is intoxicating.

Everything about `Blade Runner' is stunning, from the set pieces to the actors who inhabit them, and to judge a film on pure surface value alone would place this picture towering above many; but when you add the satisfying substance that marks this films core you can see why `Blade Runner' is considered one of the greatest films of all time.

This collection of disk will give you everything you wanted ever know and see about the making of Blade Runner.
There is also a disc with some delete scenes, alternate endings and several documentary on the production of the movie which will reveal many anedocts that are very interesting. The documentary will reveal that the movie production was extremely under budget for how it was intended to be shot by Riddley Scott and he had to make so many compromises to get it to the end. Too bad they did not have a budget on the line of many of today's Hollywood productions.
The ""final cut"" blue ray disk, has an incredible quality. The film has been restored and I think colors and sharpness of the images has been enhanced using the latest digital technologies because the clarity and saturation of the colors is much better than any other version seen on disk or in theater.

There are five discs, one which is just a documentary (Dangerous Days) chronicling the entire creation of the film. The other discs are different iterations of the same film, but they have their differences.

I'm not reviewing the movie (plenty of those around) but the disc content itself!!! As seen on my Philips 60"", 1080i HDTV. And heard on My Polk Audio speakers powered by my Luxmann 400 Watts(RMS) Amp.

-Main disc (2007 Remaster)
-Video- 10/10 Great remaster. Sharp image. No film grain. Excellent contrast.
-Audio- (Dolby 5.1) 9/10 I would have given it 10 but I didn't get the chance to listen to it very loud and I'm afraid since this is a 1982 recording, some tape hiss might still be present. Although if you juge by the way they restored the image, the sound may be perfect as well.
-Extras- 10/10 Includes 3 earlier versions of the film and 3 dvd full of extras... You couldn't possibly want more unless you wear ""Blade Runner"" jammies to bed and have a cardboard cut-out of Harisson Ford in your bedroom...

-Alternate (early) movie releases disc- 3 versions of the movie on one disc. A very interesting concept. Please permit me a short editorial note on the subject. Why not do the same but adapted to ratings instead? Take an ""R"" rated movie but decide to watch the ""PG"" version with the kids automaticaly skipping over the nudity and extreme violent parts of some scenes? These parts are usualy there only as an ""entertainment"" value anyway and generaly don't bring a lot to the plot. Think about it!

OK back to ""Blade Runner"" Alternate (early) movie releases disc- 3 versions of the movie on the same disc-
-Video- 8/10 Film grain can be seen. Contrast and sharpness not as ggod as main disc.
-Audio- 7/10 Good for a 1982 recording

108958,5,0790729628,"Back in the day when DVD was in it's infancy one of the very first films I purchased was Blade Runner. I told myself that I would not buy it again till a High Definition version appeared. And here it is in all it's 5 disc glory.  Anybody who has a remote interest in film can't help but have this movie in their collection. It really is a true classic that helped define a genre, and is the bench mark to which many films seem to aspire. It's art direction characters and story are second to none and yet for a time it seemed we would never see the film that Ridley Scott intended. The production was fraught from the outset with script changes, the production losing its backers and studio meddling that led to a compromised film being shown in cinemas the first time round. Time however and hind sight has seen fit to bless Blade Runner and it's visionary director with cult status and we now have the final cut of the film approved by Ridley Scott himself.

Apart from the Final Cut of the movie this box set features all versions of the film that you could possibly want including the fabled and rarely seen Workprint. So for completists this box set is a must. I found the documentary Dangerous Days fascinating and it's a real eye opener to see how far ahead of it's time this film was. Indeed when you look at the budget this film had and what went on screen it's hard to see how todays movies cost the millions they do.

It goes without saying that the picture and audio quality of this movie are reference. When you have seen this movie on free to air ,dvd or even vhs it's like your getting a mere glimpse of the beauty this film has to offer. And if ever there was a movie that was worth the revisionist treatment then this one is it. Some people bemoan the fact that directors are now going back and digitally altering their movies and I have my reservations. Here the alterations are for the most part subtle and are there to enhance the quality of the presentation, to bring it up to date, and to fix stuff that just wasn't able to be fixed at the time it was made. But who cares with this 5 disc set you can have whichever movie you prefer. Who knows you might get to like a different version.

108972,5,0790729628,"Finally, BR fans can watch ALL FIVE different versions of this movie.

I longed for seeing the ""International"" cut again, after having viewed it repeatedly on cable in the 80's.  This version has a few more violent scenes than the theatrical version.  It also has the narration by Harrison FOrd, which I personally liked b/c it gave the film a friendlier feel, made Deckard almost certainly ""human"", and has the so-called ""happy ending"".

The Final Cut is great technically b/c the audio & video are enhanced & updated with modern technology that makes it a pleasure to watch & hear.  However, this version makes fairly clear that Deckard was indeed a replicant, which is a notion I initially scoffed at & rejected.  However, when director Ridley Scott says, in the commentary track & elsewhere in the DVD set, that his intention was to have Deckard be a replicant, then that's the way it is.  If you can accept this fact, then you will LOVE the Final Cut version of BR.

If you still prefer Deckard be a human, then you can still enjoy the 1982 International Version.

The other discs are excellent, discussing the making of BR, the cult status it has achieved, etc.  Nothing but great background & interviews throughout this DVD set.

The 5th disc gives you a 5th version of BR which, although of poor visual quality, has some different scenes in it & different dialogue.

108989,5,0790729628,"By now, you can find plenty of reviews of the content of this phenomenal Blu-Ray set, so go to them if you're looking for depth, as this is just a brief review to commend Warner for FINALLY putting this five-disc set into a standard-sized Blu-Ray case (though it's NOT shown in the customer images provided for this listing).

Received my second copy of this title in late July after picking it up during the $14.99 sale price, and was quite relieved to find a case no wider than 14mm thick! The previous ""double-wide"" was around 22-23mm, a full centimeter wider, and while that wasn't exactly hefty, it still smacked of unnecessarily making the product ""seem"" bigger than it needed to be because of the importance of the film within.

Basically, the construction of this new case is the same as the old: two flip trays on hinges, with an additional disc mounted on a hub on the inside back of the case. Only now, the flip trays are thin enough to fit in a Blu case that's only a millimeter or so wider than the standard-issue single-disc case.

I can only hope that ALL future Blu releases of up to five discs would consider a case like this. In an age where storage for the average DVD enthusiast -- esepcially the kind that collects titles like this one -- is at a premium, the less packaging, and ""air"", the better.

No guarantees you'll actually get this package when you order, as the double-wide case appears to be out there concurrently with this new one, and you're liable to get either from Amazon, so it's at least something to keep an eye peeled for should you choose to buy this in the store.",1217635200,2,1605,4.486301369863014

Okay, so I am a Blade Runner fan. I love just about everything about this movie, and seeing it back when it came out was a formative experience for a young movie fan. Consequently, I won't even attempt to review the movie as such, since it wouldn't be very even-handed or rational anyway. Bascially, if you are already a Blade Runner fan, you know, and if not, I suppose all I can say is that I kinda recommend to watch it at least once.

So, now that we are among ourselves, what about this edition. Well, it's great, it's what fans have been waiting for, it's well-made, contains all the relevant editions of the movie that matter (including, of course, the ""final"" one), plus a few gimmicks that will only be appreciated by die hard fans. The quality of sound and video is what you would expect it to be, i.e. great.

Many years later, it has become a cult favorite, and I can see why, but, I believe its only going to appeal to a ""certain type of audience"" The movie looks fantasic, and the visuals are well done for a film from the early 80's. The flim doesnt use action as its key, but tons of dialogue and there a tons of hidden meanings in the film (which I had to look up) which at times make it confusing and a bit to over-whelming for a sci-fi movie. This will appeal to certain types, but please don't think this is a sci-fi action film, because it isnt. The first  50 minutes have no action, and the movie as a whole is just to dark and to over-complex for someone like myself who is only an average sci-fi fan. This was my first viewing of the film, so I decided on the directors cut, which I don't know if this might have made things more confusing for me, since I have read there is a big difference between the DC and the theatrical version. I also hear there are many different cuts of the film. I still appricate somethings that are done here, and that is why I give the film credit.  This is the first time that I have praised a film so much that I hated (well most of it) This isn't some piece of trash,(once again why I couldn't give it one star) it has been praised by many film critics, but once again, there was nothing in this that tickled my fancy. Be warned that this is a complex movie you are getting yourself into, U might love it, but I think for an average fan of sci-fi with an over-complex plot, it is only a C-.

I have always been a fan of the original theatrical version and unfortunately was only released on the laserdisc format under the criterion collection prior for the North American market.

The visuals are stunning. The first sequence on a blu-ray player and a 1080p television will simply take your breath away.

Just one glitch: they did not remove the awful cables taking the car up when it is raining; in this digital time, it would have been easy to remove; especialy that they re-shot the scene of the snake lady being shot (you were able to make out quite easily it was a man in a 'lady suit'); they should have done this one too.

But hey, that's me... Otherwise, absolutely stunning. The one Blu-Ray that is not computer-animated that is worth every single penny.

(Note: This review is for the movie ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"" (2 disc special edition) released in 2007.)

This movie is based on the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" (1968) by Philip K. Dick (1928 to 1982).

This movie depicts a dystopian (opposite of a utopia) Los Angeles in the year 2019 in which genetically manufactured beings called ""replicants"" (visually indistinguishable from adult humans) are used for dangerous and degrading work on Earth's off-world colonies.

Following a small replicant (also called a ""skin-job"") uprising, replicants become illegal on Earth and specialist police called ""blade runners"" are trained to hunt down and ""retire"" (kill) escaped replicants trespassing on Earth.

Besides the plot, this movie seems to forecast important concerns of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries such as overpopulation, globalization, climate change, and genetic engineering.

The plot of this movie is simple.  Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a semi-retired blade runner who's after four ruthless replicants illegally on Earth named Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), Pris (Daryl Hannah), and Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer).  Deckard accidentally develops a romance with the more sophisticated replicant Rachael (Sean Young).

I watched this movie (""The Final Cut"" which is essentially the same as the rushed ""The Director`s Cut"") with a friend who did not see the original theatrical release that had Deckard's voice-over narration.  Guess what?  My friend could not follow the story!!!  I could since I'd seen the original release but I found that I still missed Deckard's voice-over.

I especially missed the voice-over when the Roy Batty replicant ""dies"" at the end of the movie.  This key scene was not as emotionally appealing with the voice-over absent.

I think I deduced the reasons why the voice-over is so important to this movie:

(1) It allows the viewer to follow the action
(2) It provides the human and emotional touch to counterbalance all the technological and visually-stunning special effects
(3) It adds a ""retro"" feel that reminded me of old-time detective movies
(4) The story drags without it.

Thus, the obvious question is, ""Why wasn't there an option to have the voice-over?""  Answer: I don't know but it may have to do with marketing.  By having such an option, those who feel the voice-over is integral to the movie would have been satisfied.

The ending of the final cut, I felt, was too abrupt.  The original ending gave the feeling that Deckard and the replicant Rachael would have a future together.

The special effects that highlight the steel-and-microchip jungle of twenty-first century L.A. and the background music provided by Vangelis are still fantastic and exhilarating.

The final cut has about a minute more of extended scenes and never before seen special effects than the original theatrical version and the director's cut.  The entire movie has been digitally restored making the images clean and crisp.  The audio is excellent.  There is a thirty second introduction by director Ridley Scott and three audio commentaries.  The second disc has a three and a half hour documentary making it perhaps the ""definitive"" documentary for fans of this movie.

BOTTOM  LINE:

Without the voice-over narration, this movie (The Final Cut) loses its magnificence and emotional impact.

RECOMMENDATION:

Get the four or five disc ""Collector's Edition"" where one disc has the original theatrical released version (that easily is a five-star movie) with Deckard's voice-over narration.  This will, unfortunately, cost you more money.

Of course here you get both of these versions, plus several others, in a sharp-looking HD transfer, plus loads of extras, for just over 20 bucks.  It's hard to go wrong, especially with one of the great early masterpieces of cyberpunk cimema, and probably the best film adaptation of a Philip K.

The Final Cut, has some interesting additions, ""I want more life, f..ker"" is now changed to ""I want more life, father"".  And the dove shot at the end, is now in keeping with the dark city background.  Some of the gore is unnecessarily lengthened imho.

109040,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner has been one of my all-time sci-fi favorites. I bought the Director's Cut DVD several years ago because it was the only economical choice available. Like with some other DVD releases it was basic. Just the movie, and some cast/crew notes, plus the trailer. I wanted the commentary for it so badly. Maybe some extras.

I had heard some discussion a few years ago about the idea of coming out with another release, with commentary and extras, but there were doubts whether it would come together. There were particular doubts about Harrison Ford's participation, since the lore was there was some real bad blood between him and Ridley Scott, because of what happened during the production of Blade Runner. Well, Harrison chose not to disappoint. He's interviewed in the extras. I'm glad to see that! This release is just about everything I wanted.

The first disc has the ""final cut"" version of the movie. It turns out Ridley Scott actually shot a little footage in 2007 to fix it up! It has Scott's commentary, along with two other commentary tracks: production/writers, and design/special effects crew. The latter includes commentary by ""Visual Futurist"" Syd Mead.

The second disc has ""Dangerous Days: The Making of Blade Runner"", a 3.5-hour documentary on all aspects of the film, from when it was just Hampton Fancher's idea, to the final release. Among those interviewed are the director Ridley Scott, the writers Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, actors Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh, Morgan Paull, Daryl Hannah, Joe Turkel, Joanna Cassidy, James Hong, the producers, the financiers, and the special effects crew (including Syd Mead). It was more than I could ever want in a ""making of"" extra. Great job. Interspersed throughout this documentary are clips of bloopers and deleted scenes. This was the only thing I wish they had separated out.

This 2-disc set does not contain a ""deleted scenes"" feature. The most significant deleted scene that I've seen in crappy online video is where Deckard comes to visit Holden in the hospital after he was shot by Leon. Clips of this deleted scene are in the documentary, but it's not available on its own.

I like seeing deleted scenes because sometimes they can provide insights into the story. Even so I can't be disappointed with this release. Like I said, it's more than what I hoped for in my wildest dreams. It's wonderful!",1214092800,,2435,4.958333333333333

I bought my original BladeRunner dvd back in 1999 and it is a truly terrible transfer. I viewed it once and has sat on my shelf, and continued to use my 20 year old vhs copy.

I was looking forward to bluray releases in the hope the studios would get their act together. Have ordered the 5 disk collectors edition, and waiting for it to arrive. Before I get hold of the disks, I discover the special features are standard dvds, not bluray disks.

It is not clear on the sleeve, or on the details on the web sites. Sure, Bluray players will play standard dvds, but all the hidef tvs are terrible at playing standard def footage.

So not doubt Warner wanted to get this release out of the door, and skimped on coverting the extras; more likely just padded the release with dvds as they are cheaper to produce. I hate this messing about, only to see a year or two from now, they re-release the set with what should have been there in the first place.

I really don't see any point in buying this stuff anymore, much better to rent with all the re-release of material all the time.",1214006400,4,1196,4.255506607929515

109045,5,0790729628,"This review focuses on the DVD box set- simply put, Blade Runner is one of the best and most influential Sci-Fi movies of all time. If you need a more thorough review, you can check elsewhere as there are many others.

As for this boxed set, this is simply the best-ever printing of Blade Runner yet made. The primary things you get:

-All prints of the movie. From the original theatrical release (with the narration), to the new ""Final Cut"", you get every major take on the movie ever released. Each print also has an introduction from Ridley Scott, where he spends a couple minutes talking about what's unique to the specific print, and what that print happened.
-A ton of special features. From the original featurettes made decades ago to the new ""Dangerous Days""- a massive look at every aspect of the film that fills an entire DVD on its own, and is well worth watching if you're a deep enough fan to wade though it all.
-The film (the ""Final Cut"" version) has 3 commentaries of varying natures, from Ridley Scott who talks mostly about budgets and his craft, to the special effects people who talk more about fellowship on the set and go light on technical bits. All of the commentaries are worth hearing for various reasons.

On the ""Final Cut""- Love it or hate it, this is the version of the film Ridley Scott had always wanted to make but that studios never allowed him to. There is no narration, there is the more melancholoy ending instead of the happy ending from the theatrical release, and best of all a few scenes that before had some technical errors have been remastered. Unlike other recent revisits, the director hasn't added in CG dewbacks or replaced puppets with computerized monstrocities- real technical errors like overly obvious stunt doubles were corrected as they should have been.

If you're a fan of this movie, this set contains everything you've ever wanted. It contains your favorite print of the film (regardless of what print that ends up being- they're all here). It contains so much behind the scenes material that they had to split it between several DVDs. There are even details down to screen tests included- this set has everything.

109059,4,0790729628,"I can't add much to the collection of reviews here, though I must recommend that the serious sci-fi movie fan actually read through them, they're entertaining themselves.  I loved the original in the theaters, I do like this newest version with the narration edited out, and the inconsistent happy ending edited out, but still, it's impossible to relive the wonderful experience of seeing the first run of Bladerunner back then, for many reasons.  But at the same time, there's no real fair comparison between this movie, and the thought provoking, prescient, brilliant literary quality novels of Phillip K. Dick, and ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" was one of his best.  A big hole in the logic of the movie should have been, given a future with an overpopulation and urban poverty problem, why would big, powerful, monopolistic corporations need to invest time, money, and other expenses into android technology?  People in such a future, indeed, in our present, are available to be the proverbial cannon fodder, and so would not have to ""see what"" Rutger Hauer's character saw with his genetically engineered synthetic eyes.  In the novel, the future human and animal populations were decimated by postindustrial pollution, warfare, and enviromental irresponsibility (and remember, Phillip K. Dick was writing a generation ago!).  So lonely, depopulated humans invented talking doors, ovens, and so forth, and artificial animals for those who couldn't afford real ones.  Artificial humans a logical outcome of such a future.  Now the movie worked so well visually, and the story line was so consistent with the older established film-noire detective genre, that this big difference with the book isn't a fatal flaw in the movie, but I give you all this background to note a real hypocrisy in the artistic differences between the director and the studio that resulted in these different movie versions.  In an interview on NPR, the director, the very same director still miffed that the studio changed his ideas for the first run of the movie, laughs off the interviewers question about how irritated Phillip K. Dick was with Bladerunner veering so far from the original important fundmental premises and situations laid out in the novel.  Ridley Scott than candidly admits that he ""never actually read the book,"" because he didn't have the attention span for it!  The NPR interviewer responds by stating that she can understand why the author might not have liked the movie then.",1212364800,,2488,5.133663366336633

The 1080p resolution made it seem like I was watching it for the first time all over again! There were myriad little details that I had never seen before, graffiti on the walls and so forth, that makes me very glad to have upgraded my 27"" Standard Definition TV to a 50"" 1080p DLP TV.

I'll be honest, Blade Runner is my most favourite film (Followed by Once Upon A Time In The West). I loved the voice over version, couldn't figure the unicorn scene and now am able to enjoy 5 slightly different versions at my leisure. I was disappointed when rumours started in the late 90's/early 2000's that Sir Ridley Scott wanted to tell a more complete story in his own way(The man is a Movie making genius.), but the films owners etc could not agree on the project.

Now it's here and done and is what I call a modern day masterpeice. Whilst containing special effects, it's not ruined by them or overtaken by them like certain other Sci Fi films. The crisp film quality, awesome 5.1 sound, this film has matured into an awesome product. Ridley's final Cut version is indeed satisfying and I am glad they sorted out those loveable errors which we can still see in some of the versions but not in the final.

Thank God Joanna Cassidy agreed to come back and reshoot the Zora dying scene. Thank God the cables on the spinners have gone and that Batty death scene has become night and not daylight.

I just wish Harrison Ford would sort out any issues with Sir Ridley Scott and allow the film stand up proudly as a high quality work it is. It would have been really cool to have had the Core cast and Ridley sitting around a table discussing the merits and opinions of the film and their anidotes.

Whilst some might not be happy or think this edition offers nothing new, for me it does. It looks tidy, sounds tidy and lives up to what I saw way back in 1982. All the extras in the case are really quite cool. I guess a replica of his gun would've been a nice touch or a big poster that I could've had lamenated and on my wall but I am really happy with what I received.

I'd like to thank Sir Ridley Scott, the Film's entire cast, The film's 2007 restoration team & the various BR fan sites that never gave up hope for making this fan so very happy. And thank you to Phillip K. Dick for creating such an interesting story. Despite the film being slightly different from the book, it was a masterful inspiration.

You may not need all the other bells and whistles, not to mention that this doesn't fit on ANY DVD rack, but you should, at the very least, buy the boxed set that contains all of the films (too bad the ""work print"" can only be found here-- not as radical a take as reported, but another interesting look).",1211846400,,704,4.46875

You actually start to feel sorry for them on a number of occasions, further strengthening the argument of why Genetic cybord/android  clones with emotions is dangerous and wrong. I only hope they come out with sequels based on the books. If they were to do that then this movie could easily become one of the greatest movies of all time. it is kinda like star wars without the empire strikes back, and return of the jedi by itself its a good film but with other films building on its foundation it would be phenomenal.",1211846400,,849,4.736486486486487

First, I really liked the Final Cut. Warning: I'm giving something away here if you haven't seen it yet, so continue to the next paragraph if you don't want to know. Anyway, in particular, seeing Zhora running from Deckard without the obvious stunt woman wig was a great fix. That scene used to completely rip me out of my suspension of disbelief as my eyes rolled to the back of my head.

I know some people like the voice-over, and I know it's quite controversial. I would just say that voice-overs, used carefully, can work. Personally, I like the additional information provided by the narrative. However, in the original version, I think it was over-used. The movie Dune, for example, seemed to be told completely inside people's heads, which ruined the film for me.

Next, the behind-the-scenes documentary was fabulous. I had no idea what a challenge it was to put together one of my favorite films. For fans of the movie, this edition provides a ton of interesting information and stories. I was blown away. I'm amazed the movie ever made it to theaters.

Even with Mr. Scotts expression that this is HIS preferred final cut there are some redundancies in scenes that made me go 'huh?'.  As a fan of the various actors (i.e. Sanderson, recently appearing in Deadwood) it's cool to see the variations that have evolved.  One edition would probably be enough, but the choice of several iterations make it a viable repeat option.",1211587200,,554,4.75
109080,5,0790729628,"26 years after its original release, this visionary film gets another revision by its director, 'bad boy' Ridley Scott. I say bad boy, but in fact, he is the good boy who stood up to his beliefs at the time when the studios used their contractual powers to impose foolish creative control.

Personally, I didn't think the Final Cut was that different from the original Director's Cut; but yes indeed, it had a couple of new moments that, I guess, could justify the hype.

Also, I am personally not a very big fan of such ""complete collections""- yet another trick by the studios and their greedy sales teams, trying to 'extort' additional money from the customer. I was gladly going to buy just the Final Cut, separately- it's enough to me. Honestly who (except certain teenage kids with rich parents) has the time and the energy to see all available versions- including the unfortunate ""narrated"" version that Scott was forced to release first? Blade-Runner marathon? Overdose guaranteed!

Anyway. All in all, this is the best copy of Blade-Runner ever released for purchase by the rest of us mortals. Since it is on a High Def Blu-Ray disk, you can see much more beautiful crisp detail. Blu-Ray disks will change our experience of and attitude towards viewing movies at home. Once you go Blu-Ray, you never go... well you know the drill.",1211587200,,1338,4.783549783549783

  This is primarily a warning to those who have seen the original studio-cut version of Blade Runner (VHS, TV, or theatrical release):  you may be disappointed by these new two-disk Final Cut or the earlier Dierector's Cut versions of Blade Runner because the running Harrison Ford narration has been removed. Despite that, these are still very good films.

  I believe the original studio version of Blade Runner is one of the best science fiction movies ever produced.

  However, it appears that the Harrison Ford background narration of the original release is still missing from the DVD versions.  I believe this could have been easily included as an alternate audio feature selection.

  I have read that this extra narration was added over the artistic objections of original director and now all the new basic DVD versions are being made as he had first intended.

  In my opinion, the original studio version was a much superior film.  The background narration lets us better identify with the secretive main character of this film and understand his strange world to an extent not possible with the natural dialog and visuals of the story.

  Again, I do not dis-recommend these revised versions of the film.  But those familiar with the original version may be disappointed by the missing narration -- especially as they may not realize that reviews of expensive four and five-disk sets are also lumped into this same review-stream.  These reviews indicate inclusion of otherwise unobtainable, theatrical-release Blade Runner DVDs in those sets.

  When I first bought the similar Director's Cut version, I felt cheated.  That film seemed to be an incomplete pre-release version of the original film that I was expecting.  I bought this Final Cut version because I was misled by comments in this review stream which I had assumed to be limited to the two-disk Final Cut version.

  I think the narration does add entertainment value to the film, but it may also sugar-coat the director and author's intended warning of the consequences a polluted world of wall-to-wall people and run-away genetic engineering.

  I do agree that the extra green-field, escapist ending of the studio version is not required to make this film work.

  Some people have complained that the narration seems dead and unemotional.  I think the tone of that narration was exactly in character for a man called out of retirement to do one more dangerous and dirty job -- tracking down a group of murderous, short-lived biological androids.  If Harrison Ford had no heart for adding this extra narration, then this might be a good example of the principle of method acting.

Ridley Scott pulled a George Lucas and fiddled with the film. The ""Final Cut"" content-wise is NOT better than the ""Directors Cut."" It added nothing to the story.

I do appreciate that they cleaned the film up but I wish they had done it to the original 1984 Version. Most people who are fans of this film are fans because of that cut. Scott should realize that fans have been waiting for a good version of that 1984 cut and restored it as well. The film wouldn't be what it is today without that version. I missed having the narration by by Harrison Ford. I was so very happy that I could get that version on DVD instead of having to drag out the old VHS version.

I could have gotten a cheaper edition of this film to be sure but I like these specially boxed anniversary type collections. I haven't had time to watch the special features yet, so I can't review that part. All I can tell you is I like the fact that they're there.

If all you want is the 1984 version, I would recommend you find one of the 4-Disc sets or maybe a used set.

Hope this helps.

Update January 18, 2009: I have finally watched the special features. The ""making of"" disc is a pretty in-depth look at what went into making this film. Very enjoyable.

But here's my complaint... I spent 50 dollars, to get this, and I get two original versions (US and International), a Director's Cut, a Final Cut, and a SUPER DUPER RARE ULTRA AWESOME Workprint Release... and it's all the same.

The cuts have no differences in scenes.  The only major differences are sorted into two camps: crappy happy ending and Ford's voiceover narration (US and International), and noirish ending without voiceover narration (everything else).

The other differences are so miniscule you'd barely notice.  Aside from digital enhancing and such, they've done little more than tweak and move things around, change some things here, fix other things, ""restore"" things that you would barely even notice if they didn't boldly proclaim it, fix some dialogue that leaves the fate of the fifth and sixth replicants unknown, as well spending who knows how much money on SUPER DUPER AWESOME TECHNOLOGY just to get Harrison Ford's son to come in, mouth some dialogue, and digitally place his mouth over Deckard's during the scene where he questions the snake dealer, because apparently his mouth didn't originally sync up with the dialogue.

As great a movie as this is, and whichever version you prefer (sadly for me, I hate the happy ending, love the Director's Cut ending, and yet I hate the lack of narration, preferring the feel it gives to the film), it's simply not a very good deal to spend 50 dollars for a fifth version of the same thing you get in four other versions of the movie.",1209686400,2,1701,4.841379310344828

Well actually waiting, waiting for the right time to watch it. Then one day I find out that this film is coming to Blu Ray and after release, I order off Amazon and a week later sit down in front of my 42inch Full HD 1080P LCD TV to watch the awesome Blade Runner!!

With years of people nagging at me to watch this great film, I sit ready to be blown away for what I presume will be the most epic film ever!

Then the film starts, EPIC EPIC EPIC is all I see, reminding myself how old this film is, every scene is garnished in fine quality and art. My jaw still on the floor, realising that this film was made years ago yet feels that is was done last year.

When the film was over, I felt something that I really did not want to feel, I was disappointed. Do not get me wrong, this film is a beautiful and will be in my honoured collection of films but it would fall under my arty category. The best way I can describe this to you would be that for such an epic feel, the story was claustrophobic. I am sure the idea was ahead of its time but let's just say. My expectation was put so high that I expected something else.

My best advice for the readers is, if you're into artistic, futuristic worlds then this film is defiantly for you! 4 out 5!

I gave it 3 out of 5, for personal feeling of the film. I just wish maybe I could have experienced this film when it was first released, in a time where films liken this would have blown my mind.

109118,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner was a five star movie that had an exceptionally good plot.  It also featured astounding special effects which were amazing to see on the big screen.  Much of this work was done with large scale models and fog machines that really helped to establish the atmosphere and feel of the film visually. Several of the screen and sound effects were taken from Ridley Scott's Alien, including computer graphic screens and miscellaneous electronic sound effects.  In addition, the sets, models, and costumes were wonderfully organic, as were the original sets of Giger's from Alien.

The story concerns humaniod robots in the first quarter of the 21st century that have intelligence and agility at least as great as that of the genetic engineers who designed them.  The robots are called Replicants because they are physically equivalent to human beings down to their organs, blood and bone structure. The strength and speed of these androids is much greater than that of a human, and they can be a great deal of trouble to deal with.

The story takes for granted that such advanced robots possess true consciousness and are quite willing to fight and even kill human beings in order to continue their existance which has been intentionally limited to a life span of four years.  This is one of the few robot films to come out of Hollywood which does not depend on Asimov's three laws of robotics for the story.

One new science fiction twist on robotics used in this film is the implanting of false memories of childhood, parents and a long prior existance. Though false, these implanted memories mean a great deal to the androids at the ""emotional"" level who carry photos of their false history, parents and childhood homes even when they are aware that these memories are false. This was a totally new concept to me as a long time fan of robots in science fiction film and gave me a new perspective on the value of memories.

The film stars Harrison Ford who plays a special law officer or Blade Runner. As a Blade Runner he is authorized to use deadly force in the pursuit of ""Replicants"" to terminate (or retire) them on the planet Earth where their use has been banned.  The story becomes even more interesting when the Blade Runner falls in love with a beautiful female Replicant who is used to calibrate the andoroid detection software used by Blade Runner detectives.

One scene which was particularly effective involved Harrison Ford revealing to the female android that she is artificial, something she has been unaware of since activation because of her false memory implants.  This is the scene in which Harrison Ford falls in love with this very beautiful ""woman"" because of her well portraid vulnerability, emotions and sadness at learning that she is artificial.  She is deeply hurt and shattered by the new knowledge and the tough Blade Runner instantly falls in love when she breaks down and silently cries after hearing his revelation and convincing evidence.",1209340800,,2981,4.867588932806324

Unfortunately, most of the movie takes place in dark rooms, intended to symbolize, perhaps, a dark future but serves only to underscore the unreality of the film.  Any real person going into any of the rooms in this film would open the drapes or turn on a light.  It is like the technical director is about 14 years old.

And it is slow, possibly so that we don't miss the product placement.

I know this is supposed to be noirish, but noir films always clip right along.  This drones along with a David Lynch obscurity (again, think 14 year old).

It is incredible what they were able to do with models (some two dimensional) and lighting.  There is a great deal here on how to make a movie.  The professionals' comments helped me appreciate just how many great innovations it took to take me into that future world.  Also, the resource disc is a valuable treat for Sci-Fi fans.  There is quite a bit on Philip K. Dick including interviews with him, his family, and other SF writers.  Brian Aldiss is one of the interviewees.  Dick's interviews are very interesting with him pulling no punches to save Hollywood's feelings.

The face that it comes in a Voight Kampf case is really an added bonus.  The little chachkis they put in like the unicorn and the spinner are also neat and show off your love and geeky-ness to your office mates nicely.  But what I love the most about the collection (and what George could learn from) is the inclusion of absolutely every version of the movie in existence in addition to the restoration of the film.

Ridley Scott clearly knows his audience and fans and even though some of the fans' favorites were his own, he still catered their tastes and their likes and put out all the editions with the same care as he released his final, updated version.  So if you saw the original with narration and love it, it's here for you in beautiful, crisp imagery.  Want to see the European version that you've never seen?  Here as well.

The most impressive is possibly Scott's final cut.  Beautifully cleaned up, true to the story, even reshot with one of the original actresses (remember the ""falling through the glass scene"" so clearly a double?) to make the movie seamless.

Disk One is the new director's edition.  This disk contains three comentary tracks. The director  is on one; several screenwriters are on track two; they discuss how the screenplay went from the book through several good and bad rewrites; the final commentary is by several of the special effects workers.  I sampled a little of each, and it was quite interesting.  Disk Two is a documentary on making the Blade Runner. Disk Three contains the three previous versions:the original American and international cuts, and the one previous directors cut. Each of these has the same great picture quality as the new cut.  However, my version(U.S.) had no alternate language (english only and no commentary) on these archive cuts although the new cut does.  Final disk has several short features that seem to concentrate on Philip Dick's writings.  I sampled a couple, and they seemed really interesting.

I am not a Blade Runner fanatic, but I always enjoyed the movie since seeing it at the college union several years after the original movie release.  I thought this new cut does provide the best version. I sampled part of the original version and liked this one much better without the narration by H.Ford. I really enjoyed this collection.

109141,5,0790729628,"The Good Things
*Very good special effects, even to this day.
*Very strong, vivid imagery.  Excellent cameramanship.  Great, smooth, slick style (reminiscent of the film-noir genre).
*Excellent production value.  The sets are well-detailed.  The lighting is totally bizzare (in a good way).  The costumes are good and imaginative.  Much of it is interesting and artistic.
*Storyline is pretty straightforward, and leaves plenty of room for characters and themes.
*Characters are pretty neat.  I don't think they're extremely deep, but they are distinctive.  Much of the time, they leave you wondering who are the androids and who are the humans.
*Funky, imaginative music score.

The Bad Things
*Even though the basic story and characters are the same, there are many huge differences between this and the original book (""Do Anroids Dream of Electric Sheep"" by Phillip K Dick; an awesome book!).  Could also be a good thing, because the filmmakers made it their own thing and came up with something original.
*It is a slower movie, based more on style and mood than on action.

Film-noir joins forces with futuristic sci-fi to bring us a bleak but fantastic vision of the future.  With such great settings, strong imagery, and smashing special effects, it is easy to see why this film is such a classic.  It is very deep and artistic, and each new viewing presents something new to see or think about.  Some may consider it boring, but everybody should see it at least once.

The two-disc special edition includes the final cut of the movie (which has no voice-over narrative, no happy ending, and many subtle changes), and the ""Dangerous Days"" documentary.  The four-disc version has these same two discs plus three other versions of the movie (the original theatrical cut, the international cut (with more violence), and the 1994 director's cut (which is much like the final cut)).  Disc four also has a number of additional featurettes and galleries.

The only small complaint is that they left off the scenes that made you wonder if our favourite anti-hero was himself a replicant (leaving this out made all those scenes showing the red glass like eyes of the artifical lifeforms a bit pointless).

In one segment, they showed the Millennium Falcon building they put in the cityscape, but no one mentioned it verbally, which seemed odd.

No, I didn't go crazy and buy the super deluxe, suitcase, with the wings from the dove bonus collectible, etc... sure one or two of the extras on that version sound cool but for me this is just the right amount of material.

What can I say, the film looks and sounds amazing - I was fortunate to have seen it re-released at The Ziegfeld in NYC but being able to watch it again and again is wonderful. I must say I was a bit disappointed with Ridley's commentary as he rambles quite a bit and does not seem to be watching the movie after a while as his comments often do not relate to what is on screen. He just doesn't seem that focused or enthusiastic about the process.

However the 'making of' segments are phenomenal - a filmmaker or film lovers dream! Tons of development information, behind the scenes decisions, fights, etc. Very educational, informative and engaging and worth the price just for these segments alone.",1207872000,,1032,4.5133689839572195

109157,5,0790729628,"I've just watched the new edition of Blade Runner and feel like saying a few words on the film. Why review a 25 year old film? For the same reason it's been reissued. It's a pretty important film.

What I have to say fits under three headings.

1. Plot
You know the story. Dangerous criminals are on the streets of LA and only one man can stop them. Several chase scenes and a few fights later, he does, rescuing a beautiful girl in the process. It's a basic thriller plot, used in hundreds of films for a very good reason. It works. It's got very little to do with the Philip K Dick book the script is ostensibly based on. The only thing worth saying about this aspect of the film is that it's very well done and makes for great entertainment. Think 'Total Recall'. Remember it's the plot I'm talking about here. Score 8/10.

2. The Setting
Everything to do with the look of the film: sets, costumes, artifacts, design, lighting and camera are incredibly well done and make this film one of the most influential ever made. Not necessarily original, but influential nevertheless. Here we get a taste of the world Dick made, where technology has developed fangs and claws and makes life difficult for the people it's supposed to help. It's a believable future and we're half fascinated, half repelled by its depiction. The detail is astonishing and the production interacts very effectively. This is why we remember the film. It's Armageddon with a cobra stare we can't turn away from.  Score 10/10.

3. The Themes
The film is loosely based on the Philip K Dick book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'. Dick is a major novelist with a lot of very important things to tell us if only we could forget he was a science fiction writer and listen. Dick's world is consistently one in which machines have demonstrated they have no humanity even should they be simulacra. The book is full of astonishing concepts that the film has ditched to make room for the chase scenes and perhaps that's unavoidable. But considerable play is made in the film on the nature of the android/replicant characters. Much ink has been spilt determining who is or is not an android/replicant among the major characters. Ridley Scott has emphasised Deckard's replicant nature when he remade the film (Director's Cut). But the physical nature of these characters is relatively unimportant. Dick's theme, carried over to the film, is: what is human? In a world where a replicant can only be discovered by means of an intricate psychological test, and real humans are behaving more and more like machines, the meaning and value of 'human' becomes important to define. Humans are not automatically humane, just as replicants are not automatically automata. The film emphasises this by showing the  only characters who act with humanity to be replicants. It's not profound but it's moving. Score 9/10 (loses a point for leaving out so much of the book).

The Edition
The choice is a 5 disc, 4 disc, Final Cut or Director's cut edition. If you're a fan you've already got the 5 disc edition. If you're studying film you'll buy the 5 disc edition for the workprint and the rare chance to see how the film was shaped and adapted through the production process. In my view the Final Cut, though beautiful to look at, was not worth the effort. My choice was the 4 disc edition, which contains all the fabulous extras and my preferred edition, the original theatrical release, which stays a tad closer to Dick's vision than the Director's Cut. And it's the best value for money as well.

There's so much more to say but I'll just go and watch the film again.",1207440000,2,3621,4.673469387755102
109158,5,0790729628,"What can I say about this Blu-ray 5-disk collector's set? Well, maybe I'm just biased towards this film, but I have to say this is really one of the best, if not the best Collector's sets out there.

Everything that kept this film from being as perfect as can be has now been corrected in the ""Final Cut"" version of the film. Ridley Scott did not take a page from George Lucas and butchered this amazing film. He just corrected the flaws in this film that he couldn't fix at the time, because of budget and time restrictions.

Though, do not worry, all corrections are seamless. This is what truly makes these corrections really great, is that unless you have already seen the previous versions, you wouldn't even know what was corrected. This is the sole reason why I'm not even going to mention what corrections were made, just so for those who have never seen this movie can see for themselves if they can spot them. I'm confident to say I doubt they will be able to.

 What you will notice right away is how amazing the PQ/SQ is of this film (Final Cut). This movie looks like it could have been shot yesterday, and I'm not exaggerating. I own the Blu-ray set, so I can't speak for the SD-DVD set, but I'm sure it's amazing in it's own right as well.

Though, if you want the best experience and you own an HDTV, then I recommend you get yourself a Blu-ray player and buy the Blu-ray 5-Disk Collector's Edition Set. It's expensive, but worth every dollar.

So, what do you get in this 5-disk collector's set?

5 versions/cuts of the film, which includes the rare workprint version.

3 hour+ documentary that will pretty much give you all the information you want and more about the making of the film.

Deleted Scenes, Casting Auditions, etc....

SD-DVD, or Blu-ray you will not be dissapointed.",1207440000,2,1799,4.5246913580246915
109159,5,0790729628,"I loved the DVD version -- not sure how much better a dark and foggy film like this would be in HD.
The Spinner toy is cool, but a little shoddy in fit and finish --- I looked for the Ford logo.

The picture quality is very good.

The features were awesome -- especially the head replacement fix on the kick-murder replicant.

The full-body photo of Cassidy with snake made me cry for hours!!!  Good gawd what a beautiful Woman:
too bad I wouldn't live long ... but then again, who does ? And she's even gorgeouser in the head-fix feature , after all these years.

Now, with apologies to the more intellectual types, I happen to like the voice-over original best. Far from
being insulting to my intelligence, I get a ""flavor"" of the old detective movies from the voice-over.

ONE THING --- I saw the original in a theater in Tampa, FL and I could swear that Harrison Ford ordered and got FISH EYE SOUP at the diner and actually slurped up one of them with chopsticks ( he wanted 4 eyes but the lady insisted on two ).

When I saw fish on his plate, I was surprised. I remember this because it anticipated the later scene where the genetic engineer / eye specialist  is  garnished with frozen eyeballs before he is killed.

It bothers me no end that even this ""ULTIMATE"" collection doesn't have the one I saw first.

I still loved the movie, but I was let down.

Finally the original theatrical release, with the cheesy detective narration is released, and the image quality is amazing!

Not only do you get the original theatrical version, but you get the directors cut, work-print version (with scenes not seen in the ther versions) and ""Final Cut"" version which looks and sounds amazing. All of this comes in a briefcase that resembles a voight-kampf case. It also comes with some interesting concept art prints, a model police spinner and a small unicorn origami statue.

This is an amazing value even at 3 times the price. This is the edition of the movie that was released for those of us the love Blade Runner. this movie was 23 years in the making and they finally got it right!",1206921600,,1061,4.632978723404255
109179,5,0790729628,"After buying three different 'definitive' versions of ""Blade Runner"", I was gun-shy about purchasing yet another...but this is an excellent investment, as you'll never find a more comprehensive look at the creation of a groundbreaking SF classic, with insights from virtually all of the major creative people involved.

Be warned; if you aren't already a ""Blade Runner"" fan, this new collection will probably not change your opinion of the film. The ""Blade Runner"" vision of the future is not happy, or upbeat, but of a dying world choking in it's own overpopulation and pollution, where a multitude of cultures compete for space, and life is grim, at best. The sheer power of the visual elements, alone (done, amazingly, without CGI) would forever change how filmmakers would visualize cities...but Scott's relentlessly grim vision, and the noir drama of tenacious lawman Harrison Ford hunting down four androids desperately trying to survive, is not one that appeals to everyone!

Wisely, this collection offers four versions of the film; the voice-over narration 'happy ending' 1982 theatrical release, the longer, more graphic 1982 'international' release, Ridley Scott's initial 'Director's Cut' (eliminating the 'voice-overs', and adding the famous 'unicorn' sequence), and a new, 'final' edition, cleaning up and tweaking several scenes that time and money constraints prevented, at the time of release. Each version has it's own admirers, and even Scott himself acknowledges all have merit.

The real 'bonus' of this collection is, certainly, the feature-length documentary, ""DANGEROUS DAYS: MAKING BLADE RUNNER"", one of the most comprehensive histories of a film, from inception to re-birth as a cult masterpiece, that I've ever seen. Pulling no punches, the cast and crew candidly discuss the troubled production, on-and-off-set misadventures, and the constant war between vision and budget.

Finally, the fourth disc offers a wide variety of features delving deeper into the creative forces that produced what would ultimately become ""Blade Runner"", and how an 'art house' science fiction film was marketed at a time of more upbeat, audience-friendly productions.

109194,3,0790729628,"After the fanfare surrounding the 2007 Director's Cut release of Blade Runner, I said to myself, ""How could I have never seen this film?"" So I put it in my Netflix queue on Blu Ray at the end of last year and was informed of ""a very long wait."" So I added it to my Amazon wish list after seeing some of my Friends here praise the movie as classic.

But I never ultimately purchased the movie. There was just something...something not compelling. I changed my Netflix request from the Blu Ray version to the standard DVD version and still got the long wait message. So I left it that way and forgot about it. Lo and behold, Blade Runner arrived after almost a 90 day wait from the time I requested it.

Why that long-winded story above? Because it should speak volumes about how great this film is, right? Well, not really. What Blade Runner is...is a 'cult' classic. Which means there are a ton of fanatics that will want to crucify me for this review that suggests Blade Runner is a good movie...not a classic movie.

Sure I saw the 'visionary' aspect of the film. I saw the effects that were way ahead of their time. I saw the great package that was offered for this release...one that included 5-disks worth of material! But, color me shallow, I'm in it for the movie and its quality. Even the movies that I collect as classics 'in my book' are in my collection not because of hours of extras (in fact I rarely watch extras...maybe a making-of here or there *if* it promises to be short). I usually only *buy* a movie for my collection that blew me away. Getting blown away by a movie is the definition of a classic to me; a movie that had great 'vision' for its time to me is a movie that had great vision for its time...not a classic.

Blade Runner was a good movie. One that had an interesting visionary approach. The story was very cool. ""Replicant"", genetically engineered humans are man-made to perform menial tasks on ""off-worlds"" that ultimately revolt in an I, Robot kind of way. But Blade Runner had an odd pace, the action was reined in over dark, futuristic images, and the film seemed just discombobulated at times.

So I'll stop whining like a 4 year old now, and wrap this up by saying--again--Blade Runner was a *good* movie. But, man, you'd have to be a real die-hard to buy some 5-disk edition and watch not one, but three versions of this movie with hours and hours of extras.

Unlike some directors who say something like, ""if you want it on DVD or Blu-ray you will watch the version I want you to watch"" or who release the different versions one at a time costing a fortune, Ridley Scott put all the releases in one fantastic package. He even said that he knows some people have a passion for one release over others and he wanted to honor that and release all of them in the best possible format. Now there is a director that cares about his fans!

If you have never seen Blade Runner, you are in for a treat. If you are a fan of Blade Runner, you must buy this set! Don't just buy the new version, spend the extra money and get the whole thing.

I've owned practically every version that was released, including the first VHS, two different laser disc versions including the Criterion ""International"" cut, and the original DVD ""Director's"" cut.  But, the HD DVD release, including the Ridley Scott ""Final Cut"", is genuinely the ULTIMATE.  The new Final Cut has footage never before seen, omits the hackneyed narration, and in HD with Dolby True HD sound, is like viewing the film anew.  The HD image is so sharp one can discern every individual light in the Tyrell complex' huge building, and every wrinkle in J. F. Sebastion's face.  The sound, with that beautiful Vangelis music, is simply overwhelming.  Buy it!  And, even if you don't yet have an HD player, I recommend you buy that version.  Having ALL the various versions together on such a great media is worth every penny of the purchase price.  And, the price: best I've seen at on-line and brick-and-mortar merchants!  Oh, and the brief case with the other goodies?  Just frosting on a rich cake!

109224,5,0790729628,"If you're a Blade Runner fan, any review of this product will simply be superfluous. For everyone else, I hope the following is a useful review of this particular box set.
Suffice it to say, the package pretty much satiates any need you may have in connection with this haunting, gorgeous film. Be warned, though: even the most ardent lover of Blade Runner is likely to walk away sick and tired of the damned thing if it is watched in one session.
It is breathtaking in its scope: The 1982 Domestic Cut, the 1982 International Cut, the 1991 ""Director's Cut"" (falsely advertised as such, but closer to our man Ridley's intentions), the 2007 Final Cut - a true director's cut - and the Workprint, previewed in Dallas and Denver three months prior to the film's general release.
The 'making of' documentary runs to a staggering 3 1/2 hours, and talks to every surviving person you would want to hear from. Everyone. And that's not the only documentary. There are profiles of the late Phillip K Dick, the late, lamented cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth, and features on costumes, graphic design and the making of the Final Cut. And there are trailers, audio interviews with Dick, and other assorted segments.
There is also a 45-minute sequence of deleted scenes and alternate takes, tastefully edited into a linear narrative, featuring unused voice-over material from Harrison Ford. It doesn't quite work as an alternate version of the film (if you saw it without knowledge of the real film, you'd likely be lost), but it is a fascinating document.
The briefcase is plastic, and contains a plastic faux-origami unicorn and a miniature spinner, plus other little bits and bobs. This briefcase release is the only one to feature the workprint and the documentary on the Final Cut.

I'm not going to go into the plot.  That has been hashed and rehashed here over and over many times.

Warner Brothers finally gives Scott's Sci-fi masterpiece the treatment it deserves.  5 different versions of the film, commentaries, interviews, documentaries, etc.  Any and all of your questions are answered in the extensive bonus material.

The final cut is a sight to behold.  If you have a widescreen TV and a good sound system, you're in for a real treat.  Watch it at night with all the lights off and the sound crancked.  You'll feel like Roy Batty is about to step out of the screen and smack you around.

109267,4,0790729628,"Blade Runner is a five star movie.  So why have I given this box-set only 4 stars?  I won't go on about the merits of Ridley Scott's landmark movie as it's a classic, pure and simple.  Instead this review is based purely on the Blu-Ray presentation.

Now I had this set (the tin box version) on Standard DVD at Christmas and fell in love with it.  Everything about it was breathtaking.  From the box design right through to the actual content on the 5 discs.

However when we come to this Blu-Ray release there are problems.
Firstly the Final Cut has a fair amount of noise throughout the film.  The most apparent artifacting is seen early on during the scene when Deckard is interviewing Rachel: Tyrell's head completely breaks up into tiny white pixels!!!!!!!  Considering Warner's spent a fortune on a 4K digital clean up this is unacceptable.

Next Disc 3 (the other 3 versions Blade Runner) - Apart from the brilliant and seamless branching, this has even more noise, especially on the FX shots which now look horrid.

Disc 5: The Workprint - by far the worst picture quality you will ever see on a Blu-Ray release.  Imagine a filthy battered old VHS tape dragged though a desert dipped in oil and then transferred to a HD disc, that will give you some idea as to what you'll be looking at.  You've been warned.

Finally Disc's 2 & 4.  The only problem I have with these special features is that they are presented in Standard DVD.  This is a big issue I have.  If a studio isn't prepared to upscale special features to HD then forget it, I'd rather stick with the normal DVD release, it's far cheaper too.  Sure the content on these two discs are amazing, superb deleted scenes, featurette's and the best documentary you will ever see.

So a disappointing release on the new format.

My advice is to stick with the Standard DVD set as this is a real mixed bag and any problem with the prints are only highlighted on HD.",1204329600,,1925,4.492795389048991
109268,1,0790729628,"I had to return this set and order a different type. when I got it, I found that it was Blu-ray and I don't have that. I get frustrated with all the different types of the same DVD!",1204243200,5,181,3.789473684210526
109269,4,0790729628,"Blade Runner is my second favorite movie, and there's always been a certain amount of dissatisfaction among Blade Runner fans regarding details that should or should not have found their way into the original release of the film.  Owners of this 5-disk collector's edition have no reason to complain, as EVERY VERSION OF THE FILM THAT HAS EVER EXISTED (barring any that were edited for television) is included here in the packege.  Personally, I debated whether or not to shell out the dough for this edition for a little while, and I think that the deal-maker for me was the inclusion of the work-print in this release.  I'm satisfied, more satisfied than I feel I would've been with just the 2-disc edition, but I also feel like I'd have been just as happy buying one fewer disc, and a lot fewer plastic doo-dads.

Disc one is Ridley Scott's Final Cut, currently the definative version of this film and hopefully the last ""improved"" version that will ever be released.  The content is just about the same as that of the 1992 director's cut, with a scene here and there from the workprint spliced in, and some special effects wizardry to correct gripes such as a stunt-double's wig not looking proper, or Harrison Ford's lips not matching the audio track.  There are three commentaries, and although I've only listened to two of them so far, I'd say that they're worthwhile (although it's tough to tell if Hampton Fancher and David Peoples were really just about fed up with each other during the recording of their commentary, or were just putting on a show for the microphone.)

Disc two is a making-of documentry.  If you've ever read Paul M. Sammon's ""Future Noir:  The Making of Blade Runner,"" know that this disc contains most of the information that was included in that book, plus a whole lot more.  Most of the original cast is interviewed here (Ford included, although Will Sanderson is strangely absent, and a disclaimer at the end of the credits claims that absent cast members politely declined to be interviewed...,) both screenwriters give their input, and even PKD gets a little screen time with recordings made around the time of the filming.  In my mind, discs one and two absolutely make this edition.  (It should also be noted that discs one and two ARE the two-disc edition.)

Disc three is just an ""archive"" of the previous three versions of the film; the theatrical release, the home video cut, and the 1992 director's cut.  To me, there is so little difference between these three versions that this disc was probably just a waste of my money.  It's expendable

Disc four contains more featurettes, and it's as appriciated as disc two was.  There's some repetition of information, but they go a lot more in-depth with the specific aspects of the filming - wardrobe, effects, and so on.  If you're an info junkie like me, you'll like discs two and four equally.

Disc five is the workprint. I wanted a copy, and now I've got a copy, but it's not so much different from the film that a casual fan needs to see it.  Its lukewarm.

The rest of the space inside of the plastic briefcase that these DVDs come in is taken up with packing foam, artwork, and toys, for lack of a better word.  We're graced with a plastic model spinner, a plastic origami unicorn (which isn't even that good of a ringer for the one that Gaff leaves in the film, if you compare the two), and a plastic block with an animated second or two of footage from the movie - one of those graphics that appears to move if you rock it back and forth.  As an adult, I really didn't feel that I needed to pay for any of this, and all it did was jack up the purchase price unneccesarily.  I wish that I could sell them all back to Warner Home Video, but I can't.

The briefcase itself, also plastic, is really just as much a toy, and a cumbersome one to store.  The only reason they needed this large of a packege in the first place was to include all of the playthings, and as I've already said, I could have done without those.

The five discs are stored in a folding cardboard-and-plastic slipcase, decorated with conceptual artwork and photos or scenes from the production.  I wish that they had kept it one disc to a divider side, rather than overlapping the discs one on top of another, two to a side.  I'm always worried that I'll scratch a disc when I have to pry it off from on top of another just to get it out of the liner.

So, all in all, I'm satisfied, but they could have cut out one of five discs and all of the extra toys, and made me just as happy.",1204156800,2,4550,4.493317132442284
109270,4,0790729628,"I will not write the synopsis of the movie ""Blade Runner"" as this 5 disk Blu Ray pack contains all 4 official versions of this cult Future Noir (film noir in SF setting).

109273,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner: The Final Cut is an absolute must for fans who know all to well that this cult classic gem has gone through more cuts than a unmentioned well known pop star has had plastic surgery. One might prematurely cringe, having invested in the Director's Cut, thinking that its possible that the studios are trying to milk us for more money. This is far from the case. Blade Runner looks and sounds like a state of the art film. The entire print was digitized and special effects footage was scanned in at 8000 lines per frame. The new sound production quality is quite simply an Oscar worthy effort and the images are as clean as a whistle and sharpened to a razor.

The story revolves around Blade Runners, which means they are licensed to kill androids, who are given assignments to retire these illegal skin-jobs if they try to escape captivity from off-world colonies and integrate themselves in with society. Four replicants are on the loose and Blade Runner Deckard must hunt them down through a dystopian city.

Ridley Scott's art direction is probably the best the big screen has ever seen which is startling considering that the film is over 25 years old. The film achieved cult status on video after being panned by the critics (many of whom have reversed their position since). The SF author Philip K. Dick died before he could see his book come to life and since then other directors such as Steven Spielberg have filmed his material.

So what's new in Blade Runner: The Final Cut?
(1) The first meeting between Gaff and Deckard is shorter.
(2) Bryant mentions four skin jobs and not five.
(3) Some extra crowd shots.
(4) The unicorn dream sequence is extended.
(5) The snake seller scene has been correctly synced.
(6) Deckard meets a policeman before the Snake Pit.
(7) Two exotic dancers.
(8) Zhora's display case crash has been completely redone.
(9) Swear words have been removed from the Tyrell Batty meeting.
(10) The Tyrell murder sequence is uncut. You see the gouge.
(11) Pris's death sequence is extended.
(12) The dove at the end is released into the night sky, not daylight sky.

Blade Runner usually makes the top 20 films of all time. Once you have tasted the running you will be back for more. Every collection should have this movie and the final cut is no exception.

This is the way Blade Runner is meant to be seen. It is a movie about eyes and is all about seeing. Cherish the vision.",1203897600,2,2423,4.625581395348838
109274,5,0790729628,"Finally, I have the complete Bladerunner collection. The first movie I bought was the final cut on dvd a couple of years ago. Since then I allways wanted to have the original movie version on dvd, but in Belgium it was only available on vhs. Then came the announcement of the final cut and ever since I wanted to have it on Blueray Disc. After calling with several stores I knew that the 5-disc BR version would only be released via the US. Luckily for me it is zonefree so I immediately ordered it via Amazon. The good thing about this is that I payed as much for the 5-disc collection as I would pay if I bought the final cut here in Belgium. (the final cut version on blueray costs as much due to the dollar vs euro)

So after a couple of weeks I finally received the 5-disc collection and I must say it is great and exceeds what I expected. Especially the 2 bonus discs are great. (1 of the discs is over 3 hours of making of!)

It was great finally seeing the original movie version with the voiceover. (there are 2 movie versions on it, US and International ones) Then theres the final cut version which looks great on blueray. As another extra you get the workprint version which I haven't looked at.

So this is the disc setup:
disc1: final cut
disc2: movie versions (2) + director's cut
disc3: making of
disc4: another disc of extra's
disc5: workprint

Overall a great box and well worth the money. I would recommend this Blueray box to any Bladerunner fan.

Maybe one remark though: No subtitling with the 2 bonus discs, so I needed to turn up the volume for the 2 bonus discs to be able to hear everything on the bonus discs. (English isn't my primary language)",1203897600,3,1672,4.346153846153846

 Now am I baised, well yes, I love Harrision Ford and Sean Young, but Rugter Howard takes the cake in this movie. He brings a cool calm collected crepiness.

Briefcase contents: scale vehicle, plastic unicorn and plastic thingy with moving frame are all useless. My scale vehicle doesn't even run smoothly as one tire seems to be stuck. The unicorn is a nice souvenir but the plastic paint was not even well applied. I would have prefered some instructions on how to make a paper origami unicorn myself (if it is possible at all). The moving frame is such a cheap souvenir from a technique that has been around for decades, I wish they could have had brighter ideas for souvenirs. The pictures on the folder are ok, I am not sure I will look at them often. I guess these are just toys for a little kid but even he will not understand the movie so they might have no meaning for him.

The only thing I am worried about is that HD might be losing the battle. I play my discs on my Toshiba X205 Notebook and I have no problem, in fact the quality is like nothing else I've seen, but the Blue Ray vs HD battle seems to be dissapointing for consumers.

109294,5,0790729628,"It's sort of a shame that the reviews for the five disk BluRay release of Blade Runner are mixed in with the reviews of previous releases.  The Final Cut is breathtaking in both audio and video quality.  All of the well known 20th century video ""glitches"" have been cleaned up with 21st centuty technology. But, if you still like the previous Director's Cut, or the original theatrical version, you have all that too.  And the price can't be beat.
Sure, the story line of the movie could have been a little cleaner and tighter - even some of the people closely involved in the making of the movie admit that, but, while the movie is running, it's hard to take your eyes away from the screen. Just think, not even the people who saw the original theatrical screening of this movie were treated to such clarity - such visual and audio depth.
My recommendation - make some popcorn, fire up the big scren, dim the lights, and curl up with someone you love.  Movie watching doesn't get much better than this.",1203552000,3,1003,4.524861878453039

I have only seen the Final Cut (newest) version on the Blu-Ray, but plan to eventually watch all the other version. Picture quality and sound quality is excellent. I have also watched the 3+ hour ""Making of"" and it was really wonderful!

109324,5,0790729628,"I saw Blade Runner when it was released in Beirut in 1983. I remember going to Hamra street, an avenue filled with movie theaters, and I just saw the poster of the film, and I decided to check it out. The civil war in Beirut was raging at the time, and one of the only distraction we could have was going to cinemas, plus movie theaters were like  bomb shelters.

And two hours passed as if I was suspended in time, gone into a new zone, where nothing outside mattered anymmore.
I got this strange feeling: I belonged to the film, I became part of the set, I felt like hovering above the city with Olmos; it felt possible and accessible; one day we'll have that. Then there was Sean Young. Few years earlier, I fell in love with Carrie Fisher, I had Star Wars poster on my wall; but Young, my God, who's this woman?
I was so overwhelmed during teh film. Went and saw it over and over; my friends couldn't understand where's the fuss; they were into realism because the civil war and what not, they were into social messages and big themes etc...Blade Runner IS realism. It will look like that. Whatever...
After emigrating to Los Angeles, I went downtown looking for the Biltmore; at the time it was still rundown, ravaged by time; but at least, I got to see where it all happened. I thought maybe it did.

The documentaries and wonderfully insightful and even Harrison comes out to say a few things, which is something most fans probably didn't expect. Amazingly, every cut of the film is included and the clarity of each disc is phenomenal.
The box is very well designed even having hinges as opposed to the usual bent plastic spine and mimics the briefcase holding Deckards famous Voight Kampff machine. The extra ""toys"" it comes with are cool especially the Spinner which again, could've been another cheap thing but this is actually quite a good little model replete with opening doors.
And also, I must say that the price of this item is extraordinary considering the value of the discs alone. I would've paid much more for something this special.",1203033600,,909,4.947712418300654
109327,3,0790729628,"As a fan of the original 1982 movie, I was excited to see the different versions of this film coalesce into a single high-def collection. The extras of the so called Ultimate Collector's Edition were just too tempting to pass up.

Looking at the images on this and other sites, and considering the price of this collection at retail brick-and-mortar stores, I figured I was getting a deal. The truth is, however, that the quality of the packaging and included items are sub-par and thus do not justify the price premium over the Complete Collector's Edition. The briefcase, origami unicorn, and replica Spinner car are all made of cheap plastic and lack heft, feeling as though they would break if they sustained even a short fall. That's not to say that the packaging within the case isn't nice, I just expected more.

As far as the movie itself, you can't, and shouldn't, expect miracles just because it's been pressed to shiny Blu-ray. Still, for something filmed in the early '80s, it looks pretty good. Ridley Scott knows what he's doing, even if he is the most monotone person on the planet.

The final verdict: unless you're a completist, don't bother with the Ultimate Collector's Edition. The Complete Collector's Edition with just the five (5) discs should round out any collector's library nicely.",1203033600,,1308,4.882882882882883

I would say that this is ""The Definitive Limited Edition DVD Collectible Box Set"" to the 1982 Ridley Scott film; Blade Runner.  I must say it is a contender to some of the more 'pricey' box sets out there, if You have the opportunity to buy this one, BUY IT NOW before it's too late, otherwise You could end up spending up to $300.00 or more from online shops or private sellers in the near future!

What You see is what You get from the photos here on Amazon, and it's even better in person.
The coolest item for Me was the SPINNER car, made of plastic with working doors, however, not recommended for kids. The next cool item is the motion card of Harrison Ford/Deckard, set in a thick protective plastic baseball/football card type holder. Then there is the Unicorn, made of  chrome painted plastic, which very fragile! Also there is the Art Portfolio with pre-production art on one side with production stills on the back.

The only down side to this release is that Warner Home Video could have made room(""Marketing Strategy"")  in this collector's case for the 3 CD Vangelis soundtrack, but hey, beggars can't be choosy here.

The upside is that Warner Brothers actually released this DVD in 4 versions; 2-disc, 4-disc, 5-disc(Reviewed here) and the 5-disc in Europe (without the case of goodies) which converting the Swedish kronor to U.S dollar is about $78.00, I guess I saved some money on this one, and at least we did not get rooked in to buying multiple releases, which usually happens on the more popular titles, 6 months after 'Special Collectors Editions"" hit the streets.

You may be wondering what's so different in this FIFTH flavor of this incredibly smart 1982 sci-fi-noir dystopian classic? Content-wise, not that much. Image-wise, incredibly, it is even far, far more stunning than its predecessors. On larger screens, the viewer will feel as though it is almost an entire new experience. In fact, it would make for a superlative in-store test/demo disc. On THAT basis, it is certainly recommended for reviewing and/or repurchase.

Director Ridley Scott refused to substitute CGI - but rather held to an extraordinary clean-up of the original material. Bravo.

Apparently the five-disc box set from Warner Bros. (which includes all five versions and a cornucopia of extras) is the among the most lush and thorough treatment ever given any film - something that should give Criterion the jitters - and give the film's most obsessive devotees the final thrill of all.

SPOLIER: Oh yea, just in case you're part of the 10% that didn't get the word: Deckard's also a replicant (though he doesn't know it until the end of the film) and Gaff is the real Blade Runner - using replicants like Deckard to hunt other replicants down. When Gaff leaves an origami unicorn, he's revealing he knows Deckard's (implanted) memories.

You will not be disappointed if you buy this Collector's Edition. 5 different versions spread across 3 discs. With the 2 other discs holding a 3 and half hour documentary on the making of ""Blade Runner"", and the other having footage no one has seen since shooting took place in 1981.

This should be considered either blu-ray or dvd of the year for 2007. If you have a PS3, or a blu-ray player, you should really get this set. You will be enjoying it for years to come.

I've gone through some of the extra stuff, (interviews, deleted scenes, etc.) which was created with the same attention to detail as the movie, including the cool ""Deckard"" brief case and collector's items, like the ""silver"" origami swan that Edward James Olmos' character leaves for Deckard, and I really like it.

109406,5,0790729628,"This is the best edition you'd ever get. I prefer the Original Release  (also know as the International Cut, voice-over version, uncut version, or the Criterion Edition), because I like the idea that Deckard is certaintly human, and hence I find his romance with Rachel more intense and dramatic, since he has to struggle internally with the idea of falling in love with somebody/something he used to think of as a disposable machine; besides I must admit I like the voice-over, despite it was nailed by the executives at the end of the production, and that Harrison Ford was forced to did it, but it was the version that I first saw, and fell in love with. But if you like any other version (the main and most ""polished"" one is the Final Cut, which is similar to the 1992 Director's Cut), here you'll find 5 of them (there are actually seven). Definitely the most weird of them all, is the workprint version, since is the one that was shown in test previews. I think it's great that Ridley Scott decided to release all these versions so you could pick the one you like the most, instead of forcing everyone to stick to one version.

I remember that when I first saw the film that I had a little trouble figuring out what was going on and needed the narration to help me along, I might have been a little young maybe (12 or 13), but I imagined I'd have been lost without it. Fast forward to 1993 and I finally get to see it on the big screen but it felt hollow without the narration, I'd seen it many times by then and didn't need it, but I still missed it's charm. Then when the DVD came out, there were no plans for a narrated version, so I had to keep a hold of a VHS copy way longer than I ever kept a hold of a VCR. Finally we have the Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition and was it worth the wait. A shiny new version of the film sans narration but fantastic (I'm still on the fence about the ""I want more life father"" line change; I'd agree it fits better, but I loved saying it the other way for the last 20+ years....) and for the old curmudgeon in me I've got the original release. If I had to show it to a new viewer, I'd give them the new version without hesitation and keep the old version, my version, for myself.

Actually, this has five DVDs, numerous versions of the film, plenty of hours of extras and featurettes, and a few cool touches like a plastic model spinner toy.  (You've been waiting for that baby for years).  Bear in mind, only the 'Final Cut' of this film is 'improved' with tweaks to the effects and audio (very minor and nothing like the Lucas Star Wars fixes).

But finally, we have all of the known Blade Runner cuts that obsessists are familiar with: the Theatrical Version ('82 US), the International Version, the Director's Cut, and new 'Final Cut', and most rare, the Workprint Version, by far the most different from the rest.  There's also deleted footage, a feature documentary, featurettes, and trailer and TV spots and all that good stuff.

For the Blade Runner fan, and there are now legions, this is a must.  They've released the 'Final Cut' in a number of different versions (four and five disc), but this is the most obsessive, geekiest, and best of the them.  I mean, you get a model spinner and even notes in a mock folder police folder.  And you can carry the mock 'Voight Kampff' test briefcase around the house with you until Ridley Scott realizes he has some other changes to make.

Highly recommended, of course, if only for the little unicorn (forget to mention that).",1201996800,,1503,4.702290076335878
109431,1,0790729628,"Since I only have this movie on the Criterion laser disc, I have been waiting for the International version to be released ever since DVDs first appeared. I have no interest in any other cuts, second thoughts or pandering to fashionistas. I was thrilled to read about the many digital 'fixes' to both sound and picture that were supposed to be coming in the final versions to be released on DVD. Imagine my shock and surprise after purchasing this set when I discovered that I had been ripped off by Ridley Scott, Charles de Lauzirika et al in that the International version has not been improved one iota! It is hardly better than the version on laser disc. The advertising was and is dishonest and misleading. If possible, I would have liked to buy just the one version that I first saw in 1982 and haved loved ever since but crass commercialism has obviously triumphed and I feel comprehensively ripped off.

I have experienced only honesty and professionalism since I first began dealing with amazon well over fifteen years ago. I suggest that you should make it clear to potential purchaser's of this package that they will only get an improved version of Ridley Scott's current thinking which will not necessarily include an improved version of the movie they really expect and want. I have read Phillip Dick's novel and none of the filmed releases adheres to his novel in any respect so I do not want to enter into any arguments as to which version is 'correct', I just love the version I first saw even though I did try to watch the first attempt at a Director's cut and was unmoved by it.",1201910400,9,1597,4.603508771929825

The image and sound quality is even better than what I experienced in the theater because the print in the theater was probably old and degraded. They really gave this high definition DVD the ultimate treatment when doing the transfer and it shows.

Aside from all the extras like diferent versions of the film, the work print, the interviews and the commentaries (which all rock) the experience of this film is stunning! On my 60 inch HDTV I feel like there is nothing better.

I don't want to repeat what you can read in other reviews, but simply state my impression of this collection. For the casual fan you can buy a standalone copy of the Final Cut and be happy. The directors cut dvd was good but the sound quality was lacking. This final cut version not only sounds amazing but looks even more stunning if that was even possible. With the new sound you can hear things not heard before or easily noticed in the prior version. There is also the long awaited commentary track from Ridley Scott.

For the serious fan or film maven, this collection is a must. The documentary Dangerous Days is one of the best most comprehensive behind the scenes features I have ever seen. I couldn't stop watching it. It has been created and edited with meticulous attention to detail and features interviews with many people connected to the film. Then you've got yet another disc with even more excellent features. And then just when you've got all four versions of the film, you get yet another with the workprint!

I think however that there is yet one more version of this film that could be seen. The Dangerous Days feature says that there was a first pass of the film once they initially put it together. I'm guessing it was probably at least 2.5 hours long. I would love to see that one too!",1201910400,,1394,4.5059288537549405

SKIP the director commentary-Scott likes to pat himself on the back about how great he is, and talks non-stop about Alien.  About a third of the way through it drove me so crazy I had to switch the commentary to the second track, which consists of writers and is more entertaining and interesting (and they talk about this movie, NOT Alien).

109441,5,0790729628,"When the five disc Complete Collector's Edition of Blade Runner was released in December it was a cause for rejoicing among the many Blade Runner fans who made Ridley Scott's 1982 film a cult hit. The film, based upon Phillip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was a critical failure when it was released but with constant tweaking by the director has reached cult status. The presentation offered in this package is probably the must complete coolection of edits and variations of any film on the market today and Warner Brothers must be commended for the effort put forth here.

The package opens with the 2007 Final Cut of the film. Introduced by Scott as his perferred cut the film features added materials (albeit one short scene) resynched dialogue in a few scenes and a face replacement that was long overdue in another critical scene. The Final Cut is essentially the Director's Cut of the 1982 International Version without the voice over. The Final Cut features three commentaries: by Scott;by writers Hampton Fancher and David Peeples with added comments by Producer Michael Deeley and Production Executive Katherine Haber; and by the films design team including Syd Mead, Laurence Paull, David Snyder, Douglas  Trumball and others.

The Second Disc features the 3.5 hour making of feature Dangerous Days. This film interviews all of the surviving member of the cast and crew and presents possibly the most in depth making of feature I have ever seen.

Disc Three is the film archive and presents the three versions of the film that  have been seen in theatres up to now. This was one of the reasons that I bought the set. It is here that the casual viewer finally gets the  long unavailable Theatrical Cut from 1982. This is the version with the voice over narration that Ridley Scott is so critical of. This version has many fans and there have been complaints over the years about its lack of availability. In my own view this is the version that I  perfer the best having only been able to see the ""Director's Cut"" in the late 1990's. The International Theatrical Cut (1982)is  presented next with its few seconds of added violence. This version also contains the voice over narration. The 1992 Director's Cut minus voice over and with the infamous added unicorn scene rounds out the disc.

Disc Four is titled Enhancement Files and contains a plethora of bonus features divided into three catagories: Inception, Fabrication and Longevity. These may be played all together or separately. If played together make sure that you go back and listen to the audio only interview clips with writer Phillip K. Dick for his unique insight on the production. There are also three separate features on the importance of the poster design, a discussion of whether Harrison Ford's character is really a replicant and a discussion on the film's influence on other filmakers.

Disc Five contains the rarely seen Workprint Version of the film. This version with some 70 plus variations from the released versions is closer in spirit to the Final Cut. Do not miss the commentary on this version by author Paul Sammon. Sammon wrote Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner and his commentary is probably the best of the four commentaries presented. Also on this dis is the featurette All Our Future Varients detailing the  differences between the versions and the Final Cut.

All in all this is a detailed set which may be too much for the more casual fan but it does give a complete look into the making of the film and is highly recommended.",1201564800,3,3551,4.831960461285008

109444,5,0790729628,"This is all that can be had of what may be the most important adaptation of Philip K. Dick science fiction.  Other authors have had their work explored in various forms of cinematic style, but none seem better suited to the original work than approach of Ridley Scott.  He had an understanding of this stuff!  From Dick's philosophical underpinnings to his use of imagery and metaphor, Scott managed to get it all into this film.  All of it comes through in the several versions, but you can view them all and decide which has what advantages.  From the first theatrical release to the foreign version, the storied work-print, and the enhanced Final Cut, it's all here.

The originality of the production and the dedication to the work of the author hampered some of the commercial appeal of the first release, mostly due to the studio getting nervous about audiences being able to ""understand"" it and modifying it badly. But the director and fans have perservered to get all there exists of usable footage included in this set.  Finally, there can't be any moaning about what could have been because it's now been put together so that all of us can see what has only been rumored or in such limited release that we could hardly imagine what the discussion of ""better"" versions might have been like.

The only thing that could have made this better would have been some candid commentary in a discussion between Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford about all of the versioning and hacking at the originally filmed material.  The infamous studio interference in this masterpiece and what it took to bring it around to where at least the director was satisfied with it should be a part of the history included in this set.  But not everyone wants to be frank.",1201478400,2,1751,4.711475409836066

After you are done watching the bonus features you will know more about blade runner than you ever thought possible. The only downside to the collection is that disks 2 and 4 (the making of and bonus features) are standard dvd and not blu-ray. The advantage of this is that if you have an upscaling player you can at least upscale to 1080 unlike the special features on Pirates 2 which were on a blu-ray disk and therefore unable to be upscaled.

I think that Harrison Ford's flat delivery of the voice-over emphasizeed the idea the he was a burned out cop. I really did not get that in the non-voiced-over version. One man's trash is another man's treasure.

Although, I was not extremely interested in the other versons of the movie, I think that it is important to include them as part of the whole Blade Runner saga. I feel as if I got more than my money's worth in this",1201392000,5,667,4.558333333333334

The best thing about it is it's look - the vision of future LA as a sort of hell with huge pyramidal apartment blocks, floating video ads in English/Spanish/Japanese, and artificial humans and animals remains haunting.  Make sure you watch it in a dark room - the sun is never shining.  Harrison Ford is at his offhand macho best.  This film takes Philip K. Dick's novel in places it didn't originally go, making the viewer question what makes us human.  Add in some slam-bang action, and you have a classic.

One that made you use your brain. Although the gimmick is nice and you get all 5 versions including the work print, I was slightly disappointed at Mr. Scott's commentary. No real discussion about the movie and why he did this or that or why this was symbolic of this or that. Just a regurgitation of what was in the supplementary documentaries. I got more from Rutger's insight about the film or from the actors/writers than I did the director. Too bad he didn't take the time to really give us a sense on why he did what he did. Then the set would be really complete. But you do learn quite a lot from the supplementary material to keep this a definitive collectors set.",1201392000,2,824,4.357142857142857
109455,1,0790729628,"I would guess that just about every film ever made has production flaws also known as ""goofs"" on the IMDB. Blade Runner is no exception. However as another reviewer had stated ""I thought is was a classic back in 1982"", I would strongly agree. The updated 25th version production crew did an excellent job regarding  correcting the flaws, but it is a totally different film than the original 1982 version. This is my list of complaints: 1) The digital scanned print made the 25th version look synthetic and digital not analog, 2) The colors were very saturated (1982 film stock does not look this way), 3) The interview production footage did not fit with the mood of the original film. It had a boring set design and to much emphasis was put on the cast and production crew members talking. I would have prefered voice overs with stills and actual production footage. Every extra on every DVD produced that I've seen uses the same interview format. Very unoriginal. The extra items in the case like the Spinner model, the Origami unicorn etc. were cheap and not worth the wait. I would have prefered a solid production book with quality stills of never before published production images. I think that what makes something a classic is the human component and ""flaws"" within the subject or object. The original should have been left alone. What's next, removing brush hairs from the canvas of a Dali painting because they don't belong there?",1201305600,10,1441,4.78714859437751
109456,5,0790729628,"There is a ton of reviews for this blu-ray disc but I shall leave one anyway. The first time I saw this film was mid 80's on VHS and from the moment I saw this film I was smitten by the pure unadulterated style of the production and the enchanting electronic score. The score now sounds only slighty dated possibly only due to me remembering 80's, the style however seems all the more potent now, with the visions of decrepit vistas and deviant weather paterns giving visions of the future 25 years after the original release.
There are probably a few people looking for a true adaptation of P. K. Dick's book (Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?) and if you do you will be sorely dissapointed as there is virtually no resemblance to the original text. I would recommend the film however to even those who have read the book (detach yourself from the text) and to those who are not science fiction enthusiasts as there is plenty in this film for all who watch. with unmatched art direction, cinematography, and direction  to name but three, this is however let down by slightly patchy acting and some stilted dialogue.
The weaknesses are however out weighed by the strengths, with a superb score and a must see final scene that is amongst the best on celuloid. This Blu-ray version is superb value for the cost and is an immaculate transfer with the 'final cut' of the film being an extremely clean version of a very slightly tweaked version of the 1992 directors cut. This coupled with just about every other version of the film and a healthy dose of extras makes for good value. (this version also works in the UK)(sorry for the poor spelling)

109458,5,0790729628,"The movie is so great because it combines many layers:
(*) A philosophical discussion about what makes people human.
(*) An action movie
(*) A truly ""hard-core"" Science fiction creation - Ridley Scott creates a whole futuristic world, with incredible attention to detail. No shortcuts.
(*) A horror movie. Blade runner in genre is close to Dr. Frankenstein and other ""we made a creature in our image, but flawed - because people are flawed, because playing God is arrogant and has nasty repercussions, ... - and now they are out to get us""
(*) Film Noir. Deckard is played brilliantly by Harrison Ford as a classic noir detective - Hard on the outside, but compassionate on the inside. With of course the iconic raincoat.  Rachael is mostly ""lost soul"" and not ""Femme Fatale"", but her look is totally Femme Fatale.

As Sci-Fi, Blade runner is very far from the ""classic"" Star Trek universe with it's bright optimism [unless you're an Ensign. The Ensigns tend to have a high mortality rate], and totally unrealistic Star-Trek semi-magic technology : faster than light travel, transporters, people getting injured in one episode - and magically appearing good as new by the next episode. The star-ship Enterprise takes a terrific beating - and returns in mint new condition for the next episode.
Blade runner on the other hand is much more realistic. Now this may seem illogical - after all there are flying cars and replicants who are androids with the ability to put their hands in frozen and in boiling water and incredibly strong.
However Ridley's world is grimy and used and frayed. A replicant or person once shot is injured - no ""magic self healing"".
The costumes are futuristic - but based on 40s styles and combinations of existing fabric.
So with all the futuristic and ""non-real, Sci-Fi stuff""  - it's also ""40s Noir"" with the Sci-Fi added to make it visually fascinating but without detracting from the real-world feel.

The 4 disk edition contains Tons of excellent extras - like a comparison of the movie to the book Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep, how the ""Look"" of the movie was created, commentaries, etc.

But now, a Blu-Ray release with all of these extras, a final version cut with all of the other versions? I had to get it. And with Amazon's price so cheap, it was a must. On to the movie... Epic. I've seen it twice now. First I saw the newest cut so did not know what was missing. Then recently went back to view the original. And there is definitely a difference in getting some insight on the humanity of the lead. No spoilers but wow. Not that something is said directly, but with what's presented, you can use your imagination or assumption that something is true.

Watching Blade Runner is like watching modern Sci Fi being born, so much was influenced by this seminal film.

109466,5,0790729628,"Now I'm not going to lie... this is one of the cooler DVD packages out there today! The set contains five DVDs, (one more than the regular special edition) production designs and production stills, a movement cell, a ""Spinner"" replica, and an origami unicorn replica. Everything is topped off with a signed plastic letter by the director, Ridley Scott. On top of that, there are only a limited supply of suit cases (designed after Harrison Ford's in the film) and each one has it's own identification number on the bottom, unique to each case.
Seem like overkill?
Well, let's talk a little bit about the film itself. The story revolves around a special policeman/bounty hunter (Blade Runner Unit), who has been assigned to eliminate 4 murderous androids who have made it back to earth from an off-world colony. The androids, known as replicants, have only a certain amount of time to live; for their specific model 4 years. However, as we progress through the story, we begin to see the desperate goal of the replicants: to obtain more life. The plot writhes around different concepts of what make us human, and of course, what doesn't.
The original release of the film contained a narration that many believe to have been a bad choice. The ending is happier, and the scenes are shortened.
The directors cut, released some time later, contained a different (better) ending, no narration, and lengthened scenes.
The final cut, released this year, takes the directors cut, and makes it the definitive vision of Ridley Scott. For those worried that it will be too much, don't worry. It's not a whole lot different, however, it has some extending scenes that are worth seeing. Be warned however, this version is rather gruesome.
Overall, this package is remarkable. For the price you will pay, it is more than worth it. It even includes the extremely rare rough cut of the film, and a never-before seen documentary and deleted or alternate scenes.

109478,5,0790729628,"(the review below was originally written on Yahoo! movies on Apr 17th, 2005)

I came to know about this movie from the track 'Love theme' (by Vangelis) that I randomly heard on an internet radio station not too long ago. It was a really great composition and made me interested in the movie. I read some reviews on imdb and almost all of them were very positive. So when I got hold of the Director's Cut DVD yesterday and started watching, my expectations were pretty high. In most of my past experiences in such cases, I hadn't been totally satisfied at the end. But surprisingly, that wasn't the case with this movie. It's amazing.. surely one of the best movies ever made. It's a sci-fi, but obviously not one of those movies that don't go beyond laser gun firing and strange looking creatures. It has a very touching human side to it, something which most movies of this genre lack. It is most definitely a cult movie and a milestone in the art of movie making.

I'm particularly impressed by the direction. Ridley Scott did such an excellent job of portraying a future LA. Nothing seems far-fetched, rather I can't help but wonder about how immaculate his vision was even about twenty five years ago. The movie is dark, bleak and atmospheric. All the main characters are depicted beautifully. Their inner conflicts, vulnerability, pride, fear, love, hatred - seems like a canvas painted with human emotions. Not often do we find such depth in character development, especially in sci-fi's. It's not just a movie, it's more like a poetry in motion. Who can forget that quote of Roy before he dies: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain."" And the music by Vangelis is exquisite.

This is most probably my favorite movie of all time. Definitely a masterpiece, in all sense of the term. A movie much ahead of its time..",1200960000,,2000,4.660056657223796
109479,5,0790729628,"The image is stunning.  The movie is mostly the same, but with a couple of needed corrections -- the best being they corrected the scene where Joanna Cassidy gets shot (the first retirement).  In the original it was painfully obvious when they cut to the stunt woman, bad wig, wrong face easy to see because it was slow motion.  In the Final Cut they have gone back and digitally replaced the stunt woman's head with Madam Cassidy's.  Quite cool.  Plus the horrible voice over is still gone.  However, for those of you that liked it (groan) the original '82 release is included.  That plus all of the Special Featuers make this a worthwhile purchase.

Lets go back to the beggining, the original theatrical release, featuring Ford's V.O., and ""happy"" ending, a film at first not well recieved, becomes the reference piece for the international release, a more violent bleak film that got more praise when director Ridley Scott decided to re-release the film as his first dir. cut, now without the V.O., as well as the shortened, dark ending and opens a whole new can of worms, as a newly added scene of Harrison's Dekkard dreaming of a unicorn gives audiences a hint that he too may be a Replicate! which brings us to Scott's final masterpiece, now completley remastered in video and sound, with several little ""gems"" repaired, including seeing Joanna Cassidy falling thruogh the glass windows! also starring Brion James, Edward James Olmos, Rutger Hauer, and Sean Young.

To get all the goodies I speak of you must purchase the 5 disc set, but it is worth it...it comes in a very cool spy suitcase with the title on the outside...and inside has many collector lithographs along with descriptions of what is on each disc and background information...don't miss out on this one!",1200873600,,555,4.55

My main complaint about this product, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I purchased the HD DVD version and I expected HD quality.  Though it was in HD format, the picture was as grainy as an average quality normal DVD formated movie...in fact I've seen less grainy normal DVD movies.  If you're going to port something over to HD format, enhance the qualtiy to take advantage of the improved resolution.

The unusually high caliber TWIN PEAKS gold box set(FINALLY!)Anchor Bays phenomenal Jodorowsky compendium and now what is sure to be the final word on THE most influential film of the past 3 decades in the 5 disc BLADE RUNNER collection.  This is a film that a generation of filmmakers, cyberpunks, and overall movie lovers have lived and breathed in its many incarnations in other films, televsion or music video.  Without going into to much detail on influences Pirates of the Caribbean 3 wouldn't look the way it does without the heavy influence of Blade Runner and its art direction and overall asthetic.
I have tried many times to relive the first ""Sleeper"" showing at midnight when my eyes and ears were opened to this new cinema, but inferior VHS incarnations and lack of projection prevented this. With this 5 disc set and the proper sound and projection setup I can now achieve cinematic bliss once again, even if my eyes are 25 years older now.  The extras included here are fascinating if you share my relish for pre CGI cinema and its production then this is a virtual bonanza, the workprint is a little underwhelming in presentation but they did their best and I love that it is included.  The real final straw that pushes this set to the top of the heap is the incredible deleted scenes reel that plays like a mini version with alternate voiceover narration that is a boon for those of us that enjoy Ford's wooden noir delivery over their groundbreaking visuals.  The workprint disc is misprinted in a few sets (mine) and I found that the final cut disc had rough edges and ran loudly in my PS3, other than the mild production hiccups this was worth waiting for as the extras and reshoots and documentaries all go into making this the DEFINITIVE release that it is.

I have watched the entire collection and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The commentary is a bit dry and really only for those who like watching the History Channel (I do) but it gives the background to what the director was trying to convey and the struggle involved in making the movie.  Blade Runner was a film ahead of its time and it spawned a generation of film makers that were inspired by its darker vision of the future.  The movie was loosely based on the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" and was endorsed and enjoyed by the book's creator.

One question that this version answers is the question, ""Is Deckard an android as well?""  To find the answer to that question you have to get this DVD and watch the commentaries.",1200787200,,956,5.604166666666667

If you're buying this set, then you already know that.  The cool brief case, the toys inside, blah, blah blah.  A dream come true, all of it, sure.  But what turns out to be the best part?  Two words:  Dangerous Days.

For rabid fans of the movie, the ones who immersed themselves in the conspiracy theories and the history of the movie.  The fans who obsessed over Paul Sammon's ""Future Noir"".  Dangerous Days is one of the most comprehensive ""Making of"" features I have ever seen.  Over 3 hours long, covering the genesis of the movie from the novel through it's release.  The new interviews, not only with cast, but also the producers, Ridley himself, but most importantly, the crew.  It's just remarkable hearing from the art department responsible for what has become one of the most visually influential movies of all time.

The beauty about the good science fiction it's that craft a poetic view of our self, a world were we can achieve the edge of our potential.

Here we are talking about one of the most influential pictures in all the movie history.  ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""The Matrix"", ""Akira"", ""The Fifth Element"", and many others, don't exist whit out this Sci-fi epic, that's put the cyberpunk literary genera on movies (please don't William Gibson forget ""Neuromancer"" as indispensable contribution of the genera) , and established its self as a cannon.

More than 25 years after its release this movie looks all brand new. like Citizen Kane, Casablanca or Lawrence of Arabia, because like any other truly master peace it's a reflection of his own time, also it is a critic, to all the previous and subsequent art, at the same time it is a critic to itself, that's why the real classics are above of time and space and always feels alive.

Ridley Scot creates an indispensable cult reference. understand perfectly Phillip K. Dick short story (besides he refuse to ever read the original story), and all the Sci-fi of the 60's and 70's, we present a perfect distopia, like any boroughs character, Dekard is tiered of the decadence sounded him, besides that, but in a small way the big corporations made some small rolls, you can see, trade marks like Coca-Cola, Panam, Malboro, and many others.

 He used technology as a stetic and artistic element also as part of the narrative structure. The incredible and retro productions design, set decoration, the avant garde special effects, the cloths, the vehicles, the voight kamp treatment device, in resume, any visual idea, any object in film transport you to a dream reality, to a nostalgic space in side your brain.

Harrison Ford and Rutter Hauer crafted awesome performances. Also, the rest of the cast are perfect, I can not imagine any other actor to play the role of some of which they appear in the film.

The groundbreaking soundtrack of the Vangelis, put the right atmosphere. When you hear the music its make you feel like if you're  looking to a Rene Magritte canvas. Its the world that you see whit your eyes every day, but something it is not correct in some subconscience level, and annoying you in a very subtle way, also developed in side you the sensation of expansion whit out not boundaries.

This its truly science fiction, no fantasy like Star Wars (I am saying this not as an insult, its only editorial comparation), because Blade Runner talks about human condition, if you read the screen play and tray to made a resume of the plot, you only would see the history of a police officer who tray to kill some replicants (androids), but if you made a reflection, you will see that this picture represents the internal and eternal fight to try to define the essence of the human condition, using a futurist scene and characters in parts of robots with human actions and emotions to make patent the point in comment, all time  you know that robots don't exist, as they appear in the movie, but at the same time you can't avoid to identify your self whit the characters, and to see with greater clarity your own complexity in the process.

The plastic unicorn and the ""spinner"" car are more like kids' toys than objects of serious value, but they are fun none-the-less. And the folder of lobby-style cards are nice. The really strange item, namely the 3-D plastic film strip sandwiched between two clunky pieces of clear acetate seemed curiously out of place and overdone. One might easily decide it was included just to add weight. A thin, lightweight laminated version would have sufficed just fine. The suitcase is large enough to add some of your own stuff, which is what I did. The special three-CD Vangelis music album fits perfectly with a little rearrangement. And the CDs are (coincidentally?)printed with the same special logo that appears on the DVDs themselves, for anyone who cares to notice.

The making of disc shows that the film makers didn't like the book. The final screenwriter says it's short on narrative. It's Scott's vision.
It perpetuates the myth that humans come first. That isn't true in the book. In the book, being human doesn't make one a better human. In the movie the bots are just vicious killers. They should be wiped out.
Having said that, it is still one of the best examples of set decoration and production values ever filmed. Alas not much else.",1200700800,2,673,4.265625

The documentary 'Dangerous Days' (disc two) will immerse you in the epic saga that was the making of Blade Runner and covers every aspect in great detail. It is also nice to have the original theatrical cut with the voice over (which I always liked) in addition to the '92 Directors cut and Ridley Scott's Final Cut. The Final Cut itself is at once immense and stunningly beautiful in picture and sound, and it's great that we finally have Scott's definitive vision of this landmark film. Also of interest will be the Workprint on disc five - a 'rough sketch' of the film, you might say, that also has not been widely seen.

109528,4,0790729628,"The ultimate Bladerunner DVD set is a good purchase for the serious fan. Addressing all the extra collectibles that come with it, I think it is worth the $30 jump in price from the 4-Disc version. I only saw a description of those elements beyond the 5 discs listed recently. The briefcase is an entertaining piece of packaging and I admit to being very fond of the models of the car and orgami unicorn. The interior of the case is well organised and configured. The setup is attratcive enough that I have had no desire to even remove the hologram block or the screencards from the compartment. That being said, this is really only meant for the obsessive fan and understandable why it is a limited edition. For 90% of the people considering purchasing Bladerunner, they should just stick to the 4 Disc set.

As to the film, the final cut print is quite exquisite and very satisfying. The technical changes they made are very well done and in a much more organic way then say some of the new effects in the updated Star Wars trilogy. I will say that having 5 versions of the film gets to be a bit too much. However the bonus features are where I think the real strength lies. The 3.5 hour documentary on the film's history is totally comprehensive and enthralling. It's structured into multiple parts and has a good narrative format that evokes the movie to a certain degree. Almost all the major members of cast and production are interviewed. The interviews are highly informative and revealing. There is a willingness by all to be honest and discuss the problems and the uglier aspects of the film's history before, during and after its production. People are candid without being incindiery or insulting. The doc is so insightful that a fair amount of the audio commentaries seem redundant or unnecessary. And there are at least 3 of them.

The more technical based features dealing with the film production are very educational and well documented without being bloated or too long to make you lose interest. This is a problem I find with DVDs covering more recent special effects movies. They include a rare radio interview with the late Philip K Dick that is a pleasure to hear. They also address the issue of the book vs the movie and the question about Deckard and this is also done honestly with plenty of disagreement.

Any other issues I have with the DVD set up is minor. I would have preferred a little user friendly setup on the arrangement of the bonuses and the activation of commentaries. Also the flickering camera grid gets annoying after a while. Been nice if they were not on every menu.",1200614400,2,2609,4.642857142857143

I have purchased each new release of Blade Runner as they were offered and enjoyed every variation that Sir Ridley Scott has provided.  Immediately following the first commercial that I saw for the ""Final Cut"" package (at 11:30PM) I jumped up from the couch and ordered it from Amazon.  When it arrived I was so impressed with the package that I ordered a second one for a friend.  Seeing the remastered ""Final Cut"" edition on my new 42 inch HDTV is an experience beyond words.  It is truly one of the finest and most enduring science fiction films of all time.  Thank you Amazon and thank you Sir Ridley!",1200528000,2,792,4.465277777777778

This film almost never came on cable (if it did I never saw it) and I said finally I'm buying in for HD DVD; and the results are amazing!  Its kind of hard to imagine this film being a 1982 film, it looks like it was made in the late 90s or something.  The picture is nice and crisp and its sci-fi entertainment at its best.  The only indication that this was an old film was the original sound recording from the 80's era.  Still sounds really good, especially the score.

You get 5 discs loaded with extras for only $27.95, its well worth every penny and more!!!  Now I am definitely looking for more Ridley Scott films to be released in High Def, namely Legend and American Gangster!",1200528000,,910,4.311764705882353

The picture is sharper than a blade, with many details and nice colors. Even the 640 kb/s DD track is deep and includes lots of elements creating a surrounding experience quite impressive for 25-year-old movie.
Then, the 5-disc edition builds a ""complete dossier"", including all the different cuts of the film in a nice quality (if you only knew the power of preserving all cuts from the dark side...): even the workprint version, with the poorest picture, remains viewable. A large amount of bonus material is provided, including ""Dangerous Days: The Making of Blade Runner"" which last longer than the film itself!
All this allows to become a full ""Blade Runner""-geek! Anyway, even after the release of the ""Final Cut"" (which bring interesting elements), the major cut changes faced by the movie are still the voice over and the ending opposing the 1982 releases to the workprint/1992-false-dir's-cut/final-cut family.

However, A lack of time and money kept it from being finished. Also, the film's backers added a horrible voice-over and a ridiculous happy ending, and they deleted the unicorn scene. The fans are responsible for this film finally being completed. There were enough of them to make it profitable for the owners of the film to put-up the money to bring director Ridley Scott back to apply the final polish to his masterwork. This is a real improvement over the so-called ""Director's Cut""-technical mistakes have been corrected, dialogue has been added and or changed and additional editing has tightened the film. The print, sound and music have also been up-dated. Overall, we now have a smoothed-out narrative and this is the shortest of all the many versions of the movie. This is now a perfect film! When ""Blade Runner"" first came out as a butchered and unfinished movie, it was generally dismissed. The release of the improved ( the voice-over and stupid happy ending were removed and the unicorn scene was added), but still rough ""Director's Cut"" led to a favorable critical re-appraisal and eventually placed the film among the 100 greatest films of all time.

After seeing some previous Special Editions/Director's Cuts of Ridley Scott's films, I had an idea of what we might expect . It is hard to believe that some would still be unhappy with this incredible presentation of Blade Runner, but that is the way fans are.

The set (preordering through Amazon) cost me less than a third of the Australian price, so I cannot complain.

For those who have never seen it, the film is amazing and haunting , in some ways sad. I feel it means more as one becomes older. My only reservation about the film is the way it tries to be many things at once, but maybe that is its charm.
It is definitely a classic and perhaps those who don't like it don't like the underlying message which may be - think about yourself and what you have accomplished. Are you happy with that ?

If not, the film may be difficult to sit through.

So criminally I bought this version from the U.S of A for less than the 2 disc Blu-ray version in England including delivery, No it didin't make sense to me either.

Now the review, I have to say they have done a superb job on remastering the picture and the audio on the final cut. Ridley's vision is there on screen sharp and so detailed and through uncompressed PCM, wow does the whole soundscape hit you, especially Vangelis's electrifying score.

Why only four out of five? Well, I was disapointed the two of the discs were ordinary dvd's, although both documentary / extra discs, I would have loved to seen them in hi def, especially the Dangerous Days doc, OK so it ran for three and a half hours but so does Kingdom of Heaven and it doesn't need to be the best compression rate ever.

Besides from that all I can say is if you love Bladerunner, you already have bought it.

if you like Bladerunner, then buy it and if you have never seen it then this is a grand place to start.

  I only just received my copy of Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] today 1/15/08. I was totally blown away with this version on blu ray. I still own the VHS version (My door stopper)and the DVD version which i watch occasionally. I must say from the very first scene the PQ and SQ was superb! This is a must have if you are a fan of this movie. It will probably take me another week to go through the other four disc.

  I'm from Australia,this title has yet to be release on Blu ray. Don't really know why? This title was due for realease last year in Australia on blu ray in November but then it was sad to hear the release date was ""unknown"".I just wish these big studio like WB would get their acts together and release titles like they say.

The extras discs have all kinds of goodies for those who dig deep enough. The screen tests for the roles of Pris and Rachel are great, showing several different actors that tried for the roles, as well as Sean Young and Daryl Hannah's tests. Also of interest are the many outtakes and deleted scenes. There is almost enough footage to make a completely different version of the movie! One particularly good scene is Harrison Ford and Sean Young's lovemaking  session toward the end of the movie -- much ""hotter"" than the one that made it to the final cut. All I can say is ... WOW.

Current-day interviews with cast members were great, as well as the ""Making of Bladerunner"" mini-documentary that really gives you a taste of the Hollywood insanity that is involved in movie making. It's amazing this movie was ever made considering all the crap the director had to go through in dealing with producers and other meddlers.

If you're a fan of the movie in any capacity, I recommend this fervently.

The clarity of the picture, sharpness, sound, the tiny details, even in the darkness and the rain. It looks as if it has been shot yesterday.
I prefer Ridley Scott's final version, included here on disc one. It has several added and extended scenes which makes it all a little easier to understand. Although I admit this has become difficult to judge after having watched the film so many times.
Also included are the 82 international and US theatrical versions, the 92 director's cut and the workprint version. For details on these see amazon's description above.
I love Philip K. Dick's writing, so I was very happy to have a featurette and an audio interview included in the set.

The smokey, polluted LA is still there, but the edges are sharp like a cold, clear winter day.

109576,5,0790729628,"This five-DVD release is packed neatly into a small briefcase along with a toy spinner (a car), an origami unicorn, a hologram of Deckard at work, and examples of storyboard artwork.  It is ""quite a prize"" and something for Blade Runner fans to revel in.  If you feel that you don't need all of these goodies, however, you can still opt for ""Blade Runner - the Final Cut 2-Disc Special Edition,"" giving you the definitive 2007 version of Blade Runner, the documentary on the film (""Dangerous Days""), and more bonus material.

There are many Blade Runner reviews already posted and I risk being completely redundant.  I  saw it in its original theatrical release in June of 1982.  I didn't own a VCR so, with the idea I might never see this movie again, I went back to the theater the next day, pen in hand, and scribbled down as much dialogue as I could, including, of course, Roy Batty's iconic farewell speech.  I needed to keep it forever.

Blade Runner is set in Los Angeles in 2019.  I recognize my city:  the storefronts, street crime, red horizon, endless skyline and congestion.  The grimy rain depicts a city of dashed hopes and depression, yet Blade Runner ultimately discovers a passion for life that is ""genetic."" Roy Batty became my hero by defying his world.

If you are new to Blade Runner I recommend watching the original 1982 Theatrical Release first.  I believe it is closer to the mark than is now acknowledged.  My hands down ""favorite,"" however, has become the 2007 Final Cut.  It is reworked to repair the slip-ups and also expanded somehow, taking a little more time and revealing the film's soul.  I discovered Pris in this version -- her conversations with Sebastian reveal tenderness and compassion.

Another version of interest in this set is the Workprint.  It uses an even clumsier voiceover than the 1982 Theatrical release and the second half of the film is scored with awful music, exposing the actors by removing the support of Vangelis' miraculous soundtrack.  Now we see what powerful performances these actors brought to the film:  Rutger Hauer, is absolutely real, terrifying, intelligent, physical; Harrison Ford truly brilliant in a difficult role where his contribution has become underrated.  Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, and Brion James are all great.  Thanks to each of you.  And thanks to Ridley Scott.

Blade Runner has become a classic and this collector's edition provides much to study and discuss.  I can throw away my scribbles now.",1199836800,2,2496,4.871733966745843

I don't think I have really 'seen' this movie until now; It was funny to listen to the people in the room constantly saying 'Whoa!' as each new scene began; The scenery, the neon, the smoke filled rooms coupled with blue beams of flickering light, the rain, the buildings...just amazing. True eye candy in every sense of the word. And of course the story and acting is top notch; I found myself feeling like I rediscovered an old friend; It is so much fun to see so many talented people in here, many very early in their careers. The dialog and story are just as strong as they have ever been, and it was nothing less that a pure joy to see this movie done up the way it should be.

But seeing this version, and after all these years, not even keeping the state of the art of 1982 in context, is an astounding experience. It is simply beautifully done. It all just seems so right. It is amazing how they have seemed to create something so whole and in some way, seamless and beautiful, and yet, gripping. And I've seen the darn thing (both versions) several times.

109588,5,0790729628,"I'm a big fan of both the movie and the CD soundtrack that is sold separately.

The four disc version of Blade Runner is the cheapest way to get all the versions of the movie.  Like many other reviewers I actually prefer the version with the voice over as well.  I makes Deckard just a tad more believable as a guy who is just a little fed up with the status quo.  The narration really communicates Deckard's attitude.  The ""Final Cut"" version has a much terser finish and gives up the happy ending of the original release.  Both are pretty good but gives the viewer two completely different feelings at the end of the movie.

Blade Runner was the first movie Ridely Scott released after the super successful Alien in 1979.  In fact, fans of Alien will recognize some of the same sound effects in Blade Runner.  Anyway, I think one of the reasons Scott compromised with the studios on the final cut for the 1982 release was that he wanted another hit.  Instead, Blade Runner really was a bit of a flop at the box office.  Whether ""the Final Cut"" would have been more successful from a financial perspective in 1982 is purely speculation.  Of course, we see it now for the profoundly insightful movie that it really is.

If only Emperor Lucas would come down from his ivory tower and give us the original Star Wars movies in an HD format.

The visual quality of the HD version is unbelievable.  I endured this movie on VHS.  It looked like it was filmed in fog.  It was obviously way ahead of the current technology.  HD does this film proud.

109591,5,0790729628,"MINDBLOWINGLY BRILLIANT!!!

This is why I got into DVD movies in the first place.  A chance to see delected scenes, commentary on the film by the creators, interviews, alternate takes on the film, special effects insites, costuming creation, art work and set design talks and anything else to accompany my favourite films.  To date, there has only been a handful of really value packed DVD titles, most notable were the Criterion collections 'Brazil' and Buckaroo Banzai adventures across the 8th dimension.  With all that space why only put the movie and maybe a trailer if your lucky?

Well here we have Blade Runner The Ultimate Collector's Edition and I just have to say it again fellow fans and new comers alike.  It's mind blowing.  Simply the best Blade Runner release EVER.  Period!!

This collection is worth 4 times the price.  In fact I probably paid that trying to hunt down the rare versions.  Oh how I wish I had simply waited for this.  Not only did I get better versions of all those poor quality bootleg releases I chowed down over the years, I got what I can only describe as 'bigger, better, more'.

Now that I've ranted I'd better review the material briefly.  What you get is 5 amazing discs that I strongly feel will put many manufacturers to shame and bring a new age of decent DVD releases increasing the bonus material to previously undreamed of heights, like the magnificient 'Blade Runner' release here.

The Final Cut, is simply stunning.  I'm going to make a point of emailing Ridley to thank him a million times over for going to great lengths in giving this unique film the treatment it so rightfully deserves.  The final cut is basically 'The Directors Cut' that came out in 1992, BUT with a few major additions.  There's an extra minute of footage but that's not what blew my mind.  It's the total touch up magic that has been pain stakingly carried out on the footage and the sound is FANTASTIC. I was always dissapointed with the Directors Cut sound, in that it was so stereo sounding.  The DVD release(of which I've given away upon aquiring this incredible treasure trove along with all my other dodgy versions), back in 1992 was also a major let down with next to nothing other than a trailer.  The Final Cut fixes all that with brilliant commentaries, a nice intro by Ridley Scott and did I mention the picture and sound are now positively top notch with not a single complaint from this hard core fan.  Oh and I should also mention your in for a treat with some nicely added affects and oh so perfect lighting.  Look I can't say anymore as I don't want to spoil it for those who have not yet seen this brilliant final cut.

If the bonuses on the first disc were not enough, there's 4, YES '4' extra DVD's chock a block full of Blade Runner goodness.  2 of these give you the other 4 versions of the film (not just transferred on a whim, ALL fixed up as best as they could be and given 5.1 channel sound enhancment), you get the 1992 directors cut, the 1982 US Theatrical Cut, the 1982 International Cut and something I've never been able to obtain.  The rediculously mega rare until now PRE-RELEASE WORKPRINT version of the film(this was the initial viewing film that was post theatre release).  I had to read the cover 4 times just to convince myself it was actually there, not to mention sit in astonishment starring at a title screen (my flat mate thought I had lost it when I apparently sat there for half an hour just looking at the screen afraid to push the play button).  Needless to say this is a VERY good thing.

If that wasn't fantastic enough, you get another 2 disc loaded to the brim with what I can only describe as a treasure trove of Blade Runner additions.  You get interviews with so many of the cast, you'll have to write down the names to keep track of them all, you get documentaries the likes of which rarely grace a film in such majestic splendor, stacks of footage highlighting the costuming, artwork, prop creations, Syd Mead's own spotlights and then....

Massive drum roll....  You get approximately(I still havn't counted them as I've only seen the first 5 and will need a viewing time just to view them),  about 20+ deleted scenes, so far all of them featuring amazing valuable footage I'd never seen nor heard of until now.  For example there's a scene were Deckard talks with Howard after his 'little' encounter with Leon.  I'll not describe it, if your a fan and you must be to have kept reading my ranting review, it's a must see, along with all  the other great pieces of footage which have now expanded the movie even further for me.

In a nutshell this collection is overpowering for the discs alone, combined with a trendy collectors brief case, replica polymer chromed Unicorn, art folder, motion film cell and a replica scaled police spinner car with vertically opening doors just like in the film that I can fly around with in my living room(YOU ROCK SYD!!!), it's simply beyond amazing value, quality and any other '...ity' you care to mention.

FLAWLESS DVD RELEASE (5 OUT OF 5), no problems what soever and anyone who whinges at this is either not a Blade Runner fan or a ludicrous individual who's either close to death or in fact a replicant.

Grab it while you can or you'll deffinately be left behind and forgotten like 'tears in rain'.",1199577600,3,5323,4.574894514767933
109592,3,0790729628,"This is for people who haven't watched all the versions (or any version).  If you are a long-time fan of the movie in one version or another, just skip this review because you'll probably hate it.

I heard about Blade Runner for many years but never got around to seeing it.  The final cut was my first exposure to the movie.  If you are like me, these are things you should know:

1.  It's dark.  Visually as well as plotwise.  I like noir films but have difficulty seeing dark & shadowy scenes, which in this case is most of the movie.  I think the larger & clearer you can see it, the better off you'll be.  If you've got a 20-year-old 26"" TV, bring the movie to watch with friends who have new, big TVs because you can't understand what you can't see.

2.  It's dark (again).  Deckard is the closest thing to a hero in this movie and he isn't exactly warm and fuzzy.  He doesn't express any more emotion than Rachel, the replicant with whom he falls in love (contributing to the ""is Deckard a replicant or human"" debate).  I think the reason they needed special tests to identify replicants wasn't because the replicants were so human but because all the humans were so robotic.  Ridley Scott portrays a future I hope we never see.  Very grim.  And it rained all the time in LA -- huh?

3.  It can be confusing.  As I understand, the original release had a Deckard voiceover added after screening audiences didn't like the movie.  I think the movie is stylistically better without a voiceover, but it can be hard for new viewers like me to catch all the details.  One scene in particular confused me:  Deckard was looking at a photo in his apartment that he kept enlarging and enhancing to find small details.  What was that about?  And then the added unicorn scene that followed (more fuel for the Deckard as replicant position) confused me more.  Again because of the visual darkness & my old TV, I had to go online to realize that the last object Deckard picked up was an origami unicorn (presumably left by the cop who made origami).  If you like movies all spelled out for you, you probably won't like this movie.

4.  No happy ending.  The original Deckard & Rachel escape to lovely woodsy places would be more ""feel good"" but make no sense if the Earth is so miserable people want to move off world.  The ending in this final cut is a bit abrupt for me.  They get into an elevator and all of a sudden the credits start, leaving me wondering what happened.  If you like happy endings, you'll be disappointed.

5.  Hard characters to like.  It may be that I missed something, but I didn't find anything in the replicants to make me empathize with them.  Roy has one moment of goodness after a violent and murderous swath through the movie.  If the goal of the movie was to make me think about what makes an organism a person who deserve rights to life, liberty, etc., I missed it.  I had no problem with Deckard killing the escapees.  Even Rachel, who was benign, gave me no reason to feel she should be treated as a human.  On the other hand, I didn't like any of the human characters much either.

I gave this movie 3 stars because I still don't know whether I liked it or not.  But I was intrigued enough that I might read the Philip Dick story or watch a version with voiceover narration and then come back to this version hoping to understand it better.",1199577600,5,3367,4.378640776699029

I have been a fan of this film for, well, 25 years and I my appreciation has just grown over the years.  After viewing the collectors edition though, I have a whole new outlook on this very influential movie.

For those other ""Blade-philes"" out there - I read Paul Sammon's book cover to cover and was only able to imagine all that he wrote about.  Now I was able to experience it first hand.  Not only do you get all these versions  of the movie (Theatrical, Director's cut, International cut, work-print , and Final Cut) but you also get hours of interviews from the actors, director, crew... you get screen tests, art work, behind the scenes footage, extra scenes - I mean it just goes on and on.  It is extremely thorough and the attention to detail is apparent in every respect - packaging, design, content etc... I'm sure Mr. Sammon must have had a hand in this release.  I still haven't finished watching every disc - it truly is the gift that keeps on giving !  Sorry to gush so much, I have never seen anything on the market that goes this in-depth with the making of a film before - and the fact that this much care went into a Blade Runner collector's edition is a dream come true!

The only thing that I don't see in this collection (maybe I just haven't gotten to it yet - but it doesn't appear in the booklet that describes the contents) is, surprisingly, any insight to the sound track.  I am not a big Vangelis fan, however, his work on the sound track was great and extremely appropriate (except for the awful end credits theme - really the only thing that dates this movie).

One last word - the Final Cut itself looks amazing - the restoration / enhancement was very noticeable.

It seems to me that the only low scores for this collection had to do will packaging deformities (i.e. missing discs etc...) and not the content it self.  In short, can't recommend it highly enough - a must have for any Blade Runner fan!",1199577600,,2127,4.379134860050891

The sets on Blade Runner do not suffer from the dreaded ""outdated technology set"" that often plagues science fiction movies after they have been out a while and this is attributable to Ridley Scott. The gritty Sci/Fi setting is perfect. The acting across the board is amazing.  The movie is full of iconic images and lines.  Leon alone has a couple iconic lines, ""Let me tell you about my mother"" and ""Wake up, time to die"" and who can forget the lines and image of Roy at the end of the movie?  Blade Runner is a timeless classic!

There is an updated version of the movie now available and would recommend that to fans of the movie and this version to people just wanting to add to their collection.",1199577600,2,745,4.448529411764706

109600,4,0790729628,"I was always amazed that the studios didn't issue a remastered version of Blade Runner with all of the extras at the same time that the Matrix came out on DVD.  Alas, it has finally arrived!  I've always been a HUGE fan of Blade Runner and I loved the Director's Cut that excluded the voice over.  I must say, however, that after reading some of the other reviews, I now fully understand why many might like the voice over.  The great thing about this release is that it includes both, so everyone should be happy.  I'm going to assume you are intimately familiar with the plot and move on to my review of this particular 4 disk release of Blade Runner.

The documentaries on the second and fourth disk are absolutely fabulous.  All of the cast members who are still alive are interviewed at length, as well as some who tried out for the roles of Rachel and Pris.  For those of you who are big fans of the movie and have been waiting for the story behind the movie, all of your questions are answered, and then some.

The fourth disk goes into details surrounding the cinematography and lighting, as well as a brief biography of Philip K. Dick which is revealing.  It covers the topics of cinematography and lighting in a way that are interesting to the lay audience (like me), but I imagine it could be quite academic for someone in the film industry who wants to understand how it was done before the days of CGI.  One of the young film makers interviewed said that he watches Blade Runner often, just to try and figure out how Ridley did the lighting, or got a certain cinematic effect, or what focal length a certain shot was made, etc.

The only problem I have is one of personal preference regarding an important change in dialogue in the Final Director's Cut in one particular scene.  What follows in the rest of this paragraph is a spoiler, so please skip this paragraph if you want all changes in the new version to be a surprise.  A key line near the end of the film between Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) and Tyrell (Joe Turkell), his ""maker,"" is changed in a way that I think dramatically changes the overall emotional impact of the film.  In the original, Tyrell asks Roy, ""What can he (your maker) do for you?"", and Roy responds, ""I want more life, f_ _ _ _ _!"" (insert expletive) In the new Final Director's Cut version, he says, ""I want more life, father.""  If you're only a casual fan, this probably won't bother you. In fact, you probably won't even notice it. But for those die-hard fans like me, it will come as a big shock.

While I really appreciated some of the other subtle changes, such as fixing the scene where Zora crashes through the glass - which now actually looks like Zora (Joanna Cassidy) and not her stunt double with a cheap wig, or how at the end of the movie Roy's pigeon no longer flies away into a blue sky - this change in dialog between Roy Batty and Tyrell is not in keeping with the mood and direction of the film in my opinion and I really question why Ridley Scott would make this change.  The original dialog was much edgier and much more in keeping with the original, dark nature of the film.  This new line seems like it would appeal to a ""kinder/gentler"" Blade Runner fan, which isn't me.

In spite of this one issue pertaining to the single line of dialogue between Roy Batty and Tyrell (strictly in my own opinion), I highly recommend this 4 disk release of Blade Runner for the absolutely fantastic interviews and documentaries, as well as the multiple versions of the film.",1199404800,2,3521,4.4294573643410855

109602,4,0790729628,"...except, as noted elsewhere on this page, hardly anything about the matchless score by Vangelis. A few minutes of stills of Vangelis, while Ridley Scott and others comment on the music, is all we get. Among the fans of Blade Runner, the music is inseperable from the film - and an interview with Vangelis would've seemed mandatory to me.

In the first few minutes of the movie,when Gaff's spinner is climbing up through the canyons between bldgs, and the Vangelis score takes over the soundtrack for a few moments - that is the moment when most people I know began a hypnotic freefall into the story. The music tells us this is a future of both progress and decay, just as poignantly as the equally matchless production design does. It looks like a future many of us have privately feared, and here it is, coming at you, like a ""post-modern cocktail of ecstasy and dread"", as William Gibson described cyberpunk in general.

Beyond that glaring exclusion (thus only 4 stars), the information and insights available here are great enough to interest even a non-BR freak. The featurettes all had me glued to the screen - seeing the actors as they look today, interspersed with various of their scenes from the film. (As others have pointed out, I can't understand why Joanna Cassidy isn't a much bigger star) The segment on the correcting of certain continuity errors for the Final Cut version was absoulutely fascinating. If you just want to learn a lot about movie making, these DVD's are required watching.

The story behind Rutger Hauer's iconic death scene, the smoky ambience, the lighting challenges and the numerous production design details that never made it onto film are all covered in the extras, and enable you to relive some of the movie's magic, that may have dimmed for you after multiple viewings over the years. Blade Runner is re-presented to us with flourishes and awe and affection from its creators,  that we've had to largely piece together for ourselves-until now. As I watched the interviews and documentaries, I found myself with a lump in my throat more than once-the same one I felt the first time I watched Roy Batty die.",1199404800,4,2150,4.802702702702702

This one disk is the earliest and best version of the story about the future detective tasked with running down a band of renegade replicants.  The replicants are purpose-built beings, almost human and in some respects super-human, and tracking them down raises questions about the nature of humanity and the self.  The bad thing about the product is that in order to get the real Blade Runner one must also get the disks for the re-edits, which all have unsatisfying endings that go against the grain of the basic story.  The reason for the peculiar history of Blade Runner DVD's is that the director and producer grossly overextended their budget and went bankrupt.  The completion company took over the mess, completed the film, and released it theatrically.  The film became a classic, but the original creators were miffed because the released film did not quite match their original vision (it was actually better, but they did not see that).  What ensued was a protracted fight about ownership rights.  The original director later produced and released significantly re-edited versions on DVD.

The special features are outstanding too, and I really appreciate the time and energy that must have been spent correlating all these interviews and fascinating facts.

However - and I feel bad making even one complaint about this release - but in all the 9 HOURS of special features there is HARLDY a mention on Vangelis's stunning score for Blade Runner. His work on this film was truly exceptional and I think the film would be a much less enjoyable experience without it. He really captured the brooding dystopia in his score. It really is a masterpiece of a score and I just find it such an oversight that there was NO focus on this within the myriad of special features. I understand that he's not one for interviews, but even a 10 min piece on the development and importance of his masterwork would have been much appreciated by fans... After all, he played such a massive roll in the emotion of this film.

I think scores in films are too often overlooked, which is a shame considering they add such a subliminally important roll in the emotion of film. A shame.

But I must end by saying WELL DONE to Warner Bros for an exceptional HD DVD release. Truly a stunner!",1199318400,3,1327,4.567226890756302
109607,5,0790729628,"Those who don't love this film won't understand why you'd want a grand slamming total of FIVE cuts of one movie.  Considering how much time I spend  criticizing multiple releases, I don't know why I would either.  Except for this one.  ""Blade Runner"" was an enigma during its first U.S. run.  It created a gritty, dysfunctional, and totally real future.  It was difficult in the extreme to watch and understand, with the many layers of story, graphics, and complex characterizations.  It created the last great ""film noir"" in the most unlikely of settings.  And it was bleak.  My Lord, it was bleak.  This was a Los Angeles that no one in their right mind would want to live in, even if given a chance of a happy ending that Deckard seemed to get.

The dystopia as replacement to a bright and shining tomorrow was a touchstone idea, and drove the popularity of the ""Cyberpunk"" movement to follow.  The cinematic imagery would lay the foundation for much of the ""new breed"" of sci-fi film and television to follow.  The, true fans found out there was another version....

The later cuts would demonstrate that even beyond the U.S. release, ""Blade Runner"" was a difficult movie to pidgeonhole, and that's what made the journey through each successive cut so damned exciting.  Even without  them, the original had riddles that demanded we solved them through the same painstaking detective worl Deckard used.  The acting was so top notch, we knew we had a new breed of heroes, lovers, villains, and chorus members worth getting to know and love.  The ultimate question of even Deckard's identity, so beautifully clawed out of Harrison Ford (proving that, if anything else, he CAN act and has the chops to play so charismatic and troubled a protagonist) is but one of a multitude of deep questions.

Everyone in this movie has something to be proud of, and even with only ""Blade Runner"" as a successful project on their resume, they were a part of something special.  A few truly deserve to have their later careers reexamined for something beyond what audiences and their fellow creative types saw as ""failures.""

The package itself is worthy of the complexity of the movie. Sure, there's the collector's goodies thrown in, which are fun for themselves.  What's finally done right for the movie is the sheer damn amount of video treasures included which demonstrates both to the longtime fan and those who want to get to know it why ""Blade Runner"" is worth all this time, attention, and, yeah, I'll admit it, obsessive love.

109612,5,0790729628,"Seldom does a movie come around that is as popular or more popular than it was decades ago.  Blade Runner was a Box Office flop when it originally debuted in 1982.  Although the film quickly gained a cultish following of hardcore fans that enjoyed it as an epic Sci-fi classic.  Now in 2007 the movie can once again be enjoyed by it's masses.  A newly remastered collection of five discs has made it's way to hi-def world.  So how does it look and play all these years later.  Extremely well.

I am probably one of the few to buy this movie who has actually only watched it once before.  I was a child when this movie first came out and it was hard to understand how good of a movie this is until now as an adult.  The story takes place in a futuristic world set in 2017.  From the first moment on you can realize the epic scale this movie was put on.  A corporation has created these cyber humans called replicants.  Nearly identical to real people they were created to do slave labor.  Although the replicants are very human like and that causes problems.  Thus brings in Blade Runners.  These bounty hunters go searching for rogue replicants.  The replicants have been banned from Earth which means the Blade Runner must find any that find there way here.

Harrison Ford plays one of the Blade Runner by the name of Rick Deckard.  Fresh from his first Indiana Jones movie he shows why he is a action/sci-fi star.  Four replicants free themselves from a planet and have come to Earth to search for their maker.  From the first moment on this movie begins to raise philosophical questions.  Right or wrong and should all replicants be retired(killed) for just being a replicant.  Especially when these replicants become so human like.  This becomes evident in the character played by Sean Young named Rachael.  So human like and yet created by science.

Most of the movie appears dark in many scenes, night seems to be when people live in this futuristic world.  Despite the darkness much of the color is illuminated in a light blue color which is fascinating to the eyes.  The music sets the tone thru the movie in which it can be rather pleasant to sometimes eery.

The Blu-ray version of this film is quite a feat.  The sheer beauty of it in high definition is the clear vision that Ridley Scott intended.  From the first scene to the last you can tell this movie went thru more than a once over.  The sound is excellent and really brings out the film.

Blade Runner is without a doubt another classic.  Although a sci-fi movie the story delves much deeper than that.  This is a movie that should be seen by everyone.  Any fan of sci-fi or just a good plot will love this movie.  Age has only made it better.  Without a doubt this is one collection that should be in any Blu-ray movie owners collection.",1199145600,,2807,4.476284584980237

The sound quality alone is worth the purchase, it will make your subwoofer work like no other film.  BTW, there is a great story, dark and detailed that stands up for multiple viewings.  Revel in a dark, steamy, crowded and multicultural version of the future with high tech and the medieval marketplace superimposed.  It looks just like parts of New York, LA or Hong Kong today.  It makes you wonder how Ridley got so close and another reason to look back to 1982 to see a vision from the future.  The documentaries show how there is still no agreement about the best version of the film and it's meaning.

I've marveled at the far-reaching influence of the graphical elements, costume, set design and tone have all been paid homage and incorporated into every day life as well as other art forms.  To finally understand Harrison Ford's reluctance to discuss the project was well worth the kit alone!  The extra goodies, the spinner and unicorn are fun, nicely designed additions to the set, as are the beautifully presented concept art panels.

109616,4,0790729628,"I've now watched the final cut. It cleans up the audio in several places, and the color is better overall; though there is something to be said for the orange-brown dystopic color of the older versions. This would be the definitive cut if it wasn't for one grating change, and that's where Roy says ""I want more life ... Father."" In the older versions he says ""I want more life ... F--ker."" Now the impact of the scene has been reduced considerably. Roy saying ""F--ker"" had a lot of impact and intensity because it's the only swear word in the movie, and it's uttered by a replicant.

Is Ridley Scott pulling a George Lucas here? He gets an A+ for all the other changes, but an F- for this one, for no F--ker. You can't make a change like this after 25 years has gone by.

As far as the rest: good.  I didn't get the 5-disc version because I saw no point in having a workprint version (which I hear is very similar to the Director's Cut anyway).  I'm a fan of the movie, not a fanatic that requires all the droppings off the cutting room floor. A part of me regrets this decision though.

Whoever put together the deleted and alternate scenes on the 4th disc did an excellent job of transitioning them.  It runs like a mini-Blade Runner movie.  One thing that annoys me about DVD releases is that they don't have an option to play all deleted scenes into the movie, or at least have the ability to play all scenes consecutively.

There's a lot of material on the 4th disc and most of it is worth watching.  The documentary is good, though it kind of put me to sleep in parts.",1199059200,2,1575,4.293918918918919

109623,5,0790729628,"This film has captivated me since I first watched it on VHS years ago. Since then I went to the theaters and saw it on the big screen when the director's cut was released. Ridley Scott is truly an amazing director in every sense. This film plays with your emotions, the imagery spellbinding, and the soundtrack transcends and compliments perfectly the cinematography. I think you either can appreciate this for an incredible work of art in many respects or it's lost on you. So be it.

I can understand how many people find the film confusing and the pacing rather stifling. It's a slow moving, rather heady movie. But I think what makes people think this way is that they're used to sci-fi being action-packed and not too much to think about. Both of these established trends in sci-fi movies run counter to Blade Runner.

On to the HD version. Well, I can tell you that this DVD set is what pushed me over into buying into the HD format wars. I think the HD format wars are incredibly stupid and I can't believe this sort of thing is allowed to go on in the world still. Decided and standard media and content formats makes total sense. And having two HD formats to confuse and split the HD market doesn't really help make HD mainstream. I really wish some consumer group would step in and say we only get one. Can you imagine if we had two CD formats to deal with? I know competition is good but when it comes to standard media and content formats, it often becomes a setback to me.  With all that being said, I now own a HD TV and really want to take advantage of it.

So I opted for the HD-DVD format since players still tend to be cheaper and the 10 DVD was too much for me to pass up. Plus I just went through a horrible year with Sony and their incredibly awful customer support that I've sworn off Sony products in our house. It's funny since from what I read HD-DVD usually offers more features than their Blue-Ray versions. Reminds me how Betamax was truly superior but that didn't matter in the long run, did it? Sure, one of these HD formats will become the Betamax of this decade but I didn't want to hold out any longer. I don't plan on buying too many DVDs but rather rent them from Netflix when I want to see a movie in HD.

Now on to the DVD set itself. The Final Cut is well done and the HD transfer is incredible. When the opening scene shows up on your HD set, it's really one of those ""Wow"" moments. The Final Cut definitely feels the tightest of the versions, clocking in just shy of 2 hours. But I think I miss some of the scenes I'm used to seeing in the Director's Cut. But that's okay since this collection has every version for your viewing pleasure. As another reviewer mentions, the Dangerous Days feature is enough to make this collection worthwhile. It's an amazing documentary for anyone the least bit interested in what went into making this landmark film.

So for any Blade Runner fan, this is an obvious must-have. If you've appreciated the film in the past, you'll fall in love with it all over again watching it in this collection. If you like Blade Runner but not a huge fan, I would suggest getting just the 2 disc version since it has The Final Cut and Dangerous Days. The two best parts of this collection that I can say so far. I haven't had a chance to dig into the fourth disc with all the extras and deleted scenes, but I'm guessing this is hard-core fan material anyways.",1198972800,,3418,4.341158059467919

In the past I have seen other sets claiming to have special bonus items included and usually they were cheaply made and carelessly thrown in. Bait to lure in unsuspecting collectors. The bonus items in this set went beyond my expectations and are great conversation pieces I would be proud to have on display.

109625,5,0790729628,"25 years after the theatrical release of Ridley Scott's science fiction masterpiece Blade Runner, the film still retains every bit of its visual brilliance (made even more gorgeous with digitally remastered picture), but it's crystal clear that more than just the imagery makes Scott's 3rd film one of the most important and entertaining films of its genre.

In futuristic Los Angeles, androids designed to be nearly indistinguishable from humans are banned from Earth after mutinous actions off-world. These Replicants that attempt to return are to be hunted down and ""retired"" by special police units known as Blade Runners. When one such enforcer, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is assigned to eliminate a group of extremely dangerous Nexus 6 Series Replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), he begins to acknowledge the thin line that defines humanity. In his eventual confrontation with Batty, and through encounters with an unknowing Replicant named Rachel (Sean Young), Deckard will learn what it means to be human.

The steady build of each main character is truly flawless and the deliberate pacing allows for more powerful revelations into the intricacies of humanity. Harrison Ford perfectly captures the initially remorseless Blade Runner Rick Deckard, who terminates Replicants for a living and appears indifferent towards their existence - that is until he encounters Rachel. Slowly falling for the beautiful creation, who doesn't even realize what she is, Deckard begins to question what it means to be human (and many believe Deckard to be a Replicant himself, generating even more philosophical questions).

Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty embodies the perfect antagonist to Deckard's antihero, a violent and ruthless killer who wants what he cannot have - an extension on life itself. A sporting terminator of sorts, Batty possesses many attributes that Deckard does not (and vice versa), and the two parallel and supplement the essence of each other's existence. Batty starts with a clear purpose and mission, yet ends meeting the inevitable fate so cruelly inherent to his kind. Deckard has a less focused existence and is forced into his unwanted assignment; he only begins to value life when he falls in love with Rachel and acquires a new purpose. He gains life and love as Batty loses both. Batty's poetic final words echo a loss of life, not the simple ""retiring"" of an android, and Gaff's portent closing admonition accords with Deckard's desire to cherish what time he has left with Rachel.

The set designs and look of the film is nothing short of cinematically inspired. Turbid steam flows freely from every mechanical object hovering, gliding and scampering about; murky water plummets from the sky, drips from ceilings and skates across the trash-ridden streets of a futuristic Los Angeles. Styled to look like Tokyo if it had succumb to gross overpopulation, pollution and a totalitarian government, the streets of 2019 L.A. are covered in highly stylized denizens not that far removed from the cantina of Mos Eisley. A feeling of dread, alienation and claustrophobia lingers about every blackened, sordid street, and the various smattering of languages creates a further isolation from the comforts of familiar humanity.

Enormous, uninviting skyscrapers tower above the dusky horizon, and blinking spaceships scurry around the bustling airways. Every bit of scenery is blanketed with smog, shadows and smoke, and shimmering neons and electric billboards peek through the dismal vapors. The atmosphere of Blade Runner is wholly unique, and it adds to the striking seriousness of every event, no matter how outlandish or (science) fictional, and gives it the distinct tone of uncertainty, dehumanization and fear surrounding mortality. Pulsing electronic rhythms by Vangelis permeate the grim events and narrate the moody film noir elements that frequent this seminal science fiction epic.

Some say 2001: A Space Odyssey is the finest example of science fiction ever to grace the big screen, but we say Blade Runner. With suspenseful action, perfect acting, unbeatable character development and designs, beautifully foreboding sets, poetic dialogue, poignant themes, gripping violence, flawless storytelling and a love story to boot, Ridley Scott's broodingly dark foray into serious science fiction is the uncontested champion.

109626,5,0790729628,"This five disc version is a nearly exhaustive treatment of this seminal work in movie history, one of my favorite movies, and one of those great movies that forever remind of the time that I first saw it.

Roy Batty was my favorite character in this movie.  Harrison Ford and Sean Young really did not have much chemistry in this movie, and Daryl Hannah was completely uglified by her fright wig and makeup.  Rutger Hauer, IMHO, carried this movie, and I have yet to see either Hauer or any other character or actor display in any other movie such a wide and complex array of charm, love, anger, malice, menace, machismo, sadness, sensitivity, and poetry as Roy Batty.  The various featurettes and commentaries make clear just how much Rutger Hauer's ideas contributed to the creation of this character.

I got this five disc version mainly to get the work print, which is the only thing different, DVD-wise, from the four disc version.  Oh, and you get the serially numbered ""Collector's Edition"" plastic briefcase, some prints of conceptual art for the film, a clear plastic display with four pseudo holographic photos of Decker - stuck together with magnets, a plastic unicorn, and a plastic model of a spinner car.

The best part of the work print DVD is the featurette about the restoration team that put together the Final Cut version, and their description of the various digital changes in the Final Cut.  There is also a richly detailed commentary track by author Paul Sammon explaining all the differences between the work print version and the other versions.

The work print version of the movie itself was disappointing.  The introduction by Ridley Scott admits to its rough edges, and the fact that it was based on the only remaining print left that they could find - it had deteriorated and needed to be restored.  The movie shakes slightly in the projector throughout the DVD.  The soundtrack does not have all of Vangelis's tracks, and the sound quality is horrible, despite the restoration.

The work print movie has a number of small snippets of additional footage and tiny bits of additional  monologue, some of which re-appear in the Final Cut, but from a film standpoint, the main difference from any of the other versions is Roy Batty's death scene which is totally different.  There is a wide angle shot of Batty sitting down as he dies on the rooftop and the spinner car rises up behind him, and Harrison Ford does a totally different, long, and pedantic voice-over (this was the voice-over part that Ridley Scott had agreed to do).  Vangelis's poignant soundtrack is filled in by some ""temp"" music (Ridley Scott's words) which sounds like dental office music.  It's an unrefined and impotent version of what would later become the most powerful scene and signature moment of this movie.

As for the rest of this DVD collection, the extensive featurettes on the history of this movie are fascinating.  Hearing the original participants talk about it does clear up some myths.  For one thing, there was an even longer version of this movie which has never been seen by more than a select few people  - the very first cut was 4 hours long!

Many of the outtakes from this longer version are in Disc 4, including a brief nude scene from Sean Young.  These outtakes are cleverly strung together in what amounts to an alternate universe version of Blade Runner - the Blade Runner movie left on the cutting room floor. But there are only hints of still other missing scenes - for example, a brief flash of a longer love scene in bed appears in one of the ""Making of"" featurettes.

After all the controversy about the voiceover, it turns out that the voiceover had originally been written into the script by Hampton Fancher.  The first versions of the voiceover were done willingly by both Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott after test screenings of the work print on the public showed that many viewers were completely confused by the movie.  It was only in the final version of the voiceover that Ridley Scott was removed from the film and Harrison Ford was forced to do it in his absence.  Similarly, the ""happy ending"" was filmed willingly by Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford because of negative audience reactions elicited during the initial test screenings.

I had seen the Final Cut at the Laemmle theater in Los Angeles, and was surprised to find, after all these years, and all the controversy over the lack of a voiceover, that I did not miss the voice-over except perhaps at the scene of Roy Batty's death.  The Final Cut contains a few small snippets of extra scenes that can be found in the work print as well as some digitally replaced improvements that are fairly subtle and well done.  The DVD version is crisp but quite dark, although you can adjust for that with your screen or DVD playing software.

As for the two different endings, the two interpretations of whether Decker is a replicant or a human, well, I like both versions equally.

And so this great 5-disc set makes clear that there really is no definitive version of Blade Runner.  There is instead only the Blade Runner Multiverse.",1198886400,6,5123,4.752542372881356

109628,5,0790729628,"I have to disagree with all of the other reviews that the theatrical version is superior. While I am glad that all versions are included in this 4-disc set, The Final Cut is the best version of the movie, by far, and is further enhanced by the gorgeous print and outstanding audio brought together for this latest release of the film.

Harrison Ford himself has stated that they did 6 takes of the narration which just never worked, and I wholeheartedly agree. While in theory it seemed to fit with the film noir aspect of the film, it was poorly done and detracted rather than added to it. The narration, along with the extremely cheesy ""happy ending"", were mandated by the studio and almost dumb down the film and remove some of its character in a way that doesn't happen with the Director's Cut and this latest Final Cut version.

The continuity fixes, the audio and visual fixes and the bonus extras make this an extremely worthwhile addition to your DVD collection, regardless of whether you already own any previous format or version of Blade Runner.",1198886400,4,1056,4.672043010752688

It looks to me as if the ""money men"" still have their say as to what the public is willing to digest when it comes to studio releases. Either that or Ridley has lost his vision after so many years.
What I am referencing here is what was undoubtedly left on the cutting room floor. It's a fact that Ridley battled the bean counters many times during the course of production. So where in this ""definitive set"" are the scenes which were scrapped?? They're still on the cutting room floor (as far as I can tell).
Camerons ""The Abyss"" added nearly 40 minutes in it's directors cut and made a huge difference.
Even ""Aliens"" had quite a few minutes added which made that version much more plausible.
Lynchs' ""Dune"" left hours on the cutting room floor which might have made that story what it should have been.
I guess the bean counters decided our attention spans were just too short to do this film the justice it deserved, and Ridley went along with the ride.",1198886400,,1125,4.466019417475728

This is the ""it"" you've been waiting for. Every relevant version of the film is included here.

The extras, the making of, the production stuff, is all quite interesting, if even a bit boring to some. But if you're a movie buff and like to know how stuff gets done behind the scenes, you won't be disappointed here at all.

A few years ago Warner released this movie in a Directors cut with a horrible transfer and no special features of which to speak of. And the Directors Cut was not to the liking of the Director...Ironic isn't it? So Warner gave Ridley Scott the go ahead to make his definitive edition. This product exemplifies the hard work and dedication that every single person in the cast and crew gave. This product is the be all end all for Blade Runner. The transfer is awesome with crisp clear colors and very defined blacks. The Audio is just as amazing with its 5.1 surround sound. All of the special features are very interesting with amazing insight as to how the movie was made. Included in this box-set are all of the different versions of the film, including the extremely rare work print version. All of this is in a very nice plastic case that resembles Deckards Voight-Kampff case. Included in the case is a Unicorn Oragami Figurine and spinner car model. Also included is a lenticular motion still and a mock case file with various pictures of Pre-production art by Syd Mead and other artists.

The Final Cut transfer is gorgeous.  And I'm not normally the kind of person who notices such things.

109634,4,0790729628,"My rating is based on the overall product and not just the film.  I have received the actual product and it is not the brushed metal finish as has been widely marketed.  It is unfortunate because the flat plastic gray of the actual product looks cheap considering the production of this set.  Ultimately it does not matter at this time since the only way to obtain the 5-disc set is in this form.  Perhaps in the future the 5-disc set will be offered separately.  The price of the set reflects the overall quality.  You get alot of stuff, but it feels cheap.  For Blade Runner fans who are starving for collectibles, this is a great set.  If this set is the only way to get the 5 discs then I wouldn't mind paying more and getting higher quality collectibles.  For example, the unicorn model included could have been sculpted to look more like the one pictured in the film and the spinner has a cheap feel, though it looks pretty much like the one featured in the film.  I enjoyed the lenticular animated scene and the production sketches, but I would have much rather had a photo collection consisting of those from Leon's drawer, of Rachael and her mother, maybe some from Deckard's piano, and especially the Polaroid-like print-out of Zhora.  The photos were, to me, the main ephemeral icons of the movie.

Overall it is a fun set to have, but i would have paid a little more for a ""Collector's Edition"" with higher quality extras(aside from the dvd content).",1198886400,2,1462,4.559386973180077

I've just watched the 'Dangerous Days' documentary and it's a delight. I couldn't ask for more. This is exceptionally good value for money and beyond my wildest expectations in terms of content and quality.

109636,5,0790729628,"I've always thought that the narrative was weak. Right from the start with the cornball dialogue between the police captain and Harrison Ford.

But that's not why I've seen this movie a dozen times. I keep watching Blade Runner over and over again for the way Ridley Scott, along with others, constructed such a believable vision of a future LA, filled with people, lights, junk, and noise.

For that, this is the best version of the movie I've seen. The re-mastered blu-ray looks amazing. Every scene has so much more detail. The scene in which Sean Young shows up at Harrison Ford's apartment, you can see the RCA sign blinking red out of the window behind her. And the smoke! There's smoke everywhere in this movie. Where in previous releases it obscures everything else in the frame, in this version you can see the smoke wafting around and above everything else on the screen.

So, if you're not a fan of Blade Runner, you're still not going to like it. But if you are, you have to get one of the HD versions of this movie. And like other reviewers have mentioned, I'm just bummed that the other versions, especially the workprint, weren't also remastered in HD (but that's a quibble).",1198886400,,1190,4.630331753554502

The definitive version of the film, a comprehensive documentary, and all the other versions of the film for comparison (except the workprint, which quite frankly, your average non-obsessed fan will not care much about). Plus deleted and alternate scenes, featurettes on Phillip K. Dick, trailers, and lots of other goodies to keep you entertained for hours.

Just as an aside: I saw the theatrical version with narration for the first time with this set. I alternated between grimacing and laughing at Ford's narration. And the ending was atrocious considering what had gone before. Maybe it's because the Director's Cut was the way I first saw the film, but this version didn't work for me at all.

Nope, I think the Final Cut is the best yet. Cleaned up, ""fixed"" digitally, and just the right tone. But if you're a fan of the original, it's here, too.

The main problem with this is uness you have small child like hands and fingers you will never carry this by the handle, the handle is just to small (although I don't know where you will be taking it much).  The plastic cover that comes over the cast it self was kinda bent at the corners due to the shrink wrap that was over that.  I just don't like it when there is a plastic sleeve over cases, they just get messed up some how.

Whats inside the box is cool, the art work is great and the hologram thingie as well.  But the unicorn and car are cheep looking, the unicorn is plastic that was been chromed up and you can tell the edge is still there from when it was molded not really smoothed out.  The car has doors that open which is cool but only the back wheels move, and I can see visible glue on the windows on the bottom of the car.  There is a clear plastic insert with a message from Ridley Scott which is nice to see

That being said the quality of the Movie itself was above par for most all HD DVD's out that were transfered from film that was oldish

For the most part the price is great for what you get (there is also just the 5 discs for something like $30 USD or something like that) but I would have paid 2 times this for a metal case with a handle you can use and a die cast unicorn and car

but for the fans out there this is a must buy weather this one or the 5 disc stand alone one, but apparently there are only 103000 of these made since there is a sticker on the bottom of mine (that is not on straight as well) that says ""Limited Edition 076209/103000"" so I guess thats how many there are.

109645,5,0790729628,"""Blade Runner"" immediately stood out as a movie with incredible depth -- you BELIEVED in the world Ridley Scott created, it made sense, and it all fit together.  The 2nd disc of this set contains a long documentary (actually several of them) which show how this world was constructed, what went into it, who contributed what and how it all came together to create something that was somehow more than the sum of its parts.

This ""making of"" disc is far-and-away the best such documentary I've ever seen.  It has, of course, contemporary interviews from almost everybody involved with the production (actors, director, production designers, visual effects artists, gaffers on down to the financiers) but also scads and scads of footage to illustrate the points being made -- and almost ALL of this footage never made it to the movie!  It's like a whole 2nd Blade Runner movie, looking at the Blade Runner universe from new angles inside the Blade Runner universe.  Sheer bliss for the fan.

Among the interviewees is Paul Sammon, who wrote the great, great book on the ""making of.""  Nice to see attention paid to someone who, while not a part of the production crew per se, was very much a part of the machinery which advanced the legend of ""Blade Runner.""

All these years later -- my goodness, 25 now? -- the pain of making the movie, under very difficult conditions with a very demanding director and incredible forces vying with each other for control, all these years later everybody involved has learned to be gracious.  Even Sean Young and Harrison Ford speak affectionately of each other.  It must be true that in the end the work stands on its own, and those who had a hand in it can finally see that what they created is, indeed, more than the sum of its parts.",1198800000,5,1770,4.680645161290323
109646,4,0790729628,"The reputation of this film seems to precede the actual film itself. With that said, I bought this film having never really watched it before. I bought it based upon its critical acclaim and the talent involved. So after viewing this film for the very first time, I can't say I was absolutely blown away by it, but I will say that's a pretty good film. I enjoyed the basic plot of the film: The year is 2019, and a 21st Detective (Harrison Ford) is ordered to kill a small group of fugitive ""replicants"", or androids, that have come to Los Angeles. Of course, there is other sub-plots to the story, as well as a deeper meaning overall, but since this is such a popular movie, I wouldn't expect that there aren't as many under-privileged people out there as myself who would be reading or commenting about this film without knowing much about the story first! Anyway, I did enjoy the story to the film. Of course, the acting is good. With Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer, especially, putting on great performances. The sequences between these two during the last 20 minutes or so the film are wonderful. But what I loved most about the film was the setting and atmosphere. There are some really elaborate sets in this film. The lighting, and lack of lighting at times, really sets the mood and tempo of the film. And the gritty feel of the streets of futuristic Los Angeles is done really well. However, there were a few little things that I was expecting to be better with this film. From reading the back of the DVD, it made is sound this film was packed with action, when in fact, there just isn't many true action sequences in the film. There's one chase scene and of course the climatic ending, but that's about it as far as any lengthy action scenes. With that said, I feel there are certain slow spots in the film where it kinda dragged a bit. But other than that, this film is good. Its definitely worth purchasing at this price. Especially when this DVD comes with 3 different commentaries and a 3 and a half hour ""Making Of"" documentary. No, this isn't as in depth as the 5-disc collection. but if you're not a hardcore fan of the film, and just want a more affordable packaging to the film, this one is for you.",1198713600,2,2220,4.443627450980392
109647,5,0790729628,"Just finished watching the final cut of the film and want to give this set my highest recommendation. I opted for this 4-disc version because of price and because it had everything the 5-disc version has except the rough version and the toys, which are both nice, but I can live without.

The first thing that jumps out is how stunningly clear the picture is! I don't have blu-ray of HD, just standard DVD and the picture on the final cut really was cleaned up frame by frame. No scratches, no dirt. I won't say bright color because it's not that kind of movie, but clearly defined color and a sharp image. For the night scenes and interiors, the sharpness really helps as you can clearly see what's going on and the neon highlights frame every outside shot. When Zhora goes through the window, the neon framing is spellbinding. And, yes, they did fix the shot. It looks great if you haven't seen the movie, but if you're familiar with the scene your brain gets into a tug of war because the new insertion looks real but you've got the mental image in your mind of the stunt woman with the bad wig. Messes with your head a little. Also they claim they did the same restoration on ALL the versions available but I watched the 1982 US Theatrical version first and, although it looked great, it looked nowhere near as good as the Final Cut version.

One of the things I noticed for the first time on this super clean version is the jerk of a camera cut I never noticed before. I really wish they could have fixed this because it jars the viewer out of the scene. When Deckard pulls his gun on Leon and gets it slapped out of his hand, the image jerks for a fraction of a second. I had to go frame by frame to solve this little mystery and found the cut: When Deckard pulls the gun, his tie comes up with it. When Leon slaps it out of his hand, his tie is down. As the tie, in the up position is right in the middle of the frame and can be clearly viewed now, when it snaps down it affects the scene. They clearly combined two takes of the scene and did it very well -- just not seamlessly. I mean they got rid of the spinner cables, fixed Zhora, but left this little camera jerk during a great scene. It sounds minor, I know, but when you watch the movie, it'll get you. I don't know if this has been something Blade Runner fans have been talking about for years or not, but it was the first time I noticed it.

The narration is gone. This was my first time watching it without the narration and it played fine. I DO like the narration as well because I'm a sucker for old film noir and love the elements from The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep and countless other classics that are woven into the film. I didn't think I'd like the movie without the narration but I did though I'm also glad to have both versions on the set. And Scott went with ""I want more life... father."" Which I think works better but they were not able to synch Hauer's mouth to the word.

The sound is also incredible! And that's, again, on a standard TV. No home theater of surround sound. If you've got these things, the movie will rock!

What's added only enhances the movie. There are no big additions. Just fixing of effects, changing Zhora, giving the bird something a whole lot better to fly up to at the end. All of the effect additions are subtle. They make everything look real, which is the whole point, right?

If you're thinking of picking up one of the several hundred version that just came out, I think you'll come away with a new appreciation for the film. The clarity of image and sound reveal things you've never seen before no matter how many times you've seen the movie. They did a stellar job on the restoration. Plus the 3 and a half hour making of, 45 minutes of deleted scenes never shown in ANY version of the film, and featurettes on just about anything you can imagine related to the film. And you find out, once and for all, how Scott wanted us to view Deckard -- human or replicant.

If you've been waiting to see Blade Runner done right, the wait is over. It's not perfect (see above), but it's the best it's ever been. This is a great set, well worth the price!",1198713600,8,4180,4.2768647281921615
109648,5,0790729628,"The longest awaited DVD special edition of Ridley Scott's Masterpiece (Alien is a close 2nd) is here at last and - It was worth the long wait!

This is a benchmark for DVD in the same way the 1999 release of Alien, and the 2000 releases of Fight Club and The Matrix pushed the boundries of when the format was new.

The special edition has been done to death and it takes a lot to impress DVD fanatics these days but this set does the trick and then some.

The HD version boasts not 1 but 5 different cuts of BL all in anamorphic widescreen and remastered in 1080P (are you listening Mr. Lucas?  This is how you treat loyal fans - not by slapping them in the face with your revisionist antics).

The commentaries are great, Dangerous Days is one of the best movie documentaries ever made, and all the little details are what make this set so great.

Note:  If you hit Play All on the deleted scenes - they play out like an Alternate short version of BL which I like to call the ""Super 8"" cut.  For those of you too young to remember...before VHS, companies used to sell 8MM film clip reels of films like Star Wars, Superman etc and you'd play these selected scenes on a projector.",1198713600,,1180,4.260089686098655
109649,5,0790729628,"This is a review of the Final Cut, not the movie itself, which everyone knows is great.

I am very glad that the producers did their job to restore, clean and enhance the video and sound quality, only for this, this DVD is a must to longtime Blade Runner fans, it does not matter at all if you own the previous DVD of the Director's Cut because at once the Final Cut begins you know you spent your money right. It's almost like the film was done last year in digital, it's amazing! The contrast between bright and dark is greater, and the picture quality and resolution is far better than in the original Director's Cut VHS and DVD. Moreover, the soundtrack sounds better than my Blade Runner original CD, it has great depth and you can listen clearer the twiks, beeps and sounds of the future. So, if you are hesitanting because you already own the Director's Cut DVD, my recomendation is: get the Final Cut now!

About the other differences between the Director's and Final Cut: they are essentially the same film, Riddley Scott simply perfected the Director's Cut (which was rushed in 1992 because the Workprint version leaked as Scott's 'true' vision): Some minor CGI adjustments in the fantastic 2019 LA cityscape; Zhora's death scene is improved, now you can really tell is Zhora who is shot, not just some stunt woman; the unicorn sequence is slightly longer and trippier; Tyrell's death is blodier (and in general the movie is more violent, just like the International version); some additional shots of LA streets and dialogue; finally, the only CGI 'major' addition is the dove flying at the end towards the 2019 LA polluted skies.

In a nutshell, this is Blade Runner as it should be, and how it was meant to be: perfect image quality and excellent sound quality. I really do not care now for the theatrical version (yes, I saw it first of all versions, many years ago and I did like it) with that unnecesary voiceover that ruins the music soundtrack in some parts - an essential aspect of the film, you see, I love the music; I saw the workprint a while ago and it is just an unfinished version, nothing less, nothing more. So if you are budget minded, can live without the other versions and some featurettes and simply love this movie, go for this Final Cut (and also there's an excellent 3 plus hour documental and three audio commentaries from Scott's and company that should more than satisfy your Blade Runner hunger!).",1198713600,10,2437,4.636574074074074
109650,5,0790729628,"This will be short and sweet. This is a truly GREAT motion picture, Sci-Fi or otherwise. The Final Cut is very satisfying. We all know the various versions of the film--they're all there. Pick your favorite. The Final Cut is now mine. You must have this film if you consider yourself a film buff, a lover of sci-fi, or just a lover of finely wrought, well-written, superbly acted, gloriously photographed films.

The HD-DVD transfer is incredible both visually and aurally; the difference in clarity, depth, texture, and immersion from the non-HD versions is remarkable. This film has become almost a tactile experience. Just buy it.

Now, the box. I opened my box, and what do I find inside the shrink-wrapped DVD case? A notice from Warner Brothers that my BLU-RAY player may have been manufactured so long ago it may need an upgrade to play this disc! All the discs, THANK GOD!, are HD-DVD and play perfectly. I would never buy Blu-Ray. Who packed this box? Some sad and increasingly discouraged Blu-Ray mole? After I checked my discs thoroughly, I laughed. This format war is nuts.

This HD-DVD version is terrific. You will not be unhappy (unless you haven't bought an HD-DVD player!). Amazon has them on special promotion.",1198713600,4,1228,4.866028708133971

109653,5,0790729628,"Having seen this movie probably more time and in more different formats than most people, I thought it was time I write a few words about this masterpiece of filmmaking. Truly, I wasn't boasting with my assertion that I've seen this movie as much as I have (I watch this movie almost once a week and have done so for almost 10 years). I own several, still unopened, VHS tapes that for a large part of the nineties I did my best at collecting. I own the Japanese Laserdisc version, a rare bootleg version that was distributed over the internet a handful of years ago that has the narration selectively placed back into the Director's Cut version of the film, not called the Esper Version as some would want to label it, the Director's Cut and now the HD version of the Final Cut. That makes 5, but 6 if you count the Workprint version that comes with this box set. So, I would say that's one more than most.

Blade Runner first and foremost, is probably the greatest film ever made, from beginning to end and in all of its variations. A bold statement when the film doesn't even rank in the top 10 in the American Film Institute or on IMDb. Spots #97 and #104 respectively (ahem). But as these kind of lists are subjective and truly under the control of mere mortals and their own strange whims, and I take no offense that so many so-called aficionados have over-looked this film for so long. Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that `Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film.

For years, Blade Runner was divided into two different camps, or rather four and they are: Those that preferred the narration and those that did not and the other camp was those that thought Deckard was a Replicant and those that thought he was either human or felt it was left ambiguous. Ridley Scott has very gracefully over the years, given homage to these thoughts and made many statements that most readers are aware of, chiefly - that Deckard was a Replicant. Unfortunately, due to the studios fingering with the film during post-production, Warner Brothers had the right to trim anything after the 120 min mark, and thus butchering the nuance of the film and leaving several things vague and forcing Scott to tack on the Happy ending and the narration - because as we all know ... we're all just too stupid to get it.

The new and most refreshing part of the new argument, evinced in the 210 (wow!) min documentary `Dangerous Days' is that Scott gives equal time to those that enjoyed the film with the narration, with Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) in the forefront, with his very candid telling of how Blade Runner changed his life and launched him down the road into filmmaking. We also get to hear a very lucid and warm retelling from Harrison Ford of the nightmare that he not only endured making the movie but the further commitment of having to do the Voice Over narration months later, which ended up having its own strange story as well.

So, now with 5 versions available in this box set, you get to see Blade Runner in every single angle imaginable and it is engrossing every time. Ebert also said in the Nineties that the re-release of the movie for the Director's Cut gives you yet another version of the film, but fails to handle the main problems that were so apparent the first time around. As the film has changed Ebert has gone from student flippancy to utmost respect and enjoyment. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time if you're interested.

There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Blade Runner is probably the high water mark of all films and will probably stay that way for quite some time. Internet voting puts the film as the 4th greatest movie of all time, according to AFI's own user polls - so that really puts perspective on AFI's and IMDb's so-called Final Lists.

On a final note, when people watch this film, a lot of people come away with a strange feeling of familiarity regarding the content, the story and the character of Rick Deckard the protagonist, the Detective, the Blade Runner. You should know that Philip K. Dick was an incredibly huge fan of Raymond Chandler and absorbed every one of his stories on a personal level. Hampton Fancher, the screenwriter was privy to this when he penned the screenplay while making the adaptation for `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and did his best to not only pay homage to this for Dick but for Chandler as well. Movies like `The Big Sleep' really bring it home and make it evident to the viewer. The novel almost reads like the narration and in latter years I find impossible to not hear Harrison Ford's voice as I read `The Big Sleep'.

109654,5,0790729628,"A few years ago, George Lucas appealed to fans by reluctantly releasing the original theatrical versions of his Star Wars films.  Needless to say, they were released as bonus features to the special editions without upgraded audio and a non anamorphic transfer.  This wasn't really a set for the fans; rather, it was a cash in.

So it was a pleasant surprise to see Ridley Scott introduce the old theatrical version of Blade Runner stating that it was cleaned up and remastered so the viewer could watch Blade Runner whichever way he or she preferred.  It's a pit of the fan touch that makes this collection so wonderful.

There are a load of special features in this collection that make it worthwhile.  Most notably is the direct involvement of those originally behind the film - especially Ridley Scott who provides commentary on the final cut and is present throughout the Dangerous Days documentary.

The Dangerous Days documentary has to be one of the most thorough accounts of any one film, tracking the film's origins through its present cult status.  There is one feature that highlights one of the film's age old questions: is Deckard a replicant.  Amusingly, Frank Darabont, director of Shawshank Redemption, is interviewed, making a case against him being a replicant.

Then there are a slew of deleted scenes and promotional materials.  There's even a featurette about the posters.  How detailed can you get?  Probably the jewel in this set for fans is the work print version.  It's a curiosity piece, and while its inclusion is mandatory, it'll probably only get a couple spins on my dvd player.  The final cut is so beautiful, you really don't need any other version except maybe for nostalgia.

The final extra is the package itself, a plastic briefcase, featuring a plastic shiny origami unicorn (great at parties for making your friends think THEY'RE replicants) and a replica of the car driven in the film.  There are also a nifty lenticular picture encased in glass featuring Harrison Ford and some cards detailing some of the production art.

As for the film itself, after 25 years, Blade Runner doesn't show its age, celebrating a time when special effects were a true art form.  There is no CGI here.  Instead  Ridley Scott provides a visually arresting film depicting a dark, souless future.  You can spend hours detailing the metaphors found in the film as Deckard searches for replicants in a very dehumanized world, ultimately questioning his own humanity.  There are characters who have such depth that they are some of the most memorable scifi characters ever.  The somewhat manic Roy Batty, violent, poetic, and tragic, is still amazing to watch and listen to as he is so beautifully portrayed by Rutger Hauer.  The quest for humanity by all the characters is a universal theme that has inspired films both in and out of the realm of science fiction films for years and has made this film a classic.  If you are a real fan - you need to pick up this package - it's indespensible.",1198627200,9,3009,4.839530332681018
109655,4,0790729628,"Well the movie is great, but you already know that. It's a 5 star in any format! I do have some questions on my Ultimate Collectors Edition? Did I get some sort of bootleg? ""In addition, each briefcase will be individually numbered and in limited supply."" I have look over my package with a magnifying glass and can't find any 'number'! I would only downgrade this package, because of the packaging. Just buy the 5-disc version!",1198627200,,428,4.644736842105263
109656,4,0790729628,"""Blade Runner"" looks terrific and it's great to finally have all four versions of the film in one place. My only complaint is that it would have been better to include the work print version (the fifth and rarest version of the film) instead of the Director's Cut (which had its own release a couple of months back). Since the ""Director's Cut"" is on a seamlessly branching disc, it's not all that big a deal but WHY should you have to get it again? It would have made better sense to include the ""Work Print"" version for fans. It's a minor quibble but I've dinged the set a star for not being complete (The movie certainly deserves 5 stars and the set is really good--just not perfect which is what that 5 star rating is all about folks).

 If you can live without the ""Work Print"" version of the film, however, this may be the set for you since it is 1) less expensive than the deluxe ""Ultimate Edition"" with the briefcase and toys and 2)includes both the documentary AND all three previous versions of the movie on one disc.

Regardless, this is a very good set for the money and clearly the ""Work Print"" wasn't included to get folks to buy the ""Ultimate Edition"".

This edition includes:

1)The newly edited ""Final Cut"" which eliminates the narration, makes some minor trims to the film, puts Joanna Cassidy in the sequence where Zora is shot and killed (the stunt woman didn't look anything like her and wore a bad wig), fixes some continuity errors that happened when the sequence where Deckard fights Leon was pushed AFTER Zora was killed, erase the cables holding the Spinners, eliminate various crew members that accidently appeared on shots and finally adding in the original unicorn sequence shot for the film.

2)""Dangerous Days"" a three hour documentary on the trials and tribulations of making the film from conception to completion and the enduring popularity of the film.

3)All three previous versions on a seamless branched DVD. This includes the original theatrical cut, international cut which is about two minutes longer with more explicit scenes of violence and the ""Director's Cut"" which eliminated the voiceover narrative and the ""happy ending"".

4) The ""Enhancement Archive"" which includes short documentaries on author Philip K. Dick, his legacy as a writer, the novel vs. the film and a discussion of whether Deckard was a replicant featuring interviews with Ridley Scott (he says that anyone who thinks otherwise is a ""moron""), writer/director Frank Darabont (""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Green Mile"")who argues the opposite and Guillermo Del Toro (""Hell Boy"") who speaks affectionately about why he prefers the narration in the original film. There are additional supplements as well that cover a wide variety of subjects including one entitled ""The Nexus Generation"" (very clever ""Star Trek"" derived pun)which includes writers and directors discussing the impact of Scott's film.

This is a terrific version of the film marred only by the exclusion of the ""Work Print"" version of the film.",1198627200,2,3022,4.944773175542406
109657,5,0790729628,"Wow. You could call this overkill or OCD in action but Warner has assembled the ultimate edition of ""Blade Runner"" for its anniversary. Many others have noted what's included here so I'll comment on them briefly and then address image quality, etc.

Here's the run down:

1)""The Final Cut"" is on disc one of the set. This edition which has many tweaks including the cleaning up of continuity errors that Scott would have fixed if he had the time back in the 90's and 80's  (and the money to do so). This includes digitally removed the cable that hoists the Spinners, removing a bruise from Harrison Ford's face when the fight with Leon was placed AFTER Zora's killing (dramatically it made sense to put it after but it was originally before Zora's killing), replacing the stunt woman's face with Joanna Cassidy's so it looks good (Cassidy would have done the stunt if she had been asked but this is the next best thing since, again, if fixes a major glaring error), the ORIGINAL Unicorn scene shot for the movie but left out of the final version restored to the film and various other minor tweaks, a brief clip of the infamous scene of the dancing girls wearing the hockey masks.
2))""Dangerous Days"" (the title of the original screenplay)a full length 3 hour documentary on the trials and tribulations that Scott, Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast and crew went through to make ""Blade Runner"". This documentary is very fair balanced and covers the very conception of the film when Hampton Fancher optioned Dick's novel, interested producer Michael Deeley to Scott's involvement. It does skirt over the involvement and interest of other directors (and there were a few). Scott initially passed on the project and was set to direct Dino DeLaurentiis production of ""Dune"" until his older brother died. After that, he decided he didn't want to spent all the pre-production time on ""Dune"" and re-evaluated his priorities jumping on the project but also demanding rewrites from Fancher and eventually bringing in writer David Peoples (""Unforgiven"", ""Soldier""--which interestingly enough is what Peoples calls ""an indirect"" sequel to ""Blade Runner"" set in the same universe). Writer Paul Sammon (who provides a commentary track for ""Blade Runner"")wrote an excellent book that covers much of the same ground and appears discussing various aspects of production--this is essentially that book in documentary form.

3)The original theatrical release from 1982 unaltered. The ""International Release"" again unaltered. The ""Director's Cut"" released in the 90's and the only version available on DVD until now in the United States.
All three of these are on a single seamlessly branching disc where you select which version you want to watch. That's good news for those who love the original theatrical release with the narration, those that grew used to watching the international version which is exactly the same except for two minutes of extended violence. It was this version that showed up on home video. The ""Director's Cut"" shares more in common than differences between the other two with the narration missing and the happy ending as well as some minor trims here and there.

4)Disc four has the ""Enhancement Archives"" which includes documentaries on writer Philip K. Dick, his legacy and a comparison between the novel and film highlighting how Scott and his collaborators created a work that compliments the film finding film equivelents to Dick's vision.

5)The famous ""Workprint"" version that differs signficantly in some areas including a different opening title sequence and other minor differences. Although this isn't the ""Director's Cut"" version, its showing at a film festival is what prompted Scott and Warner to go back and create the ""Director's Cut"". This edition looks the worst of the five versions of the film presented here simply because the source material always looked much grainier and never looked as pristine as the final cut. The opening titles on this edition are completely different and there are other differences as well that fans will pick up.

Various toys including a Spinner and a Unicorn along with other cool collectable are in a nice little box that resembles the brief case that Deckard carries around the Voight-Kaumpf machine in. Fans of the film will probably want this edition but those who just want the movies may want to pick up the Blu-ray, HD-DVD five disc editions or, if you're willing to NOT have the workprint version, the four disc edition on DVD.

Image quality is stellar. The film has never looked this good in any of its incarnations. Personally, I would go for the high definition Blu-ray but the HD-DVD edition looks equally good. I've never seen ""Blade Runner"" looking this crisp.

This is the ultimate set for fans but be aware you can purchase the five disc edition without purchasing the ""Ultimate"" edition.",1198627200,5,4872,5.0272614622057
109658,5,0790729628,"The picture on the HD-DVD is just breathtaking.  The audio is fantastic as well.  This movie doesn't look like something that was filmed 25 years ago.  If it wasn't for the fact that Harrison Ford looks so much  younger, you would think that this was a newer movie.

Obviously, it is a great film with dark sci-fi themes that was way ahead of its time.  But seeing how mind-blowing the special effects look in HD just makes this a totally new film.

I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  In fact if you don't have one of the HD formats (I have both) you should upgrade simply to enjoy this film as it should be enjoyed.",1198627200,2,626,4.336206896551724

109663,5,0790729628,"...and that's a feature on the life and works of Vangelis. Being a fan of his music, I regard him as one-third of the central triumvirate of what drives this film (the other two being Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford). Aside from that, I can't complain about this latest incarnation of the movie. I'm not that much of a fan of sci-fi as I regard it as extremely far fetched and obtuse. As was mentioned in one of the feature DVD's in this set, science fiction was often cloaked in a cheerful, glossy setting where technology would see man through his problems. Blade Runner, on the other hand, practically indicts technology as fomenting them. There had been some like-plotted movies prior to Blade Runner's release (i.e., Soylent Green, Silent Running, etc). However, I, like the general audience of the day, was seeing science fiction through that cheerful prism, which explains its initial failure at the box office and subsequent popularity after we digested it. Take the opening titles: no grand crescendo orchestrated by John Williams against a galactic background, but the ominous drum-of-doom beat against a blacker-than-black background. In stark contrast to the background, is the date of November, 2019. When you see something like that as a teenager, you think, ""Oh my God, this is what the world is going to be like when I'm in my fifties"". Granted, the time span between 1982 and 2019 is too short for the technological innovations and the additional skyscrapers that we see in the film. I doubt we'll see these things until at least 2150. However, such chronological proximity only adds to the movie's shock value and goads the audience into thinking. The only indication that it takes place in Los Angeles is in the front credits. It's not its sun-drenched self, but a dark, rainy, mega city that's as cheerful as Detroit in winter and as garishly, phony as Las Vegas. There are no light speed transports, no cute or ugly alien life forms, no heroes, no villains, but rather a high tech extension of our industrialized society and dehumanized pop culture.",1198540800,7,2069,4.880681818181818

109666,5,0790729628,"Firstly the film is great and having the choice to see all 5 versions is a treat.  I like them all a lot BUT prefer the 1982 theatrical with the noirish narration.  It adds a shade of humanity to the film which makes it even more powerful.  It's a great film.

BUT LETS GET DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY.  Deckard is human despite what Scott has to say and any name calling he childishly wants to use.  Let me run through some reasons why:

The original source--Dick's novel--plays with the ambiguity of human/android and with Deckard BUT still CLEARLY Deckard is human not an android in there.  Hence a theme in the novel dehumanization of man and how close they were to the machines.  This theme would be senseless if Deckard was an android--and in the novel Deckard was human...it's just a fact.  The screenwriter is on record as saying Deckard was written as human in his script.  Harrison Ford is on record as playing Deckard as human.  Rutger Hauer in his bio says he and the other actors played it as was clearly understood on the set--that Deckard was human.  Hauer goes on to explain Scott's LATER claim of Deckard being an android by saying that's just like Scott--that he likes to mind ""F"" with people.

Okay now in the film--Deckard supposedly an android to retire other androids is a wimp.  He is physically weaker by far than the androids he hunts--including the pleasure unit Pris where needs a gun to even it up.  And with the male androids the disparity is even more ridiculous.  They throw him around like a rag doll, they bust through walls, barely feel pain through great physical distress and can jump great distances between high rise buildings easily.  None of this Deckard can do and he's not even close--all this supposedly from an android made to hunt.  Give me a break.  Batty's last speech to Deckard speaks to him as a human who doesn't understand them...you can say Batty didn't know but clearly to him Deckard was a weak human--it's so clear.  Yes Scott does make it ambiguous which is what the novel does but the great preponderance of evidence on and off the screen shows Deckard is human despite the ambiguity.  Yes Scott may have had it in his mind Deckard may be an android but it's clear as it was filmed in 1982 he was NOT.  Even the later added unicorn scene is NOT definitive--just another ambiguous sign.  It could have been a dream he had before and talked about, perhaps to fellow police or a police pyschologist(he certainly had enough problems to need to go to one!).  And it could therefore be in his file and Olmos at the end could just be messing with him.  THE POINT IS--THE UNICORN SCENE IS NOT DEFINITIVE.  Just another sign of ambiguity in the film that goes with theme of the movie the dehumanization of man and the resemblance between man and machine.

So after the fact, many years later(definitely not in 1982) Scott now wants to take away the ambiguity(just like Hauer saying Scott likes to mind ""F"") and flat out say Deckard is an android.  This is in opposition in how he actually filmed the movie originally, how the novel and scriptwriter wrote it, how the actors understood it and the logic of the film.  Scott now even says he had the idea of the narration in 1982(because film wasn't working originally) and that narration also is clear in showing Deckard is human with no late recognition of being an android and no unicorn shown...THIS SHOWS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF SCOTT AND THE FILM IN 1982.  The theme of the ambiguity/similiarity between man and android is clear--it would not work as android against android.  The film would be weaker then(having very little humanity) and fortunately it is not weaker since the clear signs show Deckard is human.",1198454400,11,3711,4.609756097560975

Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" to what we have now. The set is featured in a plastic briefcase, and contains conceptual art from Syd Mead, a hologram-esque film cell, a replica of Deckard's Spinner, and a replica of the origami unicorn.

109675,5,0790729628,"Let me explain where I'm coming from first so you can see my point.  I was very late to come to BluRay.  I am an avid moviephile and already had many, many DVDs in my library.  So it was with great reluctance that I bought my BlyRay player.  I bought about 20 DVDs right off the bat, most of them being the ones that were supposed to make the most of the format, including Fifth Element, 300, Planet Earth series, and the Pirates/Carribean series.  Now these movies did look and sound great, but I didn't think they warranted the huge upgrade in price.  Thankfully, Close Encounters came out and was SUPERB!  That was my fave until now.

Blade Runner is the BEST BluRay transfer I have seen to date.  And by a huge margin.  In the first 10 minutes when you see that dark cityscape you'll be in awe.  When Batty and Sebastian cruise up to the pyramid, the detail of the pyramid is breath taking.

As for the content, note that only the movie in all it's versions are bluray.  The discs with the extra content are NOT bluray even though they are included in the bluray set.  Not that they really need to be.

The story of the FInal Cut?  Brilliant. I loved Blade Runner and at 39 was a product of the 80's.  I used my swingset for the Millenium Falcon.  I was immersed in the Sci Fi of the day.  Even at that young age I love Blade Runned.  But this new ""Final Cut"" version really isn't just another rehash.  It's far more mature and more dark than it's original release.  Most notable is the absence of Deckard's constant inner monolgue/narration of the film.  No ""driving into the sunset"" happy ending.

So in conclusion, if you want a bluray disc that will really show off your system and amaze your friends, then Blade Runner is it.  If you're an avid fan of them film for years and are wondering if it's worth buying...yet again, then it most certainly is.  The quality is worth it alone, but the recut is actually very lovingly done.  All in all a true masterpeice of BluRay and it has raised the bar for what older movies can look like if they spend the time/money on them to make them look great.

And the additional features are great; good commentaries, a very good documentary, and more.

109677,5,0790729628,"I'm always skeptical when a studio promises an ""improved"" version of a personal favorite, since so many directors just don't know when to leave well enough alone.  To be quite honest, I wasn't too pleased with Ridley Scott's re-release of ""Legend"", so I had very guarded expectations coming into this purchase.

Without a doubt, ""Blade Runner"" is a cinematic high water mark -a resplendent, existential masterpiece drenched with subtlety and visual power.  I can honestly say that this film influenced my childhood more than any other -from the grim, dystopian future it forebodes, to the haunting and utterly unique Vangelis score.  With today's directors offering nothing but disposable summer blockbusters and CGI-soaked explosion-fests, this may very well be the last film of its kind.  So you can get a sense of my apprehension when I heard Ridley was finally going to release a cleaned-up special edition DVD.

Ridley, I'm sorry I doubted you.

The accompanying 3.5 hour documentary is unmatched for thoroughness and detail (save, perhaps for The LOTR trilogy SE releases -which, frankly wore thin after about the sixth hour of behind-the-sccenes coverage).  The documentary ALONE is worth the price of the set.

The film itself is indeed beautifully and flawlessly restored.  The promised ""extended footage"" and ""never-before-seen visual effects"" are subtly and expertly grafted into the film in a way that no other ""improved"" DVD has ever accomplished.  This time the tweaks are both respectful to fans' expectations and WELCOME.  If you've grown up hoping they'd do something about the occasional unfortunate matte painting/film color mismatch, or the handful of continuity errors in the last ""Director's Cut"", you will not be disappointed.

I spotted at least one change in the ending that finally resolves what many fans consider one of the film's more egregious missteps, and a reversion to the original intent of Batty's dialogue with Tyrell that (for me, at least) works every bit as well as the one we've been watching for the last twenty years.

About the only thing they didn't address in the supplemental disc (I've not yet watched the film with the commentaries, so this may be premature) is why it took so long to release this.  As any Blade Runner fan knows, the DVD release has been mired in controversy and speculation about legal battles for over a decade, yet no mention was made of ""why now?""

In any case, what difference does it make?  It's finally here.  And it is every bit worth the wait.",1198281600,7,2519,5.043478260869565
109678,5,0790729628,"Wow. Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" looks absolutely stunning in its Blu-ray presentation. Aside from Orson Welles' ""Mr. Arkadin"", there probably hasn't been a movie as fiddled with as ""Blade Runner"". This set features the 1) theatrical cut from 1982, 2) the ""International Cut"" which appeared on cable 3)the ""Work Print"" version which was premiered for a test audience and, aside from a showing at a film festival, hasn't been seen since 3)""The Director's Cut"" which was created after the buzz from the ""Work Print"" showing and created by Scott with Terry Rawlings the original editor tweaking the film (by eliminating the narration, adding in a Unicorn dream sequence -borrowed outtakes from ""Legend"" when the original footage couldn't be found-and with the more uncertain ending. The the film was trimmed here and there as well) and 4)""The Final Cut"" where Warner gave Scott, Rawlings and DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika the chance to go back and do fixes that Scott had always wanted to do such as digitally eliminating the cables lifting the Spinners, digitally eliminating crew members that were accidently seen in the edge of the frame, fixing continuity errors, backgrounds and tweaking the opening with the eye a bit.

The result is a ""Blade Runner"" OCD fan's dream--every version of the movie plus a brilliant three hour documentary ""Dangerous Days"" (Hampton Fancher's original title for his screenplay of Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?)directed by de Lauzirika (who used to be an assistant at Scott's Scott Free Productions)featuring archival and new interviews with all the usual suspects. I'm not sure if this was isolated to my disc but the documentary would occasionally stop for no reason. It could be that the firmware on my unit needs to be updated but I thought I would bring this up if others have any problems with the set.

The extras would take a day to run through. In the documentary we get a huge volume of deleted/alternate scenes, a pair of fascinating screen tests for the roles of Pris and Rachael (actors that were the first runners up for the roles), commentary tracks by author Paul Sammon (who wrote a series of terrific articles and a very good book on the film Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner), Scott, producer Michael Deeley, Production Executive Katherine Haber, Visual Futurist Syd Mead along with Visual Effects Supervisors Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich and writers Hampton Fancher & David Peoples (who pointedly state that they never intended Deckard to be a Replicant--Scott may feel that way in retrospect but I have always felt that it was much more metaphorical with Deckard becoming like a Replicant and rediscovering his humanity from Batty--something that adds power to the ending of the film. I suspect that Scott wasn't sure when he shot the film but has become convinced over the years that he did indeed intend that from the beginning).

Packaged in a very nice, slim Blu-ray case with a booklet featuring stills from the film, ""Blade Runner"" finally gets the love that it deserves. Luckily for us it didn't take a Criterion or 50 years to allow the film to get the recognition and appreciation it deserved (only 25).

109681,5,0790729628,"Described a few days ago by a public radio announcer as being a ""box office flop"" when it was released in 1982, this movie nevertheless has had a huge following since that time. Some have considered the movie as a warning against dangerous technological influences, while others, a small minority in fact; consider it a tour de force, as an indication of where technology is headed. If one examines the evidence carefully, there are strong indications that advances in genetic engineering and neuroscience will allow the kinds of beings portrayed in this film to be produced in the near future. These beings, called ""replicants"" in the movie, have mental and physical abilities that are enhanced to a large degree over the humans that surround them. These abilities were designed into them by their creators, with the hopes of using them to perform dangerous physical labor on the ""off-world"" colonies. All of the actors who portray the replicants in the movie give convincing performances, especially when displaying their emotional immaturity and their reaction to fear. In the latter, they are behaving like any ordinary human would: protecting themselves against forces that seek to destroy them.

Everything about this movie is interesting, and for a technophile it is an excellent vehicle with which to project oneself into a future that he may not get to experience. Indeed, there is so much to contemplate while viewing it: advanced space travel, flying cars, sophisticated toy robots, voice recognizing machines, the artificial owl and snake, and of course the advances in genetic engineering. But whether put in by the director on purpose or not, there are a few things in the movie that point to the limitations of scientific understanding at the time (2019). For example, the toy-maker J.F. Sebastian complains about having ""Methuselah syndrome"", which as he explains it is a form of accelerated aging, which prevents him from living in the off-world colonies. Medical science is apparently still not advanced enough to cure him of this illness. Another example is when Roy Batty challenges Eldon Tyrell to extend his lifetime to one that is greater than four years, but Tyrell gives Batty the biological reasons why this cannot be done. So even though genetic engineering is advanced enough to create functioning replicants, it is still unable to ""alter the coding sequence once it has been set"". These two examples exemplify the idea that there are always issues, problems, and areas that science has not yet explained, thus motivating further research.

The replicants Zhora and Pris are both sexually enticing figures in the movie, and of course this was by design. But they cannot compare to the desirability of Rachel, a special replicant designed by Tyrell and who totally overwhelms all the other characters in movie. Her fragility and naivet are to be contrasted with her sophistication in dress and demeanor. Every set she is in becomes her runway, but the best scene is when she first meets Rick Deckard, and asks him about the artificial owl. Her clothes, makeup, and hairstyle are pure twenty-first century, and naturally Deckard is very attracted to her, as any man would be. And in this regard it does not matter whether Rachel is a replicant or not. All that matters for an attraction to take place is the responses in the brains of both parties. This movie gives a glimpse of the love affairs between humans and machines that will be a common occurrence in this century, and there is no rational or ethical reason why they should not take place.

And far from being evil, the Tyrell Corporation exemplifies the kind of future that is ahead. No doubt corporations in this century will cause some difficult social problems, and technological advances of course have their negative ramifications (the ""acid rain"" and filthy streets in the movie), but these can be cured by new technology. Thus one technological advance requires another, and this one still another. Each advance seems to occur much more rapidly than the other, forcing an unrelenting march into the future. Sometimes this march can be as a drunkards walk, and sometimes it takes place with huge leaps, but as this movie and those it influenced after it was released portrays, there are always consequences, sometimes negative and sometimes positive. But far from being a dystopian vision of the future, this movie portrays one that all humans should strive for. And in the process of doing so, we will be assisted by the very technology we create. This technology will also develop its own vision of the future, and it might be very different from our own.",1198195200,6,4649,5.011642949547219

109687,5,0790729628,"I'm not going to rate the movie itself. I have already done that months ago. The five stars that I am giving are for the sheer presentation and production value of this collector's set.

Since the director's cut in 1992, there has been a bone of contention among fans of the film, and that was; which version is better? The one with the voiceover or the one without?

It doesn't matter because you get to choose which version you want to watch, PLUS one version that no one has ever seen before (the Final Cut) and one version that has not been seen by most (the workprint). You also get the 1992 director's cut, the original 1982 US theatrical release, and the 1982 international release. Five, count 'em, FIVE versions of the film to please everyone's tastes. You want voiceover and a happy ending? You got it. You want no voiceover and a gloomy ending? You got it. You want Deckard's unicorn dream sequence or do you prefer a half-drunk Deckard plinking away on the piano and staring at old family photos? Either way, you got it. NOW, STOP COMPLAINING!!!!!!!!!!

There are also numerous documentaries and behind-the-scenes featurettes from the past as well as some recorded for this new DVD edition. They are all VERY insightful and give you a whole new appreciation for what everyone went through to make Blade Runner a reality. How everyone managed NOT to kill one another during the film's production is beyond me. There are also a few really nice deleted scenes that give a bit more depth to the world that Ridley Scott had created.

With that out of the way, this masterpiece of sci-fi celluloid has finally been given a proper home video treatment after 25 years. Let's start with the case.

VERY nice. It's made of sturdy plastic, but painted to look like it's made of brushed aluminum. It resembles Deckard's Voight-Kampf case, but a slightly smaller version. The Blade Runner title logo and Harrison Ford's name is printed with raised lettering on the top cover.

When the case is opened, the first thing you seem to notice is the shiny origami unicorn replica (also made of plastic) and the spinner replica. Both are very detailed, not some cheap piece of junk that I was originally expecting. The ""toys"" are packed inside form-fitting foam (say THAT fast 3 times!) next to the DVD box which contains 5 discs. The DVD box itself is very nicely done with conceptual art and screen shots from the film on the inside covers. Each disc has different screenshots from the movie on them as well and are nicely presented.

On the inside top cover is a dossier-like folder containing conceptual art by Syd Mead on one side, and an actual screenshot of the corresponding artwork brought to life in the film itself on the other. There is also a ""holographic motion art"" mini-plaque that shows Deckard drawing his blaster just before entering his apartment to find a sleeping Rachael.

There is a clear piece of plastic that separates the top cover from the bottom, and a letter from Ridley Scott is printed on it telling you a little bit about what the set contains.

This product deserves 5 stars just for it's production value alone. A lot of thought, consideration, and love went into this limited edition DVD set. THIS is what Blade Runner fans (like me) have been waiting for for a LONG time!

If you are just a casual fan of Blade Runner, or if you've never seen it and would like to, there is a less-expensive version of this release out there that does not have the case or any of the ""toys"" or conceptual art. It is just a bare-bones case containing the same 5 discs you get with this limited edition set. There is also a version that has only the ""Final Cut"" and the ""Dangerous Days"" documentary dics that is even less expensive than that.

Again, there is something for everyone and something within everyone's price range to celebrate the 25th anniversary of such a landmark film.",1198108800,11,3895,4.646802325581396

I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhuser Gate.

And I've seen the ultimate presentation of ""Blade Runner"".

""Blade Runner"" has always been one of my three favorite movies (the other two being Ridley Scott's other masterpiece, ""Alien"", and James Cameron's ""Aliens""). The very first DVD I bought back in 1997, before I even owned a DVD player, was ""Blade Runner""; it was my litmus test to see if this new DVD movie format was any good. And boy-oh-boy, was it ever. But over time, the original ""Blade Runner"" DVD has really shown its age. It had no extras, terrible picture quality compared to current DVDs, and inferior sound.

So now we have the HD-DVD Ultimate Collector's Edition of ""Blade Runner"". I could write a magnum opus about everything that is good about this set, but I just want to concentrate on the really, really important stuff.

First, the picture and sound quality is simply amazing. The entire film has been remastered in 4K and 8K high-definition, and every frame painstakingly cleaned of dust and scratches. The result is a totally immersive cinematic experience that looks as good now as when the movie was first released in 1982 (it may even be better). Simply breathtakingly good.

Second, CGI and reshoots have been used to clean up all of the niggly little mistakes that have been in the movie all of these years. Wires holding up the spinners, the obvious stuntwoman when Zhora crashes through the glass, Deckard's mouth not matching his spoken words when talking to Abdul Ben Hassan, the wrong cityscape when the dove takes off, the finger on Batty's shoulder when he's in the Vid-Phon booth. All of these, and more, have been fixed, absolutely seamlessly.

And finally, the continuity errors that plagued previous releases have all been corrected. For example, now there were TWO replicants that got fried running through an electrical field, so the numbers through the rest of the movie all make sense.

The result of all of this is that the best SF movie ever, and one of the best overall movies ever, is now as close to perfect as it's ever going to get.

Add to all of that the 4 OTHER versions of the movie, including the legendary Workprint; all of the supplemental materials, deleted scenes, documentaries; and the cool toys in the box.

This set is absolutely worth buying. I'd give it 6 stars if the system would let me.",1198108800,4,2426,4.741092636579572
109689,5,0790729628,"I'm not going to bother reviewing the film. Its awesome. Its awesome having all five versions in the same box together.

What's **more** awesome is the documentary, ""Dangerous Days"". Its extremely detailed, exhaustively researched and (amazingly!) never boring. Topping out at nearly four hours, I actually managed to get through it in one sitting. This is compelling stuff.

The doc is not one of those ""HBO Sneek Peek"" affairs where everyone is compelled to heap praise on one another. While there may be a few punches pulled, you'll still notice actors or gaffers or writers or producers damning each other with faint praise. And Harrison Ford swears. Alot!

What's more, other rising stars in the world of cinema weigh in on the impact of Blade Runner in their world. Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption), Ronald Moore (BSG, Star Trek), Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Devil's Backbone) and more show up to pontificate poetically on what Blade Runner meant to them.

""Dangerous Days"" leaves no stone left unturned. Its honest and straightforward. I left it feeling much more informed about the creative process than in other docs such as ""Hearts of Darkness"".

If you are a Blade Runner fanatic, I think your choice is made. Now you just gotta figure out whether or not the plastic case and the ""Spinner"" replica is worth another 30-40 bucks.

NOTE - ""Dangerous Days"" is not in HD, j ustregular old 480P. This applies to both the BluRay and HDDVD versions.",1198108800,9,1466,4.963265306122449

The sound and picture on ALL the versions is impeccable and you can see the evolution of the film in these 4 prints.  I had the priviledge to see the ""Work Print"" at a theater in Seattle about 6 or so years ago...I have no idea how they got it or why they played it because everyone in the theater was completely surprised - you know the minute the movie starts that this is not the same ""Blade Runner"" from 1982.  It is interesting as a one-time view but after that has little relevance.  If needed rent the 5-disc set and watch it once.  Also, the ""Dangerous Days...""  making of documentary is simply one of the best I've ever seen, well worth the price just by itself.

Also, for your money you get THE ANSWER to THE QUESTION:

In a critical interview on Disc 2 ""Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner,"" Ridley Scott says the following in reference to the unicorn scenario:

""I want to see what's inside his {Deckard's} head, so it better be something extraordinary. So, he is a romantic because he's thinking about this unicorn {in the piano apartment scene} ... And so that at the end of the film, I can have something absolutely remarkable which I can illustrate, which is the unicorn ... and he goes like ""Boom!"" {when he picks up the origami unicorn.} How would anyone have known what was inside his head, other than someone who knew what was in his file? That had been implanted in his brain? Can't be any clearer than that. If you don't get it, you're a moron.""",1198108800,4,1040,4.550802139037433

While watching this movie, i tried to keep in mind that this movie was made in 82...

Movie: For the most part, the movie was really good. F*&king weird at the end... but it was pretty good. And i'm sure it was a great movie back in the days. but... i watched it with an open mind and i found that the movie was worth the buy.

Video: Man, i was totally amazed by the video quality of this movie. I've always thought that some of the movies remade on blu-ray didn't look as good because it was such an old film but i was proved wrong by this movie. It's definately a 5.

Audio: Holy Moly. I truly-truly, enjoyed the sound quality of this movie. I felt like my surround sound was truly being used throughout the movie and that it was being used well. The movie has alot of flying cars flying around you and you can really feel it because of the surround sound makes sure of it!

Extras: I put N/A because i haven't looked into it as much and i feel like i won't have the opportunity anytime soon. All i know is that there are 4 extra disk.

All in all, i'm guessing this flick was ahead of its time in 1982...  and watching it now wasn't so bad either.. and the blu-ray version is amazingly awesome.",1198022400,4,1393,4.137037037037037
109696,5,0790729628,"What can I say? The wait was well worth it. It's taken over 25 years for this movie to be released on DVD since it came out in the theaters and this release does not disappoint in the least.

First off, the V-K case is great. It's made of a very sturdy plastic and is not flimsy at all. Just carrying it you can feel the weight of all that is included with this set which is great. There are two push buttons that unlock the case and it opens up. In the lid is a dossier folder containing various rare art prints for many scenes in the movie. There is also a motion film clip picture containing a scene from the movie.

In the bottom part of the case placed into cut-out foam is the 5-disc movie box containing 5 DVDs and a booklet, a spinner replica and a plastic origami unicorn.

The 5 discs contain over 9 hours of film and features. None of them disappoint and they are all worth their weight in gold.

Disc 1 is the Final Cut. This is the definitive version of the movie. No voice-over, restored picture which looks wonderful and vibrant and other touch ups that do not destroy the integrity of the movie. Some of the ""changes"" include cables that were attached to the spinners for a crane have been digitally removed; dialog and lip synchronization has been fixed during the scene with the snake dealer; digitally put Joanna Cassidy's head on the stunt double's body during the windows stunt scene and many other minor fixes that do nothing but enhance the movie. No replacing of special effects since they don't need it.

Disc 2 contains a three-and-a-half hour feature called Dangerous Days that goes through the entire life of the movie from concept to release. This has to be the most complete ""making of"" feature I've seen since the release of the extended editions of the LOTR movies. Just wonderful to watch and interesting.

Disc 3 contains the US theatrical, European theatrical (which is the common VHS version) and the '92 Director's Cut, all seamlessly branched together and each one has a introduction by Ridley.

Disc 4 contains a lot more background information about the movie and Phillip K. Dick. The interviews are with people not associated with the movie as well as people that were behind the scenes. One featurette that was very interesting was the comparison between the book and the movie. There are also original making of features from 1982 when the movie was ready for release. Nostalgic and very interesting to watch!

Disc 5 contains the work print version that was shown as the preview before the movie came out. The Final Cut is very similar to this one but there is a different beginning, some scenes shortened and some different music. It's about 7 minutes shorter than the Final Cut but it's a nostalgic piece of history that some have never been able to see and now you have the chance. The sound and picture aren't bad but they could only touch it up so much. It's very watchable and it's interesting to see how Ridley initially released the movie to the public to preview.

Also included on the fifth disc is a 30-minute feature that shows how the various versions of the film came to be and how the Final Cut was finally created.

For collectors, this is the movie set to get. If you are a true Blade Runner fan, there is no other option. Definitely the best DVD collection set I've seen yet.",1198022400,6,3337,4.528239202657807
109697,5,0790729628,"I see a lot of opinions from folks who say the director's cut is better than the theatrical release.  But the main reason given is because that's the way R.Scott originally intended for it to be.  That's not much of a reason.  I've held somewhat of a grudge against Mr. Scott for a while because he's the main reason I could not get a DVD copy of the theatrical version.  I saw the theater version in the early 80's on VHS and loved it so much I wore out the tape.  When the director's cut came out eventually on DVD, I was disappointed that the movie was not as I remembered it.  The narration adds such a great feel to the movie.  I don't think it was over-done, meaning, it didn't dumb the movie down by trying to dictate to the audience what to think as they were watching.  The narration didn't try to fill in all the blanks or define each scene.  It simply gave a glimpse into the mind of the main character and, in my opinion, gave the movie more depth.  And, as I said, it gave such a great film-noir feel, which is one of the reasons I loved it so much the first time I saw it.  This movie is one of my all-time favorites and I will spend extra for the set, knowing that I will only ever watch the theatrical version.
As for the rating, the five stars is certainly for the movie itself.  Having to buy 5 discs to get the one I want is irritating, to say the least.",1198022400,11,1373,4.082089552238806

There are a total of 5 discs in this set. 3 of the discs are HD DVDs, and 2 are standard DVDs. The different versions of the film are on the High Definition discs, and the supplemental material are standard DVDs. If you've never seen this film before, now is the best time, because it's never looked better visually.

109702,5,0790729628,"I was 18 years old in 1982 when I saw the original release of Blade Runner.  I was mesmerized with Blade Runner and I have been ever since.  Can you imagine my longsuffering all these 25 years?  Like so many, I have waited, first for the long awaited soundtrack, and now this.  I didn't feel the need for the 5 disc set and I have no regrets having purchased the 4 disc box set.  As of this writing, I have only viewed the 4th disc called the Enhancement Archive. (kinda like eating the side dishes/veggies before I savor the big steak) AMAZING!  Finally, I am getting my satisfactory fill and I'm just loving it.  For any of you considering just the two disc set, you must spend the extra to get this 4th disc alone.  I must say the segment on the director of photography, Jordan Croneweth, is so touching and insightful.

Since purchasing the movie yesterday from the local Borders bookstore, I have been walking the streets of Seattle in the December gloom and pouring rain--living like so many in the movie--under my umbrella.  I have been walking among the large assortment of homeless (Seattle is a utopia for the homeless) and the ubiquitous Asian population and I feel such a kinship with the movie.

I'd like to share a little tidbit from the 4th disc.  I don't recall which segment, but it shows a take of Rutger Hauer (Roy Batty) doing his poignant last scene and then you see the movie clapper board to end the take.  Someone comes up to Hauer and puts their hand on his shoulder as to congratulate him on a good job, he smiles and then seems to lose it a little bit emotionally.  It's subtle, but demonstrates the pathos he, the human being, must have felt doing that scene. What more can I say? It is just a great feeling to have all these treats to relish again and again.

One last thing... I'm in the camp that likes to examine all the clues that suggest Deckard may be a replicant, but in the end I believe he's really not a replicant.  He's a human who seemed to have lost his humanity over time with his career, divorce, etc. but then regained it from his life, death and love experiences with this group of replicants.

109707,5,0790729628,"Wow. You could call this overkill or OCD in action but Warner has assembled the ultimate edition of ""Blade Runner"" for its anniversary. Many others have noted what's included here so I'll comment on them briefly and then address image quality, etc.

This is the only place on regular DVD to get ALL versions of the movie and documentary plus extras. The Blu-ray and HD-DVD however are available with all of this but the toys and case. There is also a two disc set that includes the Final Cut and the documentary Dangerous Days as well as a four disc edition that has everything BUT the work print version of the film.

Here's the run down:

1) The original theatrical release from 1982 unaltered.
2) The ""International Release"" again unaltered.
3) The ""Director's Cut"" released in the 90's and the only version available on DVD until now in the United States.
All three of these are on a single seamlessly branching disc where you select which version you want to watch. That's good news for those who love the original theatrical release with the narration, those that grew used to watching the international version which is exactly the same except for two minutes of extended violence. It was this version that showed up on home video. The ""Director's Cut"" shares more in common than differences between the other two with the narration missing and the happy ending as well as some minor trims here and there.

4) ""The Final Cut"" is on disc one of the set. This edition which has many tweaks including the cleaning up of continuity errors that Scott would have fixed if he had the time back in the 90's and 80's  (and the money to do so). This includes digitally removed the cable that hoists the Spinners, removing a bruise from Harrison Ford's face when the fight with Leon was placed AFTER Zora's killing (dramatically it made sense to put it after but it was originally before Zora's killing), replacing the stunt woman's face with Joanna Cassidy's so it looks good (Cassidy would have done the stunt if she had been asked but this is the next best thing since, again, if fixes a major glaring error), the ORIGINAL Unicorn scene shot for the movie but left out of the final version restored to the film and various other minor tweaks, a brief clip of the infamous scene of the dancing girls wearing the hockey masks.

5) The famous ""Workprint"" version that differs signficantly in some areas including a different opening title sequence and other minor differences. Although this isn't the ""Director's Cut"" version, its showing at a film festival is what prompted Scott and Warner to go back and create the ""Director's Cut"". This edition looks the worst of the five versions of the film presented here simply because the source material always looked much grainier and never looked as pristine as the final cut. The opening titles on this edition are completely different and there are other differences as well that fans will pick up.

6)""Dangerous Days"" (the title of the original screenplay)a full length 3 hour documentary on the trials and tribulations that Scott, Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast and crew went through to make ""Blade Runner"". This documentary is very fair balanced and covers the very conception of the film when Hampton Fancher optioned Dick's novel, interested producer Michael Deeley to Scott's involvement. It does skirt over the involvement and interest of other directors (and there were a few). Scott initially passed on the project and was set to direct Dino DeLaurentiis production of ""Dune"" until his older brother died. After that, he decided he didn't want to spent all the pre-production time on ""Dune"" and re-evaluated his priorities jumping on the project but also demanding rewrites from Fancher and eventually bringing in writer David Peoples (""Unforgiven"", ""Soldier""--which interestingly enough is what Peoples calls ""an indirect"" sequel to ""Blade Runner"" set in the same universe). Writer Paul Sammon (who provides a commentary track for ""Blade Runner"")wrote an excellent book that covers much of the same ground and appears discussing various aspects of production--this is essentially that book in documentary form.

Various toys including a Spinner and a Unicorn along with other cool collectable are in a nice little box that resembles the brief case that Deckard carries around the Voight-Kaumpf machine in. Fans of the film will probably want this edition but those who just want the movies may want to pick up the Blu-ray, HD-DVD five disc editions or, if you're willing to NOT have the workprint version, the four disc edition on DVD.

Image quality is stellar. The film has never looked this good in any of its incarnations. Personally, I would go for the high definition Blu-ray or HD-DVD since both have all the film versions plus the documentary without the toys unless you want the collectable case, etc. I've never seen ""Blade Runner"" looking this crisp. The standard regular DVD multi-disc sets are as follows (without the brief case)

The discs are as follows:

1. ""Final Cut"" with a new digital remaster with commentary tracks.
2. Disc two has ""Dangerous Days""
3. Disc three has all three versions of the film outside of the previously mentioned ""Final Cut"".
4. Disc four has the ""Enhancement Archives"" which includes documentaries on writer Philip K. Dick, his legacy and a comparison between the novel and film highlighting how Scott and his collaborators created a work that compliments the film finding film equivelents to Dick's vision.

For those that pick up the Blu-ray or HD-DVD versions of the film in the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" or the five disc release be aware that some extras here are not in high definition.

This is a terrific set and the only place for regular DVD to get the ""Work Print"" version.",1197936000,8,5794,4.9

109710,5,0790729628,"I loved this film when I saw it at the movies in 1982. It only got better with the small adjustments, losing the voiceover and all that. I was surprised to find the US had never seen the version the UK got. When I bought my first VHS machine in 1987 this was my first tape, when I got my first DVD player in 1999 this was my first DVD. It will probably be my first HD-DVD, when they end the format wars.

But here we have the final cut. Some of the dialog has been adjusted, it's subtle and I'm far from convinced it was necessary and don't always agree with the change, but that's fine. The movie finally scans right for the US audience, it makes sense the way Ridley Scott always intended it to. So it is the definitive version and I expect to watch it often.

But the thing that makes it worth every single cent is the director's commentary by Ridley Scott. This is an outstanding and wonderfully informative commentary. He goes in to the background of details, Rutger Hauer penned the final version of Roy's last words, Harrison Ford came up with the blood in the glass and catching the bottle as he sat up. Loads more. But there's also details on the methods used to achieve the lighting effects, like how the owl's eyes light up and why he used it on Sean Young later. He even explains why some people thing Deckard is a replicant.

Excellent. Christmas came early for me.",1197936000,3,1378,4.312741312741313

In his confrontation with Tyrell, does Batty say ""father"" or f***er""?

109712,5,0790729628,"As an avid fan of both the film Blade Runner and the book by Philip K Dick, I was very excited about this ""final cut"" as the original director's cut DVD was totally lacking in all areas.  The Final Cut has definitely cleaned up the picture and the 5.1 is truly magnificent... Scott says that Vangelis' Blade Runner score has to be his best score and to hear in in 5.1, you want to agree with him.  The ads for this release make it sound like there are loads of changes and additional footage and this and that, but if you're looking for a bunch of added stuff, you're going to be disappointed.  There are a lot of things that have been done to the film to clean it up in the way of digital edits and there is additional footage, but according to Scott in the commentary, this version of the film is the shortest version in existence.  The clean picture and the sound is well enough reason to get this version for your collection.  But you're also getting full commentaries from Scott and two additional commentaries from the screen writers and others that helped in making this film, not to mention the second disk with the documentary Dangerous Days that goes into the making of the film.  This entire documentary is over three hours and thirty minutes and includes a number of deleted scenes, random shots, extended scenes, pictures of the pre-production... they talk about the fifth replicant ""mary"" and a cut story line involving Tyrell being an android himself.  There are filmed auditions and interviews from cast and crew... it is truly a definitive account of the making of the film and I can't say I've ever seen such a documentary for a film.

I loved the first version I saw years ago and own on tape. So I was disappointed with the latest final cut.  While the picture quality is outstanding, I missed the voiceover narrative that makes Deckard the central character and lets us see the story though his mind and emotions. This time there's hardly any distinction between him and the replicants which I suspect is what the director wanted -- to blur distinctions between humans and replicants as much as possible.

I miss Deckard's musing about why Roy let him live and I liked the getaway on the train and the notion expressed by Harrison Ford rather than Olmos, that we don't know when Rachel or anyone else's number will be up. And I agree that for some odd reason we have less sympathy for the replicants in this version.

Not only does the narration aid in giving you Deckard's p.o.v. and evolving character development, but is essential in making (albeit, only some) sense of the story.  The ""Final Cut"" adds very little other than a few seconds of beautiful visuals extending 4-5 scenes, but the expanded score (and I do LOVE the score) actually undercuts certain scenes where silence was much more effective.

I am not sure why people like the version with no narration, adding a scene that might suggest Deckard is a replicant & cutting off the upbeat ending.

B Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

C India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mainland China, Pakistan, Russia, Central and South Asia.

Responding to persistent questions from early adopters on both sides of the aisle, Warner has provided further details on the exact configuration of its upcoming high-def 'Blade Runner' releases.

As officially announced late last month, Warner Home Entertainment will at last be debuting the definitive 'Blade Runner' in two editions apiece on Blu-ray and HD DVD. Set to street on December 18 are 'Blade Runner: The Complete Collector's Edition' and the even more elaborately-packaged 'Blade Runner: The Ultimate Collector's Edition,' each a five-disc set boasting several different versions of the film and hours of newly-produced bonus content.

Since that announcement, speculation has run rampant over just how much of the material on these mammoth sets would be presented in full high-definition. (Warner famously released the HD DVD edition of 'The Ultimate Matrix Collection' last May with the final two discs presented in standard-def, a fact that wasn't revealed until just days before that disc's release.)

This time around, the studio apparently going the full disclosure route, revealing to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits that while all five versions of the film included on the next-gen releases are being mastered in actual 1080p video, all of supplementary materials (including the new documentary ""Dangerous Days,"" and the deleted scenes) will be presented in 480p standard definition only.

According to Hunt, Warner says the reason for this has nothing to do with disc space on either format, but rather the compressed time schedule in which the various extras are being produced.

Warner has set a $39.95 list price for the five-disc 'Complete Collector's Edition' of 'Blade Runner,' while the deluxe 'Ultimate Collector's Edition' (featuring the same disc configurations but with special ""Deckard Briefcase"" packaging and other collectibles) will list for $99.95.

The voiceover added just the right touch to fill the empty parts. And as I didn't know at the time- echoed the idea that this was a futuristic film noir. The unicorn thing is stupid- Period. Deckard is not a replicant. The whole point of the story was he was more dangerous than any replicant, and that it took a replicant for him to become a human again. The original ending is the best as well- what the hell is wrong with having an element of hope?? That is part of what makes of human. What is wrong with Deckard actually finding true love-- Just like Luca$ don't screw with the magic- because then it isn't magic anymore- Ridley Scott doesn't get to decide that Deckard is a replicant- the writers never intended that- and if he is one- why we would he get his butt handed to him throughout the whole movie??",1195689600,10,930,4.350574712643678

I have no doubt that H.G Wells, and Aldous Huxley were just that. With George Orwell its debatable whether or not he was a propagandist working for them, or if he was warning us about them. Either way he worked for them at one time writing war time propaganda for the BBC, as well as being active in Communist and Socialist movements in his younger days. So regardless he had gotten a glimpse into the belly of the beast so he was privy to inner knowledge. As far as Phillip K. Dick I don't think there's any evidence that he was working for ""them"" but I did pick up on stuff in Blade Runner that are reality today that I don't see how they could have known about back when this movie was made (was it the early 80s?) Like there's all this stuff with eye scanning for example. The public had no knowledge of this back then, but its real now. I haven't read any of Dicks books so maybe the eye scanning and other stuff was added to the film by Hollywood and not pulled from his stories. But anyway as far as the story itself and just being entertained I loved Blade Runner just as much as I did when I saw it years and years ago.",1195084800,2,1419,4.126353790613718
109738,5,0790729628,"I was 25 years old in 1982, and remember going to the theater with much anticipation when this came out.  I was mesmerized, and astounded.  A new level of cinematic power was born.  A masterpiece of science fiction for the ages.

No way to count the number of times I viewed it between then and now.  The attention to detail in every scene just overwhelming.

The one thing I remember, between VHS tapes, and DVD copies, is that the color of Taffy Lewis velour jacket in the club, was never quite the same as it was on the film.  Bluish, or purplish, or somewhere in between.  I always hoped in some distant future, I could have a copy where the masterpiece was in all it's forms perfected to that first viewing from 1982 on fresh film print stock.

Maybe this is it.  To be entertained, by some sort of dazzlement, and philosophical depth.  A Rembrandt portrait, a Beethoven symphony, and Blade Runner.  I await the HD set, glad that I made it a quarter-century later.  My hair is gray, and time has beat me up a little.  2017 just 10 years off now.

109741,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner.  The name alone conjures up an ambience, a palpable onscreen mood that many directors have attempted to replicate for 25 years now.  The film's monumental influence on the substance and style of science fiction is indisputable, with echoes of Ridley Scott's dark vision and interpretation of Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"" continuing to haunt a number of notable productions, most recently that of the ""reimagined"" Battlestar Galactica and the new Cylons who struggle with determining who they are and how to relate to their human creators.  The philosophical concept of what humanity is, both to humans and to the machines they've created in their own image, continues to be a theme that resonates.

This ""Final Cut"" of Blade Runner does not offer any new insights into that premise that the ""Director's Cut"" did not provide fifteen years ago.  There are some minor changes to dialogue and special effects that will continue to be debated by the fans, but by and large this is the Blade Runner that comes closest to Scott's true vision.

For the fans, the most important point of note is that the visual quality has been cleaned up and given the professional treatment that such an amazing film deserves [presumably, that is -- I write this after only having seen the ""Final Cut"" in the theater].  No more will we have to watch the wobbly and muddy straight-from-vhs transfer of the ""Director's Cut"" dvd and bemoan the fact that the movie was treated like an unwanted stepchild by all parties involved.  Perhaps with it's release Ridley and co. can finally let go of the film that caused so much bitterness and heartache during it's production and marketing.",1194480000,4,1697,4.909090909090909
109742,4,0790729628,"Set in Los Angeles in November 2019, Harrison Ford stars as the ""blade runner"" Rick Deckard, a special police officer who must track down and ""retire"" four ""replicants"" who have returned to earth from ""off-world"" colonies. Their crime is that they want to be fully human; as it is, they are genetically manipulated humanoids, virtually indistinguishable from normal humans except that they are superior in strength and intellect, lack full emotions, and have a life span of four years. Deckard falls in love with Rachel, a fifth, experimental replicant who thinks she is truly human, and there are ambiguities that Deckard himself might be a replicant (""Did you ever take the test yourself?"") and in the way the film ends. Blade Runner fared poorly when it was released in 1982, the same weekend as ET, but since then it has become a cult classic that regularly appears on lists of the best films ever. Much more than a sci-fi thriller, which it is, the film explores nothing less than what it means to be human in a very dark world. The year 2007 marks its twenty-fifth anniversary, and since its original release there have been seven versions of the film, including The Final Cut (2007)--notable because it's the only version over which the director Ridley Scott had total control.

109743,1,0790729628,"I have seen both the original cut and the final cut on the big screen. The first Blade Runner left me feeling elated, entertained and full of inspiration. This tired retread left me feeling disgusted and flat.

Why disgusted? In the first Blade Runner we witness the snapping of an important man's neck. The one scene in the whole movie that I could have done without, but it didn't ruin the movie for me! At least it was an instant death. This time in the film, for some godforsaken reason, the director had the replicant's kill by pushing people's eyeballs into their brains. It's horrifically shown once and implied twice. Now what possibly does that add to the movie? Is society becoming so sick that Hollywood thinks that's entertainment? Are we so desensitized that gruesome violence no longer revolts? All it did was turn the bad guys (replicants) into monsters. One is left without an once of sympathy for them unlike in the original Blade Runner.

Why flat? Well the speech at the end of the film by the dying replicant leader now rings quite hollow. Who gives a hoot what wonders he's seen. Just hurry up and die so you don't kill anymore decent people. While those replicant designers were short sighted and a certainly terribly naive, does that warrant a death sentence? The replicants are like spoiled children: If I don't get my way, I'm gonna throw a tantrum! In this case if you don't ""fix me"" I'm gonna push your eyeballs back into your brain! The other reason it left me flat was the ""boy meets girl ending"" is so trite! At least the original Blade Runner had what I would consider a passionate ending by a being that does not torture its victims.

Too bad Hollywood doesn't pay its writers better, instead of forcing them to go on strike. Maybe then we would have some really daring sci-fi film making instead of this tripe!

How anybody could like the Director's cut is beyond me. Give me the original movie. The Decker voice over to me gives it that film noir quality of an old Sam Spade movie. I wish that the 1982 version was released by itself, but now I have to fork over big bucks just to  own the original in DVD. I have never read the book that the movie was based on as I could care less as I just like movies for my escapism and only read non-fiction. I could only give this a 4 stars as the price is too high and it includes the directors cut.

1. The scene in the middle of the film, where Rachel asks Deckard about her incept date, and the question upsets him, makes no sense in relation to the tacked on happy ending of the 1982 version, but makes perfect  sense in light of how the Director's Cut ends.

2. With the voice over narration gone, you can hear all of the Vangelis music.

I just saw the new Final Cut at the Uptown in Washington, DC, and, though it's not much different from the Director's Cut, I think it's marginally the best version.  Among the subtle changes to the dialogue is one that fixes a continuity error existing in all the previous versions.  Regarding the six Replicants that escaped from Off-World, ""One of them got fried running though an electrical field"" is changed to ""Two of them got fried running through an electrical field.""

109756,4,0790729628,"I had the opportunity to see the new ""Final Cut"" of BLADE RUNNER on screen in New York City this past weekend.  As always, it's one of my favorite science fiction films of all time and I welcome any opportunity to see it on the big screen, in any version.

First, I have to say that I saw this when it was first released in June 1982.  The original theatrical version with Harrison Ford's voice-over and the Hollywood happy ending is still and will always be my favorite version.  That said, the only thing I can honestly claim is an improvement with the ""Final Cut"" is the sharper, remastered print.  As far as the film itself, it is almost completely identical to the 1992 Director's Cut.  There are some extra pieces of dialogue and extended scenes thrown in, which in my opinion, don't expand the film at all.  The added scenes of violence are not new to the BLADE RUNNER fan.  They've been available for view ever since the film first appeared on video cassette in the '80's.

If you already own the Director's Cut of BLADE RUNNER on DVD, then save your money.  Buying it all over again for the ""Final Cut"" will not gain you much, except a larger hole in your wallet.",1191801600,106,1172,4.409302325581395

The difference from the version I remember is like night and day. Unfortunately a DVD denies one the opportunity to watch it on a 52'x20' screen with an audience of 1200 people. But rather than rub that in, I'll just say that this is a movie that is SO much better now than it was in 1982. Watch it on the largest screen you can get your hands on and invite as many people as you can to watch it with you.

Don't get me wrong, I love the movie.  I saw it during its initial run and since then, it's been one of my all-time faves.  What I can't stand is hype.  I'm thinking of canceling my pre-order of this 5-disc set since I can't afford to waste any money on supposedly different ""versions"" of the film with only subatomic-level differences.

Giving it 4 stars for the film itself, but it should be more like 3.5 for the failure of this new version to deliver on the build-up.",1191628800,12,745,4.728682170542636

109760,5,0790729628,"The words ""Ultimate Edition"" are thrown around a lot with DVDs these days. But this one finally looks to live up to, and even exceed, the word ""Ultimate"".

Fans of Blade Runner have been in for a rough treatment over the years. For a time getting a genuine copy of Blade Runner on DVD was a rarity because there were so few in print. The movie was not the darling of the film world when it first come out, so being a fan of Blade Runner back then was like being in a small dedicated cult. Which is exactly the best way to describe Blade Runner, the biggest cult classic of all time.

We were also tempted with rumours of the famous ""master copy"", the copy of Blade Runner that had no alterations to it, nothing cut out and no voice overs added in. The want, no the NEED for this master copy was tremendous with us fans, not least of all because there has been so much said about which version is best, talks about how Ridley Scott was forced to do a screen freindly version, how Harrison Ford was forced to do a voice over at the last minute (which is he allegedly did half arsed in the hope that it would be unusable and wouldn't make the cut) and we were even given a ""directors cut"" which not even the director was happy with. But here it is in this ultimate collectors edition, all copies of the movie AND the master cut in HD DVD. It really doesn't get any better than this.

Well it does actually. You get all the extras that Blade Runner dvds had been missing all these years, you get it all in a Voight-Kampff style suitcase (Voight-Kampff being the famous android test from the films), you get the famous spinner toy car (the flying car that was even referenced in the Star Wars movies, look it up on imdb), you get a cheeky reference to the famous endings I was talking about with the unicorn figurine. You even get one of those movie frames that people keep putting on their book cases, you know like the star wars film frames some people have. It's all here and it's all coming soon, and it is all worth 70 measly bucks after a 25 year wait. For hardcore Blade Runner/sci fi fans I couldn't recommend this enough. For movie fans there is the same set on HD DVD, but you don't get the physical extras like the figurines or the suitcase, but it is half the price of the suitcase edition.

25 years in the making this collectors edition was, and it looks like we are finally being rewarded for our enthusiasm for this film. And what an outstanding reward it is =D",1191283200,18,2472,4.264392324093817
109761,5,0790729628,"...but I will be seeing more BLADE RUNNER than ever before.  The one-star review from the guy in Flagstaff has a point: we're reviewing something we haven't seen.  BUT the serious BLADE RUNNER fans aren't completely in the dark on this project.
Just look through the other reviews: they have the entire history of the versions down!

I remember watching BLADE RUNNER in Columbus, Ohio in the summer of 1982 to a mostly empty movie theatre.  There was me, my brother and a friend.  And we all loved it and couldn't figure out why more people weren't onboard for it.
(Everyone else was at that other summer movie in '82: Spielberg's E.T.  Other complaints I'd heard was that BLADE RUNNER wasn't the kinetic thrill ride of Harrison Ford's previous movie, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK).

When I went away to college, BLADE RUNNER was being screened in the Student Union in the mid-1980s.  When I went back to visit a few years ago, BLADE RUNNER was STILL being screened in the Student Union (talk about a time-warp: sitting there with an ex-girlfriend who still lived there 20-some years later with BLADE RUNNER playing nearby).

I know I'll be first in line to get this 5-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition and will watch all the discs.  I've read the excellent ""Future Noir: The Making of BLADE RUNNER"" book and recommend it for the serious fan.  There have also been a series of excellent magazine articles this year since it's the 25-year anniversary of the film's release (you can probably google them).

There were two movies in the summer of 1982 whose look and influence are still being felt in film: BLADE RUNNER and THE ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2).",1191283200,,1645,4.693379790940766
109762,5,0790729628,"I can't think of any other truly perfect film that was given a very different directors' cut years later and is still just as good.

I believe this is in fact the first director's cut of any movie to be released. The original Harrison Ford voice-over is missing, which really dulls some of the great film noir-of-the-future vibe that makes this so special. What is better, however, is that now we hear much more of Vangelis' fabulous score, gorgeous music which resonates so well with the sublime images that Scott crafted so splendidly.

I first saw this the weekend it opened; the theatre was hushed in awe throughout, and everyone applauded at the end. It has only improved with age. Neon-lit wet streets filled with shadowy underworld denizens of our crowded future, endless detail in every frame, imagination spilling from every scene; this film is made to be seen over and over. It's a magic spell that takes you to a unique place in your brain.

I think Philip K. Dick would approve heartily of this treatment of his story; Electric Sheep is a typically fine Dick work, but it is even more fully turned out here, and with so much feeling.

Above all, this film has heart, and makes you feel, not a typical science fiction accolade. Ford couldn't be better, and Rutger Hauer almost steals the show. It's one of those rare films that spills over with x-factor, and every supporting performance rings true.

I will NEVER grow tired of watching this every year, and am really looking forward to seeing the old version again when this is rereleased in the new, somewhat overkill 5-dvd version. It's cash-in time for Ridley! Still, he deserves it. You know a movie is classic when you can get away with that.

109763,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner is a movie based in Los Angeles in 2019. The environment is pretty much destroyed, and industrialization triumphs over nature. The result is no viable nature whatsoever, but a Mega-opolis in pretty much Post Apocalyptic Earth( the native language is a mix of Hungarian, Chinese, Japanese and English)

The story involves 6 replicants that have escaped from an Off World colony( as they were slaves) and have come to exact revenge, or a longer lifespan if they can. However there is more to it than just that... the replicant's have 4 year lifespan for fear they become aware of their own emotions, and do irrational things.

Deckard is a former Blade Runner, re-commissioned by his old boss to hunt down the 4. He sees that not only are the replicants more Human than expected, they outgrow their programming and ARE living, breath physical objects.

The story is ironic as well as tragic as the replicants die, as near the end Deckard is skeptical if he is one as well. However, this is a great movie Rutger Hauer's first American movie, and Harrison Ford fresh off Return of The Jedi is excellent. Highly recommended for Sci-Fi fanatics.

I have the original directors cut within my possession, I am looking forward however to getting the 4 disc special edition to see the major differences in the edits.",1190505600,3,1319,4.797356828193832
109764,5,0790729628,"5+ stars easily.  A great sci-fi book by P K Dick was turned into a great movie directed by the talented Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, ...)  Harrison Ford is perfect and there are a number of other well-known actors in this such as Rutger Hauer, who is amazing in his role.  I think I read that he came up with part of his closing monologue. The music is by Vangelis.

The tempestuous story of its filming has been documented in books.  I really think that this is a sci-fi movie that can be put on the level of, say, Metropolis in terms of its influence, themes, and being ahead of the curve.  This isn't Wookies or Jar-Jar (Lucas' closest film to this was THX 1138).  This is a man who is starting to wonder what separates him from the humanoids he is supposed to ""retire"".

About the book vs the movie-- I think Dick's writing can be very uneven  but this novel is first class.  While remaining largely faithful to the book, the movie does simplify things a bit by leaving off some of the book's religious/psychological themes.  There's a religion called Mercerism in the book that is based on empathy, and people have a fetish about owning live animals although mostly only replicants are available.  (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?)  People also frequently use a Mood Organ to give themselves synthetic happiness - in the novel, Decker's  wife is in a haze.",1190246400,20,1370,4.561475409836065

109767,4,0790729628,"1982's ""Blade Runner"" was a highly original and dramatic sci-fi thriller starring Harrison Ford as Decker, a burnt-out bounty hunter living in a high tech 21st Century Los Angeles.  Decker is a so-called blade runner; his job is to hunt down rogue replicants, human-like androids genetically engineered to resemble humans and who sometimes go out of control.  The replicants have exceptional strengths and abilities, but come with a pre-programmed lifespan.  Only an experienced blade runner like Decker can spot one in a crowd.

As the movie opens, Decker is lured out of retirement to track down four renegade replicants, led by Rutger Haur as their ruthless but oddly philosophical leader.  The four rogues attempt to hide in the dark, rainy forest of high-rises that is Los Angeles, a multi-cultural Tokyo on steroids.

Decker will hunt down the rogues one by one.  Each confrontation serves to build sympathy for the replicants, who seem only too human in their desire to live, and for Decker, who has come to loath his job.  Decker will get assistance from Rachel (Sean Young), herself a replicant.  Decker's confrontation with his final opponent is a haunting indication of what a replicant might or might not be capable of.

This edition of ""Blade Runner"" has the ending presented in the original theatrical release, including Decker's explanatory voice-over.  Other editions of this movie, which has spawned its own cult following, have other endings, director cuts, and revisions.  Highly recommended as a ground-breaking example of the sci-fi genre.",1190073600,,1560,5.220883534136546

109770,5,0790729628,"It is great to see Blade Runner finally being the deluxe treatment.  With so many options, it is hard to choose, but this 5-disc Blu-ray edition seems like the most value for your money, but then I guess some will pay twice the price and go for the fancy box that comes with the ultimate colector's edition.

Blade Runner has long deserved better treatment than it has been given over the years.  This is one of the quintessential science fiction movies, based on Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep.  Of course, Blade Runner is a more catchy title and Ridley Scott took a lot of liberties with the story, but he created a masterwork in the process.

Blade Runner paints a distopic vision of the future set in a murky Los Angeles, where Deckard (Harrison Ford) tracks down androids that have escaped from their work colonies.  He meets his match in Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), an android who has taken on many human features and seeks out his maker.  While the movie has many shades of Metropolis and other great science fiction films of the past, it is very much a unique work and has garnered much critical attention over the years.  If one can, one should experience the movie in 70 mm, as it will simply blow you away with its visual effects.

109772,5,0790729628,"Produced in 1982, this film was so far ahead of it's time but filled with enough realism it separated itself from the Star Wars saga that seemed to never end.
The acting alone is about as superb as you'll ever see. The lighting and film effects were enough that it didn't detract from the story of the movie as say a James Bond film does (IMO).
The film was later even used to base a White Zombie song on ""More Human Than Human.
I would have liked to have seen at least one follow up to this film but unfortunately the writer died I believe before the movie was even made? It's also one of the first films ever released on DVD also (The Original Voice over version).
Captivating and star-studded it shows many at the very beginning of their careers.
Not only is this Harrison Ford's best performance but one that will make him endure through the years in Hollywood as a genuinely great actor.

The best part of the movie is it leaves you thinking about some of the pauses and unsaid things in the movie. One that's captured the attention of Bladerunner fans for many years was ""is Harrison Ford's character a Replicant""? I found out the answer to that after watching the movie the second time ;).",1189641600,,1196,4.411764705882353

109776,5,0790729628,"It's maybe the best Sci fi film of all time, maybe number two behind Ridley's other masterpiece, Alien. This film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically manufactured beings, physically identical to adult humans, called replicants are used for dangerous and degrading work in Earth's ""off-world colonies."" Replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody mutiny. Specialist police units -- blade runners -- hunt down and ""retire"" (i.e. kill) escaped replicants on Earth. The plot primarily focuses on a particularly brutal and cunning group of replicants hiding in Los Angeles and a semi-retired blade runner, named Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment. This movie I believe helped to inpire many clone and cyborg type movies like A.I. The story is so ahead of it's time and one of those rare movies that is as good today as it was in 1982 and is almost more relivant. Well fleshed out characters, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is a commando, Leon a soldier and manual laborer, Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) a sex worker retrained as an assassin, and Pris (Daryl Hannah) a ""basic pleasure model."" Bryant also explains that the Nexus-6 model has a four-year lifespan as a failsafe against their developing unstable emotions. Deckard is teamed up with Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and sent to the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the Voight-Kampff test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, Deckard discovers that Tyrell's (Joe Turkel) young secretary Rachael (Sean Young) is an experimental replicant (who believes she is a human) with implanted memories from Tyrell's niece, which provide a cushion for her emotions. I'm a character guy and believe it is imposable to have a great film without many stong multi fasited characters with more that a few layers. Lastly like any great film it is very thought provoking and leaves a lot to the viewer imagination. Many critics and movie goes hated this film for that reason but for the rest of us the compelling question of weather or not Deckard is a replicant is just that thing that makes the movie great. Oh, just so you know...Of course he is, you silly goose!

This is one of those movies that holds up to almost anything made today. the directing, acting, effects, and characters are all spot on. The movie made Rutger Hauer a career as someone to be afraid of.

109777,4,0790729628,"As HOT as I am to get my hands on the 5 disc package. I'm getting a little nervous about the gift that Vangelis gave to this incredible piece of art. Nothing given about a possible separate audio track for his music that he truly gave his heart and his soul to. Nothing listed in the documentaries/ alternate features of BR. Was he interviewed for it? Or was he ever interviewed about his luminous score over the 25 years since the films release? With the multitude of tracks available on dvd I'll be PISSED if the five different versions do not contain a single isolated Vangelis track. His score is equally as legend as the film itself.

I'm a fan of both BR and Vangelis. The fans of the Greek Gods' compositions over the years since BR have had an undying will of force to track down anything remotely related to his blissful score layered in rich atmosphere. Like those mysterious alternate soundtracks that used to be found on Ebay until a few years ago. The Gongo release is the second best one other than the 12 year delayed original version by Vangelis, which was released by Warner music.

Warner Bros. has been proudly proclaiming that they have all the rights issues handled to release this the way the filmmakers wanted it.

Finally the ultimate collection looks to be available very shortly and I find myself just as excited as when I first heard 'the guy who played Han Solo is in a new movie..!' 25 years ago.

I've seen outtake stills and skimmed through the 'making of' books with much curiosity. Learning behind the scene facts about how miserable it was on the set at times and how Harrison Ford had a reputation for not 'liking' the film. This stuff always fascinated me. To think, that the creation of such a creative project could harbor with in it's working process so many negativities and still come out in my mind as perfect was very interesting to me. Time and again, I'd view this movie and see wires lifting up ships and dialog miss cues (that are apparently to be corrected in this latest version)and think that they were done for effect, not by mistake.

Ford is a Philip Marlowe type. If you don't have a strong film background, you may not apprieciate the nuances of the production. It is slow paced, and I welcome this more each year. Every action film released today is wall-to-wall action, with little real character development. Seeing a film like this today is a breath of fresh air. Another plus is the production design, which created a lived-in look to the city. Before this film every sci-fi flick was bright. This film presented an atmosphere of societal's downfall. And the point to the film is that everyone acts like a robot, whether they actually are one or not. Decker probably has the most feelings of anyone, and he is an andoid! Hauer's character's speech at his time of death reinforces the argument that these robots have feelings. He regrets that all his memories will be lost after he dies.

I am in no way related to the Tyrell Corporation that is in ""Blade Runner,"" but since the names are so similar, people are always asking me questions about it.  Consequently, I've become quite an expert on the movie over the years, but I am in no way affiliated with the movie.  And thank Godness!

This movie is a science fiction movie, but there are not any kind of cool laser fights or villainous aliens like you would expect in any movie from the genre.  In fact, the plot revolves around Harrison Ford walking around and whispering in the rain and then...oh wait a minute.  That's all that happens!  Oh, and Darryl Hannah does some backflips that are actually pretty cool.  Other than that, though, this movie fails on most levels and especially I don't like Rutger Howard.

In the future, according to this movie, there are robots and evil people and somehow they are all outsmarting Harrison Ford.  This is very hard to believe, because if you've ever seen ""Presumed Innocent"" or ""Working Girl"" or ""Six Days, Seven Nights,"" then you know that it is very very tricky to outsmart Harrison Ford, especially when he is at the top of his game.

If they decide to make a Blade Runner II (and I'm sure they will) what they should do is give Harrison Ford a funny sidekick like Chris Tucker who says wisecracks while they are tracking down the robots.  Then it would be a charming movie, instead of a depressing rainy mess, which is what this is.  I'm sure by the time we reach the year that this movie takes place (in the future), there probably will be flying cars and such, but I would guess that at the very least we will have figured out a way to make it a little sunnier.  Note to scientists: work on making more sun for the future, and please don't work on Blade Runner II!

Warner Bros played you as fools...and made a killing. Just the way they planned it.
Also most who diss the narration, have had the benefit of viewing it, first, and KNOW the story line. So like sheep , they can now dispense with that version; Again, probably 90% of the situation is a marketing ploy, and many fell for it hook, line and sinker; Show the DC to a stranger to the film and they will lose out on a deeper understanding of what is going on. Like George Lucas, who tried to modernize Star Wars and worse THX 1138, who claims the newest is the best. The new versions of BR are simply a way to get you to buy the Blu Ray all over again. Ive read everything there is to read on the subject, and I read articles, back in 1982, where Scott was asked if the ""narration"" was forced on him. He denied it quite fervently. He is revising his statements, going along with the marketing campaign. I also am wondering if the Blu Ray is really significantly better than the 2007 DVD. With an OPPO 103 player, I'm wonder about the urge to buy even a few things all over again. A-B ing the combo DVD/BR editions of OBLIVION, PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK, etc-I can see little or no difference-comparing them. The 1080 upscaling of the DVD...makes it seem redundant to buy my DVDs all over again. Maybe if you have a HUGE screen it may make a difference-I have a 40"";
Again people are too easily led into the NEW! BETTER! MORE! dumb consumer philosophy. The only disc i will buy over again are discs are favorites transferred before 2005, or SEs that are restored in 4k.

109790,5,0790729628,"Due for re-release in December, this motion picture is one of the finest science fiction films of the 20th century. Part of this is because it projects a future that could be - the earth as a place with a ruined environment populated by people that couldn't or wouldn't make the jump to one of the more habitable off-world colonies. The other part is because the film questions what it means to be human, and explores the possibly unsatisfactory answers you might get if you could, like the replicants, hunt down your maker and ask him Why am I here? Why must my life end? I'll pretty much let Warner's press release do the talking from this point forward. Basically you have your choice of three different sets - 2-disc, 4-disc, and 5-disc. The discs are described as follows:

Disc 1 - Ridley Scott's All-New ""Final Cut"" Version of the film - Restored and remastered with added & extended scenes, added lines, new and cleaner special effects and all new 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio. Also included is commentary by Ridley Scott and a host of others that worked behind the camera.

Disc 2 - Documentary - Dangerous Days: Making of Blade Runner - A feature-length documentary revealing all the elements that shaped this cinema landmark. Cast, crew, critics and colleagues give a behind-the-scenes, in-depth look at the film from its literary roots and inception through casting, production, visuals and special effects to its legacy.

Disc 3 - 1982 Theatrical Version - The original that contains Deckard's narration and has Deckard and Rachel's (Sean Young) ""happy ending"" escape scene.

1982 International Version - Also used on U.S. home video, laserdisc and cable releases up to 1992. This version is not rated, and contains some extended action scenes in contrast to the Theatrical Version.

1992 Director's Cut - Omits Deckard's voiceover narration and removes the ""happy ending"" finale. It adds the famous ""unicorn"" sequence, a vision that Deckard has which suggests that he, too, may be a replicant.

Disc 4 - BONUS Disc ""Enhancement Archive"" - Eight featurettes, image galleries, radio interview with the author, and screen tests for the part of Rachel.

Disc 5 - Workprint Version - This rare version of the film is considered by some to be the most radically different of all the Blade Runner cuts. It includes an altered opening scene, no Deckard narration until the final scenes, no ""unicorn"" sequence, no Deckard/Rachel ""happy ending,"" altered lines between Rutger Hauer and his creator Tyrell (Joe Turkell), alternate music and much more.

Also included is commentary by Paul M. Sammon, author of Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner and a featurette - ""All Our Variant Futures: From Workprint to Final Cut"".

2 Disc Edition : Discs 1-2
4 Disc Edition : Discs 1-4
5 Disc Edition : Discs 1-5

The downside of this 2-disc version is that you are only getting the Final Cut version of the film and the documentary disc. You won't get the bonus disc of featurettes, the disc of past releases, and the workprint version of the film. The upside is that the 5-disc version of the film has some expensive packaging and promotional material included that seems to really raise the price of the entire package.",1185580800,738,3213,4.878899082568807

It would be nice if they'd just put out the disks without the other stuff.  (2) The only way to get any of the older versions is in either the 4-disk or 5-disk sets.  It would be nice if they made the older versions (basically disk 3) available separately for those who only want one of the older cuts.",1185494400,7,597,4.219298245614035

Some parts were confusing, which is why I want to see the original version, with the voice over explanations, but I don't mind ambiguity in films. This is why I enjoyed the ending so much. Will Decker ""retire"" Rachel, or will he help her escape? I can't wait until this new 5 disc release comes out! Finally, fans here at the States can have the Theater Version on DVD!

Among changes: A longer ""unicorn"" scene. During the commentary, Scott explains that it's pivotal because the symbolism re-enforces Scott's thinking that Deckard (Harrison Ford) is not human, but a replicant. Plus: enhanced special effects, a new surround soundtrack. Bonuses include a new making-of documentary.

Shoot, if they'd seen the original version first on my laserdisc player with the narrated explanations, then there'd be no questions. I liked the first version better, including the alternate ending. I rate this new 4 disc releaase on RUMORS, but they seem to be SOLID RUMORs, and as I stated, I own both versions. In some ways Laserdiscs are better than DVDs.

The ceaseless rain, 2019 LA smog, gloom, hyper-stimulation, and overcrowding were depressing; and I didn't care much whether Ford found the ""Replicants"" or not. The Hollywood formula guaranteed he would, with suitable travail. The film's special visual effects were well done for the time, and added to my depression. I wondered if the directors / produceers meant this to be a visual morality play about our current overpopulation / media overstimulation / and ecological shifts in California. If so, it didn't make much impression on our society.

Profits over people, and intelligent lifeforms as commodities for our whims. While not always sticking to the focus of the replicants as ""emerging humans"" --not unlike children learning the mores of social interaction-- Blade Runner soars for its examination of the question, ""Once we can create life on the human level, what seperates us from them? Why do we deserve to live, given that the replicants ultimately want to understand what it is to be human?"" This film posits serious questions and morals that are more relevant today than ever, now that we are at the dawn of the age of biotechnology.""

Then a few years ago I saw the theatrical release of BR and I thought it better (mostly) and I was always disappointed that a DVD version of the theatrical release hadn't ever materialise. But now this anniversary edition coming soon (hopefully) I can finally get every known version of the movie (maybe): The theatrical release; the work print; the director's ""amendment"" and now an actual director's cut- Riddley Scott's actual vision to what BR should have been.
But these are all rumours and speculations. I just want to is when is the going to be released! I'm thinking November 19 or something like that.",1181779200,,765,4.632352941176471
109803,2,0790729628,"First off, let me say that this movie is one of my all-time favorites. I was only 11 when I first saw it in theaters and I didn't quite ""get it"" at the time.

In my late teens, I revisited the movie again when it ran on cable and I was able to copy it onto video tape. With my slightly better educated teenage mind, I finally ""got it"". I had come to the conclusion that Blade Runner was a cinematic masterpiece.

The film was perfectly cast (many of the actors were relatively unkown at the time), the special effects were amazing (even rivaling some of today's effects standards), the costumes, sets, and lighting were extraordinary, the music (by Vangelis) was gorgeous and the cinematography was breathtaking.

So, why only 2 stars?

First off, the DVD transfer is horrible. It's not much better than the VHS copy I have. I know that the film was digitally remastered and re-released in late 2006, but I simply refused to buy it again because of my second point:

This is the director's cut. Call me crazy, but I much prefer the original theatrical version. I LIKED Ford's voice-over narraration. It reminded me of the classic detective serials. Crossing that over to the sci-fi genre was a brilliant move in my opinion.

The director's cut actually took scenes OUT (with the exception of Deckard's dream which gave a totally new interpretation of whether or not he was a replicant). Usually, a director's cut is LONGER and includes MORE scenes. Why go to all of the trouble to re-release a film if you're going to make it shorter and take scenes out? This was especially hard for me to take when Deckard's dream sequence replaced the scene where he is half-drunk and plinking away on the piano and we hear an alternate version of the beautiful ""love theme"". To me, that was an amazing scene and for some reason, Ridley Scott felt that he had to change or eliminate it.

Thirdly, the DVD contains no extras to speak of.

Rumors have been floating around for years that a definitive ""final cut"" of Blade Runner was to be released on DVD with a lot of extras and bonus features, including the original theatrical version, the director's cut and the final cut of the film. Due to legal problems and disputes, this never materialized.

Luckily, I found this movie for $2.50 in the bargain bin at a local store. Otherwise, I would not have paid any real money to own this movie, which is a real shame.

This film is a classic and deserves MUCH better treatment. Hopefully, 2007 (Blade Runner's 25th birthday) will prove to be the year that this definitve edition comes to fruition. If and when it does, I will gladly shell out my hard-earned money to own it.

109804,2,0790729628,"I heard the ""suits"" at Warner made Scott add the voice over because they thought the movie's plot was too vague without it, looks like they were right. But this movie has other weaknesses. First the FX which set the mood has lost much of its power to impress, granted that can't be helped, but its still a fact. The not so subtle Japan bashing, from a time when Japan was seen as our #1 threat, seems as corny today as a Red Scare movie from the `50s. Last the endless philosophizing by beings, that don't exist, and probably never will, on the subject of ""are skin jobs human"". Maybe expecting a movie to have the same impact 25 years later is unrealistic, or maybe it was based on once trendy now pass&eacute; ideas.",1180569600,,718,4.365671641791045

109807,5,0790729628,"All the press about this DVD release is that it's going to include four different versions of the film: the original 1982 U.S. theater release, the original international release (which contained a little more violence, basically; it's been available on VHS before), the 1992 director's cut, and then the new ""definitive"" Ridley Scott cut with updated special effects and everything supposedly just the way Scott wants it.

I'm starting to get concerned about the release though.  The original press releases about this DVD said that the director's cut would get a limited reissue in late 2006 (which did happen), then the new definitive cut would get a brief theatrical release this year before hitting DVD soon after.  That was all said last year.  I haven't seen a thing about a theatrical release or a DVD release for this year.  Anyone heard anything new?

For the record, I'm a fan of all the versions and flipped over the 1982 theatrical release, but I prefer the director's cut.  I much prefer the ambiguous ending, and the unicorn scene making you wonder about Deckard's character.  After seeing the director's cut, I felt that the original narration, in particular over Batty's death scene, made me feel like the studio believed I wouldn't understand the movie otherwise.  Give me some credit, studio!

And the original's ending always did feel like a cop-out to me to make the audience feel happy.  Remember that the studio took the film from Scott and tacked on that ending, using extra footage from Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining""!  It wasn't fair, when you hadn't seen a clear sky the entire film, to tack beautiful scenery on at the end.  That took away from everything you'd seen before about enticing people to leave Earth for the Offworld colonies.  Why leave Earth, or even live in the city, when there was still scenery like that to run to?  I thought the ending of the director's cut was much better, leaving it all up to the viewer.

For me, all my friends and other Blade Runner Fans I have talked over the years, there is something missing......Deckard's wonderful narrative throughout the movie.......which we love so much!

The Director's Cut is probably great for people who have never watched the film before. However, it's time that loyal fans like myself are given a chance after 25 years, to be able to watch a FULL RE-MASTERED DVD version of the Original Blade Runner film. Then we will be waiting for the release of a Blu-Ray/HD version......ha, ha.

Whatever the controversy over the Original/Director's cut, it has nothing to do with Blade Runner Fans. So why are the Original Fans still waiting?

Some find the narration cheesy and distracting, but for me it is what makes the film different and unique amongst others of the genre.  So my rating would be 5 stars for the original release and 3.5 stars for the later versions.  I'm glad they included the original film in this set, though it would be nice if there were a single-release DVD of it as well.  To spend so much for a five-disc set in order to get a high-quality copy of the first version is a shame.

I like Deckard's narrative throughout the movie, sometimes referred to as Film Noir, and the scene of him and the girl flying away to Canada with some great scenery and music at the end. It seemed a little less dark with a bit more hope at the conclusion. I will snap this up in a heartbeat if this is the theater release. If it is another directors cut only release I will tell them to bite me. If you like the Director's cut that is fine, I'm glad you have what you want. Don't criticize us if we want something that was taken from us. If you have seen a movie in the theater and then seen it changed to something less, I can't believe you wouldn't want to have the full version. When George Lucas changed the original ""Star Wars"" it wasn't to take something away, but to add some special effects that he couldn't do originally. But I have to agree with a comment I got, they are still entitled to the original version as well. In the Blade Runner director's cut, dialogue and a scene are removed. No additions, just subtractions. So stop being critical of my review if I want the whole enchilada. By the way why don't we let the book critics weigh in on ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" while we're at it. I'm sure they will tell you neither movie version was like the book. Ask me if I care it wasn't the same as the book. I read to folks, but if I hold my breath till the movie = book, I will be dead much longer than the oldest pharoah has been.

Three comments:

One person pointed out that Ridley Scott was not responsible for the Director's Cut. You notice I never mentioned him in my review. I am aware the studio was behind it.

A couple others pointed out they like the original ""Star Wars"", so do I, and I have to agree we are still entitled to the original version as well. That is kind of my whole argument here, everyone should be entitled to the original theater releases.

Another person asked, ""Why are we posting reviews already?"". Fair question, now go look at reviews I posted at ""Shoot to Kill"", ""The Enemy Below"", ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", et cetera. I posted them pre-release of DVDs to make sure there was a release. Do you think studios ignore these reviews? They do not. I regularly get invitations to write reviews at other sites and have spoken to some of the studios about planned releases. So I want to thank all the people posting reviews and voting here, it does make a difference.

You folks complaining about our pre-reviews need to go work with the kids that like to brag about how they beat a game or quest by themsleves instead of giving useful information on where it was or how to beat it in reviews and forums all over the internet. Your lack of interest in pre-reviews serves no positive input to those of us that are interested to find out what we can about this upcoming release. I hope you realize when I first wrote this review it was but a dream to get the original release. All there was is a fill in your e-mail and we will let you know if and when this will come out on DVD. The name at that time was Blade Runner Definitive Release. There were no images here and certainly no details. So I hope that helps to show that the interest people took in this area I am sure played at least some part in making it happen. I want to thank all those that posted information as it became available for those of us that think pre-reviews are important. Saying you don't like pre-reviews is like saying, don't tell me that car is going to hit me. I don't want to know about the possible future. If that's the way you feel, why are you posting about a SciFi movie? As for those claiming these really aren't reviews, you will note the Amazon link says ""Write Review"", I think they know what they are even if you don't.",1178755200,67,4544,4.570552147239264
109813,5,0790729628,"43 yo No qualifications whatsoever as movie critic

This is one of my favorite films. I write recalling the first time I viewed it, somewhere in the mid 80's while in the university. The images and hidden messages is something that will captivate you and encourage always to look for some detail that may have been overlooked (trust me this is a movie to be seen)....fantastic images.. and yes.. Vangelis does the soundtrack...atmospheric setting

To me geniality of the movie lies in the fact of telling a tragic tell of a group of ""humanoids""- improved biological replicas designed to have amazing physical powers- they were created to do chores and jobs such as soldiers, inter-stellar explorers and ""pleasure models"". Replicas have one limitation by design, they cannot live more than 4 years.

The replicas are  manufactured by a supercorporation, whose CEO is a genious who still lives in earth (a place mostly inhabited by the degenerate, outcasts and unfit to pass the migration criteria for interplanetary travel).. a group of rebelious replicas want a to meet with their Creator and asks for more life, a request that this mortal god cannot concede... Harrison Ford is a retired ""skin remover"" - that is , a policeman in charge of removing replicas- that is forced back to his former job to help take the group of replicas or ""become little people"". He is a antiheroe we can quickly relate to.. the world is now a babelistic mixture of tongues, so we hear chinese, spanish and english words as a background of street pappiamento. No I am not going to spoil it for you.

At least the replicas have the chance to find their creator- they are moved by our same existencialistic motives, but they are not given the paths of faith to find the answers. What do they want? I guess the same as everyone else, they just want a fair share of life- We have created new slaves whose notion of equality is just to live longer or at least as much as we do.

I wonder what would I do if I found my maker and could openly ask for more life, and find out he has limitations on that? A god with limitations, if we could forget the damn Aristotelic and Scholastic tradition of the contradiction of such a term, and we indeed find a god- made into our same image- and listen to his benevolent amorous advice and consolation- but realice that- ""Yes Virginia (I am so sorry to say)- there is no santa claus""-

I forgot where I read it, was it Nietche, was it Schopenhauer?, oh well, it goes like this "" truth can only belong to those who can bear it""

In spanish sound better ""La verdad es de quien la pueda soportar""

[...], is an allegory that teaches us something about the nature of our mortality. It asks the questions we all ask: ""Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got?"" I know it asks these exact questions because the character of ex-cop Deckard tells us so exactly in the voiceover-laden theatrical version of the film.

In spite of the persistent flaw of the VO's, this film goes on my list of top 15 favorites nonetheless. It is a beautiful film, moody, poetic and yet suspenseful. It is an intensely human drama set in a dark and rainy future where genetically engineered humans are relinquished to roles of servitude. Disenfranchised, they are built and programmed to be prostitutes, laborers, soldiers or other grunts.  All the jobs ""real"" humans either can't or won't do are the rice bowls for this new generation of slaves called ""replicants"". Programmed into them is a biological clock that shortens their life span, making them easier to manage and very expendable. The knowledge of their shortened life span sends a small group of replicants on a quest...oh, hell, I'm telling you the storyline -- see the movie for that...  One of the many memorable things about this film is the relationship between Deckard and Rachael, a replicant so well made and supplied with memories so complete she has no idea she's one of them.

Deckard's job is to terminate errant, runaway replicants, and when he forms a relationship with Rachael, his ambivalence, already to the point of impairing his professional judgment, is made worse. This sets the stage for the powerful transformation of Deckard later in the film, making his repentance about killing who he now perceives as real people, replicants or not, all the more moving. The end of the film has one of the most beautiful, hanky-dabbing cinematic sequences I've ever seen when Rutger Hauer as the replicant Roy Batty recites in his moment of death: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe - troop ships on fire off the..."" Crud. I used to have that especially poetic passage memorized, but I'm afraid I'll just butcher it now.

Strong characterizations, fascinating themes, great special effects and brilliant art direction make this one of the best SF dramas ever made. Replicants Pris and Rachael are wonderfully portrayed by Darryl Hannah and Sean Young, and Harrison Ford is spot on as the morally tortured blade runner, Deckard. The movie is filled with characters and concepts you just won't forget. If you can, see the director's cut without the VO's. It's a much better version of the film and makes one wonder why the VO's were used in the first place.",1177459200,6,2740,4.871244635193133
109815,5,0790729628,"I want the original and the directors cut and won't settle for less. I saw the original in the theater more than once. No other movie besides ""Star Wars"" impressed me so much. This movie is in the top 5 of all time great SciFi movies. No other movie will do a better job of immersing you in a future world than Ridley Scott did here. Imagine how impressive it was in the theater over twenty-five years ago if it can do that even today. It is an astounding vision of the future. When it comes to robot movies I will take this over ""I, Robot"" any day. This movie showed how good of actors that Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer could be. Both have done alot since, but not necessarily better. This was probably Hauer's best film, but I do like ""Ladyhawke"" quite a bit. Ford, well he has several good ones, ""The Fugitive"" is hard to top and I enjoy him in ""Star Wars"", but this is still my favorite of all he has done. Any fan of SciFi must have this in their collection. This almost seems like a cop drama crossed with a SciFi movie. The sets, lighting, and camera work are amazing and will make you feel you are living in the future. This one is a keeper that you will want on DVD. I wish Ridley Scott would put Isaac Asimov's Foundation series into movies. If it was half as good as what he did with Blade Runner I'm sure it would be breath taking.",1176854400,7,1345,4.157088122605364
109816,5,0790729628,"This is one of my favorite movies ever, and certainly the best film Harrison Ford was ever involved with. Ditto Rutger Hauer. No, on second thought I'd like to edit that to read 'ESPECIALLY Rutger Hauer.'

""Say there, Roger Ramjet!"" you're probably thinking. ""What kind of banana oil are you peddlin', bucaroo? Cuz you're in the wrong shop if you're shoppin' fer a sucker!"" Allow me to explain. Everything about this movie worked. The sets, the cast, the music--everything. This film looks as fresh and evocative as it did when it first aired in the early 80s, and easily gets my vote for 'Most Atmospheric Movie Ever Award'. I can't think of another film that drags you so quickly into it's Reality with the exception of  Star Wars, whose opening scenes gave the audience it's first glimpse at the overwhelming might of the Empire.

I think everyone takes something a little different from Blade Runner. For some it may be a question as to what it is that truly makes us Human, others may see it as a Space Opera romance, others still may find it a chilling warning on current societal trends. The point is that it stimulates thought in almost everyone who sees it, and I find that a wonderful quality given the pre-digested pap we tend to get nowadays. I don't know a great deal about Phillip K. Dick's personal life. He strikes me as being a bit paranoid with an unhealthy fear of the passage of time, but for all I know to the contrary he may have been frequently found with a lamp shade on his head, entertaining the neighbors with comic songs and tap dancing. Hard to say, but either way the man had a tremendous imagination, and this story is among his best.

Blade Runner can be clinically shown to be the only legitimate example in history of a film that is slightly better than the book it was based on. I give Ridley Scott the credit for that; it was the director who created this convincingly sinister alien landscape for us. I never tire of this movie, and seem to catch new and quirky details each time I see it. The dialogue is wonderfully surreal in parts, and it's a treasure trove of quotable lines for you and like-minded friends.

The only criticism I could bring would be on the version available on DVD. I did not see Blade Runner in a theatre; my introduction to this classic came by way of the ancient VHS tape. That version contained the commercially released voice-over by Harrison Ford, deleted and seemingly unavailable on any DVD version I can find. I may be in a very small minority here, but I think it was a terrible mistake to cut the VO. Not only did it splash an indispensable aura of Noir chic over the landscape, it was a handy tool for rendering a complex plot into a form more easily grasped by the casual viewer. I sincerely hope that one day a proper DVD will be made available featuring both versions, theatrical release and Directors' Cut. Please allow your fans to also enjoy it in the form they remember it, Mr. Scott!",1176163200,7,2963,4.51024208566108

109818,5,0790729628,"BladerunnerIt's a toss up for the best Sci fi film of all times.  The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically manufactured beings, physically identical to adult humans, called replicants are used for dangerous and degrading work in Earth's ""off-world colonies."" Replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody mutiny. Specialist police units -- blade runners -- hunt down and ""retire"" (i.e. kill) escaped replicants on Earth. The plot primarily focuses on a particularly brutal and cunning group of replicants hiding in Los Angeles and a semi-retired blade runner, named Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment. This movie I believe helped to inpire many clone and cyborg type movies like A.I. The story is so ahead of it's time and one of those rare movies that is as good today as it was in 1982 and is almost more relivant. Well fleshed out characters, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is a commando, Leon a soldier and manual laborer, Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) a sex worker retrained as an assassin, and Pris (Daryl Hannah) a ""basic pleasure model."" Bryant also explains that the Nexus-6 model has a four-year lifespan as a failsafe against their developing unstable emotions. Deckard is teamed up with Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and sent to the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the Voight-Kampff test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, Deckard discovers that Tyrell's (Joe Turkel) young secretary Rachael (Sean Young) is an experimental replicant (who believes she is a human) with implanted memories from Tyrell's niece, which provide a cushion for her emotions. I'm a character guy and believe it is imposable to have a great film without many stong multi fasited characters with more that a few layers. Lastly like any great film it is very thought provoking and leaves a lot to the viewer imagination. Many critics and movie goes hated this film for that reason but for the rest of us the compelling question of weather or not Deckard is a replicant is just that thing that makes the movie great. Oh, just so you know...Of course he is, you silly goose!

This is one of those movies that holds up to almost anything made today.  the directing, acting effects, and characters are all spot on.  The movie made Rutger Hauer a career as someone to be afraid of.",1175040000,3,2323,4.888324873096447
109819,5,0790729628,"Bladerunner is a paradox in that: the older it gets the fresher it looks. When first released in 1982 it's public reception was luke warm to say the least. Over time, fuelled by it's video and subsequent DVD release, an army of Bladerunner fans have emerged to fight its corner. Some films achieve cult status on a whim and question marks continue to hang over their quality. With Bladerunner this is certainly not the case.

Set in 21st century Los Angeles, Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a policeman from an elite unit (Bladerunners) with the remit to hunt down hunanoid robots (Replicants) who attempt to integrate into human society. When several replicants come to earth aiming to infiltrate the company that made them in a bid to extend their lifespan, Deckard is sent to track them down.

This cut removes the voice over and upbeat ending prevelent in the original 1982 cinema release and as such the film morphs into a darker and more claustrophobic entity. This enhances Doug Trumball's (2001, Close Encounters of the Third Kind) stunning special effects which easily match any of the CGI work on show today. And Hampton Fancher and David Peoples have crafted a script which forever questions the ethics of creating sentient beings but not allowing for the growth of autonomy or rights.

  The only reason I care about this movie at all is because I grew up with the original theatrical release, and it had a profund effect on me.

  This movie is more than just sci-fi, the original voice over provides volumes of insight into the Deckard character. It sucks you into his world and leaves you breathless with the rooftop climax. As a young man, I was inspired by the poetry of Rutger Hauers death scene.

To remove the narration is unbelievable to me. Especially that last moment on the rooftop, C'mon - That gave me chills!!

While it may be true that we can wait until the new versions come out in 2007, that does not diminish the quality and beauty of this release.

This version of the film does clarify a few mysteries by confirming the hypothesis that Ford's character is a replicant by inserting the unicorn scene.  Although the deletion of the Mary character is still subconsiously obvious.  I found that for some reason, the clues that Deckard uses to find one replicant after another were more obvious and easier to follow in this version, perhaps just because of the remastering, or possibly because one is less dependent on being bridled by the voice overs, and pays more attention to the movie.

To the reviews that find the film more challenging: This version is less ""Accessible"" since it loses the voice overs that provide cartoonish explanation. And it is worth saying that Blade Runner is not an action movie for pulp sci-fi fans.  It is a heroic, tragic, deep, meaningful, literate essay on individualism, memory, life, technology, and what it means to be mortal. It is a modern day Greek tragedy.  It is a movie to be personally witnessed and contemplated. It is not a Saturday afternoon popcorn venue for friends looking for reprieve from the work week.

My review is short for two reasons: 1) Blade Runner is one great movie, despite the fact that this Director's Edition might not be your cup of tea. After all, the original - uncut - version is better because of (amongst other reasons or opinions) the consistency in the storyline. Nevertheless, this version is one for the people that have a weak spot for some movie titles and want a complete collection. 2) The great image quality, no doubt about that. It blasts any earlier version away and that makes it worth the price.

I would have rated this new DVD version five stars if the same could be said of the sound quality, but unfortunately, it only has 2 channel sound.

109844,5,0790729628,"In many ways, Ridley Scott's films remind me of Brian de Palma's: many people consider him a filmmaking icon, a notable director among the many many other ones making good or bad films. Sure de Palma has his Scarface and his Untouchables but don't forget he also had the forgettable Snake Eyes and Mission to Mars. Ridley Scott meanwhile has Alien and Gladiator(overrated personally) but he does have White Squall and 1692 but chalk Blade Runner up in his more memorable films has its probably one of the better made sci-fi films of the 80's.

It's 2017 and mankind has developed Replicants, humanoids who look very similar to humans and used for degrading work. After they decide to revolt, humans start making specialists - blade runners - to ""retire"" the replicants, in other words, kill. They bring in Deckard, a retired blade runner, to track down replicants who recently escaped all the while falling in love with one.

A lot of futuristic films seem to be very ambitious where the technology reaches a point where anything's possible. Interstellar travel, flying cars, sophisticated ID systems and holographs are very present in these kind of films but oddly, Blade Runner doesn't have as much. While it does have some scenes involving flying cars going over neon-lit cities and a woman's face on a building, when we're on ground level the technology isn't as apparent. It helps the film feel real and plausible without looking too ambitious for its own good.

It's interesting to note that although the film is considered a sci-fi film, it's kind of light on action scenes. It's not that big of a deal but when you look at the main cover art, Deckard with gun in hand, but people thinking this is going to be a slam-bang action film by Ridley Scott might be disappointed. I was surely expecting it but seeing the film, as good as it was, I was like ""wow, not a lot of fast parts"". Then again, Alien had deliberate pacing so I guess it's to be expected.

For those of you wondering, this isn't the super deluxe edition where we have different versions of the film(that's in 2007), so with this one we only get the remastered version of the film with a better transfer. So if you want to replace your crappy original director's cut version with horrible main menu and crappy transfer, go ahead but if you want more bang for your 30 to 40$ whatever it will be come up to, wait till 2007.",1158278400,,2392,4.634433962264151

If you look at the technical section you'll find that although encoded for Dolby digital the audio is still only the original 2 channel stereo and only contains left-right tracks. This movie cries out for an audio remastering to at least 5.1 discreet. I can't vouch for the supposed transfer improvement since I already on the previous director's cut and don't need another one. If this is released in HD (whatever the format) without the addition of an audio remix it would be a travesty. And if anyone involved with the movie ever reads this stuff (doubtful)... When the audio does get remix please no hack jobs. Upgrading to 5.1 is great only if the time is taken and the money spent to do it right. Better no 5.1 than one that sounds like it doesn't go with the movie.,1157846400,6,834,4.529801324503311
109848,5,0790729628,"This 1982 film loosely based on Phillip K. Dick's novella, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", hit the theatre's running, hailing international critical acclaim, and now, twenty-four years later, has become a science fiction cult classic.

The time is 2019, and the city in which the story is told, is dark and smog-ridden, where acid rain pours down constantly. Decker (Harrison Ford) is a Blade Runner, a police officer or bounty hunter whose job it is to capture renegade replicants, human-like robots who have gone bad. The only way blade runner's can determine whether a suspect is human or replicant, is a series of unrelated questions, while the subject's eye is examined, measuring pupil movement.

Rutger Hauer plays the leader of a group of escaped replicant's that are on the run. Hauer's performance in this film is mesmerising, and in my opinion, the greatest performance of his film career.

The central question the film and book proposes is what constitutes being human?

Hauer's character is a dangerous and extremely intelligent replicant. His mission is to find his creator and murder him, the inventor of replicants. He displays no mercy in this highly charged scene where they finally meet. However, in the end, this replicant displays mercy and even compassion. These so-called machines do in fact have a conscience, show kindness and even real love; ironically, the attributes and virtues that many ""humans"" lack in many ways.

In terms of production value, this film, every scene in fact, was created with care and adept skill down to every detail - an atmospheric work of virtual genius.

There are many films that one will view that might have made an impression at the time but will soon be forgotten. Blade Runner is a must to have in one's DVD library because it can be viewed hundreds of times and continue to impress.

One of the great film's of the twentieth century.",1157760000,7,1902,4.943573667711599

Most of the special effects shots contain HUGE amounts of video noise and/or graininess. I found this so distracting that I couldn't enjoy the wonderful visuals -- especially the awesome opening of the movie.

I feel misled by the ""professional"" reviews of this release on DVD sites, which generally praise the transfer and don't mention the above problems. I wish I'd waited until next year's Final Cut, which I'm hoping will clean up the special effects shots.",1157587200,13,615,5.029411764705882

There can be no doubt that it's a huge improvement over what we've had before. The sound seems clearer too although I hope there is a 5.1 mix added to the ultimate release next year.

For anyone who doesn't know, Ridley Scott is preparing a ""Final Cut"" of the film that's going to be shown in theaters next year prior to the release of the big Blade Runner boxed set. That release is likely to appear on HD-DVD/Blu Ray as well.

I'm in the minority, but I prefer the theatrical release of the film to the version presented here. For the theatrical release, the studio insisted on a narration by Harrison Ford to explain the film to audiences. I find that this director's cut has a lot of unnatural silences where the narration used to be and for me, that throws the pacing of the film off. I've heard that Ridley's final cut will include some of the narration. That could very well be the best version of this film yet.

We'll know in 2007.

Otherwise, it is still a great remaster that shows BR at it's best for now and makes the movie have that much more eyecandy. It's alot less washed out and more defined and colorful. Also, the new anamorphic aspect ratio is a great addition.

I'm not going to go on and on about the movie because all of you Blade Runner fans out there know what's up.  My main reason for writing this review was to dicuss the transfer.

The transfer is definitely better than the one you are all used to.  I'm pretty picky and to be honest, i was not 100% impressed.  I guess since it took so long I was expecting more.  From the beginning you can spot all that grain and noise we are all used to.  i guess i was just expecting a tranfer like Alien or Apocalypse now.  The picture is definitely clearer and the colors are more vibrant.  I have a feeling that they could have done a little bit better though.

109855,5,0790729628,"Well... here's the deal...

Blade Runner stands as one of those films whose editting and final cut were always a subject for debate. As you may know there are two known cuts of this film: the original theatrical version (shunned by many who claimed it was a producer's cut who did not believe in Scott's true vision) and the director's cut (which is not really the director's cut... it is more a screenplay's cut... with some changes who merely unmade some of the things the producers did on the previous cut).

It is this second version that you will find here (while the first version is no longer available) with a face lift... a new transfer... better sound... and that's it.

In one way, this version is badly needed because all the previous Blade Runner DVD incarnations come from the first years of DVD - when you didn't even have a decent menu. And since the DVD technology has evolved a lot since then... why not a new version of Blade Runner, right?

But.......

The mystique surrounding Blade Runner says that director Ridley Scott never REALLY got HIS REAL version of this film. And more... A such an important and much loved film like this should have lots of extras to bring a new light to a film that is so fundamental and trendsetting.

And it seems that after 25 years, all the legal problems preventing all this from happenning were really sorted out between the film's former producers who battled for years for the film's rights.

And now, with all problems solved, we know that in 2007, we'll have that multi-disc version all the fans always dreamt of.

SO, THE DEAL IS... IF YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT THIS VERSION, BUY THIS EDITION. The good thing is you won't even go through those stupid snap cases anymore. Even if you already have it, the better image and sound on this release will certainly make up for it.

BUT IF YOU CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING LESS THAT THE WHOLE MULTI-DISC EDITION COMPRISING ALL THE VERSIONS AND TONS OF EXTRAS... forget about this version and wait a few months for the longer, bigger, more complete, celebratory, multi versioned, multi disc set that will give you the FULL BLADE RUNNER deal.

It will cost more, naturally, but we've been saving money for it since our childhood, right? ;-)

I'm a big fan. So I'll wait. This version is a quick, just and much needed repairment: a great new transfer (with no extras) for those who just want the film. An entry level I'd say. And I think it is good that Warner Home Video has this version for those who just want the film - at bargain price.

109859,4,0790729628,"Blade Runner, based on the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep? by Philip K. Dick, is a mixture of many things.  First off the novel was written by one of the genuine visionaries of our time, not just science fiction as much as a future of where mankind might be going.  Then it was turned into a movie directed by Ridley Scott (Alien) who had his own vision and ideas to add to the mix.  Then you add such greats as Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Edward James Olmos who really made their characters shine.  Sprinkle in a future which is both amazingly bright and nightmarishly dark, and poof, you have Blade Runner.

Is it about a dark future?  Is it about a realistic future?  Is it about slavery?  Is it about the dangers of DNA?  It depends on how you look at it.

While my case said there were production notes these turned out just to be a few screens about the crew and not worth very much.  Also, it turned out to be one of those double sided discs, which while giving you the choice to pick either wide-screen or standard, seems to be a waste of space.  Who wants standard when you can have wide-screen?",1154217600,4,1130,4.303317535545023
109860,4,0790729628,"In the not-too distant future, replicants - nearly perfect organic-robotic machines - are difficult to distinguish from ordinary humans. A crew of 6 of these creatures has escaped from exile and has returned to Earth. Deckard, a retired replicant hunter, or Bladerunner, is called back to duty to ""retire"" them.

There is a lot of spooky weirdness about the setting of the movie. The locale seems to be an amalgam of New York City, Tokyo and Hong Kong, with lots of enormous neon billboards high on buildings, and lots of hustle-bustle on the streets below. Police cruise the city in aircars, and the citizens scurry, mole-like, through the maze of buildings and streets below. The musical score is haunting and disturbing, and frequently got on my nerves, yet was creepily appropriate for the film.

Sets aside, the plot revolved around Decker's apparent distaste for his work. It's not apparent from the film why this might been, but it might revolve around issues of how similar the replicant are to humans. Are they menaces to terrestrial peace and security? Like humans, are they autonomous beings desperately trying to steal another day of life? Can they love and be loved? Having raised these questions, the film doesn't try hard to address them, and the last half of the movie is an extended, dull and preposterous cat-and-mouse game between Decker and the replicants, led by the incredible Rutger Hauer.

Shortcomings aside, Bladerunner was worth seeing, just for the sets and the discussions it inspires. How will humans react when their machines are fundamentally indistinguishable from -- even superior to -- their creators? The movie's writing fails to engage this situation adequately, but the visuals make up for this lack.

For my money, the director's cut is superior to the original. The occasional narration in the original was jarring puerile and almost laughable, adding little to the understanding of the movie. Better to do without it and to risk possible confusion. Really neat, with reservations.",1154044800,,2021,5.096676737160121

Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner (a cop who hunts Replicants) who, while hunting 4 violents Replicants, falls in love with a new model Replicant played by Sean Young.

Director Ridlet Scott does a wonderful job of delivering to viewers a new and fantastic future. Twenty years later, Blade Runner still shines and looks fresh.

The acting is Blade Runner was wonderful, as could be expected. Harrison Ford, Edward James Olmos, and William Sanderson all put in brilliant performances, with the rest fo the cast putting in workman efforts as well.

Possible spoiler below...

Some may not like Blade Runner because of an ambiguous ending; an ending that leaves us wondering about a unicorn, and if it was a false memory. My main frustration with the ending is that I wanted the story to continue.

Another frustration I had with the film was the end of the fight sequence between Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford. The reasons for Rutger not killing Ford were not fleshed out enough for my taste. If Ford was a Replicant, and I haven't read the book, it might have make some sense that Hauer spared Ford's life. Still, Ford killed many replicants, and it wasn't very believable that Hauer didn't kill him. The movie fails the viewer in this sense.

Despite the flaws I loved Blade Runner, and will most likely purchase it on DVD and watch it again and again. It has too much good going for it to be called anything less than a great film.

The only reason I give it 4 stars, and not 5, is because of the endless product placement scenes which begin to distract from the movie. We are flashed billboards and signs for Coca Cola, Atari, Budweiser, RCA, TDK, Bulova, and more. After the first scene with an advertisement, they get old and distracting fast. A movie of this caliber is weakened by product placement. I was constantly being pulled from my immersion in the movie back into reality, and that is a serious flaw.

Despite this, please see Blade Runner. It is great, and a classic.

109865,3,0790729628,"BLADE RUNNER has been a film that has suffered over the years. Misinterpreted and critically attacked at the time of its initial release, it cultivated something of a cult following throughout the 1980s, which culminated in a complete critical about turn when the Directors Cut emerged in 1992. Opinion on the film is now the polar opposite to what it was in the early 1980's. Lauded by academics and film students, many books and articles have dissected the film from all angles, but mostly as the ultimate embodiment of a post-modern culture. The problem with this, is that a lot BLADE RUNNER'S magic has been lost in reams and reams of literature that have reduced the film to an academic exercise in cultural studies.

 I think too be fair BLADE RUNNER  exists in between these two polar oppositions. It is neither the masterpiece so many claim it too be, nor the unmitigated disaster many critics thought on its original release. Where BLADE RUNNER really succeeds is in its grimy and grungy realisation of a future Los Angeles, a space overrun by people of all ethnic groups, a frightening dystopia where one is not even sure if the person next to you in the crowded street is human. This is a vision of the future that Kubrick had hinted at in 2001, one totally reliant on technology, apathetic, lazy and bored, simply going through the motions. A world in which the class divide is even harsher than ever, as the rich enjoy life on the outer worlds, with the lower classes and criminals left to rot under the torrential and permanent acid rain. The narrative mysteries are intriguing enough, as is the eternal question as to Deckard's true origins, but I have always found BLADE RUNNER to be most enjoyed as a purely visual experience. Like 2001 it is a film of spectacle, which begins to falter when it is embroiled in narrative exposition. This is the simplest of films and one which embodies the ideology of cinema from the silent era, the wonder of illusion.

 Unfortunately Warner's DVD is dreadful, with no special features to speak of, not even a single trailer. I understand that this film was released at the infancy of DVD, but there is no excuse for having not released a special edition since.

109866,5,0790729628,"While there are technical issues with this version, and I suggest waiting for Ridley Scott's 'actual' director's cut to come out before buying, I'd like to focus on the STORY of this version.

The good things about this version's story:
- The voice over has been removed - Scott never wanted a voice over, but the studio made him add one so that the movie wouldn't be 'too hard to follow'; I like it better without (though I've seen the theatrical release often enough that it still runs through my head in places).
- The ending is no longer 'Hollywood happy' but instead ambiguous - again under studio mandate, Scott had to add a happy ending for the theatrical version; I like this ending better, and it's certainly more true to the overall feel of the movie.

Problems:
- The awkwardly added unicorn dream scene - I've read a lot of Dick, but even so that didn't prepare me to see how this dream told us Deckard may be a replicant (as Scott indicated in interviews).

Overall, 'Blade Runner' is only loosely based on Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,' yet it still succeeds (and Dick approved of this script before he died).  It offers a good script, great story, humanized villains, good acting, and a great score by Vangelis.  Even to this day, it taunts us with a glimpse of the ecologically devastated world we may be moving towards - and that's just background ambiance.  What this movie really does is to explore one of Dick's major themes - what does it mean to be human?  If it looks like a woman, emotes like a woman, desires to live like a woman and you shoot it in the back because those in authority tell you to, have you committed murder?  Not an easy question to answer, and much more important to contemplate than an alien invasion.",1150934400,2,1761,4.515723270440252

109868,5,0790729628,"Ridley Scott's sci-fi classic ""Blade Runner,"" one of the first movies to appear on DVD in 1997, is being restored and remastered for a brief reissue in September.

The DVD, featuring the 1992 ""director's cut,"" will be deleted after four months, and replaced by a 25th-anniversary ""final cut,"" which Warner Home Video is billing as Scott's ""definitive new version"" of the film.

After a limited theatrical release, the newly spruced-up ""Runner"" will be released in a multidisc special edition DVD that also will include the original theatrical cut, the expanded international theatrical cut and the 1992 director's cut.

Warner said specifics about the two DVD editions will be announced later.

The director's cut first came out on DVD before optimal formatting standards had been established, said Doug Pratt, editor of the DVD-LaserDisc Newsletter.

""Shortly afterwards, it went into moratorium. The early adopters who bought the title have long since wished to see it upgraded, while other fans, who came into DVDs later on, have been unable to find it at all. It is the only 'big' sci-fi spectacle currently unavailable on DVD,"" Pratt said.

""Runner"" stars Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah and won plaudits -- as well as two Oscar nominations -- for its dark, bleak vision of the future. Ford heads the cast as Rick Deckard, a futuristic cop -- the film is set in 2019 Los Angeles -- who needs to kill four errant human clones who hijack a spaceship back to Earth after escaping from exile in an off-world colony.

The film opened in theaters in summer 1982, and while it grossed only $26.2 million, it quickly became a cult classic. The film is based on the novel by late science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, whose prose also led to such films as ""Total Recall,"" ""Minority Report"" and ""Paycheck.""

109870,3,0790729628,"Let me begin by agreeing, and without entering into debates over whether the original theatrical release or the Director's Cut is better (personally speaking, however, I do prefer the Director's Cut), Blade Runner is far and away one of the finest SciFi flicks ever committed to celluloid.

But the very bad news, like others have already noted, is that this DVD transfer of the movie is absolutely abysmal!

I own both the VHS as well as the DVD versions of Blade Runner.  But the DVD version is actually, and inconceivably, worse than the VHS. I'm not engaging in hyperbole, I don't think, when I say that the DVD comes across as if someone snuck a handheld video camera into a local movie theater, filmed Blade Runner, and then pressed the image onto a DVD.  (I should note I'm strictly speaking of the Region 1 DVD release for North America.  But other regions may fare better.  For instance, I've heard the Region 2 transfer, for Europe, is actually quite good.  Not sure if this is indeed true, or if so, why, but you can perhaps google around for more info if you're interested.)

In fact, in my opinion, it's not even worth the currently reduced Amazon price of $9.99. If you must have the movie right this minute, perhaps if you need it for a gift, I'd recommend purchasing the VHS instead. The VHS version is not anything outstanding, but it's not by any means ""bad"" either, and it's certainly better than the DVD in picture quality.

Morever the DVD is essentially a bare bones, movie-only version; it does not include additional special features.

Thankfully, however, Blade Runner fans are not left at an impasse. The latest, and yes, official news -- not rumor! -- is that Warner Bros. Studios will be releasing a new limited DVD edition of the 1992 Director's Cut of Blade Runner in Sept. 2006! This edition will only be offered for a few months, until the end of the year, I believe, or possibly until the beginning of next year, 2007. Then it will be followed by a theatrical release of an updated, ""ultimate"" Director's Cut of the film, which is basically everything that Ridley Scott has ever wanted to do with the film (no word on specifics, though, at least that I know), to celebrate Blade Runner's 25th anniversary. And then the biggest news is that all this will eventually be followed with a colossal multi-disc DVD edition of Blade Runner, which should include every version of Blade Runner ever released, including the latest theatrical run.

HD-DVD and Blu-ray versions are also in the works, but I don't think there are any set dates for these.

So, if you can wait, there's much for Blade Runner fans to look forward to! :-)",1148688000,12,2654,4.659528907922912

Some film historians and critics find many influences of the film noir style of film making in this film, calling it  neo-noir, cyberpunk or tech-noir.

To prove this film falls in this style it must include certain elements, all of which are in Bladerunner:

Visual style:  while not in black and white, the film does make use of dramatic shadows with low key lighting, creating a bleak environment.

Setting: film noirs tend to be centered around flawed individuals in a world that has no room for forgiveness.  Crime is a central element of the story and the protagonist is often a detective or  crime fighter (Decker).  Archetypal characters that are often found are corrupt cops, femme fatals (Hannah and Woods) and down and out characters.  Noir films are generally set in Los Angeles,  New York or San Francisco - so the setting in Bladerunner is dead on.

Morality:  Noirs tend be ambiguous, the characters may have absolute moral values, but their cynical worldview forces them, or allows them, to adopt a way of life in which the ends justifies the means.  The very ambiguity of a noir film often finds the characters searching for what is right or wrong.  Again, Bladerunner fills the bill.

Outlook of the film:  Film noir is basically romantic in nature and strives to tell the story of people who are trapped in situations beyond their control (the replicants with pre-set life spans) and are almost always doomed.  Film noir plots also center around the hard-boiled, disillusioned, cynical world view of the male protagonist - Decker.

Other common features of a film noir movie are the voice over narrations, thus the use of Harrison's voice as narrator and flashbacks to tell parts of a story.

If you are not a fan of film noir or tech-noir, I can certainly understand the preference for the Director's Cut version.  But, if you like film noir, the theatrical version is the way to go.",1148256000,5,2084,4.7465181058495824

Perhaps the film reviewers in Los Angeles are so used to their dry climate that the mere thought of a LA where the rain is constantly falling is science fiction to the max.  With that said, the issues that keep this movie from moving into the classic category are many.  How does a genetically engineered replicant decide to go from the Outer Colonies to be a snake dancer in a sleazy strip club?  Programming?  The others sure seem to have rejected their programming, especially the ""First Law of Robotics.""  Note the hint of an abundant fossil fuel economy, lack of vision for cell phones, excessive drinking and smoking (really reminded me of Casablanca, but Casablanca wasn't mimicking the future), and two-tiered society (""If you are not police, you are one of the little people.""

1) Original theatrical version with Harrison Ford voiceover narration and ""happy"" ending which featured landscape footage that Stanley Kubrick cut from the credits of ""The Shining.""  This was shown at the end when Deckard and Rachael made their escape and he said there was hope that she would live.  They say they showed the film to test audiences who didn't ""get it,"" so they made Ford come back to the studio to narrate it.  He didn't want to, so he delivered it in the flat, deadpan voice on purpose.

2) This version, which ""contains scenes of graphic violence edited from the theatrical version.""  THIS IS THE VERSION YOU WANT!  Aside from the ""director's cut"" this is the best.  It has the same as the theatrical and MORE.  It shows an extended version of Harrison Ford gunning down the first female replicant, a longer and more brutal fight between him and Pris, and Roy Batty kills Tyrell and we get to see his thumbs poke out the man's eyes. That's about it, but it is worth it if you watch the narrated version.

3) A 10 Year Anniversary which is not much different than the above two.

4) The director's cut which trims the ""graphic violence"" footage, removes the voiceover narration, adds a unicorn scene (taken from footage of Ridley Scott's movie ""Legend"") which suggests Deckard might be a replicant (as does the original Philip K Dick book), and trims the landscape footage at the end, stopping the movie where Deckard and Rachael flee.

Rated R for violence and language.

""Blade Runner"", directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", is a science-fiction/noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to ""retire"" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as ""Replicants"". The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.  Ridley Scott's hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant. It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil. Corruption is everywhere. The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we've seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.

The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his ""Chariots of Fire"" score), consisted mainly of jazz and blues. This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.  The special effects and cinematography are exceptional, with much of the set was pulled off using models. The sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worka, as well as the actors who gave voice to it. Harrison Ford is his usual self, doing a tremendous job down-playing the role. His voice-over narration helps the audience along, and was yet another feature conducive to the film noir of the 1940's.  Rutger Hauer's performance was intense and his lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical, while Daryl Hannah's chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  There is more to this film than just pulp. It works on so many remarkable levels. The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live? Why do I have to die? What happens when I die? Doesn't my maker care? Is this all merely an illusion? At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant. Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today. In a sense, the ambiguity of ""Blade Runner"" is the culprit of its success.  A great spectacle of a film that is much more than just its resounding effects, but an intriguing glance into a world that may not be so futuristic after all.",1135814400,12,3345,4.948214285714286

But they rebel against their creators, and want to live longer than the pre-encoded 4 year life span. They manage to find and kill their creator (Doctor Tyrell). But ""the Bladerunner"" (a police detective played by Harrison Ford) finds and destroys them all. Except for one (a replicant of Tyrell's niece) whom he falls in love with.

With very romantic soundtrack mellodies, composed by Vangelis, and fantastically beautiful buildings from the Los Angeles of the future, this movie is a sci-fi classic, setting the standards for generations of movies to come.
The story is analogous with the problems of immigrants who want to stay in America, but the INS denies them the rights to do so.

I would recommend the original film, not the director's cut.
The director's cut has a sad end, confirming that the beloved Rachel (the replicant that the Bladerunner falls in love with) will die, like anyone else.
The original film has a more uplifiting end, saying ""I don't know how long we have together... who does?""

Slow movie but beautifully done (the lighting is absolutely amazing), the film noir-scif-fi classic Blade Runner is an awesome tale from a philosophical stand point as well as an action-drama movie point of view. While the movie can be slow at times, one must take into consideration the year it was made and the book which preceded it.

Blade Runner is of course based on (quite loosely) Philip K. Dick's masterpiece, ""Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep?"" and while in no way does the movie compare to the book, at least in aesthetics (painted by words that is rather than fancy lighting), the story is largely the same if not a bit twisted in it's overall ""message."" Regardless while the movie isn't entirely faithful to the book, it sure presents the moviegoer with some excellent visuals, cool story, and all around excellent balance of fun and serious subject matter.

Blade Runner can be extremely slow at times and while Ridley Scott was trying - at the time the film was made - to dazzle the audience with special effects, such effects might come off as overly pretentious. At least the slow gaps in the story sure as hell do, but with a classic, things like this are often overlooked and so to does my review overlook them.

Again, great movie - decent enough acting and all around great experience!

[DVD Version]

The touch ups and scene additions are beautiful - as for what the numbers of other complaints are, I have no clue - I saw the Director's cut on television and so perhaps they omitted sections of that. Either way I saw little wrong with it... perhaps it is or isn't worth the buy, but certainly the VHS is (I'd try to rent the DVD yourself to see what all the fuss is about).

Recently I was able to tape record the Director's Cut that was shown on television... no problems that I could see there, perhaps buying the DVD is different though.

109890,5,0790729628,"Three genres are traced back to Expressionism: film noir, science fiction, and horror.  All three are represented to some effect (well, maybe not so much horror, though a few moments are spine-tingling) to create the dirty, sulky atmosphere of 2019 Los Angeles, where the rich have gone to live on the off-world colonies and the rest of humanity bubbles and ferments in a disgusting world of industrial sludge and ever-pouring rain, a world now penetrated by four replicants (androids) escaped from the off-world colonies and who must be hunted down by Deckard, a blade runner.

Such is the overview of the richly articulated and darkly felt exploration into humanity and creation, where humans have created humans and those humans are aggressors against their creators.  Man, beast, and robot are mixed and only divided by social taboos and product numbers, only that doesn't necessarily make the humans much different either considering how literally crushed they are by industry and advertising ever flashing through the streets in neon signs.

The story arch follows Deckard as he is forced unwillingly into hunting down the escaped replicants and slowly finds all roles reversed, both of the hunt and of the status.  As he falls in love with the replicant Rachel, Deckard is forced to hide her from the very people he works for just as much as he's forced to pass their judgement on people whose only crime is the desire to live.  Such poetic exposition is not realized through the human characters; their actions are too mechanic and bland that they nearly seem invisible.  It's realized in the replicants, who desire, love, feel, and hurt.

This is an awesome and powerful look into what it means to be human and God.  Both the stylistic elements and the craftsmanship of this film work together perfectly to create an atmosphere often attempted but never as fully realized in this distinct and important film.  It's a must for all lovers of cinema to experience at least once, and hopefully see again and again and again.

109891,4,0790729628,"Where do you vote in rating the Philip Dick book, the Ridley Scott theatrical film release and the director's cut version? Personally, I go for the theatrical release version of the film. I'd love to see the rumoured director's cut of the director's cut.

What Dick's book is about is the effect man made and man like machines have on the society he lives in, one of Dick's most important themes, which crops up again and again in his books. The film drops Dick's focus on (near future) society for a more action focused plot. In both versions of the film the 'replicants' are actually the heroes, super humans in experience and power who yet are doomed to die at the expiration of their term, a safety device built in by their creator to remove their danger to humanity. It makes them more desperate. In the film these androids are sexy, glamorous and attractive, and Rutger Hauer has one of the best dying speeches in all cinema. In both versions of the film another 'star' is the superb sets, some of the best ever made. The sets alone would elevate this film into classic status, because they create an overwhelming atmosphere against which the action takes place.

Deckard, the blade runner, is an ambiguous protagonist. If you think about it, the police know who these replicants are, and when they are going to 'expire'. Blade runners take out escaped replicants because it is government policy to do so, no more than that. The replicants are dangerous, but so is everyone in this society. Deckard is not a hero, just a bureaucratic killer who is hired to tidy up. Both versions of the film build on his ambiguous status: the theatrical release slightly emphasising more the relationship with Rachael (OK, a conventional romance) while suggesting that she too might be (is) a replicant. The director's cut goes further: Deckard protects Rachael against the replicants but it is hinted that he himself is one.

The director's cut takes out the voice over of the theatrical release, redolent of 40s noir, and so reduces the mystery element of the film in favour of the sci fi action element. Gone also are some of the interaction scenes with Rachael. Deckard becomes more of a standard actioner 'hero', gun raised protectingly over the conventional helpless female. Gone also is the superbly ambiguous ending (""But we don't know how much time we have (together)"". ""Who does"".) which reinforced the romance and the personal relationship theme of the first version. Overall a much more conventional, special effects based action film, with a very deep conflict with Dick's basic theme.

109898,5,0790729628,"Walking home from class one day I pass by my local video rental store.  As luck would have it, it was the first day they were selling off their VHS library.  Curious, I step inside and browse around until I spot a title I've heard before but never really bothered checking out: Blade Runner the Director's Cut.  The combination of a futuristic film noir (two of my favorite genres) and one inspiration to Cowboy Bebop (one of my favorite series)? I decide to part with the 8 dollars.

Before watching the film I feel the need to find out a little more about my version.  Upon checking the reviews I run into a little debate over the better or best version.  As I understand (and to boil things down), the original version was the ""Hollywood (forced/ feel good)"" cut verses Mr. Scott's ""own vision"".  In addition, the DVD Director's cut is a 1st generation release (i.e. distracting/poor transfer quality).  So how was the VHS Director's Cut? Amazing.

From start to finish the film transports us into the gritty streets of a semi-advanced LA, planted in the classic 80's style.  The characters, driven through dimly lit environments and circumstances play very well together- from the decadent nightclubs to a monolithic corporation to apartment housing that mid 20th century forgot.  The music also fuses nicely, between jazz of a contemporary detective mystery and an 80's electronic orchestra, creating the synthesized trumpet that pulls me deeper into the night's chase.  And the performances? (You can read the product description for story) Well, without giving anything away, acting is never excessive, while subdued much of the time- as it needs to be.  It was those moments during the journeys, in between the confrontations that allowed time for the main characters to develop.  When sides did meet, the action was also very believable (like the settings).  In summary, the deliveries only built up until a great finish with an inspiring message to boot.

While that sale went on I also picked up a few other 80's VHS classics:

*Arcadia of my Youth- English Subtitled
Classic from the creator of Interstella 5555(which also has a certain dream-like quality).  'Arcadia' also has a strong positive message it wants to convey.

""EARLY in the 21ST century, the Tyrell Corporation advanced robot evolution into the nexus phase-a being virtually identical to a human-known as a replicant.  The nexus replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence to the genetic engineers who created them.

Replicants were used off-world as slave labor on the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets.  After a bloody mutiny by a nexus combat team in an off-world colony, replicants were declared illegal on Earth-under penalty of death.

Special police squads-Blade Runner units-had orders to shoot to kill upon detection, any trespassing replicant.

This was not called execution.  It was called retirement.""

These are the actual printed words that begin this classic science fiction movie (based on the 1968 novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" by Philip K. Dick).

The plot of this movie is simple.  Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a policeman or ""blade runner"" of Los Angeles (in the year 2019) who's after four criminal ""replicants"" named Roy Batty (Rutger Haur), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), and Leon (Brion James).  Deckard accidentally develops a romance with the more sophisticated replicant Rachael (Sean Young).

Unlike ""The Director's Cut"" version of this movie, this original version has Deckard's voice-over narration.  I found this voice-over especially emotionally appealing when the Roy Batty replicant ""dies"" at the end of the movie.

I think I deduced the reasons why the voice-over is so important for this movie:

(1) It allows the viewer to follow the action.  (A friend of mine who watched ""The Director's Cut"" with me and who did not see the original release with Deckard's voice-over could not follow the story!!)
(2) It provides the human touch to counterbalance all the technological and visually stunning special effects.
(3) It adds a ""retro"" feel that reminded me of old-time detective movies.

The ending, unlike ""The Director's Cut,"" was not abrupt.  This ending gave a feeling of hope that Deckard and the replicant Rachael would have a future together.

All the acting in this movie is first-rate.  Special mention should go to Harrison Ford who as the blade runner Rick Deckard carries the movie and to Rutger Haur as the leader of the replicants, Roy Batty.  Also, Sean Young does a super job portraying the more sophisticated replicant, Rachael.

The special effects that highlight the steel-and-microchip jungle of twenty-first century L.A. and the background music by Vangelis are fantastic and exhilarating.

The only problem is that this original version of this movie is not available on DVD (as of the date of this review).  This is truly unfortunate.  (""The Director's Cut"" is available on DVD.)

BOTTOM LINE:

With its voice-over narration, this is a magnificent and classic science fiction movie with emotional impact.  It's easy to see why this movie won the L.A. Film Critics Award and three British Academy Awards.

109900,5,0790729628,"`Blade Runner', directed by Ridley Scott and starring, in one of his most important roles, Harrison Ford, is quite probably one of the best science fiction movies ever. I would easily put it in the top five with Fritz Lang's `Metropolis', Forbidden Planet', `2001 A Space Odyssey', and another Phillip K. Dick inspired story, `Minority Report'.

I was originally disappointed with this movie when I saw it in the theatre, as it was based on one of Dick's most famous stories, `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and the screenwriters took significant liberties with the story. But one of the surest ways of identifying a high quality movie is when it `grows' on you after repeated viewings. I have probably seen the original theatrical release on VCR and DVD and on broadcast TV at least five times, and I look forward to every viewing. The things which grow in my appreciation of the film as time goes by are Ford's performance and Ridley Scott's great invention of a very dark Los Angles some fifty years (from the time of the filming) in the future. The dark settings are a Ridley Scott trademark and they show up most dramaticly in `Alien', `G.I.Jane', and `Black Sun'. While the effect is great in the Sci-fi and Horror flicks, it really doesn't work in `G.I.Jane', but that's another movie.

`Blade Runner' seems to have embedded itself into our collective unconsciousness. I happened to see an Alton Brown / Food Network special on TV yesterday where our golden boy, AB quoted a line from Sebastian's geneticly engineered minatures in `Blade Runner'.

This movie seems to be the sort of work where everything just seems to hang together very, very well, from the set design to the music to the acting. Virtually all the roles in the movie are small compared to Ford's character, the Blade Runner, Deckard, but there are some which make one wish they had larger parts. Joe Turkel fits his part perfectly as the founder of the Tyrell Corporation. M. Emmet Walsh is also perfectly cast as Deckard's former captain of the Blade Runner unit who calls him back into service. Sean Young does well as Tyrell's closet replicant. The greatest little pleasure outside Ford's role is the performance of William Peterson, much better known as the Larry of the three brothers, Larry, Darryl, and Darryl on the `Newhart' TV show. Brion James, a lesser character actor similarly carries his part well. The two most difficult parts to assess are those by Rutger Hauer and Edward James Olmos. I suspect Olmos is given a major visibility in the credits for this movie more due to his widely recognized part in `Miami Vice' than to his role in this movie itself. Regarding Hauer, I often thought this was by far his best performance and that his whole career is based on the recognition he got from doing this movie. But, having recently seen `The Hitcher' again, I sense that while Hauer does well in these very sinister roles, his acting range is really limited and, like Whoopie Goldberg in `Ghost', the acclaim should go not to the actor but to the casting director.

Oddly, I suspect one of the biggest differences between the theatrical release and the director's cut is to make just a little more of Olmos' role in the movie. The theatrical release doesn't even add any lines for Olmos, just a few more for Ford / Deckard to explain Olmos' character. In general, the theatrical release added just a little more voiceover dialogue to explain things early in the movie and to give the ending a slightly more upbeat resolution.

I was really disappointed with the extras on these DVDs, as missing is my favorite feature, a voiceover commentary by director which explains the scenes in the movie. I suspect that unlike Kevin Smith's movies which make more money in DVD release than in the theatre (and who therefore puts a lot of effort into DVD extras) `Blade Runner' is so good, the DVD producers feel no need to pile on the goodies.

This is a truly great movie whose value increases as time goes by and other filmmakers are unable to top it's story and great atmospheric interpretation of a classic Sci-Fi hypothesis.",1123372800,9,4114,4.754901960784314
109901,5,0790729628,"I'll stand in line to be the millionth to review Blade Runner. I love both the first release with the voiceovers & also the Director's Cut - there were two ways to skin the cat (Blade Runner test image). Blade Runner is a brain wave opera that walks the tightrope on love & anger,good & evil,male & female,beauty & grotesque. The cast was all wonderful - especially Sean Young as Rachael, who walks the tightrope on human & perfection.

The visual effects broke new ground for futuristic films, name a sci-fi film since that hasn't borrowed from Blade Runner in story, appearance and style. Harrison Ford delivers a nuanced and restrained performance and is fully believable. The questions this film raises are the questions that have been asked since the dawn of time and they are handled with much respect and consideration here, far better than any film since, what makes us human? What is the essence of life and what is it's purpose? This film is visually astounding and thought provoking. Every performance in this film is perfect. The ending is mind blowing when Ford's character faces down the films central villian, an android who dreams of being human. Films rarely reach this level of greatness, but when they do it is the cinematic equivalent puppy love, it may not last long but you'll always remember it.",1123027200,3,1010,4.744318181818182

Personnaly, I never thought there was anything wrong with the Harrison Ford narrative voice-over.  It gave the film that classic 1940's film-noir feeling, kind of like hearing Fred MacMurray narrate DOUBLE INDEMNITY.

And as far as the original happy ""Hollywood"" ending through the mountains, isn't it nice to know that in the bleak, grim world of 2019 Los Angeles, there are still some places where the sun shines brightly?

109906,4,0790729628,"This is of course an all-time classic film, but when you think about it, the plot is fundamentally flawed. The story concerns a policeman whose job is to identify and retire fugitive androids. These androids -- ""replicants"" -- are so like real humans that the only way to identify them is, basically, by asking them questions that would make most humans blush and measuring their physiological reactions with sophisticated electronic equipment. This is the so-called ""Voight-Kampf test"". This much Ridley Scott took from the original novel by Philip K. Dick. But then Scott made his replicants superhuman: they are much stronger than humans, and capable of withstanding extremes of heat and cold. When one of them is shot, she jerks spastically like a malfunctioning machine.

Now, it stands to reason that a replicant who can casually plunge her hand into a flask of boiling water without being burned must be physiologically much different than a real human. Therefore, there must surely be easier and surer ways of identifying replicants than the complex 'Voight-Kampf' test.

I've always assumed that Scott intended to make his audiences think about the similarities between the humans and the replicants, and the (im)morality of the former arbitrarily terminating the existences of the latter. But this story would have been much, much more powerful if the replicants were not superhuman but rather were indistinguishable from 'real' humans, so that when one of them is shot down in cold blood, we had only the results of the cop's dubious Voight-Kampf test to assure us that an escaped android has just been retired rather than a innocent woman been murdered. Instead, Scott has spared our consciences by providing the reassuring spectacle of Pris' robotic, mechanical, decidely inhuman death throes. We never have any doubt that these are artificially constructed robots and therefore we don't need to trouble ourselves much about the morality of killing them.",1121126400,7,1967,5.2215189873417724

109912,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner is one of the best two or three films of the scifi genre.  It is listed in some compilations as one of top 100 greatest films of all time.  The role of this film in the scifi oeuvre is similar to that of Tom Sawyer in American literature - it has set the tone for all films in the genre since - that the future will have nicer toys but everything else - including us - will be just as dirty, gritty, and grimy as the present.

This film does have some flaws.  Sean Young (Rachel) is the vision of beauty that she needs to be, but frankly her acting  abilities are embarassing.  Some of the scenes are almost too  hokey to watch.  Harrison Ford is merely adequate, but that's all he needs to be.  At least he wasn't as bad as he was in Star Wars.

Despite the flaws, viewing this film in full surround sound with a large letter-box screen is an amazing experience.  The haunting soundtrack by Vangelis is a masterpiece - this film would be something completely different without it.

It's a pity the producers had to cut Deckard's unicorn dream sequence from the original release.  They did, of course, for obvious commercial reasons.  However, the film loses a potentially vital clue without it - is it coincidence, or does  Gaff's origami unicorn reveal that he knows what's in Deckard's dreams, just as Deckard knew Rachel's?  We are left to wonder if Deckard is himself a replicant or a human - I would say the film intentionally leaves that question up to us.

Violence in film nowadays is almost universally depicted in a gratuitous, cartoonish manner which renders it meaningless except as a plot device or an excuse for special effects.  In contrast, the nightmarish violence depicted in Blade Runner is used to good effect to reflect the essential brutality of life itself.

Ultimately, I think at its highest level Blade Runner is a movie about life lived in the shadow of the awareness of mortality.  Throughout the film, eyes are used to symbolize the quest for self-knowledge as symbolized through the varying degrees of lightness, darkness, and pain.  Almost the entire film is shot in a polluted, rainy darkness, signifying the state of Deckard's soul, with the only glimpses of blue sky evident at the top of the Tyrell Corporation headquarters (where Deckard first meets Rachel), at the moment of Roy's death, and (in the theatrical release) when Deckard escapes with Rachel.

The sequence between the death of Pris and the death of Roy is perhaps the most inspired piece of film-making I have ever seen.  The deeply symbolic nature of the final chase, with the fear of death (in the form of Roy Batty) forcing Deckard to the pinnacle of knowledge and self-awareness atop the Bradbury building, is  beautiful (religiophobes will have to excuse the crucifixion symbology).  Great stuff.",1118275200,3,2814,4.728952772073922

That is the biggest flaw in the Amazon system of rating the reviews.  If you didn't like a film, any film, you are going to get negatives, because the people who are checking out the reviews are people who like the film.

I rented the movie because it appeared on Time's top 100 movies of all time.  I thought it was all right, but not great.  It didn't move me the way it moved other reviewers.  I suppose that means that my own review will be slammed.  But I'm just being honest here.  The movie didn't move me much at all.  The only saving grace is that another of the reviewers said you need to see it more than once to get the impact.  The problem is, I don't want to see it again.

One point I'm confused about.  Is Deckard a robot?  I'm not sure.  Are they leaving it to us to decide?  I don't like that.  Tell us.  It's your movie, so tell us.

The problem goes a bit deeper than that.  I don't really care much if Deckard is a robot.  Deckard didn't involve me enough to care.  The only character I found myself giving a damn about was the robot who didn't know she was one, the one Deckard kissed.

I think viewers are looking for different things out of movies.  I want a movie to reach me, to make me feel something.  Harrison Ford was dry as a martini.  The replicant robots that he was hunting were lukewarm as well.

If this is your favorite movie, good for you.  The simple fact is that it didn't do much for me.  That's my honest reaction.  The only time you are appreciated for criticizing a movie, any movie, is if you are criticizing the picture quality or something, not the movie itself.",1117584000,5,1744,4.2317073170731705
109916,5,0790729628,"I have seen the original 1982 version of the movie several times, and I read the Phillip Dick novel it was based on.  I will compare the Director's cut with both, after I review the movie as a whole.

This is my favorite Sci-fi movie.  Those who have read my other reviews know I divide science fiction into true science-fiction (which is based on what could possibly happen), science fantasy (which is fantasy is a futuristic setting, like Star Wars), and science horror (which is primarily meant to terrify, with the Alien movies and Jurassic Park fitting into this vein).  Both the movie and the novel fit clearly into the first section.  The movie is very thrilling, but the action and suspense do not distract from the themes being explored, and you leave the movie focused more on the themes than on the action (at least I did).

The acting is great.  It wasn't until seeing the movie again that I recognized William Sanderson (Newhart, A&W Root Beer Commercials) as J. S. Sebastian.  Rutger Hauer's portrayal of Roy Batty seemed low key at first, but by the end, his performance reminds me of Malcolm McDowell's in ""A Clockwork Orange.""  Harrison Ford is, well, Harrison Ford.  Sean Young is an attractive love interest, and Darryl Hannah and Joanna Cassidy are appealing as well.

The movie deals with three themes:  1) prejudice, with robots being the new slaves; 2) mortality (in the movie, the androids can only last for four years, and the primary antagonist, Roy Batty is in search of prolonging his life); and 3) what makes a creature human (the androids show signs of humanity and feeling, while the humans, including the protagonist Rick Deckard, can seem to have robotic lack of emotion.

The Director's Cut adds a little to the mortality theme and even more so to the humanity theme.  One of the things done here is the removal of the voice-over that many hate.  I actually enjoyed the voice-over; it made me smile when Ford says his ex-wife referred to him as sushi, cold fish, and the concluding voice-over helped with the upbeat ending, though I considered the ending to be a little out of place.  The lack of the voice-over omits any hint of the marital status of Deckard, though there is definitely no suggestion of him being currently married.  At the end, the upbeat ending is gone, leaving one to believe Sean Young's character may not last more than four years (the voice-over says there was no expiration date for her, allowing for a happily ever after ending).

Having not seen the movie for over 20 years between seeing the original and the director's cut, I saw some scenes I didn't remember, and wondered if they were part of the director's cut.  One scene I knew was added was one of a unicorn running, which was as out of place as the beautiful tree footage at the end of the original.  However, that out-of-place scene does heighten the question of whether Deckard was human or an android.

Most of the time a movie is based on a book, people feel the book is better than the movie.  This absolutely is not the case here.  The movie uses the characters from the book, and some of the setting elements such as most animals being artificial instead of real, but from there it has no similarity to Dick's book ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"".  The novel is more nihilistic (that is, that there is no purpose to anything).  The book also has an anti-religious tone to it, which the movie lacks.

This movie is very violent.  Even the love scene is a little rough for some people.  The violence and one topless scene earned the movie's R-rating.  Thus, I would not recommend it for children at all, and that teen-ager's should see it with parental presence.  To me, though, the development of the themes more than makes up for the roughness of the picture.",1115510400,,3793,4.643178410794603

109919,5,0790729628,"Much has been made of the DVD version of this film, and it does leave a lot to be desired.  No extras, lousy sound, transfer that looks only marginally better than the tape etc.  But, get over it.  Someday we'll get a nice one, and as of right now you can get this version for next to nothing, so you won't loose much of anything in the long run.

`Blade Runner' is just about the ultimate example of the cult film.  Much maligned on release both critically and popularly, it now has a massive cult following and is seen in a much better light from a critical standpoint. (Much like the also brilliant and innovative `The Thing' of the same year.)  Why it took so long to be appreciated I can't say, particualrly since a large part of its genius lies in the groundbreaking visuals, which while extremely impressive today, should have been completely astounding initially.  But, there's more to it then that, as the film has intriguing ideas, mostly courtesy of Phil Dick, and an stunning, compelling climax followed by a moving a truly denoumont.  Unquestionably one of my 10 favorite movies.

Loosely based on the novel `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' by Philip K. Dick, `Blade Runner' is the story of Rick Deckard, a blade runner, meaning a policeman whose duty is to `retire' replicants, who are organic, artificially engineered androids used for slave labor.  He's retired, but is forced back into duty as there is a new case which no one else but him can handle: 4 replicants escaped from the colonies and have returned to earth, seemingly to infiltrate the Tyrell corporation.  (the company responsible for their production)  While searching for them, Deckard finds some important discoveries regarding replicants: First, that they have a mere 4 year lifespan, which explains why they've returned, and second, that they now sometimes implant memories into them so that they function better.  Thus, they don't know if they're replicant, thus anyone *could* be one.

`Blade Runner' is, of course, the seminal `tech-noir' film, cleanly combining an over-populated, over-industrialized, dystopian future with characters and conventions of the noir film and hard-boiled detective novel, complete with a synthesized, future-sleaze soundtrack.  Deckard is a classic noir protagonist, reminiscent of Spade or Marlow.  Not actively malevolent, but far from conventionally moral and distinctly alone.  He's not an incredibly sympathetic character, but for the purposes of the film he needn't, and really shouldn't be.  Some have complained about Ford's acting, but I think he's pefectly fine, as is everyone else in the film.  The real standout is, of course, Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the leader of the replicant group, a powerful, charismatic adonis of man.  This is one of those performances where it is really difficult to conceive of anyone doing it better then he does.  This is a film of complex morals, as pretty much everyone is at least somewhat sympathetic, and no one is obviously right.  Yes, the replicants kill, but they are, for all intents and purposes, human.  Certainly, few would condemn humans for fighting in order to escape enslavement, and we could at least somewhat sympathize with their killing simply in the hopes of gaining more life, especially considering they've only lived for a few years, and have been enslaved for most of that time.  But, the real humans are sympathetic too, as the replicants kill both the wicked and the innocent, and Deckard himself is clearly back against the wall, as he is flatly, if vaguely threatened when he initially refuses the assignment.

`Blade Runner' was and is a miracle of traditional special effects and set design.  I am not inherently opposed to CG, but I think that you should ALWAYS use conventional effects whenever they can do it well.  And here, Scott and company have made a world as complete and real and alive as any you'll ever see.  Visually, `Blade Runner' set the standard for the futuristic dystopia, with endless urban sprawl, impossibly large building and the continous neon glow and flashing lights, mysterious explosions and the perpuetual twilight and rain.  Some modern audienes may be less impressed as they've seen other stuff like this, but they shouldn't be, because this is original, and it's still the best.

The visual power of the film goes beyond the design and into the direction.  This is a very slow-moving, but truly poetic film, with beautiful shot composition and long periods of time with no dialogue.  Make no mistake, this is not an action film by any stretch of the imagination.  It's an arty film, no doubt about it, and a somewhat complex one, but not selfconciously or needlessly so.

Though I don't dare go into specifics, the final confrontation between  Deckard and Roy is fantastic.  It's a truly eerie, otherwordly experience, with some truly fantastic lighting and set-design.  And, like I said before, I think the ending is very powerful.  Nowadays, the

Director's Cut is the only version of the film readily available, and while most people feel strongly one way or the other, I don't care that much.  Yeah, the DC is better, but the changes are sufficiently minimal that it doesn't matter too much.  Yeah, the tacked on happy ending of the TC was lame, but I didn't think it really hurt it that much, and I don't really care too much for the idea that Deckard may be a replicant.  I saw the TC first, and didn't mind the voice overs at all, but seeing the DC made me realize that it's better without it.  The voice- overs kinda take away from the atmosphere and sorta poetic feel of the film, I think.  Still, the film would probably be pretty confusing without them if you didn't really know anything about the movie.  But, if you can get it all together, it definitely works better without them.

As I say a lot, you just have to see it.  If you don't like it that much the first time I strongly urge you to watch it again, as sometimes it takes a while to really take it all in and get into it.  I also recommend Dick's original novel.  They're way different, but each is brilliant in its own right.",1113609600,15,6129,4.830297219558965
109920,4,0790729628,"The film is an adaptation of the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, an early exponent of a science fiction genre called cyberpunk. As the film opens, we stare at a black screen up which creeps the establishing preamble: it is the year 2019 and the Tyrell Corporation is well into production of the nexus phase of robot design. The robots, now known as ""replicants,"" are nearly indistinguishable from their human counterparts. They have human intelligence but greater strength for which they are used in Off-world colonies as slave labor. Following a series of violent mutinies, their use and presence on Earth has been banned. And special police squads, called blade runner units, have been created to hunt down replicants, who have returned to Earth, and to kill--or retire--them.

The story begins shortly after four replicants have killed their masters, hijacked a ship and made their way back to Earth, and, more specifically, to Los Angeles. There is considerable mystery as to why they would take such a risk in returning, but there is no time for wondering. They have already disabled the city's best blade runner. So, the police pressure a former department star, named Deckart, to rejoin the hunt despite his obvious distaste for the morally ambiguous activity of retiring replicants. Deckart knows that where there are big people and little people, the little do the bidding of the big. So, he reluctantly accepts and begins his search with a visit to the Tyrell Corporation itself. There he meets Rachel, a new-generation replicant with whom he will establish a bond of gratitude and love. With various leads and powers of observation and serendipitous detection reminiscent of the stuff of Philip Marlow, Deckart proceeds to hunt down and retire Lyn, Leon, Pris and then, maybe, Roy. But Roy will deliver Deckart a lesson in irony as he leads him back to his humanity through pain, fear, compassion and marvel.

This is, undoubtedly, Scott at his finest in terms of design and composition. The world of 21st century L.A. is a world corrupt, broken and oppressed by its own success. It is a perpetual momento mori--a dark, limitless expanse, punctuated by a chaos of city lights and giant towers spitting fire heaven-ward in what looks like one giant refinery. The night is endless as is the rain, and the blare of neon seems an emphatic reminder of Deckart's remote, impassible stance--it is perception from an alienated vantage point--cold but illuminating. Interiors are choked with light and suffused with colors and a kind of luminous preciosity borrowed from Vermeer. Blues are too extraordinarily blue to be of this world and reinforce the dull swelter of the everyday. And such color schemes and oppressive gigantism do perfectly combine with this future's withered moral landscape to create a film so close to the values of original film noir that it has since been deemed its first related successor genre, neo-noir.

So, if you're looking for something dark and lovely and militantly fatalistic, please consider Blade Runner (not the director's cut), starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Darryl Hannah and Edward James Olmos.",1112745600,4,3187,5.066666666666666

I don't know if for every one BLADE RUNNER fan like me who feels this way there's at least a million fans who feel that the director's cut is unquestionably superior and can't imagine why anyone would perfer the origonal cut, but let me assure you, I am not suggesting we get rid of the directors cut, (I do respect the fact that there are people who like that version better,) just that they make the BLADE RUNNER DVD with the option of being able to watch either the 1982 version or director's cut. I know Ridley Scott always wanted a film with no narration and a bleak/ uncertain ending, but I'd like him to know there are those of us who liked the film just fine the way it was first released and would very much like to still be able to watch it that way.

Also, regarding the changes, sometimes the narration does help clear things up a bit. Otherwise what WAS that weird language Gaff was speaking to Deckard the first time he met him? And as for the director's cut, how about that unicorn dream? What was THAT all about? (If it was supposed to mean anything, it went completly over my head.) Finally, the back of the case for the director's cut states that this new version provides evidence that Deckard just might be a replicant himself and not know it. If that really is true, I missed that completly when watching the director's cut as well. I noticed no evidence that Deckard just might be a replicant.",1112659200,10,1639,4.391447368421052

109926,2,0790729628,"From the moment that I saw this film in '82 until today, it's remained among my favorites.  For the life of me, however, I cannot understand why the director eliminated the narration from this film.

Many of you may not know this, but there once was a movie genre called FILM NOIRE.  These movies usually involved a really good, loner type detective, like ""Sam Spade"" or the like.  He would walk you though the film using narration that highlighted what he was thinking while you watched him perform his investigative duties with a featureless ""poker face"" to fool the bad guys.

Periodically, and most often impersonated, the detective would ""step out"" of a scene he was in and talk to the audience instead of narrating over the action.  Perhaps you've seen old Bogart films where he'd stand under a light pole in the rain and recite a monologue to the audience about how he felt the case was going or to highlight another character's actions, behaviors or personalities according to him.  THAT is E X A C T L Y what Blade Runner was meant to depict in a futuristic setting.  It worked WELL, and it is sorely missed from the director's cut.

Honestly, and many will agree, unless you've seen the original cut of this film, you lose a LOT of information that helps you understand the story to the fullest.  If I'm ""whining"" or ""don't understand the `new school' "" and you DISAGREE blindly, then don't you EVER use the CAST/CREW COMMENTARY feature on you DVDs again.  Yeah...I THOUGHT so!!!

So-perhaps those with the ""power"" can do what many of us are asking:  Give us our movie back...the way it was MEANT to be seen...the way WE remember it.",1109462400,12,1643,4.6048109965635735

109929,5,0790729628,"In reference to ""Blade Runner"" I found this remark in one of the customer reviews:

""The only part I liked was when Blondy was killing the guy""

My god, is this getting very common or what?  I first thought the person didn't like the film because he/she was bored with the story because it didn't have a bunch of mindless action adventure scenes in it.  But, then I came across that sentence that I have been seeing time and time again in other articles dealing with older films.

It used to be, just 20 year ago, that mainly only men were killing evil men.  There were very few evil women and except for the victims of horror films women very seldom died in movies.  Sometimes I think ""Blade Runner"" got away with the good guy gunning down women because they were regarded as machines, computers or replicants.  Because, one thing you very rarely see is a good guy gunning down an evil female.

So, here we have someone stating that the only good part of this film is a woman gunning down a man.  Now why is it so wrong to have it the other way around?  Ever since the 1980's all of sudden women were killing the bad men but at the same time women organizations were complaining about the horror films showing women being murdered.

Well, the movie might make more since and wouldn't be as boring to these people if they could see the original version.  In the original version Deckard and Blondie (Rachael) are heading off together and Deckard states that he didn't know how much time they would have together because Rachael had unlimited time.  I do not know what is so horrible about that ending but who really does?",1109030400,2,1621,4.450847457627119
109930,4,0790729628,"Warner Bros had a downer on this film just prior to its release. Test audiences were inconclusive in their verdicts and Warner Execs insisted that Ridley Scott edit the film, considering it far too downbeat for mainstream audiences.

The result was the voice over narrative which apparently Harrison Ford tried to make as unconvincing as possible so that the Execs at Warners would drop it - he failed. Scenes were deleted, and the upbeat flying sequence at the end of the film was added.

The film opened to ok returns in the US but did huge business in Europe. In the UK release, it filled cinemas nightly for weeks with many people choosing to make return visits.

The early 1990s saw the release of the Directors Cut which was minus the narrative and the upbeat end sequence. It saw some scenes such as the Unicorn sequence restored. Although a limited

release, fans turned out in droves, particularly in London's West End.

I must confess that I enjoy both versions as different approaches to the same film. I have recently ordered 'The International Version' which apparently is an augmented version of the first release so I will pass comment on that when it arrives.

Set in the future, it sees Los Angeles as a rainy, polluted, and totally cosmopolitan metropolis. Mankind has colonised other worlds and uses synthetic humans known as replicants, with superhuman abilities to carry out the dirtier work that doing this involves. Being superhuman comes at a price, as the lifespan for a replicant is only 4 years. The plot revolves around a former cop (Harrison Ford) who specialises in hunting down replicants. Known as a Bladerunner, his task is to eliminate any replicants setting foot on Earth where the punishment for doing so is death or 'retirement'to quote the jargon of the time.

Ford's character has quit the job but is blackmailed into hunting down a particulary dangerous group of replicants who have made it to Earth. Their leader is played by Rutger Hauer, who together with his companions are on a dangerous quest to find an end to their limited lifespan.

Visually the film is stunning with its depiction of a gaudy and seedy futuristic metropolis. Flying cars, huge neon signs, and advertising blimps dominate the skyline. Life is cheap and violent in this future, and the point is not lost on the viewer that this is a highly likely evolution of our society.

The replicants hunt for more life reflects that of humanity's generally, and Ridley Scott's depiction of a replicant meeting his cold and heartless maker, mirrors ongoing theological questions that ultimately we all have to varying degrees.

The drama plays out in the style of a classic detective/ Film Noir story, against a superbly realised Sci Fi background.

A sequence that could have been cut is the sickly symbolic scene with the dove (which apparently was Rutger Hauer's own suggestion). It detracts from the film and is cloying.

What prevents me from giving the dvd 5 stars though is the lack of 5.1 sound on any discs that I have viewed so far.... This film is not so great in Pro logic sound, someone please give it a full digital soundtrack so as to do it the justice that it received in its cinema release!

See it though for what it is, a superbly staged Sci Fi Film Noir which reflects on the human condition, and the future that probably awaits us.",1107475200,3,3354,4.772020725388601
109931,5,0790729628,"This is a great movie. It stands well by itself, of course, but it also taps into a lot of movie-making history and brings it up to date.

The plot is about a manhunter whose job is to take down escaped slaves, the factory made ""replicants"". A replicant is human in just about all ways except the serial number and a built-in expiration date of just a few years. This makes for lots of good chasing and shooting in the movie's bleak cityscape. The Tyrell Corporation, maker of the replicants, keeps improving their product line, up to experimental model Rachel. She, of course, is the romantic interest and puts the last edge on the moral issue at hand: how human is human enough?

The setting is updated noir, with all the standard fixtures. Harrison Ford is the hard-boiled detective (or close enough), Rachel tends towards 40s fashions, and the vastly wealthy tycoon is at the center, above the law but not above justice. Ridley Scott has captured the real noir atmostphere, where everything is dirty. The extortionist police chief, with the bottle in his desk drawer, is dirty. The city is dirty. The slaving business is dirty, especially the ""entertainment"" slaves stocked like any other commodity at the military outposts. The air is dirty, always smoke or grey rain. Even the information environment is polluted. No matter where you go, ads, propaganda, automated voices, and flashing lights pound pointlessly into your awareness, following you indoors through the windows. Even more than in the ""Alien"" movies, Scott got the mood right this time.

Most of all, there's the question: how human does a being have to be? ""Do you ever make a mistake? Have you taken the test yourself?"" Would an autistic child pass the test, or any other person on the edge of the bell curve? The situation, human bodies and minds built on a factory floor, is fiction. The fact, however, is that we really do have levels of technical control over life that were incomprehensible even ten or twenty years ago, and growing. Good SF, like this, examines the issues before they become physically real.

Set in 21st Century Los Angeles, ""Blade Runner"" is the story of a jaded, borderline depressive detective (played by Harrison Ford) who's been manipulated into hunting down a potentially dangerous series of 'replicants.' Replicants look human but aren't; nor are they robots. Rather, they are synthetic humanoids created in labs and virtually identical to human beings. Of course, as with all film noir detectives, Harrison Ford ends up learning far more about personal and societal corruption than he does about the case he is investigating. The film's visual style is stunning, especially considering that it was released in 1982; huge chunks of James Cameron's ""Terminator"" and ""Dark Angel"" series would have been impossible without ""Blade Runner,"" and the film also mightily influenced Japanese animation for over a decade. It was a welcome antidote to the ""Star Wars"" formula when it was released.

""Blade Runner"" is a worthy addition to your collection if you are a noir or science-fiction fan. If these interests intersect, as they do with me, you will love this movie.

Unfortunately, ""Blade Runner"" was one of the first DVDs released in the 1990s. As such, there are no extras to speak of (though it includes subtitling and both widescreen/fullscreen versions), and it only contains Ridley Scott's ""director's"" cut of the movie, which is slightly different than the version shown in theaters in 1982. Due to extended behind-the-scenes legal problems, it's unlikely that we will see ""Blade Runner"" rereleased in a more extensive package anytime soon.

This version is much slower and more self-indulgent.  Whereas the first 1/3 of the studio cut was a little slow, in this director's cut it's more like the first 3/4 of the film positively CRAWLS along, loaded with tons of fat that was justifiably trimmed off---it's as if Scott were trying to emulate Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" artistic genius.  And, sorry to say, fails miserably.

The only improvement with this version is that the ending is much more open-ended which fits in better with the whole content of the film, as opposed to the studio version's imposed Cliched Happy Ending.

I was also disappointed that the DVD contains zero bonus features, other than the choice of Widescreen on one side and Standard Screen on the other.  It would've been nice to have the option of viewing different endings, or having the director's version on one side and the studio version on the other.

For those of you who've never seen this film, it's based on Phillip K. Dick's postmodern classic, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""  The subtext of the film, which is much more developed in the novel, is the blurring line between humans and machines especially in a dystopian corporatist and hyper-technological future---or rather, an exploration of what we conventionally think of as ""human nature"" itself.  Namely, in what ways are humans similar to machines?  Like the androids in the film, we also become aware of our mortality and try, in equally futile and pathetic ways, to resist it.  Like the androids we also base our personal identity on our memories.  And like them, we are also very much programmed and conditioned to be controlled, manipulated and regimented into narrow slots by  our social elites, which like in the film consist mainly of oligarchical corporations.

Unfortunately, neither versions of this film really delve into those subversive questions at the expense of sci-fi entertainment.  The original studio cut was however a far lesser evil.",1103760000,9,2092,5.058309037900875

I have heard through the years about the incredible places this film takes you. A dark, crowded metropolis full of fumes and sick rejects. Let me say, visually it exceeded my expectations. Although I am fully aware how they created the environments I was looking at, I still caught myself with my jaw creeping open. It's pretty incredible. Tall skyscrapers riddle every street and no matter which direction you look, there are always thousands of bystanders to keep you from moving any faster then a hobble. Its always been funny to me how films of any decade, not just the 80's, envision the future. In the 40's, tv shows depicted us living on distant planets by the year 2000. (Conan echoes in my head.) Also, in the majority of 80's flicks (aka: Total Recall etc...) they have everyone in goofy garb with bad haircuts and freaks lurking on every corner. Fortunately, Blade Runner skipped that idealism pretty smoothly. There is a fraction, but the murkiness and dank environments wash these visuals away. It all meshes nicely.

I especially liked Vangelis' score. It has a ""washing"" effect over the visuals, and it works on a unique level. Its obvious they wanted this to sound otherworldly. Success.

I can sum up the quality of this dvd's composition with one word: Bitter. The film itself is better than vhs, so I'm not going to complain. Thats all most care about anyway. The Menu is horrible, and jeez, a flipper? This year marked the 20'th anniversary.

They failed...I wonder if they still drag people behind horses in some states...?

Usually, I either love or hate a film. I don't like being gray, it can be too confusing and is usually a waste of time. But, Blade Runner is a paced epic in its own right. I recommend that anyone who watches a film to escape from reality for a couple of hours should see it. It is by no means perfect, but atleast it takes time to breath. That's a hard quality to find now a days.",1103500800,3,2389,4.574766355140187
109944,5,0790729628,"You could say best movie ever, best adaption from a book (Do androids dream of electric sheep? by Phillip K Dick) it's that good.  This is more than a film its a stunning cinematic achievement. Whether you like the OV or the DC is irrellevant personally I like the accidental Original Version and the happy ending. Although he didn't want to do it Harrison Ford makes a good film noir narrator and his voice over matches his characters outsider demeanor as he hunts down the replicants.  This movie really is my all time favorite I have to see it atleast once a year.  It had a dreamcast Sean Young, Harrison Ford,James Edward Olmos,Rutger Hauer,Emmit Walsh, Brion James, Daryl Hannah some of these great actors early in their careers.  Ofcourse Harrison Ford's performance goes without saying it remains one of his best.  Sean Young has never played a more likeable character than Rachel. Unlike John Carpenter's ""Escape from New York"" Ridley Scott had the sense to set it far enough in the future 2019 that today it is still just as effective as when it came out.  When you think of Sci-Fi usually it is way way in the future and usually in space or other planets but amazingly this LA of the future saga makes for the best of the genre.  The opening titles sequence is incredible, the triumphant music justaposed with the open onto the dark rainy cityscape LOS ANGELES NOVEMBER 2019 with the factory towers spewing fire into the nightsky, the flyovers the giant electronic bilboards Coca Cola still rules, the glass pyramid  tyrell building the city reflected on Holden's eye as he prepares to interview replicant Leon, wow incredible film!!!!Vangelis soundtrack is extraordinary!  There's something about this dark rainy grim futureworld that is so compelling! The irony that Deckard ends up falling in love with one of the created beings that he routinly hunts down for a living and the effect it has on him makes us all think of our fragil human existence. Like tears in rain.  This is movie rocks!!!! 100 stars

109945,5,0790729628,"While I think I prefer the directors cut to the original (although I'm not as adamant about it as some), I've noticed something in recent years.  There's alot of us out there who swear by this movie, but almost all of us saw it for the first time as the theatrical version.  People seeing the directors cut fot the first time don't seem to like it as well.

As akward as the voice over was (I didn't think it was that bad to begin with), I've begun to believe it was neccesary at least for the first or second viewing.  Some very important, beautiful subtext just may not be there strongly enough without it.

So if you're a first timer and you can actually find the original version, start with that.

Why I like the movie-  Harrison Ford is fine in this.  Yes he is a bit flat, as people say (course I think he usually is).  What's interesting about this movie on a character basis is not Deckard, but Roy Battey.  Roy Battey is one of my all time favorite movie characters.  The murderous genious child man who hasn't had enough time to understand morality and wants nothing more than time.  The ending of the movie makes sitting through the slow bits completely worth while.

I think it's the ommision of the voice over explanation of some of the events at the end of the film that seems to be making it more challenging for new audeinces.  The visuals, textures and ideas are why this film is good, but it's the ending that made this film great.",1102118400,12,1450,4.361940298507463
109946,3,0790729628,"First impressions are usually the most lasting.

That said, I feel that the ""Director's Cut"" of BLADE RUNNER should have been packaged along with
the original ""Theatrical"" release only as a comparison offering to anyone really interested in seeing
how this film was intended to be viewed by the film maker.

I first saw BLADE RUNNER on ""The Movie Channel"" back in the early 80's. To say that I was literally
blown away by this movie (as I was by THE ROAD WARRIOR and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK) is an
understatement! The dark presentations of our society/world in a not-so-distant future in these films
really hit home for me.

Remember... this was the early period of the ""Reagan Years"". The ""Cold War"" was still a reality, ""1984""
was just a stones throw away on the calander, the 21st Century still seemed far over the horrizon, and
respected scientists such as Carl Sagan constantly reminded us that ""it is not inconceivable that we
could destroy ourselves... in a moment of unforgivable negelect... tomorrow.""

Okay... back to the movie! LOL

Why do I prefer the ""theatrical"" release over the ""Director's Cut""? My answer is simple. BLADE RUNNER, as
originally released... just ""feels correct"". The voice-overs give the film that 1940's detective movie ""feel"".
The ending is one of HOPE... for humanity, the future, doing the ""right"" thing, and yes... for LOVE.
When I purchased the ""Director's Cut"" on VHS some years later (1993?), what I watched left me feeling
empty, cold, and most definitely feeling like SOMETHING was ""missing""! I have watched this version twice,
to make sure my first impressions were not misplaced.

So SORRY...

but if this is what the makers of this film originally intended us to feel...

then give me the ""theatrical"" offering...

ANYtime!

You don't like the director's cut of Blade Runner? Well, if you want the theatrical version of Blade Runner, it is available on VHS, but not DVD or laserdisc. You can buy it for $2 off someone who is selling it on Amazon.",1099958400,3,312,4.379310344827586
109950,4,0790729628,"I've had the director's cut of Blade Runner for about 12 years now, on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD.  I wasn't able to find the theatrical release, and I've always disliked the director's cut, but I could never put my finger on exactly why.  He cut out the voiceover at the beginning and made the ending cooler, and still I always thought that adding the unicorn in the middle was goofy and unnecessary.  I figured Scott just had some extra footage from Legend that he wanted to find a place for.  He almost completely cut Tim Curry out of the director's cut of Legend, so I expect him to do inexplicable things from time to time.

Then I saw it:  At the end, the other cop leaves an origami of a unicorn at Deckard's apartment.  This explains what Scott was trying to do.  It's supposed to tell Deckard that he's a replicant, due to the fact that Deckard had a ""vision"" of a unicorn earlier in the film.  Everyone knows his thoughts, too, because he's a freakin' robot.

This is the stupidest plot twist in the entire history of cinema!
And here are a few reasons why:

1.  Deckard got beat up, bloodied and pounded on by every single replicant in the entire movie, with the exception of Sean Young.  If he were intended to be a replicant he wouldn't have been so fragile.  Don't you think he could at least have been able to beat up Daryl Hannah or Joanna Cassidy?

2.  At the beginning of the movie he's a retired cop.  Wouldn't he have to have been a cop for a while before in order to now be a retired cop?  I thought they only lived for five years.

3.  The whole point of the story is that he's a human who kills without feeling, like a robot, and he falls in love with a replicant because he realizes the replicants are more alive than he is.  This is reinforced for Deckard when Roy saves Deckard's life when he doesn't have to.  Roy loves life so much he gives Deckard his as a gift.  Without this dynamic, what's the point of the movie?  Seriously, George Lucas would look at this and say ""Man, you shouldn't mess with your movies.""

4.  If the cops all know Deckard is a replicant, and they know Rachel is at his house, why don't they ice the both of 'em?  Instead, they let them get away?  Maybe that's why they pulled the happy ending; when they got to the bottom floor in the elevator the cops shot them both down.

In spite of the fact that it has no extras, no 5.1 sound, and the worst stunt doubling in the history of movies, I still love the movie.  In fact, now that I know why the unicorn is there, I can ignore Scott's ineptitude and enjoy PKD's story the way it was intended to be.",1098921600,24,2599,4.234215885947047
109951,2,0790729628,"Blade Runner is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. This was the first DVD I ever bought. To say I was disappointed with the 'Director's Cut' underscores my disgust. I saw the original theatrical release of this film several times back in the day. It blew me away! The effects, the atmosphere - everything is perfect. I know a lot of people here prefer the 'Director's Cut' but I gotta tell ya, IT SUCKS!

 Give me the original any day. The narration is excellent despite Ford's claim that he didn't even seriously try to read the lines. Put the violent scenes back in just out of principle, I am damn sick of edits! (Read my other reviews)...

TECHNICAL:
  I agree with other reviews about the dated technical aspects of this film. We desperately need a 'special' edition with dual-layer anamorphic widescreen and the choice of either 'Theater' or 'Director Cut' versions like on the ""Independence Day"" DVD. Better yet why not release a high bit rate edition (like Superbit), no movie has ever been more deserving of this treatment than 'Blade Runner'.",1098835200,15,1065,4.735135135135135

  Warner Home Video was the first to release 4 DVDs in Japan for 1996, including Blade Runner.  Now, here is where things get a bit confusing:  For the U.S. launch of DVD in March of 1997, it is widely believed that Batman was the first DVD released in the U.S.  This is not true.  5 days before Batman was released, four Imax films were released on DVD, beating Warner Home Video to the U.S. market.

  How does this relate to Blade Runner you ask?  Well, to the best of my knowledge, the initial release of Blade Runner in the U.S. (catalog 12682) is the only U.S. release DVD with a 1996 copyright on the back.  It's a possibility that the other three titles Warner released in Japan in 1996 also have the 1996 copyright for the U.S. versions, but I just don't know...

109957,5,0790729628,"Not to dismiss the director's cut of ""Blade Runner"", but I have a soft spot for the version I saw in the theatre during the Summer of '82 with it's studio imposed narration and happy ending.  When I saw this film then I was just blown away.  Bear in mind, though, that it was released in the summer of ""E.T."" when the audiences were more inclined toward feel-good alien movies and not somber futuristic sci-fi.  The reviews at the time said it was more style than substance, and the box office was lukewarm.  The fortunes of ""Blade Runner"" were revived with the emerging home video market(Another classic futuristic film was released that summer, ""The Road Warrior"").  Why is this film a classic in either version?  The sets and special effects in this film are just mind-blowing.  It imagines Los Angeles in the year 2020 where hi-tech mingles with decay, where the cultural influences are hybrid Anglo-Mexican-Japanese, and there has been an ecological change in weather patterns where sunny California now more closely resembles Seattle.  The plot involves a group of replicants(androids) with a built-in limited lifespan who escape slave labor in the off-world colonies who return to Earth to find their creator to increase their life expectancy.  Since replicants are outlawed on Earth it is the job of blade runners(bounty hunters) to exterminate them, Deckard (Harrison Ford) being most prominent among blade runners.  Ford gives an appropriately world weary performance as Deckard, something akin to a detective from a Chandler or Hammet novel.  Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the leader of the replicants, gives a multi-leveled performance where we are simultaneous sympathetic to his plight but repulsed by the apparent barbarity of his actions in carrying out his goal.  Sean Young is beautiful and mysterious as Rachel, like a femme fatale from a 40's noir film.  A young Darryl Hannah is also quite good as Pris, one of the replicants.  I'd also like to note the presence of Joe Turkel who plays Tyrell, head of the corporation who created the replicants.  Turkel was a veteran of Stanley Kubrick films, specifically ""Paths of Glory"" and ""The Shining"".  ""Blade Runner"" is a great film in either it's original version and the director's cut.

This film is the very first, the ultimate classic in the cyberpunk genre.  Needless to say, when this was made it was YEARS ahead of its time.  They had no access to real computer graphics back when this was made.  It is almost all done with light, shadow, and amazing photography effects.  And, strangely enough, that is why this film remains impressive - because most of the effects are natural and real, instead of being some kind of computer rendering.

This was a cult favorite in America.  However, this film exploded when it hit the international market, becoming an absolute smash hit in Japan.  The influence of the American film, ""Blade Runner"" can be seen in countless Japanese films and animations.  So that, one could say that Ridley Scott gave birth not only to a great film and a new genre, but also to hundreds of Japanese animes inspired directly from ""Blade Runner.""  One need only look at something like ""Ghost In The Shell 2"" to see the direct inspiration.

The soundtrack from Vangelis also draws you into this deep work of art.

109964,5,0790729628,"I watched The Director's Cut again (haven't watched it in a couple of years), and it is still a stunning movie for something made 24 years ago. Something I complain about with the first two Star Wars movies is not just the the dialouge feeling a bit forced, but the visuals, as cool as they look, lack the ""grit"" that was more evident in the original trilogy, and especially in this movie. Designing the bowels of Coruscant, they should've taken a cue from what a city should REALLY look like by watching this one.

Anyways, back to Blade Runner, the removal of Harrison Ford's narration was much better to me. I felt when I saw the original back in the day, his narration seemed like it was more in-the-way than being helpful. Also, the removal of the ""happy ending"" made it much more open-ended, and more wide open to speculation. As for the possibility that Deckard was a replicant, Phillip K. Dick's book seems to stir up that speculation, without ever really answering it...even now, it's still subject for debate. That the influence of the book/movie to cyberpunk books/movies is apparent: individual vs. the system, whether it's Deckard working outside the system (ex-cop), or the Repllicants that are renegades outside of the system. The movie also has that detective/film noir feel, set in a futuristic, but bleak, setting.

I recently read that because of legal issues, the movie hasn't been given the ""Special Edition"" treatment, which is a shame. I'd like to see both the original theatrical release, and see the D.C. version, and see how much different the two movies are. The film quality is in need of cleaning up (graininess here and there), and an improvement of the sound quality to digital couldn't hurt. But, even now though, this movie was certainly ahead of it's genre, and still looks decent today.",1094256000,4,1821,4.814696485623003
109965,4,0790729628,"...all time.  And a good private eye story to boot.  Like Spenser, Deckard gets way too involved with a case (see the novel, ""A Savage Place"") and pays for it.

Secondly, much was made about this movie giving ""hints"" that Deckard was a replicant.  The only one, and it's a slender one at that, is when Rachael asks him if he's ever taken the replicant diagnostic ""test.""  He avoids the question.  THAT's supposed to be the hint he's a replicant?  Perhaps the rumored (and I notice the rumors are a year old and no three disk set has appeared; of course Ridley Scott's been busy...) three disk set will shed more light on this.

The influence of this film's look is most easily found in the ""Matrix"" triology.  Unfortunately, the Wachowski brother's homage was a little too slavish and it's easy to confuse some of the exterior shots because of this.  (Especially Neo's first meeting with Morpheus; tell me that the exterior of the building couldn't have been cut from the exteriors of the J.F. Sebastian character's apt. building!)

Digression aside...I saw this movie in the theater when it was released in 1983, when I was twelve.  I remember it having a huge effect on me as a science fiction fan and a movie lover.

I don't buy that the ""original"" release had a happy ending.  Neither the ""noir"" nor the Private Eye genres (much as they overlap) demands an ""unhappy"" ending.

All the original ending did was show you what would have logically happened when Deckard and Rachael left his apt--they would have escaped!  To call the priginal ending the ""happy"" one and this one whose ending is the movie with them in the elevator is the ""properly"" sad one, is both purile and irrelevant.

What do you think he would have done with her?  Taken her to Bryant?

Two things that this movie left incomplete: the original completed the hint given by Deckard regarding Rachael's ""expiration"" date in this one (it's in the ""narration"" eliminated for this version by Scott).  When she inquired, he evaded the question with, ""That's classified.""  That's the ""big"" hint?

The removal of the narration was also jarring.  I thought I had screwed up burning my archive copy (perfectly legal as we all know) and missed an audio subchannel.  Nope.

It somehow feels like something's missing.  I think the movie should get a B+, but since we can't give letter grades or -/+'s, I'll still leave at four stars.

The outdoor scenes are still spectacular.  If the scare about America ""turning Japanese"" (those of you who are dry behind the ears will get the song reference) so prominently displayed in both versions seems dated, that's because it is.  It's American culture and power that dominates, not Japanese.  So, Scott got that completely wrong.

Also removed is Philip K. Dick's credit; the movie's based on his short novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.""  Very odd.  I remember the ""novelization"" has his name and the old title prominently displayed.

But all the basic things that made this an sf classic are still there.  It's still beautiful, the character of Deckard is still compellingly drawn and Shawn Young is still meltingly goregous  (second film crush after Lt. Saavik!).  I couldn't help but simply stare at her face.

The criticism of both the audio and video transfers is wildly exaggerated.  I viewed this on both my TV, even with 2.0 Audio  the VanGelis soundtrack sounds awe-inspiring.  The transfer is decent.  (If it looks good with a 64MB video card, it'll look good on your high end TV--which doesn't have the resolution of my monitor anyway.) It could have been a lot worse and it's a lot better than some transfers of movies that have come out a lot more recently.

It's too bad the original version is no longer available.  I may have it on an old VHS tape somewhere (let the critics of the transfer watch that and see if they still complain!).  I hope so.  The comparison would be interesting.

To reiterate, the criticisms expressed by the editorial reviewer and several fans are silly and little import.  The core story is intact and the narration really wasn't needed.  We just expect to hear it (especially those of us who watched it a gazillion times as a teenager on HBO), so the absence of it is, as I said, jarring.

Whether a ""newbie"" to the film or your first time seeing it on DVD, this movie, it's star (and, to clear things up, Mr. Ford is a ""star"" not an actor) and director achieved something unique; whose influence has echoed thru sf and film for over twenty years now.

If for no other reason, kind of like listening to Hendrix even if acid rock ain't your thing, you should watch it to understand how Scott changed sf films and cinematography in general.

Pro: same great story, etc

Cons: lack of any commentaries or extras of any kind

Big Con: as one fan already noted, there was no reason not to have made a ""flipper"" (since dual layers weren't available when DVD first appeared but I may be wrong about that) with the original on one side and the DC on the other.

But those are gentle bitches.  It still takes your breath away and still leaves you uncomfortable with Scott's dystopic nightmare.  As with all great sf, we are left asking ourselves,  how much of this future is in OUR future?",1093910400,9,5234,4.65792349726776
109966,5,0790729628,"Maybe the problem with this movie when it came out, back in the early 80s, wasn't so much the voice over narration or the faux happy ending. Casting Harrison Ford was the blunder, because this movie was made straight after the high of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, so everybody was like ""Han Solo / Indiana Jones having his sorry behind wacked so bad? I won't buy it"". Of couse, in time Harison Ford established himself as one of the greatest  actors, and then the movie made sence.

While Harrison Ford's narration has its weaknesses, it clarifies the story and keeps the viewer ""tuned in."" Without it, I think the movie gets a bit confusing without repeated viewing and without the knowledge the original narration communicated.

I believe the editorial review to be incorrect.  At the time of the Director's Cut release, Ridley Scott acknowledged that the original release of the movie had his approval and that he had added the narration because he felt moviegoers would not understand the movie very well.  I don't believe this is a case where the studio executives ""stole"" the picture from the director and forced their own changes.",1093478400,6,801,4.962686567164179

Decker is a police detective in charge of 'retiring' derelict replicants: human androids manufactured by Tyrell Corp.  His new assignment is to track down several replicants on a killing spree against certain Tyrell Corp. employees.  What's their motive?  Can they be stopped?  What will Decker find out when he does stop them?

This is a great film with various themes.  The plot is more along the lines of your standard detective film.  The acting talents of Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer, and M. Emmet Walsh, are complemented by the great directing skills of Ridley Scott.

109971,3,0790729628,"I think that I am still relatively safe in saying that Blade Runner is one of the most prolific and inspired sci-fi movies of all time. But there are still several qualms that many people, myself included, have with the DVD release. First of all, the sound and video transfer flat out suck. There is no 5.1 sound, and as for the video, well, that's just because no archival negative has ever been made, so what you see is what you get. Secondly, the only version of the film that you can get on DVD format is the ""Director's Cut"", which is just a hurried fix-up from the original. Ridley Scott even said himself that he wasn't totally happy with this version, but it met his basic artistic vision of the film. Lastly, there are not special features except for a crappy cast and crew synopsis.

 Okay, so before you start to think that I'm totally blasting the film, hold on. The true version of this film is yet to be seen by anyone. According to Scott and Warner Bros., a three-disk, definitive version of Blade Runner is supposed to be released. Contained will be all the different versions of the film, including a new version which Scott has painstakingly digitally re-edited and reworked. It's not the original, it's not the director's cut, but it's just simply, ""Blade Runner"". Also included in the ""Blade Runner: Special Edition"" will be loads of extras, including interviews and documetaries. This is the true version of the movie, the version that should be viewed by the masses. One problem though. Legal struggles between Scott, Warner Bros., and the ""Blade Runner Partnership"" have made the release of this version all but certain. Scott has already done the work, and Warner Bros. is ready to distribute, but Jerry Perenchio of the ""Partnership"" seems less than thrilled to let Scott have his way.

 So, my advice is to hold out until the ""Special Edition"" comes out. I know, who knows when that will be, but trust me, if you are a fan of Blade Runner, you will only be doing yourself a favor by waiting.",1091664000,18,2017,4.625698324022347
109972,5,0790729628,"The movie itself is a materpiece of cinematography. I remember watching it as a kid of 11 and just being in awe of how awful a place LA was made out to be and how true its decline seemed.  In the movie, LA seemed to have been overrun by an Asian population, was in an utter state of decay, and everything was dark because you couldn't see the sun for all the smog and rain. Perhaps this is what it will look like in the far future when we get to the point where we can live on other worlds. People will leave the Earth in droves and head for other planets, just like today people leave the inner city and flock to the suburbs.

  The DVD itself is lacking, what with 2.0 sound instead of 5.1 and what looks like a lasterdic transfer. The movie itself more than makes up for it. Here's to hoping Ridley Scott gets to make a definitive version of his movie before he dies if the fool at Univision who owns this film ever lets him.

** Here be spoilers ***

 Reasons why the Director's Cut is better in my opinion:

 1) No cheesy voiceover. If you need a voiceover to figure out what's going on, just watch it again and pay attention.

 2) No cheesy happy ending. It's enough of a happy ending that Deckard leaves with Rachael at the end.

 3) Removed gore for gore's sake. I don't need to see Tyrell's eyes being gouged out, thank you, in order to figure out what awful thing is going on. You can form your own mental image of what's happening as Rutger Hauer's sweaty face shakes and contorts from inhuman exertion while Tyrell screams.

 4) The unicorn. Ridley may not have intended for Deckard to be a replicant at its original release, and it may not even be be the unicorn scene that was shot for Blade Runner, but it is a thought-provoking concept. Deckard believes he is a human with as much conviction as Rachael did, except nobody has told him otherwise. Likewise, he has no reason to believe otherwise because he has memories - albeit artificial - to backup his sense that he is human.

How does anyone know they're human when science and technology reach the level that they are in Blade Runner?  Memories?  The fact that you look and act like everyone else?  You can't be certain.",1090627200,2,2190,4.323529411764706

So many people are claiming that Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a replicant.  Well, if you want to rewrite the story then be my guest.  Considering that Tyrell, who created these replicants, pointed out to Deckard that: ""Rachael is an experiment.  Nothing more.""
Now, how can Deckard not know that he is not a replicant if he was around way before Rachael even existed?  You are making Deckard a very far advance replicant compare to the others including Rachael.
I am watching the DVD version of Blade Runner at the same time I am typing this letter.  Memories are the main factor here.  The previous versions of replicant do not have memories of their childhood like Deckard does.  Rachael is an experiment.  She the first replicant to have memories!  Now, why would Tyrell, knowing that Deckard is an replicant lie about Rachael?  Tyrell didn't lie to Roy right before Roy killed him so why would Tyrell lie to Deckard?

109980,5,0790729628,"Nobody likes the theatrical release, so get over it.  Ridley Scott couldn't ever get over how the studio treated this film, and 11 years later, he finally got his wish.  Every allusion to Deckard being a replicant was removed in the theatrical release, and the ridiculous voice-over narration was added to help the flow that Scott worked so hard to craft himself.  The happy ending was replaced with one of the best endings I've ever seen.  Thing is, the movie is so subtle, that most people don't ever really realize that Deckard is a replicant until someone else tells them.  Then they become obsessed with how and why they missed it.  They go back and watch it over and over looking for all the clues Ridley Scott left for them.  That's one of the things that's so brilliant about this film, it places you as the detective.
The clues:
1-Listen closely to Deckard's debriefing near the beginning.  He was told that six replicants hijacked the cargo ship.  Four escaped and one was killed.  The fate of number six was never explained.
2-The photo from Leon's apartment that Deckard analyzes contains a blurred image of a man that is sitting in the same position that Deckard is at that very moment.  Possibly hinting that Deckard was an associate of Leon's.
3-Speaking of photos, we know that replicants collect photos to confirm their existence....Deckard had an incredible amount of antique photos scattered about his apartment.
4-Deckard dreams of an unicorn while slumped over his piano.  Possibly a memory....at the end of the movie, Detective Gaff leaves Deckard an origami unicorn.  How did he know of the unicorn dream?  Because he's aware of all of Deckard's implanted memories.  This also shows that not only was Gaff there as Rachel slept (he was supposed to kill her) but he reveals to Deckard that he's aware of his true nature.  And Gaff, of course, let's them both go.
There are still some people that reject these clues, claiming that it's the wishful thinking of movie geeks.  But Ridley Scott himself confirmed that Deckard is a replicant.  In an interview with the BBC while promoting Blade Runner- Director's Cut, Scott explained all the details behind Deckard's true nature, and explained the studio execs that removed most of the clues did so because they couldn't follow the story.  Even though it was his biggest box office failure, Ridley Scott still considers his Director's Cut edition of Blade Runner his greatest film.  I'd have to agree.",1087948800,7,2468,4.858851674641149
109981,3,0790729628,"Of course, in the DVD format, there is no reason there should not be a director's cut release. But there are legitimate reasons that people might prefer the theatrical version. I  found the director's cut to be flat without Ford's ironic noir-style narration. A lot of the classic lines from the film are from the voiceover narration, which does not appear in the director's cut.
And personally, I don't feel the original ending was a ""Hollywood happy ending"" either. They are driving off into the wild blue. Whether Rachel lives 100 years or 4 years, it is not going to be a bowl of cherries. That's just the point. Deckard didn't know how long she would live, or how long he would live. That's life. And now they are fugitives. This is a happy ending?
For me, Deckard was not an android and never will be. He was a crotchety, burned-out human blade runner who fell in love with an android.
So I will add my voice to the chorus of people begging for a proper DVD release of the theatrical version. There is no excuse for its unavailability. The public should have its choice, just as it did in VHS. I personally own the laserdisc release of the theatrical version, and visually the mastering is not that great. We need the DVD.

109982,5,0790729628,"By the time Roy Batty dies, he has made peace with his engineered fate, that his manufactured four-year lifespan was ending.  Upon relinguishing his life, Batty releases the dove he had been clutching, his soulful metaphor, which escapes into the gray sky.  The implication is that Batty's compassion for Deckard manifested his humanity, and thus earned him an afterlife.  It was a poetically masterful conclusion to a cinematic masterpiece of science fiction.  Most fans of science fiction will agree that this is one fine film, proof of what can be done with the genre when it's taken seriously, as something that can appeal to grownups.  About that, we can pretty much concur.  The contention begins when we discuss which version is better: The original theatrical release, or this Director's Cut.  Look at some of these other reviews and you'll see what I mean.

The theatrical version is now out of print (it was on VHS).  I have it and I've seen it countless times.  I also have this Director's Cut DVD, and I've seen it countless times, too.  What some of the other reviewers have failed to mention, or have glossed over without explanation, is HOW the two versions differ.  First, the noir-like voice-over is omitted in the Director's Cut, as was Deckard's fly-away escape with Rachel, the final scene in the original.  Second, there is an added scene in which Deckard falls asleep at his piano and dreams of a unicorn running through a verdant wilderness.  Though they seem minor changes, these omissions and additions change the movie to the degree that the two versions are entirely different films.  In the original, Deckard's and Rachel's escape implies their living happily ever after.  In the Director's Cut, Deckard himself is a replicant, he and Rachel both doomed by the four-year lifespan.  To fans of the original film, the conclusion of the Director's Cut is hard to swallow.  I know: I was one of them, and when I first viewed the Director's Cut, I didn't even see what is now glaringly obvious.  Viewing the original edition so often had biased my perceptions; I simply couldn't see it in any way other than how I initially interpreted it.  But via discussions in the Blade Runner newsgroup I came to think and accept otherwise.  Deckard was a replicant.  The proof is distilled from three points: Deckard's dream of the unicorn; the memories implanted by the replicants' manufacturers into the minds of the replicants to give them a sense of an extended lifespan; and the final origami -- a unicorn -- discovered by Deckard as he and Rachel escape.  There are other clues, for sure, but these cinch it: Deckard's dream was known to someone besides himself, just as he had known Rachel's private memories in detail, because they orginally belonged to Tyrell's niece.  After a period of adjustment, I've come to prefer the Director's Cut.  It's a more nuanced film.  Also, this is truer to the director's vision, and that's a good thing in this case, like a mistake corrected.  It's less happy-ending Hollywood.  I haven't watched the original version since I bought this DVD.

As for the DVD itself, it's a two-sided disc, with a widescreen presentation on one side and fullscreen on the other.  The image quality is superior to that of the VHS edition, of course.  The yearning soundtrack by Vangelis, so integrated into the whole experience, is enhanced by the digital rendering.  For DVD extras, there's not much here in the form of special features -- ""production notes"" the only real extra, stuff you read; not really that special -- but for now, this is the only available edition of this great film.  And it's more than enough, if you love films by directors with visionary ambition.

On a hopeful note for those of you favoring the original theatrical release, I understand there's a special edition DVD package planned that'll include both versions of the film, both digitally corrected in a couple of spots -- those of us cult-like aficionados are painfully aware of some glaring continuity errors -- along with a few other goodies as extras (REAL extras, such as a director's commentary).  But there's no official release date as of yet.  For now, if you don't have the original release on VHS you're tough out of luck.  But having to settle for this Director's Cut isn't a bad deal: It's as close to the director's original vision as you'll get for now.",1087257600,16,4388,4.841610738255033

The dark, cloudy and contaminated atmosphere , and the two billions towers surrounded of that claustrophobic gothic landscape persuades you something bad about to happen. This magnificent set inspired Tim Burton in Batman 1.
Harrison Ford is a police hired to kill an extraordinary generation of replicants , humanoids whose mission is to make the dirty work and gifted of emotive memories, but built to live just four years , who have decided to rebel.
In this frenetical search, Ford falls in love with one of them (Sean Young) and he must exterminate the other three.

Poignant moments in the romantic scenes and unforgettable sequences of splendid kinetic energy as the brilliant coreography fight against Darryl Hannah in the room of toys.
That ending climax final and the last dialogue Hauger-Ford are from its release in 1982 a classic.
The soundtrack from Vangelis is another important factor that adds aditional dramatic effect to the film.

I loved this movie when I first saw it and I find it wonderful to notice in the background the company logos (which at the time were powerful up and coming companies) of which most are out of business (though Atari has made a comeback).  The soundtrack sets the tone and the weather (which it always is raining in the film except for the very ending) also keep things looking bleak.  I do enjoy the directors cut cause I am a big fan of Widescreen... but that is the only reason I like it.  I wish they had kept the narration (or at least had a two sided disk so a person could chose to have the original unedited narration or the directors cut version).  I know some people think the narration is the studios way of saying that the audiance cannot understand the film without dumbing-it-down with narration.  This is definitily not the case.  The narration reminds me of those old TV Cop dramas where the cops thoughts are always stated as the action is happening.  I do feel that it adds to the film.

One screenwriter brought up an excellent point, that we've all heard the narration before, so our mind automatically fills in the blanks when we watch the movie without it.

It is a thinking persons movie because it doesn't leave all the questions answered. Is Sean Young a Replicant? Is Harrison Ford a Replicant? Is there a secondary or tertiary meaning in Rutger Hauer's escaped Replicant that is not dissimilar to Pierre Boulle's ""Planet of the Apes?""
That Ford argued with Scott on the emphasis of ""to be or not to be"" regarding his role as a/the 'blade runner' along with the silly voiceover about which art regrettably had to bow to money has given the story of the movie almost as much interest as the story.

109991,5,0790729628,"Ridley Scott is a director among the highest caliber and I have been a fan of his for quite some time.  I love the original ""Alien"" and his fantasy film ""Legend.""  ""Gladiator"" was another good film with a strong visual sense with rich performances (especially by Oliver Reed, in his final role) and grand production design.  For some strange reason, I hadn't seen ""Blade Runner"" until this year.  It's a film that didn't do particularly well upon its release in 1982 (especially since the director's cut is ten times better), but has had a cult following since then.  Hell, I'm a fan of cult films, too.  As you might have come across my ""Dragonslayer"" review, I love a film because the film is good, not because it won so many academy awards.
Anyways, ""Blade Runner"" is set in the 21st century in a bleak Los Angeles.  By this time, there are several Earth colonies and mankind has ventured forth with only the poor and the helpless staying behind on Earth.  Mankind also invented ""replicants,"" machines made to look human and only have a four-year lifespan.  Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a ""blade runner"" (assigned to terminate replicants) who must battle with four replicants (played by Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, and Joanna Cassidy) who have killed an entire ship and escaped to Earth.  Rutger Hauer plays their leader and the so-called ""prodigal son"" that was meant to be the toughest replicant.  Deckard discovers another one named Rachael (Sean Young) that is VERY close to being human (in other words, she can't be detected easily.  She required 100+ tests to figure out if she was a replicant.).  Deckard does as he is ordered, but finds himself falling for Rachael, and the other replicants simply went back to Earth to increase their longevity.
The film has an OUTSTANDING visual style, but that is to be expected of Ridley Scott.  I loved his fantasy look for ""Legend"" and here he brings out not your every day-sunny day California.  This is bleak, dark, and very much in the film-noir fashion.  Plus, the music score by the great Vangelis (""Chariots of Fire"") is excellent, with melodic saxophone moments and at other times in a hyperdrive electronic fashion like the end titles.  The only thing I could 'probably' degrade the film for is that you find yourself not connecting with the characters.  The best way to describe them is that they're vague.  Then again, the film's focus is not entirely on the characters.
At first, I found myself with a lot of people (including Leonard Maltin, who I think misses the point...) who didn't like the film because it was hard to follow.  After watching it a second time, I caught on more of what it was about.  It's a movie that'll take some growing used to (it has a brooding pace that might not be appealing to today's viewers who are used to ""cut, cut, cut"" action).
Do I recommend this?  While I found myself loving the film in the end, it's not one to instantly get into.  The deep philosophical notion here is that life is precious, and we humans tend to see humanity in ONLY humanity.  Here, we have a lot of people, not just replicants, who are poor, hungry, handicapped, and what the like.  Humanity's disservice to humanity, and even the replicants have humanity in them (near the end, Rutger Hauer gives a very compelling speech about his own death.).  Once I figured out the message of the film, I loved it all the more.  To the sci-fi enthusiast, I definitely recommend it.  Others might not have any desire to see it.  On the other hand, I highly recommend that a second viewing be applied, for it took me two viewings to analyze it.
PROS: Grand visual style, Compelling story and message, Excellent music score, Astonishing production design, Dark ending.
CONS: Characters are somewhat undefined, Film requires two or more viewings which might turn off the casual viewer.
To sum it all up, this is a great art film that must be seen to believed.  Watch with care; you might dislike it at first, but it'll grow on you the second time around.",1082678400,3,4032,4.694167852062589

Dick story about androids doing the risky or unwanted jobs in society and what to do with them when their job is done. The answer is to use a type of cop called a Blade Runner to destroy them. Harrison Ford, in a nice but somewhat misunderstood role, is the Blade Runner.
I have three versions of this film on laser disc. The first is the theatrical version, the second was an extended version with about twenty minutes added, and the third is the shorter directors cut. This DVD version is the director's cut.
The directors cut is a tightened version with the voice over and the extended ending removed; the theatrical and the extended version are the versions with voice over by Harrison Ford and with the added ending that some call happy. It is the voice over and the so called happy ending that some find objectionable. My favorite of the three is the extended version with the voice over. The happy ending I did not see as especially happy and could take or leave. But all versions a superior science fiction and all are worth your time. A boxed set of all versions would have been nice and perhaps some day we will see that boxed set available. In the meantime enjoy Ridley Scott's favorite cut and maybe someday pick up the voice over version.

Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is definitely my favorite character and he brings the whole DVD together, summing up the story with his line ""I want more life."" He was able to say things that were meant to be creepy and menacing, but that actually made me laugh, particularly when he yelled ""That hurt!"" to Deckard, who hit Batty in the head twice with a metal beam.

The film itself is generally accepted by many to be one of the greatest Science Fiction movies of all time. It was indeed a film before it's time and was not well accepted by audiences of the day. It has taken on more relevance now after the technological explosion of the 90s and it's legacy still echos in Hollywood 20 years later.
Blade Runner is a drama set in a future LA showing the struggles to survive in the oppressive technological environment of the near future. The film at it's core asks the question what is human and is it just our DNA that makes us so? I think this struggle and questions asked in the movie are becoming more and more relevant in our daily lives as we ride the explosive growth of technology over the last 20 years. I can relate in my personal life to a much greater degree to Blade Runner than any other Sci-Fi movie before or since. This is a shame that Hollywood has not done a better job raising the genre of Sci-Fi above the level of juvenile level of spaceships, aliens, and CGI effects. I think Sci-Fi can be so much more than just space ships and aliens and can teach us about ourselves by placing humans in unusual/future environments (as does Blade Runner) Granted, maybe because I work in a technical field and use a computer at least 8 hours a day Blade Runner is more compelling for me. Blade Runner has such a strong impact to me emotionally and at the same time it has a very good plot that includes, action, romance, intrigue, and life and death struggles of almost all the principle characters and their evolution as human beings.
This is a fascinating movie which can be watched more than once, unlike most movies in my collection which I have watched but once or twice max and have no desire to watch again for a long long time.
Blade Runner is an intriguing and stunning prediction of the human race's future. Will technology steal our humanity as we lose ourselves in the world of machines??? Time will tell if Blade Runner is correct in that prediction.",1075939200,,2293,4.448931116389549

Not to the point where I can tell you the name of the chick's aunt who played Cordelia's third stake in Episode 4,000,258 B of Buffy, but I like the genre just the same, and some of my all-time favourite flicks (Star Wars, Alien, The Fifth Element) are true-blue Science Fiction.
Imagine my disappointment, then, upon renting this Director's cut version of Blade Runner, and discovering that not only is it one of the most boring Sci-Fi movies ever made, it's also pretentious and overstated to the point where you really don't care if you never see the end.
With a potentially excellent premise - the plot, on paper, is exciting and detailed) and a decent ensemble cast (with Sean Young doing what she seems to do best, playing emotionless characters), Ridley Scott and Vangelis manage to totally negate any character sympathy we might feel through over-the-top panorama shots, long, drawn-out cityscape sequences, and the most awfully Eighties-Fantastic soundtrack ever.  Cliches like the Bar sequence abound, and are we really expected to believe Daryl Hannah in her role as the grating, whiney Pris? At least Splash was mute for a part of that movie...
One of the most annoying features of this film is the performance given by the usually excellent Harrison Ford. I can imagine Ridley Scott telling Ford to play the role as Indiana Jones-without-Humanity, and that's exactly how he comes across. Boring and wooden, as the central character in a movie whose basic premise is the conflict between humanity and machines, his character is the major flaw in a film full of boring, OTT cliches and unengaging dialogue.

The actual difference in footage amounts to something like 7 seconds - big woop.  The only significant change is the loss of monologue:  a major mistake. The director was miffed at the studios for forcing the issue, and now, decades later, the release of the ""restored"" version has all but supplanted the original.  It's impossible to get a hold of - the die hard fans, not content to be told which version to like, seek out the theatrical release as if it were a rare truffle.  I would call the monologues effectiveness a happy accident.  In an interview, Ford disclosed that he agreed with the director.  He didn't want to do the voice-over.  As a result, he read the part as deadpan, monotone as he could, attempting to bore the studio into dropping it.  The way it turned out, the reading fit perfectly.  For one thing, it gave the movie a voice similar to that of classic detective dramas (something reflected in the sets and costumes, as well).  For another, it reflected how dead and empty the main character felt inside - whether that was because he was a killer, a washed up cop, a failure as a husband, or just possibly a replicant with a flimsy emotional crutch imprinted on his memory, didn't matter.  Ford's intended sabotage made the character.  Without sharing our hero's thoughts, the movie feels disjointed and comes across as annoying.

Classic film noire often needs narration. Even if Ford initially narrated poorly on purpose, it kind of fits in with the character.  Besides which, the D Cut does nothing to replace the narration, so there are great gobs of panoramic dead air, with maybe a bit of background music.  It becomes a struggle to stay focused. I tested this with two of my Media Studies sections, and the narration kept the most audience attention hands down, not to mention a keener grasp of the film.

Is our existance the result of our personal choices or are we being moved along by forces beyond our control?  Seems sort of hokey when you're reading it off a screen, but when you experience it lived out on film, it is truly a beautiful sight.  From what I hear about the director's cut is that the film's narration has been omitted and the movie's ending has been altered.  I've read through Deckard's voice over from the theatrical release, and believe me, you don't need it.  The Director's Cut works much better to subtly convey the emotions and themes of the movie.  A quick comment on the ending without spoiling it... it works.  If you truly let the movie engross you, you'll understand why any other ending would be a disappointment.  It's powerful without being preachy.  Science fiction at it's best.
A few warnings to DVD buffs and Blade Runner fans.  This isn't a good DVD.  The video and sound quality is nothing special.  The world Ridley Scott creates is amazing.  The DVD just doesn't do it justice.  No extras, no easter eggs, nothing.  Quite a disappointment.  The movie is based from the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.""

Then again, if you've read the book, you know that it just wouldn't have worked as a perfect transition into a movie.

This movie is based on the novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"" (1968) by Philip K. Dick.

The plot of this movie (original theatrical release in 1982) is simple.  Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a policeman, in this movie's case a ""blade runner,"" of Los Angeles (in the year 2019) who's after four criminals, in this case genetically-made criminal ""replicants"" named Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), and Leon (Brion James).  Deckard accidentally develops a romance with the more sophisticated replicant Rachael (Sean Young).

I watched this movie (""The Director's Cut"") with a friend who did not see the original release that had Deckard's voice-over narration.  Guess what?  My friend could not follow the story!!!!  I could since I'd seen the original release but I found that I still missed Deckard's voice-over.

I especially missed the voice-over when the Roy Batty replicant ""dies"" at the end of the movie.  This scene was not as emotionally appealing with the voice-over absent.

I think I deduced the reasons why the voice-over is so important for this movie:

(1) It allows the viewer to follow the action.
(2) It provides the human touch to counterbalance all the technological and visually-stunning special effects.
(3) It adds a ""retro"" feel that reminded me of old-time detective movies.

The ending of the the director's cut movie, I felt, was too abrupt.  The original release gave a feeling of hope that Deckard and the replicant Rachael would have a future together.

The special effects that highlight the steel-and-microchip jungle of twenty-first century L.A. and the background music provided by Vangelis are still fantastic and exhilarating.

BOTTOM LINE:

Without the voice-over narration, this movie (The Director's Cut) loses its magnificence and emotional impact.

RECOMMENDATION:

Get the original 1982 theatrical version with Deckard's voice-over narration on DVD.  (This version is easily a five star movie.)

But I still have my original un-rated Embassy Home video unedited VHS version from 1986, which I regard as precious and sacred. And it's starting to seriously deteriorate.

110013,4,0790729628,"The prologue begins, ""Early in the 21st century, the Tyrell Corp. advanced robot evolution into the Nexus phase-a being virtually identical to a human-known as a Replicant. The Nexus 6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence to the genetic engineers who created them"".
They are used as slave labor for dangerous work in Off-world colonies. Their design does not include human emotions, however, it seems there's a glitch. After several years a Replicant may develop emotional responses which could lead to resentment of their slave status and rebellious behavior. So a fail-safe is built in; a 4 year life span. When a Nexus 6 combat team stages a bloody mutiny in an Off-world colony, Replicants are declared illegal on Earth - under penalty of death.  Harrison Ford stars as Deckard, a retired Blade Runner, the name given to police assigned to exterminate renegade Replicants.  He's coaxed out of retirement to hunt down an especially crafty and brutal group lead by Roy (Rutger Hauer), that has returned to Earth in search of their creator to demand longer life. During Deckard's investigation, he encounters Rachel (Sean Young), an experimental Replicant that's been given an entire past of artificial memories; parents, a childhood, etc. Rachel doesn't know she's a Replicant and Deckard finds himself emotionally drawn to her, even protective of her. He struggles to make sense of the feelings he has for this ""thing"". Clearly at issue are the moral implications of man's pursuit to manipulate the stuff of life, to become a sort of ""God of biomechanics"", and how that affects our concept of humanity.
Director Scott has created a bizzare and visually stunning landscape that earned Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects and Art Direction.  In this sci-fi noir, the mood is perpetually dark, cold and damp.  Advanced technology contrasts with gothic architecture and urban decay. Ford is great as a burned out Philip Marlow type; Hauer is ultra-cool and menacing with his Aryan features, white hair and black leather. The Director's Cut DVD includes a less upbeat ending than the theatrical release, eliminates Deckard's voice-over and adds a sequence in which Deckard dreams of a unicorn.
I greatly admire most of Ridley Scott's work and I own this DVD because it's one of my favorite sci-fi films. However, it's not without it's problems. It was adapted from the classic 1968 sci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"". Perhaps in the heat of the space race it seemed logical that we would explore and colonize other worlds by the early 21st century. But by the time this film was made, the screenwriter should have known that such a scenario was implausible. The unicorn dream is supposed to suggest that Deckard is questioning his own humanity and wondering whether he too may be a Replicant, but how is a viewer unfamiliar with the book supposed to know that? It's an intriguing element that I wish had been communicated and explored. Also, the nature of a Replicant is unclear. It obviously is not a robot in the conventional sense, since genetic engineering is involved. It's ""a being virtually identical to a human"", but it's not a genetically altered clone; a clone with a 4 year life span would die as a 4 yr. old child. That we would be creating living ""robots"" of flesh and blood in the early 21st century is an even more absurd prediction that space colonization. So, when I watch the film, I pretend the prologue says ""23rd century"", then I can just enjoy the director's artistic vision and the thought-provoking story. I eagerly await the new, remastered 5.1 Dolby version reportedly in the works.",1069545600,2,3695,4.964458804523425
110014,5,0790729628,"This visually stunning sci-fi cult classic is one of my all time favorite films. I too agree with a previous reviewer who said the original theatrical release was better, even if it had the monotonous dead panned sounding narrative by Harrison Ford. That narrative is what really gave this futuristic cop film its retro-noirish feel (Humphrey Bogart style). As for the ""happy"" or ""uplifiting"" ending, who said that it really is a happy ending; remember the narrative closing lines that Deckard gives about not knowing how long the replicant Rachel has to live? Also, you now have an ending with a cop on the run with a runaway replicant. So, the bleak question is how long do they both have before someone or something catches up to them?... Seeing the director's cut where the elevator doors in the end just close to the credits rolling to me implied an easy way out for the director or film editor to get out of completing the story or film somehow. While artistically it was a nice segueing blackout fade for the credits to roll it did nothing to improve or add to the film. When I saw the unicorn dream sequence it felt very out of place. Albeit the reason we now know that Scott added it was to give the sense that Deckard too was a replicant. However, whose to say that the unicorn in his head was not a thought or memory that he too knew replicants had as part of their memory implants ? Maybe he was just remembering or dreaming about what he also knew could be in a replicant's mind. After all, he knew about the spider memory he tells Rachel about and Rachel completes the memory in the dialogue.
The point is is that Blade Runner, whether Director's Cut version or original theatrical version is better than the other one thing remains; Blade Runner was and is the pinnacle of using small scale models when computer graphics had not been the norm yet. Music by Vangelis is also another powerful artisitic catalyst that makes Blade Runner that much more captivating and timeless !",1069459200,4,1990,4.57703081232493
110015,4,0790729628,"I know most of the published reviews said the directors cut was better than the original, but I beg to differ.  If I hadn't seen the original, I would have been much more lost about what was going on in the diretors cut.  I liked the ""corny"" voice overs that other reviewers complained about, which DID help you understand what was going on better.  I also liked the ""happy ending"" from the original.  It was such a dark movie otherwise, I thought the happy ending gave hope about the future instead of the more pessemistic view of the directors cut version.  I thought the unicorn scene from the directors cut added absolutely nothing to the original story, I didn't see the point of putting it in there.  If something isn't broken, don't fix it.

110016,5,0790729628,"The movie bares hardly any resemblance to the book on which it's supposed to be based upon, which is not too bad, because  I didn't like the book (""Do androids dream of electric sheep?"").
Also, I saw the director's cut when it came on the screen and I like the studio's cut better. Once you see ""Blade Runner"" and naturally admire the director's achievement, it's tempting to take his side on this issue and on any other he likes, but this is what I felt after having seen both versions. The unicorn scene is a lovely piece of visual poetry, but it adds nothing to the film. It just seems out of place and de trop.
Harrison Ford's narration did add a great deal, though, and it's a waste to see the movie without it. I don't care if Harrison tried to botch it up: the jaded, tough Phillip Marlowe rendition works. In Humphrey Bogart's detective movies (my all time absolute favorite actor) you can see how the two characters share the same tough but secretly vulnerable persona. There's even a scene when Ford pretends he's a nerdy, sexually neutered jerk to get informations, that makes me wonder if it might not have been inspired by a scene from ""The Big Sleep"" - a twist, by the way, that was invented by Bogart himself.
I think here one sees Harrison Ford at his best. I'm sorry to see his acting skills deteriorating more and more with age, and it adds to the melancholic experience of watching this film to know that he's never been in such a great movie, or ever acted that wonderfully again, except in ""Frenetic"", by Roman Polanski.
Another spoiler was an interview with Sean Young that I once read, where she denounced how badly she and Harrison Ford got along on the set. The love scene, that I always thought was so electrifying, does nothing for me now, thanks to her. She said Harrison actually did throw her violently against the window for real, and that those tears one sees her cry aren't the tears of the cracks in her character's armor showing, but of her real and actual physical pain.
Nevertheless, it's still a mind-blowing experience. I'm not objective enough about this work to be able to tell if it's dated or not - I hope it isn't. I suppose one could say ""Casablanca""'s dated, but it's beyond that thanks to its timeless quality. The same, I hope, could be said of this work.
The beauty of the movie (the sets, the clothes, the lighting, the make-up, the music by Vangelis of course) is unbeatable.
There are so many details I love about it: the city, the geisha add, Sean Young's entrance, Harrison Ford's character remembering how his wife used to call him sushi (cold fish), Daryl Hannah's acrobatics and eye make-up, Rutger Hauer's coolness, the hunger for life only the dying can experience, its slick dirtiness and tragedy.",1068854400,,2757,4.580971659919029
110017,5,0790729628,"One of the few science fiction films in the last 20 years to rival Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is Steven Spielberg's 2003 effort Minority Report. Guess what: they're both adaptations of stories by Phillip K Dick.
I think Minority Report is in large part homage to Blade Runner (as is the Matrix, actually): the futuristic city, transport and all pervasive advertising is all there, but Spielberg (whilst making an undeniably wonderful film) hasn't mustered anything like the design, style or brooding atmosphere of Blade Runner: Scott's use of backlight (used to great effect in picking out the retinas of the replicants and - ha - Deckard) and constantly swishing spotlights, invading and infusing ones privacy through venetian blinds and grilles, holes and apretures, creates a real sense of resigned paranoia.
It's hardly a case of substance over style, though: the material, being Phillip K. Dick, is first rate - Dick's interest in exploring the irony of the human condition is well tapped, to leave you with a great deal to ponder as you leave the theatre. Is Deckard a replicant, then?
Performances are exemplarary throughout, particularly Sean Young and Rutger Hauer as superhumans with a real achilles heel. Even the Vangelis soundtrack, which no doubt went through a period in the early nineties of sounding horribly dated, has come back into fashion, and suits the mood of the film admirably.

110018,3,0790729628,"The original Blade Runner was a big hit because it was the first modern-day depiction of cyberpunk on the screen. Although there were plenty of urban sci-fi movies that came before, none of them had this kind of atmosphere. It helped that Harrison Ford was the world's biggest movie star at the time, fresh from Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.
But as the years went by, the film didn't hold up. The set design is still great --- the atmosphere is still there --- but the acting is weak and the story is dull. The actors talk too slow. When the action begins, the tone suddenly switches. The sci-fi melodrama becomes a bad martial arts flick (in the scene with Daryl Hannah's gymnastic fight). The final fight is better, but not much.
When the director's cut came out, a few of the problems were solved. The most creative was turning a poorly-edited line about the number of replicants into a surprise ending --- Deckard is sent out after five replicants but he only finds four. Who is the fifth replicant? Take a guess.
But the original problems remain. The movie is still too slow, with a poor use of good actors. The visuals can't make up for the weak plot. Looking back at it, this film deserves all the praise simply because it was such a stunning new approach to sci-fi when it was released. But it's still a 3-star movie, even with the director's cut changes.",1066867200,,1372,4.492
110019,5,0790729628,"Ridley Scott is a director who, at times, can perfectly create a certain atmosphere he desires for his films, most notably being Alien and Blade Runner.  As he captured the void of space, fear of unknown, deadly creatures within confined space in Alien, he is able to channel some of the best qualities of an usual Philip K. Dick novel- surrealism.
  Many of Dick's science fictions focus on the grim, dark outlook of the futuristic world he creates, and infuses a sense of other-world into them, which worked well and create a legion of followers, not to mention several films influenced by or adapted directly from his works.
  In Blade Runner the main conflict is Deckard hunting down the androids, who possess many humane qualities that Deckard feels certain sympathy towards them, or at least thinks twice about the job he's about to do.  At the same time Deckard questions his own identity, and has certain doubts about his own existence of himself being a human, not an android.  The androids he terminates also have strong will towards life, a very human desire.  Top that theme with the dark portrayal of Los Angeles, with brilliant narratives are the reason this film remains as one of the most influential science fiction films of all times, and easily the best adapted work of Dick.  Scott obviously picked up the spine of the original short story, and was able to create the perfect world for the story, and added more character development to be a successful film.",1066521600,,1478,4.78740157480315

The only saving grace for the Blade Runner DVD itself is that it is Scott's original cut of the film minus the happy ending and Harrison Ford's over explanatory voice over.  Any sci-fi fan knows the impact Blade Runner made since it's release over 20 years ago, but for God's sake this film is in desperate need of a re-release.  Warner Bros. has a dubious track record for first releasing some of their best films on lackluster extra-less DVD's, and then years later re-releasing them on 2 disc mostly extra filled sets.  Just look at One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, True Romance, and Unforgiven to see what I mean.  If Blade Runner ever does get re-released (and we all know eventually it will be) it should come with a much better picture resolution (the picture on this DVD is terrible), commentaries from Scott, Ford, and Rutger Hauer, the theatrical version and the director's version of the film, full production notes, behind the scenes footage, trailers, and everything else that this film deserves.

However, over the years it was discovered by millions more and now stands as a sci-fi masterpiece, due to its stunning visuals, storytelling, acting and ambience.  Unfortunately, when it was rereleased as the director's cut, and as much as I regard Ridley Scott as a master of his craft, I considered that the elimination of the voiceover was one of the biggest mistakes ever made in cinema history, as most of the storytelling and mood that made it a classic, was gone.  Regarding the different endings, either are OK as to me the climax of the movie was really in the final scene between Batty and Deckard.
I am one of many fans that will love to see the original BR restored for DVD, as companion to whatever other version Ridley wants included, which I understand will be the so-called Director's Cut and a new Definitve Cut,that, if made right and honest to its many fans and not solely to the director's ego, should reinsert the voice-over along any other new scenes and edits.

110023,3,0790729628,"Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" is an apocalyptic postmodernist vision of the future. The story involves a bounty hunter, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is assigned to kill three replicants - android style robots that look identical to humans, but who have come to earth to seek revenge on their creator - Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Sean Young costars as Rachel, the latest model of replicant who is so incredibly life like that not even she knows that she?s not human. Also in the cast are Rutgar Hauer as Roy Batty ? the ultimate killing machine, Edward Olmos as a drugged out police detective, Gaff, and Darryl Hannah, as the psychotic replicant, Pris. Flawed in its narrative, but visually stunning, ?Blade Runner? has developed a cult following - and it is easy to see why. The production is layered with multi-references to the steady moral and social demise of our own society that stir the mind into rethinking this movie as much more than a sci-fi adventure. This version of the film is the re-edited director?s cut that audiences were never shown in 1982. The subtle tweaking of story and plot elements really doesn?t enhance one?s viewing experience so much as it just alters the story in a different direction.
But what a shame about the transfer! Though the general color balancing and attention to fine details, even in the darkest scenes, is adequate, there is simply NO EXCUSE for leaving the chips, scratches and in some cases, tears in this DVD transfer. Pixelization crops up now and them, but the most disturbing part of the transfer is that it fails to pay attention to the dirt and (in some cases) hair, stuck to the film negative. The result is a dirty looking picture that, while perhaps in keeping with Ridley Scott's vision of a dank, hard universe of the future, is most definitely not what the director had in mind. Saving grace: the transfer is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions. The sonic characteristic of the 5.1 audio is rich, though dated. Strong bass and reasonably well balanced dialogue and effects, though there are a few perceived occasions where dubbing in of dialogue sounds possible.

With the Director's Cut of Blade Runner, these questions are answered for you.  Therefore, so like most films, it is purely a visual entertainment vehicle that does not require you to think.

The original voice over narration is horrible, meaningless, and offers a fake happy ending. Harrison Ford himself admits to doing the voice over poorly hoping that the studio would not use it.

110031,5,0790729628,"This was the very impressive follow-up to his ""Alien"" after a four year hiatus. The story centers around an ex-cop, Harrison Ford, in the year 2019, called back in by his ex-boss to help locate and terminate a gaggle of renegade humanoid clones, called ""replicants"" before they do any more damage. This movie was supposed to be THE sci-fi film of 1983, and almost was, but some people didn't think so, initially.
You may note a pattern here of me having a lot of favorites among the films that, for some ODD reason, critics haven't been kind to, despite the fact that they were obviously exceptional. Such was the case here, too, as this movie, for a good decade after it was released, garnered only two star reviews on a scale of four or five in most of the reviews I've read, along with ""Legend"", another Scott masterpiece.
What size pine cones are stuck up the kiesters of these professional couch potatoes, anyway? For art direction alone, Blade Runner should have praised heaped on it! The visuals in this movie even surpass ""Star Wars"" and nip at the heels of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for sheer jaw-dropping impressiveness. It had few equals among non-blockbusters of the period!
The acting, again, as it is in MOST good sci-fi, is actually, in ways, better than it would be in a normal drama. Professional psycho-actor, Rutger Hauer, as Roy Batty, gives the performance of his life here, (before going on to ""The Hitcher"" where he REALLY gets scary!) as do Sean Young as a replicant that doesn't realize she IS one initially, Joanna Cassidy, as a replicant that was used in a murder squad and Daryl Hannah, as Rutger Hauer's last partner in crime. William Sanderson, (he of ""Newhart"" fame,) is suitably creepy and meek as a HUMAN Tyrell Corporation grunt named J. M. Sebastian, who actually helps engineer these things.
Poor Joanna Cassidy, (this woman has GOT to get a better agent!) as Zora, is here as one of the first replicants to die...this started an unfortunate sequence of roles for this poor woman where it seemed like the ONLY purpose in her films was to be murdered: Next, as far as I know, came ""The Fourth Protocol"", where Pierce Brosnan sliced her to ribbons and ""The Perfect Family"", where Bruce BOXLEITNER {{strangled}} her! (That's right...good old, clean-living Captain Sherdan, Scarecrow and Tron himself!) The only major role I can think of her NOT getting killed in was Delores in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"". She better not make a Woody Allen movie!!
A few semi-well known character actors are in here too, like M. Emmett Walsh, Edward James Olmos, the aforementioned Sanderson, and they round out the major cast of what had to be one of the better non-Lucas sci-fi movies of the early eighties and a classic for all time. It's obvious that, so far, one can't make a bad movie from a Philip K. Dick story, since ""Total Recall"" was also excellent, however, BOTH films are incredibly violent! ""Recall"" much more than ""Runner"". So much so, that it almost takes on a theater of the absurd quality for its excess of it.
I wonder...I WONDER...which one of Dick's stories will be next!

110036,4,0790729628,"To be completely honest, I have never seen the original version of ""Blade Runner,"" with Harrison Ford's voice-overs and ""happy"" ending.  However, I was intrigued to see the directors' cut, to see if the story really needed explaining and, more importantly, if it does live up to  its reputation of a visionary cult classic.  And I am happy to say it does.  Set in Los Angeles in the year 2019, overpopulation has forced many to live on space colonies rather than on earth.  Androids called replicants were made to aid in the construction and mining projects off-world.  But a few revolt, and they are banned on earth.  Special police officers called Blade Runners are created to destroy any replicant on earth.  One Balde Runner in particular, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is at the center of the film, tracking down five rouge replicants (led by a superb Rutger Hauer) who are trying to find a way to their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkell).
What makes the film so memorable, is not only the visual flair of Ridley Scott, but its shrewd discussion on the moral issues surrounding the replicants.  Taking the themes from the Philip Dick story ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,"" one squarely in the foreground is if the replicnts have the capacity to feel emotion, are they really just machines?  Rick Deckard has a hard time with the concept, as will you, considering the impassioned search embarked on by Rutger Hauer and his comrades.  And there is Ridley Scott.  The style and and look of ""Blade Runner"" is vintage Scott, with meticulous, atmospheric direction and sleek cinematography to paint a noir Los Angeles in the near future.  Also, the production design and set decoration are impressive.  Dark, gritty and so utterly believable.
When ""Blade Runner"" was originally released, it was so with a voice-over.  When you watch the director's cut, you wonder why Warner Brothers thought it was needed in the first place.  The story is quite able to tell itself, without Harrison Ford explaining it to you.  It is true that you need to pay attention to the film when you watch it, but unless its the new ""Charlies' Angels"" or someting like it, you need to pay attention to the movie to get it anyway.

After hearing much about the director's cut, I was momentarily persuaded into thinking that Harrison Ford's voiceover was indeed corny and superfluous.  Well, I saw the movie again a few days ago (in the Director's Cut), and I have to disagree.  The voiceover narration that's present in the original version helps move the pace along.  A lot.  And there are specific key scenes where the narration adds a lot more depth than if it wasn't there.  To me the wisdom of the pivotal climactic scene, and how it is comprehended by Deckart is what sets this film apart from anything like it.  As it is now, he just gets a funny, knowing look, and then it cuts to the conclusion.  The full meaning of Roy Batty's actions are quickly overlooked, given the momentum of the scenes that preceded his speech.  You need that bit of self reflection along with the smirk, Harrison.
Yes, I know it's still film noir without the voiceover, but this movie needs it.  I want the original version on DVD, too.

The only similarities are the names of a few of the characters and the (unexplained) replacement of animals with replicants.

That said, I have to admit that I've watched both released versions of this movie a total of at least fifty times.  It has a darkness about it that I find compelling, but there are so many rough edges, plot mistakes, and so much general hokeyness, that I generally watch this at bed time, and fall asleep by the end.

Unlike a lot of folks, I much prefer the original release version (which I have on VHS, and plan to have converted to DVD one of these days) with the narration.  The script is such a POS compared with the P.K. Dick novel that a narration to put a guide for the story is a must.  This thing will never be much of a movie, and the WB executives were entirely correct in their assessment of the need for it.  At the very least, a DVD (with its soundtrack capability) should offer the option of watching it either way.

Those who don't like ""happy endings"" would I suppose agree that the original ending of Charles Dickens' _Great Expectations_ was better.  I'd disagree that the original ending of _Blade Runner_ was particularly happy, since the two lead characters were going into a life on the run.

This movie excels in one way, and that's the visuals -- this view of a dying future, with humans struggling against replicants for no reason they can remember, is enough to hold the interest.  And it's pretty cheap.  Just buy it, and bemoan the lack of the narration as I do.",1054857600,6,1687,4.45928338762215

Are you listening, marketers? The VHS version is fast losing its magnetic particles for those of us who like to see the voiceover version and compare it to what Ridley Scott decided to release on DVD.

110059,5,0790729628,"I love this movie. It's such great example of what a science fiction movie should be...that said, I know people have problems with this particular version, the directors cut. One obvious change was the omission of the narration by Deckard (Harrison Ford). People have said that it takes away from the noir aspect, and maybe it does. Others will say that the narration doesn't need to be there, as the studio didn't give people enough credit to figure out what was going on themselves. I read somewhere that the studio, prior to a full blown release, ran test screenings and made changes based on audience reaction. I actually own the other version on laserdisc, and I just recently picked up this director's cut, and I like both. I am not sure why both versions couldn't be released on one disc so people could just watch the one they want, but there you go. Maybe this will happen in the future. Back to the movie. In case you haven't seen it, it's set in the future, a future where man has created replicants to do the hazardous work for humans. Only problem is they made the replicants too good, in that the newest versions have developed a sense of self awareness, and some have gone renegade. Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner, played by Harrison Ford, is responsible for hunting and terminating these renegade replicants. A small group of replicants has escaped some offworld colony, and made their way back to earth to try and save themselves from shutting down as replicants only live for so long. I don't want to give too much away, maybe I already have, but this review cannot do the movie justice. The attention to detail, the amazing backdrop of a hellish Los Angeles of the future, just the right mix of story and action, the grittiness, it's all so amazing well done. And Rutger Hauer gives what I think is his best performance ever as Roy Batty, leader of the group of renegade replicants, specifically during his scenes with Deckard. He creates within his character a sense of danger, forboding, but also a sense of sympathy. There are a number of layers at work in the movie, so it's prime for repeated viewing. I would suggest seeing both versions, and then making up you own mind which you like better. Regardless, this is the epitome of a great science fiction movie.",1054598400,5,2282,4.637037037037037

I have to say that, although I like the director's cut, it is the original version that really captured my heart and imagination. First of all, the narration made Blade Runner into a futuristic version of the old black and white private eye films. This gave the movie a GREAT retro feeling and in my opinion revealed more about Deckard's character than the director's cut was able to. Secondly, the director's cut really seems to go out of its way to drive home the point that Deckard is a replicant as well. I don't think that made the movie any stronger or better, it just made it ""different"". Rather than a human who finds love in a replicant and learns that you don't have to be a real person to be human in the original, you have a replicant who doesn't know he's one killing replicants and the numerous issues that go along with that. Anyway, if the franchise wants to really make some money, they should release an ULTIMATE EDITION BLADE RUNNER DISC SET with BOTH versions on DVD.

In that time there could be no family, no grandchildren, and no debilitating diseases to signal the pending of one's demise.  The curtain would close - at the height of one's existence.
What if, as a woman, you were also thrusted into the world fully developed -- mature physically, but an emotional novice - and that you allowed yourself to be molded to the satisfaction of your man's desires?
It takes a while to get there, but that is what the movie `Blade Runner' - based upon the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" by that classic sci-fi writer, Phillip K. Dick - is all about.
The film, made in 1982, pictures life in Los Angeles in 2018.  (Even though we're halfway there, we're not even close to achieving the technological advancements depicted.)  Harrison Ford, much younger, is the hero.  He is a ""blade runner,"" someone who kills the replicants (fake humans relegated to other worlds) when they trespass on Earth.  The special effects, although dated and looking like something out of `Battlestar Galactica', are still excellent.  The look of the movie is dark and brooding, like  `Alien', another of Ridley Scott's works.
Three replicants come to Earth and Harrison goes to meet them.  He kills a few, and falls in love with another.  There's some erotically gruesome slow motion death scenes of beautiful, scantily-clad women (Daryl Hannah one of them) being shot in the back and in the gut, oozing innards a la Sam Peckinpah-style, which is ok since they're replicants.  Rutger Hauer, who looks like Paul Newman, gives the most touching performance as he struggles to come to grips with the end.
The movie is futuristic - but actually much deeper -- which is probably why it's achieved an almost cult-like status.  This is a great feature if one wishes to ponder - the meaning of life itself.  Don't miss it!",1051920000,,1979,4.751461988304094

I just watched the ""Directors Cut"" (the only cut available)last night (having only seen the original version many years ago and at the theater). I had heard so many things about this version, yet never anything specific.  It turned out to be nothing that I had expected.  Here's what went through my mind; (if you've never seen this film, beware of spoiler stuff!!)
-I remembered the original being a bit more exciting...  ...I think?
-The lack of narration had little effect on my opinion of the film.  It did seam a little ""lonelier""...  ...I think??
-Harrison Ford sure looks young!!  He really didn't need to act much.
-I had forgotten how ""Asian"" L.A. had become in this film.  Not sure why this is our future?
-Could not get over the fact that this film takes place 20 years from now.  Doubtful L.A. will look like this in 20 years.  I would have picked a date most of the viewers would not live to, like 2100.  That's just me...
-I had heard that Ford's character dies in this version.  I kept waiting for that...
-Some say he is a replicant and will die soon.  OK??  I'm going to need some help with that one.  It was not apparent to me (Though intriguing).
-I guess they imply that the ""Unicorn dream"" was implanted, at the end.  THAT'S REALLY SUBTLE!!  But I get it.
-If he is a replicant, I really don't have much reason to care for him.  And why isn't he stronger?
-Given all this, I like the original better... ...I think?
You see, my biggest problem is my memories of the original are fading.  I really think there is something wrong with that.  When I first saw this film in the theater, I thought it was outstanding.  Now I see the Directors Cut and think it's OK.  It actually moved a little slow for me.  If I could just have a clear point of reference/comparison.  I'm a little upset that the choice has been denied me.  Why is it that both versions were not released together?  Now that would be great!!
I haven't said much about the DVD itself.  Eh.  It is an old DVD.  NO extras at all.  Expectations have risen since this version was released.  Hey, it's not expensive.  A new version is bound to come out soon.  Wait for(and Pay ?$$$?)later.

110070,4,0790729628,"There is some debate over which version of BR is the ""best"".
The original theatrical and videocassette releases contain
the voice-over narration and the ""feel good"" ending, plus
extra violence scenes - all of which are gone from the
director's cut version. The film's creators, the actors,
and,(from what I can gather)most fans of the film hated the
narration and the ending because they were imposed on
Ridley Scott by the studio after test audiences had trouble
following the plot, and after control of the film had been
contractually taken away from Scott after budget overruns.
Thus, an otherwise great film had
supposedly been adulterated by non-artistic interlopers intent
on dumbing-down the film to increase it's appeal to the
great unwashed masses (and their wallets).
In the specific case of Blade Runner, I feel the studio execs
actually improved my enjoyment of the film. When I saw the
original release in '82, the dreamy Vangelis score, the excellent
visuals of a dark and dying Los Angeles, not to mention the
graphic violence, conspired to alternately seduce and distract
me constantly. The voice-over narration provided the viewpoint
""above it all"" that called me back to the plot after being led
off by the texture and power of the production design and the
menace of the fugitive replicants. The famous death scene
where the replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)comes to
his preprogrammed end, is one of the great moments in ALL of
science fiction - and the point at which anyone unclear on the
meaning of the film will be straightened out. Another great and
powerful moment, is when Deckard callously informs Rachel
(Sean Young)that her memories are not her own - they are implanted
copies of Tyrell's niece's. An immense wave of silent devastation
plays across Rachel's normally stoic face - perhaps the finest
moment of Young's career.

 But the voice-over version IS the one that put BR on the map
 - and has more charm. As for the unicorn sequences in the
director's cut, I don't need or want
Deckard to turn out to be a replicant. (Deckard's unicorn dreams
known to Gaff,who makes unicorn origami, because Gaff learns of
unicorn ""implants"" in replicant Deckard from Tyrell) I feel
that it's important to see a true human go thru an evolution
of awareness regarding engineered human life, not
another replicant.  In any other film it would be a
fascinating subject to explore, but in
the context of the rest of BR, awkward. That would mean the
whole movie is about a high-order replicant (Batty) teaching a
 low-order replicant (Deckard) what it is to be synthetic. Well,
that's a cool idea, but to have it descend on us in the last
5 minutes, after assuming Deckard is human the whole time,
and especially after Batty's dying words(written by Hauer),isn't
a thought-provoking shocker ending, but a needless confusion of
an otherwise perfectly wonderful lesson in the dangers of playing
God. We need a quality DVD, loaded with extras, that has both
versions.",1049068800,36,2979,4.95

There are many versions of this film out there, and this is one cut that was released at its 10 year anniversary.  Released early on in the DVD craze, it has almost no extras.  The transfer is amazingly well done, but it got short shrift in the way of extras.  LEGEND got a dual disc release, ALIEN is chock full of extras including deleted scenes, and GLADIATOR and THELMA AND LOUISE both got special editions.

110073,5,0790729628,"Loosely based on Phillip K. Dick's award-winning Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is one of the most memorable visions of the future presented to date.
The film seizes upon one concept from Dick's novel, the universal question of what it means to be human, and explores it through the pursuit of a group of renegade replicants--androids made to serve on extraterrestial colonies and so increasingly life-like so as to be nearly indistinguishable from humans save for their limited life spans--by a bounty hunter or ""Blade Runner"" from which the film takes its title.
Unlike Dick's novel in which the humanity of Deckard, the Blade Runner, is made clear and only questioned once, Ridley Scott reinforced the question of human nature by inserting a series of clues meant to suggest Deckard himself may be a replicant.
The director's cut of the film removes a voice-over narration by star Harrison Ford without compromising the story and replaces the ""happy"" ending of the theatrical release with one darker and more poignant.  The rainy, dark, and post-apocalytpic future in which the film is set remains unchanged and as memorable as ever.",1047600000,,1170,5.09375
110074,5,0790729628,"BLADE RUNNER is one of the truly great Sci-fi films ever made.  Seeing it again over twenty years after it first appeared, it seems as fresh and as vital as ever.  Despite having been made before the predominance of CGI special effects, it feels convincing in a way that today's Sci-fi films frequently do not.
There are several reasons this film works so magnificently.  First, there is the extraordinary set design, among the greatest in cinema history.  For me personally, the set design on this film is as exciting and as visionary as that for Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS.  It is one of the few films ever made in which the set design is as important as any other element in the film.  Second, there is the great central theme of what it means to be human.  In the novel that was the basis for this film, Philip K. Dick's great DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?, there is great doubt that the main character is human.  This is muted in the film, but the question of whether Harrison Ford is also a replicant is very much in doubt (Dick in interviews just before his death claimed that he was a replicant).  Third, the cast is truly great.  Harrison Ford is tremendous as Deckard in one of the best roles of his career.  He evokes the perfect balance of world weariness, existential self-doubt, dedication to his job, and love for someone who may or may not be as human as he is (or is not).  Sean Young, who suffered a premature end to her career through self-implosion a few years later, is remarkably compelling as the near perfect replicant who isn't aware that she is. Edward James Olmos plays a small but crucial role as Gaff, the cop who occupies his time with origami (which leads to one of the great moments in the film).  And a host of other actors and actresses perfectly round out the cast.  But the actor who nearly steals the entire picture is Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the charismatic leader of the replicants.
This was one of the first, if not the first, film to come out in a Director's Cut.  Not all films benefit from such handling, but this one does.  The endings, depending upon which version one sees, are quite different.  Few films demand a DVD format as much as this, with the degree of visual detail it requires, as well as the widescreen.",1046995200,4,2268,4.479318734793187
110075,5,0790729628,"Blade runner is a very special movie in either version.  Both are dark and brooding and thought provoking.  Neither is merely a sci-fi thriller.

The steamy film-noir atmosphere is frequently imitated now, but remember this is THE original.  I recently watched then DVD (Directors Cut) and the film has aged not one bit.
That said, it was NOT the directors cut that exerted these influences.  It was the original theatrical version with the loved/reviled voiceovers.  I recently tried to find a copy of the original version to replace my lost one and could not!  To let the 1982 version disappear would be a travesty.

110076,5,0790729628,"I first saw this film on video in the mid '80s, a few years after the theatrical release and was immediately a fan.  Then in the early '90s, the Director's Cut was released.  Here is where my opinion differs with the other reviews so far.  The voice-over is a distraction and completely unnecessary.  With the voice-over this film was reduced to a Dick Tracy detective story with a very Hollywood ending.  The directors cut has a darker less certain ending with suggestions that Decker is a replicant.
If the SciFi genre can be defined in a single statement, I think it would be ""an exploration of possibilities"".  Many of the SF movies put out by Hollywood are just the same old stories in an unusual setting.  Blade Runner is a dark story where much is conveyed though the setting and visual elements.  Notice that the only place that the sun shines is when Decker goes to the world of the replicants.  The Replicant world is more ""human"" than earth.  This switch in context is a common aspect many SF stories and makes you question your own frame of reference.  These elements come through much better without the voice-over because the voice-over attempts to force the viewer to associate with the human aspect of Decker.  In the original theatrical version, all hints of the possibility of Decker being a replicant is removed.  To me, this negates the core meaning of the film.
The original theatrical version is a good Hollywood movie with a sugar coated ending.  The director's cut is a deeply complex film with film-nior elements.  The ending of the director's cut alone raises questions of existence and reality that the theatrical version does not.",1046044800,2,1658,4.768421052631579

The movie as a whole is excellent for a film of 1982, its graphic imagery and imagination matches that of Lucas and the Star Wars Saga of the same time period.  It's visually stunning with more unveiling suspenseful drama than action, to keep you glued to the film.

  Where the film falls short however is in the ""Director's"" choice of presenting the film.  Alot of Harrison Ford character's thought dialog (found in the Criterion Collection) is axed from the film, in favor of the Director's cut.  This can leave the viewer, who has never seen the film, lost as to what is going on.  The thought dialogs add ALOT to the film, as to who the replicant's are, his knowledge of the replicant's history (when he picks up a set of photos, his thoughts ask ""why... because replicants don't have families"" for example.  Information that makes the direction of his search more understandable, ""vital"", and less confusing.), his thoughts to why he retired from the Blade Runner force, and more.  The Director's Cut is a real hack job to the original and makes the new script very weak.  I can only hope that the ""Criterion"" version may soon be released, as Blade Runner is an excellent film and NEEDS to maintain its original strong storyline.

  The movie was more of an adaptation, but it was achieved with so much skill that when I saw the movie for the first time (I was alone, in my darkened living room), I had to watch it a second time right away. This is one of the most artisticly genuine movie ever. I have seen it again and again, but there was always something wrong: the dialogue is scarse. when I learned that the narration was cut out in the Director's cut, I started looking for the original version. It is nowhere to be found.
All the collector sets, special editions, and other re-editions are lacking the original version. Why it is not released, I don't know; but I'm sure a great lot of folks are waiting for this event!
I'll never buy a Blade Runner DVD without the original version, even if I think the 'Director's Cut' is still in my top 3 movies of all times, with 'The Big Blue' and 'Run Lola Run'.

I don't care much for the unicorn scene, but it's very short and not really awful or anything (it's not nearly as bad as the voice-over on the original release).

Scott did the film world a favor in going back to re-cut a once flawed masterpiece. Excising the atrocious ""let's explain everything to the audience"" voice-over, and the tagged on audience pleaser ending (culled from Kubrick's unused helicopter footage from ""The Shining""), brings the true majesty of the film to the forefront.

I can't remember much more about the first version of this film. Sometimes the producers are right and their ideas make a better movie. That's not to say anything bad against R. Scott. The other movie is good too, just not AS good, in my memory.

LA, in the early 21st century, when old, abused, and greenhouse gassed Earth is inhabited only by the [humans] who can't make it off-world, or the decadents who revel in the multi-culti fin-de-cycle atmosphere of a depopulated city, six replicants - genetically designed slaves with a short lifespan - have arrived to meet their maker and be granted an extension to their lives.

Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a cop who specializes in spotting and 'retiring' rogue replicants.  He must find the surviving four skinjobs and air 'em out.  But who is Deckard?  Why is Dr. Tyrell so callous about creating life designed for enslavement?  Is it because he's seen every inch of a human under the most microscopic detail and he has never come across the soul?  Perhaps he felt different after his talk with the prodigal son, Roy Batty, who defied incredible odds to meet his father.

The performances in this movie were outstanding.  Rutger Hauer will always be Roy Batty for me.  Incredibly tough, enigmatic, brilliant, and dangerous.  The star list in this movie is awesome.  A great collection of A-list actors, and plenty from the B-list who do a A-list job.  One cool actor was Joe Turkel, who I've only seen in two other movies: Paths of Glory and The Shining, where he played the ghostly bartender Loyd.  Turkel plays a very, very good Dr. Tyrell.  ""The candle that burns twice as bright burns twice as fast, Roy.  And you have shined so very, very brightly.""

I could go on and on about how well the casting was done, but just see it for yourself.  Everyone here is a standout on their own, but together they're one powerful cast.

By the way, this movie is about the director's cut of the movie.  Don't go for the one with the voiceover.  That's a piece of garbage.  Apparently, the producers thought the movie was too hard to understand, so they insisted on a voiceover, a cheesy ending, and a bunch of changes to make the film more marketable.  When you look at the sales of the director's cut vs. the original, you'll see who knew how to make a good story - Scott.  And as long as the story's good, the movie will sell, regardless of whether or not she'll live.  But then again, who does?

Also, if you're a Floyd fan, put in Wish You Were Here and turn on Blade Runner.  After the Ladd Company tree symbol (who the hell were they, anyway?), when you first see ""Jerry Perenchio & Bud Yorkin presents,"" hit play on the album.  The album and movie match up really well.  The best part is that ""Welcome to the Machine"" starts just as Deckard is being shown the replicants he has to chase down.

Sci-Fi as an authentic form of expression uses scientifically valid concepts to bring a story about humanity into our reality.  This movie completes this perfectly.

The story revolves around the ex-Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is forced to rejoin and help retire four replicants.  However, these replicants are of a new model called Nexus 6, which are far superior to the previous models.

110096,4,0790729628,"My previous theory was that Mr Scott changed his movie because he wants to be taken seriously as an Artist, (hence the over-blown, bombastic style that made Hannibal a lesser film). I was heartened to read below that this ""director's"" cut was actually assembled by the studio, and that there may be a more developed version that retains much of the narration. As good as this cut is, THAT'S the version I'd like to see...
I think people like the version without the voiceover because it's more mysterious and arty, and it disguises that fact that Blade Runner is basically a sci-fi version of a 40's detective movie. Sure, the voiceover grates a few times, but cut that out and you STILL get the police chief saying ""Talk about beauty and the beast - she's both,"" which is probably the worst line in the movie, and you still get the superfluous and awful dubbed dialogue in the snake shop.
You also get one important piece of new footage: the unicorn dream. The problem with this insertion is (1) it is stuck seemingly at random into the middle of what was originally a smooth tracking shot with continuous soundtrack, and (2) the insert makes no sense in context and has nothing at all to do with the rest of the film...This scene would have been originally been excluded from the film because it doesn't fit the overall structure - sure, the added meaning makes some people feel deep, but on the other hand it invalidates what would otherwise be the main problem of the movie, which is Deckard's grappling with his feelings about killing creatures who might be ""human"". Instead it's a trick ending: ""Turns out he was a robot all along!"" which has nothing to do with the rest of the film.
As you can tell, I have mixed feelings about this version, but of course it's still a great movie - it's Blade Runner, for God's sake! And it'll do until something even better comes along...",1037836800,5,1880,4.5816023738872405

110099,5,0790729628,"With ""Blade Runner,"" Ridley Scott has given film lovers a stunning  film that appeals as much today as it did when first released. From beginning to end, his attention to detail in lighting, set design, blocking...*everything*...is breathtaking. Even twenty years later, ""Blade Runner"" does not appear dated or low-tech; Syd Mead & Jordan Cronenweth out-did everyone else of the period.
The story takes place in 2019, in the city of Los Angeles. Humans have invented robots (called ""replicants"") to serve as slaves, especially in off-world colonies. The latest version of the replicants, though, is so close to human (""More Human Than Human"" is manufacturer's motto) that they begin to develop their own emotional responses. This leads to trouble, as they have fully-formed, adult bodies, but the emotional experience of children (which the actors who play the replicants do a fantastic job of portraying through facial expressions and body posture.)  Because their anger can often lead to violence, replicants have been banned on Earth. Should any turn up, special units of the police called ""Blade Runners"" are dispatched to ""retire"" the replicants (killing them was not called ""murder"" or even ""termination,"" since they are viewed as sub-human.)
Deckard (Harrison Ford) is the main character, and we experience the story mostly from his perspective. He is a retired Blade Runner quietly going about his life, when he's suddenly yanked back into the business by his old boss (M. Emmet Walsh,) who tells him he desperately requires Deckard's help. Six replicants hijacked a ship off-world and have found their way to Los Angeles, where Tyrell Corporation, their manufacturer, is located. They are seeking their creator, Dr. Eldon Tyrell, for answers and little will deter them.
As the story unfolds, we learn more about the replicants Deckard must track down and retire, and it is to be hoped that we develop some empathy for them. To add another layer to the story, Rachel, Deckard's love interest, comes with a full package of complex issues that force Deckard into a bit of a dilemma as he pursues his quarry.
This is not a fluffy, happy movie; it is filled with dark, dripping scenes of haunting beauty (highlighted by the Vangelis soundtrack,) and a moral that is not beaten into viewers with a large, heavy-handed hammer. One of the scenes near the end has Rutger Hauer speaking a monologue that remains one of my favorites, because it speaks to a deep, central part of me that selfishly grieves because when I die, all of my memories will die with me - no one else will see things the way I have. I connect with Roy on a very intimate level at that moment, and I feel most other viewers will, too.
The cast is out*standing*: Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Sean Young, Joanna Cassidy, William Sanderson, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, Joe Turkel, James Hong...holy smokes! Each actor perfectly portrays his or her character with absolute believability, right down to small tics and expressions, and their chemistry is fabulous.
This version of the film leaves out Deckard's narrative, adds a few moments of footage to more clearly establish an implication regarding Deckard's humanity, and removes other footage to clean things up a bit. The loss of the narrative removes a lot of the 40's gumshoe, film noir aspects of the movie, but it doesn't make the movie difficult to understand at all; the film very clearly stands on its own without it.
However, the narrative in the original verison adds a lot of charm to the film, and gives us a clearer understanding of Deckard; I really enjoy that version as well. The film is much more elegant without it, though, allowing viewers to pay more attention to the gorgeous scenery and background sounds, instead of listening to what Deckard is saying, and missing some of the details.
I can't say that I prefer one version to the other, as they both  have so much to recommend them. I couldn't even argue which version a person ""should"" see first; each will color the viewer's experience of whichever film is seen second.
""Blade Runner"" in either form continues to blow me away, even though I have seen it dozens of times. It is always in my list of of top five favorite films, and I very much recommend both versions to anyone who enjoys science fiction, detective movies, or generally excellent film.

Bladerunner is probably the most prophetic and underrated science fiction movie of the last twenty years. Defying movie goers expectations set at the time by the likes of Star Wars, Bladerunner is a dark, moody, sexy and cerebral science fiction fantasy set in a grim rundown future, where there are no clear Darth Vadars and Luke Skywalkers to scream a moral compass.
Consequently it did not do well in dawn of the new patriotism / feel good Reagan era in which it was released. But as the years go by it sparkles as near visionary, and certainly mythic in proportions. Truly Ridley Scott (of ""Aliens"" fame and most recently, ""Gladitor"") delivers his first masterpiece.
Enjoy the endless rain and darkness of a future Los Angeles, in the seedy future as Harrison Ford, putative hero is sent to track down a band of renegade androids who refuse to die as programmed.  The dark flame shot city is so realistic you would swear it was done with computers, but no, this was renedred the old fashioned way with models and has yet to be bested, in my view.
Needlesss to say, the androids, although violent and confused finally develo more humanity than their creators in the ultimate Pinochio metaphor, and restore what is left of that in the bounty hunter Ford. Yet in the cruelest twist of all, Ford comes to question whether he is a human at all, or does  he? You decide.
This director's cut does not add much to the original movie in footage length, indeed there are no new scenes. But it is what it loses that is key, the awful Harrison Ford voice over, meant to mimic the success of that found in ""Apocalypse Now"", is gone, trusting the viewer's intelligence to divine the plot and meaning.  The uneccessary tacked on ""flying away from the city"" ending spelling out the future of the possibly doomed heroes, and ""explaining"" what just happened, is also gone, as it was foisted on Scott by a baffled studio.
(Interestingly, the Rockies type landscape that Ford was apparently flying over in the chopeed ending, was actually spare footage of the rockies from Kubrick's ""the Shining,"" Kubrick was a freind of Scott.)
We recently learned from Scott that the final soliloquy of the Android leader, played by Rutger Hauer in his best role, was rewritten and reduced by Hauer at the last minute, as the studio goons waited to pull the plug on what they regarded as on over budget, doomed affair.  It was done in one take, and sounds like Shakespeare.

110108,5,0790729628,"To put in perspective some negative reviews about this picture,one has to remember how sci-fi movies were made and ambiented, their colours and the stories canned in them, before this one. Only then one can truly understand the importance and historical impact of this masterpiece by Ridley Scott. This is a movie to be seen by all, including those not really into sci-fi. No serious pictures about the future of mankind made after this one, can escape the influence of the dark city portraited in Blade Runner. Not only some very original effects for the time, but also the mood that Vangelis provokes through his musical score, set the rigth place and time to unfold a moving tale about human and nonhuman misery and redemption. This is a place and time were humans kill replicants that were created by them to serve, but not to live on earth or live in full. Replicants that are not supposed to feel, love or despair. But they do, and how.
I can hardly think of a more stirring and moving scene in a picture, than the one in which the last standing ""bad"" replicant (portraited by Hauer)does not do what humans thinks a replicant would do (kill Harrison, the hunter that has just liquidated his beloved one) but instead teaches us all a lesson about the value of life and compassion. If the final speech
that he makes doesn't represent poetry in motion to you, then maybe you didn't deserve to see this wonderful art act.",1033084800,2,1423,4.628458498023716

110110,4,0790729628,"Like most Philip K. Dick novels, this was a good story that was heavily revised, and turned into a great movie...with some strings attached.
When Blade Runner was originally released, it featured a film noir style narrative by Deckard (Harrison Ford). This was added supposedly at the behest of the producers, who sensed the movie was going to go over most people's heads. They were right, and Blade Runner still went over most people's heads, despite the narrative.
That spelled initial box office failure, or at least less than the expected science fiction movie success. On a gut level, the public thought they had this movie figured out, and it had to be Han Solo kills some naughty robots. Yet, instead of thrilling slam-bang action every minute, the public got a pensive examination of one of the greatest ethical issues raised in science fiction: How will we treat artificial intelligent life?
Fortunately, a large segment of the public has since warmed to Blade Runner's core theme, as well as to Blade Runner's rich, palpable cityscapes, which became the template for nearly every cinematic future-world wanna-be: Fifth Element, Judge Dredd, even the later Batman movies. Like most things copied, none of those movies could match the atmosphere of Blade Runner.
These key successes in Blade Runner are still present on the DVD, but...
...the re-release of Blade Runner in the early 1990s brought a few significant changes. Blade Runner had aged like a vintage wine, and audiences who had acquired the taste had no need for the narrative. Even to the uninitiated, an open and thinking mind was all that was ever necessary to keep up with the most important parts of the storyline. However, Ridley Scott also tempered his ending with a considerably less optimistic tone. Furthermore, and perhaps most controversial, was the scene in which Deckard dreams of a unicorn.
Director's Cuts are a controversy in themselves. But Ridley Scott wasn't just adding simple clarifications, or restoring footage cut to fit an optimal theatrical duration. Scott made a blatant change in the reality the movie projected.
Suddenly, Deckard's unicorn dream now played against the already-standing footage, later in the movie, of Deckard's sidekick, Gav, leaving an origami unicorn as a calling card. The implication is a strong one that Deckard, like Rachel, has implanted memories that the authorities know about -- that Deckard is an android, like those he is paid to destroy.
Unfortunately, like a hip Rick Berman idea for Star Trek, it's chic for a moment, but wreaks havoc with the established universe. The Director's Cut transformed Deckard into the android the cops picked to stop other androids. Unfortunately, he must have needed his annual tune-up. Deckard gets tired, he can't run as fast or jump as far as his quarry, and he responds to pain quite realistically through near strangulation, beatings of the face and head, neck wrenching, nose mangling, and having a couple of fingers broken backwards -- all of this from single combat with the androids he's supposed to retire. Maybe the authorities should have invested in a Nexus 6...preferably the combat model.
Well, like the idea or not, there was the Director's Cut. Which would be fine if the DVD let us watch both versions. Unfortunately, the original version of the movie is not on the disk. Most other movies with differing theatrical and director's cuts feature both versions on the same disk, inserting or bypassing scenes to present the appropriate version. The absence of this option is the greatest dissapointment in the DVD issue of Blade Runner.
Like Captain Bryant says, ""No choice, pal.""",1031788800,16,3656,5.074750830564784

Even with the voice-over, I remember that I didn't even really like this movie the first time I saw it on VHS in 1983 (like many, the movie is confusing if you only see it once).  Thankfully, I was persistent and repeated viewings have made this my all-time favorite flick.

110118,3,0790729628,"I had heard so much about this film for so many years that when I finally had an opportunity to rent it, I pounced on the opportunity.  I vaguely recall having played the computer game many years ago, but didn't remember any of the premise.  All I really knew of the film was that I have been told repeatedly that it is an important science fiction movie that set trends that continue to this day, and that as a fan of film, I ought to see it.  So I did.
The film was immediately dark, which I expected, and slow, which I didn't.  Indeed, where I had simply been expecting a standard Harrison Ford action film, I found a deeply emotional film that made me think a little bit.  The subplot about whether or not Deckard is a human is wonderfully done, as it gives the viewer room to draw his own conclusions.  The scene near the end when the final replicant shows himself to be more human than all the humans in the film is tragic, and very well carried off.  And that ending...  I understand that the theatrical version had an additional ending tacked on.  That's a shame; stopping the film where they do is perfect.  I love cliffhangers, and it brings a smile to my face as the screen suddenly goes black and the credits roll.
The special effects are splended, especially for the mid-eighties.  If it were made today, it couldn't be carried off too much better.  The overhead views of Los Angeles; the police cars flying through the air - it's all put together very well.  And the sets...  They're so gorgeous.  I mean, they're dirty, dark, and gritty, but the look of the city is so immersive it's hard to believe it was filmed on a studio backlot.  It's suddenly blatantly obvious where George Lucas got his idea for the seedier section of Coruscant seen in ""Attack of the Clones.""
All in all, the film was better than I had hoped or dreamed.  Sometimes it seems almost poetic, which is unusual for an action movie.  It made me think.  It's chock full of symbolism.  And at the same time, it's the exciting movie it's billed as.  And so dark...  Oooh!  I love it!
Why, then, did I only give it three stars?  Well, the DVD is the main culprit.  I understand that this was released on DVD in 1997, a bit before DVD really caught on, and so I was not expecting great things where menus and special features are concerned.  Indeed, both scores are practically nonexistant (they're there, but you needn't bother with them).  However, the rest of the package also leaves something to be desired.  Now, I've only seen the widescreen side of the disc, as I can't be bothered with losing half the image when it can be helped.  But the transder is not very good.  The picture is grainy and full of noise.  And the very sides of the image have some weird warping effect going on.  It looks as though the image was projected onto a screen and then videotaped to be converted into DVD format instead of transferred digitally.  And though the surround sound is very well done for two-channel, the general sound quality left something to be desired.  So the technical aspects of the disc itself prevent it from receiving a higher score.
The bottom line is that this is a splendid movie that everyone should see.  Now, ever though the disc has problems, I think the film is a worthy addition to my library.  It is definitely worth buying if you don't mind putting up with the quality.  If you do, there is word that perhaps there is a special edition DVD in the works.  It could even include the theatrical version of the film in addition to the director's cut (though why you would want to see another version, I'm not sure).

110121,5,0790729628,"I have not seen the original version of this movie, so I can't compare the two. Regardless of what the other version of this film was like, however, this version was extraordinary - I've never seen anything quite like it before! Besides providing the viewer with a mesmerizing combination of a bizarre setting, appropriate music, and action sequences, this film raised many essential questions about what it means to be human...
Blade Runner is, more than anything, a film noir - in many ways it is very similar to Humphrey Bogart's noir detective thrillers from the 1940s (The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep, for instance). But instead of being set in the dark city streets in the 1940s, Blade Runner is set in L.A. in 2019. By 2019, the movie asserts, L.A. has been transformed into a decaying mega-metropolis, and consists of multitudes of people fighting their way through constantly rainy streets (turning the idea of sunny California on its head) filled with strange shops. Great shots of this bizarre city combined with a perfectly fitted soundtrack create a nightmarish, haunting atmosphere in this film.
Essentially, the plot of this movie concerns Rick Decard (Harrison Ford, in an unusual and very, very good performance), a one time blade runner (i.e. police killer) who is forced by to track down several more replicants (androids w/a 4 year lifespan who are used as slaves but sometimes escape and are illegal on Earth). As the movie puts it, replicants ""were designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The designers reckoned that after a few years, they might develop their own emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, anger, envy. So they built in a fail-safe device...Four year life span.""
Anyhow, as Decker hunts down the remaining replicants, he begins to learn to feel again - at the beginning of the film, he seems even less human than the replicants he is supposed to kill. Also, along the way, he meets Rachael, a beautiful replicant who has been modified (she has been given memories) to even more resemble a human. Saying any more about the plot would give too much away...but one thing is for sure - this is a fantastic film which raises many important questions about humanity and life. Watch this soon - don't let this film's moments get lost ""in time like tears in the rain."" One warning: there is quite a bit of violence, but nothing too terrible by today's standards.",1027641600,,2430,4.84375

I came away feeling pretty much the same, but what is worse than not liking the movie is the DVD is such poor quality.  The sound is horrible, and there isn't any extra features that make it worth buying.  If you like the move buy the VHS version.  The only thing I liked about it was laughing at some of the 80's hairdo's in it.",1027555200,2,666,3.8962962962962964
110123,5,0790729628,"Based on a story by Philip K Dick, Blade Runner won acclaim for its gorgeous cinematography and its dark, film noir atmosphere.  It traces Harrison Ford as a cop that is on the trail of murdering human-like robots. The robots are so close to human that they can try to pass themsleves off as human beings.
As in most of Philip K Dick's stories, the plot has many layers, twists and turns. The movie expands on the theme and draws you into this world where humanity is not always what it seems. Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer co-star as two of the replicants, trying to stay ""alive"" in a world that does not accept them.
The original movie came out in 1982, and because the brass in the studio felt it was too complex for theatergoers, things like narrations and a happy ending were added to make it more marketable. In 1993, director Ridley Scott finally got to put out the version he wanted all along, with a more realistic approach.

Second, it adds to our understanding of the character. Ridley Scott's contention at the time the director's cut was released that the voiceover didn't add anything to the film is simply not true and must be attributed to pre-release hype; without the voiceover, for example, we wouldn't know that Deckerd had a failed marriage in his past caused by his emotional coldness (he was as cold as sushi), which adds to our understanding of the emotional toll caused from his job as a Bladerunner.

But, in my opinion, the 1982 version is better. The reason is that the narrator's voice (which comes out noticeably more convincing in the french version) adds a humanistic/literary/philosophical flavor to a wagnerian epic portraying a crushing and hopeless world, where the distinction between humans and humanoids has become blurred. Then images and words and music miraculously coalesce to create a stunning, operatic filmic experience, culminating in this crucial realization : the preciousness and undestructibility of individual (human/post-human?) consciousness.

A lot of newcomers to Blade Runner only see the Directors Cut and many of them end up hating the movie. Including Harrison Ford's voiceover answers one burning question: Why the heck did Roy save Decker's life?

The director's cut is only a tribute to the (understandable) ego of Ridley Scott.  A novice viewer of the latter can only wonder about what the heck is going on.  I agree with the comments of another reviewer that the death scene of Rutger Hauer is irreparably damaged by the missing voice-over.  This drama definitely needs the aspect of humanity provided by Harrison Ford's narration; it is far too dark and brooding otherwise.  His narrating words in the ending scene, with Ford driving to safety, provide emotional closure:  no one knows how much time they have [so enjoy every moment].  I felt so strongly about all this that I went out and bought a used copy of this movie for 80 bucks on EBay.
The DVD medium allows viewers to watch the version of their preference.  Why not let them choose whether or not to have the voice-over?  It would clearly sell some more DVDs.
P.S.:  I have always wondered why I have never seen anyone comment on one (irrelevant) flaw in the script:  try matching the number of fleeing replicants accounted for in the movie (5) with the number that originally fled the off-world colony (6, according to the skin-job hater).  Yeah, yeah, one more showed up later, but she wasn't from off-world.  There's still one more replicant running around somewhere.  DECKER, COME BACK!",1020038400,10,1412,4.757201646090535

110148,5,0790729628,"Contrary to the opinions of the reviewers here, I believe that the Director's Cut of Blade Runner is far superior to the original release. Having both the original and director's cuts on video, and the Director's cut on DVD, I've watched the movies probably fifty times over the years.
The original cut worked almost in spite of itself; Harrison Ford's narration moved the movie in a particular direction at a particular pace. Unfortunately, it also left very little regarding the story open to the imagination, or to interpretation. While the narration created a vaguely ""noirish"" feel (maybe), it actually undercut the ambiguity that Scott was going for (and which the best film noir work has).
The Director's Cut remedied the flaws: it got rid of the narration, which slowed the movie down a little bit, forcing the viewer to follow and try and make sense of the film (which to my mind is a _good_ thing); the more ambiguous ending fits far better, I think, with the fundamental questions concerning the nature of humanity which Scott attempts to explore throughout the film. From Sean Young's ""personal question"" to Deckard (""Have you ever retired a human by mistake?"") to Deckard's own struggle between his responsibility as a Blade Runner to off Sean Young's character, and his growing empathy/love towards her.
The original cut was a good to very good film; the director's cut is far superior.",1018310400,,1400,4.961702127659574

110151,4,0790729628,"It is popular opinion that the movie Blade Runner was altogether better than the novel on which it was based, Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep'. Quite frankly, having read the book before seeing the movie, it seemed quite disappointing to me, when compared with the original. The importance more interesting, philosophical subjects of the novel was cut down meaningfuly; namely, the philosophical consequences of the idea of a humanoid robot that would be superior to man himself in any way. J.R Isidore (transformed into the very minor character of J.F Sebastian), Buster Friendly, Rick's wife and her eery mood-dialer, and most of all the electric sheep, the most wonderful symbolism in the novel. These were all removed. The idea of the artifiacial animals was only hinted, as was the unsolved question of whether Deckard himself is a replicant or not.
But IN SPITE OF ALL THAT -- when considered individually by its own right, as it should be (it's no accident that the film and the novel have different names!) Blade Runner is still one of the masterpieces of sci-fi cinema. Harrison Ford - though he plays the exact same character he always does - fits right in. Ridley Scott's directing is superb. His biggest stroke of genius is in his relating to a theme that was very subtle and weak in the novel - the film noir atmosphere. Scott did an incredible job creating a futuristic classic film noir, right down to the electronic-film noir musical score.
As an action and an atmosphere movie, Blade Runner is one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Highly recommended for all fans of the genre. Reading the novel is completely unnecessary to appreciate the film.",1017964800,,1686,4.857638888888889
110152,4,0790729628,"I saw this film for the first time about nine months ago. In my opinion this proves that a sci-fi film doesn't really need CG images to make it a popular film like so many of them today. I instantly fell in love with the dark, dingy over populated, polluted cityscape that is Los Angeles. I thought Rugter Hauer did a excellent job as portraying Roy Batty, the leader of the renegade Replicants.
 After I saw this I became a Ridley Scott fan (litterly) overnight. I think it's a perfect blend of sci-fi and the grim outlook of the future. (Which probably in the next fifty years is quite possible.) And a combinaton of an intriguing story makes for a great film. It's definately worth a look. Who know's, you might get hooked like I did:)
 Hey, this movie was placed on the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress as being ""cultrally, historically, or esthetically significant."" I guess that mean't somebody thought it was important. . .
 And for those looking for a little bit further insight, this movie inspired a by now well-known Konami video game producer, the great Hideo Kojima, (does Metal Gear Solid ring a bell?) to create a game called Snatcher. Those of you who might still have a Sega CD system in your possesion might recall this one. It has Blade Runner written all over it. Not in a bad way, but in a good way. Like it pays tribute to this film masterpiece.
 As with any movie, there could be some flaws depending on what you like. If you're looking for intense action, you won't find it here. There's a couple shooting scenes, that's it. The movie moves at a slow pace, which I thought was cool because it showed off a decrepid LA, the hi-tech, but yet not-to-far-off looking gizmo's they had. (Like the Voight-Kampff [or something like that] machine.) And then it picks up in certain parts, mainly the end. My only real complaint is that the Director's Cut is only available in widescreen.

110154,3,0790729628,"I was born in 1970 and after digesting the first 2 Star Wars flicks, I was ripe for Blade Runner's appearance in 1982. This film will endure for decades to come. It has a stellar cast: You can't do any better than Harrison Ford AND Rutger Hauer. These two actors should never be paired again if only to preserve the magic that they acheived in this film under Ridley Scott's direction.
Having said that, I must disagree with those critics who poo-poo the original theatrical version that contained Ford's background dialogue. I will admit that until I read one of the other reviews, I didn't know about Ford's attempt to sabotage the dialogue so that the studio wouldn't include it. However, the film's most important moment for me is Hauer's previously mentioned death scene. Without Ford's dialogue, the viewer has no idea what's going through Decker's mind. Maybe some people can be expected to imagine that Decker ended up feeling pity for the android once he revealed his human side. Unfortunately, if Ridley Scott had intended that there should be no narration/explanation of the film, then the following seconds after the android's death shouldn't have lasted as long as they did. This is a pivotal moment in the movie, and without Decker's feelings being voiced, I think something is lost.
I realize that DVD technology may have been on the cutting edge in '97, and that the studio may have wanted to capitalize by releasing this 'Director's Cut' as soon as possible, but couldn't Ford's dialogue have been included as an additional sound option that could be turned on and off at the viewer's discretion? Here's to hoping that somebody will get the message.

But,that being said,I am vehemently in disagreement with Ridley Scott's vision of what this movie ""should have been"". When I saw the original release of Bladerunner,I felt that the voiceover narration was needed and added much clarity to the film. I saw Harrison Ford's character as a ""Mickey Spillane"" type of detective,what with his tough,grizzled,and unshavened look. The narration reminded me of the old,50's movies like ""The Maltese Falcon"", and ""The Big Easy"". It created a film noirish feel to the film that set it apart from other science fiction films. And,regarding the ""happy ending"",...so what?!I feel it was necessary to provide some type of closure to the story. Sorry,Mr. Scott,but you blew it this time! You should have left it as it was.

This is a movie to be seen by all, including those not really into sci-fi. No serious pictures about the future of mankind made after this one, can escape the influence of the dark city portraited in Blade Runner. Not only some very original effects for the time, but also the mood that Vangelis provokes through his musical score, set the rigth place and time to unfold a moving tale about human and nonhuman misery and redemption. This is a place and time were humans kill replicants that were created by them to serve, but not to live on earth or live in full.  Replicants that are not supposed to feel, love or despair. But they do, and how.
I can hardly think of a more stirring and moving scene in a picture, than the one in which the last standing ""bad"" replicant (portraited by Hauer)does not do what humans thinks a replicant would do (kill Harrison, the hunter that has just liquidated his beloved one) but instead teaches us all a lesson about the value of life and compassion.

110163,4,0790729628,"Harrison Ford is Deckard, a police detective specially assigned hunt down rogue androids called replicants. Consequential innovations of a distant future (actually 2019, and we're past the halfway point between that date and this flick's initial release), replicants are so apparently human, only the detectives called Blade Runners can spot and retire them. Deckard actually hs a lot in common with his victims - after years of chasing androids down, Deckard has become something colder than human (his wife, Deckard told us in the original studio cut, compared him to sushi - a cold fish) and is a retiree himself when first asked to take one more case. Long disillusioned, Deckard allows his ex-boss, a bloated bigot named Bryant (Emmet Walsh) to bad-cop him into hunting down a batch of especially dangerous military replicants called Nexus-6 and led by android Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer). Though few replicants even attempt to return to Earth where they are anyway outlawed the band led by Batty return not only to Earth, but attempt to break into the factory that developed them. (A fellow Blade Runner is critically wounded when crossing paths with one of the band disguised as a factory worker.) Though long disenchanted with a job that had him killing the human-like machines, Deckard outwardly maintains that replicants really are machines either a benefit or a hazard. Only Deckard's love for the sad Rachel (Sean Young), an android who is slowly realizing that she is not human, forces him to change his perspective. (Most of the film has Deckard falling for Rachel, keeping him one step behind the androids themselves). Batty closes in on a meeting with his maker - the founding engineer of Tyrell corporation, a sort of aloof and godlike character who lives in a room looking like one in the Vatican apartments and set inside of a building looking like a huge Aztec pyramid. Meanwhile, Deckard works to catch-up with Batty while staying one-step ahead of another Blade Runner, Gaff (Edward James Olmos) who is gunning for Rachel. The Androids are programmed to die after 4 years a measure designed, less to protect humans from the replicants violent streak than merely prevent the machines from attaining human-like emotional states. One-by-one, Deckard tracks down each of the replicants and, after withstanding a bruising to his body and soul, kills them. With the death of Batty, Deckard's conversion is complete he can never hunt again, nor can he remain in the dark and doomed city that was his hunting ground.
WHY THIS MOVIE IS OVERBLOWN. Blade Runner was an early attempt at sci-fi high concept the crossing over of two genres, in this case, sci-fi with 1940's film noir, but it opened in 1982 alongside the film-noir spoof ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" both films featuring voice-overs by stars with similar sounding voices (Steve Martin and Harrison Ford). The city-scape of the Los Angeles of the future looks fully-realized, complete with flying cars, industrial smoke stacks, giant bill-boards and gouges of flame, but much of the drama is personal the elaborate special effects seldom becoming little more than eye-candy (though sumptuous). Down-to-Earth exteriors, while frenetic and crowded, never look more than incredibly detailed soundstages. (The billboards hawking Pan-Am and Atari as well as a general atmosphere that presumes a modern culture stemming from the economic dominance of Pacific-rim industrial power are amusingly dated). The smoky interior effects and junk-technology in movies like this and Alien, though elaborate, gave rise to the now prevailing futurism which simply relies on cheesy camera-work and second-hand set design. (In classic sci-fi, the future is the clean, orderly and largely tax-free result of human pluck that survived some vaguely catastrophic event occurring shortly after whatever book or film its set in.)  The Director's cut is better in some spots than the '82 wide release version, but falls in others.  The voice overs of the 82' cut were weak (though the ""sushi"" line was priceless), but eliminating them here only exposes the weak narrative of original.  The new version also jettisons the optimism-tinged ending (complete with aerial shots ripped from ""The Shining""), but adds in dream sequences filled with unicorns, suggesting the fairy tale ""Legend"".  (The interior sets, atmosphere and Vangelis score also suggest that film, making it hard to remember that that movie actually followed ""Runner"" rathern than preceding it).
WHY YOU MUST STILL SEE IT: Besides its larger warning of a future as being a bleak era scarred by evils prevalent today (corporate governance, ecological disintegration and dehumanizing technology) ""Runner"" is also a film with unforgettable characters. While Deckard is remote, your heart will be broken by Rachel and the even the murderous Batty. Despite the death he inflicts or hints at in almost every scene he's in, the script wisely keeps Batty soft-spoken to the point of being a child (Gosh, you've... really got some nice toys here), rewarding him with a christ-like death scene sure to tug at your heartstrings. I still don't know what C-Beams are, but it's a moment in Batty's life which will die with him, and that's the painful thing.  The flick tanked largely (cultists claimed) because of a studio-ordered cut adding an upbeat ending and the off-camera narration by Harrison Ford. Those studio-execs never get respect. Catching the Director's Cut in 92, I realized that those studio execs took the fall for a film with an irreparably poor narrative, one so limited, that fans can debate such nonsensical ideas like whether Deckard himself is an android. If that were true, the moral of the film (warning of machines becoming more human than those who build and use them) would be pointless. Instead, Deckards story is of a man once forced to become something like a machine, and now given a last chance to find his way back. You should also catch Runner because of its dated vision, catching those aspects of the film that weren't ahead of their time, but are rooted to a more innocent age flying cars, Pan-Am and early 80's synthesized score courtesy of Vangelis.",1014681600,,6181,5.1158415841584155

Certainly we are heading that way with the extermination of animals in the wild.  Will there come a time when what we call ""robots"" will be as human-like as those in the movie?  Who knows.  Will the climate on earth become as rotten as seen in the movie?  Will people leave Earth to find a better life?  SO many questions were raised in this movie.  I thought that the directors cut was vastly inferior to the original verson with Ford's voice-over explanation.... and I have a copy of both versions.  One of the most intricate and disturbing movie plots ever done.  I LIKE it!",1013817600,4,885,4.56687898089172
110165,5,0790729628,"After Antonioni's Blow-Up, Blade Runner is my favorite film. The special effects are dated (no CGI) and the film editing is staid (compared to, say, ""Matrix"").  But compared to the Star War prequels, it does illustrate how to integrate the special effects into the movie instead of the movie into the special effects.  I mean the actors actually seem to know where they are standing.
While Blade Runner, like Blow-Up, can be appreciated as a genre film, consider Blade Runner as a meditation on what it means to be fully human (first recognize that, if we are not born human, then we must become human through experience and/or empathy). Art conceals art here.
Film as an art form fascinates me because it alone marries the visual image moving through time with musical notes moving through time (if you mention opera here I'm going to mention all the options provided by film editing and music editing and not even bother to mention the fat lady). Few directors have understood this as thoroughly or exploited this as effectively as Ridley Scott. Films are, for me, a sensory and therefore sensual medium. If a film does not please my eyes and ears, intellectual gimmicks remain just gimmicks (think Memento here). A film, like a painting, must have a presence (forget Heidegger and just think of presence as charisma) that attracts and holds my attention by its appeal to my senses. Possibly because Scott started out in commercials, he is an expert at attracting and holding attention, at creating a film with presence. (Hey, if it looks good and sounds good and transcends itself with story and theme, maybe it is good. Lose the critical theory like Dogme 95.  Do I care if it is a hot or cold camera?  No, I only care that it works as a film.)
It surprises me that few reviewers here have mentioned the innovative Vangelis score and the years it took before it was released as a CD.",1013472000,,1887,4.691842900302115

While the Director's Cut is still visually fascinating and taps into some of the same themes, the actuall movie Blade Runner is an infinitely fascinating take on the original black and white film-noir genre and how Sam Spade would fit inside a future world.  If you've never seen either version, I would say get this DVD and watch it today, but I really wish that Ridley Scott would allow the original and much more intelligent thought provoking 1983 Blade Runner to come back.",1013472000,5,619,4.766355140186916
110167,5,0790729628,"...Anyway, about the movie; Ridley Scott portrays a world where ""Replicants"" (extremely human AI intelligence) is unwanted.  They become out of control and lethal.  Blade Runners are sent to ""retire"" them.  Harrison Ford's job as a Blade Runner is to round up a team of Replicants known as Nexus 6.
  These particular Replicants are stronger, more agile than humans and capable of mass destruction.  But Who is looking for Who?
  Ford's character, Deckard is sent to eliminate them, but simultaniously, the Nexus 6 ""pack"" (who include Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer) are looking for Tyrell...the man and coorporation who made them. He only developed Nexus 6 with a 4 year lifespan and the Nexus 6 are looking for life.  It's a gritty world of who will get who first.  Ridley Scott creates a most fantastical world that feels dirty, futuristic, hard, and it has his signature darkness pierced with beaming lights. It makes the movie ""the Fifth Element"" seem child-like.  I watched this movie and I was often reminded of ""Aliens""...with it's eary, dark, pulse- raising feel.
  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie, it is hard to review a DVD like this one.  The one that stands out most in my memory is the scene where Deckard finds ""Zhora"", played by Daryl Hannah. She disguises herself as a ""toy"" in J.F. Sebastian's home (a gentic designer who is lonely enough to create AI toys to keep him company). As Deckard approaches, she sits there, perfectly, like a doll hoping Deckard won't notice her. He does.  The action that ensues from that point on is wild to say the least.  It is pointless for me to go on about the plot. Most of you have seen this movie.
 I hope this review has tantalized the newcomer and warned the true fan about a fabulous must-own.  Could this be Ridley Scott's greatest film?  I think so.",1013040000,,1825,4.700315457413249
110168,4,0790729628,"The present DVD release of this movie is a very cheap and cheerful affair, with plenty of dirt specks, extra grain and poor contrast; not worth having, and not that much better than a VHS copy. It hasn't got 5.1 sound or any special features.
What always annoyed me about this ""Director's Cut"" is that it is missing some very satisfying extra bits in the violent scenes which I've only seen once (in a pre-directors cut screening at a local cinema) which are as follows and which greatly affect the scenes they are in:
1.  Where Roy Batty crushes Tyrell's head, there are some extra bits of him pushing his fingers in. Sounds crude, but the scene plays a lot better and is no more gruesome.
2.  When Roy is trying to stay alive by pushing a nail through his hand, there's a bit more of the nail going in. This is very squeamish but again the scene works better.
3.  The most annoying omission: Pris' dancing attack on Deckard is AT LEAST TWICE AS LONG and WORKS WAY BETTER! In the usual version, she drops him to the floor, does one run up and is shot dead. Very tame! In the never-to-be-seen-again version, she attacks him much more convincingly, and her death scene is also longer and much creepier, with her extra-weird android screaming and wriggling up the walls!
Surely Ridley Scott would have wanted these bits kept? They aren't as ""strong"" as many things I have seen, and this is an adult-rated movie anyway. I won't believe any more hype about Director's Cuts until someone explains this to me.
A special new edition, hopefully properly transferred, is coming along soon. I'm assuming it will still be incomplete. I almost wish I hadn't seen the better version. Where is it? Somebody else tell me they've seen it too, please.",1012953600,7,1734,4.587096774193548

  Yawn.
  The story of a cop being pressed back into duty as a ""Blade-Runner"", a hunter/killer of sentient rogue androids, is very promising, but Director Ridley Scott, while delivering a great LOOKING movie, gives the viewer nothing else to latch onto. The characters are all cold, one-dimensional pawns being put through their paces; I didn't care about any of them at all. Harrison Ford seems to sleepwalk through his role. The replicants themselves didn't seem too menacing; If they're so dangerous,why not send a few more Blade Runners after them, so they can be dealt with that much quicker? Why is Edward James Olmos' character being paid to stand around and do nothing???? Get to killing some replicants, pal!
 The DVD has NOTHING in the way of extras, just some...""Production Notes"", that are really nothing more than Cast Bios. This movie screams out for a Ridley Scott commentary track. And the much-ballyhooed ""Unicorn Vision"", that is supposed to reveal whether or not Deckard is a replicant himself, is all of two seconds long, and told me nothing new. The climactic battle between Deckard and Roy Batty is exciting and beautiful to look at, but that's about it. I had no emotional stake in the outcome of the fight, or the film itself for that matter. This DVD is obviously older than dirt, so hopefully the studio will issue a new version, with some commentary tracks and extras that will shed some light on the more puzzling aspects of the story. In the meantime, I have purchased the BFI Modern Classics Blade Runner book, and I'll be looking for answers there.",1012089600,4,1778,4.778501628664495

The unicorn scene is ambiguous, but it was interesting to watch the film without listening to the voiceover.  I feel Ridley Scott could have done much more, by adding edited scenes.  Negatives: it was shocking to find this DVD was not shown in widescreen, or letterbox.  Also, one can see dirt and other debris in a couple of scenes that was not removed from the original celluloid copy for this DVD.  Positives:  it is a joy to watch this film in DVD and see everything in much better sharpness.

The scenes which parody earlier Dashiel Hammett / Raymond Chandler classics (like ""Murder, My Sweet"" and ""The Lady in the Lake"") remain some of my favorite film memories.  All of those movies had a voice over, and perhaps younger viewers would not realize the significance of the voice over in this film.  To my way of thinking, it is essential to the look and feel of the film, and the mood it created for me.  The gadgets and gizmos are almost standard Sci-fi fare for Ridley, but the feel of this movie is unique in that regard.
I looked forward to the Director's cut to answer two questions --which remain unanswered.
1. Does the ""heroine:"" have an expire date?
2. Is the bladerunner a replicant and does HE have an expire date?
The director's cut, altho it changes the ending, does nothing to answer these questions.  It does eliminate the voice-over, which was one of my fondest aspects of the film.  I choose to stick with the original in DVD, rather than the director's cut.",1011657600,4,1144,4.578431372549019

Harrison Ford's portrayal of a worn-out detective is rather bland, and it is the impressive special effects and art direction that saves this film.  The futuristic setting is dark, rainy, neon-lit, smoky, slimy, and polluted.  Is this what L.A. will look like in seventeen years?  I certainly hope not.
The plot could have been interesting.  Several ""replicants"" (robots) have been unleashed in L.A., and detective Ford is assigned to track down and kill them.  The film moves at a slow pace, but it saved by the fight scene at the end.
This movie could be much better.  The whole idea of Ford's character being a robot is laughable.  His voice-over narration sounds like he's drunk and sunken...",1011571200,,863,4.9375
110174,4,0790729628,"I have never seen the original theatrical cut.  I notice some reviewers complain the director's cut is confusing; although I had issues with the script, I did not find the film confusing per se.
To say BLADE RUNNER is an incredible looking film is a gross understatement.  The art direction--whether costume, scenic design, or special effects--is simply stunning, creating an extremely dark, sometimes beautiful, but always fascinating vision of a future Los Angeles that has begun to collapse into grotesque decay.  Hardcore science fiction fans will instantly recognize that the city's spectacular highrises reference Fritz Lang's silent METROPOLIS; art history buffs should notice a distinct Frank Lloyd Wright tinge to some of the set designs; costume designs are clearly intended to evoke the spirit of 1940s film noir.  The resulting melange is simply extraordinary, very powerful, and incredibly atmospheric.
The cast--including Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Darryl Hannah, and Rutger Hauer--gives able, stylish performances in keeping with the film's dark but glossy tone.  But the script they play is a very muddy one. The story concerns a special agent (Harrison) who is assigned the task of locating and ""retiring"" (i.e. killing) a handful of violent androids who have illegally landed on earth.  Although I greatly admire the film's decidedly ""open-ended"" conclusion, I do not greatly admire the on-going vagueness that besets the storyline as a whole.  We are persistently asked to ask believe that Ford locates his quarry via the vaguest information imaginable; moreover, although specifically described as a highly experienced and formidable agent, Ford's character gives little evidence of it: he's always being bashed around to the point of death and then overcoming his opponet more through dumb luck than superior skill. Most annoying of all, the film flirts with issues concerning creation of artificial life without actually amplifying any of them in a consistently engaging way.  In spite of these failings, the performances and most particularly the incredibly compelling make BLADE RUNNER a fantastic triumph of style over substance.  It is extremely enjoyable, and it is easy to understand how the film has drawn so many enthusiastic fans.
The DVD offers both widescreen and modified-for-television formats.  The former is recommended, for the latter undercuts the visual fascination of the film.  The picture quality of the widescreen format is superior; the sound is good but not exceptional.

1 - Ambiguity and uncertainty are good. If you need a stupid voice-over to tell you what to think, go watch football.
2 - If it turned out in the director's cut that Deckard was a ""replicant"" and you thought that takes away his ""humanity"" and makes him ""bad"" then you're a very stupid person and you missed the point of the entire movie. It's the homo sapiens that are the villains.
3 - It is not a ""futuristic detective movie"". It is a philosophical examination of the nature of humanity. Just because it looks noir-ish, it doesn't mean it's actually noir.
4 - If you want a happy ending, why are you watching such a patently dark movie?
5 - I love the book ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". This isn't the book, it doesn't even have the same name. It's ""Blade Runner"" and it's a movie. Don't compare them, enjoy them separately. Incidentally, you literary pedants, Philip K. Dick himself said he was most impressed with what he saw of the movie before he died.
Okay, I too want a better DVD. I don't NEED extras, or even any kind of 5.1 Surround (but bring it on!), but the audio balance is bizarre and fluctuates, and the ragged edges of the print are a little sub-standard.

A delicacy of a film based upon the intriguing novel of PK Dick, Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?. Watch it again. Feel the cold rain on the overcrowded streets. Look up at the hovercars gliding by amidst towering concrete decay.

The story is about four Androids who travel to earth in the search of a way to prolong their lives and the police officer who hunts them down. The picture of a polluted over populated Los Angles is a back drop to a film filled with noir elements.
This release is different from the original cinema release in that it drops an annoying and tedious voice over and drops an artificially happy ending. The plot of the film is easy to pick up and the inclusion of the original voice over was due to film executives underestimating the intelligence of the viewing public.

I'm sure the studio believed audiences weren't intelligent enough to understand the story, hence the need to add ridiculous explanations. The film also didn't have a happy ending which seemed tacked on, and didn't fit the world as it was portrayed. Yet it was the best version I've seen yet of the film. How many versions have been released to date--6? This version is closest to Scott's original vision and to that first viewing. How many versions will yet come out remains to be seen.

110180,3,0790729628,"Initially, I was glad this DVD was not the version of Blade Runner containing the Harrison Ford voice-over, which I feel ruined the film when it was originally released in theaters. I dislike the voice-over version, and the version minus the voice-over is one of my all time favorite films. Rumors were that the emotionless voice-over Ford gave, he gave intentionally because he disapproved of it. Done properly, it might have worked, but Ford's served only as a simplistic explanation of the storyline for the viewers, treating them as children, rather than giving the ""Marlowesque"" feel supposedly originally intended. This is probably due to the fact that the voice-over was finally added only after participants in test screenings complained of being confused by the storyline. The omission of the voice-over, leaving the events in the film to tell the story, allows the film to be the visual masterpiece it deserves to be. However, given Blade Runner's reputation for visuals, I purchased this DVD expecting to be able to view Blade Runner in widescreen or letterbox format. I never considered that someone would release this visual classic on DVD and not include a letterbox format for conventional TV monitors. But this DVD is only in ""anamorphic"" format. This apparently means you can't view the film in widescreen unless you own a widescreen TV, because the image or picture is stretched to fit your TV screen. For me, this makes the DVD a major disappointment.",1007769600,2,1470,5.053497942386831
110181,5,0790729628,"The director's cut of ""Blade Runner"" is definitely an improvement over the already-fine version that was originally released to theaters.  When one finally sees it without the tacked-on voice-overs, which were added by the studio to make it easier to understand and supposedly to give it more of a film noir quality, it becomes clear that the film's visuals are totally capable of conveying the story on their own -- and watching the film is much more enjoyable when we are allowed to interpret the action ourselves.  In addition, there is now more evidence that Deckard may be a replicant himself, a notion I scoffed at before but now see as an element that makes the film much richer thematically.  A new sequence which shows Deckard dreaming of a unicorn gives the ending (Deckard finds a small origami unicorn in the hallway outside his apartment as he and Rachel begin their escape) added resonance that is lacking in the original version, in which the voice-over narration actually detracts from the film's meaning.  Missing from the director's cut is the tacked-on happy ending showing Deckard and Rachel happily cruising north in his flying car as he explains that Rachel's lifespan is unlimited, unlike that of the other replicants.  The film now ends as it should, with the two entering the elevator and the door closing abruptly to leave the screen black for the credits to roll, allowing us to wonder what will become of the fugitive lovers as we ponder the mystery of whether or not Deckard himself is a replicant.  Something to look for in both versions -- Gaff's (Edward James Olmos) origami creations (chicken, person, unicorn) always convey his feelings at the time, and as the film progresses we see him develop a grudging respect for Deckard, until at last he says to him ""You've done a man's job, sir"" -- the ultimate compliment to bestow upon a replicant.",1007424000,2,1876,4.846875

At first, I thought the movie stunk, because there really is just one action scene in the entire movie. But now, when I ""saw between the lines"" as it were, I discovered the fragilety in each of the characters. Whenever the characters start to fade away, such as the replicants tend to do (robots that they are (one played by brilliant Rudger Hauer)), the music of Vangelis does the rest of the job. The music, the dark of theme of the movie, the great but not overdone acting, everything is at it should be for a good science fiction flick.
George Lucas seemed to misunderstand that fact with the new Star Wars 1 movie ey? They don't make them like they used to, plus this version doesn't have the annoying Harrison Ford voice over in the ending, and doesn't have that ""chipper"" ending that seemed ""finished in the last moment.""

Those who have read the book look at it and say ""I can follow the film, but they really chopped this up."" This is often the feeling of what the directors cut does to those of us who have seen the original film in the theater. Having seen a number of Humphrey Bogart's detective films, the noir style of the original release and the trench coated Harrison Ford as Deckard give it a nice retro 40's feel. His Bogart-esque ""Sam Spade"" voice-over makes this work perfectly. To people who have never seen the film before and watched the directors cut, their comments have consistently been that they didn't understand the film. That it seems like something is missing. When they watch the directors cut after the original release they have no questions about it and find it good and more artistic interpretation, though less understandable version of the film. The voice over explains much of the characters thoughts and feelings to the viewer, without which the viewer ends up with far too many questions about what is going on and the actions of the character. Perhaps some like leaving this open to their own interpretation, which is their choice. But they are watching the film having seen the first release, giving them an overall understanding based upon the original. To the uninitiated watcher, this almost always elicits confusion. To someone who has seen both and prefers the directors cut, by all means this is a reasonable version. To anyone who has never seen the film before, go see the original before you watch the directors cut, otherwise it won't make much sense to you.

My wife and I saw it on the big screen during it's original release and walked out loving this movie, forever!  The original gives  a touch of the stylistic film noir, with a traditional detective voiceover,  in an incredible, though dismal, futuristic setting: Huxley meets Orwell.  The rainy, steamy environment reminded me of city life in Japan, complete with  misty, summer fog reflecting the glow of neon.
I like the voiceover similar to appreciating Martin Sheen's voiceover in Apocalypse Now.  It's like visiting a foreign country and having a guide taking you through the unfamiliar streets.

110185,4,0790729628,"""Blade Runner"" had a very odd theatrical release: the first audiences saw different versions of the film (the studio recut it depending on what they heard from moviegoers). Just goes to show you - never rely on what the average viewer says. ""Blade Runner"" is much, much better without the hokey, noirish voice-over and uplifting finale. Harrison Ford, by his own admission, said he hated the narration and deliberately botched it (so the producers kept it, natch). And isn't it common coin in Hollywood to jam in a happy ending?
Fortunately, the trend of ""director's cuts"" came along at the right time. The real ""Blade Runner"" could have easily languished in Warner Bros. vaults while fans put up with the Embassy VHS (which I own) and subsequent DVD transfer. As of this review, most people hate the DVD handling, but the ""Director's Cut"" VHS is worth keeping your VCR around.
The film is the superior vision of life on a downward spiral, and its dizzying, tantalizing glimpses of a not-so-futuristic megalopolis are arresting. After reading Philp K. Dick's novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" and seeing the movie, it is obvious that the original message about replicated humans is far more ominous than the original theatrical version can convey. The burning question is obvious: is Ford's character a replicant himself? Does his brutal dispatch of the dangerous androids represent murder, or just disposal?
In the end, the fantastic, impossible world created by Dick, and made flesh by Ridley Scott, is the real draw of ""Blade Runner."" To rely on a voice-over for plot clarity is to miss the point.
Vangelis' score and myriad aural touches add to the oppressive atmosphere. Subsequent sci-fi films have copied the ""Blade Runner"" look; all of them pale in comparison. Even if the studio were to somehow cobble up a sequel, it'd never recapture the look or feel of the real thing.",1004400000,18,1891,4.949685534591195

I saw the director's cut the second it hit the theatre years ago in a new state-of-the-art Sony theater in NYC. The projection booth was fully ""automated"" and it began rolling the film with audio only, the screen was totally black. Finally after 5 excruciating minutes, the picture belatedly came on and the theatre manager thought he could just keep the movie rolling  until a near-riot started in the theatre. This was a Blade Runner audience. We demanded to start again from the beginning, we weren't going to be deprived of seeing a pristine print of the breathtaking opening sequence. The manager explained to the angry crowd that he couldn't just back up the projector, that it would require the time-consuming chore of removing the reel and rewinding it on a bench and the mob shouted:""do it now, we don't care how long it takes."" And the contrite manager eventually started the film from the beginning 20 minutes later.
 Well, Warner Bros. has done a similarly bad job of presenting B.R. on dvd. Right from the first 5 seconds, squinting at aliasing blurred titles, it looks as though you're watching a vhs tape that has been rented 100 times rather than a brand new dvd of a restored film. Oddly, the letterbox doesn't fully extend to the left and right edge of the tv screen. A smallish rectangle view floats in the middle of the screen with ragged pulsing edges. Unable to stomach watching the whole movie looking like this I scanned ahead to see a poorly transferred picture complete with dust and even a curly hair making a guest appearance! Like that hapless theatre manager, Warner Studios has made a big mistake underestimating the Blade Runner audience--we demand a refund and a re-release done right!",1003708800,16,1868,4.709480122324159

Certainly, it is a strange film, but one that is hugely meritous for it's somewhat apocalyptic vision of the capitalist future within the context of a city of fallen angels, and the manner in which it explores the concerns of the age and humanity's fall from grace. Does being human give us all the attributes of humanity, for example, compassion? Do we need to be on the edge of death before we can appreciate life?
This version leaves many questions unanswered, and though I have not seen any version but the Director's Cut, I cannot imagine 'Bladerunner' with a positive outcome. It seems to defeat the entire purpose of the text, and the loss of the most important and beautiful line of the piece (as I see it) 'Its a shame she won't live, but then who does?' would affect the entire concept. A piece were life was present (like the original work) seems almost contridictory to the hopeless, loveless and careless setting of the work. Deckard as a non replicant (he is a replicant-how else would Gaff know his unicorn dream unless they were programed..) would also destroy the entire meaning of the work.
It is truly a fabulous work if one really considers the concerns of the director, and how his view of the future and critism of the present world and growing capitalisation is considered.",1000166400,,1495,4.688212927756654

I'm sorry, I think Harrison Ford is a very good actor and I love his role in this film. I realize he did not want to do the voice over in the original cut but this movie screams for it. Ridley Scott in my opinion is a hit and miss director. He seems to think he knows more about what we like to see as entertainment then we do. There is good news and bad news about this Directors Cut. The good news first. Artistically, this movie is incredible, absolutely stunning. The production design was worth every bit of praise. Never has there been to this day a better looking futuristic city in the movies. Visually it's timeless and beautiful. The characters and scenes are well shot and inspiring. The story is a good one, too. A small group of escaped manufactured humans looking for freedom. Ford is very good in his character as the Blade Runner who is sent to destroy them. This all sets the stage for a very intriguing morality play. They may be manufactured, but they are still human, shouldn't they have the right to live? This is basically what the movie talks about. Now the bad news. Scott's pacing is so slow and cumbersome (come on Ridley how long do we have to look at every scene?) that boredom sets in. I'm not asking for fast paced action or explosions, I realize this is Science Fiction and there is a story unfolding here, but there are scenes that don't even do anything to keep your attention. In addition, the original novels were inspired as pieces of futuristic Sci Fi detective film noir. The voiceover helped establish that, it also helped keep the movie going at the slower scenes. I am the first one to say that movie executives don't have a clue as to what movies are supposed to be like but in this one instance they were right. The movie needed a boost. Ford may not have liked doing it but even though he purposely did it poorly, it still fits the movie. His deadpanned tone and lack of inflections are a throwback to the detective stories like Philip Marlow and Mike Hammer. I was extremely disappointed in the directors cut, only because of the lack of voice over. I think it added more to the morality and substance, it brought to the front of the mind the questions the movie was trying to make you think about. I did like the alternate ending and the dream sequence, very interesting if not ambiguous. But it could have stood with the original. I still give this movie two stars because it's still a visually exciting movie to this day, but you can only look at a movie for so long before it pushes the boundaries of your attention.",999043200,27,2738,4.402366863905326

It gives them memories but only a limited lifetime - 4 years and sends them on assignmnets deemed too dangerous for human beings. They were banned from Earth and Decker, a Blade Runner, someone who hunts these replicants, is sent to find them and terminate them.

When a bloody mutiny happened in the Off-world colonies, replicants were declared illegal on Earth, under penalty of death. Special police units, called blade runners, were assigned to kill any tresspassing replicant. This was not called execution, it was called retirement.

110204,4,0790729628,"First off, I'm surprised to see so many people arguing for the Theatrical Cut. The idea of narration to make the story clearer (it can be a bit overwhelming at first, due to the visual spectacle) is superb on paper, but in practice it really doesn't illuminate much, and Ford's deliberately-flat delivery of the lines hurts the product as well. The ""happy"" ending is a cop-out, featuring an upbeat twist with no precedent in the film, and being much too sappy given what we've seen before. I'd be fine with the theatrical cut being available (after all, the BRAZIL deluxe box set includes the ""Love Conquers All"" cut), but it's in no way superior to Scott's true vision.
Okay- the movie itself is one of the great science fiction films, with an astoundingly atmospheric portrayal of a run-down L.A. of the future- the Art Direction and visual effects are superb. However, there's substance to go with the style- like Philip K. Dick's original novel DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP (quite different from this film version, highly recommended in itself), it's a story about what it means to be human. Are the ""real"" humans in this movie really any better than the Replicants? Do they have the right to exterminate their own creations? And which is which anyway? Another highlight is Rutger Hauer's astounding performance as Roy Batty, alternately passionate, crazed and sympathetic. It's a shame his career hasn't gone better.
The flick has a lot to recommend it, but unfortunately the DVD seems to have been produced when Warner Bros. was just getting the hang of this newfangled technology. Picture and sound quality are adequate, enough to show off an already great-looking movie, but there are no special features of note- not even a trailer! The greatest flaw on this DVD is that the ""Jump to a Scene"" feature doesn't even cover all the chapter stops in the movie- if you want to get to, say, chapter 6 or chapter 12, you're going to have to crack open the manual that came with your DVD player. I suppose I wouldn't have a problem with all this if the disc weren't so expensive, as Warner Bros., if nothing else, is usually pretty reasonable on pricing. I can name several DVDs released by the company which are better-presented and cost less- heck, just do a search and you'll find them.
Fortunately, BLADE RUNNER is a good enough movie that it's worth the purchase price- if you've got a DVD collection, you should probably consider adding this. However, it's a shame that WB didn't wait just a tad longer to give this a better treatment.

However the perhaps 10-15 minutes they cut out of blade runner, and put back in do not make up for the ongoing thought verbalized in Harrison Ford's head.  Ok sure they make you think perhaps that Harrison Ford is a replicant himself with the vision of the unicorn, and Edward James Olmos character(perhaps his first job on sceen before Miami Vice?) leaving a unicorn origami, lending one the idea that perhaps the police dept knew more about Harrison Ford than he himself did, but that in No way makes up for the superb remeniscing done by Ford as the movie moves along, I even Showed my 15 year old son the whole DVD and then took out a VHS copy I had from an old showtime or HBO version of the original and played the ends back to back and even he agreed the original explained more about the characters thoughts and made the movie not only more intelligent but more desirable.  The Dvd ends in blackness, while the original cut has them flying over what is perhaps virgin North American Forests giving you the hope that they found happiness as Harrison Ford remarks, true they did not give an inception date for Rachel, but then again as Gaff said who knows how long we may have.

Speaking of the book, I have heard a lot of people complain that this is a bad adaptation of it, Philip K. Dick's masterpiece Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? And, true enough, it leaves out some things from the book and changes others, but this is to be expected for any adaptation. One shouldn't expect a book's purely literary qualities to come across on the silver screen; rather, it is nice instead to see the particular qualities that movies can deliver better-i.e., visuals, cinematography, atmospherics, etc.-focused on instead.

Further, the DVD finally restores Ridley's vision to the film, removing the ""happy ending"" and the voice-over that not even Harrison Ford could stand. The movie is finally viewable as it was always meant to be, and the story unfolds brilliantly.

110220,5,0790729628,"This is one of the greatest films ever!  Using the science fiction genre very effectively, it is really about 'man's inhumanity to man'.  The rich and powerful, Capitalists once again, have 'created' 'androids', which they call 'replicants', which are human beings made bit by bit by genetecists, rather than in one go by natural means, and they have 'denied' them their humanity, and thus their human rights.  In this way, they have created, effectively, a 'slave' 'race'/ people, whom they 'may' exploit as they will.  Some, for example, they have made as 'pleasure models', 'used' for for sexual purposes, and psychologically shaped to fit the role, and others are 'used' for warfare, created solely to fight the battles of their 'creators', suffering in their places all of the horrors of the wars which their 'creators' chose be fought.  Some of these 'androids'/human-made humans reach earth, intending to revenge themselves upon their 'makers' for creating them for exploitation, suffering, and an early death.  One of them survives long enough to kill one of these 'people', but he dies soon afterwards, his lifespan having been determined by his genes at precisely thirty years.  His victory feels empty, in a world where noone cares about it, except him.  As he dies, he mourns the loss, so early at thiry years of age, and with noone to pass them on to , of his memories of the amazing cosmic sights which he saw in the heavenly battlefields where he was forced to fight.  This film is very heartfelt, and its poignancy is all the more unmistakeable because of the selfish, survival-oriented, 'social' setting in which it is placed.  It also contains a romance of the central character, bringing to the viewer an understanding of the humanity of the 'andoids', and an identification with their plight, as the central character finds himslef to be an android, and needs must flee his human pursuers with his android mate, in order to survive for however long he has been genetically programmed to.
A 'tip' for 'genetic' 'creators'/Capitalists/abusers: If you want to abuse ORGANIC material, do not make it look human!  Or, REALLY, DIE!",994032000,3,2145,4.997191011235955

110223,1,0790729628,"I only saw Blade Runner because it's my dad's favorite movie, and I got it for him for Father's Day.  Anyhow, we ordered pizza and sat down to watch the Director's Cut of Blade Runner.  As the movie started, I was like ""okay, this isn't so bad after all,"" but I quickly took back my optimistic thought process.  It was a depressing 2-dimensional action/sci fi flick about... well, what was it about?  I don't know if anybody's sure about it.  Another mystery.
Anyway, Rachael, the replicant object of Deckard's affection, has no personality whatsoever.  I seriously wonder how he fell in love with her.  Maybe he's a replicant too... and, miraculously, that's the amazing question the movie is asking.  There is some deep meaning in this film.  Is it that Deckard is perhaps a replicant too?  Wow.  Too hard to handle, for me at any rate.
Most of the film I didn't get, including the white-haired replicant guy who ran around howling with a nail through his hand.  He was extremely creepy, if not completely repulsive.  The only part in the movie that I enjoyed was the 10-second-long vision of the unicorn.  At least I think it was a vision.  It was neat, but I'm not sure how it fit into the story.  I also liked the end, because it was not really an ending at all, and because that meant the torture was over.  But I suppose this all has to do with some mind impediment that I suffer from.  After all, I'm just a moron with no taste for sci fi flicks, except of course for the coolest movie ever, Star Wars.  Well, I guess if you're like my dad, you'll enjoy Blade Runner.  And if you appreciate real plots and characters with emotions, then you won't like this movie at all.",993340800,6,1678,4.457236842105263
110224,3,0790729628,"My VHS copy of Blade Runner is getting old, so I went ahead and bought the DVD of the ""Director's cut"" even though I had already seen it and was very dissapointed. I was suprised to get TWO versions of the film on the DVD: a standard version and a widescreen version. That's nice. The interactive menu, especially the scene access section, was pretty lame, however. It seems that not much thought was put into this. Also, the movie seems to play automatically and with subtitles, so you have to stop and turn off the subtitles then restart the movie!
As for the movie itself, I have said I didn't like the director's cut very much and watching this DVD didn't help matters any. The omitted voice-over by Harrison Ford is the biggest problem. Those scenes where he had been talking are now uncomfortably long and silent. If Scott was so insistent on taking out the voice-over, why didn't he tighten up those scenes so it would be more watchable? As it is now, we see Harrison Ford just gazing off into space and we don't know what he's thinking or what purpose these long shots of him just sitting there are supposed to have.
And another thing: the so-called unicorn dream. Part of Scott's original vision? I don't think so. Obviously, this was lifted from his film, Legend, and inserted into Blade Runner to connect with the foil unicorn Deckard finds at the end of the film. It doesn't fit with the rest of the film at all. It's an afterthought, hardly the director's ""original vision.""
Probably my biggest question with the whole movie is what happened to the last Replicant? We are told six ""skin-jobs"" jumped ship and came to Earth, but one got fried trying to break into the Tyrell corporation complex. Lets's count now. That leaves five. Rutger Hauer is one, Daryl Hannah is two, ""Leon"" is three, and ""Zorah(?)"" the snake dancer is four. What happened to the fifth one? This is never explained and if you start thinking that Harrison Ford is the fifth Replicant, then the entire storyline pretty much falls apart with ""then why didn't they..."" and ""then how come they didn't recognize..."" questions.

110227,4,0790729628,"Unlike the countless films which have adopted this film's look and feel, Blade Runner was crafted with more tension and more dark human nature than any other sci-fi film could even attempt.  Director Ridley Scott creates a vision of Los Angeles, circa 2020, which is one of the most original and memorable future worlds ever put to celluloid.  Unimaginable skyscrapers tower over streets that are clotted with humanity; around the skirts of the billion-dollar towers, the city at ground level looks like a third-world bazaar.  Amidst this backdrop, a quiet masterpiece unfolds casting Harrison Ford as a blade runner -- a cop assigned to track down and kill ""replicants,"" who are artificial humans, built through genetic engineering.  After an uprising on an outworld, six replicants have returned secretly to Earth, where their deaths have been ordered by the Tyrell Corporation.  Ford ends up falling in love with Racheal, played by Sean Young, in probably her best performance ever, a beautiful replicant, who just wants to live the life she believes she's been given.  Director Scott never allows too much sympathy or emotion to arise in this steel-and-microchip 21st Century Los Angeles but rather allows the viewer to make up their minds about how strong their compassion is without being led on.  The bleak rain-slick streets that Ford walks on, though seemingly far-removed from our own, are, in reality, the exact same streets that we ourselves walk on.  And the corrupt and dehumanized state of the totalitarian law isn't so far removed from our own questionable ethics and justice system.  It poses several questions: Is it a crime to want to be human?  Is it moral to play God and give and take life as we please?  These all seem to be racing through Ford's mind as the film goes on, and his icy and distant demeanor is exactly what the role calls for.  He is, in essence, the prototypical cold and disillusioned lead character, whose conscience over what he knows he must do torments him throughout the film.  While this version does seem to be somewhat overwrought with self-indulgence (as is the case in most director's cuts), and while the abscence of the original narration makes it somewhat confusing, especially to a firsttime viewer, this is still a masterpiece.  Truly a landmark of science fiction as well as modern film noir.  The movie's Los Angeles, with its permanent dark cloud of smog, its billboards hundreds of feet high, its street poverty living side by side with incredible wealth, is so prophetic it's frightening.  Without a doubt one of the best sci-fi films of the '80s, and a must-have for fans of Harrison Ford and director Ridley Scott.",992822400,3,2676,4.953020134228188

110231,3,0790729628,"In comparison to the original version, complete with Harrison Ford's voiceover, the Director's Cut doesn't really cut it. This is because the film is based on a book in which there is little in the way of the overt action required for a Hollywood blockbuster that would be competitive with the likes of Alien or Star Wars, and any deeper meaning is too obscure to be successfully conveyed in anything other than an art-house film.
Only the spectacular cinematography and the highly accomplished integration of its soundtrack has saved Blade Runner from the oblivion that it would otherwise have enjoyed, as has been the case for subsequent films such as Event Horizon, which rely too heavily on SFX to bolster a thin story line more suited to an episode of the Twilight Zone.
Blade Runner, in its Director's Cut guise, is simply an indulgence for nerds with the inclusion of the unicorn dream sequence to reinforce the idea that Deckard was an android - like I could give a Shatner. The so called `upbeat ending' of the original is insignificantly different except as an exercise to harmonise the look of the film. And the dropping of the voiceover makes the longer interior scenes drag, as do those in Michael Mann's, Manhunter.
The original fails by virtue of the slack closing sequence in which Deckard and Batty race about through the upper floors of Sebastian's apartment building. This might have been reconciled by judicious editing, but as it is, in both the original and the Director's Cut, it saps the film of necessary momentum, and is slightly pretentious.
My feeling is that the original with a few editing tweaks would have been altogether a better move than what the Director's Cut tries to achieve; the modifications employed and their justification offensive and condescending to those, like myself, who enjoyed the film when it first came out.
Re-release the original, guys, and quit being so precious.
( One for the nerds: compare the closing scene where Batty plucks Deckard from the steel beam with the scene from Star Trek's `What are little girls made of' in which the android plucks Kirk from the edge of the bottomless chasm. Uncannily similar - huh? ).",992390400,6,2178,4.873315363881401

Before there ever was Star Wars, there came a maverick, anachronistic director Ridley Scott who made this film. The movie received little recognition by the snobs of Hollywood, but over the past two decades the movie has far surpassed all expectations and grew into a cult status. In a way, the movie and Mr. Scott proved to be much ahead of their time.
Engrossing, philosophical, metaphorical, and with endearing love theme set in a world of futuristic time, Blade Runner will pull you into a movie experience like none other.
There are two versions to this movie: the theatrically released version with Harrison Ford's voice narration, and the current DVD version without the voice narration (director's cut). Although only the latter version is currently available it shouldn't be shunned, for it makes no real difference to the enjoyment of the movie.

I don't mean to insult anyone, but the ""happy ending"" went against the movie's intentions. You spend two hours in a dark, damp dystopian world and then all of a sudden you're in the sunny, pristine mountains? Please. Mr. Scott threw in that ending at the last moment to make the studio happy, a studio that was totally blind to his genius in the first place. A lot of people have also stated that the Director's Cut ending doesn't sufficiently conclude the movie, that is just ""drops off"", and has left some with an uneasy feeling. The point of this ending is to be ambiguous, to leave it up to you what happens. And don't even get me started on the narration. Yes, I'm sure a lot of people think it helped to explain the movie, but it also guided the viewer by the hand and ""talked down"" to the viewer like you're a moron. All the narration did was basically show Deckard (being a detective) discovered something and then said to the audience, ""Look, I discovered something!"" The lack of narration in the Director's Cut allows the audience to notice some of the visual keys they missed while following along with Harrison's groggy storytelling, and also illuminates some of the nuances that makes Harrison Ford a great actor.  Aside from the bare-bones dvd (Warner Bros has a boatload of stuff lying around that could be on this disc as extras...two discs worth, in fact), this is an excellent film about humanity in a dark, corporate-corrupted world, and the director's cut eliminates the narraton and sappy ending which guide our hands like we're 6 year olds, and allows us to fully enjoy this film as a future noir. And if another, more comprehensive DVD ever appears with a Ridley commentary, allowing Mr. Scott to  explain what he was thinking, then you people won't need a terrible narration and sappy ending to do so.",992217600,10,2051,4.662983425414365

And as I am a big fan of the directors cut, I don't miss the original narrated version...but having both versions on a newer DVD would be nice for the fans. The really important reason for a new version of the DVD is the print and video mixing are just barely tolerable.  The contrast is blown out making the city effects sequences in particular look ugly harsh and grainy. That's really a shame as this film is all about creating an awe inspiring vision of a bleak future Los Angeles. And secondly, the widescreen version has a very thick black border surrounding the entire image cutting down on the already reduced size of the image making it all the smaller for people wanting to watch the film in widescreen.  No doubt this smaller territory for the image causes the film to look less sharp, and more grainy. If you buy DVDs for the enhanced picture quality. Don't look for this DVD to deliver for you.  Whether you love it or think it is slow and boring, Bladerunner is considered a classic in its genre and merits a better treatment.

Rick Deckard (Ford) is a retired cop.  A ""Blade Runner"" who hunts down replicants who make it to earth, where they are not legal, and kills them.  He is blackmailed into taking another job, to ""air out"" 4 Nexus-6 replicants who have hijacked a shuttle and taken it to earth.
If this movie has a downside, it might just be that it was far to subtle for ""joe sports fan"" moviegoers.  A look at the reviews here on Amazon would seem to uphold this opinion.  The ending of the director's cut IS a happy ending.  It is amazing how many people who liked the movie don't get that fact.
Another subtle clue to what is really going on, (possibly a spoiler, but probably not noticed by most of those who have seen it) is that replicant's eyes glow red in some scenes.  The first one is the owl at the Tyrel corporation.  And this comes through much better on the DVD director's cut as well.

The characters were struggling with the meaning of humanity itself in a dark futuristic setting. But all the darkness was worthwhile because in the end things work out very well for some of the characters. I definitely would have rated this movie with 5 stars.
When I learned that the DVD version was out, I immediately bought it and watched it. When it was over, I was outraged. They cut the good ending. The Director's cut was NOT the same as I saw in the theater. Because they didn't have another ending to put in, this version has no ending. It just suddenly quits. They also cut the narration throughout which served to explain the movie. Because I had already seen the movie in the theater, I didn't much miss the narration until the end of the climactic scene near the end on the rooftop. The narration there in the theater version really added a lot.
My recommendation is that if you want to see a dark 3-star movie, buy this. However, if you are expecting the great 5-star movie you saw in the theater, DON'T BUY THIS. I very much disagree with the review by Jim Emerson that says the director's cut was better than the original theater version. The movie executives knew best that the narration was needed to give viewers the full import of what was happening. They also knew that most people want a happy ending.

As one reviewer has already pointed out, BLADE RUNNER addresses the nature of consciousness, the future of cities, and man's moral obligations to non-human life-forms in a lyrical and understated manner.  It's also a great love story about the Feminine Principle surfacing in a beautiful android to seduce a jaded, numbed human back into his humanity (and there is a yet another twist to this at the end).
BLADE RUNNER has aged very well. Scott's and futurist Syd Mead's vision of 2010 LA is still way ahead of time, and the film dates as well as, say, Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA (1960), which was so original IT looks ahead of OUR time.  Top it off with stunning production design (oh, the rain, the rain... the wonderful textured surfaces), remarkable acting (Sean Young, beautiful beyond words; Rutger Hauer, waxing eloquent as he fades) great sound design, and Vangelis' sublime score alternately twinkling and sizzling with faded hope and sexuality, and what we have is one of the finest speculative dramas ever produced.",989884800,7,1297,4.967741935483871

The behind the scenes gets its' own disc, the extra footage and effects gets its' own disc, ""The Final Cut"" gets its' own disc.  Here is where the problem comes in, the original version from 1982, the international version also from 1982, and the director's cut from 1992 are all squeezed onto one disc.  That is probably why it constantly freezes up when I try to play it.  All I wanted was the original 1982 version but Mr. Scott's ego forces us to buy either this set or the newer 5 disc set which includes a rough cut of the movie.  This is the only way to get the original version.  I will probably watch the other discs once then never again, how many times do you need to see the behind the scenes stuff.  Either way I feel I still don't have what I want because I am sure this freezing up problem is a disc problem and not a DVD player problem.  On this disc, disc #3, all versions have freezing problems on the same scenes.  Even though the price is priced for a single DVD why can't these directors stop being ball breakers and release single versions?  Mr. Scott does an intro for these films and when he talks about the 1982 theatrical version you get the feeling from his tone that it is here it is now choke on it.  You get the impression that he hates the movie and he will grudgingly, give you barbarians it crammed onto a disc with the other two films.  Why doesn't Warner Brothers take back control over their property?  I have enjoyed many of Mr. Scott's movies but what he is doing to the 1982 theatrical version is a shame.

This 'Cut' of the film is more in the way of what the director intended it to be as opposed to what the executives/studios wanted. The narration and 'happy ending' that spoilt the original release have thankfully been removed. This makes for a more intelligent and thought provoking film.

110247,5,0790729628,"Dark science fiction adventure set in the year 2019 about a special police-operations officer who hunts down five artificial humans in Los Angeles.  Harrison Ford stars in the main role as Deckard, a ""Bladerunner"" policeman who specializes in hunting down ""Replicants.""  The Replicants are artificial humans manufactured by the Tyrell Corporation, used for hazardous duties in off-world exploration in place of humans.  Replicants have become violently dangerous due to self-realization of their situation, resulting in bloody rebellions against their human owners.  As a result, they're declared illegal on Earth, under penalty of death.  Bladerunner is about the particular case of five who return after escaping from an off-world colony, and try to penetrate the Tyrell Corporation for unknown reasons.  Deckard is retired, having lost taste for his work, and is forced by the Bladerunner unit to take the assignment of running down the five escaped replicants.

Released in 1982, the movie boasts impressive visual effects that hold up quite well with today's productions that enjoy digital animation.  The model effects create a massive Los Angeles metropolis of super skyscrapers, millions of lights, neon signs, floating blimps, and flying cars crisscrossing the impressive skyline.  Ridley Scott created an eye-catching atmosphere by looking back 40 years in history to determine the look of architecture and clothing.  The outcome is a timeless appearance that is not mottled with `80's techno-punk.  While being futuristic, it maintains a classic detective-story flavor.

The movie received mixed reviews after it first opened, probably due to audiences' expectations of another `Stars Wars' action adventure with Harrison Ford.  Instead they got a deep and dark story of a man [Deckard] hunting down artificial humans who are looking for an answer to their existence.  Midway through the story, Deckard himself begins to develop emotions for the replicants' plight.  Rutger Hauer, a Dutch actor who was at the height of his career in the U.S., stars as the replicants' leader Roy Batty, and turns in an exceptional performance.  Eleven years later, the Director's version was released in theaters and is one of the few movies to have enjoyed such a success, differing from the original 1982 release by excluding Harrison Ford's narrative and a `happy ending' sequence, and the addition of an unusual unicorn scene.  Curiously there are no extra features such as deleted scenes or the trailer, which is particularly interesting since it shows scenes never used in the final release.

Bladerunner is one of the better movies in the science fiction category, both in content and visual creation.  A `must own' for Sci-Fi fans.",987724800,3,2734,5.390588235294118
110248,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's famous novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?"", is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to retire five genetically engineered syborgues, known as ""Replicants"". In 1982, the director, Ridley Scott, found himself at the center of a storm around his production of Blade Runner. After clashes with studio executives over the film's complex content and downbeat finale, Scott added a voiceover narration and a more positive ending. But ""Blade Runner"" fell victim to negative reviews and a poor box office. It wasn't until the early 1990s that the director's cut, the final version, was finally released on videocassette, and the film was recognized as a science-fiction masterpiece...
  Born in England in 1937, Ridley Scott were one of the most promising directors of the late 1970s with films like ""The Duellists"" (1977) that won the Jury Prize for Best First Feature at the Cannes Film Festival and, above all, ""Alien"" (1979), the first episode of the famous tetralogy. Directing ""Blade Runner"" in 1982, he certainly realised his career masterpiece. About twenty years later, we can affirm he is a great and an eclectic director who has tackled many kinds of film as the historical epic (""Gladiator"" / 2000 / five Academy Awards, one of whom was the best director award for Scott), the historic film (""1492 : Conquest of Paradise"" / 1992), the road movie (""Thelma & Louise"" / 1991) or also the science-fiction film (""Blade Runner"" / ""Alien"").  Blade Runner's actors and actresses are also pretty good ones especially Harrison Ford. This one acted in about 50 movies : among them, the most famous are ""Star Wars"" (1977), the ""Indiana Jones"" (1981, 1984 and 1989), ""Witness"" (1985), ""Mosquito Coast"" (1986) or also ""The Fugitive"" (1993). Though they are not pretty famous, the actor Rutger Hauer who acted the leader of the five replicants and the actresses Sean Young who acted an android and Daryl Hannah, a replicant, are also exceptionnal in this movie.
  I suggest you a short summary of Blade Runner : in a cyberpunk vision of the future, man has developed the technology to create replicants, human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth but with fixed lifespans. In Los Angeles, 2019, Deckard is a ""Blade Runner"", a cop who specialises in terminating replicants. Originally in retirement, he is forced to re-enter the force when five replicants escape from an offworld colony to Earth. Man's obsession with creating a being equal to himself has back-fired.
  In order to conclude, I will try to make a review of this marvellous masterpiece named ""Blade Runner"".  On top of being well-directed and well-adapted from this great book of Dick, this movie can enjoy a splendid original soundtrack by the famous composer Vangelis, who also arranged the soundtracks of ""the Chariots of Fire"" (he won an Oscar) and ""1492"", that consists mainly in jazz and blues illustrating perfectly the dark atmosphere of Scott's movie. Concerning the dialogues, the lasts lines of the replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) are engraved on my memory forever :
""Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. I've seen things... you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams... glitter in the dark near the Tannhuser Gate. All those moments will be lost... in time... like tears... in the rain.""
  Moreover, the special effects are exceptionnal especially in the opening credits : the best sci-fi scene I have ever seen (tied with the ending of ""Blade Runner"") ! The texts, the apocalyptic pan of Los Angeles then the interrogation ... I think that I was very clear about this film. Watch it ! Everybody can watch it because it questions what it is to be human and why life is so precious.",987724800,4,3928,4.893233082706767
110249,5,0790729628,"Directed by Ridley Scott, possibly the best director in Hollywood, Blade Runner: The Director's cut is an outstanding medley of action, noir, sci-fi, and suspense.  Robots have been taken to a new level - Nexus 6 Generation Robots called ""replicants"", which outmatch humans in strength and ability and equal in intelligence, but lack one human quality - emotions.  They were used for ""slave labor"" to work in places too hazardous for humans.  However, replicants after a few years begin to develop their own emotions, which causes them to rebel against their masters.  Special cops, called blade runners, were assigned to exterminate criminal replicants.  Eventually replicants were declared illegal on earth, and were banished to a shuttle in space.  LA, 2017.  Rick Deckard, (Harrison Ford) a retired blade runner, is forced to ""retire"" five replicants that have escaped from the shuttle, but winds up falling for one, Rachael. (Sean Young) Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) leads the other three replicants to find their creator, Eldon Tyrell, to expand their short four-year life span.  Incredible action scenes, dark, brooding noir, creeping suspense, and excellent sci-fi, Blade Runner: The Director's Cut will please fans of any of these genres.  The Director's Cut offers production notes, subtitles, added character developement, the original ending, a unicorn dream sequence, and the deletion of unnecessary scenes and the annoying voice-overs.  Plus, it is digitally restored to excellent picture and sound quality.  Some ""sensitive"" viewers might find the plot and noir atmosphere cold, but action, noir, sci-fi, and suspense fans will enjoy it very much.

The DC removed much vital information, like the background to the exchange when Decker is picked up to be forced back into work as a BR.  The DC also inserted an idiotic scene of a unicorn trapsing through a glade - looked like it was lifted directly from ""Legend.""
I would venture that some preponderance of the intelligentsia expressing preference for the DC saw the OV first, thus they have already been exposed to the background info before seeing the DC.  If you see the DC first, good luck.  I wouldn't recommend seeing the DC at all.  The OV is one of my favorite films.

You would have thought that at least the alternative ending would be on the disk, but sadly there are few extras.
Since there were so many possibilites for the DVD edition of the film it is disappointing that Scott and the Studio couldn't make a better product.

110256,5,0790729628,"I look at this film with both a postive and a negative eye. Usually, I wouldn't say a bad thing about this movie, but when writting a review, I must look at both sides. Lets start with somthing simple, like pros and cons.
Pros: Effects that still hold water today. Great acting. Deep and emotional plot. Very intense. Artistic value is unsurpassed.
Cons: Hard to follow sometimes. Some of the scenes are a little slow paced at times. Overall it's just a little to wierd.
Now that were passed that let's review the plot:
Sometime in the not so distant future, we created Replicants or ""Skin Jobs"" to fight our wars, preform covert operations, and due our laundry(just kidding!). kind of like drones, to do our dirty work. of course, we created these miracle machines with far greated strength and acrobatic talents than we have. But replicants were made to copy humans in every way, exept their emotions, you see we made these machines to form their own emotions. But the scientist who created them feared these robot/clones would at some point rebel, So the they decided to creat and expiration date for all replicants, spanning a mear 4 years. Just as the scientist feared, these mechanical saviors turned into mechanical nightmares. The goverment decided to outlaw all replicants, skin jobs were offically outlawed and were shot on sight. We were able to contain most of them but quit a few still romed free, and they even created more. These robots blended quit nicely with the public. Remeber they were made to copy the human race in virtually every way.....................exept their emotions. We began having alot of trouble hunting these renagade bots down. Thus, an alite group of law enforcement officers call Blade Runner units were formed. And to go along with that, we created a test desinged to trick a replicant into giving his identity away by toying with it's emotions. Enter Deckard, a retired Blade Runner unit. Time passed, we got rid of all but four of the menacing clones. Deckards old chief offers him the assingment of killing these four in turn for......nothing? Dust though sense a plot hole? The movie centers on these four reps, and Deckards love interest, who may be a rep herself! Deckard searches, Deckard finds, Deckard shoots, happy ending right? Wrong, The ending is dark and depressing. I won't give it away to you! Do you think im a blabber mouth who doesent know when to shut up?! If you have read all this seemingly endless review.....your right!
Overall: A great sci-fi classic, worth not only renting but investing 17 bucks to this fine website to own this masterpiece. (I won't say how much I was paid to say that:) Whoa amazon! Only kidding!",983318400,2,2683,4.809523809523809

The title score resonates through my being as if acquiring a tangible presence, and could almost be sniffed or tasted.

110259,5,0790729628,"About this movie all has been written, in this site too, and in very interesting ways. I would like propose a personal reading.
I start from afar : who is the most famous and loved Don Juan? That by Tirso da Molina? Not, he is often quoted but less known. That by Moliere? Not, he is acute too.
On!, that by Mozart and Da Ponte! Here really, through ""the  most beautiful music in the world"" and a libretto etched on our memory, we understand Don Juan became a modern hero, he is not the complacent cavalier and the philanderer, but the competing of prissiness and of the foregone life. And women? They are the battlefield of Don Juan!
Sure, but attention, please: in the Mozart's opera Don Juan can't manage one performance. We cannot understand what has happened with Anna, and she will be anyway his fall; Elvira hates him; Zerlina, after an engagement, at last dodges...we ca know all the skill of Don Juan only by means of the Leporello's explanations, for the rest we see a hero even on the point of being dominated.
2019 in Los Angeles, captain Bryant explains us Deckard is the best hunter of androids: really he is  a magician! But after who can we see? A tired hero, with the perplexed look of Harrison Ford; this character is in the movie less old and bruise than in the Dick's book, but in the movie he is more inconclusive and unawares vulnerable  than in the book.
Deckard has to erase six androids: Zora is on the point of strangling him but she is diverted by others; Leon is killing him, but Rachel saves Deckard; Pris has already won, but she want to kill him trough her favourite blow, the somersault , and let him the time to save himself; Roy ridicules him and with greatness pardons him. Deckard falls in love with Rachel (the wonderful SeanYoung), the fifth android, and so he solves the problem.  (Yes , the androids have to be six...but this is the mystery of the movie: who is the sixth?)
Both Don Juan the Cavalier had to hide himself, to flee, to disguise himself, and above all was so inept with women....and Deckard the Hunter takes hails of punches, loses his teeth, has two broken fingers...Both do not hunt, but they are hunted and have to run off. One goes at hell by choice, other change his life by love.
The very simple story, the visions, the colours, the music and the last words (""tears in the rain"")  produces this movie one of the best in the world. I advise the ""Director's cut""",982108800,2,2420,4.45372460496614

110263,4,0790729628,"This is a film whose meaning changes with time. When it came out it was soft science-fiction and adventure. Ten years later it is completely different. Cloning men to produce slaves, with no past, no emotional growing, no infancy, no memories but also with a limited lifespan was a vague menace ten years ago. Today it is a reality. This cloning implies DNA manipulation and this is today perfectly possible. Then the film gets some renewed interest. If those clones have no past, they have no emotions, hence they are machines. Yet they are stronger than and as intelligent as normal people, which means they develop emotions on the basis of their present experience, hence they rebel because they want an answer to their fundamental question, viz. what is life and what is the meaning of their lives and the meaning of their early deaths. When they do not get those answers, they kill the boss of the corporation who produced them, their  father , rediscovering or reinventing the dipus complex. Then the film is no longer an adventure film but an ethically rebellious film. Bladerunners are those who chase and hunt the replicants that have dared come on earth. They don't kill them, they retire them. Ethically unacceptable because they are human, just like us. And this unethical action is emphasized by three elements : the disgust and sickness of the bladerunner of the film in front of killing  human beings , even if they are replicants ; the last act of the last and dying replicant that saves the bladerunner's life to have a witness to his death, to maybe show life is more important than death for him, or even his survival ; the love affair that develops into an elopement with the new generation of replicants who do no have any limitation on their lifespan. Replicants are able to develop feelings and emotions, to become human, even if it is not based on those simple things that are called puberty, adolescence, growth, family life, father and mother, etc. A human  machine  will necessarily develop a human psyche. This is particularly disquieting for us and it should make us think twenty times before trying to be God. Like God who was unable to prevent disobedience in his free-will beings, we will be unable to prevent human development in our intelligent creations. And these beings will overtake us. This is yet shorter than the same problem in the Dune novels, because the Duncans are created, cloned from the DNA of the original dead one, but they recuperate with that DNA all the memories of the original Duncan. DNA has a memory. And then the problem is the discrepancy between what the cloned Duncan remembers and what the world he is thrown into is. This questioning about clones will go on and will become more and more pressing and pregnant in the coming years.

110264,5,0790729628,"Loosely based on the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" by Philip K.Dick, Blade Runner is a landmark in SF film making. It is set in a near future in which great technological advances have merely brought their own problems rather than delivered some form of utopia. The particular problem of concern in this movie is that of replicants. These near perfect copies of humans are not allowed on Earth and when a small group lands illegally, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is called out of retirement to dispose of them.
As the hunt continues, he finds himself becoming attached on Rachel, one of the replicants whom he has been sent to destroy. Where will his loyalties lie?
This film works and appeals on many levels. Of course, superficially there is the thriller aspect of the movie. Will Deckard kill the bad guys? Will he get the girl? Will she be allowed to live? But there is also the dark display of the future world. Something such as this is far more convincing that the sort of slick clean and perfect future that seems to be the view of most prior works in this genre.
Finally, there comes the whole matter of identity. Can the replicants really love? Should their lives be valued as much as those of the humans and finally, the big question raised by the film, is Deckard a human or a replicant given false memories and sent out to kill his own kind?
This last matter caused a lot of controversy. In the original book, Dick feels that the matter is sufficiently important that he has Deckard submit to tests to prove that he is human. The movie is more ambiguous. Many year after making the film, director Ridley Scott claimed that Deckard was a replicant. Reports from the shooting of the film say that there was a dispute between the director and his star. Ford wanted the audience to be with Deckard and did not want conclusive evidence that the killer was a replicant. It is this very ambiguity and the questions that it raises that is at the heart of the film's enduring popularity.
The movie is available in two different versions. The original version has a Raymond Chandler style voice over narrative done by Ford. This was forced on the director by the film's financial backers who feared that audiences would not follow the plot. The subsequent ""director's cut"" version drops this and adds a single dream sequence scene which is designed to reinforce the impression that Deckard is a replicant.
In an ideal world, you could buy a DVD with both versions on it but sadly, you cannot do this. In that case, the director's cut version is truer to the intentions of the films creators and it is inevitable that anyone watching the earlier version will feel that they are missing something.",980726400,8,2712,4.64033264033264

The movie is slow without much plot and character development, and contains entirely too little action for a movie of it's theme. The music I think is terrible - I wished someone would've rescored the whole movie. The art direction is very good although some special effects are less than par (too often you see cars suspended from cables). The dvd is about as bare as you can get, containing basically no extras - even the ""jump to a scene"" option only gives about 9 ""jumping in"" places, about every 3-6 chapters. It should at least have the theatrical trailer which is standard on nearly all dvds. I find the fact that the dvd contained both the standard and widescreen versions to be a plus though.

110268,4,0790729628,"Harrison Ford has created an amazing number of memorable roles in his career but one of the most understated of these was in ""Blade Runner"". He plays a cop called Deckard who is responsible for ""retiring"" rogue replicants, genetically engineered beings who are used by humanity in all those tasks which are dull, distasteful or dangerous. These futuristic slaves have abilities that are beyond the mere human but pay for it with very limited life-spans.
Ridley Scott adapted the film from the Philip K Dick novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep."" Scott is famous for cinematic visuals and whilst he doesn't stick very closely to the book, the overall design and special effects make this a ground breaking science fiction film. Released in 1982 it took the ""gritty Sci-Fi"" crown from ""Alien,"" Scott's film from three years earlier.  The world in 2019 is over populated, crime is rampant, the Japanese own the economy and most animal species are extinct. This is not an unnatural projection from an early eighties perspective.
Before I get too heavily into the narrative, I'd like to touch on the sensitive issue of version envy. The history of Blade Runner takes at least two turns. The initial theatrical release had less than brilliant exit polling. Apparently cinema goers thought it was confusing and too dark. The studio forced Scott to make changes, including Deckard's voice-over and a more upbeat ending. More recently, the directors cut transformed the film back into it's original format with a few extra minutes to flesh out some of the important relationships. In my opinion, both versions are worth watching.
The film focuses on Deckard for the most part. He is the character the audience most identifies with,  since he is apathetic and cynical by turns, as he goes through the motions of his meaningless existence. That is, until he meets his first Nexus 6 replicant, Rachael, who is posing as the niece of Eldon Tyrell, the genius (owner of the Tyrell Corporation, manufacturer of the Nexus 6 line). Rachael Tyrell(?) is played to perfection by Sean Young. She is not aware of her inhumanity and, thanks to implanted memories, plays her part so well she almost passes Deckard's replicant test. The poignancy of her enlightenment is not lost on the audience, nor is it lost on Deckard. Their reluctant attraction forms one of the stronger sub-plots in the film.
The first half of the story made me wonder if there was going to be any plot at all. Mind you, the setting was sumptuous and therefore enjoyable enough to mask the lack. We had glimpses of the group of Replicants Deckard was hunting but it is not until Roy Batty enters the picture in full, that we start to wonder if Deckard can pull it off. Roy, intensely played by Rutger Hauer, is a military model; strong, fast, smart  and persistent. He is the leader of the escaped replicants and has come to earth on a mission of his own. Like many of us, he does not want to die and is intent on infiltrating the Tyrell Corporation in the hope that some way can be found to side-step the untimely fate of all replicants.
The film is rich in symbolism and flooded with small but detailed characters like the origami artist Gaff. But the true heart of the story is the moral grey area. Can a good man condone what amounts to slavery? Is there no moral limit to genetic engineering? Is love possible between a man and a construct? Must we condemn a man for wanting to live, at any cost?
In the end, when Roy has Deckard dead-to-rights on a crumbling and rain-swept roof, he says, ""All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain."" Roy allows Deckard to live, even as he dies, leaving us with the conclusion that Roy's only way to live past his use-by date, is through the memory of the man who set out to kill him.",979689600,20,3797,4.681137724550898
110269,5,0790729628,"Maybe the worst mistake in the history of film-making was releasing ""Blade Runner"" with a 'happy' ending.  The ending in the theatrical version basically destroyed much of the meaning of the movie.  Fortunately, Ridley Scott saw to it that there was a video release of the 'real,' restored ending, which is this, the director's cut.
This movie is one of the most impressive movies ever made.  It combines a great plot, awesome acting, deep characters and spectacular special effects.  Put simply, there is nothing wrong with this movie, and everything is very right.  Harrison Ford deliver's the performance of a lifetime, and is complimented nicely by Sean Young.  But Rutger Hauer steals the show providing some of the finest acting ever captured on film.

Now, there are other great looking sci-fi movies out there (Star Wars), but this movie does not have a simple good vs. bad theme. S.W. was an excellent vision of the future, but for adults it lacks the ""grey"" areas of human existence. It also lacked adult passions. NOT BLADERUNNER. In this movie, the essence of what it means to be human is questioned, love between a man and a ""woman"" is explored, and androids wrestle with the idea of death. Humans have wrestled with these matters since the beginning of time, and seeing them projected into humans (and non-humans) in the future are what really make this film work.

110273,5,0790729628,"""Blade Runner"" relies on two tremendous driving forces. The heralded visuals which have been imitated countlessly over the years, not just in science fiction, but music video, thrillers and commercials. While Blade Runner itself borrows a few elements from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", it distances itself from the great German piece with a realism that is uncharacteristically grounded (pun intended) for science fiction.
The startling thing about Blade Runner is that every year that passes by, Los Angeles bears a closer resemblance to this skin grafting, smog congested, racist society that was projected by novelist Philip K. Dick, director Ridley Scott, visualist Syd Mead and screenwriters Hampton Fancher and David Peoples. Organ and tissue implants are better known today as plastic surgery. LA is a town in which such an emphasis is placed on physical appearance. Inevitably, clones created from a superior genetic stock would arise in a society such as this.
The Director's Cut gives the smoky and towering visuals more breathing room and the subtleties of Ridley Scott's detail come to light. The central conflict and irony of this film is that you have a sardonic Humphrey Bogart disenchanted Blade Runner commissioned to seek and retire all androids, regardless of their own personal involvement in a crime that was committed Off-World. This forces the androids to kill in order not to be killed.
Just who is the true protaganist of this film? Deckard is just doing his job, and is, for the most part, a static character. One moment largely affected by the additional unicorn scene is when he finds the origami unicorn on the floor. This is one of the few intuitive moments where Deckard reflects on the human nature of his own being. The unicorn is a dream that Deckard imagines, and dreams are our own to treasure and fear. The origami folding Gaff places the very mythical creature in his dreams. He dissects Deckard's mind much in the same manner that Deckard smashes Rachael's precious childhood memories.
I could go on much longer, but for the sake of this recommendation, I hope the complexity of this story speaks for itself. It is emotional in a deep sense and the visuals are stunning for its time. Many of the model techniques and wire effects outdo its contemporary rivals who utilize digital effects. They are close to 20 years old, and still drop jaws all across the world.",978566400,4,2399,5.0

110278,4,0790729628,"Before director's cuts became a mainstream phenomenon and every other movie being released starting carrying that label for leaving in five extra seconds of unneeded footage, Blade Runner was rereleased as Ridley Scott's original and far superiour vision. A cult following bloomed into a not-just-cult following and fans everywhere rejoiced.
Blade Runner was filmed in the early eighties, before Return of the Jedi was released, and with effects that play just as well today as they did back in the heyday of the sci-fi special effects revolution. Scott's portrayal of a dark, often-raining, overcrowded LA is a thrill to watch as the scenes, blessedly free from the distracting narrative of the first theater release, pan slowly across the bizarre archetechture of the near future. The storyline is good, and gives the characters time to develop with the help of some brilliant acting, but it's the visual magic that puts Blade Runner in the much-deserved spot of ""Best Science Fiction Movie Ever.""
This is one movie that should ONLY be seen in it's director's cut. Only then can you truly appreciate the dark hopelessness of the world where synthetic beings are hunted down just for trying to live. It's dirty, it's dark, it's unkind, and it needs to be seen without the studio's unwelcome brightening up and spoonfed explanations. Much better to spend your attention and energy trying to figure out whether or not Decker is a replicant, or if the rogue band of replicants can survive.
As has been pointed out, the DVD itself is short on extras. That's unfortunate. But maybe that's because the focus is supposed to be on the movie itself.

110279,5,0790729628,"Let's start off by saying that ""Blade Runner"" has more intellegence and imagination than any Star Wars or Star Trek movie ever made.  Perhaps this is because it is based on a Phillip K. Dick novel, Dick being one of the smartest people ever to write science fiction.  The movie, rather than dumbing down Dick's work as Hollywood is so often prone to do, instead celebrates it.  Harrison Ford's hero is really Phillip Marlowe transported to the space age.  The whole movie in fact has a ""film noir"" feel to it that enhances its downcast mood.  Ford gives what maybe the best ACTING performance of his career.  And Dick's scary vision of the future is perfectly portrayed.
The Drector's cut has a more ambiguous ending than the original film and throws out Ford's added on narrative designed to ""assist"" audiences that the producers thought would be too dumb to follow the story otherwise.  While I never minded the narration, the more uncertain ending is far more appropriate.  Either way, sci-fi movies don't get any better than this.",976320000,3,1034,4.80225988700565
110280,5,0790729628,"Blade Runner is my favorite science fiction film. Everything about it, from its exceptional music and script to its brilliant direction; oozes with substance and style.
The screenplay, by Hampton Fancher and Philip K. Dick, is intelligently written and has a good mix of drama, action, and science fiction. The dialogue is smart, philosophical, and meaningful.
The cast does a fine job at bringing voice to the script. Harrison Ford delivers a fine performance as the troubled Blade Runner, Rick Deckard. Rutger Hauer gives the best performance of the film, though. Hauer plays the replicant, Roy Batty, whom is searching for a way to prolong his life. He delivers his lines with cold-menace and a sorrowful undertone. Sean Young and Daryl Hannah also give noteworthy performances.
Ridley Scott is in top form here. As in Alien, he shows us that he has a very fine eye for details. His vision of Los Angeles in 2019 is frightening gritty and dark.
Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography is extraordinary. His use of lighting is quite effective and intriguing.
Vangelis's jazzy blues music suits the images on screen nicely and adds a lot of soul to the film.
The legendary, gothic, and often imitated set design of Blade Runner is incredible and helps in creating a sense of doom and in bringing Ridley Scott's vision to life.
Like so many films that have now attained classic status, Blade Runner was panned by both critics and audiences upon its release. I suppose people just weren't ready to see Harrison Ford in a film-noir and to see a science fiction film with this much power and grit.

110281,5,0790729628,"When I first saw ""Blade Runner"" in 1982, I was literally blown away by the film's amazing production design, dazzling visual effects, and suprisingly human story. Quite simply, ""Blade Runner"" is the best dystopian vision ever put on film, and raises questions about the true meaning of humanity.
The director's cut of ""Blade Runner"" simply improves on a classic with a bit more character background and the elimination of Harrison Ford's horrid faux-noir narration. Best yet, the silly ""drive in the country"" happy ending, mandated by studio bosses, also ends up in the trash can, replaced by a much neater ending in which Decker the hunter becomes the hunted.
When I heard that Harrison Ford's narration (such as it is) was being removed for the director's cut, I wondered how the film's wandering narrative would work, but after viewing the revised version, I find it just as easy to follow as the original.
The visual effects also hold up extremely well 18 years later, even when compared to today's computer-generated graphics, a real testament to the skill and vision of their creators.
One of the main criticisms of this film is that it portrays a dark, dank Los Angeles that could never really exist, but that's why they call it ""science fiction,"" folks. Go with it. And before you dismiss this film's vision of a future Los Angeles so easily, look at the ethnic mix in this film - a mismash of white people, Asians, Hispanics and other groups. Is that really so far removed from the real Los Angeles of today?

The wonderfully talented Harrison Ford gives as good a performance as the ""look exhausted, now look scared, now look exhausted again"" direction allows, but are we really supposed to believe that he'd fall for an utterly unattractive Sean Young?

A moody and dark picture, it captures a pretty bleak image of the future, but carries some touching sentiments about the endearing qualities and failures of human beings, and the films climax is both touching and memorable. Initially a little disjointed at the beginning of the picture, and at times surreal in directorial quality it is nonetheless an exceptional movie, with an excellent script, and cast - Sean Young plays the very beautiful romantic interest, and there are also some early outings for Daryl Hannah, and Rutgar Hauer.

I wasn't old enough to have seen the original theatrical release in theatres, but after watching it on video, I must say that the director's cut is the better of the two, even if the ending is less ""happy"". The happy ending didn't seem to fit well with the rest of the movie's tone, which to be honest, had very little that was positive to say about the future of the human race. I find this approach to be more honest, serving perhaps as a veiled warning about the potential consequences of recklessly pursuing ever-greater knowledge and technology.
Personally, I found that Ford's narratives took away from the atmosphere that Ridley had so carefully created - dark, rainy, and very subtle, with lots of detail that is not immediately present (look carefully for the ad signs of non-existent companies - Pan Am and Atari, to name a couple) on first viewing.
I was disappointed that the technological capabilities of the DVD format were largely ignored, particularly where sound was concerned - with 5.1 channels of Dolby Digital to work with, they made little use of it. It would've definitely enhanced the film to become fully immersed in Ridley's dark, busy and at times jarring depiction of Los Angeles in 2019.

Yet I found myself watching it again and again on video and now once on DVD. The more I watched it the more I learned to appreciated it, and now regard it as probably one of the most intriguing movies to come out of Hollywood ever.  The essential story: After thousands of years of civil existance humankind now has developed technology to such a degree that he/she is able to create life in his/her own image(sound familiar?). But can humankind handle that level of power. Responsibility and advanced technology, synonymous? What happens when the created seeks the creator to ask for more? The director of the movie takes this situation and translates it into an incredible piece of highly detailed audio visual work. 2019 LA, rain, over population and confusion- a new world awaits them. The means to create life synthetically while most of the natural population seems to be able to just get by... even in this technologically advanced future.  I gave the DVD version only 2 stars. Why? I have seen all versions and conclude to subscribe only to the European. It is the least cut and most original. In addition, the Directors Cut lacks, in certain ways, the effect of the original.

Rutger Hauer plays one of these robots and its one of his best roles ever. Needless to say, Harrison Ford plays superbly.

The most powerful scene in the movie is when Rutger's replicant-killer gains self-awareness on the rooftop battling Harrison Ford. In the rain, he remarks how as an expendable entity he has gone to the ends of the universe on suicide missions with noone caring or remembering, and then when its all said and done, he will cease to exist. Then, as the rain drops fall, HE CHOOSES to rescue Harrison Ford, anyway. If that is not by definition, HUMANITY, heroism, and LOVE, then what is it? He CHOSE to be alive, to care. By so doing he exceeds the humanity of some of us. If you don't shed a tear for him and wish he were human, then maybe YOU are a replicant. This is where the cynics miss the point.
The natural response of a human would be to as soon as the crisis was over to CHOSE LIFE--to grab the girl, get away and LIVE while you can and be thankful for what you have, which is what Ford does in the original movie but not the avante garde ""director's cut"".

110294,4,0790729628,"Ridley's Scott's Director's Cut is science fiction at its finest, and it's one of the few films that I view on a regular basis.  The final scene between Batty and Deckard remains one of the most poignant moments in cinema for me.  As for the implication that Deckard might be a Replicant, as the unicorn dream suggests to some, I find the notion mere whimsy.  To me, the whole point as well as the heart of the story is Batty's evolution to humanity along with Deckard's reawakening to his own humanity, as evidenced by Batty's ultimate compassionate act and Deckard's soulful wordlessness toward that act.  I do agree that an edition should be released containing the Director's Cut as well as the original version, perhaps even the unrated original version where the viewer is able to witness Tyrell's skull being crushed.  As much as the Director's Cut is unquestionably superior in my mind, the original would allow for entertaining comparisons between the two, and itself is far from a bad film once you subtract the dreadfully upbeat ending.  It took numerous viewings of the Director's Cut before I grew accustomed to not hearing Deckard's voice-over narration; it was a nice, if unnecessary, touch.

 Blade Runner,  in the Director's Cut is a true Sci-Fi classic. Watch Scott's true vision  of the film on DVD and hope that the original theatrical version has been  burned, never to be seen again.

110300,5,0790729628,"Top-notch action packed sci-fi by the same director that made `Aliens'.  `Blade Runner' is one of those rare films that mixes thought provoking  science fiction with a `film noir' edge. Along with `Brazil', the most  stunning, original and most probable vision of an apocalyptic future. The  film is intoxicatingly heavy on atmosphere. Amazing special effects bring  to life an apocalyptic neon-drenched futuristic Los Angeles. Filled with a  unique brooding `noir' atmosphere, a rare thing in sci/fi films. Even the  memorable score is contemporarily jazzy. Harrison Ford had just become a  star with `The Empire Strikes Back' and `The Raiders Of The Lost Ark', just  two and one year earlier respectively. This was a brilliant career move but  unlike those two past films, the role of Deckard was no star-making  machine. Ford's brooding presence really helps and he makes for a  compelling and memorable Deckard. As with almost all great `noir', the film  has a private-eye/murder-mystery plot involving mutinying `replicants' on  earth who must be eliminated by the best of the `Blade Runners' that  happens to be Ford. Rutger Hauer and Darryl Hannah are great as two of the  replicants. Based on the thought-provoking Philip K. Dick story `Do  Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. The action-packed ending is a  knock-out, this is really intense action not just `cops and robbers' or  `good guys vs. bad guys' action this is real adrenaline pumping stuff. You  really start to fear for Deckard and Rutger Hauer really seems like an  indestructible superhuman force. This is what I most look up to when I see  the film, I just think the ending is expertly shot and edited for maximum  impact. The director's cut was released in 1993, making for a much better,  adding a little more character development and a more dark and unsettling  ending and eliminating Ford's tedious voice-over narration. This more  unsettling ending loosely implies that Deckard himself may be a replicant  hits you out of nowhere and leaves a memorable impact and one that you will  think off for at least weeks to come.

The scenery and dark theme match well to create the mood of  the movie, set in a dark, seemingly run down, futuristic Earth.
Harrison  plays a retired Blade Runner who is sucked back into service to stop  renegade replicants. Even with the movie's age nearing twenty years, Blade  Runner is a solid movie even today. The Director's cut forgoes some  voiceover work that bridged a few gaps for viewers that had trouble keeping  up, as well as adding some cut footage.
Rutger Hauer does a commendable  job as the leader of the band of replicants, who are gaining too much free  will to remain docile. This is a classic movie that should be a definate  addition to the collection of any Harrison fans, or Rutger fans for that  matter.

Harrison Ford delivers  what I think is one of his best performances in this movie, and Rutger  Hauer is a fantastic villan, particularly becuase of the character's  vulnerability.

Set in 21st century Los Angeles, Blade  Runner  creates a totally convincing world of neon-lit cityscapes  peopled by strangely-clad urbanites, who seem more robot than  human, and then pits Harrison Ford against a  group of renegade  replicants (androids that are almost  indistinguishable from  humans), who have escaped from an  off-world colony. On its  initial release the film's main attraction  were the astounding  visual effects, the complex themes contained  within the  narrative alienating the vast majority who saw it. Over  the  years, however, a cult has grown around Blade Runner, where  it  seems to have satisfied a need for ""harder"", more intellectual  science fiction in the wake of Star Wars and its seemingly  endless  hybrids. Looking back, it is clear that Scott's film  was years ahead  of its time.
Culminating in a monstrous,  violent, affecting and magnificent finale, Blade Runner stands shoulder to  shoulder with the most ambiguous and visionary of films. An incredible  experience on every level, though the impact is undeniably diminished on  video, Scott's scarily prophetic tale appreciates substantially with repeat  viewing.

The dark atmosphere makes the movie so enjoyable, and quite sad  thou', because it shows masterfully the human emotions; and androids, and  what the future could be. Dark, dirty, clouded, wasted...
So to the  story. It tells a story of a retired Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, who is  chosen back to his job; to take another droid-hunt. ( This is not action  -movie, so I thought, but I wasn't disappointed; this is better like it is  ) So he takes the job, and you'll see what happens. The story is multiple,  and hard to understand at first ( maybe easier for those who have readed  the book ), but it makes it re-watchable.

having said that, i think this is a  great film. based very loosely on Phillip K. Dick's 'Do Andriods Dream of  Electric Sheep,' it is a story of a burnt out Bladerunner (special units  that track down and 'retire' rouge android/replicants) on the pursuit of  renegade replicants. as noted by many reviewers, this is a detective movie  -- a futuristic film noir.
made in 1982 the look of this film still  impresses. set in the near future (latter 21st century) against a teeming,  oppressive, dark and ultra-urban Los Angeles, there is a real sense of a  believable world -- everything from the costumes to the shots of the city,  to even the advertisements are consistant.
after all these years, the  special effects in this film are still good simply because Ridley Scott  didn't relied heavily on it. ultimately, and especially in the Director's  Cut version, the film centers around the internal issue concerning the  separation of man and machine (yeah, corny i know but it works here) and  challenging the validity of one's perception.

Deckard  narrating the story was what made this movie unique: it was not a mere  science fiction, it was a story someone from a (probable ?) future was  telling me, citizen of the past (his past), warning me about loosing the  faith or trusting too much in Science. There should be a place for humanity  as shown by the last replicant while in his ""time to die"". I felt  like I was inside Deckard's heart and soul while he was narrating his  story, trying to explain why he killed and why he did not feel good  killing, but doing it.

Scott killed the soul of this movie (if  you saw Babylon 5, which uses the same ""narrating"" approach, you  will understand why B5 is so special).

110318,5,0790729628,"""Blade Runner"" is, in my mind, one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time.  The movie takes place in the early part of the 21st century.  Harrison Ford plays a cop whose job it is to track down  illegal artificial life forms called ""replicants.""  So, sounds  like just another action /  beat-em up / shoot-em up, right?  Wrong.
This  movie is not an action movie.  It is, if anything, a drama.  It deals with  the 20th century postmodern condition and has many philosophical  implications.  For one, it deals with the rights of artificial life forms  and what, exactly (if anything?) distinguishes them from us;  something  that is not far fetched at all considering the horrifying technology we are  right on the brink of having in regards to microbiology and gene  manipulation.
 The sets are lavish & have a haunting, gothic feel to  them.  The acting, with Harrison Ford in the lead, is top notch.  This is  one of the few movies where I can say that Sean Young turned in a credible  performance.  Also, the soundtrack is by Vangelis;  it is  subtle....stirring....perfect for this movie.

110322,5,0790729628,"Bladerunner is, without a doubt in my mind, one of the best films of the decade, along with Raging Bull and Blue Velvet. A lot of the reviews on this site deal with the original versus the Directors's Cut. I'll say it  simply: The latter is far superior. The director's cut is the version that  was meant to be seen; the original was destroyed by the studio because they  wanted it to have a happy ending and a simple plot. Ridley Scotts's version  takes away the horrid ""happy ending"" and leaves us with the principle  character stumbling upon his ultimate identity. The original had a  ""film noire"" voiceover to help the audience understand the story,  in this version the voiceover is removed and we are left with the silent  hero wondering through the dark city. Also in this version there is a dream  sequence featuring a unicorn running through the forest which is a very  important image in understaning the ending to the film. This is one of the  three greatest science-fiction films of all time, along with Star Wars and  2001. This film is a little different though. While those films were bright  and inspiring, Bladerunner is a dark and nihilistic film, set on an Earth  that is barren and dying and where Coke adds illuminte the city.

This is a classic futuristic film without all  the made-up monsters and gooey gore - it's raw and gritty either way. And  of course, seeing Harrison Ford in an early role, before he became  president of the United States or ``the good doctor'' is an exciting  adventure.

110324,5,0790729628,"Having only seen the director's cut of Blade Runner, I cannot confer whether the original cut proves more cinematically effective.  However, I enjoyed the director's cut for its thorough sensuality, which is very hard  to attain in science fiction.  Harrison Ford is ""one cool cat"",  besides being tossed around a lot.  I loved how Rutger Hauer played a  rutheless yet convincing villain.  Daryl Hannah was a knock-out, as well as  Sean Young (both who played struggling humanoids).  But leaning off the  acting point of view, Blade Runner is more visual than it is action.  The  film conveys futuristic corruption with a shade of beauty rather than  disgust, which narration tends to eliminate (as seen in the original cut).  Blade Runner is a lot like Stanley Kubrick's 2001, except focuses more on  human emotion than human development.  The cinematography delivers pure  artistic excellence; with stunning visual effects and steady cammera  movement.  The action is moderate and the acting may appear slightly bland,  but more than appropriate.  I loved the director's cut of Blade Runner  because of its steady intrigue, that which cheap hollywood endings and  sappy dialogue could never come close to delivering. It's not a very  complex movie, but it does require deep, moral contemplation.  The sound is  ok, as well as the dialogue.  I suggest that anyone yerning for visual as  well as humanistic emmotion buy Blade Runner.  Just sit down, turn on the  VCR, and explore the possibilities.  Enjoy!",962150400,,1506,5.124481327800829
110325,5,0790729628,"Altough upon first viewing of this film, I had been more than frustrated. I had been furious at the film's complete lack of direction and motivation for narrative. After viewing it another four times, trying to break into  the story as much as possible, I realized that trying to do so was futile.  It is not the kind of movie you need to totally understand to appreciate.  Ridley Scott has created some of the most ground-breaking and all out  arresting images in the history of film. It is so very dark, gloomy, and  colorful. Mixing the rainy weather with the bright flourescent lights give  it a unique, nightmarish touch. It has a slower, more restrained tone in  its approach, but when the movie is over, it was very effective. The movie  was advertised all wrong. The director's cut is a movie for the eyes and  for the experience. It is not an all out adventure. I don't think that  there is a bit of action until the very end, with a view jolts here or  there that are scattered throughout the movie. I think that is why I was  initially dissapointed. I was hoping to see an action movie with thrills at  every corner. This is definitly not that movie. This movie is hard for me  to reccomend, because I know alot of people out there will not appreciate  it. This movie is for sci-fi or art house fans. It is a movie that requires  extreme patience and concentration. To alot of people, it will be one giant  mystery. To others, it will be pure magic.",961977600,,1460,4.428571428571429

This is the greatest  movie of any genre ever made, period!  No other film can compare with the  impact Blade Runner has had on my conciousness.  Of course, I am referring  to the Director's Cut, which I have on video.  I have seen the original  version on the Sci-Fi Channel a while back, but I kinda giggled at the  voice-over narration in the beginning (not a good sign), and I found the  original ending (made of outtakes from the opening of The Shining) really  lame.  This only makes me appreciate the Director's Cut even more.  I have  seen the Director's Cut four times (the third on New Year's Day to  celebrate the Y2K-less year 2000; the fourth a week after seeing the  original) and I still feel amazed every time.  The look of the film is  truly a sight to behold; the most beautiful depiction of a future city ever  made!  And without that dumb narration, the story about Deckard and his  assignment to retire replicants Roy Batty, Leon, Zhora and Pris draws you  in easier.  And the new ending has greater impact as the last words stick  with you as the credits role.  Love that Vangelis music score, which  enhances the feel!

110328,1,0790729628,"I won't go into that whole Original Vs. Director's cut debate. My feelings side with the director on this one.
What I can't believe is Warner Bros. treatment of this film. Why re-release ""Blade Runner"" if you're  not going to add anything to the disc? The frame of film, lobby cards and  posters are nice, but as a film enthusiast - and a fan of this one in  particular - I'd much rather have director's commentary, or at least some  trailers or featurettes. Surely a documentary isn't too much to ask for,  considering everything that people seem to NEED to say about the movie.  (There were nearly 300 reviews here alone when I wrote this.)  I can't  believe one of the best and most influential science fiction features of  all time is getting the Paramount DVD treatment! (Star Trek DVDs have  virtually no features either.)
I suggest you save your money and look  through Amazon's book area for a book called ""Future Noir"", as it  appears to be the closest thing we're ever going to get to a documentary or  director commentary.

110329,2,0790729628,"At the risk of receiving hundreds of threatening e-mails, I will go on record stating that Ridley Scott's dystopian vision stands as one of the most unjustifiably praised films since the invention of sound. While  technically marvelous and full of visual invention (it does use noir  influences effectively), the story drags on endlessly and the characters,  especially Ford's, remain aloof, uninteresting, and frustrating. As an  exercise in style, it has undoubted appeal, but it must be heavily  criticized at the screenplay level. When a story is in service to the  visuals, it reflects a lack of confidence at the narrative level. I have  never found Ford to be an appealing actor (he is far too bland to be a  commanding leading man), but at no other time has his character been so  devoid of passion or insight.",960595200,7,818,4.912408759124087
110330,4,0790729628,"This is a review with 3.75 stars, but I rounded up for lack of incremental stars.
First off, let me mention who this review is aimed at specifically.  It's mainly aimed at people like me, avid readers and  watchers of SF, Fantasy, Anime, and specifically cerebral anime.  (Cerebral  anime is anime which is often more of a social statement than a narrative,  ie. Serial Experiments - Lain.)  If you're used to cerebral anime, Blade  Runner is a walk in the park.  I really don't understand the complaints  about ambiguity -- I saw none in the Director's Cut.  I have never seen the  original, but I presume from all the comments that it is the typical  Hollywood-geared plot with a happy ending.
After watching the Director's  Cut, I don't think I want to see the original.  It would ruin the artistic  beauty and intellectual aspects of the movie that I enjoyed during my first  viewing.  Most cerebral anime has to be watched multiple times to gain an  understanding of the social and intellectual arguments.  Blade Runner is  clear-cut to those who are used to ambiguous plots and characters.  That  doesn't detract from its multiple viewing aspects, however...
As a movie,  Blade Runner is a masterpiece of dark SF.  I had always heard ""Blade  Runner inspired"" when I saw something Dark SF, but I had never  understood it until now.  The dark cityscape of future LA is enthralling to  me, and I just wish I could find more movies/anime that could create the  dark, sullen mood that Blade Runner created for me.
The movie still  contains some Hollywood-esque moments that do little to further the  artistic quality of the movie.  But they do not necessarily detract  either.
The visual effects of the movie are gorgeous for a film made in  1991.  The sound quality of the DVD was a little bland, but I presume it is  because of the sound technology at the time the movie was made.",960508800,3,1883,4.668711656441718
110331,3,0790729628,"The directors cut is head and shoulders above the original movie.  In the original, the narration eliminated any need to work out for yourself what the movie is about (which is most of the fun of watching a good movie), and  the ending was insipid and obviously did not fit.  It was clear to me when  I saw the movie for the first time that the ""happy"" ending had  been tacked onto the end with no thought given to consistancy.  I was not  surpised at all to find out that the ""executives"" had tacked it  on to try to make the film gross higher by appealing to the lowest common  denominator.  In the tug of war between art and profit, the original was  clearly compromised by the desire for profit.  Interestingly, this is  precisely what happened with the TV version of ""Brazil"", which  was pathetic (the director's cut of Brazil was brilliant).
The DVD leaves  a lot to be desired.  The audio is only sterio; there's no excuse for that.  There are virtually no extras included either.  No commentaries, no  deleted scenes, no ""making of"" featurette; just some production  notes.  Whoopie.
But I bought it because I love the movie.  If I had it  to do over again, I would have waited for a more full featured DVD.",960336000,10,1215,4.472477064220183

110335,4,0790729628,"Yup, I'm one of those dummies! I actually liked the original better. Personally, I feel the original focuses more on racial issues. Are we really capable of judging what is human and what is not? If a being comes  so close to the human original, do we have the right to retire  ""it"" if it's no longer convenient for us to have it around?  Reminds me a bit of the slave issue. The movie ""DARYL"" (remember  that one?) poses a similar question. And is most likely the reason Deckard  got so tired of his job the first time around, which leads to the logical  conclusion of the film's ending (I'm not giving this away although I can't  believe anybody hasn't seen this film yet).
Because of questions such as  this, ""Blade Runner"" has always been one of my favourite  Sci-Fi's. There's a lot of food for thought here, a great movie to discuss  with friends. The atmosphere which Ridley Scott creates with this  sinisterly dark film is absolutely fascinating. Would we want to live in a  world like that? I am glad for that bit of light at the end of the  original. Maybe WB will release it some day. In the mean time I give this  version four stars and am hoping for more.",959817600,5,1168,4.372093023255814
110336,4,0790729628,"I was a bit dissappointed in the DVD version, it was actually not much better than what I had on video, and there are not features to speak of.
The movie is a classic. I would put it up with the _Maltese Falcon_,  and _The Big Sleep_. In fact of all the Humphrey Bogart style movies that  Harrison Ford has tried out, this is the only one he does as well as Mr  Bogart might have done with similiar material.
The director's cut is  infinitely superior to the original movie. Gone are the cheesy voice overs  and instead you are left wondering if perhaps Dekkard himself is not what  he seems.
Had the DVD contained more features I would have instantly  given this a five, but the lack of effort in putting the DVD together drops  it down a notch.",959212800,4,746,4.2785714285714285
110337,5,0790729628,"I first saw this movie in its original Version in 1984.( I was a part of the Atari/Commodore 64 era then,) and I was very impressed by all the visuals I saw. Back then story didn't matter, but the special effects were  truly amazing. It holds up even better in its new format. The Narration and  ridiculous ""Happy"" ending were removed( I didn't think they  belonged either.), and the result is pure genius. The story takes time to  digest, but to me dosen't really matter as the pace works slow , but really  well edited and made. This film actually has 5 different Versions that were  created over a period of years, and if you want to know more, a great book  on the subject is: Future Noir: The making of Blade Runner by Paul M  Sammon.

110338,5,0790729628,"Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" is one of the most influential motion pictures of all time. Its highly stylized version of a 2019 Los Angeles, which is fantastically conceived and realized, became the source  of inspiration for countless other, mostly lesser, sci-fi movies.
What  makes ""Blade Runner"" so remarkable is that its spectacular  production design is not the only outstanding achievement. The film has an  exciting, multi-layered story and a terrific cast. Also worth noting is the  highly supportive music by the Greek composer Vangelis.
""Blade  Runner"" is one of those rare films that actually improve with each  viewing, because there is always something new to discover. The film shows  no sign of aging, which is also extremely unusual for a film with many  special-effects.

110339,4,0790729628,Out of an Impulse i rented this movie. Never having seen it before only hearing about it. Director Ridley Scott shows us a rainy metrop that is Los Angeles in the future. It stars Harrison Ford plays Decker who used to be a  blade runner now who is on the hunt for a replicant. Supposed to be a great  piece of sci-fi movie making that just about every sci-fi movie is based on  today. I guess im 18 years  to late to be blown away by the movie sure the  special effects and cinematography were excelllent but i guess i needed to  be in the 1980's to really be blown away by it.

When it comes to movies I am one of those people that generally likes everything for what it is, if nothing else. This would have to be the  exception to the rule. Boring, slow, cheesey effects, almost no plot, and  the ending was unfulfilling at best. I've only seen the directors cut so I  guess I can't appreciate the 'improvement', but whats so good about a  polished version of a fundementally bad movie?

110341,4,0790729628,"The one word that I very quickly associate with the directors cut of Blade Runner is, WOW!  After having seen the original movie, I thought it was so-so, and I was really annoyed at being told the story by Harrison Ford's  character, the choice to eliminate the voice-over was very  intelligent.
The movie follows a detective-type character (a blade  runner) in this case, as he chases down a gang of escaped killer  androids(or replicants).  However, during the process of tracking the  replicants, our blade runner begins to uncover a disturbing truth about  himself and those others around him.
The unicorn dream sequence that was  added definetly added to the overall effect of the movie, the effect was  absolutely jaw dropping.  Such a clear message presented in such an  abstract way.
The only thing that I would fault with this movie is the  quality of the sound editing, I found that sometimes the voices could have  used some jumping to contrast the sometimes very loud background  music.
Overall however, I would highly recommend this DVD to any avid  sci-fi DVD collector, and I think it did a respectable job basing itself  off of Phillip Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.",958521600,2,1195,4.895

I know it has something to do with the  question: Do the androids sleep with electric sheep? or something like  that, and the critics here say that maybe Deckard was a cyborg, but why?

110343,5,0790729628,May still be my favorite all-time movie - and I think the directors cut is just fine. My only problem is that i have seen Blade Runner over a hundred times at the very least with the Harrison Ford Voice-Over (since it was  first in the movie theatres way back in the dark ages) - so every time I  watch the movie - I still hear the faint echoes of Harrison Ford's voice in  my head while he's sitting under the overhang waiting for a place to sit at  the noodle stand. Of course it might not be Deckard's voice I'm hearing -  but that's besides the point. GREAT MOVIE!,957830400,,568,4.127272727272727
110344,1,0790729628,"It's really hard giving Blade Runner just one star. I know it deserves more...at least the movie I watched in the theater should. But this is what the Director's Cut deserves.
I remember seeing it when it first came out.  I really didn't like it at all. I ended up seeing it again several months  later when it was the bottom part of a double feature (they still had them  in those days!) because I went with a friend who hadn't seen it. This time  around, even though I knew what was going to happen, I found myself  reveling in the little nuances in the movie, the performances, the strange  quirks of this sci-fi/romance. It then became one of my favorite  movies.
When it came out in video, I got a copy. A few years later,  Ridley Scott came out with his ""director's cut."" When I saw it,  it seemed so much deader than the original release. I didn't like it and  never bought the video or the DVD.
One reviewer stated that Harrison  Ford, when called in to read the ""narrative"" did it very poorly  so the studio wouldn't use it. In my opinion, he was still trying to  develop his own style between Star Wars and Blade Runner. He had already  done two Star Wars and an Indiana Jones by this time, as well as Hanover  Street, Force 10 from Navaronne, Apocolypse Now and Frisco Kid. I haven't  seen the latter two but, other than the Indiana Jones movie, he seemed  really wooden and hadn't developed the ease in roles that began with Blade  Runner and became apparent with his next non-Lucas/Spielberg movie  ""Witness.""
I generally like buying ""director's cut""  movies. I especially like the ones that add more but retain the flavor of  the original release. But this DC  really presents you with a clearly  different and drearier movie. It feels like listening to a re-recorded hit  song; it may have one or two of the original singers but it's certainly not  the hit that I remember even though the artist may feel that it's truer to  what he originally had in mind!
It seems that the LE Collector's Edition  will also be the Director's Cut and I'm extremely disappointed. At the  least, they could have released both versions. If Scott is the reason that  the only version we have now is his DC, then he ought to be ashamed of  himself. It may not have been ""his movie"" that was released but  for many of us the original release WAS the movie. Would I have liked his  cut if that was the original release? It's hard to say but I really like  the melancholic edge of the original which was missing in the DC. I would  wager to say that it may NOT have taken on legendary status had the DC come  out instead.  I'm really disappointed that there is no version of the  original theatrical release out on DVD. I guess I'm destined never to own a  copy of one of my favorite movies...",957484800,16,2784,4.3968565815324165

110357,5,0790729628,"I really like the way this film blurs the distinction between human and machine, and seems to beg the question, ""So if a human is no different then a machine, then what makes a human human?"" The film subtly  responds, ""It is the complex interaction and relationship between  these machines that make them more"". You could probably pull the  thread of a number of underlying themes.
The Vangelis soundtrack is also  my all time favorite. The music swells and glistens and is rich with  texture and subtle sound effects. It actually adds to the environmental  atmosphere of the film and is very effective even without the visuals.
Personally I think the film is strong enough that both the original  release and the Director's Cut are just as good. I do like the slightly  darker feel and ending in the Director's Cut. I find the narrative a bit  unnecessary and distracting. However, as one other reviewer mentioned the  original release has more of a vintage 40's noir feel due to the narrative.  Either way this film is brilliant. Watch it a few times to fully appreciate  it.
It is too bad the DVD release doesn't take the opportunity to  include extras. To make up for it pick up a copy of the book ""Film  Noir: The Making of Blade Runner"" by Paul M. Sammon"".",957052800,,1262,4.6008968609865475

I was gripped by the movie as soon as it started and was completely satisfied at  the time it ended. This could be one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever  seen .
After seeing the movie, I have done some reading about it and i  gather that the director's cut has excluded the explanatory narrative and  the happy ending of the original and added the unicorn scene into it . Each  of these alterations seem to have been done for the good . I did not think  any explanation was required although the story is not immideately obvious  but then thats what intellegent viewing is all about . The director leaves  clues along the movie which the viewer needs to pick up .
The unicorn  scene is the highlight of the movie. Only for a few seconds, the scene  holds the key to the identity of the the hero.
I strongly recommend this  film to all lovers of the futuristic noir genre .",956534400,,1018,4.142857142857143

Yet I had no problem what so ever understanding  the movie minus the ""voice over narration."" The truth is after 5  minutes I found myself fully emersed in the futuristic inuendo, and  automatically linked with Deckard's character.
Now the Unicorn sequence  i did not understand untill the end when I realized, it was not symbolic so  don't waiste the energy trying to decode it. The truth is as long as you pay  attention to the oragami found at the end the Unicorn dream will all come  together and everything will make sense so you can get a better overall  picture of who Deckard is(replicant wise).
I was to young to see this  when it was originally released(actually I wasn't born yet)but I know I  would have gone to seen it and I would have loved it. Its almost impossible  to believe it was released in 1982, the special effects are supurb and I  must give it up for mr. Scott for the visuals. In conclussion this movie is  a briliant sci-fi master piece and a must-see, but thats just my  opinion.

110363,3,0790729628,"Blade Runner: The Director's Cut has it's share of problems. Scott took a scene from Legend of a unicorn and inserted it into a dream sequence for Dekkard. Nevermind the fact that the scene looks forced and doesn't really  fit into where he choose to put it, it does add a little to the film. I  like the 'happy ending' sequence removed. What I don't like is Ford's  missing narration. Big mistake. Scott claims that he didn;t originally want  it in there, than why do some scenes linger on for no reason.

But the real crime here is that for the DVD, they easi;y could have  added it as a seperate track and than given us the choice as to what we  want.
Blade Runner is a great movie, the original cut that is. If they  would combine the elemnts of the Director's Cut with the narration from the  original, it would be awesome.

Some of you raving about the missing voiceover ought to take a moment and think about what the movie - to a  first-time viewer - is without it: A boring dectective story with little or  no detail. The only explainer we get is at the beginning of the movie - one  whole paragraph. Otherwise, we're left to judge for ourselves what's  happening in 2019 LA. I don't mind complicated stories. Love them. But this  one was incomprehensible.
A unicorn? Sorry, if you're not a fan and no  one tells you that replicants dream that way, then you've got no idea what  it means. AND NO ONE TELLS YOU WHAT IT MEANS. NOT EVEN A HINT!
I do have  to give the nod for the ending. The redeption of the replicant in the final  conflict is touching. But I didn't know enough about him or Deckard to care  all that much.

Here is where the story gets it's meaning, what about the theese cybernatic creatures that were created to be our slaves ? We made them to do our dirty work, and to avoid their rebeliom we give them a short lifespan. We play god and toy with their lifes, we love them, we kill them.

110366,5,0790729628,"Back in 1982 I was fortunate enough to have actually seen Blade Runner in the theater. It made quite an impression on me, In 1992 I was able to see The Director's Cut in a theater as well. Either way, for me it's one of the  best films of all time. The difference in the two versions is quite  significant.  I happen to really enjoy and appreciate both versions, In a  sense it's two very different films. Harrison Ford's weary narration does  give it a 40's noir edge to it, without it, it becomes an even more distant  and very open-ended film, making Rick Deckard that much more of a  mysterious character. Is he or isn't he?
Harrison Ford's haunting  performance as the weary cop, is among his best. Rutger Hauer is  spellbinding as the replicant who just maybe more human than his creators.  Sean Young is memorable as Rachel, the confused and conflicted replicant.  Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson and Edward James Olmos are the other  standout actors. Director Ridley Scott created a visual masterpiece, on  every viewing you always wind up catching something new to it. The  groundbreaking production design and visual effects become much imitated in  following years. The haunting and eerily atmospheric score by Vangelis  captures the perfect mood.  The story itself is filled with subtle and not  so subtle themes and imagery and very much open to discussions.
This  particular DVD edition is ok, being that it was among the earliest DVD  releases. Warner Bros is in fact releasing a Special Edition later this  year that is to contain more features and remastered sound. For those who  have been intrigued by this unique Sci-fi tale, there is a must read book  for you..Future Noir The Making Of Blade Runner, which is a fascinating and  in-depth look at the making of this classic film.",953942400,9,1799,4.785016286644951

110379,4,0790729628,"First the bad news. This is quite a lame transfer. Perhaps I got spoiled by the free copy of Bug's Life that came with my iMac DV SE. But man would I like Scorsese and his team of movie refurbishers to have a go at this  one. There is just way too much grain on the DVD transfer; like using 1000  ASP film and no flash to shoot the first dance at a wedding. No bells and  whistles either with the DC. I new I was in for it when I saw the dreadful  artwork on the cover. You gotta love Helvetica; such an expressive  font.
The good news? Without the drab, spoon-feeding narration to fill up  those mean and nasty moments of silence (sheesh!) there is a newfound  tension between Rachel and Deckard. Without the narration, we are brought a  whole level closer to the story, and have to fend for ourselves during  moments of anti-voiceover. Whereas with the narration, we were simply  passers-by.
This film is all mood. Slow yourself down. Pick a late  evening. No one else in the room. No popcorn. And slip into the film's  pace. You'll have a far richer experience with the DC, simply because  you'll notice more.",953424000,13,1112,4.365853658536586
110380,3,0790729628,"Having never seen Blade Runner, and after hearing so many good things about it, I just had to see what the fuss was about. So, credit card in hand, I bought the Director's Cut DVD. I slipped it into my DVD player with  a little tingle going up and down my spine. Then I watched it, all the way  through, twice.
 Well, was it what i expected? Yes and no. It looked  amazing, with effects that couldn't be topped today. The look of Los  Angeles was stunning and gothic and oh so pretty. The symbolic nature of  many of the shots added to the atmosphere. The music was effective in its  oppressiveness and spare style. The acting was incrediable. But . . . . . .  . .
 As I said above, it was kinda pointless. I never really  connected to Deckard's character. I felt for him, but never really got  involved. The plot meanered, sometimes confusingly, from here to there, and  while it needed to do that to bring some plotpoints home, there really  wasn't any energy for the most part in it (with the exception of the times  when the replicants were killed, and the battle at the end). And, my God,  was it depressing; dark, rainy, showing the decay of society from the  opening frame to the closing shot of the elevator doors.
 It wasn't a  bad movie; it looked and sounded as good or better than the movies today.  But . . . kinda pointless. I know it had a message to tell about what it  means to be human, and it told that message.
Anyway, 3 stars. Should be  watched at least once, but as to whether you like it, I guess that varies  from person to person.",953337600,2,1556,4.238907849829351
110381,4,0790729628,"I've viewed both origional and DC versions, and I'm sorry, but the DC is much better.  If I want sci-fi that's easy to understand and has a happy ending, I'll watch Star Wars.
The narration in the origional actually  doesn't bother me that much.  It was largely useless, either irrelevant or  not hard to figure out.  It's neat background that the guy was speaking a  local dialect that was a combination of other languages, but it didn't help  the story at all.  And it's not hard to figure out that Decker is a Blade  Runner, or what Blade Runners do.  While not horrid, I prefer the movie  without the narration so I can focus on the movie, and also to get rid of  that nagging feeling that my intelligence is being insulted.
What is  horrid in the origional is the ending.  For one, it's happy, and Blade  Runner is not a happy movie.  BR is a tragedy, and trying to force it into  being otherwise doesn't work.  Second, the ending came out of nowhere.  It  was obvious that it was just tacked on.  Also, it did a nice job of  ignoring the central question of the film (plotwise) -- whether Decker is  human or not.
In the DC, there are some more scenes with character  development that help bring the afforementioned question into better focus.  Especially the important unicorn scene.  The unicorn scene is important!  At the end of the film, there is a reference to the unicorn scene -- a  reference made by someone who should not have known about it.  That's what  makes it important, and why it further calls into question Decker's  humanity.  Talk about not making sense -- in the origional, the reference  to the unicorn scene is made, but with no unicorn scene.  That makes no  sense.
Now despite prefering the DC much more, I will say that I'm  dissapointed that both versions don't appear on the DVD.  I may not like  it, but it would be usefull for comparison and for those (obviously  plentiful) people who miss having Harrison Ford explain everything to them.  What else are DVD's for?

However many told me that they rented the movie (director's cut) but couldn't follow it.  Much to my chagrin I  found out why.  The original cut had Ford providing a voice-over that  explained some of culture, environment and  gave insight as to why he  (Decker) quit the force.  So much was lost by removing he voice-over. In  the  director's cut, you're left with the scene of Ford flying off with  Young to live out what remains of  her 4-year lifespan.  The original has  the same scene but the voice-over explains how they beat the system ( and  Olmos ).  Hands down the original  cut with Ford's voice-over would easily  earn at least 5 stars, yet this director's cut was too deep, especially in  the scene where Ford confronts Hauer.

The unicorn vision was kind of  creative because we all have our little random thoughts that come from the  back of our mind, but it was a little corny.

It is missingHarrison Ford's narration which, quite frankly, stated the obvious,and it removes the corny happy ending that distorts the overall tone of the film, which was supposed to be dark and dismal.  It might also help you to know that a shot of Deckard dreaming of a unicorn was also included in the director's cut, hinting Deckard's existence as a replicant at the conclusion of the film.  People say that editors have power over all, but ""Blade Runner: The Director's Cut"" is Ridley Scott's version.  I'll have you know that Ridley Scott strongly objected to the version of ""Blade Runner"" released in 1982. The narration and ending was added in by Warner Bros. executives, hoping to get a better reception from audiences.  Both the narration and the ending ruined the film's artistic qualities, and it ruined ""Blade Runner"" by preventing it from being the film it was supposed to be, which is a thinking man's sci-fi film.  Better still, it is missing the bits of violence included on the original videotape release(a shot of Roy Batty pushing Tyrell's eyes back into his head), which I felt, ruined the overall enjoyment of the film.  I was annoyed at the lack of extras on this DVD, as well as the sound, which is a standard Dolby Surround track.  But the picture quality makes up for everything.  Thanks to anamorphic enhancement, which allows an incredible amount of detail into the picture, ""Blade Runner"" now looks better than ever!  I'm suprised people were dissapointed in it.  I would give this DVD 5 stars, had they included extras of any kind.  That annoyed me, yes, but the picture quality is stunning.  I heard that they are preparing a special edition of ""Blade Runner"" for DVD.  That would be great, although I am quite content with the existing version.

The two sides would have been better utilized with one side as a  widescreen version of the director's cut and the other side as a widescreen  version of the original cut with Decker's voiceover narrative. That would  have allowed us BLADE RUNNER enthusiasts to compare the two versions and  fan the argument on which is the better version.
I also agree with the  reviewer that would've liked more of the extras that a lot of the better  DVDs have nowadays. I have no idea what the Special Edition will be like. I  just wish I knew about it before I got this one.
As for whether the film  itself is worth owning, of course it is. BLADE RUNNER is now a classic.  There's a reason why it's still a bestseller 18 years after its initial  release in the theaters.

Even the scene selections are inept.  Perhaps my DVD is  different, but the scene selections go in the order of 3, 7, 12, etc.  Not  only was this DVD put together by hacks, the hacks can&iexcl;t count.  There&iexcl;s  not even a still image from the movie on the DVD&iexcl;s main menu.  Just a  generic Warner Bros logo.  The picture and sound aren&iexcl;t up to DVD  standards either.  The picture isn&iexcl;t sharp and the sound Cwith the  exception of the music and some special effects sounds- is often flat and  has a &iexcl;1970&iexcl;s&iexcl; toneless quality to it.  It&iexcl;s almost as if it was  transferred to DVD from videotape instead of the original negative.
The  &iexcl;Director&iexcl;s Cut&iexcl; is a confusing mess too.  As far as I can tell, the  only differences are the omission of Harrison&iexcl;s voice over, the &iexcl;flying  to safety&iexcl; footage during the end credits and a baffling inter-cut scene  of a unicorn running through a forest from the movie &iexcl;Legend&iexcl; while  Harrison is idly playing a piano.  Will someone tell me what a unicorn from  a bad Tom Cruise movie has to do with airing out replicants in L.A. 2019?  I miss the voiceover too.  As I understand, it was originally put in  because while testing the film, the audience couldn&iexcl;t follow the plot.  With it missing, the scenes where it used to be are awkward because the  characters are waiting for the nonexistent voiceover to end.  And speaking  of voiceovers, a Director&iexcl;s Commentary would&iexcl;ve been fascinating; but  apparently WB shoved this DVD out before one could be made or Ridley Scott  had better things to do.
On the plus side, Vangelis&iexcl; rich score shines  and is perfect for this leisurely paced movie.  I have it on CD and  strongly recommend it.

The titles and  text were poor; losing their crisp edges, showing that not taking care of  color balance and using good analog-to-digital mastering can really ruin a  good viewing experience. Then to top it off, the exquisite Vagellis  soundtrack wasn't reproduced in the Dolby Digital surround sound I was  expecting from DVD. My SVHS played the soundtrack better than the DVD! A  real disappointment. Of course, some may say I am being picky, but with the  tempo of the film -- seeing the room shake like the camera needed to be put  on a steady cam is not acceptable, period! For reference, the playback was  reproduced on Sony's reference model DVD-7700 using component video on both  a Mitsubishi HDTV and a Sony VEGA-36XBR flat screen TV. The sound was  passed digitally to a BOSE 5.1 home theatre balanced for the room.",947462400,31,1332,4.857777777777778

110427,4,0790729628,"My advice to anyone wanting to experience this film is to watch both versions.  The origional gives more of the noir experience, (despite what some say about the voice over it does lend to understanding parts of the  story for the uninitiated) and is a classic in it's own right.  Scott's cut  on the other hand offers a more plausible and suitable ending to the film,  and adds enough extra to more strongly hint at the possibility of Deckard  being a replicant.  The director's cut also has a bit more  ""depth"" to it than the origional... you do need to think more to  get it, but that's the main reason I suggest you see both versions.  The  unicorn dream sequence was an excellent edition in my opinion.  I  honestly wish WB would release the origional widescreen and the director's  cut on a single disc so people could experience both.  I loved the  director's cut, the only glaring omission from the DVD is Dolby Digital 5.1  sound.  This movie was MADE to be remasterd in DD.  I'm quite disappointed  at the stereo only (not even prologic I think) soundtrack.  This is the  only thing that keeps me (and I should hope others) from giving the DVD a 5  star rating.",946684800,68,1171,4.497607655502392
110428,2,0790729628,"This is a five star movie--a classic, featured prominently in every film class I've ever taken--and my review score is downgraded only at the quality of the DVD, which is possibly the worst I've ever seen. Picture  quality is just fine, but sound, which is advertised on the box as Dolby  Digital, is not. You'll only get at most Pro Logic Surround with the right  equipment off this disc, as it hasn't been newly remastered for this  release and Dolby Digital didn't exist when it was made.
There aren't any  new goodies on this DVD, and the generic interface/menu screens absolutely  suck.
You can argue that this is no big deal, but when you see the loving  care that's been put into the extras and menus of DVD's like Alien and  Aliens, and see how much it adds, you can compare and see what a terrible  disservice has been done to this classic film. It doesn't even come in a  durable box (not many do, but the ones that do are appreciated).
Unfortunately, it's the only game in town if you want to own this  landmark work. It's too bad that the studio won't remaster the sound and  rerelease this DVD as it should be, with both Director's Cut and Theatrical  Release on the same disc, complete with proper menus and extras.

It had such a profound effect on me, I mean OK I didn't fully  understand the narrative, I hadn't the fogyest why Han Solo was now a cop  chasing a naked man who stuck nails in his hand, but visually it was  absorbing! The Directors cut is by far the best way to see the film, mostly  because it gives youthe choice as a viewer to enjoy the film without  hearing an arsey Harrison Ford doing a lame voiceover. It also brings in  key storyline features, that I don't want to give away. The film still  looks gorgeous, the special effects stand the test of time. It is one of  the type of films that you can watch over and over again, and find  something new each time. I like that fact..... oh and that you get daryl  Hannah in a lycra suit..always a bonus.

The original  soundtrack was never released and Vangelis' recent soundtrack release was  coifed to his preferences. Get the egos out of the way! Fans have always  wanted the original flick and the original soundtrack...and have been left  waving our dollars in the air for the taking. I was stunned the DVD version  did not allow for the original cut.

110445,5,0790729628,"If you like the original Blade Runner better than the Director's cut, please read ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" by Philip K. Dick. This is the story BR is based upon. The difference is like reading  Stephen King's ""The Stand"" in the 600-page version, then the  recently released 1100-page version. Very important things are lost when it  is cut.
BR-DC is true to the original story, where the original release  seemed more an attempt to emulate James Ellroy. The elimination of the  voiceover was a huge step to getting out of the '40's film noir style, and  the ending, like the ending of the book (and the PC game) left just enough  doubt to Deckard's humanity to give the viewer something to think  about.
The unicorn scene, while not in the original story, gave something  back to it. Dick's book had a sub-storyline about Deckard's wife (really?)  and attaining a real animal. The unicorn scene accomplished this same  effect while still being viewable in a reasonable amount of time. Without  this scene, the DC ending would fall flat.
Speaking of the DC ending, it  is much closer to the story's original ending than the ""happy  ending"" WB forced on the theatrical release. It's also a lot more  real. How often have you had a happy ending? Remember, it has to be happy,  and it has to be an ending.
Blade Runner: the Director's Cut should be in  every true sci-fi fan's collection just for sticking (mostly) to the  original story.

I bought an imitation sound track, (well done), at first, because  the real thing was not available.  Later on, when Vangelis released his  version, with great satisfaction, I purchased that on CD.  In my opinion,  this is, by far, the best movie and sound track for enjoying a well put  together entertainment system.  The movie is an intense, involving science  fiction film noir romantic detective story.  There are quite a few  ""cult classics"".  This is one.

This is more than simply a movie, just made for the heck of it, it  is a world unto itself, along the lines of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.  It is vastly different from those two, but deserves a place along side  them. The stunning cinementography and the lush characters keep one  entertained and thinking for hours after a viewing. Of course it has  wonderful special effects, but unlike most modern movies does not allow the  effects to take over and obscure the story and the characters. The ending,  while much less happy than that of the original, is powerful and contains  striking imagery remenicent in some ways of The Third Man. This is truly  one of the great movies, and will go down as such. If you have not seen it  or do not own it, do both soon, it is well worth it.

The plot and details don't fall into  exaggeration or caricature, something way too common this days, and if I  can think of a movie that portrays a credible vision of the near future  (Los Angeles, 2019), this is it. The casting is great, my favourite always  being Rachel (Sean Young). Why this actress didn't reach higher in her  career is still a mistery.

The pace is glacial and the lack of dialog and explanation make the plot confusing and tedious.  The narration in the original is  cheesy and overplayed but lends some humanity to an otherwise drab role and  keeps the movie on track.  With regard to the 'central theme' mentioned in  previous reviews, anyone who has been paying attention in the original will  get it (give us ignorant masses some credit), and if anything the narration  and imagery at the time of Roy's death underscores it.  As for the ending,  I prefer the original though I agree it was a little heavy-handed.  The  sunlight creates a stark contrast to the darkness that saturates the  remainder of the film...I guess it boils down to whether you're the type of  person who likes a happy ending or a melancholy one.  The Director's cut is  worth a watch if you're a Blade Runner fan but I strongly recommend the  original, at least for starters.

110453,4,0790729628,"'Blade Runner' is really a phenomenon in the sense that never before has a would-be screen Leviathan bombed so badly, so quickly upon release. There's so much awe with which to hold this movie that that awe has itself become  sickeningly cliched over the years, as if the ranks of 'B.R.' admirers have  swelled beyond the intelligentsia clique that was there in the beginning.  But, to be fair, the mystique that has formed such a powerful undercurrent  over the years does indeed exist. Firstly, the casting is as flawless as  the academic merits of the story. Director Scott, still fresh from his  'Alien' phase, handled himself well in the driving seat, pulling class A+  results from a heavily invested-in set. The violence is sufficient for the  film and the pacing worked just fine.  So what went wrong after all  that? The answer could well lie in the novel feel behind 'Blade Runner'.  It's not sci-fi per se but, rather, is a shaky hybrid of Forties Film Noir  and a new type of Science Fiction which had really only been seen before in  the likes of 'Outland'. 1981 and 82 audiences weren't ready to receive this  marriage of styles - the counterfeit glory of the 'Star Wars' saga had  poisoned far, far too many minds for a break with formulaic convention to  be welcomed. Also, the picture was derived from the short story 'Do  Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?' which proved that it had an immediate  grounding in a thinking man's world. Unfortunately, Thinking men's films do  not sell well when put alongside Hollywood sugar-coats. The masses are just  too vain, surface-oriented and gluttonous to want to strain their brains  too far and there were far too many cerebral elements in 'Blade Runner' to  pass this acid test. The heavy leanings toward symbolism are alone proof of  this (your average everday moron just can't accommodate stuff like this in  his own mind). It goes to show that a good idea and a good film  transcription of that are far from being enough to make the end result sell  well. What makes 'Blade Runner' a classic is simply that it has been a  solid catalogue seller on video over the years. Thanks in particular to the  1992 tenth anniversary re-release, Ridley Scott's gem seems to have been  well and truly granted a posthumous type of respect, almost born of guilt  from those who had lacked the mental stamina to take it in '82.  Last  point: Vangelis's soundtrack (the 1994 CD release) is otherworldly to hear.  It is but one more piece of evidence to demonstrate that the film was an  expensive gamble that failed initially (through no fault of its own) but  then bounced back because its redeeming features were too numerous and  fundamental to let it be defeated. This is an anti space soap-opera and  therefore the perfect antidote to all this neo 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek'  hype. It is also Ridley Scott at his peak. 'Blade Runner' stands to this  day in a category all of its own - a one-off curiosity - the oddity  blockbuster with a small 'b' which is loved by many, more because many of  them think it's cool to love an underdog rather than because the vast  majority want to discuss the work's actual content.

Imagine reading a novel: Heart of  Darkness for instance.  Was Conrad's purpose in writing this book simply to  tell a story?  If you believe so, then don't bother with this film.

As a result, the film still has a blotchy  analog look. Also, while the Director's cut presents more relentlessly the  harsh vision of the post-apocalyptic future, it is definitely less  accessible. Moreover, there are clearly some places where dubbed dialog was  added in, or dialog was cut in the remake, so it's not as polished.

Ford's voice over in  the original was directly contradictory to the ""who's the hero?""  theme of the movie (by the way, it ain't Ford).  The cheesy ending in the  original also buried this theme.
Some have argued that the removal of  Ford's voice over makes the film hard to follow, but the voice over makes  the film *impossible* to follow on the thematic level by burying the main  theme and making Ford look like your typical action movie hero.  So however  ""hard to follow"" the Director's Cut is, it's vastly preferable to  the incongruent original version.

The  film is shot almost entirely at night, and everything looks as gothic as  you can get in a 21st century setting. This is all arresting at first, but  as the movie settles down for it's overlong, confusing, feckless, and  totally BORING story, not even the visuals are able to save it. I had read  once that Ridley Scott had originally planned to direct TOTAL RECALL,  another short story by Philip K. Dick, when the screenplay was still in the  works.

Naturally, that tape was the original version with the voiceover and happy  ending and without the unicorn sequence.  Somehow that copy disappeared and  I replaced it with the Directors Cut. I thought of the original as a  five-star movie and I have to remove one for this version.  I think the  voiceover is a neutral factor, the uncertainty of the revised ending is  slightly superior, but the unicorn sequence is a jarring disturbance.  I  had heard and read about the dream sequence for years before I saw it and I  have to admit that if I had not been told that it was supposed to raise the  question of Decker's  humanity, it would have totally perplexed me.  I am a  reasonably intelligent person with a college degree and I just do not see  how a fleeting glimpse of a unicorn suggests that Decker is a Replicant.  Left on my own, I would have interpreted it to mean he wanted out of his  ""real"" world and wondered why he had not gone offworld.  Not only  does the unicorn sequence seem out of place and unclear, it was  unnecessary.  All these years later, I can still remember debating the  possiblity that Decker was not human with friends on the trip home from the  theater  based only on what we saw in the original version.  Ridley Scott  should have quit tinkering while he was ahead.

110560,4,0790729628,"Everyone who misses the voice-over narration, listen up. Number one, Harrison Ford sounded bored, stiff, and uninterested in what he was describing, which is pretty curious, all things considered. Number two, it  was redundant, and reminded me of what happens in comic books, when the  superhero has a thought balloon that describes what he's doing as he's  doing it (""And now I'll use my x-ray vision to reveal the location of  Lex Luthor's hidden base."") Nobody thinks (or talks) that way. The  idea that Deckard might be a replicant is, I think, hinted at strongly in  this one, more strongly than in the original. Why would Edward James Olmos'  character leave a unicorn origami except if he knew that Deckard had memory  implants that would produce a unicorn dream? He wanted to let Deckard know  what he is. How does Batty know Deckard's name? And why, near the very  beginning, does Deckard insist on ordering the usual at the sushi bar (or  whatever) and the guy is like, ""Who are you? What usual?"" My  theory is that Deckard is that replicant who got ""caught in an  electrified field"" at the Tyrell corporation. They took him,  ""reprogrammed"" him (or whatever) and turned him loose. That's why  his boss is so... creepy. ""I need you, Deckard. I need the old Blade  Runner magic."" Does that ring true in any way? The only problem, as I  see it, with the idea that he's a replicant is why is he so physically  inferior? He can't jump far, or run very fast, he's not particularly  strong, and Pris (a ""pleasure model"") beats the stuffing out of  him. I can't really reconcile that.",928972800,,1587,4.6606498194945845

The story involves a certain Rick Deckard, played innocently by  Harrison Ford who manages to fit in perfectly in tune with the Noirish  theme of the movie.
He has been assigned to ""retire"" dangerous  Nexus 6 replicants, Off-world colonists who are seeking to increase their 4  year life span. Rutger Hauer is magnificent as Roy Batty, leader of this  group.
There is also Daryl Hannah, who portrays Pris. Quite what made  Ridley Scott decide to choose her must have been a mystery to WB, but she  remains the gem in this movie, neither outdoing nor detracting from the  main characters.
Blade Runner remains my favourite movie of all time,  however, I am a stalwart and the original still seems slightly better...  Nevertheless, I feel that once you have seen the movie, you will want both  versions.

I think this movie is based on a novel  by Stanley Kubrick (I think??? Correct me if wrong!) called 'Do androids  dream electric dreams' (another book I've never got round to reading).
In  terms of casting, this film about did it perfect. Harrison Ford was,  naturally, the choice for the cop, with Rutger Hauer providing the  performance of his life. Each of the other androids are played beautifully,  especially Darryl Hannah's unusually cast role as a sex droid, capable of  breaking a mans head between her thighs.
The music is almost definately a  classic - it drifts along catching the ear, slightly permeating the feel of  the city, it's rough streets awash with grime.
There are several classic  scenes in this movie; the snake womans (painful) demise (who'd of thought  death could appear so disgusting and beautiful, yet its a robot...), 'Time  to Die', the final moments for Ford and his new lover.

110576,5,0790729628,"I've always been taken with this film visually, but on this last viewing...  Well, IMHO this is a true work of art.  First, remember this was only 3-4 years after the first Star Wars breathed life back into the  genre.  Blade Runner is light years (ahem) ahead in terms of visuals,  acting, camera work - the basic criteria for film evaluation.  Then, due to  the conceptually pregnant ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep""  it is also a film about Ideas.  Ridley Scott (who came out of British  Television commercial work) is the master of mood, and this film proves it,  suprisingly with pacing as good as the best of Wenders or Ozu.  All this  adds up to what Schrader would call a trancendent expression - a film that  trancends its normative bounds (and, honestly the ""happy"" ending  would be a classic Schrader break in visual style.  Typically, Film is  considered more emotional, more visceral, able to tap into our gut directly  through the eyes (I only do eyes, you nexus 6? I make you eyes).  By  holding the camera, moving the light, pausing between lines, focusing on  reaction rather than action (Decker after Rachels 100th question,  St. Sebastian after Roy steps in, Pris' growling no), Scott gives us a  meditation on existance, (More Human than Human is our motto) and a  cautionary look at the future.

From Harrison  Ford's 2body language"" character through to probably Rutger Hauer's  most stunning performance this film outclasses and outstrips anything  before it. It has yet to be equaled in intelligence and its ability to be  thought provoking.
The film portrays both the decaying Earth and the  decay of its inhabitants. The irony of ""machines"" seeking  humanity while humans lose their humanity is only one of the many subtle  ideas throughout the film.
My only complaint is the number of people who  talk about the ending but miss the point. This is one to sit in a bar and  discuss for hours on end. So take my advice and think your way through this  film.

The opportunity to create the original vision Ridley Scott had when he read Hampton Fancher's original script has been whittled away by time. So, this is as close as we  can get. There are aspects to both versions of Blade Runner that would make  for the ""perfect "" director's cut of the film. Although the  narration was delivered in a stilted drone by Ford, it did add to the noir  quality of the film. Without it, Blade Runner isn't quite the same film.  Still, this version(which isn't truly the ""director's cut""--that  version is lost, or locked up in a warehouse on the Warners lot. See The  Making of Blade Runner for more details) is superior in many respects to  the theatrical version.  The narrative, always eliptical at best, is both  strengthened and made more ambigious with the inclusion of the fabled  unicorn scene(by the way, the shot of the unicorn is from Scott's Legend,  which is why the footage is so much grainer. The outtake was added to the  film because the original unicorn footage was lost after the first preview  when Scott had to recut the film). Is Deckkard a replicant? Scott thinks  so, but others closely associated with the making of the film aren't so  sure. This mystery gives the film a quality like that found in the best  literature; multiple and complex ways to reintrepet a film. This, in many  respects, is Scott's most complex film. Harrison Ford still hates it to  this date which is ironic considering Ford gives one of his best  ""unaffected"" performances.

Personally, I prefer the  Director's Cut because we know that the motivation for the changes came  from the commercial process, not the artistic one, but I certainly  understand that the voiceovers make this film much more accessible.  The  details and the density of the material make Blade Runner (in any version)  a fascinating film; one can watch it a dozen times and continue to find new  things.  This is truly a movie-lover's movie and, in any incarnation, the  film itself deserves FIVE STARS.
On the other hand, the DVD was mastered  poorly in both respects, video and audio.  Put simply, the video transfer  looks ""dull"", the colours seem washed out and the colour  separation and contrast are sub-optimal.  There is some artifacting, which  is particularly noticeable during the scenes which are filmed inside the  Bradbury Bldg. where the sets are very dark (well okay, the whole movie is  very dark!).  Comparatively, the audio is even worse.  The dynamic range is  strangely exaggerated whilst the EQ is poor and it seems that whoever  mastered it to surround didn't have the time and/or attention to really  pull out the little aural details that can make a Dolby Digital mix truly  shine; one would think that the spectacular sounds and music in Blade  Runner would have deserved a careful and thorough cleanup and remaster to a  5.1/7.1 mix.  Also, the reference level seems quite low.
I'm not trying  to sound too analytical; I just wish that the folks who mastered 'Fifth  Element' (my FIVE STARS on pure audio/video quality) could have worked  their magic on Blade Runner.  In any case, this film is one of my absolute  favourites.",912729600,9,1925,4.842592592592593
110634,5,0790729628,"Far beyond what so many sci-fi films have tried or will try to be.  Visionary filmmaking by Ridley Scott that will never look outdated.  The story, although a little hard to follow in some parts, makes you care about  the characters - even the artificial humans.  Other than Raiders of the  Lost Ark, Harrison Ford's role as a futuristic detective is his best.  Watch it, rewind it, and watch it again.  Scott took his time on this one  and it shows.",912556800,,450,4.469135802469136

110636,5,0790729628,"This movie is my all-time favorite and I think the ending in director's cut version is much more interesting and thought provoking. The visuals are superb, this movie was made before computer era and special effects in it  rival the most expensive, computer-generated effects in today's movies. It  has an atmosphere that many tried to copy but very few succeeded. I've seen  it many times and each time I see it I discover new things. During my last  viewing I started contemplating it's religious points. It is a tragic story  of androids created by humans with a limited life span and made for human  (God?) purpose. Yes, they are violent, but that's how they were created.  They are not to blame; it's their creators who should be. If you just  watched this movie once you have to see it again. You'll discover many  hidden aspects that are not apparent during first viewing. It is a classic.",911606400,,896,4.6923076923076925
110647,5,0790729628,"I have mixed feelings about the narration. It adds to the movie in some places and detracts in others. The ""little people"" comment by Walsh was much more sinister without the dissertation/interpretation of the  narrator. Still, it sorta feels right to have it there, to complete the  noirish aspects of it. Maybe it's better this way, to have the movie sans  narration before us, hanging together better cinematically, while still  having the narration playing silently in our memories.",911347200,,486,5.1923076923076925
110648,5,0790729628,Blade Runner is the screen adaptation of Philip K. Dick 'Do Androids Dream  of Electric Sheep' and although it differs slightly it remains true to his  harrowing vision of our bleak future. It tackles some difficult moral and  ethical questions that we will be forced to deal with soon. Nothing is for  certain.  END,907545600,,316,4.777777777777778
110649,4,0790729628,"Bladerunner, a highwater mark in science fiction film making, is updated by the director in this Director's Cut version with the elimination of the narration, the inclusion of the unicorn scene and deletion of the final scenes of the original version's ending.  Brilliant as well as controversial from its opening premiere, ""Blade Runner"" by director Ridley Scott who had only just come off of directing ""Alien"" folded the science fiction elements into a 50's detective film noir.  A minority of critics and audience members truly believed in the shadowy elements of darkness and the emphasis on detective work.  With the elimination of the narration (even though Harrison Ford apparently hated it himself and attempted to produce an awful narration), for me and a few others, the narration is a key component of what made this movie so unique in its combination of film elements.  Thus while this movie has become a cult classic, the Director's Cut without the na! rration apparently for a few of us diminishes somewhat what is truly one of the best science fiction movies made.  Also, the upbeat ending of the original American version, shouldn't be panned as overly mainstream or completely optimistic.  It's reference to the vague length of life of a replicant keeps the storyline intriguing because it only adds to the uncertainty of one's relationship with one another and uncertainty about the future.  However, all this is much better described in Paul M. Sammon's excellent reference guide entitled, ""Future Noir The Making of Blade Runner"" (1996).  END",901670400,4,1562,5.122047244094488
110650,5,0790729628,"I was a ten year old boy when Blade Runner was released to the world.  When I was old enough to watch it, I loved how the story progressed. The idea of androids wanting to live beyond their 4 year lifespan was really revolutionary. I bought the Director's Cut on letterboxed video sometime after 1993 and it made more sense than the original film.  Because of the unicorn scene, Harrison Ford's character could be an Android and doesn't know it.  I shall wonder about Rachel and Deckard after this story.  I hope they continue to dream of electric sheep.  END",900460800,,559,4.55

I kept thinking this is going to get really exciting any minute now, but after an hour into it I realized I needed 3 espressos if I was going to stay awake.  DVD is an excellent medium for this film.  It really shows the detail that Ridley Scott put into it.  It is an excellent film for your DVD collection, if you're wanting to show off your machine.  Otherwise, this movie is a real snooze.  END",898646400,2,564,4.365384615384615
110652,5,0790729628,"BRDC is, in my opinion, one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. But what troubles me is that this movie could have been more if its makers were given a few million dollars more. Even though there are a very noticable amount of errors (script inconsistancies, dubbing, visual problems), this movie still shines from a VERY solid performance by Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, who plays Roy Batty, the lead of his replicant clan. Another solid performance is given by Joe Turkle, who plays God with his character, Eldon Tyrell.  If you live for visuals in movies, this movie will have you spellbounded. From the opening scene, you are treated to 2 hours of pure bliss. CG scenes and miniatures are eye candy, and enhances the movie's feel.  Ridley Scott's futuristic epic is a must for anyone who even remotly enjoys a good sci-fi flick. I think the film should be redone, and retrofitted with better F/X, have the scenes and characters who were deleted due to budget cuts, and have the parallel story that is in WESTWOOD STUDIOS' adaption of the movie. Both are astounding and will forever hold a place on my shelf, and in my heart.  END",897868800,,1134,4.66
