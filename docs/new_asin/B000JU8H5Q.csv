8321649,5,B000JU8H5Q,"The only reason I purchased this movie is because I enjoyed the first two installments in the Gun Crazy film series and Hara Fumina is in it. From Sailor Moon to Gun Crazy, who would've thought it? I was impressed with the acting of many more cast members than Fumina though. This movie isn't revolutionary by any means, it's not bringing anything spectacular to the big screen but it is still an incredibly entertaining film. The action scenes are good and it manages to get a good plot going as well. I still watch it now and then. 5 stars!",1393200000,,542,4.43
