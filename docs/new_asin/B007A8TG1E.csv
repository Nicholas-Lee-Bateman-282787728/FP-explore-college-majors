8513178,4,B007A8TG1E,"I'd seen some Longmen-style taiji on Youtube, and am interested in taiyi xiao yao zhang, but I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this. It is a very long 26 minute routine, but with only about 6 or 7 unique movements. It is performed very slowly around a circle approx 5-6ft in diameter. One performs a movement, takes a step (also slowly), performs the movement again, and so on, changing movements with each completion of the circle. Each walk around the circle can take 3-4 minutes. Think of something like a walking qi gong. The movements are upright, and involve stretching arms overhead, front/back, and so on, all very gentle, slow and doable for most folks with a typical range of motion. Those with shoulder problems might find it too much (or perhaps just what they need to for a therapy).

The production is good quality for these kinds of videos, it is recorded outdoors in good lighting. A full demonstration is followed by a breakdown by movement, followed by yet another full demonstration. Total length: 1hr 25min. Be advised: as the product description says ""DVD Language Speaking: Chinese Subtitle: Chinese"" this is all in CHINESE. So, if (like me) you do not speak or read Chinese, then you'd plan on learning by observation only, which with this few number of movement should be fairly simple.

Not quite something I was interested in, but some day maybe down the road I'll come back to it.",1496016000,,1424,4.737903225806452
