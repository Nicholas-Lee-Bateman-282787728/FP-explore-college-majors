8304562,4,B001G9CNIG,"Sangre de Mi Sangre follows a young man in search of his father. Pedro leaves Mexico and is soon robbed by Juan, a streetwise kid his own age, who goes on to retain his idendity. Juan finds Pedro's father first and works a long game of scheming against the father, who is wary, weary, and wise, for the most part. In the mean time, Pedro encounters Magda, a prostitute and hustler as well. The young men are on a parallel course to the same destination, but one gets their first, leaving the viewer with an ending that is unsatisfying but understandable. The acting and direction here is very good, especially Paola Mendoza who plays Magda. She lends a humanity to the role not often seen in that type of character. At any rate, the movie shows the heartbreak and hard work of immigrants who maybe just need a break, but often don't get one.",1410825600,,841,4.467532467532467
8304563,4,B001G9CNIG,"this film is more about the intricacies of human nature (than the american dream) which shaped through particular experiences also has the potential to be shaped again. a young thug masquerading as the son of an illegal immigrant dishwasher who though old still pines for his love back home. the real son deprived of his identification forced to endure the brutalities of the dark/seamy side of the city. this movie is about how this particular situation changes all the people caught up in it. the thug is stricken by remorse and conscience about having to gyp the old man. the old man initially suspicious and reluctant to accept his ""son"" slowly warms up to the boy. the real son though innocent is forced to reconcile with the brutalities of the street and adapt himself to the situation. brisk, compelling, brutal ... and tragic.",1259712000,2,834,4.839160839160839
8304564,3,B001G9CNIG,"""Sangre De Mi Sangre,""  translated as ""Blood of My Blood,"" was the Grand Jury Prize winner at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival.  Determined to find the father (Jesus Ochoa) he has never met, a young man (Jorge Adrian Espindola) flees the slums of Mexico and heads to the mean streets of New York City.  When a shrewd thief (Armando Hernandez) steals his identity and schemes to rob the father he has so desperately been seeking, both men unexpectedly find themselves bound for the dark side of the American Dream.  This thriller about survival illustrates that both immigrants and the people who try to exploit them are capable of evil.  There is a great deal of suspense created and sustained as we follow the saga of people exploited in a new, often hostile environment.  The New York City locations, so familiar from their appearance in so many movies, often take on a menacing aura, as the plight of the immigrants in America frequently appears to be worse than it was in Mexico.  Written and directed by Christopher Zalla, ""Sangre De Mi Sangre"" is in Spanish with English subtitles.  There are no bonus extras.",1230422400,2,1114,4.765625
8304565,4,B001G9CNIG,"The acting is excellent in this dark look at the seamy side of life among some of the less fortunate illegal Mexican immigrants. Jesus Ochoa, Armando Hernandez, and Paola Mendoza give especially compelling performances, and the rest of the cast seems perfect for their parts.  Ochoa's portrayal of Diego is surprisingly complex and ultimately sympathetic.

The story is at times hopeful but mostly focuses on the tough situations that these illegal Mexicans experience and how those experiences shape their lives and outlook on life.

While the dialogue is full of the sleazy language of these hardened unfortunates, it adds realism to the seedy life style of the characters in the film.  As the plot unfolded, I found myself more and more absorbed in the fateful plight of each of the main characters.

I'll refrain from commenting on the details of the story because I believe that seeing the story develop without much knowledge of what lies ahead will add to the impact that this film can have.

I give it a strong 4 stars.",1229904000,6,1027,4.873563218390805
8304566,3,B001G9CNIG,"This movie was a great movie, it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Great acting endeed. HOWEVER.....I felt i wasted almost two hours of my life when i saw the ending. Since the begining of the movie you ""kinda"" know and hope what the ending will be. ""NOT !! this one"". It leaves you HANGING wondering  ""ok NOW WHAT?...."" I was very disapointed. OHHH  Juan, I hope you get cought, what you did was not very nice man..........So for those who have yet to see this movie, be prepared for a long wild ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat but with an uncertain ending.!!!!!",1229904000,3,599,4.2
8304567,5,B001G9CNIG,"SANGRE DE MI SANGRE (also known as PADRE NUESTRO) is a fast-paced, raw, and rather brutal indictment against the cruelty immigrants face upon entering this country.  Written and directed by Christopher Zalla the film may cover territory becoming a bit overexposed in cinema of late, but the story is so well told and acted that it rises to the top of the films currently available about the experiences immigrants (from Mexico, in this case) endure in trying to better their lives under the torch of the Statue of Liberty!

The film opens in Mexico where a young criminal Juan (Armando Hern&aacute;ndez) narrowly escapes his pursuers by jumping over the border fence and landing in a situation where a coyote (corrupt border guard) is loading his truck with immigrants to transport them for cash to New York. The street-wise Juan is one of many stuffed into a truck and happens to sit by a young illiterate lad his age named Pedro (Jorge Adri&aacute;n Esp&iacute;ndola) who is on his way to meet his father who lives in New York ('a man who owns a restaurant') but whom Pedro has never seen (he carries with him a letter to his father from his recently deceased mother).  Through all manner of staging errors and transportation glitches, the two young boys, full of dreams of a better future in America, land in New York.  Juan loses his money and his ID and steals from his  newfound friend. Pedro encounters a streetwalker named Magda (Paola Mendoza) who promises to help Pedro find his father Diego (Jes&uacute;s Ochoa).  But Jaun has found the dishwasher Diego first, claims to be his son, and causes confusion and discord in Diego's life. How the two lads manage to survive the complexities of life in Brooklyn and are swept up in the raw life of crime that surrounds the lives of illegal immigrants makes for a complicated story, but one filled with unforgettable characters and emotions.

This film had an unfortunately brief run in the theaters.  It is a well-made film in every aspect and deserves  wider audience which now, on DVD , it just may reach.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, October 08",1223596800,11,2105,4.790055248618785
