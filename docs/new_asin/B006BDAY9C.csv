8496020,5,B006BDAY9C,"I've taken classes with Nadine on making lavender sachets, fabric baskets, and pine needle baskets.  She is a wonderful teacher in person, but I wondered how well I could learn a new craft from video alone.  Well, not to worry!  I just purchased the DVD a few months ago and have made almost a dozen lavender wreaths so far.  In addition to lavender, I like the adventure of hunting the neighborhood for more flowering plants to add the varieties Nadine suggests to use.
The DVD is beautifully made.  Excellent quality of sound and visuals.  Easy to follow Nadine's instructions.  It's a fun craft - TRY IT!",1328486400,2,607,4.669811320754717
8496021,5,B006BDAY9C,"This is Nadine's third DVD and is a great primer on making a lavender wreath. Since the lavender season was over when I got the DVD, I used her techniques to make Christmas wreaths. I just inserted fall leaves from our yard instead of lavender and it is February and we still have the wreath hanging on our front door. The DVD is so thorough in how to gather supplies and materials and how to coil the wreath so it looks good on both sides! The chapters set up in the DVD let you go back and view any section that you want for a refresher. Thanks, Nadine for another wonderful lesson!",1328140800,2,584,4.223214285714286
8496022,5,B006BDAY9C,"I really enjoyed Nadine's Lavender Field's DVD.  I am a novice weaver, but this DVD spoke right to my soul and after watching it once, I gathered the materials and went through it a second time this time actually creating. Nadine's step-by-step directions made it fairly simple for me to follow and actually weave a basket.  I am now working on a lavender wreath!  She has an easy, instructive manner which made all the difference for me as I don't work so well in a classroom setting.  I would highly recommend purchasing this DVD.",1327190400,4,532,4.627659574468085
