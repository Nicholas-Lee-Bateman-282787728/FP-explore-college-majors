8723285,5,B0112HPSUQ,"This is the second of the 2 holiday-themed Nick Out of the Vault DVDs by Shout Factory, this time centered on Christmas (and also Thanksgiving for Hey Arnold and Arbor Day, Beaver Christmas, for the Angry Beavers)! This volume contains the Christmas AND Thanksgiving episodes of Hey Arnold, CatDog's Christmas special, Rocko's Modern Christmas, The Angry Beavers' Christmas/Arbor Day episode, and a repeat from the first non-holiday volume... of the Monsters' night in a closed mall with a Christmas in July sale, and the ""Lahmp""! There are 4 other episodes in here not related to any holiday, Heaven knows how or why! Nevertheless, this'll go great with the Halloween volume and all the non-holiday Out of the Vault DVDs! If you don't wanna go through the season or series sets of these shows at Halloween or Christmas, the Halloween and Christmas Out of the Vault DVDs are in single convenient packages! Merry Christmas, everybody (a month late)!",1516406400,3,948,5.044585987261146
