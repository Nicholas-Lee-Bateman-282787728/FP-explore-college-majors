It seemed to be 'sloppy' or 'gloppy'....but I think it is partly due to my expectations.  I wanted to invest in a DVD that offered up more detail and a more quality finished product.",1240963200,,340,4.380952380952381
8310265,5,B001HZY1PW,"As usual, I got worried before Halloween, like... what on earth can we do with the kids (I have four) that can be fun. To buy the usual costumes and masks... not again. Then my cousin Tracy told me about the great DVD she just bought, with all kinds of ideas for face painting. I told her I t sounded great but I hardly know make up, and she said that was just the point. So I said, what the hell, I'll give it a shot. And what do you know? Coooool. We found ourselves all weekend painting each other's faces, and it was so funny and lively. I never believed I could do a ""Batman"" or ""Spiderman"" face mask so easily. We had great fun... the How-to-do is colourful and easy, and the beautiful costume and mask parade has in it something of the ""Baby Mozart"" effect. Little Wendy goes to sleep every night watching children turn into fairies and bunnies. Now they all want to be make up artists...",1225670400,,895,4.239766081871345

Fun, easy and clear instructions make face painting look professional.
Highly recommended!",1225670400,,205,5.242424242424242
8310267,5,B001HZY1PW,This DVD is a great hit in our home. My children watch it again and again. They don't care so much about the makeup; they are amazed to see the children on screen transformed to animals. For Halloween we bought some face paints and we intend to try few of the makeup from the DVD.,1225152000,,280,4.109090909090909
