The line stretched from the doors to the Moore Theater in Seattle around the corner and about one block back. We were all waiting to get in to the second show of the Kyle Cease taping of his one hour Comedy Central special, ""Weirder. Blacker. Dimpler."" A random dude in a bar across the street yelled out, ""What's up Kevin CEASE!?"" Coming around from the theater was Kevin Cease, Kyle's younger brother, who was filming the crowd for a documentary. While everyone ahead in line made cool looking gestures and shouted at the camera, I casually pointed at it as I told my wife who Kevin was. We all slowly shuffled our way into the theater lobby and made our way to our seats. My wife and I were in the absolute front row and the chairs were fit snuggly together at best. It was the closest thing to a movie set we'd ever been on. There were cameras on big mechanical arms, camera-men on and off stage, and up on the stage sat a single ""Terms and Conditions Notice"" from the production company, New Wave Entertainment.

The couple sitting next to us had come all the way from Alaska and mentioned they had seen Kyle outside before the show. ""We were like, Hey! We're the couple who told you on Myspace that we were flying down from Alaska! And he was like, Oh yeah! And even remembered our names!"" they said (not in unison, but you get the idea.) A dude in a gray Army t-shirt sitting behind me, told me it was his first time to a live comedy show and that he didn't know what to expect. He warned me that even if he has to climb over my shoulders, he WILL get a high five from Kyle. A man from the production team took the stage to film a couple establishing shots for the special. All of a sudden we were asked to laugh hysterically on cue followed by standing to our feet and cheering whole heartedly. Following this little bit of ""acting"" was a fantastic warm up set from Bob Bledsoe, where he explained that he believes the best UFC fighting style combination is Karate and Fencing. As Bob exited the stage, we all realized it was finally time.

After taking the stage, Kyle welcomed us to his special and noted that his father once took him as a boy to this same theater to see Ellen Degeneres. Little by little, as the details of this very fond childhood memory changed, we realized that the comedic journey had begun. His material was so fast and consistent that my face was getting sore from the smiling and laughing, and my wife (who was really pregnant) started getting mild contractions. One thing about being at a live taping that is set apart from watching the finished product, is that sometimes there are ""do-overs"" during the taping. On many occasions, Kyle would tell a joke or make an off-the-cuff remark that either had to many swear words or used the name of a liscened product. In those cases, he would just do the same joke again with a modified punchline. You might think that doing a joke over would make it much less exciting or funny, but in a weird way, it kind of made them funnier. My hats off to any comic who is able to pull something like that off.

What I have always found most remarkable about Kyle's stand up (and this show was no exception), is his ability to be fast, loose, and riff with the audience without loosing his train of thought, or slowing down the show. He is very cutting edge and innovative when it comes to writing jokes and stays focused on the moment as to not miss any opportunity for added laughs. A highlight for me was when Kyle called-back to a joke in his previous special and then called forward to a joke yet to be told in this one. The time between the call-forward and the actual joke, unknowingly built this anticipation amongst the audience so that when the moment finally arrived, we were all suddenly cheering. It was a quite a feat to behold.

Kyle Cease is undoubtedly weird, but after the number of times I heard him say the words ""lube"" and ""vagina,"" I have to agree that for this performance, he was definitely weirder. The all black stage off set by only the huge lit up marquee made the show more than noticably blacker than the last special but was Kyle somehow dimpler? You'll just have to watch and decide for yourself.

I shut this off after 10 minutes because it was too painful to continue. This is probably the least funny comedy special I have ever seen in my life.",1314662400,,155,4.166666666666667

I will say that the production value of the DVD is kind of amateurish, but overall still a good find.  His humor is not rude or self-depricating, so he is right up my alley.",1215302400,,328,4.09375
8222180,1,B000WC39EU,"Wow!

I must say this guy is the worst comedian of all time! His bland, childish humor was incredibly stupid and annoying ... all rolled up in one!!!!

If you want:
1. the most politically correct material (North Western blandness)
2. to roll your eyes in tear jerking madness of stupidity
3. to be bored to tears
4. to look at the clock in anticipation of this joker's bit to end

Then look no futher! The worst comedy stand up of all time is right here waiting for you!

Please Kyle ... Cease your act!",1214956800,2,504,4.273684210526316

I cried while watching this special.  That's how funny Kyle Cease is.  Period. That's it.  (happy tears are in fact the best kind of tears)

His style of comedy is unusual, meaning his jokes just flow out of him like water.  Each sentence is a joke.

He's my favorite comedian and I hope I get a chance to see him live.",1198540800,4,342,4.090909090909091
