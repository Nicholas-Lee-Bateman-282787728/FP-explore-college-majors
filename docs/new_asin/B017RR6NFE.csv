7513511,3,B017RR6NFE,"You wanted a shot, there's your shot."" Brody James (Barnett) is one of the best MMA fighters in the world and is training to take on one of the biggest and meanest in a title fight. He enlists the help of Case Walker (White), an amazing fighter but one who does things his way. After James suffers an injury the promoter decides Case will take his place, but the more Case finds out about what happened the more he second guesses his decision to fight. There isn't really a whole lot to say about this movie. It is entertaining and watchable, but pretty predictable, a little cheesy...pretty much exactly what you would expect. This is worth watching and some people will really enjoy this, but don't expect Warrior or Rocky. The fight scenes are great and realistic looking, but the drama and acting leaves a little to be desired. Overall, a decent fighting movie that would have been better with more action and less acting. It is OK though. I give this a B-.",1464998400,4,961,4.528735632183908

7513653,5,B017RR6NFE,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I admit to being a fan of MJW, and this film was direted and co-written by him in addition to his reprising his role as Case Walker, ex-convict MMA fighter/instructor. His Walker has gotten over his foul mood by this point, courtesy of his students in the previous film, and White plays him with a lighter and more amiable touch here. The martial arts on display here are the real deal, and breathtakingly shot. The fight scenes can rival those of any major hong kong martial arts films  of recent years, and it's apparent White is putting everything he's learned in the business over the decades to use here. If there's anything to criticize about this venture, it is that Walker (and to an extent, White) is elevated to a near mythical level in terms of ability and presence, so much so that some tension leading up to the final battle is reduced. Still, this film is a solid martial arts film that will likely please fans of the genre.",1483833600,,979,4.531073446327683

7514618,4,B017RR6NFE,"I am a big fan of MJW, loved him in Blood and Bone, and Falcon, etc. The main reason I watched this film was that it was filmed in Thailand, a country that I love, and included appearances of two of my favorite Thai action stars, Tony Jaa and Jeeja Yanin. Needless to say, I was enthralled by the scene that had Jeeja fighting in the ring against a Bullying male opponent, a scene that was electric and enabled Jeeja to put her skills on display for a Western audience. Thank you MJW for giving Jeeja her shot. We need more of Thailand.",1465257600,,536,4.213592233009709
7514619,5,B017RR6NFE,"As a martial artist, I appreciate realistic cinematic representations of valuable martial arts principles, concepts and methods. This film has that. Most traditional martial artists hope to find an entertaining experience that can motivate beginning or younger students. This has done that. Fans of MMA will find that they can relate to the experience as well.

One of the few films that shows traditional (""Old School"") methods in a realistic light. Never Back Down 3: No Surrender respects the original traditions of Karate and its values while having an updated presentation. A hard task, but well done by the cast and crew of this film.

I highly recommend this film to any martial arts enthusiast, practitioner or teacher. There's much to appreciate here.",1465257600,,760,5.170731707317073

He is recruited by his buddy Brody (Josh Barnett) to train him for a title match in Thailand. Case Walker is old school and has a ""disruptive presence."" Blah Blah Blah, formula formula formula.

Needless to say the whole film was predictable after the first few minutes, or even by looking at the DVD cover. That is not to say it was bad. Michael Jai White gave us a character to rally around, even though we knew the outcome. The main problem I had was that the lead up fights were better than the climax fight done in slow motion with a lumbering opponent (Nathan Jones) waiting to be hit. That was real lousy shooting and editing on that final battle.

Tony Jaa in a very minor role.
