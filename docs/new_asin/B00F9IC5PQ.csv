5971897,5,B00F9IC5PQ,"I had see this series at an anime club in California and knew then I wanted it for my collection. The characters are so unexpected...SIster Rosette, an orphaned 16-year-old, one of a gun-toting, car-driving, plain-spoken group nuns who are part of an organization comprised of cleric-like characters dedicated to fighting supernatural evil; a vanquished demon in the form of a 10-year-old boy and Sister Rosette's companion, and--if he were older--would probably like to be her lover; Rosette's brother who has powers the Other Side wishes to use, if he ever is cured of the unknown illness plaguing him, and assorted demons and devils with recognizable names.  Set in the '20's, it's violent, funny, and at times downright poignant. The ending brings it up to date at the time the series was made with an actual historical event.

It's good to watch several episodes at a time because of the many flashbacks which could be confusing if much time elapses between viewings. The whole thing definitely requires a ""willing suspension of disbelief"" but once you do that, you'll enjoy it immensely.",1420243200,6,1093,5.066666666666666
5971898,2,B00F9IC5PQ,"This is a review of the SAVE version but should apply to other versions too. Chrono Crusade is a wasted opportunity. It tells the story of an unusual agreement between a demon and a nun and how they save the world. It's set in the late 1920s although this setting isn't really exploited very well apart from giving the animators the challenge of drawing cars from that period. Baccano does this period so much better.

It weaves several back stories together but doesn't give one of the main stories sufficient prominence. The rise of the sinners such as Chrono and Aion and the conflict that caused them to wage war on the denizens of hell is mentioned but should have occupied more of the episodes.

What really lets this down is the sound track. The opportunity clearly existed to make an anime that was as powerful as corpse princess. The complex nature of the stories, the potential in the milieu, the actual endings all should have made this an easy five out of five anime. It is ruined by some sloppy mistakes  such as Brooklym (!), Magdalam and conflicting titles. Also is it Chrono crusade or Chrn crusade? They're used interchangeably.

The biggest crime is the soundtrack. You're being seriously let down if you think you could do better yourself in an afternoon and that's clearly the case. The german accent of Satella Harvenheit is a new low for this accent. Awful. The voices and portrayal of Rosette and Azmaria with their too loud screaming and screeching are offensive to the ears. They ruin the atmosphere of the episodes to such an extent that you'd happily cut them from any scene where they have to speak. This would make the whole thing much shorter and a lot better. The portrayal of Rosette nearly made me stop watching. Why, oh why didn't they give Rosette the gravitas of Makina in corpse princess? The character of Rosette was set in the original Japanese production but made worse by the voices chosen for the English dub in particular (the Japanese isn't much better btw).",1415491200,,2002,4.695156695156695

5971901,4,B00F9IC5PQ,"This is a four disc version of the series originally published in the US by the now defunct ADV.  The original series was released in Japan in 2003/ 2004 and the US in 2006.  I've only viewed the Japanese audio with English subtitles, so I can comment on the quality of the Japanese cast, but not on the English dub (since I rarely watch anime in English).  The series is 24 episodes and clocks in at 600 minutes.

The series is based on a somewhat interesting idea of Christianity.  The series is set in America (New York mostly) in the 1920s.  The Order of Magdalene is a sort of fighting sect of an unnamed branch of Christianity.  They specialize in exorcising demons, and in true action anime fashion, they do this by beating the baddie senseless first.  The action is silly, often over the top, but don't let the goofy fighting sequences throw you off.  Underneath is a well told story.  In fact, you really have to put your knowledge (if you have any) of Christianity aside as well (much as one has to do for Evangelion).

The story revolves around Chrono, a demon who is assisting the Order in combating Aion, the demon bent on enslaving humanity.  There are a lot of interesting stories from the various characters' pasts, but Rosette and Chrono definitely have the darker and more interesting pasts.  Throughout the series, the viewer is introduced to their past and the ways in which these two are bonded.  What begins as a sort of unwanted partnership develops into a friendship and perhaps something more (no spoilers) - despite the obvious taboo.  Throughout the series, the Order and others fear and attempt to manipulate Chrono for their own means, but Rosette continues to defend him.  This is the core of the story that is so appealing.

So four stars - mainly because of a few areas:  the often over the top fight sequences (typically with minor demons) are a bit much for the underlying serious tone of the series.  Also the obvious and glaring errors with history - albeit this is a very fictionalized history - but the errors are often cringe worthy.  It's nothing to bring the show to a screeching halt, but it does get a little tiring.  Especially all of the secret and futuristic weapons and such.  The animation is a little dated, especially the CG effects the pop up periodically.  Granted it is Gonzo that was responsible, so the animation is top quality by 2003 standards.

Overall this is a solid series, and it is well worth a purchase through the S.A.V.E. series from Funimation.  I still have my copy of the old ADV version and it's a great one to dust off occasionally and watch.  It's not one of the great series of all time, but it shows that occasional flash of brilliance that keeps one wanting to watch more.  Otherwise it's just solid storytelling.

Another series with a similar theme but done very well is 'Witch Hunter Robin'.  Less Christianity focus and more focus on a secret underground society with evil intentions.",1389916800,6,2963,4.644230769230769

5971911,5,B00F9IC5PQ,"As a fan when it was release over a decade ago, I was happy to see this again through Funimation's SAVE collections. In fact, I am so grateful to Funimation for providing us with these sets. While I did originally see this entire anime, I never did own it. Now, I do. The premise of this anime is of Sister Rosette and her ever so kind yet contracted to, Chrono the devil. The dub is fantastic and does a great job connecting you to these characters which you do end up feeling for. How harsh they're treated, to how well together they are suited. It's been years since I have seen this anime so I am getting back into re-watching the entire series. For any anime fan out there, and for those of this setting, I recommend this series.",1441152000,,734,4.287769784172662

8613438,5,B00F9IC5PQ,"At first it seems like ""nuns with guns"": in 1929 New York, demons begin appearing, only to be beaten back by the Magdalene Order of teenage nuns, led by Rosette Christopher, and her demonic assistant. There's an apocalyptic war afoot, and one of the pawns is Rosette's brother Joshua. Act 1 takes place in New York, act 2 in San Francisco; then the final 4 episodes (Act 3) jump back in time 50 years to show the various characters creating the karma of their past lives that have to be dealt with decades later. This isn't really a spoiler, since it adds a layer to the storytelling that makes this series more than just an animated video game. As is usual with anime versions of Christianity, it is totally unorthodox, but the makers don't worry about theology and the viewer shouldn't either. It's a gripping, moving, and visually impressive story.",1515283200,,851,4.68
