This man, even whilst watching him on my TV, I get the sense that this man knows more authentic tango than most, and we are just getting a piece of the iceberg. Not to confuse, this man is giving...there is a lot on here. I have had some live classes with Anton too, and he is just as generous in class with material. I have always felt that other teachers skimp in order for you to grab them for a private lesson, not with Anton...he gives and gives. I just love his DVDs. This DVD took my tango to a whole new level. I cannot wait to pull some extra money together to buy Vol 2.",1390953600,2,668,4.030075187969925

I don't want to pontificate, but I just have to say something.....please bear with me.

Tango is supposed to be about improvisation....""you must dance the music"", it is often said. Often I hear people say ""that you don't learn improvisation by learning patterns"". Everytime I hear this I cringe. It makes me realize just how little this person really knows about the tango.

Just ask any great classical or jazz musician how they got good....Did they have to learn the structure of music? Did they ever learn chords? What did they practice in the beginning....and what do they practice now that they are good? Did they play other peoples musical compositions? Many of the answers that you receive relate to and give insight to practicing the tango.

It must also be realized that you don't begin you training in ""freedom"". But to become a ""maestro"" that is where you MUST end. ""Freedom must be earned"".

So, let's just think about it for a while.......continue to bear with me here.......

Set patterns, presented in a logical and progressive fashion (simple to more complex), give you examples of how to use and combine various movements. In a way, they become the heart of improvisation. If you cannot achieve a desired outcome as laid out in a given, known sanario, how on earth will you achieve a desired result in an unknown predicament, as is often encountered on a crowded dance floor.

So, these patterns/sequences give you a launch pad to start from in building you knowledge and physical skills. They present many senarios and lay out possible responses all in the form of movement. With practice and patience everything will come together in an integrative way. This is why a good methodology is so very important.

With a good methodology everything you learn will make sense, building on previously laid down skill sets, in a progression from simple to more sophisticated. Take into account that by sophisticated, I don't mean difficult, but rather ""simple sophistication"". There is a big difference here. To the untrained eye, something may appear complex and difficuilt but to the trained eye it is just simplicity stacked/layered upon itself. Being patient in your study of a particular methodology should eventually reveal this to you.

When learned this way the movement becomes a part of you.....or rather it becomes you. The two are inseperable, not just a pattern or sequence that you regurgitate. Those who have learnt a few patterns are the ""regurgitators"", what they do is very ugly. Those who have learnt the patterns of an entire system...they become the really good dancers, what they do becomes beauty.

Therefore, the wise student ""in search of the elusive tango"" will stick with a set methodology presented by ""an instructor"" (not by many instructors as is the common belief) and often perpetuated by what I call ""the Tango Festival Mentality""...that these ""Festivals"" are where you must go to learn tango. The contrary is probably much more true. Really, think about the festivals you have attented? How much did you really learn?...be honest. Was it really worth all that money? Airfare, accomodations, food...festival and milonga admission? It really adds up.

But ""Tango Festivals"" can provide you with inspiration and the comradery of other like minded individuals. They are more the venue for the person who already has some skill dancing. For the skilled dancer the festival ""Milonga"" is a wonderful place to reconnect with old friends and make new ones.

It is said ""you don't choose tango...that the tango chooses you"". So a word of advice to you aspiring tangueros and tangueras....find yourself a good instructor. There is no substitute for the knowledge of a dedicated instructor. No DVD can be of any real substitute. Give it time and most of all practice, practice, practice! The tango and all it's wonderful secrets will be revealed to those who try. You will be rewarded many times over when you take that special partner into you arms and the two of you are transported around the dance floor on the heals of the music.

But if you cannot find that great ""teacher/instructor"" these DVD's are a great place to start.

Hope to see you....or better yet, dance with you sometime at the ""Milonga"".",1323216000,6,4284,4.9484679665738165
