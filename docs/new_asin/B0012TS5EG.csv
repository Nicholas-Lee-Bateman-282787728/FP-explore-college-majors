They really mesh and even look similar.  That's a phenomanon I've seen in some great bands. In any case, he is equal musically to holdsworth and they seem to speak the same language, which really makes this about music not just about one man.  H gets 3 songs. P gets 3 songs.

3098788,5,B0012TS5EG,"This is - hands down - the best DVD performance of the most brilliant musicians that still exist in the world today. I got chills down the spine watching these guys play and I want to thank them for releasing this concert to the world. Thanks Allan and Alan, Chad and Jimmy. You guys are amazing! I have seen Allan Holdsworth in concert  three different times. Once back in the seventies with UK (with Bruford, Wetton & Jobson) and once in the late eighties (with Gary Husband, Alan Pasqua and Jimmy Johnson) and once again in the early nineties (with Chad Wackerman and Jimmy Johnson) and this performance is equal to any of the performances I've seen and still playing at top-notch level. The most amazing thing about this is that  they don't even have a fancy light show, nor do they play in large venues (this one's in a sushi bar!). They are quite low key, but deliver something more powerful than few in the world of music can deliver. Just incredible to watch and hear. And no, they don't  jump around or shake their bums - they just play! Allan Holdsworth has not lost his touch in all these years and I believe he is even better (if that is humanly possible!) and here his amazing finger work is displayed in all it's glory and for the first time on an official release DVD. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jimmy Haslip playing bass with the band. I got to see Jimmy play back in 95 with the Yellow Jackets and became a big fan. I also have a couple of his solo CDs and have enjoyed them alot. But here he performs above and beyond anything I've heard him play before. Very Jaco-like. And of course Alan Pasqua and Chad Wackerman are incredible. This DVD is something that is a must-own. It is like gold, especially in todays world of sadly bland popular music.",1214611200,5,1772,4.412844036697248

3098790,5,B0012TS5EG,"This is just a ""must have"" for any Holdsworth fan. It is expensive but the quality is incredibe. The other reviewer states that Alan Pasqua is ""the weak link""??? Alan Pasqua is brilliant and every solo he takes is stunning!!(amazing really) He gets incredible sounds out of his NORD synth!! Sheer sonic beauty from his synth. Holdsworth has no ""weak links"" in his bands. Wackerman is killer and under-stated as always and the bass playing is great as well. I had the opportunity to seem Holdsworth live 6 months ago and he was incredible as always. Rather than telling him how great he was when I spoke to him I asked :What did you think of how you played tonight""? He said (exact quote: ""I s_ ck_d!"".
I shouldn't have been surprised because he is EXTREMELY self-critical but this guy communicates with aliens folks. He is one of the premier guitar beings on this planet. People will study him long after he's gone. A genius working in our lifetime! If you want Holdsworth footage this is the best so far in terms of pro-shot quality. Stay away from that ""live at the galaxy"" thing. BUY THIS!",1207872000,15,1092,4.576530612244898
3098791,5,B0012TS5EG,"If you've never had the chance to see Allan in concert, or if you just want to hear some great jazz featuring one of the most innovative guitar players ever, jamming with some killer musicians, pick this up.

This is Allan's first approved concert DVD (the initial release was April 2007) and it's about time fans got a professional quality product with spectacular audio (mixes in 5.1 surround and stereo) and video footage that is sharp and clear. The 81-minute disc is phenomenal and there is a good mix of songs, a few written by Tony Williams. There are numerous times Allan is not playing and he's just kicking back listening to the other band members jam. Alan Pasqua is a solid keyboard player and his solos are decent, but for me, he's the weak link in this group. I'm not familiar with the bass playing of Jimmy Haslip but on this performance he burns, and Chad Wackerman, one of my favorite drummers, is tasty, creative, and grooves like a monster. If you think brilliant musicians no longer exist, you need to experience this for yourself. Chances are your jaw will be on the floor throughout the entire performance.

There is a brief pause between the ends of each song, the video fades to black, and the title of the next song appears on the screen, so I'm not sure if the entire show was documented. Unfortunately, the DVD has no extras and it is pricey but highly recommended.",1202342400,14,1392,4.586345381526105

It's a little late for me to take real action.  I'm sure the video is great, since the band is outstanding, and Holdsworth is over-the-top good.

8247781,5,B0012TS5EG,"I first heard Holdsworth on a Billy Cobham LP back in the fusion heyday.  Nice guitarist, I thought.  It wasn't till I saw him opening for the inaugural tour of the Chick Corea Elektrik Band, that I came to appreciate his genius.  As so often, Wackerman was with him for that date.  Fast forward umpteen years, I'm building up a music DVD collection of some old fusion favs and come across this absolutely amazing outing.  I was kicking myself when I found this because Yoshi's is in my back yard.  Oh to have been there that night!

Folks, this is absolutely amazing stuff.  Some of the finest fusion I've encountered as a fan down through the decades from those early Miles, Head Hunters, RTF, Weather Report, Eleventh House, and of course, Tony Williams days.

Haslip was a revelation.  Who'd'a thunk the Yellowjackets smooth sounds bassist would be so amazing on a set like this?

I've been a fan of Pasqua for years - in all his guises.  Check out his acoustic recordings if you're a fan of piano jazz - fantastic, lyrical, enticing player.  You get a taste of this in the intro to San Michele.  He's equally at home here in a hard fusion setting, coaxing some wonderfully inventive sounds from whatever keyboard that is (the red one beside the Korg - sorry, not enough of a keyboard wonk to be able to ID it).

And speaking of lyrical, I don't think there is a contemporary fusion drummer that bespeaks ""lyrical"" the way Wackerman does.  All of his stuff down through the years as Holdsworth's sideman is great and, more recently, he's become a fine leader.  Along with some of Dennis Chambers' dates, the finest fusion drummers on scene today.

And, of course, there aren't enough superlatives for Holdsworth.  He's just simply amazing.

If you love fusion, or are looking to sample what is out there, this is it.  Until the RTF Returns Live at Montreux 2008 DVD came out, I'd called this the finest fusion DVD available.  A must own!  And here I am as delighted with it as the day I first got it.",1362096000,,2004,4.551820728291316
8247782,5,B0012TS5EG,This is a dream team of fusion players and they prove it.  The venue and audience add to the quality of the performance.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of fusion.,1358640000,,178,4.057142857142857
8247783,4,B0012TS5EG,"This could be subtitled, All Music, No Filler.  The upside is, the music is great.  Fine performances by fine players.  Holdsworth, for those who haven't heard him, is a fabulous guitar virtuoso who can play anything he wants at any speed, and with the musical imagination to want some pretty remarkable things.  Very impressive and musically inspiring.

The sound is pretty good.  A decent mix, and it's possible to hear most of what the soloists are doing without straining too much.

If you buy this expecting an impressive production to match the quality of the music, look elsewhere.  The visuals are minimal, given the age we live in.  The stage lighting is very basic, even missing spotlights of any sort.  All you get are the musicians standing there doing what they do best.  It would have been nice to have an interview, at the very least, but this is lacking, too.",1355702400,,875,4.728476821192053
8247784,5,B0012TS5EG,"Well, once again, Holdsworth surrounds himself with amazing players and everyone puts forward an amazing performance.  Haslip is incredible backing up Chad Wackerman and Pasqua pulls out some amazing sounds with his keys.  The sound quality is exceptional in this video.  Really fantastic buy for fellow music heads.",1308873600,,316,5.541666666666667
8247785,5,B0012TS5EG,"I live in Columbus Ohio, Allan has been here 10 times since 84, all of which I attended, I've had the chance to have dinner with him before a concert and have had drinks and have talked with him 8 out of the 10, he is exactly as he comes off if you have ever watched his instructional videos.. Indeed one of the greatest players of all times, Andreas Segovia (""Father of the classical guitar"")once said that Allan was the best guitarist he ever heard. His phrasing and soloing are unmatched, and yet a real humble guy. This video is one of the best so far I've seen (and I have them all), regardless of of some other's opinions get them all... every Allan Holdsworth video is a must have, but this one is of the best quality!",1253923200,,725,4.260869565217392
8247786,5,B0012TS5EG,"Incredible DVD, buy it.  I watched it 5-6 times in the first month I had it.  Holdsworth's playing is jaw-dropping, and the band is equally up to task.  I had heard of Alan Pasqua (keyboards) but didn't know how talented he was until now.  I've been a Chad Wackerman (drums) fan since 'Road Games', and he's fun to watch.  Very well filmed and produced DVD, great sound.  Watch it with a good sound system.  Very happy with this DVD.",1251676800,2,433,4.405063291139241
8247787,5,B0012TS5EG,"This is a great DVD with super audio and video quality. I'm a fan of all the players, especially Jimmy Haslip who is the bass player for my favorite jazz group the Yellowjackets. My only gripe is that the drummer, Chad Wackerman,plays with very little emotion or passion behind the drumkit. Being a drummer myself this is tough to watch at times. It still gets five stars for the great mucical content.",1236124800,2,402,4.597222222222222
