4830176,5,B005LSPKWY,This was instructed very well and after watching it twice I could duplicate what was being taught. It was as described it was designed to give you a good basic background that you can build on. I would encourage any one who uses a cane or a walking stick umbrella to view it.,1395446400,7,275,4.2075471698113205
4830177,5,B005LSPKWY,"I have been a big fan of the cane as a self-defense option ever since I began to explore the possibilities while recovering from an accident some years ago. In my search for instructional materials on the cane I have viewed a fair number of videos purporting to teach a method of self-defense. Many of them have a martial arts orientation, incorporating techniques that to the beginner can seem dauntingly complex and difficult to execute. Fancy moves that require years of practice on the mat are likely to vanish from memory under the highly stressful conditions of an actual assault. Although such complete systems can be quite good, they are not suitable for the ordinary person who is looking for a few powerful moves that can be quickly and easily acquired. Kelly Wordens simple and street-effective method can be learned in a short time and put to use immediately by anyone, regardless of age and level of fitness. (I am 72 years old, & I can easily perform all the moves shown on the discs.) Mr. Wordens instruction will give you confidence, a good base for further training, and the inspiration to further develop your skills. Purchase this set and get started!",1390521600,47,1170,4.797029702970297
4830178,5,B005LSPKWY,very detailed and shows the moves that is needed in defending one self with a cane. Recommend this book to anyone wanting to defend themselves with a cane.,1375660800,,155,4.571428571428571
4830179,5,B005LSPKWY,"This review may come off a little biased since I've known Kelly Worden for over 30 years, back when he was a tough Karate fighter and competitor, and later when I studied Arnis with him in the early 80s. Kelly's the REAL DEAL and his wealth of knowledge in combined martial arts (he is a Filipino Stick & Knife Fighting Master) only makes what he offers on the DVD something more to listen to and seriously consider. He speaks of Defensive tactics with a cane as a useful weapon with authority and not something he just picked up in a Karate or Tae Kwon Do class as a way to achieve another colored belt but with DECADES of Arnis/Escrima/Kali and JKD practice. He has studied with the best and it shows, which is how he has achieved his prominent place in the Martial Arts community as well as the military community, earning high praise from the Special Forces. So like I said I'm a little biased about his skills and fighting prowess.
  While this two DVD set covers ten essential fighting techniques (in repetition to drill the techniques into your practice and thus enhancing a memory device) he also covers some other useful considerations; i.e.- foot traps, distancing, flow, legal ramifications,etc. The price is well worth what you'll take away from the DVDs and is worth every penny, if you only ever need to rely on one or two of the techniques in a real defensive situation.
  Finally, as a former contributing editor to several national martial arts publications I have seen many martial artists come and go. Those, like Datu Kelly Worden, who stay with it, are the ones that make all the difference. Check out kellyworden.com",1369958400,28,1638,4.677083333333333
4830180,5,B005LSPKWY,"Handicapped and using a cane?  Some would call that a target, especially if you have a long way to walk in a dimly lit parking lot.  The techniques in this book could help you get outta a difficult situation.",1367798400,,208,4.3076923076923075
4830181,2,B005LSPKWY,Everything worth learning could have been reduced to 5 -10 minutes--that's one sequence of 10 strikes which is a good beginner's introduction to the subject. The rest is painful--I don't think the amiable instructor knows the meaning of many of the words he uses.,1365465600,11,263,5.0
4830182,5,B005LSPKWY,"This 2 disk set is great for those in fairly good physical shape. I am 58 and in generally good condition. I can do this. To say that an elderly 70 year old can do this is not realistic and I don't see any advertisement or claims that this is the case.

This set includes the simple basics in the first disk then the more involved actions in the second disk. This is easily worth the price. There are no holds, kicks, or flips in this set. This is simply a lesson basic in cane self defense that many can use.

I will be buying other cane self defense sets from Amazon, but I am perfectly happy with this purchase. As I said this is good stuff and I highly recommend it.",1360281600,25,670,4.068181818181818
4830183,5,B005LSPKWY,"This set is well worth the money.  Very clear instruction that follows a simple, logical progression.  You don't have to me an expereinced martial artist to follow this set.  The production quality was good, I feel that this would be of value to anyone who wants to carry a walking stick or cane for self defense, whether they're a practising martial artist or someone who needs a cane for mobility.",1356480000,12,399,4.671428571428572

4830186,5,B005LSPKWY,Fantastic video by Kelly Worden on the use of the cane for self defense.  It is really a useful training series and he has a second set available through his personal website.  Thanks Kelly!,1468281600,,190,4.5588235294117645

4830190,2,B005LSPKWY,"This is a two-disk set, but only one of the DVDs would play. The 2nd disk would never open. Even for the first disk that opened, the video quality was mediocre at best. It is not a professional video product. In contrast, Michael Janich's video on cane defense techniques is more informative and professionally produced.",1456531200,6,320,4.836363636363636

4830193,4,B005LSPKWY,"I originally wanted this dvd for my elderly mom, but as I watched it, I saw that people of any age can learn some useful information from it. And you don't necessarily have to use a cane either, you can bust someone upside the head with whatever you can find. Good stuff. I would recommend it. This was received complimentary in exchange for an honest review.",1445472000,2,359,4.454545454545454
4830194,5,B005LSPKWY,"Received it in good condition, on time and both the videos played back without any issues. Love the fact they put chapter markers in it so you can bounce between training sequences. Years ago I studied Modern Arnis (Filipino Martial Arts) which is what really interested me about this video training. I was impressed how they took a cane and applied much of that art along with other application. It starts out with very basic sequences which makes it really easy to follow even for a beginner. Even if your are seasoned martial artist the flow sequences and techniques advances and is worth checking out and implement into your training sequences. I did receive the videos at no charge in exchange for an unbiased and honest review but I can honestly say it would have been worth purchasing it for full price. The instructor in the video did a great job. In addition, these techniques could be used with so many other tools even if a cane is not available. This type of training really levels the playing field against a larger more powerful aggressor. I would recommend this to anyone looking to learn how to protect themselves from beginner to advanced.",1431648000,7,1156,4.727722772277228
4830195,5,B005LSPKWY,"Disclaimer: I received a discount for an honest product review.

I have been interested in learning self defense using a cane for sometime.  Training and information included on the 2 DVDs is very good.  Like with any type of self-defense, it will take practice to become proficient but techniques and moves are easy to do.  It will benefit all ages and not just the elderly using canes.  The techniques can be used by hikers and anyone with access to a walking stick or pole.  The ability to defend yourself is critical these days and with restrictions being placed on knives and firearms, this may just save your life and those you love.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  It will definitely be put to good use by me!",1431561600,2,727,4.5813953488372094
4830196,4,B005LSPKWY,Some of the exercises used with the safety equipment was interesting.  Base movements would be apparent to those who have been in the martial arts for a while.  You will pickup a few pointers even then.,1428969600,2,202,4.583333333333333

4830200,4,B005LSPKWY,"Being retired military (Navy) I for some reason was selected for such duties as Shore Patrol and did a stint as a ride along for the Arned Forces Police and the information provided here was close to the classes I went through then. What is provided here proved itself to be very effective and workable. The only real rub I have is during the demonstrations, the older participant seems to be using a powder puff approach.... Strikes in my opinion are intended to ""snap"" into the opponent, not in the way that individual shows. As you train so you fight, and doing as was portrayed would only cause you to go down hard...",1424131200,15,621,4.504424778761062

8478511,3,B005LSPKWY,"As a 66 y/o male who hobbles around with a cane, I figured that there must be a system established for use of a cane as offense & defense for personal protection. A video of martial arts movements is certainly easier to understand than a book. But neither comes close to personal instruction. There are a few Dojos across the country that teach cane fighting & defense technique, as distinct from escrima and bow staff, but none in my area. With no  Sensei available for in person instruction,I settled for a video. this one is fairly basic and easy to follow. My only fear is getting in over my head on the street",1505779200,,614,4.433628318584071
