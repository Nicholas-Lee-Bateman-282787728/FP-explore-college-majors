8015952,4,B0001PCCBO,"Sang Kim is awesome.  This video is actually 2 videos (of a 4 video series) put together.

It provides excellent basic and foundational coverage of how to attack an opponent.

As a former competitor, I can admit that I had trouble initiating an attack or an attack sequence on my opponents and would often freeze up.  I simply did not know how to attack.

When I bought this (when it was on vhs), it completely changed my sparring game!

Great examples are shown with variety and simplicity.  Pay attention to the closed verses open stance coverage.

The examples are basic, intermediate, and advanced.  He gives a ton of attack options (there are some that you should clearly not use and some to be really cautious - because doing so will almost guarantee you a sturdy kick to the groin).  My advice is to keep it simple.

The second portion of the video covers target drills.  Again, these are great.  Dated, but great.  They're good for use in class or for personal training.  The best drills are the V drills (as I call them) where the target holders are positioned at a 90 degree angle toward the competitor - check it out.

The main down fall is that this video uses a ton of footage from Taekwondo Training in Korea.  There will be some major over-lapping.

Over all, very good video.",1313625600,4,1291,4.539130434782609
