3872166,5,B00288KOBC,My 2 year old grandson is stuck on this DVD.  He watches it as often as he can.  I have watched it a few time with him.  There are lots of trains in this DVD.  I find I can also use it to help him with his colors because there are trains of all colors.  Thomas hasn't been watched since he found this.,1250640000,3,301,3.7142857142857144

3872169,4,B00288KOBC,"My boys (5 and almost 4) absolutely love trains (more so than your average kid) and love this movie. We are on our second copy and it was worth every penny, but you really have to love trains to enjoy this movie. It is older, but very educational and teaches them a lot about being a train engineer and about real trains.",1315440000,,321,4.193548387096774
3872170,5,B00288KOBC,"This is the first Train DVD I purchased for my son. He is clearly into trains. I was surprised to see it was filmed in the Pacific NW mainly in Seattle.
My son was completely excited about this DVD and would watch it for quiet time. He talks about it non stop and tells me all about the monorail and the trolley. I am very glad I chose this DVD to start him off with. We have moved onto the Mighty Machine Series but still watch this one from time to time.",1303084800,2,456,3.967391304347826
3872171,1,B00288KOBC,"After reading reviews, I purchased this DVD for my three and a half year old.  It is not worth the money.  My son loves trains and was so bored with this video.  I even tried to sit and watch with him to explain things, but he was not interested.  Do not waste your money.",1298332800,,272,3.9814814814814814

3872175,5,B00288KOBC,"I purchased this DVD before taking my 22 month old son on his first airplane ride.  My husband and I were worried he wouldn't keep the headphones on during the plane ride.  But he did!  He loves trains and was so absorbed in watching the movie that he didn't really notice the headphones.  He didn't make a sound while watching the DVD.  Since getting home from vacation, he has watched it almost everyday.  He brings us the remote control and asks for the ""ain"" movie!!",1282089600,3,470,4.470588235294118

8355968,3,B00288KOBC,"This is a nice dvd for kids ( big and little), that love trains. Too much talking(interviewing) for my 2 year old grandson and not enough train action. Don't make the mistake I did, and purchase this dvd and the ""Train Crazy Kids"" dvd,
