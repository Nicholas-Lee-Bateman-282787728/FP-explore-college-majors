2910840,5,B000TXNDVG,"If you love the flow of dance, this trilogy will delight you. I originally saw these three films when they came out.  Since I speak Spanish and love the culture, I fell in love at first sight. The Spanish word ""duende"" refers to the state a flamenco dancer enters when the spirit of dance takes over.  I would suppose we could compare it to being in the zone.  These films are true to that spirit. There isn't a single false note.  If you want to understand the Spanish culture, these films are the perfect way to learn what the essence of the culture is all about.",1200700800,10,565,4.30188679245283
2910841,5,B000TXNDVG,"I saw these incredible movies when they first came out and never could find videos to buy or rent. So I was ecstatic when they were rereleased. When I found them on Amazon, not only are they authentic in quality - but cost 30% less than the nearest competitative venders.
This is my first time using Amazon, but I'll start my search here from now on. I was surprized by the availablity & variety of obscure titles  I haven't found anywhere else.
Also, ease of use at check-out and delivery were clear, easy and fast!",1200614400,5,516,4.431578947368421
2910842,5,B000TXNDVG,Over twenty years ago I saw Carmen on Bravo and tried to buy a VHS to pass on to my offspring.  Well I finally was able to enjoy the other offerings and share with my grandchildren. These Flamencos made for great evenings and I think it will the same for all who enjoy great  dancing and music.,1197590400,,294,4.140350877192983
2910843,5,B000TXNDVG,"Carlos Saura""s Trilogy the best flamenco movies ever. As a flamenco student i was overwhelm my heart was dancing too. Thank you for making it available in America, waiting for it for years. This is really too much. Every student and teachers should own it.",1196812800,3,256,4.711111111111111
2910844,5,B000TXNDVG,"Passionate, dramatic, riveting as Flamenco itself, the film is simply amazing. It is set on the immortal Bizet's music. The original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists, leading proponent of the Modern Flamenco style, Paco de Lucia who plays a musician with the same name.  Legendary Flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades co/wrote the script and choreographed this fabulous version of the celebrated Georges Bizet/Prosper Mrime novella/opera. He plays a main character Antonio, the famous dancer/choreographer who works on retelling the story of Carmen in the Flamenco style that combines dances with singing and rhythmic hand clapping and has a highly charged level of dynamics that appeals enormously to the viewers.

Brilliant and graceful Cristina Hoyos whose technical excellence matches the elegant artistry of her dancing shines in the supporting role. Hoyos had been the first dancer in Gades' company for twenty years (1968-1988) and she was the protagonist of three films  that Carlos Saura made of Gades' three great shows: ""Bodas de Sangre"" (1978), ""Carmen"" (1983) and ""El Amor Brujo"" (1985).  Gorgeous Laura del Sol is a young dancer named Carmen in whom Antony sees from the first sight another Carmen, who was immortalized by two Frenchmen, the writer  Prosper Mrime in his most famous novella written in 1846 that had inspired George Bizet's world famous Opra-Comique version from 1875.

As in the opera and in the novella, Carmen in Saura's film is desirable and deadly, the ultimate femme fatale who has to be free above anything else. She could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to  submission. There are some 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen, and as different as they are, they all have in common the only possible tragic end. Saura/Gades' film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly Spanish. I fell in love with it from the first time I saw it over twenty years ago and it is as special and beautiful today as it was back then. Highly recommended.",1196812800,29,2087,4.997118155619597
2910845,4,B000TXNDVG,"I knew nothing about flamenco, these movies, or Carlos Saura before I received this set for my birthday. Carmen took my breath away a number of levels. It's a wonderful depiction of a mixing of story and reality that occurs in the course of performance preparation. Transported me to a completely different world.",1193961600,6,313,4.9245283018867925
2910846,5,B000TXNDVG,"I've been looking for these to come to dvd for years. It's a fascinating and thrilling trilogy. The series starts with Blood Wedding, in which a filmed dance rehearsal draws the viewer into a compelling story. Carmen is a blend of reality and fantasy in which elements of the flamenco production spill over into the dancer's lives (or is it vice versa??). El Amor Brujo is a fully realized musical production, set entirely on a soundstage with lush colors, much like a 50s Hollywood musical. It's an interesting progression to consider and each of the films fantastic on their own terms.",1191369600,16,587,4.821782178217822
2910847,5,B000TXNDVG,"Saura's Carmen is a magnificent movie. It is about a flamenco troupe who is rehearsing a dance version of Carmen. The director and the lead dancer begin to act out the Carmen story in their personal lives. The famous opera songs come alive in a new way when performed in the classical folk style of Spain, as if we are outside a real cigarette factory listening to gypsy women dancing and making music and rhythm with their bodies spinning. The dance scenes have a fierce intensity that completely absorbs your attention like no other movie I have seen.

Blood Wedding and El Amor Brujo are more straightforward showcases of the most famous flamenco dancers in Spain doing what they do best - good movies, but without the high drama of Merimee's story and Bizet's tunes, the dancers are simply professionals at the height of their careers.",1190160000,22,839,4.7465753424657535

2910850,5,B000TXNDVG,"If you are a fan of flamenco dancing, or just of dancing, you will love these three movies. They are magnificent, especially the last title of the trilogy, ""El Amor Brujo"". It kept me spellbound, from beginning to end.",1275868800,2,218,4.615384615384615
2910851,5,B000TXNDVG,"Sin duda alguna una obra maestra de Carlos Saura! Ademas de la genialidad de las coreografias, el lenguaje cinematografico que Saura maneja nos lleva de la mano a perder contacto con la realidad y a undirnos en esa ficcion real que mantiene la creencia de que lo que vemos ne realidad esta sucediendo.

Escuchar a Rocio Jurado cantando Fuego Fatuo es estremecedor!",1268524800,,364,4.870967741935484
2910852,5,B000TXNDVG,"I can easily believe the dancers in the film are the best Flamenco dancers in the world.  This film provides a view of the Spanish culture and Flamenco art that American audiences seldom see, and the structure of the film is inovative and impressive.  I enjoyed the films enormously.  Thank you Mr. Carlos Saura and thank you to the wonderful dancing and singing cast.  Lawrence Lessner (...)",1267920000,,392,4.8059701492537314
2910853,5,B000TXNDVG,"I was delighted to find Saura's Carmen on DVD.  It's a must see for anyone who appreciates dance in any form or, for that matter, a good movie.  Carmen is by far the winner in this trilogy.  Watch it first.",1264982400,,206,4.1
2910854,5,B000TXNDVG,"The collaboration of Antonio Gades and Carlos Saura generated this unique and marvellous trilogy. I have watched these films over and over again since they were released. They continue to fascinate me and work on so many levels. They had been difficult to find, individually, until this wonderful DVD package was produced. Thank you.",1250812800,,333,5.185185185185185
2910855,5,B000TXNDVG,"I saw the last film in this trilogy, El Amour Brujo, in college back in 1986 nad have been attempting to find it ever since. After a few airings on a spanish channel, edited down and pumped full of commercials, my multiple viewings, home recorded vhs tape finally gave out. A new tape could be purchased from a few retail stores for about $85. Much a I love the movie, it was way too much to pay, and so , my search for a dvd version or affordable vhs version continued.
...and along came Criterion Collection Eclipse Series 6 release.
OH MY GOSH!!!!!!  HERE IT IS!!!! The movie I fell in love withwas not only remastered with a beautiful print, easier to read subtitles (the original subtitles were white and were often lost in the background of the movie,) but you also get the other two films as well. And they're really good too! This collection is perfect for anyone who loves dance, musicals, and foreign films. Over the years, I have introduced these films to family and friends, never have I come across anyone who has not enjoyed them. I was so excited over this release, I purchased copies for all three of my sisters for their birthday gifts. Go get your copy now!",1242345600,,1175,4.465116279069767
2910856,5,B000TXNDVG,"Carlos Saura is the quintessential master of capturing dance on film. His obvious love of the art form reaches its peak in ""Tango,"" but these films were the steps he needed to take to direct (what I think is) the most beautiful dance film to date. The art direction, camera work, dancers and performances in these three Flamenco films are extraodinary. Saura has also done the world a great favor by capturing Antonio Gades and Christina Hoyos in their prime and brought them the worldwide attention they deserved. Oddly enough, I was exposed to Saura's brilliance in Tokyo seeing ""Blood Wedding"" - in Spanish, with Japanese subtitles. It didn't matter, as ""words"" are merely that. It is the DANCE that speaks to the viewer. Rather than his films being a passive experience, the incredible ""voyueristic"" aspect that Saura allows the viewer is also a ""First."" We are watching dance being created, we are surrounded by it, immersed in it and it is all excitingly visceral. The unique abstract settings, rehearsal hall mirrors and ""no frills"" art direction frame what Saura wants us to see: The dance. Thanks to Criterion (the Highest Standard in Video/DVD releases) for creating these Film Dance masterpieces - and, at a bargain price! They are brilliant.",1232150400,,1253,4.9714285714285715
2910857,4,B000TXNDVG,"I first saw Carlos Saura's Boda de Sangre in college, and loved it as a Spanish literature student, analyzing and comparing it to its original written version by Lorca. Now that I'm teaching high school Spanish, I bought it and showed it to my students. Saura's choreography is so detailed and passionate that my students were able to piece together Federico Garcia Lorca's original story...without any background knowledge.
These works are beautiful and worthwhile for anyone to view: From lovers of flamenco and Lorca to those simply with an interest in Spanish culture.
I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because of some people's personal reaction to the lack of speaking and explanation during the dancing. For flamenco lovers, this is acceptable, but for others, it might be a bit disconcerting.",1231459200,3,805,5.06015037593985
2910858,5,B000TXNDVG,"This is the MOST amazing trilogy and if you even think you like flamenco dancing, it is a MUST HAVE. We had seen all the films previously and they are great. However, the quality is better on these DVD's. We watched the first one as a Netflix rental and when i went to Amazon.com i saw the trilogy. We have other Criterion re-releases and they are ALL worth a trip out of the way. Ever bored with the usual TV offerings? You can watch these over and over. Buy It! This is such a great trilogy I admit that this is the FIRST time I have ever bothered to write a review. (We can't make this stuff up folks.)",1228176000,,605,4.092436974789916
2910859,5,B000TXNDVG,I've been waiting for years for these films to come out on dvd and to have them packaged together is wonderful. I've seen all of them several times and now I'll be able to share them with friends. Excellent.,1227744000,,207,4.333333333333333
2910860,5,B000TXNDVG,Probably the greatest performances I have ever seen. The story and dancing is superb.  Though flamingo is best seen live...these films are the next best thing. I saw Carmen 1st and loved it from the beginning.  One cannot tell the difference from reality and performance. Blood Wedding reveals the quality and skill aquired over many long years to be able to dance as the troupe does. I have seen nothing to compare in my 62 years of life.,1226275200,4,439,4.615384615384615
2910861,5,B000TXNDVG,"From the consistent 5 star reviews, one can safely assume that there is something extraordinary about these Carlos Saura productions with Antonio Gades flamenco artist and choreographer. I often explore foreign films out of a sort of arm chair world traveler curiosity. Not all are worth writing about, but these certainly are. I was held spellbound with each passing dialogue, one could easily say ""libretto"", if by that one means a timeless story - one that never seems cliche or dated in any way.
You will also be spellbound by the music, the dancing, the acting, the emotive mood, gestures, facial expressions, body language. I honestly have rarely seen anything so flawlessly performed. This is one you will be proud to have in your collection. Indeed, I don't think your collection could be considered at all complete without it! What a marvel of direction and cinematography.

Year later: back to add screen shots to the images gallery ( takes me a couple of days to do these-but I wish to underscore the impeccable visual beauty, musical grandeur, consummate acting, and choreography-and the greatest love story you'll see in a long time.)
This should be on the list of films to study in any university course in cinema art. Often a professor will assign a couple of films to compare to his students. One which I mention here in passing as briefly as possible, is the recent production of King Kong. After enjoying Amor  brujo (the love sorcerer)
after not having watched it in a year, King Kong happened to come on TV that evening. There IS no comparison between these two films except to underscore that ""Amor Brujo"" is pure art; and the other is pure teen age swill. After the 'Running with the Brontasauruses, the attack of the T-Rexes, the attack of the 50 pound insects, and alligator sized leeches, and all the slobbering, the crunching of bones, and filth, stench and horror...it feels like this:...""well...I've had five cups of coffee, a quart of soda pop, a large box of raisinettes..can we ratchet up the adrenalin any more?""

...My God in Heaven, help me !"" New cell phones coming out boast of ""4G"", or fourth generation ( soon there will be a 5G and make you go out and buy the newer version, and keep the millions rolling in from your bank accounts to the phone moguls )-these phones emphasize 'for the deaf and hard of hearing""...well King Kong and movies like it are clearly for the emotionally dead, and ""Hard of Feeling"".
I suppose all that is fine for teenagers, who require massive doses of stimulation.

The rest of us search for tenderness, artistry, skill level, subtlety, literary qualities, etc. ""Amor Brujo"" is awash in all these fine qualities. And guess what?...it did not take a battalion of computer geeks, a billion dollars, and another battalion of spoiled rich kids with more money than life experience or intelligence of any description. ""Amor Brujo"" was done with , probably, NO one getting paid, no set change, all on one sound stage...albeit, with  every single participant exuding skill and talent from every pore. Most important of all...""we started with a good libretto""...a good script and a good score.
Enjoy the images I upload. For some reason, no matter how hard I try to arrange the images in sequence, the receiving end at amazon scrambles the order. But that's okay. You should still get a feel for the awesomeness of this powerful script and the talented players in it.",1223683200,,3426,4.819727891156463

2910864,5,B000TXNDVG,"My love of flamenco music was born when I heard Carlos Montaya playing when I was about 25 years old.  I am now 73 years old and when I hear flamenco it is through my heart not my ears, I watched this dvd Eclipse Series 6 Carlos Saura's Flamenco on my 107 "" plasm tv, it was breathtaking, such brilliance and beauty, watching it over and over again  it moves me every time.",1208822400,,373,4.095890410958904

I am always reminded of The Ruling Class when I see this film, as it has the same unusual blending of alternate worlds mediated by music. With respect to Bizet, the film is, for me, much more compelling than opera. A very special achievement that should have a much larger audience.",1449532800,,351,4.5

8211243,5,B000TXNDVG,"Antonio Gades (1936-2004) was among Spain's greatest Flaminco stars, and in the 1980s he teamed with filmmaker Carlos Saura to create a series of films that translated well-known stories into a series of Flaminco ballets.

The first of these, BLOOD WEDDING, is based on the 1932 play by Lorca. The film begins as a documentary, with the arrival of Gades and his dance company in a dance space where they plan to rehearse. The rehearsal gradually gives way to a meticulously rendered performance. The story of a faithless bride (Cirstina Hoyes) who abandons her newly wed husband (Juan Antonio Jimenez) for a secret lover (Gades.)

The 1983 CARMEN is based on the 1875 opera by George Bizet and the original story by Prosper Merimee. The title character is a beautiful but shallow and promiscuous woman (Laura del Sol) who discards lover after lover. When she attempts to discard Jose (Gades), who has sacrificed much for her and genuinely loves her, he goes into a jealous rage and stabs her to death. As in BLOOD WEDDING, the film appears to begin as a documentary about the dance company as they rehearse CARMEN--but as it progresses the lives of the dancers begin to mirror the characters they play. The mixture of drama and dance is uneven, and although she is beautiful and an exceptional dancer, Laura del Sol seems to lack the fire required of the title character.

The 1986 EL AMOR BRUJO is based on a 1915 musical composition by Manuel de Falla. Although it does not begin as a documentary, it is distinctly theatrical, and opens with the audience being shown that the ballet will be performed in a found space with sets made of found materials. The story concerns Candella (Cristina Hoyos), who marries Jose (Juan Antonio Jimenez), who is having a secret affair with Lucia (Laura del Sol.) Jose is killed defending Lucia, and his friend Carmelo (Gades) is wrongfully imprisoned. When Carmelo returns years later, he finds that Candella, who he loves, is under the spell of Jose's ghost. He conspires with Candella to satisfy Jose's ghost with Lucia's love, thus freeing Candella to love Carmelo. Cristina Hoyos is remarkably fine here, and the lovely Laura del Sol is more suited to the role of Lucia than to her previous Carmen.

The dance is brilliant, passionate, impressive--but I found the mixture of dance, dumb show, and dramatic scenes in CARMEN and EL AMOR BRUJO a little uneven. This is particularly true of CARMEN, for which del Sol seems unsuited. Even so, the artistry of all three films is undeniable. Strongly recommended.

Carlos Saura intertwines the classic Carmen saga with the personal lives of his flamenco stars: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos, and Laura del Sol.  I also would recommend ""Blood Weddiing"" because it begins with the cast arriving backstage, setting up their dressing tables, and a brief parsonal narrative by Mr. Gades.  The third video, ""El Amor Brujo"" doesn't disappoint either.  It too features superb dancing, and a look into the Spanish gypsy culture.  I would highly recommend this Criterion Collection, which is getting harder to find.

Some years ago I ordered a copy of El Amor Brujo directly from Spain because it wasn't available in the US then.  That disk was not region-coded, but was in the European video format, which meant North American video gear couldn't play it but US computers could.  So my wife and I could only see it on our computers.  Now finally these films are available in USA video format so we can view them on our main video system.

The flamenco dancing in these films is superb and very very sensual.  And the acting is just as great.  Expressions and gestures would convey most of the story even without the subtitles.",1326585600,,706,4.303030303030303
8211247,5,B000TXNDVG,"Finally these films are available on DVD outside Europe. I have been looking for these films since the first moment I saw them. Carlos Saura is hands down one of the best directors of dance on film. He understands how to capture a good story and weave dance through it without disturbing the flow of the narrative. Antonio Gades and Christina Hoyos are the Fred and Ginger of the flamenco world. I am sad Antonio Gades is no longer around but Christina continues his presence and still burns a brilliant path of her own on stage and in film. Even if dance on film may make you run for the hills I recommend at least letting this get under your skin.
