4893915,5,B005UKFGWW,"IN MY SLEEP is one of those rare movies that make you realize why indies still have the edge over their studio counterparts.  This film has a wonderfully complex storyline, harkening back to the golden age of Alfred Hitchcock.  It is a wonderful puzzle box that becomes move fun with each layer that is unraveled.  These days with so many films playing it safe with cookie-cutter plots, this film gleefully ""breaks the rules"" with a wholly original plot that will surprise you as you try to put all of the pieces together.

In this film, the protagonist must follow the clues and unravel the mystery as to who murdered one of his best friends, even though the signs point to the bizarre conclusion that he may have killed her while he was sleepwalking.

The twists and turns will keep you guessing.  What a fun film.  I wholeheartedly recommend this indie-gem to all fans of thrillers and murder mysteries alike!",1318982400,4,912,4.69811320754717
4893916,5,B005UKFGWW,"When i go to the movies, i don't usually pick a thriller. However, i heard some different feedback that this one had a different feel from other thrillers from a friendi decided to check it out. I really enjoyed the way it kept my interest until the end, and kept me engaged with the character. At some point i need to re-watch it so i can make the connections about the sleep disorder earlier on. Lacey Chabert from Party of 5 (loved that show  back in the day) makes an appearance too!",1318982400,,487,4.293478260869565

The story plays out in an unpredictable and wonderfully spooky, which will keep you on your toes.  In many ways this movie reminded me of a new age thriller that is reminiscent of the classics from master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock. Truly a great new film from Director/Writer Allen Wolf that I highly recommend for all viewers!",1318809600,9,448,4.6
4893919,5,B005UKFGWW,"I rarely rave about movies, but without exaggeration it's truly one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.

The movie is a well-written edge-of-your-seat thriller, interlaced with incredible suspense, Hitchcockian elements, a fantastic plot, great intensity, wonderful musical score, and even humor along the way.

If you like movies like Memento and the Usual Suspects, and appreciate movies with twists and turns that keep you guessing the entire time, you'll love this movie. After I saw this movie, I couldn't stop talking or thinking about it. It's one of those movies that stays in your mind and makes you think through it and ask questions about it for several days. (And one that you'll want to see again once you figure everything out).",1318809600,4,756,4.94488188976378
4893920,4,B005UKFGWW,Lacey was again very good and she showed a different side to her acting career. She's good at showing human emotion in just about any way known to women.,1395532800,,153,4.310344827586207
4893921,5,B005UKFGWW,"I loved In My Sleep.  I read the script when Philip was rehearsing and found it to be quite intriguing.  It was fun to see it on screen and of course to see Philip who I consider to be ""The son I never had"" ever since he was in my Third Grade Class.  Miss Iverson",1376006400,,263,3.7454545454545456
4893922,5,B005UKFGWW,"I've been watching too many disappointing films lately so it's good to see a quality one crop up from time to time.

In My Sleep is a murder/mystery with a twist- the man (played by Philip Winchester) apparently committing the murders does so while sleepwalking.  However the question running through 80% of the movie is this- is he *really* killing people in his sleep, or is he being set up using several carefully placed tricks?  He wakes up surrounded by unxplainable blood spots that don't belong to him but, it's definitely somebody's blood.  Does that mean he's guilty?  Does that mean he's a murderer?  This makes for a compelling story.

What makes the story even MORE interesting is that the person murdered just happens to be his brothers wife after Philip and said wife actually have an affair together.  Philip wakes up in the morning with no recollection of the events that occurred over the night.  While this may sound like a typical guy thing (""I don't remember sleeping with her!"") there's more do it than that, haha.  Yes, *very* good idea for a storyline!  Amazingly, Philip being responsible for the murder is something he brings on himself due to nobody believing the severity of his sleepwalking issues.

Throughout the film Philip's character constantly tries to figure out what actually happened that fateful night and put the clues together involving several women he meets (a photographer played by Lacey Chabert, a woman he meets during special meetings with a gathering of people (Abigail Spencer) and his mother (Beth Grant) to name a few).  Other big name actors and actresses such as Tony Hale from Arrested Development and Kirsten Vangsness from Criminal Minds aren't really utilized much, which is a shame.  Well let's just say, the storyline gets more involved and interesting as it rolls along as Philip appears to be well on his way of being guilty.

I really can't say a whole lot more pertaining to the storyline since, you know, I'd only end up spoiling it and that's the LAST thing you're supposed to do with a film like this.  My only complaint is that there's a bit of confusion near the end involving Philip's sleepwalking that puts into question if he really *is* going around doing horrible things while sleepwalking or just pretending.  A segment involving Philip's father brings this aspect of the plot into serious question.  It was never officially stated so we're left to just assume or guess.

Otherwise, I have nothing but good things to say about it.  In My Sleep begins on a less than spectacular note that makes you think it's going to be a low budget flick, but that's only because it's warming up for the plot to get underway.  Highly recommended.",1372723200,,2705,4.8242950108459866
4893923,4,B005UKFGWW,"Good acting, a reasonably intricate plot, and even a nice musical score make this low budgeter worth watching. A very attractive cast featuring Phillip Winchester who has gone on to other starring vehicles on Cable give this a kind of slickness in a good way that some low budgeters can't achieve. Very much recommended.",1368403200,,320,4.944444444444445
4893924,4,B005UKFGWW,"Over all I enjoyed the movie. It made me second guess myself a couple times. I like that.

The acting was well done with the exception of the female detective. It felt like this actress was trying too hard, and the bit with the nuts was just that...nuts. The only thing it lent to the character was an even deeper lack of believability

I also didn't understand the point of the father. That part just felt like filler. The movie would have worked without it.",1368057600,,459,4.3882352941176475
4893925,5,B005UKFGWW,I liked this movie for the mystery through it. The actor Philip Winchester is a very good actor in my opinion.  I first saw him on Strike Back.,1364083200,,143,4.107142857142857
4893926,5,B005UKFGWW,"Loved this film! Shame I couldn't buy it in UK as cost me alot more than usual but as a fan of PW, it was worth it!",1353888000,,115,3.2962962962962963
4893927,4,B005UKFGWW,"Great movie, left us in suspense never saw last 10 minutes movie froze up! Called amazon several times to clear up or find out why it did that, they coulnt figure it out, but refund us",1346889600,,184,4.138888888888889
4893928,4,B005UKFGWW,"Allen Wolf makes a fairly impressive writing/directing debut with this tense little thriller. Though there are many aspects of the film that seem like it is a very low budget, quickly produced little grade B movie, the presence of Philip Winchester makes it work. Not only is this actor first class eye candy, he holds a character well and makes us believe a rather implausible plot.

Marcus (Philip Winchester) suffers from parasomnia (a category of sleep disorders that involves abnormal and unnatural movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, and dreams that occur while falling asleep, sleeping, between sleep stages, or during arousal from sleep. Most parasomnias are dissociated sleep states which are partial arousals during the transitions between wakefulness and NREM sleep, or wakefulness and REM sleep). He awakens with blood stained hands and when he hears that a close friend Ann (Kelly Overton) has been murdered he fears the worst. His best friend tries to be supportive but the police disrupt Marcus' own investigation of his behavior patterns when they come to arrest him for the murder. How the story ends is wracked with suspense and keeps the audience in suspense to the last minute.

The supporting cast is spotty, but Lacey Chabert, Abigail Spencer and even Kirsten Vangsness from The Mentalist television series give solid support.  This is not a great movie but it is a chance to watch Philip Winchester grow beyond his previous roles and become a solid leading man.  Grady Harp, March 12",1331942400,,1515,5.146341463414634
4893929,1,B005UKFGWW,Don't waste your money- this movie was terrible!! I saw this through Netflix and was extremely disappointed. I couldn't watch it more than the first 20 minutes. Acting was ok- but the writing is terrible and it looks like a student film. If you like Philip Winchester- watch Crusoe instead!!,1328832000,,291,4.84
4893930,5,B005UKFGWW,"It seems that nobody really knows what's going on. Can anyone help our main character figure out what he's done...or hasn't, in time to save someone else from becoming the next accident?

I found the pace of the film was just right. The mix of some deeper questions that come to mind give it a sublayer that separates this from a more often seen shallow who done it, slasher mystery. The main character is just as lost and at odds to understand what's going on as the viewer.

Fun and suspenseful at the same time. Glad that the writer/director finally got the chance to make his movie after 5 years. Congrats to him. Would recommend this to others.",1327190400,,649,4.491525423728813
4893931,4,B005UKFGWW,"A man wakes up covered in blood. He fears he might be doing terrible things while he's sleepwalking. The viewer is kept guessing what's happening here - right along with the sleep-disturbed protagonist of this fairly interesting mystery.

There are some good extras on the DVD, including Director/Writer Allen Wolf's commentary. Wolfe tells a lot about his intentions making this first full-length feature film of his career. He repeatedly points out how important he felt it was to maintain a blue, subtly maritime color scheme throughout the film. He believed this suggested the God's-eye view he was trying to establish for the action, with the enfolding, religious overtones that go with such a perspective. All this emphasis on having the main characters appear - now in a blue shirt - now with a blue tie - gets a little boring and beside the point. I think the average viewer will feel Wolf need hardly have bothered with such pointless details. But Wolf is such an engaging, chatty narrator, that you'll probably want to stick with his commentary anyway.

But do be sure to view the movie through without the commentary first. Wolf reveals every detail about the solution to the mystery very early in his commentary. If you play the DVD with his audio first, you'll immediately ruin the suspense.

The DVD also includes a gag reel and a ""Making Of"" feature. These extras include you as part of the ""family"" atmosphere that Wolfe said developed in the course of shooting.",1324857600,,1478,4.8804780876494025
4893932,2,B005UKFGWW,"Why so many reviewers said ""edge of your seat"" might suggest they all have connections to the same paid reviewer or they all have really small seats. And Hitchcock comparable, please, not even close. As far as acting it was typical TV acting which is what the cast's collective filmography credits amount to. The storyline about the human fear of losing control combined with our fear of the night has good storytelling potential but this story had too many improbable coincidences, one after another, to elicit nothing more than a ""sure"" reaction. A well repeated plot of everything pointing to the sleepwalker as the murdering police suspect when we know it's the wife's husband (and sleepwalker's close friend) who will ultimately be found out. Then there's the dead wife's long lost sister suddenly showing up and developing a relationship with the sleepwalking suspect. Add the frequent break ends with knife/blood plants in the sleepwalker's apartment; the unlocking of handcuffs while he's asleep all by the husband killer. The eventual meeting of the husband tries another knife plant on his long time buddy to make him think he's killed again was not believable. Really, how many times can the same routine be used on someone? In the final scene, as the police conveniently arrive during the anticlimactic struggle between the two guys, the husband kills himself with the same knife that he used to kill his wife.",1324684800,,1422,5.029661016949152
4893933,5,B005UKFGWW,"I've been waiting for this movie since I heard about it several years ago and it was well worth the wait!  I jumped a couple of times and never did I think the ending would be as it was.  The pace of the film was perfect and I never found myself zoning out as I do with some movies.  Philip Winchester gave a wonderful performance as Marcus.  Hopefully, Allen Wolf has more projects in the works to delight audiences with.  He managed to put out a suspenseful movie that is definitely one of my favorites.",1323561600,,505,4.273684210526316
4893934,5,B005UKFGWW,"I am a huge Hitchcock fan, and his movies I enjoyed most were the taut psychological suspense films of his middle period, where you were constantly guessing throughout the film and revising your opinion until virtually the last moment, and then when you left the theater you were still pondering the themes that had been explored along the way.  Allen Wolf has managed to recapture this spirit perfectly in his new independent film.  Solid acting by Philip Winchester in the lead role and from the supporting cast as well makes the storyline engrossing and the characters believable.  If you enjoy psychological drama, cerebral thrillers, or haunting suspense, then this film will surely reward.",1320451200,3,695,5.132743362831858
4893935,4,B005UKFGWW,This story has so many twists and turns you have to pay close attention to the fine writing and direction by Allen Wolf.  His cast is as strong as his plot.  This kind of smart movie doesn't come along very often.  See it.,1320364800,,222,4.116279069767442
4893936,5,B005UKFGWW,It is a well-told story that is suspenseful.  With all the twists and turns I couldn't guess the outcome.  Definitely an unpredictable and entertaining story.,1319587200,,158,5.28

4893938,5,B005UKFGWW,"I heard about this movie from friends a few years ago and have been excited for its release ever since.  Wolf gets some big name actors and actresses to carve out a story laced with the frustration, intensity, confusion, sensuality, and  redemption.  The story pushes you to well-executed cinematic shots with the beat of gifted musicians.  It's best at the theater and I can't wait to see it on my home theater.",1319414400,,412,4.680555555555555
4893939,5,B005UKFGWW,"This is a ""must see"" movie.  It's entertaining, has twists, humor and even a thoughtful message that stays with you.  It appeals to a wide range of ages and personality types.  You will enjoy it.",1319155200,,195,4.514285714285714
4893940,5,B005UKFGWW,"This is a must see movie!  When I first saw the trailer, I was intrigued.  I loved the concept of someone having another life after they go to sleep at night.  When I finally saw the movie, I really loved what they did with the storyline.  The main character's sleepwalking is real but also a metaphor for his life - his life is out of his control.  A series of events happen that ""wakes"" him up to the consequences of some of the choices he has made.  I was on the edge of my seat while watching it but I also liked how it had many thoughtful moments and good chemistry between the characters.  I look forward to owning a copy.",1319068800,,628,4.140495867768595
4893941,5,B005UKFGWW,"What a fabulous thriller!  My wife and I are 55, and we were so impressed with In My Sleep that we took a couple 25 year old friends to see it.  All aspects of the film were so well done, but for us the real test was to see it through the eyes of our young friends.  They absolutely loved it.  Great to see this kind of entertainment with a solid take-away to think about.",1319068800,,372,3.92
4893942,5,B005UKFGWW,"I loved this movie!  I thought it would be violent because of the poster, but instead it was suspenseful and clever with plenty of twists and turns:  Hitchkock-esque.  It has funny moments as well.  I jumped in my seat several times; the ending was a big surprise.  There were many layers to the story, reminding me of ""The Usual Suspects.""  Overall it was a refreshing intellectual experience.  I like movies that have substance and was glad that this movie had a thoughtful center while being a big thrill ride.  Philip Winchester was very convincing and Lacey Chabert was great too.  I definitely recommend it!",1319068800,,613,4.8173076923076925

4893944,5,B005UKFGWW,"I had the advantage of seeing a special, early theater screening in Minneapolis at which Allen Wolf and David Austin answered questions after the show.  They did a great job with the movie and were a lot of fun with their comments - a rare treat!  No, I did not guess the ending, nor will most of you.  I might add that I was a little worried about the theme including violence and... - well, let's not give it away, but I went with a group of friends (some with a low tolerance for unnecessary or extreme violence) and the main comments at dinner afterward were: ""I always figure out the plot, but they got me this time - it sure kept me guessing.""  ""Great movie - they handled it really well."" and ""When does a DVD come out?""",1319068800,2,727,4.2086330935251794

Don't waste your time on this sappy thing. Winchester says his lines as though he can't stand being there at all. Why he agreed to star in something that utterly stifles all his talents was the only thing mysterious to me about this supposed mystery film. It's a flop in every way possible, and that's being generous. The reason I didn't give it the one star it really deserves is because I respect Phillip Winchester.
