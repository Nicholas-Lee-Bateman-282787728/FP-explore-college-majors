8261966,5,B0016AKSN2,"Martyr is, unfortunately, relatively obscure in that they hail from NE Canada and don't seem to get out much.  I've been a huge fan ever since I was blown away by the brilliance of Warp Zone, and was further staggered by the next-level baddassery of Feeding the Abscess.  It really is a damn shame that they never seem to leave their neighborhood.

If you are unfamiliar with these guys, the only way I can think to describe them is a mixture of Death + Meshuggah + Taking it to the Next Level.  Harsh vocals, yes.  Amazing and mind-blowing riffs that only get more interesting and astounding the more you listen, with complex bass lines that complement them beautifully and yet still do their own thing.  And finally the drumming.  I can honestly say that Patrice has become my favorite metal drummer both in terms of sheer skill and ""are you kidding me"" creativity.  So clearly, I like Martyr.

I've never had the chance to see Martyr play live, so when I heard about this DVD I was really excited to check it out, and to say I was not disappointed is an understatement.  This is a top-notch concert DVD, and I'm not just talking about the amazing ease in which they seem to be able to play some of the most complex music I've ever heard live, but the production and clarity really does it justice.  This DVD captures the band tearing through some of their best material.  The camera work is outstanding, with a fair amount of screen time spent on the right members of the band and the right time, and like I said, the musicianship has to be seen and heard to be believed.

Aside from the live concert, there are some really great extras that capture the band in the process of writing, rehearsing, and recording the album ""Feeding the Abscess"".  A great value-add, but ultimately, this DVD is the next best thing to seeing Martyr play live.

I simply cannot recommend this DVD enough.  If you are a fan of technical metal and you haven't heard these guys before, this is a great way to be introduced.  You will not be disappointed.",1301184000,2,2034,4.498637602179836
8261967,5,B0016AKSN2,"Buy this thing right now! Martyr is a mix of death, thrash and prog metal which rocks big time on stage. You bet these guys know how to play! Actually, Daniel Mongrain (guitars & vocals) is a well-known shredder and a highly-rated session guitarist in the Quebecker musical scene. Equally, all the other guys in the band are first-class players; so rest assured this is a top-notch show which will offer a total shredfest and a high-octane neck-wreckage to the most demanding metalhead.

In addition, you might think the sound and the image on this DVD are not so good, being Martyr an ""obscure"" band from the ""unknown"" city of Trois Rivieres and signed to a ""minor"" label -- Galy Records, from Montreal. Ok... well... if you did, YOU ARE WRONG! The production of this DVD is actually way better than almost anything I've listened to in my life. In fact, many releases from well-known bands with huge budgets would pale in front of this little jewel, believe me. You'll get a bunch of songs (15 live songs, plus five other songs recorded with a lower budget), plus a documentary and other little goodies, all edited in a pristine way by absolutely amazing professionals. What else do you want?

And well, a special mention goes to the sound, which is mixed and mastered by the skillful engineer Pierre Remillard. The audio on this DVD is crystal clear and powerful. I can't stop listening to this: great musicianship + awesome attitude + great production = a great metal release that no one should overlook!

Sadly, not too many people know who these ""Martyr"" guys are. So men, if you like true metal and read this review, please do yourself a favor and purchase this DVD. You'll support a band of hard-working musicians, but I also guarantee you you'll be rewarded with almost two hours of rocking pleasure. In few words, this is one of the best live DVD's I've ever owned and I'd recommended it to any metal fan. Go for it with no fear. If you don't know Martyr, you are missing something really big!

So, five shiny, raw-but-perfectly-crafted stars. Rock on!",1217980800,4,2061,4.685082872928176
