3650005,2,B001IXXY74,"There have been other documentaries about facial expressions and body language.  However, this one tries to make things ""sexy"" by focusing on politicians and celebrities.  This work is a little bit PBS, a little bit C-Span, and a little bit E! Cable Network.

Some stuff I found informative or true.  They compared a sunny, extroverted Britney Spears at the start of her career to a sunglassed, limo-catching misanthrope of recent years.  This work reminded me of ""The Negotiator"" when Samuel L. Jackson's character tells another man, ""Your eyes went up because you are trying to tap into a lie in your brain.""  The work made an interesting point about where President Clinton and where he was pointing when he declared, ""I did not get busy with THAT woman!""

Still, other stuff didn't jibe with me.  They showed how Arafat and an Israeli president didn't want to go into a room first.  They said this was cultural and I agree.  It had nothing to do with innate, genetically inscribed body language.  Later they said Nixon had his hands behind his back when speaking to the press because he wanted to look open but coax himself without others seeing it.  Okay, maybe.  However, I could read his hidden hands as signifying that he had something to hide.  It could be that he was trying to pretend to present the truth when he knew the lie was not visible to those in front of him.  The work showed a car salesman standing up and talking to two potential buyers in a car and they say, ""He messed up!  He should have spoken to them at their level.""  However, this was an older man communicating to two young ladies.  Perhaps the experts weren't reading gender and age-based customs into his actions.

This just felt like a time-killer, rather than true and hard reporting.",1233705600,12,1769,4.666666666666667

3650007,4,B001IXXY74,Pretty lengthy but it has some really good points. I use excerpts for an effective presentations course.,1408838400,,104,5.176470588235294

3650009,4,B001IXXY74,"First blush looks and sounds good.  This is the proverbial ""how to eat an elephant"" and each bite is going to require an investment re-watching a particular part of the DVD and then spending time on that segment in everyday life.  The time spent will prove worthwhile over time.  This DVD is like a shiny new toolbox.  It's going to take some wrench time before you'll consider yourself a mechanic.",1402617600,,398,4.642857142857143
3650010,5,B001IXXY74,This is an excellent film. Really explains body language with real life demonstrations from people we all know! There is so much information they present that I have watched it multiple times and I keep learning from it. Great especially for future law enforcement people and other forensic occupations.,1398297600,,303,5.204081632653061

3650012,4,B001IXXY74,Interesting to get ideas why body language is important in the communication. How to be comfortable with yourself and what are you telling people without words.,1386892800,,160,5.1923076923076925
3650013,5,B001IXXY74,"This video, with recent real world examples, is a great one to show students before working on presenting major speeches.  The discussion of non-verbal communication throughout is fascinating and one your students are sure to love.",1381190400,,231,5.416666666666667
3650014,5,B001IXXY74,"Behavioral analysis is very important in every aspect of life. This DVD helped me to continue studying body language in order to be successful. The scenes involving political figures helped with strategics on voting, business, economics, and social response. Know that body language needs to be monitored constantly based on issues, state of mind, country, and status. This DVD along with Secrets of the Mind can show different aspects of human behavior.",1377993600,,454,5.319444444444445
3650015,5,B001IXXY74,"watch it twice, The first time just enjoy it the second time, pay closer attention, a real eye opener. very informative.",1371513600,,120,4.761904761904762
3650016,2,B001IXXY74,I am really interested in Psychology and have been reading quite a bit about communication but am now trying to understand body language and was hoping to get some insights into normal day to day interactions but this supplied little instruction in that area.  I really didn't need to watch a video telling me that when Britney Speers shaved her head and hid from the media that her body language was telling everyone something was wrong.  Or that when Richard Nixon sweated during the presidential debate with John Kenndey that he was under pressure.  Or that Hilary Clinton has been coached and when she pointed to people in the audience it was all for effect.  This video hat some slight entertainment value but I really didn't learn much about body language.,1369094400,2,762,4.793893129770993
3650017,3,B001IXXY74,"Had to amend this. On occasion, I have had enough time to run parts of this video and most middle school student were either fascinated or at least interested. I had to stop and start and skip some issues and language but the presidents' segment was great fun for them. Too long a video in one stretch, but edited, it is a good supplement to public speaking.

>Maybe I didn't read the description closely enough before ordering, but this just seems like a number of long vignettes strung together loosely. Lots of footage of famous people giving away their attitude in actions, or different culture's hidden clues, but not what I thought it would be (an instructional tool organized into sections with tips for how to avoid these goofs as well).",1358294400,4,745,4.687022900763359
3650018,5,B001IXXY74,The secrets of body language was well done. It will teach you about human body language I know I have been studying this subject for 40 years. I am a psychologist and knowing what people are saying with out using words helps me understand the person and what their needs are. Often the two don't match and I know body language is more truthful than the spoken language. I recommend this DVD to anyone working with people.,1352073600,2,421,4.48051948051948
3650019,3,B001IXXY74,"A colleague in the communication field had recommended this video, so I had high hopes for the content. Although there are some interesting, historic clips, and coverage of a few scientific experiments, the coverage is a bit ""lite"". There are a few too many ""experts"" analyzing footage of famous liars, implying that nonverbal communication is actually a language that can be accurately and professionally decoded. Most professionals recognize that nonverbal communication is highly ambiguous, and this viewpoint was not really detailed here. That said, I did find a few clips worth showing in my communication courses.",1347667200,5,619,5.458333333333333
3650020,5,B001IXXY74,I teach high school speech and a coworker suggested this dvd.  It really did a great job explaining nonverbals and the icons and pop culture connections to todays youth made it interesting to the students.  I highly recommend this dvd!,1347408000,2,235,4.85
3650021,2,B001IXXY74,"This DVD does a poor job communicating how to effectively learn body language. More than half the video uses examples of politician's and celebrities.  And then the body language 'experts' start explaining how they can tell that Clinton was lying about Lewinsky, or that Jolie was hiding her affair with Pitt. The big problem is, they 'predict' the body language after they knew the outcome.
Well, i can predict yesterday's lottery winner too.  But i can't predict tomorrow's. I expected this video to prove
that body language reading can predict the behavior of others. But it doesn't.
A much better video would show every day people in stores, airports, and other public places, and then say
""The camera will show that the people who's body expresses itself in a specific fashion will perform a specific act 90% of the time.
We will show ALL the people who exhibit the body language behavior, and then we'll see if their actions after the behavior are predictable.""
This video has nothing like that.

It's the equivalent of someone saying they could ""predict"" that Google stock would skyrocket, after it's skyrocketed.
Predictions are only useful in predicting an outcome before it happens.
It's just senseless quacking to 'predict' an outcome after it's occurred.
(For further info, read ""Falsifiability"" on Wikipedia).

One very important point. Body Language is not 100% accurate. You can have 5 body language experts and each one will give a different opinion on what the person being analyzed is communicating with their body.  But, it does make one person pay more attention to the person they are talking to, and that's a good thing.
You're better off reading ""What every'Body' is saying"" by the ex FBI agent. He has better info.",1343088000,8,1738,4.979310344827586
3650022,5,B001IXXY74,"Don't you LOVE the kind of information that makes you sit up, look at each other and say, ""WOW, that's INTERESTING""?  This DVD is SO informative!  You will not be a Body Language expert after watching this, but you WILL be informed of almost every kind of non-verbal means of communication we let slip from how we walk, shake hands, gesture with our eyebrows, stand next to someone ... and the list goes on.  We learned that 93% of all communication is NON-VERBAL, so it is pretty important to know what to look out for in a potential spouse, employee or political representative!

This is so fascinating that we were simply absorbing the surprising non-verbal communicators...we are going to watch it again to really listen to all of the specifics.  The DVD used famous suspects as they were being interviewed before we knew they were lying so we could see how they silently gave away their lies.  We were shown how political candidates are actually coached on how to appear more ""attractive"" to voters.  We highly, enthusiastically recommend this DVD!",1342742400,5,1053,4.816666666666666
3650023,3,B001IXXY74,90 percent of human communication is conveyed nonverbally. This doc gives you some facts which may come to be very useful.,1336694400,3,122,4.857142857142857

3650025,5,B001IXXY74,"Whether you are in law enforcement, politics or theatre, this DVD is fascinating. It is clear, authoritative and very well explained. For anyone who studies (or should study!) the art of non-verbal communication, this DVD is a gem.",1303171200,,231,5.105263157894737
3650026,5,B001IXXY74,"This documentary covered more than I expected and used real footage for everything. Looking around I note that the other reviewers fault it for not covering enough topics and for using clips of famous people and people who were on TV news -- but I think it covered plenty in an hour in a half for anybody new to the subject, and I thought it was great that it used TV footage of famous people and people like Susan Smith that were in the news, because they needed to use footage that showed actual real-world body language and facial expressions, rather than using actors, and TV news is an obvious place to go for such video. They got footage of lots of people in a variety of high-stakes situations, doing what people do in such situations, which is sometimes to try to fake expressions and body language and sometimes to be genuine. Since I am a beginner with this subject this was perfect and I give it 5 stars.",1295654400,16,915,4.420118343195266
3650027,3,B001IXXY74,"I have an avid interest in body language, especially as it relates to public speaking.  Because of this I have read several books on the subject.  I had high hopes that I would be able to recommend this video to those that I coach.  I thought that the the visual nature of a video would help them to grasp the importance of body language faster than a book could.  I had also hoped that the material would be presented in a professional manner.  Well, this DVD was O-K, but not what all that it could have been.

My first disappointment was with the ""experts"" chosen to dissect well know videos of political figures and other celebrities in order to illustrate certain body language principles.  I believe that almost all of them were ""body language consultants"".  People that make their living teaching a particular subject to individuals and corporations are not the most objective sources of information.  I had hoped for a different sort of professional, someone more detached and academic.  When the consultants viewed videos of past presidents and other important leaders caught in a presumed lie some of them almost giggled, so pleased that they could point out obvious ""tells"".

The video clips were entertaining but most of them seemed tired.  Yes, Nixon lied, Bill Clinton lied, show us something that we don't know.  The program started to become more interesting when they went car shopping.  Hidden cameras followed ""consumers"" looking to buy a car from two different dealers and examined the salesmen's body language. There were a couple of other practical, everyday illustrations of reading the type of body language that we encounter in our lives, but not as many as I had expected.  A highlight was the section on voice analysis.  Credentialed professionals explained the theories and principles behind their discipline.

For a television special this video was fine, but I suggest that you don't expect too much from it and rent it instead of purchasing it.  I doubt that I will be using my purchased copy very often.",1294704000,17,2035,4.900584795321637
3650028,4,B001IXXY74,"I have read many books on Body Language but i didn't help me a lot. Those are really goods such as ""Secrets of Body Language"" by Allan Pease. The reason is i didn't know practical applicability of those signs.

This DVD is a great one, they have taken Professionals to give review and all you have is a first hand information. The examples they use are famous personalities and made this show very interesting. The DVD goes on without boring.

The only downside is they cover only a niche segment, mostly Political leaders, Criminals. It would be more interesting if they would have taken business deal environment and Courtship signals, that would be more practically helpful for general public to decipher the hidden meaning and avoid day to day havocs.",1293667200,41,755,4.8
3650029,5,B001IXXY74,I picked this up for the classroom on reccomendation and can truely say it was an excellent choice.  The current examples of today's pop culture icons and their body language kept the students riveted and I heard animated discussion.  The narration had concise information and the interviews were interesting.  This is an excellent addition to any library on Body Language.  History Channel provides excellent videos...this is definately one of them.,1284249600,30,450,5.385714285714286
3650030,4,B001IXXY74,This video was very good but only explained about politicians not ordinary people.  Worth the money.,1273622400,3,100,5.25
3650031,1,B001IXXY74,"The self-styled experts in body language are very good at determining that Susan
Smith lied about not killing her children; that Nixon lied about not being a crook; that Lee Oswald lied when he said he knew nothing about the assassination of John Kennedy.  The list goes on and on.  Unfortunately the determinations in this DVD were all made long after the lies were public information.

Body language is hardly a science, any more than phrenology or the reading of tea leaves by a Gypsy fortune teller.  Not one item in this DVD would be admissable in court.  Can you imagine sending an accused to death for not wrinkling his forehead at the right time in his testimony--or folding his hands on his lap in some form of protection?

If people will actually buy into all this, I can give you a list of other nonsense they will believe.  Anyone for haruspex?  Etc.",1272931200,4,862,4.588235294117647
