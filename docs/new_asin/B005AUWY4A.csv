4642245,5,B005AUWY4A,As a family we absolutely love the Cars movies and having waited for the combined edition this is a great deal. But it comes in a horrible horrible horrible packaging. I would really recommend one buys a DVD/Blu-ray case holding multiple DVDs (especially if you are more after the content than the packaging!). Content: 5 stars. Packaging: 0 stars. My personal overall stars is 5 stars (as I am valuing the content much more!),1322438400,2,426,4.77027027027027
4642246,3,B005AUWY4A,"We're Disney fans, and already had Cars (1), but not the other two, so we opted for this set.  It's a bit of overkill, but we have extras for all the different devices.  Plus a couple of ""oops, the kids scratched the heck out of this disc somehow"" copies.

The kids enjoyed the movies.  Since they're the intended audience, I'm not going to review the scripts/movies.  I'm going to specifically talk about the packaging.

I'm all about reducing my plastic consumption.  But I do NOT like the storage box these are in.  I wish they had sleeves or something.  The foam block inside the box holds all the discs (the silver box with the checkerboard ""top"" to it.  The checkerboard thing is actuall a flap of fabric).  Anyway, this foam cheapens it.  And this was not a cheap set.  The foam has slits cut in in to store the disc.  I suppose they're supposed to be kept pristinely apart from each other, but when I opened the box, they were all rubbing against each other.  Also, the notches are all deformed, so it's not as if I can somehow ""fix"" it.  I can get every disc but one in the box without touching its neighboring discs.",1321142400,18,1126,4.393203883495145
4642247,3,B005AUWY4A,"I really enjoy the Cars movies and loved the idea of having them on blu-ray, DVD and a digital copy.  You get a lot for your money in the end but if I were to do it over I would have bought them separately just to have them in better cases. Once you get into the box you find out that they are stored in a little box with soft foam that is shaped to slide the discs in and out of.  It is not very user friendly, especially if you have little ones. The so called lid doesn't stay secure or really even fit for that matter. It is bulky and really a pain to try and fit it in with the other movies on the shelf. I say buy them separately and avoid the hassle of having to buy cases later.",1320969600,14,685,3.7832167832167833
4642248,3,B005AUWY4A,"We had pre-ordered this collection and were very excited to receive it.  It is a good price for the amount of movies (and playback options) that you receive.  However, it is still a lot of money, and for the price, I would have expected better, sturdier and more accessable packaging.  It is basically a flimsy cardboard square with foam in the bottom.  The slots cut into the foam do not even hold the movies properly.  It is difficult to see which movie you are looking for since it is dark in the box and removing the base to see the movies better is no easy task.  So, I would give 5 stars for the movies themselves (love all three!), but I can only give 3 stars for the poorly designed packaging.",1320278400,5,701,4.312977099236641
4642249,3,B005AUWY4A,"I picked up this set yesterday. I felt I paid a decent price for it when I compared it to buying the movies separately. I haven't actually watched any of the discs yet but I'm sure they'll be fine. I liked the first Cars and love Michael Caine so I'm looking forward to the sequel. Mater's Tall Tales should be cute as well, it was really just a bonus anyway, it was the other two that I wanted. What I was not happy with was the packaging. It looked nice enough in the store but upon getting home with it and opening it, its a super cheap way to package this 11 disc set. I assumed the cardboard would house some sort of container inside that would hold the discs. Nope. Once you open the box, there's a flimsy piece of packaging plastic that sits on top, it is in no way anchored or attached, of a piece of foam that has slits in it to hold the discs so that they don't rub against each other. That's it. No blu-ray cases or anything else. Wow, Disney, you would think with an $100 list price (I got it for $75, Best Buy had it for $80 plus I had a $5 off coupon) they could come up with something a little sturdier. Plus if you have kids and they want the car that's included, your going to have to tear open what packaging you do have to get it out and then how will your discs be kept? Really pretty disappointed here. I would have taken it back and bought the individual discs if not for the digital copies, I wanted them and you only get them for all three in this set. Bad form, Disney. Bad Form!",1320192000,33,1504,4.050335570469799
4642250,2,B005AUWY4A,"I will admit up front I have not picked this up yet and that it has not even come out yet.  Normally, I'm not a fan of reviews for things under those circumstances, but this release is so horrid, it deserves it.

It has to be said that while yes, this is possibly Pixar's weakest film made thus far, I'm not going to bash the film.  It is what it is, a film to capitalize on Matter, Lightning and the merchandise success from the original film.

The issue is this, Disney has already done some rather shady things to push really hard to get folks to stop buying DVD and start buying Blu-ray.  And from their perspective, why not?  They make way more money off of Blu-ray, and DVD sales are not what they once were.  The gravy train is over.  True, they could have let the transition from DVD to Blu-ray be a bit more natural, like it was from VHS to DVD, but Disney seemed to have a hard time waiting for that, so they decide to do things like release only the Blu-ray and then one to two months later, the DVD.  My favorite was probably how almost over night, the bonus features died on DVD and end up only on Blu-ray.  These things they hoped would help push consumers away from DVD and into Blu-ray.

Anyway why I'm mad and why I'm posting this is simple.  It seems that before Blu-ray has even fully conquered DVD, Disney has already found Blu-ray's ""replacement"" with Blu-ray 3D.  And, it would seem they are going to re-use the old bag of tricks to get folks to start going after Blu-ray 3D, or so I'm sure they hope.  For this film, they are going to release two shorts on the DVD and that is it, which is about how things have been for a few years.  However, starting with this film, the fun extras that are normally on the Blu-ray are being saved only for the Blu-ray 3D release!  That's right, the Blu-ray for ""Cars 2"" will be as bare bones as the DVD.

I think Disney has over played their hand this time.  I for once may be rather slow on picking this title up, if at all.  This practice is wrong and hopefully, once folks realize what they did, it will back fire on them.  This also the first non-2 disc Pixar Blu-ray in sometime.  Shame on Disney for a crappy effort.",1318291200,14,2181,4.219806763285024

4642445,5,B005AUWY4A,"One of the best thing about the Pixar movies is that they can watched over and over again without getting sick of them, which is a good thing when you have kids. Between this and the Toy Story box set, there are 5 really good movies to watch. Cars, Cars 2, and even Mater's Tall Tales are all very entertaining and will keep you and your kids watching for hours.

This box set is a nice idea, but falls a little flat. Once you open it up, there is no easy way to make the lid stay on (compared to the toy box with the Toy Story set), it just kind of sits there. Also, the movies were not in the foam slots correct either, which could have caused scratching (luckily did not though). However, I love the set and it even comes with a diecast car that you can't get anywhere else.

I gave this 5 stars because this is worth owning just for the movies alone, you can forgive some of the packaging problems and just watch Cars for the 15th time this week!!!",1327363200,2,952,4.112903225806452
4642446,4,B005AUWY4A,"I wanted to get both Cars and Cars 2 on Digital Copy, this was the only way at the time, unless I wanted to spend $20 a pop for them, this was the only Blu-ray package with Digital Copy.

Having never seen Cars 2, it was a surprise to me how complicated the storyline was.  It almost seem like Pixar introduced many more characters so they can sell more toys (I collect Cars diecast cars).

The biggest surprise was Mater's Tall Tales.  It's proven to be a short that's full of laughs.  I must have had that movie playing in the background over 20 times while I do my work.  Sure to make kids of all ages laugh.

The packaging is somewhat disappointing.  Not sure what the purpose was having this big, big box.  I'm sure they can design an accordion folder that takes up half the space this thing takes up.  While the exclusive diecast is nice, no one I know is going to take that out to play with.  It's basically a nice gold record that looks good on the wall but you can't play.

For movie lovers, I'm sure money is not a problem, but space is.  Now instead of this filed away with my other Blu-rays, I now have to have this (along with the Lion King set, and other e-normous sets) put away in my closet.

Bummer.",1326931200,,1216,4.185344827586207
4642447,1,B005AUWY4A,"Movies are great, extras are great.  As so many other reviewers say, the packaging is awful, awful, awful ... wish I had bought them individually instead.  As another reviewer mentioned, I will need to get some blank cases to put them in.  The case they shipped in is not safe for the disks, it is difficult to deal with and it does not fit on my shelf with my other DVD's.  Right now it sits in my closet.  The box is a pain in the neck everytime I want to get to the DVD's.  Disney should admit their mistake and offer us all replacement cases to properly store the disks.  Knowing that they won't, the only alternative we have is to continue to bash them about this, so maybe they will learn their lesson and not be so stupid in future DVD releases.  The movies are 5 stars, the packaging is a negative 4 stars... so it averages out to 1 star.  Avoid this release... or wait until the price continues to plummet (I see it's already tanked to about $50), buy it, throw out the box and get blank cases.  Look at the reviews and beware ... we've all been burned.",1325635200,3,1062,4.212871287128713
4642448,3,B005AUWY4A,"First, the movies are great and the addition of Cars Toons is nice.  However, for the price you would expect a much nicer packaging of the discs.

Overall, the set is very comprehensive including all of the possible disc options, including 3D and digital copies.  I love that Disney includes the regular DVDs so that we can use them in the car, on travel with the laptop or portable DVD player, or the kids can watch in their playroom.

So, in conclusion, if you do not own Cars 1 or 2 already and you are looking to add to your Disney collection, this is a good option.",1325376000,,570,4.299065420560748

8463675,1,B005AUWY4A,Buyer beware. Read the entire description before adding this one to your cart.  So looking forward to watching this with my two year old grandson on Christmas day and we talked about it for hours before trying to watch and then we couldn't get it to work as it only plays in region 2.  Seller won't work with you and I tried to return it and stood in line for over an hour at the post office and it costs more to return it than it costs.  Better to throw in the trash.  So disappointed in this product.,1515801600,,502,4.091836734693878

8463681,4,B005AUWY4A,"This packaging is awesome, you will need a region free player to play this on just like with most over sea's items one might get. The only thing that is a small issue with the packaging is it is hard to get back in without feeling like you will damage the box. I hate to tap a flap so that it would stay in place but other then that a great packaging. I am happy to add this set to my other Disney sets I own.",1499299200,,409,3.7674418604651163
