7925937,1,B00004XMT8,"This goes into the WASTE OF TIME vault.  Here's what I don't get: if you want to make something that is ACTUALLY HOT, get REAL lesbians and film them really doing it.  Sex and lame acting DO NOT make anything hot, no matter what they actually do, especially when you're talking about women having sex together. Skip this garbage...

SEXY love scenes: Bound, Fingersmith, Desert Hearts, Loving Annabelle, Tipping the Velvet, Better Than Chocolate, Portrait of a Marriage to name a few.  WOW, and imagine this, they are actually great movies with quality acting and a PLOT.",1177545600,,571,4.855670103092783
7925938,1,B00004XMT8,"The plan was to order a little soft porn for sweetie and I. This `movie' was NOT what it seemed to be advertised as. It is clips of a handful of women kissing set to some music.  I'm all for good erotic kissing but this wasn't it.  Visualize straight women at a party kissing each other to get a rise out of the other partygoers.  Then imagine those girls out in the woods somewhere and you pretty much have the gist of this movie.
After you suffer through 15-20minutes of this film, the scenes you just saw play back again in short little clips - as if ONCE wasn't enough!
I say pass on this one. There is better erotica portrayed in Bound, Better than Choc and Kissing Jessica Stein.",1063584000,25,685,4.253846153846154
