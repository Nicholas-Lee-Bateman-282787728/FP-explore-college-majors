8634173,4,B00HQ6WQBW,"This engaging story includes clever plot twists and plenty of subtle and overt humor.  I think Ransomed is acceptable for all ages.  While there is some violence, it is not intense at all.  It was just right to hold the interest of my younger boys, ages 5 and 7.  My 13-year-old girl laughed out loud at the snarky dialog.  My 14-year-old girl was enthralled by the horse character (played so skillfully by real-life horse, Midnight).  While the lighting and audio is quite rough, I appreciate the effort put into sets, costumes and props.  I enjoyed the more passionate performances, the reverse angle dialog shots, the understated musical score, and the charming natural sounds of songbirds, frogs and geese.  The bloopers are a must-see.",1402099200,,740,4.959349593495935
