8510343,4,B007549X5C,"Even a sub par W&W is better than most comedies made today. Having Wheeler and Woolsey at each others throats was a novel idea, and is interesting as a one shot experiment but what made W&W great was their camaraderie. The plot has Wheeler and Woolsey as rambunctious partners in a drug company. When Wheeler loses to Woolsey in a wrestling match it is agreed that he becomes Woolsey's butler. Bert tries to conceal this from his girlfriend (Marjorie Lord) but proves unsuccessful. The highlights are gags taken from their past movies like the slap dance (from The Cuckoos) and Bert singing a song while crying and eating a sandwich. As for the supporting cast Esther Muir (as Woolsey's acerbic wife) and Russell Hicks ( as their put upon harassed lawyer) are the standouts. The transfer is excellent but there are no extras as is the case in most Warner Bros .dvd's. I do wish they included the trailer because it includes scenes not in the film. So if you are a W&W fan purchase this because it may be your cup of tea.",1524700800,,1020,4.548913043478261

8510345,3,B007549X5C,"In spite of a good comedy director (Eddie Cline, who worked with the great W.C. Fields) & good writers (Nat Perrin & Benny Rubin), 1937's ""On Again, Off Again"" resulted in one of Bert Wheeler & Robert Woolsey's weaker efforts. As feuding co-owners of a drug company who make a bet in which the winner seizes sole ownership and the loser must be the winner's servant for a year, it should have been a sure bet. Unfortunately not. Sure, it starts off well, and maintains a jaunty pace. But after the premise is introduced, the story just gets bland. Pitting the boys against one another during the bulk of the movie pretty much backfires, generating less laughs from the material. The problem doesn't lie with Bert & Bob; they maintain their usual comic irreverence. But even they cannot elevate a dull script that gives them little opportunity to cut loose. There's a lack of musical numbers, a cornerstone of W&W films. Leading lady Marjorie Lord (years before her TV fame on ""Make Room For Daddy"") is lovely but dull, while statuesque blond Esther Muir (remembered best as the deceptive floosie who gets wallpaper-plastered by the Marx Brothers in ""A Day at the Races"") fares better.
Mind you, the film isn't completely without merit: RKO gives the production polish & class worthy of a MGM picture. But this story would've worked better as a comedy short; it's stretched out too long & thin to the point my mind was wandering, a good indication that the movie was boring.
Not as bad as, say, their previous feature ""Mummy's Boys"", in which that material has been done much better with comedy teams like the Three Stooges or Abbott & Costello (their last film with Universal). But unfortunately, it's not far from it.",1395446400,,1718,4.749163879598663
8510346,1,B007549X5C,"By 1937, Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey had seen better days - their vaudevillian irreverence toned down by the Hays Office. After a bright start, ""On Again-Off Again"" falls into a downward spiral. Not even a veteran director such as Eddie Cline can enliven the tried-and-tired material. Sadly, the duo's penultimate film and one of their weakest efforts.

8510347,2,B007549X5C,"There are some cute song and dance numbers at the beginning, but, after that, I only saw tired old routines. I missed W&W's frequent female partner, Dorothy Lee. In fact, the entire supporting cast had no interesting or attractive characters. Most of this movie seemed to be pre-historic situation comedy. Comedic situations were supposed to carry the film. Thus, W&W were toned down and a cast of unknowns (to me) went through their flat lines  as what was supposed to be funny situations flowed along. It is possible that some of these situations were funny in 1937, but they have been done so often (and better done) since then, that the whole movie was flat, predictable and boring.",1370736000,,686,4.813559322033898
8510348,5,B007549X5C,"1937 was a strange year in Hollywood. Times were changing, and the type of comedy that was popular in the early 30's was becoming obsolete. W & W were trying new ideas with films like Silly Billies and High Flyers, but it just wasn't the same. On Again Off Again is a poor W & W film, but it does have it's points. The first 5 minutes is the best with the team performing a cute musical number called One Happy Family but the rest of the film falls a little flat. The film is for true W & W buffs who love them in anything. The best thing about the films is the DVR transfer which is from a pristine 35mm print. No DVNR is used, and it's better than TCM's print. If nothing else is leaps better the the C & C Television 16mm prints used in the 50's & 60's and it's complete at 68 minutes.",1334534400,,788,3.9622641509433962
