3498812,4,B001BSBBQC,I highly recommend this DVD.  It was a present to someone who repeatedly had talked about the Who's on First routine between Abbott and Costello.  I think I made his day with this surprise.  He loved every minute of it and was truly surprised and said Santa did good.  Very enjoyable.,1264464000,2,284,4.509803921568627
3498813,5,B001BSBBQC,"We needed it for the ""who's on first"" segment.  My husband is doing a class on communication and that is a great example of not doing it well.  Besides Abbott and Costello are timeless and shows you can have humor without cursing.",1261526400,,230,4.4523809523809526

3498817,5,B001BSBBQC,"Legend Films presents ""ABBOTT & COSTELLO: FUNNIEST ROUTINES VOL. One"" (1951-1954) (78 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- William (Bud) Abbott and Lou Costello (born Louis Francis Cristillo) performed together as Abbott and Costello, an American comedy duo whose work in radio, film and television made them the most popular comedy team during the 1940s --- Thanks to the endurance of their most popular and influential routine, ""Who's on First?""-- whose rapid-fire word play and comprehension confusion set the preponderant framework for most of their best-known routines--the team is, as a result, featured in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Universal signed them to a long-term contract, and their second film, Buck Privates, (1941) made them box-office stars --- In most of their films, the plot was a framework for the two comics to reintroduce comedy routines they first performed on stage --- Universal also added glitzy, gratuitous production numbers (a formula borrowed from the Marx Brothers comedies) featuring The Andrews Sisters, Ted Lewis and his Orchestra, and other musical acts --- They made 36 films together between 1940 and 1956 --- Abbott and Costello were among the most popular and highest-paid entertainers in the world during World War II --- Other film successes included Hold That Ghost, Who Done It?, Pardon My Sarong, The Time of Their Lives, Buck Privates Come Home, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man.

In 1942, Abbott and Costello were the top box office draw with a reported take of $10 million --- They would remain a top ten box office attraction until 1952 --- In 1951, they moved to television as rotating hosts of The Colgate Comedy Hour (Eddie Cantor and Martin and Lewis were among the others.) --- Each show was a live hour of vaudeville in front of a theater audience, revitalizing the comedians' performances and giving their old routines a new sparkle --- Contrary to popular belief, however, the duo was not inducted into the Hall -- (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

3498818,5,B001BSBBQC,"Abbot & Costello: Funniest Routines Vol 1 is a great collection of classic routines from my favorite comedy team. There is close to an hour and a half of comedy on the disc, and they're the type of bits the whole family can enjoy.

There's a wide variety of stuff here, and it all looks great. Two of the bonus features have been colorized, the rest are presented from a great B&W print, that is probably the best one I've seen. The bonus features that are presented in color are the Trailer for ""Abbot & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" and a Campbell's Soup commercial. Here's hoping for an all out colorized version of A&C Meet Frankenstein!

For the curious among you, here's a list of the included routines:

-Hole in the Wall
-Mustard
-The Magic Act Bit
-Aspirin
-Army Drill
-Niagara Falls
-Jonah and the Whale
-7 X 13 is 28
-The Piano Bit
-The Lemon Bit
-The Dice Game

3498829,5,B001BSBBQC,"From one of their early television shows, the gags just don't stop. I teach a comedy elective for high school students and they loved Whose on First and the sketch where Lou is not supposed to say TIN. The picture could be better, but I'm not going to grouse over a 60 year old tape from n old tv show. This is Bud and Lou at their best when it comes to doing vaudeville-like  sketches. The sketches are short, but non stop. I laughed until I had tears in my eyes and I am not an A and C fan. I prefer Laurel and Hardy. For the price, you can't miss this.",1428624000,2,555,3.955357142857143
