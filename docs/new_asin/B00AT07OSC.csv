8557458,5,B00AT07OSC,"Dr. Greger's nutritionfacts series is truly amazing! He combines all the latest nutrition information and research in an informative and entertaining way. I had the pleasure of experiencing his talk first hand, and he is even better in person. I highly recommend his site, and for you to support his work through purchasing these DVDs! Go to his website if you haven't yet done so.",1358726400,3,381,4.876923076923077
8557459,3,B00AT07OSC,"I love Dr. Greger's website and look forward to each new video.  Being the impatient type, I decided to get volume 12 so I wouldn't have to wait for each new video.  The content, as usual, is superb, but the DVD format is horrible.

I envisioned a list of videos that allowed me to choose which ones to watch.  There are 40 chapters (videos) on the DVD, but no way to access individual chapters.  The only selection option is to select a grouping of chapters; 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40.  Within the grouping there's no way to get to an individual video, unless it's the 1st one in a group. You can scan up and down trying to find the one you're searching for, but there's no way to tell which one you're watching.

I am dumbfounded that this video is so poorly designed. This will definitely be the last video I purchase.",1358121600,7,821,4.3618421052631575
