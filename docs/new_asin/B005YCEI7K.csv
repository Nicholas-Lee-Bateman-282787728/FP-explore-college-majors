4905493,3,B005YCEI7K,"Ice Quake falls short because it's yet another in a long list of generic action flicks involving natural disasters.

This film does absolutely NOTHING to stand apart from the other ones that dominate the video market. It's about a family that is, of course, helpless and stuck in a danger zone where these super strong, world-altering earthquakes appear in Alaska while the family is exploring the snowy mountains. You guessed it- the earthquakes eventually cause destructive avalanches and, more frequently, cause the ground to crack and open up on SEVERAL occasions.

On one occasion, the ground opens up and separates a sister and brother from their parents, so the parents are forced to work their way around the mountain and retrieve their kids.

Speaking of predictability, how about the segment where the helicopter comes down and rescues a man in need of medical help and then... at that exact moment, you guessed it, the ground opens up and inevitably causes the chopper to freeze and collapse into a mountain... with a generic computer animated explosion to boot.

Another popular theme are the geysers that pop out of the ground randomly.  Coincidentally they ONLY pop out of the ground when people are around and... coincidentally, the geysers actually FOLLOW the people until they make it to safe ground.  This means you'll constantly witness people running uphill as the geyser holes open up behind them.  Give me a break!

We've seen this story a thousand times with tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. It's nothing new.",1323475200,2,1538,5.075396825396825

4905644,4,B005YCEI7K,"This one is fun, with special effects that are more believable than most SyFy movies.  OK, we're not talking Carl Sagen or Albert Einstein level scientists here,  but it's possible to accept this situation within it's format and the action keeps coming fast and furious. I also liked Victor Garber's military man, who isn't the usual cardboard villain attempting to do damage control on the bad situation to avoid blame and keep his own job. Nice also to avoid the cliche of parents on the verge of divorce who are pulled close again by surviving the disasters. This family has moderately whiny kids but a basically good family structure that didn't need to be rebuilt.  Nice!  I find this kind of film a great popcorn movie, just sit back, put my mind in neutral,  and watch the disasters fly thick and fast.  This movie delivers the goods on that level; I'll watch it again.",1417824000,6,876,4.6558441558441555

4905654,4,B005YCEI7K,"I don't watch movies like this to learn dubious `science.'  I watch in the hopes of being entertained, at the very least pleasantly diverted from the cares and woes of life in general.  As a typical SyFy disaster flick, this one isn't all that bad.  You get to see Santa on a snowmobile `geysered' to death by a blast of ice.  If nothing else, this movie provides a good object lesson, don't put off hunting for your Christmas tree until Christmas Eve day when the world could possibly end due to a sneaky flow of methane gas snaking its way under Alaska.  IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD!  Sort of.  The lead actors (Brendan Fehr & Jodelle Ferland) are agreeable enough, given the circumstances.  Victor Garber tends to be a bit bombastic in the role of an army colonel driven to drink lots of coffee at the oddest times.  The children are a little rough around the edges.  But there's some beautiful mountain scenery.  Plus, a whole lot of whining, animated chasms galore, and a hilarious solution to the problem at hand (when in doubt, blow it up).

Believe it or not, but this is part of my Christmas viewing lineup.  Nothing says Merry Christmas like the sight of human popsicles littering the snow, caught in the middle of making snow angels.",1387152000,10,1242,4.54054054054054

4905659,5,B005YCEI7K,"Love the story with all the action you can give like this one, Partying for the Christmas going to chop down their tree ready for the next day, Than the fun begins a huge ice shelf has hit the water causing shockwaves to create mass avalanches and ice geysers which have left large cracks in the land. Sound exciting well I'll give you a hint it is, The actors and cast did a fantastic role making me freeze while watching this show but I must admit I did enjoy so I rated this an A grade plus. Full of surprises plus a lot of suspense and fulfilling entertainment, No more hints as not to spoil the movie. So what else do you need go for it. Relax feet up and be the judge for yourself.",1362614400,9,687,4.0962962962962965
4905660,2,B005YCEI7K,"Drastic shifts in the Alaskan permafrost have begun to cause earth-shattering quakes and ice geysers, trapping an archaeologist and his family out in the cold during their winter retreat. For what it is, ICE QUAKE stacks up against other low-budget, made-for-television disaster pictures like ARCTIC BLAST or METEOR STORM in delivering cheap thrills and moderate effects on a meager budget. Disaster is always the operative term here, since the plot inconsistencies, stagnant characters, and poor computerization have become characteristic of the genre, but director Paul Ziller has done everything he can to try and make this passable entertainment. The sequence of events are predictable and contrived as always, but this keeps the action moving at a decent pace throughout. TV's Brendan Fehr and Victor Garber both do what they can to attach some emotionality to the characters. These low-budget mockbusters wouldn't continue to be made if there was not already a built-in audience, so fans of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW or ARCTIC BLAST should enjoy!

4905664,4,B005YCEI7K,"Ireally enjoyed this film and I am 70 with two+ masters degrees.  I like disaster movies that don't involve evil but just silliness and real bad luck.  The family relations seem quite realistheric for a nice family.  The quakes and explosions were exciting and realistic looking.  I think the acting was generally good, especially the son, the one assisstant to the head guy.  I really like the 'hero'.  I remember him from Bones as Booth's brother.
  It was not realistic which is reassuring.  If I wanted realism I would read and watch programs like the killings at the movies out west or watch all news shows.  Keep in touch with reality but don't consider it entertainment.",1344211200,,677,4.758620689655173
4905665,3,B005YCEI7K,"I think this movie was much more entertaining and believable compared to the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arctic-Blast/dp/B004NTC7EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arctic Blast</a>&nbsp;with Michael Shanks (Stargate SG-1) in it. I think they both came out around the same time so im comparing the two. Both are disaster movies about ice/cold yea you get the jist. Both are B kind of movies, with some poor acting and dialogue. While the effects are somewhat better than the acting. While Arctic Blast the disaster was coming above to earth this one was coming from below and coming up.
See plots with what i mean with that:
Plot of Arctic Blast:
When a solar eclipse sends a colossal blast of super chilled air towards the earth, it then sets off a catastrophic chain of events that threatens to engulf the world in ice and begin a new Ice Age.
Plot of Ice Quake:
Beneath the Alaskan landscape, the melting permafrost is about to drastically alter the tranquil scenery. As the permafrost thaws, underground rivers of volatile liquid Methane are created, causing a succession of violent and destructive earthquakes. It's a race against time to stop the deadly rivers before they lead to a catastrophic explosion that threatens the planet.

Watching Arctic Blast I couldn't follow the science of it while this one i can so it made it much easier to believe and get sucked in. I enjoyed the effects especially the part when the ice geyser came up and frozen the helicopter which stopped it from functioning, came crashing down and exploded! Why didn't the kids go up the mountain along their parents. that way they still saw them and was still together. maybe just me but I wouldn't leave my kids to just stay there and go through the stuff that is happening when they don't know whats going on and when its going too. How did Jodelle's character Tia loose her brother so fast when she was getting more snow, don't get that its not like their was no tracks and he was wearing a red coat and i doubt he was actually really that far away and gone that far away from her in those seconds. The teenager scene at the ski lodge was stupid and could have been eliminated! Why is it in a lot of these kind of movies the women are bitching about their men's work??  They work with the government you think their job don't mean much than or what? you married them you should know what their job and everything about them entails its like really lady shut up and deal or why you get married to them? thats how i think anyway lol. Typical ending they stop the destruction, they get their christmas tree, and their dog back, family is strong once again and dada...happy ending lol",1334966400,3,2712,4.792735042735043

4905667,1,B005YCEI7K,"And apparently producing a lousy flick as well.

Prototypical fare destined for SciFi's Weekend rotation. Cheesy digital effects, worthless acting, crummy cinematography, and complete rubbish passing for a screenplay.

What little fun was watching veteran character actor, Victor Garber, do a ""Mr. Coffee"". Classic example of prop overuse and lack of directional oversight.

The only good thing in the entire flick was Yeti, played admirably by Cody The Dog. Arguably the best actor on the set. Cutest too.

Like all good low-budget films - if properly handled and some attention to detail put in place, you can score a nice little hit. But this is the kind of B-Movie that the other B-Movies laugh at.",1329091200,2,702,5.078260869565217

4905670,1,B005YCEI7K,"First, the science is really really bad. Large methane deposits in the mountains of Fairbanks is not too likely - gold, yes. Second, the CGI of cracks in surface snow somehow going deep into ancient bedrock - not even close. Humorously, the cracks always showed up just where someone happened to be - those cracks must have it out for humans. Even if the methane was twice as low as the -25 degrees F it would not instantly freeze a fully cold-weather clothed person in half a second or so of exposure. In fact you could expose that person to a quick vent of liquid nitrogen, ballpark -321 degrees F, for the same period of time and probably nothing would happen. The random buried cannon snow blasts to represent methane venting looked more like a July 4 pyrotechnic. Placing a Geologic Services cabin in an obvious avalanche pathway was pure dumb.
Second, the portrayal of the military as dumb-ass and shoot any citizen for the most trivial reasons was pure Hollywood. The actor's portrayal of the rebellious daughter, nerdy son and, yes-dear, mother were all stereotypical and thankfully forgetful.  The script was so bad that fast forwarding was the only escape. Really dumb was the decision when, of course conveniently, a snow crack separated the parents from kids so they decide to hike up the mountain to join each other rather than down or even to just jump across those parts that were separated by just a few feet.
Third, the ending where a couple of hand held explosives stopped the massive cracks was so ridiculous that fast forwarding again was the only escape.
Fourth, usual made-for-TV actor's filmography of TV series, TV movies and video games so you know what to expect.",1326240000,7,1689,4.764505119453925
4905671,1,B005YCEI7K,"We rented a family friendly movie (Kung Fu Panda 2) and received this rental movie free.  It is a painful movie to watch.  The dialog is unbelievable, the plot is completely predictable, the acting is poor.  We spent time duration of the movie poking fun at all the stupid things we watched and there were plenty.

I generally try to leave positive reviews on products but this one was so bad, I had to say something.

In one scene, the headquarters loses power (backup power comes on) due to a large tremor.  Stuff inside the building falls all over the place, leaving the building in bit of a mess.  Shortly later, however, all the books are nicely stacked - the Christmas cookies are even arranged nicely again...

In another scene, the back end of a military truck gets blown up into the air. Naturally the family in the back is hardly hurt (one girl breaks a leg) but the poor tough military person sitting in the front is knocked out completely.  The mom (sitting in the back) gets out of the back and is able to drive the vehicle (stick shift).

Listen for the squealing tires on a gravel road...  The kid walks away from his sister on the mountain without saying a word to her even though they are in a traumatic situation...

It was just so poorly done that it was very hard not to poke fun at it throughout really turning this into a poor comedy.  We don't watch many movies so maybe we are just aren't numb to stupidity like this.

On a positive note, it is fairly family friendly with just a few swear words in it.",1325808000,15,1526,4.365248226950355
4905672,4,B005YCEI7K,"Enjoyable for what it is.  Fairly good acting and effects.  However, one major problem is that the military controlled all the actions and police functions.  No call was ever made to the police, sheriff, mayor or governor.  This, of course, is a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878.",1325808000,2,291,4.76
4905673,3,B005YCEI7K,"SciFy does it again---another disaster movie!  It has all the elements of other ""classic"" films like MEGAFAULT, POLAR STORM, ICE TWISTERS, etc.
This one is set on Christmas Eve in a small Alaskan village where a young geologist and his family go looking for a Christmas tree and find themselves confronting an ice quake that also spouts ice geysers!
The science is preposterous; the effects aren't very special; and nothing of major importance happens.  The quakes are caused by massive amounts of methane gas (?) and our hero finds a way to channel the gas to an oil refinery...you can guess how a happy ending is inevitable.
Brendan Fehr (CSI, BONES) and Victor Garber (ALIAS, ELI STONE) try gamely but don't have much to work with.
