8714317,5,B00WUDIVVK,"Michiel de Ruyter was one of the greatest admirals who ever lived. However, he also lived in very interesting times indeed. At the same time that the Netherlands was threatened by the English *and* the French, the nation was split against itself  Orangists versus republicans.

This movie tells the story of Admiral de Ruyter, his personal life, his political life and his military life. The story is very well written, giving the viewer a thumbnail view of the great man and his times, while also providing some really great action. The CGI work is very good, providing some really interesting fleet-level action sequences. Also, I must say that Frank Lammers did a great job of portraying the great, but conflicted admiral.

Yeah, if you are at all interested in the era of wooden ships and iron men, then you really should check out this movie. Its great!",1469750400,,858,4.8231292517006805
8714318,4,B00WUDIVVK,"Admiral de Ruyter is one of the most accomplished marine leaders of all times, but he is practically unknown in the United States, even though some of his exploits were in this hemisphere. This film chronicles his participation in the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch war, and his involvement in the Republican v monarchist (Orangist) political struggles of the time. There are poignant moments between himself and his third wife, Anna, very moving. The special effects of the three or four sea battles are well done, and the models are excellent. The computer graphics remind one of a well-made computer simulation; the North Sea and Mediterranean were rendered more calmly than reality can tolerate. Well made, and not too many blunders in the English subtitles during the scenes that have Netherlands dialogue.",1466294400,,809,5.183206106870229
8714319,4,B00WUDIVVK,"A good film, but I think only for the student of the period, and one willing to overlook obvious instances of artistic license.  For example, the film begins in the early 1650's and ends about 25 years later, but somehow neither de Ruyter nor his wife and children age even a day.  Events that in reality were separated by five years seem to follow immediately upon one another.  The depiction of Johan de Witt and the republicans versus supporters of the House of Orange is gripping but unexplained, and will probably seem baffling to anyone not Dutch nor a student of the period.  The naval action sequences are dramatic, and via the magic of special effects technology literally give an overview of ship movement and battle tactics.  This is a good film if you're interested in the period and in Dutch history, especially concerning the internal politics of the First Stadtholderless Period or the naval tactics of the first three Anglo-Dutch wars.",1446163200,3,951,4.845679012345679
8714320,4,B00WUDIVVK,"Admiral: Command and Conquer is the English Language release of a Dutch film about the great 17th Century Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter. With a prologue depicting a somewhat ahistorical version of the Battle of Scheveningen in 1653, the film depicts the de Ruyter's career, and Dutch politics, from the time he took over as Lieutenant-Admiral (which effectively meant commander) of the Dutch navy until his last battle in 1676.

It's a dramatic and visually sumptuous film which is a must-see for fans of sailing navy action. Some aspects of the history are presented very well indeed, but be warned that other aspects of the history presented are so ridiculous that purists who like their historical fiction to bear some resemblance to actual history may find themselves reaching for something to throw at the screen. For example the very first words of the film are The Seventeenth Century: the Netherlands is the only republic in the world.

DOH! What about Switzerland, Venice, and Genoa?

The cover of the DVD box of ""Admiral"" gives the impression that Charles Dance is the central character: actually he plays Charles II of Britain, who is the villain. Of course, since this is a Dutch film about a Dutch national hero, and Britain and Holland were at war for almost all the timeframe of the film, making the king of an enemy nation the villain was not a controversial or surprising thing, but that DVD box is a bit misleading.

British and Dutch historians who know much more about the 17th century and the navies of the time than I do have praised the depiction of 17th century ""fighting sail"" combat in this film. They had some fun teasing the film-makers about the fact that the Union Flag on British ships was shown in the wrong place (as an Ensign at the stern rather than a Jack at the masthead) though at least they did use a historically accurate version of the flag. The first Union flag created in 1606 following the Union of the English and Scottish crowns was a combination of the Cross of St George and the Saltire and this is correctly shown in the film. (The diagonal red bars of St Patrick's cross were not added until 1801.)

The role of de Ruyter and ""Grand Pensionary"" Johan de Witt in reforming the Dutch navy (just as Samuel Pepys radically reformed Britain's Royal Navy at approximately the same time) is presented very quickly as if it was all done and dusted in one short meeting, but is broadly accurate. De Ruyter is indeed remembered as the founder of Holland's marine corps, though he was not the inventor of the concept (that goes back at least as far as the Romans!) De Witt is referred to in the film as ""Prime Minister"" which is probably the closest thing to an accurate modern equivalent of the title of ""Grand Pensionary.""

Although the film covers a period of 23 years the viewer could be forgiven for assuming it was a much shorter period of time: De Ruyter's family do not age: for example, his son is presented as being a gangly adolescent throughout the film, which he was indeed at the time of Scheveningen, but he was a senior captain by the time of the Battle of Augusta. And as the time is rather shortened the enemy commanders are rolled together.

The same actor plays the French admiral in command both at the battle of the Texel and at de Ruyter's last fight, the Battle of Augusta. That character is named in the cast list at the end of the film as Abraham Duquesne, which is the name of the Admiral in command at Augusta, one of the most successful French naval commanders of all time. Perhaps fortunately for the Dutch, Duquesne was not in command of the French fleet at the Texel: the French admiral at that battle was Jean D'Estrees. The film presents the French ships at the Texel as suffering a fate remarkably like what in real history happened to D'estrees' fleet five years later in the Caribbean.

Similarly the British are shown as having the same command team, George Monck and Prince Rupert, at the Four Days battle in 1666 and the Texel in 1673. In reality Monck was the British Commander in Chief at the former battle, which Prince Rupert of the Rhine's squadron only joined on the last day. Prince Rupert then took over as commander of the British fleet. He still held that position six years later and was in overall command of the British and French combined fleet at the Texel.

In the trailer the words ""I think it would be unwise to underestimate de Ruyter"" are taken from the film's depiction of a briefing of allied commanders before the Battle of the Texel. In the film they are spoken by George Monck: in real history he had died of natural causes three years before in 1670.

Without wishing to spoil the ending of the film by explaining exactly what is wrong with it, the depiction of de Ruyter's final campaign in the Mediterranean in 1676 and of the battle of Augusta is a travesty of the truth. William the Third of England and the Netherlands and Second of Scotland was no saint, but the idea that he betrayed de Ruyter in the manner depicted in this film is risible. The iconic depiction near the end of the film of de Ruyter leading his fleet into battle against the French at Augusta is great as drama but utter nonsense as history.

Having said all that, the depiction of 17th century naval warfare was both very dramatic and generally well done, and the presentation of the interaction between the fight to preserve Dutch independence and the power struggles within Dutch politics - between supporters of the Republic and of the House of Orange - was both clever and, I am told, accurate. It doesn't pull punches and the grisly fate of the Republican leaders Johan and Cornelis de Witt is presented in gory detail.

All characters are shown speaking in the appropriate languages, with suitable subtitles for the relevant releases of the film: for example Charles II, Monck and other British characters speak English and in the UK version there are subtitles for the French and Dutch characters.

It's an entertaining film and many parts of it are excellent. A pity that one or two others, particularly the depiction of de Ruyters' final mission, are so utterly inaccurate. But if you are interested in the age of fighting sail, you can no more miss this film than you could miss ""Master and Commander.""",1445299200,3,6295,4.634977578475336
