7975738,3,6304610890,"When a crew member on board a boat finds a cursed statue, he is possessed and transformed into a strange dinosaur like monster and begins attacking the other crew members in this B movie creature flick that isn't for mainstream horror fans. The movie begins quickly with some blood and then a Krista Allen shower scene that has topless and rear nudity. After this, the pace does slow up. However, later on when the guy transforms into the creature, the pace picks up again and gets fast. The film is low budget, but the creature is really well done for the budget. There's a decent amount of gore in the film with some pretty good FX, as well as some good nude scenes with Krista Allen. Aside from the shower scene, she lies fully nude on a table. Although it's difficult to see much full frontal nudity in this scene because it's out of focus. The latter portions of the film are pretty fast and fun with a good amount of action, but the movie has some problems. I thought it should've had more atmosphere, and the directing could've been a bit better. It also should've maintained that fast pace from the beginning because this is just a B monster flick that I want to see for action and exploitation stuff. If you like low budget and easy to follow creature films with gore, action, and nudity, you might like this one.

This looks like it was mastered from a VHS master and this is disappointing. The quality looks pretty good overall for something that used a VHS master, but it would've been so much better if they used a film print that gave a brighter and sharper picture with better contrast and color.",1367193600,,1611,4.479591836734694

7975740,3,6304610890,"As a Krista Allen fan, The Haunted Sea certainly belongs in my bookcase.  She shoulders the lead, and without ruining the film for anyone, Ms Allen does as well as the script and director permit.  The creature effects reminded me of my days at the matinees during the '50s.  Historical accuracy goes out the window, so just kick back with your finger on the rewind button for the Krista Allen scenes.:)",1014422400,8,402,4.633802816901408
7975741,3,6304610890,"In typical Roger Corman style, the budget is low,the script paper thin. Yet, Krista Allen gives asincere effort with little to lend support. James Brolin, Joanna Pacula try too! Enjoyable if you don'ttake it  seriously.  Krista's Beauty makes it worth price of admission.",952300800,6,271,5.27906976744186
