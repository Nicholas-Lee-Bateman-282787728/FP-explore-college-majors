5832952,1,B0074V2SKS,"Although this dvd follows many rabbinic teachings it is not what most would consider ""Biblical"". I found it confusing and quite scary at times. I was really disappointed in the storyline. I had hoped for an accurate portrayal of the Esther story for our Messianic Purim celebration. I'm sure it would be appropriate for those looking for teachings from a tradition Jewish perspective, but not exactly Biblical.",1425945600,3,410,5.134328358208955
5832953,2,B0074V2SKS,I liked this video however in my opinion it's a litel um-scary (at least for young american children),1425427200,2,101,4.666666666666667

5832958,5,B0074V2SKS,"I would say that this film is by far more intelligent than most of today's feature animation. It calls on you to think, to reflect, and to experience the story.",1360022400,,160,4.366666666666666
5832959,4,B0074V2SKS,"While this is not to be compared to Russian animation classics, it is in a league way above the ""heimishe"" productions that American Jewish kids are exposed to these days.",1330560000,2,171,4.733333333333333

8594399,1,B0074V2SKS,"I've been a Hebrew school educator for almost 20 years.
I organized a group of four year old kids and adults to see this movie. IT WAS DISTURBING!!!
1. The movie is Not rated but it is NOT FOR CHILDREN!!! It should be rated PG13 for graphic violence; stabbing with blood coming out, strangling with choking noises, hanging, selling chained human beings in a slave market, etc. DO NOT LET THAT IT'S ANIMATION MISLEAD YOU!!!
2. The movie was TOLD WITH A LOT OF RABBINICAL PRETEXT INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL BIBLICAL TEXT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STORY OF ESTHER. I actually wondered MANY times if this movie was about the story Purim or if the DVD was an error!!!
3. The narration is told through the story of the son through the helper going back and forth in time and history. The narration is disjointed, hard to follow and easy to loose focus on what the story is about. It was easy for ALL THE ADULTS & KIDS TO LOOSE INTETEST -the opposite of what a good movie should be.
4. The story's goal seems more on how the Jews returned to Jerusalem as opposed to how they were saved on Purim, complicatingly combining two stories in two different points in history into one . The story of Purim is basic and beautiful and this movie made it very complex and a quite distasteful.

8594401,3,B0074V2SKS,"This portrays the story of Esther pretty accurately but it also is a little violent for younger viewers. I would suggest you screen it yourself before letting young children view it.  If you stop right after hamen's demise, you get the  gist of the redemption of God's Chosen people  without the "" suggestion""
of further violence and hardships that befall's them later in the film. This review is written from a Christian person's perspective so I can't attest to what the Jewish view would be about the film.",1453507200,2,509,4.761363636363637
8594402,1,B0074V2SKS,"Junk. The story began to follow the bible. But had A TON of incorrect information! Does NOT MAKE ANY SENSE. It wasn't a smooth plotline and had a bunch of bologne containing reincarnation. It's like a mix between hinduism, and christianity and jewish beliefs. WEIRD!",1450569600,,266,4.933333333333334
8594403,5,B0074V2SKS,"Great video for kids and family, educational and very informative. well done in a good quality just like Disney cartoon.
There is one scene is scary for some kids, but makes it more emotional. Would love more films like it for each holiday.",1443830400,2,240,4.604651162790698

8594406,3,B0074V2SKS,"This is an animated retelling of the Jewish Purim story.  I found the movie to be generally entertaining and somewhat informative, but the story was disjointed at times.  In particular, the multiple different ways they narrated was jumpy and sometimes jarring.  The animation is higher quality than I would expect from a religious movie, but not Pixar quality by any means.  Overall I'd recommend this movie to viewers at least somewhat familiar with the story, or else you might get lost.  This version is especially good for families, as it glosses over some of the grittier details.",1440115200,3,585,4.989690721649485
