5424234,5,B00AG6Z5QC,"I met Billy Steers a few years ago in LaPorte Indiana, stayed at the same bed and breakfast the year of the tornado. What a great guy, sat in on a couple of his classess, interacts well with the kids as well as the grownups. Very educational.",1365379200,,242,4.170212765957447
5424235,5,B00AG6Z5QC,This was enjoyed by adults as well as my 2 1/2 year old grandson. He has the stories memorized page  by page. It was interesting to see how the pictures were drawn. Tractors are his all time favorite. I have a couple more books to buy to complete his collection.,1361059200,,262,4.24
5424236,4,B00AG6Z5QC,Watched it with my preK son who enjoyed it.  Same format as John Deere series with same type music.  Good illustrations from the books.,1358985600,,135,4.583333333333333
5424237,5,B00AG6Z5QC,"My one year old and three year old LOVE the Tractor Mac books, so they always request to watch this when they get some TV time.  I like that it's kind of ""Reading Rainbow"" style with the author reading the books and the camera showing the illustrations, no animations.  Then there is real footage of antique tractors in between stories which reminds the kids of our hometown parades, so that's fun.  I just wish they would make more than one of these shows!",1475107200,,457,4.481927710843373

5424239,4,B00AG6Z5QC,"They took his family now he must harvest thier souls in fields of pain. No in all seriousness this show is great for little kids that love tractors, not a lot of options out there. I bet I have watched it over 10 times with my boy. The mix of real tractors and a story is a neat concept.",1473465600,,287,3.8813559322033897

5424282,5,B00AG6Z5QC,"I really liked this video for my two year old.  We have seen almost all of the John Deere videos and it was nice to finally find this one that was different.  And the songs are much better too!!  I personally liked the fact that it revolved around reading a book as well.  My son has just started showing interest in ""reading"" books.",1444176000,,333,4.238095238095238

5424289,5,B00AG6Z5QC,My grandchildren love this DVD.  Couldn't have found a better one.,1421712000,,66,5.0
5424290,3,B00AG6Z5QC,My son is more interested in the real tractors and gets distracted by the story line.,1419552000,,85,4.375
5424291,5,B00AG6Z5QC,"Love, love, love this.  A real stand out among mediocre DVD offerings for toddlers/preschoolers.  This one is better because it alternates live tractor action with narrated and illustrated stories and songs.  Not kiddy songs, but ones sung by a grown up.  The two books that Billy Steers reads are Tractor Mac Tune Up and Tractor Mac Harvest Time.  I recommend getting those too so your child can read along.  Super cute and just the right length.  As a bonus for an older preschooler, Billy Steers teaches you how to draw Tractor Mac at the end of the DVD.",1417651200,3,557,4.622448979591836
5424292,5,B00AG6Z5QC,My kids love this movie. Thank you!,1410566400,,35,4.142857142857143
5424293,5,B00AG6Z5QC,"He loves race cars and McQueen, but Tractor Mac is #1 now. It teaches the parts of the tractor, engine and other farm equipment with words printed for my 5 year old granddaughter to read and learn on the video, NOT boring for them. They both know almost all the parts after just a couple times watching. They are learning so much about the farm life that I grew up on which thrills me since we had IH tractors. I point out some of the models we had. I also have the CD with 3 of the stories and I am ordering the book set that goes with it, and the plates. He is totally thrilled with Tractor Mac. The end of the DVD shows how Bill Sears draws the pictures for the book. He really knows how to capture the attention throughout the entire video with learning songs and music. It is not animated, which I was concerned at first if they would even stick with it, but it is very well done to hold their attention.",1401148800,,909,4.112359550561798
5424294,3,B00AG6Z5QC,My 3.5 year old son was excited to have a dvd on CASE... but truly this dvd misses the mark for repeated entertainment. We own the John Deere series and he watches those daily. This one he watched 2x and felt it was enough for months.,1401062400,,234,4.108695652173913
5424295,5,B00AG6Z5QC,Really awesome video one of my wife's best friends and cousins love for their day care center. The children enjoy watching it a lot. Thanks So Much Keith & Aubrianna,1388361600,,165,4.533333333333333

8551300,1,B00AG6Z5QC,Horrible.  Waste of money and time.,1510876800,,35,4.833333333333333
8551301,5,B00AG6Z5QC,"It your child loves tractors they will love this video!  It shows real tractors and the author reads 2 of his friendly Tractor Mac stories.  It's a great tool if you want your child to meet an author, but can't in person.",1488931200,,221,4.238095238095238
8551302,4,B00AG6Z5QC,"Having watched this many, many, many, many, many times with my three-year-old son, I must say that it had a high rewatchability. Two charming stories, read by author Billy Steers, good tractor footage ( especially for IH fans) and fun, singable songs. My only regrets is that they didn't shoot more episodes.",1486166400,,308,4.9423076923076925
