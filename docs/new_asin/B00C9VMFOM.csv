8578949,5,B00C9VMFOM,"Although I have not ordered this DVD, since I don't have a compatible player, I can tell you that this is an excellent movie about a young Japanese married couple working through some tensions and past traumas, but also living in the moment. I loved it!  I hope that Amazon will make a US version available for DVD or preferably to rent or download digitally.  The version I saw had English subtitles, and for someone who knows a little Japanese, it's a great review of the language as used in daily life.  A charming film - I would watch it a couple more times with friends if I could.",1375574400,,586,4.3577981651376145
