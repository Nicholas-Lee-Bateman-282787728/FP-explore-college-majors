8136343,2,B000H5HTTS,"""Emergency: The First Aid Videotape Library""  is a set of two VHS video tapes on first aid made in 1989. It covers several first aid procedures such as heart attacks & CPR, choking, bleeding, bone fractures, burns, nosebleeds, hypothermia & frostbite, heatstroke, poisoning, seizures, drowning, and strokes . It has introductory information and then demonstrations of the first aid techniques using several actors and CPR dummies.  NOTE: This is a VHS video tape, not a DVD, so you will need a VCR to play it.

While the video is professionally done and good quality, unfortunately it suffers a lot in presentation because it is done in a late 1980s era ""TV talk show"" set format with well-known actor David Birney interviewing first aid experts (physicians and paramedics) in front of an audience. The audience asks some questions throughout, and they are obviously all actors too. This format takes *a lot* of time so that what could be covered in a couple of hours takes several hours in the two tapes. Another negative is that the demonstrations (done on the side of the set) don't show much use of first aid supplies. It is more for a home or office situation where an ambulance is on the way.

You can learn basic first aid from these tapes but I found the format tedious. If you can buy the set for a few dollars it is probably still worth the price if you don't mind watching it over several sessions. It would be good to have a friend to practice the techniques with.

NOTE: There was also a *single* video tape available called just the ""Emergency First Aid Videotape"" (without the ""Library"") with an identical box cover. However, it is a completely different tape with a much better format. I has a narrator covering essentially the same topics as this tape but without the long talk show format. Then there are demonstrations of the first aid techniques. Again, not a lot of use of first aid kit supplies shown, but still adequate instruction.  The Emergency First Aid Video Tape Library two-tape set is labeled as from ""Chesterbrook Safety Corp."" and the single Emergency First Aid Video Tape is labeled as from "" R.J.M. Marketing,"" but they show same company address in Paoili, PA so they were probably made by the same company.

For some reason (perhaps liability concerns?) there are very few first aid DVDs available these days. You may be able to find old ones or video tapes from the Red Cross or the National Safety Council. NSC used to sell a decent basic first aid video tape in the early 1990s that I have also viewed. The Red Cross and NSC do have many basic and advanced first aid classes available all over the country, which is probably the best way to learn. There are also several good first aid books available.",1456185600,,2741,4.674273858921162
