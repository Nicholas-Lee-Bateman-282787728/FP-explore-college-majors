8759311,2,B01EP1NVXW,"This review is for the release, not the series.  So they make us wait a year and a half just to release this series in Japanese with subtitles only? Like this show is alot better then half the titles they are releasing and when they do release a dub it's like 2-3 years later when the show is no longer relevant, get your act together please.  People can go watch this show for free on Crunchyroll reason people buy dvd/blue ray sets are to get an English Audio track. This company just seems to get slower and slower with their releases, I mean they scooped the rights before this title even finished airing in Japan so why does it take over a year and a half to put it out with subtitle only?? I mean this show may be a little fan servicy but they are dubbing Monster Mutsume for crying out loud and skipping over dubbing this awesome show...bad move on their part. They better catch up with their competitors or they are soon to be ADV JR.",1471564800,8,942,4.256983240223463
