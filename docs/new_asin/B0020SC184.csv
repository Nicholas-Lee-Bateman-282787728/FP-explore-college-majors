8348631,5,B0020SC184,"Balsa and Chagum have decided to live in a mill on the outskirts of a fairly busy town. Their friends are also there. They have been given a brief reprieve and are beginning to settle in. Chagum has to do some training in order to fit in among all the commoners and city folk. Ther, and e are also some devious people lurking about that may expose them. Balsa almost gets caught by some soldiers while getting a new spear, and a madman challenges her to a rematch after his defeat years ago. They are trying to live a peaceful life, but it's a lot harder than it looks.

This is a great show. In these 2 volumes, many of the supporting characters are developed and gain more depth. Especially, Chagum, Tanga, Touya, and Shuga. This anime is very addicting. I've come to the point where I have to choose between staying up late and watching, or going to bed because I have to get up before sunrise. It's a hard decision. There is a lot to love about this series. These are some great volumes. I strongly recommend watching it, but probably on the weekend when you can afford to stay up late.",1357776000,,1090,4.3431372549019605
8348632,4,B0020SC184,"At this point the anime deviates from the original YA novel.  Balsa and Chagum move into water mill Balsa has rented from the owner.  She finally gets her spear repaired.  These 6 episodes deal Balsa  learning to raise a small boy and Chagum learning to live the life of a commoner.  He learns about money, friendship, and even gets into a fight with another boy.

The  2 DVDs in this pack had trouble playing in the introduction and production credits at the beginning, but once  they  reached the episode section played fine.",1272067200,,527,4.641304347826087
8348633,5,B0020SC184,"As with vols. 1 and 2, volumes 3 and 4 take us deeper into the two-world-based story of Balsa and her friends. Again, the animation dynamics and the script are great. A whole-round anime for anyone to enjoy it.",1264896000,,210,4.410256410256411
8348634,5,B0020SC184,"Moribito: Guradian of the Spirit Vols 3 and 4, twin pack, is the continuation of the story of Prince Chagum, carrier of a spirit egg, and his sworn bodyguard, Balsa, the spear wielder.

These volumes fill the backgrounds of the key characters and provides answers to why Balsa refuses to take another life.  This is just a small fraction of the story in this amazingly beautiful anime.  I highly recommend this twin pack of DVDs.  You will not be disappointed.

Plus, by purchasing the twin packs in this series, you will actually save over purchasing individual DVDs.

And, Balsa is a real kick-ass BABE!!!!",1255651200,,608,4.798076923076923
