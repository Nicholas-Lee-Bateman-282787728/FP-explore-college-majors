8422058,5,B004BMIM2G,We love Get Squiggling.  My perfectionist daughter has been watching since she was 4.  The best part of the DVD is being able to pause the video - because she is a perfectionist and it has to LOOK JUST THE SAME!  Drawings are simple but provide a good base and now that she is 5.5 I see how she is using some of the things she learned to make her own figures or combine the characters into new pictures.  Her drawing is also VERY good compared to her age range - and I think that is due to squigglet walking the kids through the drawing.  Fantastic stuff.,1445558400,,555,4.149532710280374
