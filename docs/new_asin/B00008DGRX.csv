7981951,5,B00008DGRX,"Anyone that's a historian of Apollo has already heard about Mark Gray's Spacecraft Films DVD releases. It's a true dream come true for us. For the past thirty years, collectors have had to settle for second generation film kinescopes of the Apollo television transmissions. Spacecraft Films took the time to locate the original two-inch master videotapes of the downlink broadcasts and used those tapes to master these DVD sets. Bravo.",1093910400,,435,5.228571428571429
7981952,5,B00008DGRX,"This collection of disks is published by Spacecraft films, and they deserve much praise.  This particular set chronicles Apollo 16 from training through spash down.  Literally, virutally every second of available footage is included, raw, without commentary.  The launch is covered from multiple angles, and you can use your angle key on your dvd remote to switch between them.
Every lunar EVA is covered from absolute start to finish.  When I say comprehensive, I mean comprehensive...  this set is not a collection of one hour commentaries/documentaries on the space program, but some of America's greatest moments in space recorded and offered for viewing without comment.
Its awe inspiring, really.
Obviously, some of the footage is rough.  Spacecraft films did as much restoration as they could but this is original footage shot with 30 year old equipment by real men.
I bought this particular set as I met Apollo 16 commander John Young once, and I really think he is one of our greatest astronauts.  He flew everything from Gemini to the Space Shuttle (twice, I believe, including the first Shuttle flight) and was Cheif Astronaut for much longer.  Spacecraft's complete downlink dvd sets are a must for any true space historian.  For those of us who grew up with childhood memories of the Apollo missions they are truly incredible!",1046908800,29,1339,5.077625570776256
