Carol Weinshenker, New York",1126137600,2,85,4.666666666666667
2119961,5,B0002TSZNI,"For those of us of a certain age - which probably means anyone past 50, these days - this is an incredible look back on the people, the performances, the to wonderful music and dance that we just don't see enough of in this age of rap and hip-hop (which we know is aimed at a younger crowd, who probably feel as passionate about them as we do about ""our"" kind of entertainment.)  It's a super hour-and-a-half of happy memories.",1124841600,4,427,4.3375
2119962,4,B0002TSZNI,"To begin with, I totally agree with some reviewers that the lip-sinked numbers are a low part of the disc, but even so we watch the people who 'introduced' these classics to the public. I also think Hepburn was Hepburn, and the long dialogue section could - and should! - have been cut. But the sets and the concept of the number were great.

But in general my wife and I had the sensation that ""It's A Pity It Had To End!"" We could have been there for the whole night watching number after number without blinking. Michael Jeter and the cast of Grand Hotel and of course Tommy Tune's concept were incredible. Angela Landsbury and Bea Arthur were marvelous doing one of Jerry Herman's best.

Well, in conclusion, I LOVED this DVD. And we can't wait for BLT 3.",1122595200,4,759,4.414285714285715
2119963,5,B0002TSZNI,"I received the first and second issues of the series the same day, watched both twice. It was wonderful to relive some of the performances I saw on Broadway as well as to see some performances I was not able to see ""live"". There is nothing like the m,agic of live theater and both volumes bring it to you via Toney Awards telecasts. It was nice to see Tom Bosley [ Happy Days, Father Dowling Mysteries, and Murder She Wrote] in his Tomy Award performance as Fiorello Laguardia; Jerry Orbach [Law and Order] in 42nd Street and Chicago, Angela Lansbury [Murder She Wrote] in Mame and Sweeny Todd., and so it goes. THIS IS A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES MUSICAL THEATER. I only hope there is a third edition.",1110585600,8,702,4.407692307692308
2119964,4,B0002TSZNI,"Though there is a little weak material on this DVD, the whole is an item absolutely essential to the Broadway lover's collection. You will replay many of the sequences over and over, like Jeter and Barrett's smashing scene from Grand Hotel (even my musical-disliking friends liked this one), Gregory Hines and his peerless company in Jelly's Last Jam, and Jerry Orbach's turn as Billy Flynn in Chicago. On the other hand, the Coco sequence is long, dull, and forgettable; the girl playing next to Hepburn is incredibly bad, and it's a surprise that someone like her would be on the Broadway stage. I thought the Me and My Girl sequence was also long, dull, and forgettable, with a repetitive song and a dance that seemed less than brilliantly choreographed. I just wish they would ultimately release all the Tony performances; in most cases, these are the only surviving snippets of much classic theatre, and whether they're ""treasures"" or not they're always worth seeing and preserving.",1104710400,3,987,4.987878787878788
2119965,5,B0002TSZNI,If you love musical theater this is an absolute must.  I enjoyed this program even more than the first Broadway's Lost Treasures.  How fortunate we are to have these fantastic performances preserved for us to enjoy.  Buy it!,1102982400,7,224,4.842105263157895
2119966,4,B0002TSZNI,"Once again, I'm grateful for what good we do get in the mix of performances captured in Broadway's Lost Treasures II -- for what is good is quite good.

Among the best are Michael Jeter and Brent Barrett having a ball in ""Grand Hotel,"" Patti LuPone brassily belting in ""Anything Goes,"" Angela Lansbury and Bea Arthur radiating charm and affection in ""Mame,"" Robert Lindsay acting and singing very much like Anthony Newley in ""Me and My Girl,"" and Walter Bobbie and chorus bringing down the house in ""Guys and Dolls.""

But we also get plenty of less-exciting segments, and several once again are lip synched (generally the performers recreating their performances for the 1971 Tony show's retrospective). The latter include Richard Kiley in ""Man of La Mancha"" and Tom Bosley in ""Fiorello."" The whole lifeblood of Broadway is LIVE performance, so these artificial segments should have been left in the vault and more time should have been given to other truly live performances.

The most curious segment is Katherine Hepburn in ""Coco."" In the end, though, it doesn't do much for the reputation of the show -- or Hepburn, for that matter. She can't sing -- that's no surprise -- but she's also unable to immerse herself in the character. You never forget it's Hepburn doing Chanel, and she tends to bellow to be heard across the footlights. Since Hepburn insisted on having this segment pretaped without an audience, we also get a very intrusive laugh track. But for many, Hepburn's star wattage will be enough.

All that said, every Broadway fan needs to have this DVD in his/her collection. And we can only hope that more will be forthcoming.",1101340800,38,1642,4.853571428571429
2119967,4,B0002TSZNI,"I am so happy to see that this sequel is out there. I hope that they keep putting them out over and over. I actaully like this one more than the first. I am crazy about Patty LuPone and she is phenomenal as usual.

This is one to watch again and again.

The only thing I didn't care for much were the interviews, which I found to be very light weight and not adding much to the show. But, that is a small quibble in something so valuable.",1099180800,6,438,3.965909090909091
2119968,5,B0002TSZNI,"Don't get me wrong, vol. 1 was great to see.  But I have some fond memories of the listed numbers, and it's possible this volume might have less star wattage and show familiarity but more polished, enjoyable performances.  The list:

2119969,5,B0002TSZNI,"I really love Broadway Shows.  I was lucky enough to see a few  shows when I visited New York.  I also have seen a few roadshow productions.  It is an awesome DVD.  The shipping on this one was excellent.  I have the first DVD and the now the second.  The third one is on order and I look forward to getting it and having a great time watching it.

If you love Broadway Shows you will surely enjoy these.  They are songs taken from the show and  sure makes me want to buy a lot more shows.  A great way to bring joy and song into the home.",1404086400,,539,3.8981481481481484
2119970,4,B0002TSZNI,"Not quite as good as vols. 1 & 3, but still priceless.  The performances are great,, and are well worth viewing for anyone who loves Broadway shows and could not see them live and as a memory booster for those who did.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1397260800,,244,4.282608695652174
2119971,3,B0002TSZNI,Treasures I and III  set a High level  with the choices of departed LEGENDS...Still  this  Treasures II is  a valuable record of fine performers. Glad to have it.,1386979200,,162,4.642857142857143
2119972,5,B0002TSZNI,"The video clips were great.  I wish there were more to have been seen.  I love Broadway plays, especially the ones prior to 2000, and these were a good sample.",1352592000,,159,4.266666666666667
2119973,4,B0002TSZNI,"I purchased this DVD specifically to see and have a copy of the late, great Gregory Hines' performance in ""Jelly's Last Jam"".  While I found the camera work on that number, which was captured at a Tony Awards show,to be frustrating--as it moved several times during Mr. Hines' actual dancing to (inexplicably) capture expressions on the faces of other cast members, thereby missing the true artistry that was unfolding courtesy of Mr. Hines' dancing--at least part of the performance is preserved for posterity.  However, I was rewarded with other performance gems I wouldn't have otherwise seen, including the incomparable Katherine Hepburn as Coco Chanel.  If you enjoy Broadway musicals, the clips contained herein are worth seeing/having.",1236902400,,742,5.379310344827586
2119974,5,B0002TSZNI,"As a former New Yorker, the Broadway musical has always been my first love.  I don't get to NY anymore and as much as I miss my friends, I have to say I miss Broadway just as much as I miss them.

I have seen almost all of the shows on this DVD, and I had chills and was brought to tears by 90% of it.

To those who didn't like some of the numbers, there are ways to skip through a DVD. LOL

If you love Broadway Musicals, the great old ones, this is a major treat!",1217721600,,465,3.7142857142857144

2119976,4,B0002TSZNI,"If you're interested in the history of Broadway musicals, this DVD is a good start.  However, it just covers the top-selling shows and does not delve too deeply.",1153094400,,161,4.75
2119977,4,B0002TSZNI,"As a musical theatre lover I've seen a lot of footage from various tony's & concerts, but this was delightful!  The wide range of preformances and preformers are just great!  I'd get this based only on the fact that it has Patti LuPone doing Anthing Goes on it!  :)  Also, the selections from Jelly's Last Jam & Chicago are just great!  Enjoy!  (and if you haven't seen the first Lost treasures DVD, treat yourself to that!)",1138665600,6,424,4.5131578947368425
2119978,4,B0002TSZNI,"When I first found the Broadway Lost Treasure Serier on Amazon, I nearly jumped up and down in my seat. Any Broadway clips that I can get a hold of I definitly must get. I bought Broadway Lost Treasure I and Broadway Lost Treasures II together. I must say the performances were very good, just because you can't call broadway bad. The way the performances were put together, however, was boring and gave off cheaply made vibes. Dont get me wrong the hosts were fantastic(Jerry Orbach,Angela Lansbery.etc)some of my favorite people, but I wanted I little bit more background information on the shows and things like that.

Overall, I encourage purchasing Broadway Lost Treasures II(and the first one),if you keep an open mind. If you don't know alot about broadway, then this will bore you to tears. This is not what you should purchase if you want to learn more about broadway. If you are more interested in learning more about broadway, rather than just seeing performances, then I would buy ""Broadway: The American Musical"" (which can be found on Amazon).",1135209600,,1057,4.8397790055248615
