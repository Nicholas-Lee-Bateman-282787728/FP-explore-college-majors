Worth watching.",1468540800,,134,4.583333333333333
3630516,3,B001HM2CBU,Not a bad little movie and loosely done about an actually Bear attack in Japan.  At times it is a little slow and there are some really cheesy bear attack scenes.  On the hole not a bad flick.  FYI not for the faint of heart.  My wife was turning her head in some of the scenes.,1439856000,,278,3.9107142857142856

8308913,5,B001HM2CBU,"For his 1990 directorial debut, Sonny Chiba displays remarkable skill, deftly weaving a romance and familial drama into his animal amok story. His film also benefits from some wonderful visuals, from bleak snowy landscapes, to beautiful sunsets, to blood drenched cabins. Performances are convincing throughout, with relative newcomer Muramatsu more than keeping up with the more experienced Hiroyuki Sanada, who plays Yuki's love interest Eiji.

Where the movie does stumble badly is with its bear. Actually, it's less of a stumble, and more of a head-first fall off the edge of a mountain. Wherever possible, footage of a real bear is used, but all too often Chiba is forced to resort to a stand-in, a man in a really unconvincing bear costume, which is hard to take seriously. If only they had found a more realistic solution to the bear problem, I suspect that the film might have been better received.

6/10. Worth watching to see just how bad the fake bear is, and for cutie Muramatsu stripping down to a skimpy outfit to lure the creature to its doom.",1523923200,,1058,4.872222222222222
8308914,2,B001HM2CBU,"Rather silly mostly, but entertaining in the same way old Godzilla movies can be at moments. Instead of an entire city destroyed, it's more on the scale of a small village house or two. The attack scenes are on par with the acting, which range from ridiculous to somewhat hilarious. Sort of funny how the bear can be at the door, then the window, then up on the roof all in the span of 15 seconds. Really super bear? He's quick. He's magical. Especially noteworthy because the head of the bear suit often falls askew to one side in the various kerfuffles, must be hard to see what he's mauling at times. In summary, everybody was kung fu fighting a bear suit.",1518652800,,659,4.409836065573771
8308915,4,B001HM2CBU,"Think Godzilla with hair. Marauding, woman-eating bear is terrorizing villages. A small gang of bear-hunters are out to get rid of this pest. Young woman looses her father to the bear and vows revenge. This movie has terror (mild), love, bravery and honor and a very nice dog. Like many older, less expensive Japanese films, the shift between scenes is not always smooth. Like Godzilla, the ""killer"" bear is not that realistic.  There are shots of a real bear; unfortunately he does not much resemble the killer except that they both have black fur.  I give it 4 starts, but I liked the acting, the story is based on fact and is easily understood, scenery is beautiful ( if not always filmed well) and in the end good wins out.  One of the previous reviewers warned about gore/blood. I found it very well handled and nothing compared to what we see in war movie or gang videos today.  Bears are not the neatest of eaters after all.  If you like adventure and heroes, I think this movie is worth your while.",1513900800,,1006,4.535911602209945
