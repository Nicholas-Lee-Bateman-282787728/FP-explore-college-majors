5613486,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"So like I said, the season only has 5 episodes plus the new Africa Special so I guess you can say it's really 6 but still; I wish it had been longer. The season has all your ""normal"" Top Gear road tests, drag races, incredible cars and of course that dark-sublime-hilarious jokes we all love. Like the other person in the reviews said, this is not censored when it comes to words which I personally found a bit shocking after the first ""s##t!"" and several ""F-word"" variations but I mean, Family Guy does/say stuff way more insuitable. All in all I loved the season and I know you will too! My only, and I really mean only, complain is that for some dumb reason the BBC does not want to release their new TG in Blu-Ray. Top Gear is a very visual show with dynamic colors on cars, beautiful landscapes, incredible viewing/racing angles and yet we can't enjoy it in amazing BR. I don't see why they do this, but is not enough for me to give this anything less than 5-stars. Again, I loved this season and did not had any issues with delivery since it was in my mailbox in 3 days normal shipping.",1369872000,3,1092,4.305825242718447
5613487,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"Typical Top Gear shenanigans. Funny, entertaining, informative. My young daughter loves them too. This particular series, they stopped bleeping the profanity. Jeremy Clarkson drops the f-bomb 3 times in the Africa special! Wasn't expecting that. So parents beware.
ALSO, they changed the studio videography. Its gone all herky-jerky. Not sure if its a style thing or a technical problem.",1369699200,13,387,5.576271186440678
5613488,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"If you love the BBC Top Gear show, then you won't want to miss out on this season.  It contains everything you have come to expect from this trio, snark, fast cars, and wonderfully funny trips and road races.",1369699200,,208,4.333333333333333
5613489,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"I've been a huge fan of TG ever since I first discovered it while wandering around Youtube.  Richard's youthful cheer, Jeremy's daft enthusiasm, and James' very Britishly cool demeanor add up to a combination that would be virtually impossible to replicate.

Thank God no one has tried.  Top Gear America notwithstanding, Top Gear is perhaps the best unscripted comedy you can find.  To tinker with this formula would be to ruin it in short order.  The chemistry between the three presenters is really what makes this show good.

My main complaint with Top Gear is that the series are so short.  There are a few episodes, then nothing...then a few episodes, then nothing...lather, rinse, repeat.  It drives me bonkers.  I think there are approximately as many shows in a calendar year as we get here in the States, but it's so far outside of my experience I just can't get the hang of it.  How many shows this time?  Seven, I think.  I'm only halfway through the second disc so I'm not certain.  But they'll all be excellent, that much I know.",1369008000,2,1043,4.664835164835165

5613510,3,B00BF5CTWQ,"After waiting soooo long for this season, it was quite a disappointment.
I think that covering the Pole, Great Britain, Europe, VietNam, America,
South America etc. they have run out of a special place to go :(",1391212800,,210,4.702702702702703
5613511,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"I don't really even care about cars all that much, but these three gentlemen (as well as The Stig) put on one of the most entertaining programs I've ever seen. Can't wait for series 20 to be released.",1389484800,,200,4.2894736842105265
5613512,4,B00BF5CTWQ,"I have loved Top Gear (UK) since finding them back in season two or three. They still have great adventures, drive wonderful cars, say and do hilarious things. I do note an overall tiredness among them, no huge surprise after 20 years. I do understand, being about the same age as the presenters.  I would imagine that after so many years, it would be difficult to avoid becoming a parody of yourself; or to find a new challenge that has not been done; or find a new, exciting comment to say about the 100th super car you have test driven that year. After all this commentary, I still love the show and have pre-ordered Top Gear 20.",1389052800,,632,4.401709401709402
5613513,2,B00BF5CTWQ,More of the same and predictable jokes and test method.  I'm a car enthusiast but I'm yawning due to lack of fresh ideas,1388534400,,120,4.217391304347826

5613515,4,B00BF5CTWQ,"I love Top Gear, I'm a huge fan but this season it just seems like the presenters, especially Jeremy Clarkson weren't really enjoying what they where doing.. Like the African special really seems like it was forced, i hate to admit but it was by far the least interesting special they ever had. I hope season 20 and 21 goes back to the old top gear way of three immature men having a lot of fun and talking about cars. The way i see it season 18 was the last great season. I fully enjoyed it and had a lot of fun watching it.",1386720000,,525,4.0576923076923075

5613518,5,B00BF5CTWQ,My favortie top gear adventure was in this series. Great humor and obviously the legendary jeremy clarkson commentary is always great. Definatly in my top 3 best seasons of top gear pick list.,1384905600,,192,4.848484848484849

5613520,5,B00BF5CTWQ,I love all of the Top Gear Series.  Great laughs and very entertaining. The boys get up to some crazy stuff as usual and there are some fantastic expensive cars to have a drool over.,1377302400,2,182,4.2
5613521,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"Once again, I can't say anything bad about this series.  However, it is kinda sad to see Jeremy and James getting heavier and older and knowing that it's the the beginning of the end to the best series ever.",1376438400,,207,4.3076923076923075
5613522,4,B00BF5CTWQ,"My only disappointment with season 19 is there are no special features on the DVD release. Given the lack of extras and how few episodes there are, they could have easily condensed it to two discs. Otherwise, it's the same great Top Gear.",1375747200,5,238,4.558139534883721
5613523,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"If you have never watched any of these shows this is a great season to capture your interest.  Not to be confused with the American version which in Amazon terms is worthy of only about 2 stars.  I own all published seasons from 10 through 19 and would own every season but as of yet 1-9 is not produced in a dvd format.  This is a great, great show to sit down and get a few laughs from but also to check out awesome cars that most people will never even see on the road much less own.",1375660800,,486,3.938775510204082
5613524,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"As the title states, this is another great season of Top Gear.  The car for old people and the Africa special are my favorites.  Recommended.",1375056000,2,141,4.6
5613525,5,B00BF5CTWQ,Still going strong. Great collection of 'stars in a reasonably priced car'. James May finally get to shine a few times.,1374537600,,119,4.714285714285714

5613527,5,B00BF5CTWQ,I can watch these guys all day.  Way better than the American version.  The Africa challenge trip was good although not quite as epic as other adventures they've done.  Still love to have these on DVD.,1374192000,,201,4.527777777777778

5613530,5,B00BF5CTWQ,The Top Gear boys continue to show what so great about cars. People who don't know how to drive you are missing a great adventure,1372636800,2,129,4.2

5613533,5,B00BF5CTWQ,love top gear it's the best show on tv right now and I bought the dvd set as a gift,1371686400,2,83,3.2
5613534,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"I was quite surprised at the content on this DVD.  I became a Top Gear fan in 2012, and up until this year have only been able to view the BBC America and/or Netflix (which I think are from BBC America) broadcasts of the show.  For Series 19, I was able to view the BBC broadcast before I saw the BBC America showing.  Of course I knew there were differences between the two, but I was able to see for myself what those differences were.  Nothing major, just little ""small moments"" that really didn't move the show forward but were still fun to watch.  What surprised me on this DVD was that some of the ""small moments"" that weren't shown on the BBC America version are actually on the DVD.  Yay!  A word of warning, though.  If you're easily offended by language, get ready to cover your ears.  The ""F"" bomb is dropped a few times, surprisingly.  Overall, I love this DVD.",1371600000,5,873,4.333333333333333
5613535,5,B00BF5CTWQ,The nineteenth season was terrific just like it was expected to. Had some really awesome cars as well as British humou. Just a great season,1371254400,,139,4.6
5613536,5,B00BF5CTWQ,This show is the best on tv or dvd.  I did find them on You tub first.  After that I started getting there dvds.  You will not go wrong for doing so. Thanks Top Gear,1371168000,2,165,3.657142857142857
5613537,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"Yet another great series. Jeremy and the P-45 alone are worth the purchase in itself, the car-rugby bit was also priceless.",1370995200,,123,4.904761904761905

5613539,3,B00BF5CTWQ,"Having been spoiled by the hilarious past series, #19 was a bit of a diappointment.  It had a few good moments on the trip in Africa, but mostly it was a rehash of previous pranks, races and interviews.  I waited for months for this series to be released and was left hanging I'm afraid.",1370649600,2,287,4.296296296296297
8567627,5,B00BF5CTWQ,Great for anyone who misses watching the old Top Gear,1520035200,,53,4.4
8567628,5,B00BF5CTWQ,"Season 19 of Top Gear only lasts 5 episodes before the Africa Special. But it is well worth the money--classic segments abound, from Richard Hammond's review of the Pagani Huyara supercar and James May's and Jeremy Clarkson's rugby match with Kias (proving Kias are tougher than believed) to mini-epics like the Nevada-to-the border trip and the race from Wembley to Milan. It wraps up with one of their best epics, the two-part search for the source of the River Nile.

A warning--they stopped bleeping the guys in this one, so virgin ears will get an earful. Overall, though, this short season ranks among their best.",1511308800,,619,4.895238095238096
