2313902,4,B0009RQRXI,"Dokkoida is a great action hero parody . Suzuo , not the brightest young man to walk the planet , returns to town to find employment. Unable to do so he takes a job from adorable Tanpopo , thinking its a cosplay gig for store openings , inadvertently becoming the tester of a new crime fighting suit.
  Dokkoida is really amusing with an oddball cast;
Dokkoida/Suzuo the dim but big hearted hero.
Tanpopo/ Kosuzu  his sidekick and company rep.
Dr. Marronflower the evil genius with a video game addiction.
Mistress Hyacinth a class A criminal dominatrix and her slave Pierre.
Edelweis a child villain , who looks more like a magical girl.
Neuroloid Girl the beer guzzling frat girl and rival company suit tester.
  Dokkoida isn't a perfect series, some episodes fall a little flat while others make up for it with their hilarity. So in a nutshell I'd give Dokkoida a thumbs up, especially right now when you can get the complete series for under $10 , that's less than a buck an episode. You get the complete boxed set 3 decals , reversible art covers and extras include a live version of the great opening theme and making of the awesome stop-motion closing sequence. You should pick this one up , at this price you can't go wrong.",1279497600,,1232,4.581818181818182
2313903,3,B0009RQRXI,"L/R - 6/10

This series tried so hard to be smart and cool, yet only managed to be confusing and mildly entertaining. The pacing was off right from the word go because it opened with a bland episode involving the spy duo stopping an old man selling a fake item connected to the the royal family, the reason being to avoid bringing shame on the royalty of Ishtar - a country modeled on the UK, the exciting country where every spy lives, as all James Bond fans know. Not exactly the best way to kick-off what I had expected to be a flashy and fun little series.

The people in charge really did think they were making something stylish. An example is that whenever possible, one of the spy duo gets asked which of the two is L and which is R, and the question is always avoided. Who gives a damn? Why should the viewers care about the initial a pair of underdeveloped characters go by? Instead of throwing in lines like those, dialogue of significance should've been put in.

When the series wasn't focusing on episodic stuff of no importance whatsoever, the main plot was busy letting me down. It was never clear exactly what was going on because the episodes tended to start after the point where explanations should've been inserted, but the basic jist of it was this (spoilers): a 15 year old princess had lived her life not knowing about herself, she finds out, she reveals that her father (the prince) hadn't tried to kill his brother when she makes a speech to the public, she fakes her death under overly dramaric circumstances...and the series ended. It could've been decent but the confusion caused by the lack of explanations and the way the good guys fooled the public into thinking the baddies had tried to kill her (a mask) ruined it. Attempts and adding depth by making a simple story confusing never work out too well.

The worst part of the series? The lack of any character development. Near to nothing was revealed about the spy duo - not even one flashback was used to add depth. Plenty of time was wasted on pointless one-shot stories, yet no episodes could be spared for the unimportant business of getting viewers to care about the main characters. It was like watching Cowboy Bebop without understanding the reasoning behind Spike's almost arrogrant looking smile.

Overall, not a great series. It's something anime fans shouldn't go out of their way to watch. If you're looking for a series with lots of exciting action (not L/R) and SOME character development (not L/R), go for Black Lagoon instead. At least you'd have some hot pants and a tight arse to look at if you watched that instead!",1245283200,,2616,4.605150214592275
2313904,2,B0009RQRXI,"Licensed By Royalty is a decent but mediocre watch.  May not be recommended for purchase.  Probably a rental.  It doesn't use really great animation and character development is pretty weak for everyone, even the main characters Jack and Rowe.  Jack and Rowe combine James Bond with Jin and Mugen from Samurai Champloo - a bit too slick and a bit too much foreknowledge-like planning.  The music was pleasant to listen to but nothing really outstanding.  There's a light hearted feel to the music and often times, played at completely inappropriate times.

The climax of the story builds too quickly.  This is largely due to the 13 episode length and the sitcom nature of most of the episodes.  There definitely isn't a lot of time to care, nor dramatic tension built up, so when things really get moving, it's not really dramatic and of course they play happy music inappropriately.

My two chief complaints are not that the animation was bad or that the series was too short or the music wasn't done right.  My first complaint is that although extensive use of British accents were used, no one actually spoke British English.  The accents are probably what Americans and a lot of people think British sounds.  There's a decided lack of British slang which should be much more common.  And the accents are too smooth.  The second chief complaint is that there is far too much planning and prophetic foreknowledge.  L/R somehow always have the right tools and people to pull off all their escapades.  It's annoying.  You can see this extensive planning in the end.  They attempted a somewhat Cowboy Bebop level of drama which was very out of place with the rest of episodes, though it shared completely inappropriate music with them.  You understand this overuse of planning when you consider how excessively smoke is used in the series.",1204156800,2,1838,4.84887459807074

2313911,5,B0009RQRXI,"This is a review of the blu ray collection, not the show.  The show is incredible, enough said.  This specific collection is a foreign import and like many I was a little skeptical about ordering for fear it would be in the wrong language or wouldnt work in my blu ray player due to region coding.  I was pleasantly mistaken as this collection is exactly what i have always wanted and at an unbeatable price.  The collection includes all 4 seasons in single standard blu ray cases as the picture shows, as well as the final stand alone feature film ""The Final Break"" all packed in a nice cardboard sleeve.  The ONLY thing that i could tell that would make this look different than anything you could buy off a shelf in a store in the US is the region code/rating logo on the front of each package (not a big deal).  The cover art is different from the US versions but not bad.  The price for this cant be beat, $80 for all 4 seasons and the stand alone film.  Each season (if you can find them in store) will run anywhere between $15-20 for just DVD.  Not all the seasons were released on blu ray in the US so this is about the only way to get them all in that format and they look and sound incredible.  They played instantly with default language of English, menues are all in English.  Like I said before, the only way you could tell this wasn't purchased in a store in the US is the region code/rating logo and the different cover art.",1390694400,10,1439,4.2536764705882355

2313918,5,B0009RQRXI,"This series is more than a series since the episodes are not in any way autonomous. They all follow one another, the seasons too, with only one story line from the beginning to the end. And you will definitely be moved to deep emotions by the last extra episode, the Final Break. And altogether it lasts some fifty-eight hours of intense breath-taking and disbelief suspending action. The very first lesson is that you must not fool with a civil engineer and attack his brother, even if this brother is not his real brother. It is all in the head and luckily it is, otherwise neither Michael nor Lincoln would have made it to the end of the first season since they had against them their own mother, a power-hungry anti-maternal harpy who is ready to have any of her sons killed or even to kill them herself, slowly if possible because she finds it funny to see them losing their last drops of blood.

But the film is not so much about breaking out of prison but breaking out of servitude and build up your freedom along with the freedom of the whole world. The prison or prisons is or are a metaphor, better a parable of our total enslavement to some kind of order that is far, far beyond our consciousness, not to speak of control. And this battle is triggered by one elder son, who is not a brain but is a brute, who is fooled into going out to kill someone but that is a framing operation and he does not kill, but is found guilty and sent to the electric chair in Chicago in the now famous prison of Fox River, the well named since we are going to discover a prison is nothing but a whole colony of hundreds of foxes, and no vixens at all. Except the doctor and the main nurse. Some of these prison officers are of course rotten and they sell; to influential prisoners the various services that they should control, like the appointment of the prisoners on the working details. Some can even be thieves and steal the property of the prisoners that is kept ""safe"" in some kind of closed cloakroom. Prison safety is not exactly safety for the prisoners and their property.

So the series describes all kinds of dependence and imprisonment. The first one is a prison universe with its warden, then its prison officers and various guards and its medical personnel. This is already a hierarchy that has its rules and its alienations. Then you have the prisoners and there too you have a hierarchy. The plain inmates, and then those who have the favor of being considered as able to work in the prison on various tasks for a real pittance, but for something. But the control of such positions is bought up by one prisoner, in our case a mafia higher-up, and he chooses who he wants to be the members of this team. There are also teams working in the kitchen and in the laundry and other general services of the prison. And next to this hierarchy you have another one that is racial, not so much a hierarchy than an apartheid system that cuts the population into the whites and the blacks, or at least the too big groups of people protected by the white and the black main inmates, self appointed of course, at least on the basis of their outside connections, I mean criminal connections. And then you have those who are not under protection on either side, the non-mentionable who can keep their heads low and remain unseen, and as long as they remain invisible they will have no problems.

The last thing to say about such a world, the prison world is that small criminals are of course mixed with major criminals and that is bad, very bad indeed. The small criminals will be afraid from the very start and they will accept some protection in exchange of some petty services. They become the petty slaves of these protectors and there you have the sexual perverts who only want some young flesh for their personal service. Then you have the real criminal minds who organize networks to control the prisoners, and even, when they can, the prison itself. A prison is a college, if not a university, post-graduate studies if you please, for criminals and that education is paid by the state free of charge, full board and pension included.

The prison SONA in Panama is not different from the Fox River Federal Prison in Chicago. All prisons are the same. It is their very nature, at least the very nature the series wants you to think of and ponder about. Of course there are different sides that are not shown: the fact that there is a library and that you can get some real education within the prison and also some prisoners lend their knowledge to the others and even do some research to know more and be more helpful to their fellow inmates.

The second level the series wants you to think about is justice, and there the picture is bleak indeed. If by any chance you do not have the best lawyer and the best defense funds for your first trial you can do and try what you want afterwards you will never get through and you might, today in some states only, escape the death penalty but be in prison for ever. Think of Mumia Abu Jamal, and he is not the only one. In the reverse case you can literally buy yourself the best just and equal justice you can if you can bring experts in and pay for DNA tests and so on. The police will not try to get to the bottom of a case if they have an easy solution on their platter. The police is the easiest institution to manipulate with the easiest people to influence you can imagine. They only run after real evidence in series and in very special cases. Everyone is not DSK with all the political leverage behind such a case. Then there is only one choice: to dream till you die, or to escape and run till you die.

But very fast the series gets what is at first an undertone to the level of the major plot. Our global world is under the menace of some ""company"" that is secret and possesses a tremendous amount of scientific knowledge that is both positive in the civilian field and deadly or lethal in its military applications. And there are in this world a lot of people who would like to control that technical and scientific knowledge to sell it to potential war-mongers or war-minded politicians or dictators to have some fun in this very dull world indeed. That's always the basic debate with science. In hard science like mathematics and physics the constant choice is between military apps and civilian apps, and military apps are bringing in some profit a lot faster than civilian apps. But think of the medical field and the famous and frightening nanobots that will cost a fortune and that will give such an advantage in life span and physical or mental means to those who will have them in their blood and brain. They will not forget that these nanobots can communicate within each individual, but, and they will forget this, also within a certain spatial area (like GPSs and smart phones) and particularly to the main motherboard controlled by a few people, I mean very few people, like the six card holders of the ""company"" in this series. Those who will have the nanobots in their blood and brain will become the real aristocracy of the world and take the control of the planet and the cosmos but will be controlled by half a dozen people at an even higher level. And this totalitarian ideology is coming under the disguise of an MIT professor. Never mind which one. There will always be a mad scientist to plan such projects.

But do not think humanities are not concerned. They are working a lot today on human sciences like sociology, psychology, even psychiatry to find the proper genetic ways to control the DNA of people, to change it if necessary, and also to control the minds and the behaviors of people with plain old manipulation, brain washing and other hypnotic techniques. Any totalitarian leader or party will find the way to mesmerize people, to control people with propaganda or with some drugs or products including in your food or drinks. Think how easily they make you addicted to caffeine, to energetic drinks, cola drinks or alcohol, not to speak of tobacco. They are ready to use any ideology to achieve their objectives and particularly religious ideologies and absolutely no religion is immune because the basic objective of a religion is to bring people together and make them think and feel and respond to the world collectively along one single line. God made you free to choose the truth and in all religions there is only one God's truth.

The series thus becomes political science fiction at first and then plain science fiction after the political intrigue is pushed aside with the resignation of the Vice President who had become President with some poisonous drink enhancement for the elected President and who was behind the framing of Lincoln Burrows, as a faithful beneficiary of the ""company"". This science fiction is of course nothing but science fiction and in that case it is not a utopia at all, but a real full and absolute dystopia, at least till the last episode and the Final Break.

The last and essential dimension of this series is a study in loyalty, not allegiance which is not always rational, but loyalty. There are three types of loyalties. First the loyalty to the ""company"" and this one is nearly easy to counter: let them shoot the first bullet and then shoot them all down. And if you can capture one or two try to get into some exchange of arguments, even striking arguments if necessary, to make them change allegiances and then loyalties. But then you have the official services that are supposed to enforce the law, security services and justice. Both are supposed to develop a rational loyalty to the country, the fatherland, the motherland, the constitution, or whatever charter or declaration of universal human and civil rights. But how can you recognize at the bottom of the institution or outside that the order given to you is respectful of such principles, and such orders can come from a long may up the ladder of authority and if my boss tells me something he must have his good reasons to do so, and I have to obey, don't I? And then think within the frame of local police, state police, FBI, Homeland Security, Secret Services, Presidential Security and many others and you have the full picture. Think within the frame of elected officials of the police, justice, judicial administration, justice department, etc. Good luck at surviving in that maze.

But the main loyalty is the loyalty you owe to those who have helped you in a difficult situation, those who have been your associates in some ethical project, even if it is to escape from a prison. And this loyalty is of course all the more powerful if we are speaking family. This started in 2005 like Supernatural and in both cases you have two brothers, the elder one less brainy, the younger one brainier, with a mother that disappeared in their young age. They are not real brothers, be it only because they family names are not the same, but they were raised together and after the disappearance of their mother, and later father, the elder one takes care of the younger one and even puts him through college and university to the level of engineer. But his means were not always very swift and they were often criminal. Those two brothers who are not brothers and yet are brothers have no mother till very late in the series and the mother is such a caricature that they can only deny her motherhood that she refuses anyway and what's more they do not have no father any more, though he makes a quick come back to disappear by falling on a bullet. The two series are so similar along that family line that there must have been some leak from the one to the other. But Prison Break is one story line and one plot, not episodes that have little to do with one another and a rather loose general line. Of course Prison Break has to come to an end, whereas Supernatural can last forever. The two brothers are Michael and Lincoln, just like the two brothers in Supernatural are supposed to be the vessels of archangel Michael and Lucifer. The parallel between Lincoln and Lucifer is of course hilarious but not gratuitous. Lincoln the liberator of the Blacks, Lucifer the liberator of the Apocalypse, of the human species once and for all, or till the next whimsical caprice of God who could recreate his imperfect creation a second time in a few eons.

And the last episode is discreet about the death of Michael with one blood drop and a few light headaches, and then we skip four years and discover his son and Sara his wife but no father coming on his tomb with Alex, Sucre and Lincoln for some anniversary in some Central American country. The Final Break episode explains what happened and that episode is so phenomenally emotional with the post-mortem video message from Michael explaining why is not here any more. Absolutely beautiful. But also very Christian. The liberty of all and the punishment of the real criminal minds can only come through the sacrifice of one member of the team and the flight as fast and as far as possible of the only one that is menaced still, Sara, the Mary Magdalene of this modern Christ. Michael Scofield, MS in civil engineering, has to be sacrificed with his superior knowledge and intelligence. We will regret that in the final episode Lincoln's son is not brought back on his uncle's tomb with the rest of the family that includes Alex and Sucre who are not really members of the family.

A brilliant experience.

Those of us with 5.1 surround systems will receive complaints from others in the house not watching the show about the incessant bass line. I suppose if you could watch only one episode per week, this would go unnoticed. In that same vein, the little cut-to-commercial blurb also gets quite annoying.

2313935,3,B0009RQRXI,"Prison Break is/was a great TV show and if you have not seen it, then you should. This is one of the best TV shows to air on TV. Great cast, everyone can act. I will not spoil it in any way by talking about the plot (do they ever get out etc.), i advise you buy it and watch it, the production values are extremely high with Hollywood people like Director/Producer Brett Ratner (Rush Hour / X-Men: The Last Stand).

Crystal clear Blu Ray, on a large LED TV it looks impeccable.

Sadly though, this box-set, is not well priced.

Try this one instead, it is from France, but it is Region Free and it default to English for both Audio and menus.

When I originally watched this TV series when it aired I could hardly wait each week for the next episode to come on. This is a high quality blu-ray set. Plus it comes with an extra episode that didn't air on TV. I've watched this series several times. It never gets boring. Just as a side note, I ordered my blu-ray set directly from Amazon's French website. The price with shipping was less than half of what it is here.

2313940,1,B0009RQRXI,"I purchased this item really looking forward to getting the complete set on blu-ray since it is not offered in the United States.  My item arrived beautifully packaged with both the box and discs labeled ""blu-ray"".  However, when I took out a disc, the edges of it were rough like a standard dvd (blu-ray discs have smoother edges).  I then put the disc in my blu-ray player and played it on my hi-def television.  The picture also looked like a standard dvd.  Just to be sure, I then took the disc and put it in my desktop computer which DOES NOT play blu-ray movies.  It played perfectly.  Finally I took the disc and popped it in a standard dvd player which also does not play blu-ray movies.  Again, it played perfectly.  Conclusion:  These are not blu-ray discs as advertised.  At least the set I received wasn't.  They are standard dvd's that will play on any standard dvd player.  If you order this item, make sure you confirm for yourself that these are blu-rays upon receiving them.  I was disappointed.",1323648000,24,1012,4.581005586592179

2313943,5,B0009RQRXI,"Prison Break Complete Series Blu-ray Review

Distributor - 20th Century Fox  - France

This will be the first Blu review for a television series.

First things first then, this set contains each and every episode from every season of Prison Break. From the Pilot episode, through seasons 1-4 and the Final Break epilogue episode, it's all included here in this set which is available as an import from France.

The set comes together in a square cardboard box which then lifts up to find a total of 10 Blu-ray cases housed inside. Season 1 is presented in the thicker type case which contains 6 discs inside and the rest of the series and final break episode are contained in the thinner type 14mm cases which hold approx 2 discs each.

As for the episodes themselves, although this is a French release, the episodes start from the main menu instantly playing with the English soundtrack and with no subtitles on display. This is a welcome surprise for UK buyers, as a lot of French releases come with burned in French subtitles so it was pleasing to see that this was not the case here.

Anyway, the episodes look fantastic, presented in a quality 16x9 1080p anamorphic transfer, there is no print damage on display and they really look brand new, which seeing as how the series is only a few years old, should really be expected after all.

The audio offered here is English 5.1 and DTS and also a French 5.1 audio option. The English 5.1 audio track sounds crisp and clear and is of a very high and clean quality.

For extra features we are given various commentaries,documentaries and making of features throughout the set.

As far as region coding is concerned Seasons 2 - 4 and the Final Break are all listed as region A,B & C while strangely Season 1 is listed as B only. I did try Season 1 in my dedicated US Blu-ray player and it played without a problem, so make of that what you will.

Ultimately the best thing about this release is not actually the picture, audio or extras, quite honestly it has to be the price. Up until now only Seasons 1, 3 and the Final Break have been released on Blu- ray in the United States or in the UK and they are not the cheapest of releases. This box set which in addition contains 2  more full seasons than the separate releases, at the time of writing cost a total of 81 delivered to the UK from Amazon France. This is a fraction of the price on the separate releases and best of all you do not have the uncomfortable wait that you would have otherwise had, for the eventual releases of Seasons 2 and 4.

Admittedly Season 1 is the main one to own in this series, however for the price here, it is worth having the complete box set, which is all the Prison Break you will ever need and really is the last word on this already classic show.

I cannot see this set ever being bettered and even if a similar box set is eventually released in the UK or US, it will be a while before it is this cheap.

For the Prison Break fan, this set is an essential purchase, for fans of television series in general, you can do a lot worse than this series with the first (and best) season, being some of the best television drama for many years.
Ok, so the follow up seasons were not in the same league as the first and at certain times did tend to stray a little over the top, however do yourself a favour revisit this series and remember how good  it was when it all began. At this price for a complete series which is excellently presented and with  decent extras, you really can't go wrong.

Return once again to Fox River State Penitentiary for a quality TV drama, which will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat from the very first episode.

2313944,5,B0009RQRXI,"The quality of the entire boxed set is excellent. It made the purchase of my Blu-Ray player worth it. I had no problem viewing this region free version. The product arrived in excellent shape & well packaged. I missed this show when it was first aired & started watching the reruns on DirecTV and was totally hooked. I ordered the series when I got tired of only being able to watch 2 episodes a day which is how they were aired. If you can get over the credibility of the initial concept & just suspend belief & go with the flow I think you'll find this was, in my opinion, one of the best series ever on TV. One word of caution when viewing the final episode stop it at the point of ""4 years later"", then watch the ""Final Break"" episode. Then continue viewing the final ""regular"" episode. It will make the end clearer & make more sense.",1289606400,6,838,4.276729559748428
