8200672,3,B000RGX0J0,"Some reviews just reflect the ignorance of the reviewer. Which is, I suppose, to be expected when amateurs are writing them.

One of the reviews here mentions that it has a cast of prominent ""B actors""

By this they mean Academy Award winning actors like
Martin Landau and Christopher Plummer.

Then there's Chris Lemmon. ""As an action hero?"" some say. ""Then you're in trouble.""
Are we, though? He's done it before.
In the film THUNDER IN PARADISE (1993)
Reprising his role from the film in the TV series of the same name: in 1994 and in the two sequels 1994 and 1995 (also providing his voice for the game in that same year).
In 1997 he showed up in the first entry of what became a fairly popular franchise ""Wishmaster"".

No this is a pretty decent series of A and A-minus actors to start us off.

The story is a little hokey by today's standards I suppose. Redemption stories kind of always were. In this case Lemmon's job is first to destroy Ivan ""The Cyborg"" but changes when he discovers that Ivan was once human and is beginning to remember his humanity.
Yeah, I know. Hokey as hell, right?

And the special effects...pretty bad by the standards of 2018. And not great, given that this film came out the same year as TERMINATOR 2.
But not every film gets greenlighted for the kind of budget James Cameron gets handed.
TERMINATOR 2 had a budget of $102,000,000
FIREHEAD had one of...well, let's just say a LOT less.

And when you have almost no budget you do what you can (especially as actors) and sort of hope for the best.
(Compare the performances in 1957's THE GIANT CLAW with the special effects and you'll see what I mean<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Giant-Claw/dp/B0001DA0UG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Giant Claw</a>

Taking all this into consideration. The film has some pretty good action, and acting, and even a few thrills.
Not a classic but certainly okay.",1516492800,,1923,4.877300613496932
8200673,2,B000RGX0J0,"This is one of those hokey movies put out by the Shadow Government.  This is to make anyone that any one that talks about the puppeteers that manipulate the public into going to war or or increasing the defense budget, false flag attacks, erroneous news reporting, anything to feed the propaganda machine. There are small groups of men that rely operate like this, there are not men that blow you up with there eyes.  This movie was intentionally poorly acted, with a content so hokey that any one who speaks about such organisations appear to look like some lunatic who saw this movie.  If you remove the hokey crap this does reflect reality.",1512345600,,643,4.672566371681416
8200674,2,B000RGX0J0,"Firehead is a strange movie that feels like it was made as old fashioned family fair for a direct to VHS release but is randomly peppered with F words making it automatically HBO material. It's hilarious. I got no clue who made the movie or who they were making it for. I do know that it involved Christopher Plummer not washing his hands after he pee-ed (is that how you spell that? No clue here) and a bizarre few performances by actors that I've probably seen in TV reruns repeated. It's pretty funny. One guy does a weird James Cagney impersonation. The other guy does a Russian impersonation that involves being big and scowling all day. Oh and one lady does a poor impersonation of being a sexy femme fatale and comes off more as a weird pervy librarian but sadly not in a cool way.

I can't really recommend this. It's not good. I got some decent laughs but it's not good. It's not what I'd even call bad. Frankly, the movie is really bad but sometimes it's funny and that's all I require sometimes.",1511481600,,1006,4.408602150537634
8200675,5,B000RGX0J0,"From the first second of the score, we know we're in for a low-rent affair w/ FIREHEAD (1991). We are whisked away to Estonia, 1988, looking more like somwhere in Pittsburgh. Soviet troops are after a ""man"" who shoots blue lasers from his eyeballs. Said ""man"", is actually a cyborg, named Ivan (Brett Porter), and he defects to the good old USA. Uh oh! Ivan's gone wild, blowing up factories! Meanwhile, Hart (Chris Lemmon- JUST BEFORE DAWN), and Meila (Gretchen Becker) are trying to track him down, in order to give him a talking to. Simultaneously, a secret organization known as THE UPPER ORDER, headed by Vaughn (Christopher Plummer- THE PYX), has been using Ivan, profiting from the destruction. Now, Vaughn wants Ivan terminated. Hart must penetrate the labyrinth of mystery, and hone in on the darkness within, or something like that. He seeks the aid of Admiral Pendleton (Martin Landau- ED WOOD) to investigate the matter. Poor Landau, he's in two scenes, w/ about six lines of dialogue. Then, he's a ghost. Luckily, Meila reappears, inexplicably dressed in a black outfit, strictly used by the French resistance during World War 2! Soon enough, the uniform comes off -relax, there's no nudity-, and we're ""treated"" to Hart roaming around in his boxers! A short time later, w/ ultra-cheeeze synth-music blaring, Hart teams up w/ Ivan. Gunfire and explosions ensue. A SIDE NOTE: You haven't lived until you've watched Chris Lemmon shooting a pistol sideways, ""gangsta"" style! Hoo yeah! Ivan prattles on in some sort of broken Russian / Transylvanian / Pig Latin, while Vaughn unleashes his operatives to stop him. ANOTHER SIDE NOTE: The meetings of THE UPPER ORDER are absolutely hilarious! Plummer has rarely overacted to this insane level! It's like watching an annual meeting of Hyperbolic Histrionics Anonymous! Hart and Ivan hit the road, camping out like hobos, while Ivan amazes Hart w/ his eye blasts! Their hobo stew looks good too! Oh gosh! Everyone's out to get them now! Thank goodness, Hart's 12 year old, egghead neighbor is available to assist! Her name is Smith and she's a smarty pants! Cuteness occurs. Action quickly returns, and no automatic weapons battle has ever been more lackadaisical! Can Hart and Ivan get to Vaughn before his henchmen annihilate them? Will Hart and Ivan be able to stop THE UPPER ORDER, before they release a biological nightmare plague? Will Hart and Ivan ever get back to their hobo stew? Did I mention Ivan's powers of telekinesis AND teleportation? Oh yes, this is pure gold, folks! Cue uber-dramatic synthesizer wonderfulness. Let the uneventful, non-finale begin!... EXTRA POINTS: For making it through the godawful, Pat Benetar impersonator's screech-warble, during the end credits!... EXTRA EXTRA MEGA POINTS: For the way the characters seem to pose like they're waiting to get their pictures taken, whenever they stop to fire their weapons during the shoot outs! Either that or they are animatronic...",1509753600,,2964,5.08829568788501
8200676,4,B000RGX0J0,"""Firehead"" is a so bad it's a true guilty pleasure for a B-movie fan. It deserves a no star review as a quality movie, but for laugh out loud cheesy badness I gave it four stars as it's utterly impossible to take seriously. The film stars Chris Lemmon as the nerdy science good guy and Brett Porter as Ivan, the Russian cyborg killing machine with laser eyes and a heart of gold, versus Christopher Plummer who plans to start a world war and kill the President among other things. I am not even willing to speculate what on earth led Plummer and Martin Landau to be in this atrocity. Produced by David ""Space Mutiny"" Winters, this film is confusing at times and unintentionally hilarious at others; none of the humor, however, is due to the witticisms that Lemmon hammily delivers to the camera with as much conviction as if he were actually made of balsa.

In short, the film starts in Estonia in 1988 at a protest when Soviet thugs are trying to quell democracy; after a courageous decision involving right and wrong that (somehow) sets the plot in motion, Firehead is there. Fast forward to 1991 and Firehead is now blowing up military factories with his brain pyrotechnics which are so cheesy they must be seen to be fully appreciated. Over the next hour and a half there are sundry subplots involving a high powered military woman (Gretchen Becker, who seems competent in nothing in particular,) bratty kids, terrible props and even worse special effects, and just unbelievably, unbelievably bad acting from everyone involved, particularly good guys Lemmon and Porter who alternate mugging for the camera and grunting in monosyllables. A word of caution: the romance subplot between Lemmon and Becker is so hackneyed, cloying, and utterly predictable that it may result in catatonia.

The crux of the film concerns a conspiracy where Plummer heads ""The Upper Order"" which echoes a would-be Trilateral Commission of evil (their symbol is even a red triangle!) This is assuming that the offices of the Trilateral Commission look like the administration wing of a middle school, of course. There are an incredible number of ponderous implausibilities that will make your brain scream for mercy and wonder what the producers actually thought they were getting for their money. Among the most egregious elements are an airplane theft that boggles the mind, a heartening discussion about ""the land of moose and squirrel"" (I swear,) hilarious dialogue like ""The time of ascension is at hand!"" and Ivan versus the ""parabolic phase shifter"" (don't ask.)

Before it's over there's a last-minute subplot about biological warfare that's wholly unnecessary but pads the running time, lots of scenery chewing from Plummer and Porter in particular, some unbelievably silly and amateurish gunplay, all of which leads to an absolutely awful conclusion that serves only to frustrate and infuriate.

As the film careens towards its annoying conclusion the President (Ed Kearney) actually utters the line ""Well, I've seen enough of this twaddle."" Me too.",1414886400,4,3039,5.035785288270378
8200677,5,B000RGX0J0,"All of Chris Lemmon's ample talent is on display in this riveting David-and-Goliath courtroom drama about a struggling attorney who takes on Big Hair Care on behalf of his client, a Russian pop singer who has been hideously disfigured when his hair mousse is ignited by stage pyrotechnics, not once but on five separate occasions. The callous money-grubbing corporate defense lawyers laugh at him and nickname him Firehead, setting the stage for a tale of righteous vengeance. Fortunately, the accidents that have ended the singer's career have also granted him the power to shoot highly destructive laser beams from his eyes. The courtroom scenes do drag on a bit despite disturbing cameos from Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond, but you know IT'S ON when the camera zooms in on Chris Lemmon as he growls, ""let's settle out of court."" The final laser rampage showdown in the shampoo factory is not to be missed. Plummer turns in an adept performance as the Radioactive Toad Boss. Firehead!",1373932800,,990,5.006060606060606
8200678,1,B000RGX0J0,"If I had to use one word to describe Firehead it would be ""incompetent"". Shot on what looks like a budget of $200, I don't know why two pretty good actors, Martin Landau and Christopher Plummer, appeared in it or how they got paid. The other ""name"" actor in it is Chris Lemmon. By the middle of the film he's wielding a gun and concocting plans to foil the bad guys. You know your movie is in trouble when Chris Lemmon is your action hero.

The plot, as if it matters, is a Russian soldier named Ivan who has developed the powers of telekinesis and pyrokinesis. He becomes disgusted with the Russian government so comes to America. He discovers that there are multiple defense contractors secretly building nuclear weapons. He starts blowing them up. Chris Lemmon plays a scientist who worked with Ivan before he went rogue. He's teamed with a woman from the military to find and stop Ivan.

No explanation is given for how Ivan knew which defense plants to blow up. The woman from the military never does anything close to being a soldier and spends most of the movie in tight skirts and high heels. None of the no-name actors can act better than your local high school drama club. Some of the scenes are staged so poorly your nephew could do better in his back yard with his dad's video camera. Firehead is a terrible movie. If you want to have your own Mystery Science Theater 3000 night, Firehead would be a good choice.",1349913600,,1424,4.494208494208494

8200680,1,B000RGX0J0,"This film had a good story idea but a horrible script, B actors and campy stunts also I think the director was on vacation while they were shooting.
The so called funny banter was so bad they should have just left it out, every word sounded as if they were just reading the script word for word.
This movie is a waste of time, money, and looks to be done all in one takes. If you like to watch bad movies just for the fun of tearing them apart and laughing at how bad they are, this one's for you, enjoy.
PS. No skin, so where did they come up with the (R) rating.",1242172800,2,564,3.956140350877193
