8357933,4,B0029LHMU4,"To be fair, I watched this on Showtime On Demand, but for those interested I can say that this documentary was sensitive, detailed, courageous, incisive, and I thought, pretty ahead of its time in those respects for ten years ago.  Everyone in it was so generous with the viewer in sharing their honest thoughts, feelings, prejudices, fears, struggles, and misgivings, especially Jamie.  It details well the incredible strength it takes to choose your best life, even if that means losing a lot and hurting a lot to live that truth.  I don't know if I'd pay 15 bucks for it, but that's just because I'm cheap.  lol  If you have Showtime and an interest in the subject at hand, it's definitely worth watching.",1434412800,,708,4.723577235772358

I had never seen the documentary and was so pleased with the entire production.
Bravo!!!!!!!",1433289600,,214,4.944444444444445
