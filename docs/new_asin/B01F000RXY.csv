7741449,1,B01F000RXY,"Soft porn for porn people, All the main cast are put bare for all to see. It is set in the early 20th century and involves the etiquette of such. Very English class divided to cut with a real sharp razor. D H Lawrence made this his bread and butter - especially upsetting the moral order/status quo.
The story is a typical drudge through the manners of such a society enlivened with some nudity to keep you - ahem - awake.",1520380800,,422,4.222222222222222

7741455,5,B01F000RXY,The film that changed my life. It started me on a journey of discovering the genius of Ken Russell. Well acted and one of the most visually stunning films ever. Glenda Jackson won her first Oscar and Ken Russell was nominated for an Oscar. Watch this film and listen carefully. You will return to it for sure. Enjoy.,1524700800,3,316,4.4655172413793105
7741456,5,B01F000RXY,"Strange, bittersweet tale of self-destructing individuals who will never find true happiness because they are much too busy having fun.  Well, sort of. Even today, Women in Love shocks with its brutal honesty; the handling of a rape, homosexuality, casual 'vagina' monologues, nude male wrestling, carefree naked dalliances in the slo-mo swaying tall grasses and suicide - brilliantly acted by Alan Bates,  Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson, in her Oscar-winning role. By far, one of the most frank and adult movies about 'love' and its detrimental fallout. Brilliantly conceived by Ken Russell in a career as varied that never ceases to amaze. Even his flops are fascinating. But Women in Love is a bona fide classic. Deservedly brought to Blu-ray from Criterion in a pristine transfer that looks spectacular. Lots of extras too. Love this disc and this movie.",1524614400,9,858,5.16546762589928
7741457,5,B01F000RXY,"DH Lawrence's  novel ""Women in Love"" has  been turned  into a movie that is  both  gripping and  profound; one  could  say unique. It  departs  from  the Hollywood  formulas to leave one  deeply  affected about  the  male/ male, male/ female relationships  depicted here. The  ego  clash  between Gerald and  Gudrun damns  their  relationship  from  the  start, whereas Rupert's desire  for a  man on man relationship in  love is overwhelmed  by the  conventional attraction between himself  and  Ursula.  Despite  his desire  for  something new in  masculine  love there is  no doubt  that  he  and  Ursula  are made  for  each other and  the  strength of  their  love will carry all before  it.  One  can sense  the  warmth of  the  femininity in Ursula being  enough  for  both of  them  So  there is  both  tragedy  and  positive  romance  here moving together in a  wave of  strength  for  this  movie. David Love, author.",1524614400,2,927,4.802721088435374
7741458,5,B01F000RXY,"It's a brilliant film and easily Ken Russell's best. In fact it's the only great film he ever made. The entire cast is wonderful and the screenplay is terrific. Great to see this classic remastered, it's been a long wait, but if ever a film deserved it this one does.",1522281600,,267,4.36
7741459,4,B01F000RXY,"Women In Love,"" an adaptation of D.H. Lawrences classic novel, is set in an English Midlands mining town. Schoolteacher Gudrun Brangwen (Glenda Jackson) strikes up a romance with aloof mine owner Gerald Crich (Oliver Reed), while her sister, Ursula (Jennie Linden), is attracted to Geralds best friend, Rupert (Alan Bates). As the two relationships develop, with director Ken Russell switching back and forth between them, each character attempts to balance his/her thoughts and feelings with their carnal urges.

The films atmosphere of romantic exploration reflects the time period in which it was made  the free-love 1960s. Director Russell incorporates sequences of elaborate lyrical reverie, abundant sex scenes, and the films most controversial scene  a naked fireside wrestling match between Bates and Reed. The dialogue features philosophical discussions about personal freedom, monogamy and marriage, with an intelligent, realistic give-and-take.

The change in the outlooks of Gudrun and Ursula toward life in general and to the status of women in particular resonates strongly today. The conversations between the sisters feel contemporary. Though the film sometimes enters the realm of melodrama, it still packs a dramatic wallop. The performances are uniformly excellent. Glenda Jackson, who had done mostly TV work prior to Women In Love, became an in-demand actress and went on to a long career in feature films.

Bonus materials on the newly-restored widescreen Blu-ray release include  two 2003 commentaries featuring director Ken Russell and screenwriter-producer Larry Kramer; segments from a 2007 interview with Russell for the BAFTA Los Angeles Heritage Archive; A British Picture: Portrait of an Enfant Terrible, Russells 1989 biopic on his own life and career; interview from 1976 with actor Glenda Jackson; interviews with Kramer and actors Alan Bates and Jennie Linden from the set; new interviews with the films cinematographer and editor; Second Best, a 1972 short film based on a D.H. Lawrence story, produced and starring Bates; and a critical essay.",1522022400,7,2079,5.584126984126984
7741460,5,B01F000RXY,"Women in Love was a ground-breaking film at it's release and it's hard to believe that it's nearly 50 years ago. Beautiful, sensual, romantic and epic. Then late Alan Bates was astonishing and Glenda Jackson, in her first film, was brilliant.  Recommended!",1521763200,5,256,5.095238095238095
