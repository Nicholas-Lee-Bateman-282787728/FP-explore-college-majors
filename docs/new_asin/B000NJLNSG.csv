2770081,5,B000NJLNSG,"I recently took a class on bookbinding and bought this video to supplement what I have learned. To my surprise, I should have bought this DVD and skipped the $360 class fee as not only does the DVD cover everything taught in class, it teaches more. I would recommend this to anyone interested in bookbinding.",1183766400,29,308,4.618181818181818
8178622,5,B000NJLNSG,I always wondered how they use to make books and this was a great way to see. I am a visual learner so watching someone do the work made the books I bought much easier to understand.,1432080000,,182,3.945945945945946
8178623,5,B000NJLNSG,"Articulate and thought out. This review says this book binding video is thoughtful and well paced. Learn vocabulary and traditional method of bookbinding. Including hand made folios, sewing, cloth board book covers, end pages, cutting of paper, and needed tools and materials and use.  Five stars for being well thought out, illustrated, narrated, and presented.  Thanks to those who made this. Thank you!",1422835200,,405,5.412698412698413
8178624,5,B000NJLNSG,"Very well done, clear, shows you everything you need to know in order to reproduce their results. Can't think of a negative.",1418688000,,124,4.681818181818182
8178625,5,B000NJLNSG,Good technique.,1411171200,,15,7.0
8178626,4,B000NJLNSG,"This was a very straightforward video that was very easy to learn from.  There are lots of videos and free resources available on the web, but I found it easier to construct my first notebook from this video before learning shortcuts and alternative techniques from other sources.  The only thing I'd say is to make sure you watch the video at least twice before shopping for your materials.  There is a shopping list provided but I don't think it lists everything, so I found myself stopping halfway through constructing my book in order to purchase something that wasn't on the shopping list.  For example, when making the backing, you need four thin sticks to lay under your cover and three wooden blocks to place on top of it ... those aren't on the list, so I had to pause for a few days until I could get them.",1375142400,4,816,4.493243243243243
8178627,2,B000NJLNSG,"Though I did get a couple of good ideas from this DVD, it is barely worth the $15 price tag. Shortcuts and glaring mistakes that can be spotted by someone as green as myself just don't belong in a so-called instructional video. These ""experts"" are a little short on expertise.",1256601600,3,276,4.54
8178628,4,B000NJLNSG,"After watching this dvd, I felt I could bind my first book.  Resources for materials would be helpful.  Also, a good deal of airtime is given to advertising other titles in the series.",1253750400,2,184,4.545454545454546
8178629,5,B000NJLNSG,This is an excellent instruction video and shows you all the ins and outs of making a book or journal for yourself or others. I will put it to good use!,1251072000,2,152,3.935483870967742
8178630,5,B000NJLNSG,"This is the first time I've ever bought or used an instructional DVD, and it was a good idea in this case. It's a lot more clear than written instructions because you can actually see the right way to do it. I recommend this for getting started in this hobby.",1237680000,7,259,4.2
8178631,5,B000NJLNSG,"I'd already made a few books when I bought this dvd.  My books were pretty good but I was having problems fitting endpapers and just felt kind of clumsy overall.  This dvd has reinforced things I thought was doing right and shown me better ways of doing things that were a problem -- his way of handling endpapers is so much easier than mine!  What a relief it is to have this to refer to.  Now, Mr. Withers, please make another dvd showing other binding methods and I'll buy that one, too.",1213401600,22,490,4.293478260869565
