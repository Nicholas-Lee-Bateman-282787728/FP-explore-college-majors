7900345,1,7885727521,"Another reviewer of this DVD complained that he or she couldn't watch it as the subtitles were in Japanese. This seemed to me an unreasonable complaint as this is precisely what the advertisement states. I speak Japanese and bought this movie BECAUSE it supposedly had Japanese subtitles (which I need for early films such as this) - It doesn't! They are Chinese, so it is useless to me as well.
If you want to sell films, get this right please.",1395964800,2,445,4.575
7900346,1,7885727521,"Let me confess that I have not seen this DVD.  If it's like all of Ozu's work I suspect I would enjoy it, but not when the subtitles are only in Japanese.  Unless you can understand spoken or written Japanese this DVD will remain a mystery.  I wonder how many people will order this ony to realize what they have purchased after it arrives.",1377993600,6,340,4.28125
