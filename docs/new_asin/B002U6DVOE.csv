8381124,5,B002U6DVOE,"What can anyone say about Pete Huttlinger's teaching and persona? He is a miracle survivor who is a great guitarist and teacher. Get any and all of Pete's DVDs. You will thank yourself. Better yet, tell someone you want the DVDs as a gift so you can thank that person.",1433894400,,268,4.38
8381125,5,B002U6DVOE,"Excellent resource for anyone wishing to learn these songs! DVD 1 has a printed tab booklet to help follow along, DVD 2 has the .pdf included on the disc that you'll need to print out yourself, but both make following along with Pete's instructions very simple and straightforward. He plays ""performance"" versions of each song at speed, but also plays them slower to assist with learning each section (verse, chorus, bridge...) This is particularly helpful when playing the lead guitar parts that are included. DVD 2 has more of Maury's leads, with great explanations as well.

I can't say enough good things about these two discs. I am methodically working my way through the first DVD, playing slowing with a metronome and it really has been a godsend for my playing. Once you get a few songs in, you'll start to see familiar picking patterns and chord progressions that make learning each song a little easier. The songs definitely build on what is learned in each previous song. You will need to be able to play barre chords comfortably for some of these songs, but Pete helps with that as well.

All in all, an excellent resource for any beginning to intermediate guitarist looking to expand their abilities and any expert wanting to add these classic songs to their repertoire. I would like to see a third disc that includes ""Tomorrow's Gonna Be a Brighter Day"" and ""Walking Back to Georgia.""

Pete Huttlinger has done the guitar world an incredible service in making these instructional DVDs available and keeping the memory and legacy of Jim and Maury alive for generations to come! If you play guitar and like Jim Croce, buy these DVDs - you won't regret it!",1405987200,,1667,4.78125

He was the reason i learned to play the guitar, I love his style.
I've muddled through his songs and knew all the words, But Pete Huttlinger
took me to the level i've always wanted to achieve.
Very clear and complete instructions and having the Tablature on
the DVD is a plus.",1395532800,2,338,4.296875

8381130,5,B002U6DVOE,"I like Jim Croce's songs and I can play it using a simple finger pattern. I was excited to have seen Pete Huttlinger playing Jim Croce's songs in Youtube and he's awesome. I'm a fan now. I'd really wanted to improve my fingersytle, that's why I've bought his DVD and found it very useful. Honestly, this is my first time to read a tablature, but with the help of Pete Huttlinger, I can play better and I'm happy playing the right finger pattern. Thanks to Pete.
  I strongly recommend this DVD to any guitar enthusiast who wants to improve their fingerpicking pattern.",1321920000,3,568,4.5588235294117645
