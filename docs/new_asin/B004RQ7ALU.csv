4461036,5,B004RQ7ALU,My 2 yr old Grandson loves it! We love Shrek. We must have watched this 10 times in 3 days!,1356134400,,91,3.6
4461037,1,B004RQ7ALU,We got this as a gift last year. What a waste of money! There is NOTHING to it. Highly disappointed. The sing along is short and the yule log is just that...a yule log for your tv. Ridiculous.,1355702400,4,192,4.078947368421052
4461038,2,B004RQ7ALU,"This is NOT a movie and I can't imagine where they get the 90+ minute run-time at the bottom of the box from! It is a 30 minute fireplace with character appearances/talking interspersed in it. It has some games and all-in-all runs like a BONUS FEATURES DISC and I kept thinking that somehow I didn't get the MOVIE. There isn't one. This is it, folks.",1355616000,12,350,4.4
4461039,1,B004RQ7ALU,"The packaging was all cut up and torn and marked all over, the actual DVD jacket was ruined. The movie itself was a joke. It's a 28 min long video of a fireplace, with the occasional character comments from the Shrek characters in the background. And the ""Singalong"" part is less than two min. long. I was so shocked when I got the package and opened it to find such a rough cover jacket and to find that shapes had been cut out of the jacket and the ISBN code had been cut out and stuff had been written on the case in permanent marker. I thought maybe it's not that bad if the video plays, which it did, but I was not expecting it to be solely a animated screen saver, because that's basically what it was.",1353456000,,708,4.13768115942029
4461040,5,B004RQ7ALU,"this was an okay special. it really was nothing special all it was is some special features that they could of put in the last shrek film.i thought that it was going to be like shrek the halls but it wasn't, but all in all it was okay. i gave it five stars because i like the characters. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.",1328227200,3,344,3.9285714285714284
4461041,1,B004RQ7ALU,"It was a rip off, there wasn't even the real movie inside the case. Inside the case there was the bonus which was just a burning fire place. Wish I would have known this when I bought it!",1404777600,,187,3.9473684210526314
4461042,5,B004RQ7ALU,It is part of Shrek so why not add it to the collection. So I got it and my grandson loves it too,1399075200,,97,3.260869565217391
4461043,1,B004RQ7ALU,"this ""DVD"" if that's what you even want to call it was not worth the postage to send it or the DVD to put it on... The DVD itself was only about 10 minutes long and had like 2 songs on it. THAT'S IT. the other option Shrek Log. is just about 15 minutes of Shreks fire place and background noise. like Shrek is having a party and you can hear the characters murmuring. will not catch any kids attention and I was very disappointed",1389571200,2,429,4.0588235294117645
4461044,5,B004RQ7ALU,my grandkids love and and laught while watching it. i will order more latter. thank you so much for it.,1386806400,,103,4.2
4461045,2,B004RQ7ALU,"SHREK THE HALLS was a decent Shrek-themed Christmas movie. Therefore, I was looking forward to seeing what DONKEYS CHRISTMAS SHREKTACULAR would be like. This special (if you can call it that-it has a running time of about 7 minutes including credits) has Donkey, Shrek, and the rest of the gang, including characters from SHREK FOREVER AFTER, gathering together to sing Christmas songs. All of the songs are shortened versions of songs; its as though the writers just threw together the first verse and part of a chorus for each piece and thats it. Theres a few funny one-liners and Gingy has a running subplot of trying to get all of the non-living gingerbread cookies out of the place before someone eats them.

The extras on the DVD include some music videos, an outtake of Who Id Be from SHREK THE MUSICAL, some silly games, music videos from other Dreamworks animated features, almost the entire story of SHREK THE HALLS told in still animation form and voice over, and the big bonus is a Shrek-themed yule log! That sucker plays longer than all of the extra features and the Donkeys Christmas Shrektacular combined. Overall, while its nice to see the Shrek characters in action again, they really aren't screen much. Theres really nothing very Shreky or spectacular about this Christmas special.",1386633600,6,1301,4.913636363636364
4461046,1,B004RQ7ALU,"This movie wasn't what we expected.  It was short and not a movie at all. We were just shocked and disappointed. I can't imagine many liking this movie, and we're pretty easy to please.",1384041600,2,185,4.4411764705882355
4461047,1,B004RQ7ALU,"This movie certainly is a DONKEY off a movie!  Who is the A$$ at DreamWorks who determined that the length of the movie is 98 minutes long.  There IS NO movie here.  This is such a bad joke.  Don't buy this movie for your children.  I bought it for my son today and he came in after being in his bedroom trying to watch it and told me there was just a fire, I thought he forgot how to use his DVD remote.  I went in his room to show him how to play the actual movie, I'm an adult, to my surprise - there is no 98 minute movie.  That is total FRAUD!  DreamWorks should pull this move off the store shelves and make the correction, the ""movie"" is only 7:25 minutes long, that's a far cry from 98 minutes!!!!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ""MOVIE"".",1379721600,15,747,3.9932432432432434
4461048,2,B004RQ7ALU,"After the delightful and in character ""Shrek the Halls"" Christmas special I had high hopes for ""Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular"" and I was sorely disappointed.  Not only does it frequently lift bits from the original (that felt like cheating me out of my moolah) but the narrative is extremely weak and serves mainly as a reason to have a variety of the Shrek cast, based out of the wonderful fourth film, to sing some lackluster reworked Christmas songs that don't come close to being ""chestnuts"".

This may be far, far more enjoyable for the young ones but part of the delight of the Shrek movies/ series is that it was written for the adult just as much if not more than for the child.  This one misses that completely.  The extras are okay and pretty par for the course and you get (wait for it...) a Shrek themed yule log!  Trust me, don't try to sit through this.  If you make use of this feature just put it on in the background and walk away.  If you think that you've missed something it won't be worth your time to go back and try to see it.

Avoid this like you would Shrek's boogers or earwax.  If you heed my advice then consider that my holiday gift to you!",1360108800,6,1171,4.359447004608295
4461049,5,B004RQ7ALU,"With Shrek & Donkey, one can hardly go wrong.  I have all the Shrek movies and enjoyed this one as well.",1358640000,,104,3.9523809523809526
4461050,1,B004RQ7ALU,"No story.  It's not worth buying. Total waste of money!!! Would not recommend this at all.
Don't understand why they made it???",1356912000,,127,4.7727272727272725

8439207,1,B004RQ7ALU,"I bought this elsewhere but I'm fuming mad .. this is not 98 min long even if you play everything on it which is a bunch of little musical skits and a Yule Log screensaver . You have to constantly pick other options as it returns to the main menu after only a few minutes . Unless your child knows how to use a DVD remote,  and has a long attention span...  this is not even worth the $4.99 I paid for it at FYI . DREAMWORKS should be ashamed of themselves for making such a stupid DVD . There is even a theatrical Shrek skit which Shrek doesn't even really look like Shrek ... I couldn't even bring myself to watch the whole thing ... Its an utter waste of money and your kids time . Everything on here should be an extra on a regular movie as it is not stand alone entertainment  .  I'm going to try to return it as we will never watch it again . ITS THAT BAD !",1450051200,,863,3.914285714285714
