8245263,3,B0012DT2TO,It was a good travel video showing lots of interesting sites along with a quick history lesson,1447891200,,94,4.588235294117647
8245264,1,B0012DT2TO,"Tedious. I've been to most of the places shown, but there is almost no info on them in the video. I'd skip it.",1405382400,,110,3.8260869565217392
8245265,4,B0012DT2TO,The author is very well documented but sounds a little too serious. However worth seeing before you plan the trip.,1397952000,,114,4.75
8245266,4,B0012DT2TO,"This  is  a  very  good  personal  video  of  travels  in  Northern Thailand .
While  I  did  kind of miss  inserts  like  maps  ( which give me a  clearer picture of  where  places  are ) ,
This  did  have  more  of  the  realistic  tone  of  what  one  experiences  on  these  trips .
Most  videos  are  the  slicker  productions  that  edit  out  all  but  the  featured  lures  of  the  trips ,
While  this  one  felt  more  like  what  one  would  encounter  on  the  whole  trip .
( I  do  suspect  tho ,  that  the  bus  rides  between  places  are  a  whole  other  experience  that
may  or  may  not  suit  others ) .
I  would  say  it  is  a  must  watch  ,  especially  if  you  are  planning  on  traveling  there .",1364256000,,727,3.90625
8245267,1,B0012DT2TO,"This is the worst quality video ...... It was like watching someones homemade video.
Don't waste your money on this video...",1301529600,,124,4.9523809523809526
8245268,3,B0012DT2TO,"I purchased this video for the scenery, because I know the area and miss it. The scenery never disappoints, narrative and comment is pedestrian.",1206662400,,144,5.041666666666667
