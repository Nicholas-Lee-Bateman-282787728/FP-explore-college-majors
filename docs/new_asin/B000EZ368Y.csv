8165402,5,B000EZ368Y,"This French film, LA COURSE DU LIEVRE A TRAVERS LES CHAMPS(Also as known as AND HOPE TO DIE) is directed by solid Rene Clement in 1972. The film is lesser known, and poorly received by many, especially in English speaking regions. However, some critics often thought this film as a minor classic of the neo-gangster genre.

In Japan, many people admire it and they would surely rank this movie as one of Rene Clement and Robert Ryan's best films. The film is somewhat surrealistic, and its abstractness failed to capture fancy of audience who would expect pure entertainment from gangster films. However, at any rate, LA COURSE DU LIEVRE A TRAVERS LES CHAMPS is a beautifully actualized film. Brutality of a criminal gang was compared with innocence of the youth, and violent scheme of the characters is explained through naive motivation such always could be found in children's game. This effort adds unique flavor to the film.

Robert Ryan plays the leader of the criminal gang which is filled with social misfits. They live on an isolated island just outside of Montreal. They have their own strange code of moral, moreover, they are like a family. Ryan's Charley is the father figure, and he enjoys total authority over planning their jobs such include kidnapping and murder. Yet, Ryan infuses quiet grace and sensitive tenderness into his character. His Charley is a life time thief and a looser, yet he is capable of treating the younger misfits with heart, just like his real children. Nevertheless, Charley is quite crafty and cunning indeed. Who else could play such a complex character but Robert Ryan?

Cool Jean-Louis Trintignant plays Tony, who accidentally mixed up himself with Charley's gang. Beautiful Lea Massari plays Charley's mistress, Suger. Craggy Aldo Ray plays ex-fighter trouble maker, Mattone. Smooth Jean Gaven plays handy artist, Rizzio. Angelic Tisa Farrow plays Pepper, a girl with confusion. They all gave quite involving performances.

Rene Clement's skillful direction is quite remarkable in LA COURSE DU LIEVRE A TRAVERS LES CHAMPS. He effectively infuses some surrealistic flavors to its visual, yet they successfully create poetic atmosphere. Editing is smooth, camera conposition is thoughtful, and music cue is quite touchy. Somewhat childlish act of Charley's gang is well compared with the mood of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Because Sbastien Japrisot, the writer, was obsessed with the world of Lewis Carroll at that time. Needless to say, the entire film is undeniably stylish.

This version is Russian import, and too bad it does not contain English subtitles.",1265932800,,2598,5.161520190023753
