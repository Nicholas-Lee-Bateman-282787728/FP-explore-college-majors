I'm hopeful that my computer drive will play it, but I just got a new computer w/o a DVD drive, and while I bought an external drive for the computer, I haven't connected it yet. It will require reconfiguring my computer desk.

I'll post later if my computer will play it. The description on your website should indicate if it is not in the standard U.S. format.",1438300800,,455,4.352941176470588

8005378,5,B00011ZC7E,"Knowing I'm a Purple/Lord fan, my wife purchased this DVD for me and got her money's worth.  This DVD has a very l o n g running time and I could not walk away from it.  Why did Lord leave Purple?  What has he been doing since?  What's the story of the Concerto Tour?  The answers are here in a very well-produced programme, rich in interviews and featuring live performances of Lord with the Hoochie Coochie men in Australia and the story behind his first piano concerto endevour *Boom of the Tingling Strings*.  THIS IS A MUST for Jon Lord fans.  It does contain some technical info, balanced with some new versions of DP songs, including ""When a Blindman Cries.""  A long interview at the end of the special features (of which there are MANY!) might be long-winded for some, but riveting to Lord fans.  After seeing this video, you will agree with the Maestro's decision to leave Purple.",1077840000,13,889,4.540880503144654
