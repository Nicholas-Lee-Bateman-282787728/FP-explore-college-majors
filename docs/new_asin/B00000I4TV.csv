I give it four stars on content alone as the quality of the tape leaves MUCH to be desired. It reminded me of the kind of tape you see during an orientation for a new job. Limited budget and time.
But don't let that dissuade you from purchasing this tape. It goes over the major arcana and the major trump cards for the lesser arcana (King - Paige) but does not go into the specific discussion over the minor arcana suits as she leaves this for the little booklet that comes with the mini deck included with the tape. She does several readings which are insightful but does not go on to elaborate how she came to such specifics when giving her readings even down to the gender and appearance of the subjects' interest.
But this is a very paced course and you will be pausing and re-winding the tape constantly if you are an avid note-taker, so fair warning to the meticulous. All in all this is a worthwhile investment for an introduction to the tarot. It is informative despite its rapid pace. Don't judge a book by its cover for even though the quality of the tape is not the best, the information contained therein is.",1079222400,2,1276,4.457264957264957
