8618588,1,B0069B0DSI,The movie wouldn't play. I ordered it twice and it wouldn't play either time. Apparently it wasn't made to play in our DVD players.,1389312000,,131,4.5
8618589,3,B0069B0DSI,"When I received this DVD I put it in my player and it said:  Disc Error  Eject Disc No playback feature, or something to that effect.  I returned it and received another which did the same thing.  After looking more closely at the info about it and researching, I found that the format is PAL which is incompatible with and won't work in US players.  I suppose I should have looked more closely, but I had no idea about this.  I feel that the description should state that it is not for use in US players.  I was quite disappointed and decided not to try to return it again.  It does play in my computer, but that is not so convenient as I bought it to play for my mother who has Alzheimers.  I will try to find out if I can buy a cable to connect my computer to my TV to see if it will play on the TV.  I like the video part, what I have watched of it, but not fond of the audio music chosen.  My mother doesn't seem drawn to the music.  If I can somehow use it with her, I will probably turn down the sound and play something else that she responds to better.  Not sure how to contact Amazon about this so they can change the description so that others in the US aren't surprised when it won't play in their players.  I will try to find out how to do this.  Guess I probably won't be too interested in buying other DVD's by this producer since I can't use them with my TV and DVD player.  Basically I think it might be enjoyable if I could play it.",1363996800,,1450,3.982638888888889
