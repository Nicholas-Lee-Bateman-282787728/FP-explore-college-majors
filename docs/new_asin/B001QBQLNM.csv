8335327,4,B001QBQLNM,"Great series, and a really good deal! Definitely one of my favorite j-drama series. :-) Only reason it's 4 stars is because the subtitles did get a little wonky at some parts... but overall great purchase!",1461801600,,205,4.722222222222222
8335328,4,B001QBQLNM,"Ryusei no Kizuna (Meteor Shower) was overall a great collection to my Ninomiya Kazunari collection (he plays the oldest brother in this show--is in the white shirt).  This on the outside, is a murder mystery, however for half of the show, you are following the antics of the misguided orphans who become scam-artists to relieve their pent-up anger and feelings of injustice.  There is certainly comedy from ""Mr. Post-It"" who becomes the main antagonist of the show.  The acting is wonderful, and there is a great twist at the end.  Nino's acting in episodes 8-10 become awesome as he goes from the nerdy awkward brother to unleashing some of his rage and controlling nature.

On the down side:  on episode 9 and 10 (the last two episodes), the English subtitles switch to Chinese names and it becomes a guessing game as to what is being said.  This is a common problem unfortunately with most Japanese tv show dvds, however it made the last episode very sketchy.  If that hadn't happened, this would have been a 5 out of 5 star review.",1296950400,4,1035,4.679558011049724
8335329,5,B001QBQLNM,"The quality is great from the DVD.
The dorama is good in my book with great acting skills by Ninomiya Kazunari, Erika Toda and Ryo Nishikido. I liked the story but not the ending somehow. Anyway, a nice one and the title song ""Beautiful days"" by Arashi is great.",1258675200,,262,4.36734693877551
