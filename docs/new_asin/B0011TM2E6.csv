8242278,2,B0011TM2E6,"Not sure why this was released as part 2 when you can buy Season I part 1 and see ALL the episodes (these five included). The budget shopper might want to save a dime or two by buying this one for $24.95...but any Bear fans will probably just fork over the 39.95 for all 10 Season I episodes. Does not even include the best episodes in my opinion which are the Everglades and African Savannah.

My advice: Just buy season I part I and don't bother with this one.",1199577600,30,462,4.191011235955056
