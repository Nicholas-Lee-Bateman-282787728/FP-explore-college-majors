Some would argue this film represents Jean Harlow at her true self.

I'm a huge Jean Harlow fan and was so excited to see a new (to me) movie of hers. I was not disappointed. While I don't think she sparkled on screen like she did in her later films, she gave a solid and completely believable performance.

The plot was predictable, but well executed. I thought the character development was a bit thin, but that's to be expected from a movie that clocks in at just over one hour. (I actually love the short running times of some classic movies: that means you can watch more of them in an evening.)

Three Wise Girls tells a story that's been told many times (small town girl moves to the city and has a rough time), but it tells the story well. And, most importantly, it tells the story with Jean Harlow.",1299888000,8,981,4.3791208791208796
8438747,2,B004R7Y4NQ,"Although it's said that ""Three Wise Girls"" (1931) was Jean Harlow's first starring film, she did share top billing with Mae Clarke and Marie Prevost, while the earlier film, ""Platinum Blonde"" (1931) she shared female lead only with Loretta Young. It's only with ""Beast of the City"" (1932) that Harlow is the lone female lead, and only with ""Red Headed Woman"" (1932) that her name appears first.

Harlow plays a young Ohio girl working as a $15 per month soda jerk and living with her mother. She's lured to New York by the tales of success of her childhood friend who is making big bucks as a model for French lingerie. She joins her and partakes of the good life, but it is not without its problems, the central one being the married men they get involved with.

20-year old Jean Harlow (1911-1937) was the biggest sex symbol of her times. Only Marilyn Monroe in the 50s ever achieved a rival position. Harlow specialized in playing the gangster's moll in such films as ""The Secret Six"" (1931) and ""Public Enemy"" (1931). When she made this film she was just starting to reach her height - the following year she made 5 films, including ""Red Headed Woman"", ""Scarface"" and ""Beast of the City,"" and she co-starred with Clark Gable in ""Red Dust"".

Mae Clarke and Marie Prevost are her friends. Walter Bryon plays a married man who gets involved with Harlow and Andy Devine plays his chauffeur.

Mae Clarke (1910-1992) will forever be known as the blond moll who got a grapefruit smashed into her face by Jimmy Cagney in ""Public Enemy"" (1931), but she made over 100 films and gave us many memorable roles, such as Dr. Frankenstein's wife in the original ""Frankenstein"" (1931) and Myra Deauville in ""Waterloo Bridge"" (1931). She does a really good job as the young girl who is tortured by her affair with a married man.

Marie Prevost (1898-1937) is little remembered today, but she had been a big star in the silent era. But due to personal and health problems her star declined just as the talkies were getting started, and she went from being a ""bathing beauty"" to being the pudgy sidekick in films like ""Cain and Mabel"" (1936). She was usually the comedian, and she plays that role in this film too.

Walter Byron (1899-1972) was a leading man in the late silent era. He does a fine job as Harlow's love interest.

This was Andy Devine's (1905-1977) first credited screen role. Devine was 27 years old when the film was made, but he looks like a teenager. He made over 400 films, include several with John Wayne (""Stagecoach"", ""Liberty Valance""), but perhaps is best remembered as Guy Madison's sidekick in TVs ""The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickock"" (1951 - 1958).

The film is directed by William ""One Shot"" Beaudine (1892-1970) who made more than 300 films and TV programs between 1915 and 1967, making him one of the longest serving film directors. Despite the prodigious output, he won no awards and spent a large part of his career at RKO's ""Poverty Row"" churning out films for less than $10,000, although in the silent era he worked on films like ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915), ""Intolerance"" (1916), and ""Sparrows"" (1926). He's most famous for his work on The Bowery Boys films and for such classics as ""Billy the Kid vs. Dracula"" (1966).

Beaudine's direction is relatively flat and unimaginative. The story itself is also reasonably dull and takes a long time to warm up to the central points. Harlow is her usual wise cracking self, but in this film she is a ""good girl"".

1931 was a great year for film - ""Frankenstein"", ""Dracula"", ""M"", ""City Lights"", ""Public Enemy"", ""Cimarron"" (Best Picture), ""Min and Bill"", and ""The Champ"" . Compared to these, ""Three Wise Girls"" leaves a lot to be desired. If you're interested in Harlow and these type of ""morality plays"" that were common in the early 30s, this film will have some appeal. But otherwise it has doesn't have that much to recommend it.",1299715200,10,3894,4.6798245614035086
