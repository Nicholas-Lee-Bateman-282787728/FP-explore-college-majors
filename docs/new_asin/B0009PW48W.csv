8065179,5,B0009PW48W,"Very good live concert. I'm glad I snatched it before it disappeared.
Glenn Hughes is only doing a few numbers, but the whole concert is very energetic.
The center figure is, of course, the guitar player,  Walter Giardino, who is an absolute copy of Ritchie Blackmore.
Everything about his manners and playing screams Ritchie Blackmore!
What an amazing musician!!! I enjoyed the concert thoroughly.
Video is a little choppy, sound is floating up and down, but the energy of the musicians well makes up for any technical abnormalities...
Again, I'm happy I got it!",1486166400,,563,4.98936170212766
