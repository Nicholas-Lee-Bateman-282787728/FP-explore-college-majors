4255479,5,B0043DMJL8,"Great work out. My whole body feels it when I'm done. I like how the back and arm muscles are incorporated too. And did I mention timely. 5 min warm up, two 20 min work out options and a 5 min cool down/stretch.
Bought for my mom who has knee and foot pains because I read a review that it wasn't too ""heavy impact"". I exercised to the dvd with her a few times. Just ordered one for myself!",1390780800,3,390,3.949367088607595
4255480,5,B0043DMJL8,"I really enjoy Joy's workout video.  While it isn't as difficult as some, she and Lisa make sure your entire body benefits with a warm-up, cardio, strength training, ab conditioning and stretching.  I am very pleased to make her CD part of my workout collection.",1362009600,,262,4.8
4255481,5,B0043DMJL8,"I love this workout. It's us broken up into two 20 minute segments. If you are short on time , just do one, I usually do both for a heat workout.  There is cardio aswellcas muscle toning. It us easy to hollow and go , a greet addition to your workout library.",1358553600,,259,3.980769230769231
4255482,5,B0043DMJL8,This workout is great for someone who exercises but really doesn't push themselves.  I walk daily but never really do anything more.  This is perfect!!,1356825600,,151,5.0
4255483,5,B0043DMJL8,"I am not sure, but I think I lost about 30 lbs. or more just by following this video by Joy Bauer for a few months. I wish I had purchased this video first. I was not quite ready for the first video's I purchased. Both Joy Bauer's Slimdown Workout and The 10-minute Solution Hot Body Boot Camp by Amy Bento were very professional but the strength needed for The 10-minute Solution exercises was tremendous, and it was months' before I was even ready to attempt several moves. I did lose 20 lbs. or more after doing my best at using this video for about a year. Joy Bauer is more gentle and concerned about getting you started, regardless of whether you are just beginning or are already an athlete. I highly recommend her video to anyone for fitness. I can't remember ever being sore. She knows how to protect and encourage gently, without pushing too hard.",1328140800,13,857,4.464968152866242
4255484,4,B0043DMJL8,"This was a great video to work out to, the people are not annoying as they go thru the routine and add a few moves to make it more fun.  While you are doing it you are thinking this can't be doing anythng it doesn't seem difficult enough, but the next day you can feel it all over.  Good variety of moves.",1301356800,9,305,3.903225806451613
4255485,4,B0043DMJL8,I am a beginner when it comes to working out.  Joy's workout is easy to follow and fun.  She gives tips to make it easier or harder.  It is divided into two segments so you can do both or just one.,1298937600,6,197,3.7560975609756095
4255486,4,B0043DMJL8,"This is one of the best workout DVDs I've ever used. My husband and I are over 65 and it's difficult to find a workout that isn't either too easy or too strenuous.  Both the cardio and weight portions of this workout are great and the stretches at the end of the session are wonderful.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joy-Bauer-s-Slimdown-Workout/dp/B0043DMJL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joy Bauer's Slimdown Workout</a>",1297728000,11,457,6.491803278688525
4255487,5,B0043DMJL8,"I know I have been very lucky. My first weight gain began 2 yrs ago when I was 46 yrs old. 16 pounds later, my back hurt and I did not fit comfortably (or at all in some cases) into my jeans and work skirts- and my once cute tops now hugged a little belly and small ""love handles"". A combination of things caused this- new job which equaled less exercise,  an anti anxiety pill and nutella seem to be the main culprits. I had excuses for not joining the gym (no time, too expensive, full time job, 12 year old kid, etc) and not giving up nutella and other sweets that I ""just"" nibbled at each night (too delicious).  During New Years, we stayed with a bunch of friends, one of whom had Joy's dvd. I decided to join the group, more as a social thing rather then an exercise workout . Afterwards, to my amazement, a bell went off in my head. A half hour commitment. 30 minutes- that's all. Even I couldn't find an excuse not to carve out 30 minutes for my body and health. I got my own tape, and made a 3x per week minimum committment to myself. To my utter surprise (and delight), 6 wks later, I have completed one of Joy's 2 do-able 20 minute workouts (plus 5 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down) at least 3x per week. And I've only had nutella 1x- and have drastically reduced  my junk food nibbling-- mostly because I feel that if I'm working out, I don't want to ""ruin"" it with too much junk (so I have MUCH less!) And I have lost 8 of the extra pounds I had put on. Thank you Joy for creating an at home program that I can easily follow and enjoy sucess!",1297382400,9,1560,4.074918566775244
