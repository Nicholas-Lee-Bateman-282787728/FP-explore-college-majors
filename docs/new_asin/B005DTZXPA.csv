4662099,5,B005DTZXPA,Three movies for less than $10 is not only great but the three movies selection are very good action packed classics. If you like war movies or are a world war 2 buff these 3movies will be a great addition to your collection. The picture quality is excellent.,1371427200,17,259,4.416666666666667
4662100,4,B005DTZXPA,"I first saw Bridge at Remagen in 1969 while still on active duty in Viet Nam, I was down in Saigon waiting to go on leave to Hong Kong and I went to see this movie with a buddy then, I always liked it, so I finally bought it, I was surprised I could still get a copythese days. It is a good action type movie and I highly recommend it if you like that war/combat genre.  It has a good cast too.",1369958400,12,394,3.746987951807229
4662101,5,B005DTZXPA,"633 SQUADRON is quite British and a very entertaining World War II action adventure film that focuses both on the RAF pilots and their primary mission to obliterate a German rocket fuel plant located in occupied Norway.  Starring Cliff Robertson as Wing Commander Roy Grant he leads an excellent cast that includes Harry Andrews as Air Vice Marshal Davis, Michael Goodliffe as Squadron Leader Frank Adams and George Chakiris as Lt. Erik Bergman. Directed by Walter Grauman, this film features brilliant color cinematography by veteran Edward Scaife (KHARTOUM, THE DIRTY DOZEN, DARK OF THE SUN), another outstanding WWII score composed by Ron Goodwin (WHERE EAGLES DARE) and impressive special effects Tom Howard (WHERE EAGLES DARE). Cliff Robertson is a skillful, steadfast and always interesting actor who once again turns in an introspective performance underplaying a role that still commands the focal point of the viewer. It was good to see George Chakiris in another role aside from WESTSIDE STORY but his screen time and overall part seem a bit lacking in 633 SQUADRON. There is a lot of daring do and typical heroics in this film, but the integration of actual air footage by editor Bert Bates really make this film noteworthy. The air scenes in the narrow Norwegian fjord of the squadron under incredible anti-aircraft fire from the Nazi guns is truly exciting. Most effective for me was Ron Goodwin's uplifting and energetic score and main title he composed used throughout. This little gem of a film has been around for some time and it remains endearing to those of us who grew up with it. I highly recommend it.

THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE has been around for some time now and I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre on its initial release. Through the years I came to love this film and realized it is truly one of the best war films ever made. Yet, more importantly it is just a great film given any genre. As the film unfolded I thought it was going to be another rehashing of the DIRTY DOZEN formula, but of that I was wrong. The DIRTY DOZEN is one of the all-time classic and innovative war films ever made where a band of misfits is tossed together and honed into a crack fighting unit during WWII. THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE based on some factual events, similarly takes American misfits and brings in a crack battle hardened unit of Canadian infantry and ultimately forms a ""special forces"" brigade. At the heart of both films is the training and the camaraderie that builds between these men tossed together in the extraordinary circumstances of war. Director Robert Aldrich's handling of the DIRTY DOZEN is very successful and his style of camaraderie seems rather blunt and brutal at times, but yet he built a cohesive unit to accomplish the mission. In THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE director Andrew V. McLaglen takes the John Ford approach. His scenes and direction of building and honing a cohesive and effective unit of fighting men, building that important element of camaraderie, are both bawdy and sentimental. Andrew V. McLaglen and his father had a long working association with John Ford and you see that visually on the screen in THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE. For me, this a more endearing approach. During times of war men are tossed together from many backgrounds and are called upon to serve their country and those of their allies under such uncommon circumstances from ordinary daily life testing their will and fortitude to get the job done. Andrew V. McLaglen captures that spirit in THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE.

In the film the American contingent are initially seen at odds with their Canadian counterpart. William Holden seems somewhat cold and distant as he takes up the task to mold this diverse group of men into a singular brigade that will perform with courage and valor in the field. He plays the well-disciplined Canadian unit up against the motley undisciplined ragtag group of American misfits and loners for the sole purpose of congealing and forming a cohesive spirit among the American contingent so they ultimately think as one and become one and have a common purpose to outshine the Canadians. When Holden finally lets both contingents go into town, it is there that both the Americans and Canadians finally meld into what will ultimately be the brigade as they unwittingly join forces in a brawl to end all brawls against a gang of lumberjacks at the local saloon. You know what? They just don't write scripts like this anymore. There is no cynicism here, no cinematic nonsense acknowledging the presence of some higher ideological military code of honor. These are just ordinary guys who will party hard, fight to the death and get the job done. The way they talk, walk, move and act tells us all we need to know about them.

When they finally put those red berets on and finally assemble on the parade ground as one unit, one brigade, you can't help but get a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye. There is so much more I can say about this film. Just see it for yourself. My dad served in WWII and The Korean War. We both loved this movie and watched it together so many times. I still think of images of Claude Akins and Jack Watson at odds and then the friendship they developed, Richard Jaeckel and his acrobatic feats, Andrew Prine earning his way through blood and guts and many other images too numerous to mention. I have lost focus of what I wanted to say, but I am thankful for this film in more ways than one.

THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN is a fairly good World War II adventure film full of action and suspense and an interesting script. George Segal and Ben Gazzara give standout performances and share a unique camaraderie on screen that enhances the overall effectiveness of the drama. Robert Vaughn's character is tragic in nature as he is simply a German officer trying to get his job done. It also features Bradford Dillman, E.G. Marshall and Bo Hopkins. There are some truly good combat sequences and a plot, which is quite captivating. It contains a good score composed by Elmer Bernstein with a little more drive and more modernistic, which is less intellectual than his GREAT ESCAPE score. Yet, it is very effective in this film. John Guillermin neatly directed it for maximum entertainment value. I am not sure how historically accurate this film is, but it will keep you glued to your seat for shear excitement.",1337040000,34,6362,4.759057971014493

4662110,4,B005DTZXPA,"I've been a fan of WWII films and 'The Bridge at Remagen' has always been a favorite of mine. George Segal is superb as the efficient, war weary lieutenant. Bradford Dillman is also good as the suck-up major who always volunteers his men just to make himself look good in the eyes of his superiors.

The bridge itself proved vital for our military advance during the war, and it's described here in good detail. Also shows how many Germans suffered under the brutal rule of Nazism.

633 Squadron is still one I haven't yet seen.

I'm a fan of William Holden, but 'The Devil's Brigade' isn't one of his best. It's still worth seeing from time to time and the action sequences in Italy are very good. The best scenes are during the training the Americans and Canadians go through before being shipped to Europe.",1489104000,,809,4.56551724137931

4662146,3,B005DTZXPA,"When 633 Squadron was first released, it was a popular war movie.  It is now dated with a weak storyline and special effects no longer impressive.
The Devil Brigade fares even worse.  A rehash of Dirty Dozen with boring and overlong fight sequences.
Only Bridge at Remagen remains a good B-war film for that era with crisp actions and direction greatly helped by its stars George Segal, Robert Vaughn, Ben Gazzara and other supporting cast.

The Devils Brigade, seems to be almost a ""dirty Dozen"" times very many, pitting a crack Canadian Squad against an American Squad made up of criminals, cutthroats and thieves. All for the sake of getting the very best for a special mission. The Bridge at Remagen is the story of the American's needing to capture the lst bridge crossing the Rhine River into Germany since the German's have destroyed all the rest and they want to trap 75,000 German troops on the wrong side. My Favorite was 633 Squadron. the story of the unified attack by American's and Norwegian freedom fighters in trying to shut down a fuel factory in a Norwegian fjord.

One star for Devil's Brigade (lots of cliches, here, guys and gals); three stars for Bridge at Remagen.
Agree with one other reviewer: aside from the sheer scale of the Richard Attenborough epic, Remagen is far better than a Bridge Too Far
Agree with another reviewer: 633 Squadron suffers--as many films produced before the 1970s do--from substandard effects. Doncha hate bad model work, whether it's on sea (In Harms Way) or in the air (this one, and countless others?)

633 Squadron
A bomber squadron practices for the big mission scheduled to take place in a Norwegian fjord. This film is a standard war drama with good aerial scenes and quite a bit of action. There are several subplotscaptured airman, love interests, bar scenes. Nothing spectacular, but interesting enough to watch.

The Bridge at Remagen
The last, remaining bridge over the Rhinethe Germans want to blow it up to prevent the Allies from using it to easily cross into Germany, even though they will strand many German soldiers on the wrong side of the bridge. The Allies want to save the bridge for easy crossing into Germany. Most war movies include scenes that do not advance the plot, and even though this includes such scenes (the captured French girl in the farm house with gratuitous semi-nudity, idle soldier chatter, etc.), there are a minimum os such scenes in this film. Theres a lot of action, and a lot of five-star explosions. This is a well-done war film and well worth watching.

The Devils Brigade
A polished, professional squad of Canadians report to camp in perfect formation with bagpipes playing. An American squad reports to camp roughhousing, slovenly and undisciplined. They train together for an important mission. Most of the film takes place in camp with the factions training for their missioncompetitions, hijinks, silliness. A lot of humor through the first 3/4 of the film with the hard-core action coming during the mission in the last 1/4. An interesting viewing experience.",1505001600,,1592,5.0227272727272725

8467586,4,B005DTZXPA,All 3 movies are very good especially the Devils Brigade and the Bridge at Remagen which is very close to a tie as being the best. The 663 Squadron had a good plot and was action packed. The thing I didn't like was that there were too many movie props used. A lot of the air planes appeared to be made out of balsa wood or they were plastic models.. The ending was also unusual because only (1) airman made it out alive. It would have been nice to know if he was able to make it back to his base or if he was captured by the Germans. Other then that the trio is a good purchase and worth while..,1503100800,,595,3.925619834710744
