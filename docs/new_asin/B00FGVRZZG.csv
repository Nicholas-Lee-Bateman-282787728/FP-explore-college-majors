8615683,5,B00FGVRZZG,"This is another rare dvd set of anime here. They only released the other half of season 3 but skipped the virtual world. The virtual world ARC is great ,plenty of duels,plenty of humor & plenty of drama also. It was well done with a nice storyline. I do not understand why they release it so late.",1395360000,,297,4.228070175438597
