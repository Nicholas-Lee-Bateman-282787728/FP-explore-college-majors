8347608,1,B001X7W4X0,"Do not by this DVD if you wish to learn real training techniques.  This guy is a Jane Goodall-esque crackpot.  If your looking for practical instruction on understanding your horse/es and desire to develop better training techniques I highly recommend Clinton Anderson from Australia.  Much more grounded and practical.
This DVD is done in a highly artistic matter with lots of puff and fluff.  If you ask me this author does not live in the real world.",1336521600,,453,4.8441558441558445
