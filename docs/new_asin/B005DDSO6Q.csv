Fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killing-Complete-Season-1-5-DVD-Box-Set-Forbrydelsen-Forbrytelsen-The-Killing-Complete-Season-One-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-United-Kingdom/dp/B004KKPQMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killing - Complete Season 1 - 5-DVD Box Set ( Forbrydelsen (Forbrytelsen) ) ( The Killing - Complete Season One ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - United Kingdom </a>] were given 20 hours with the Birk Larsen family, the charismatic Troels Hartmann and the one and only Sarah Lund. Back then we were to explore a host of characters and for the first time in a drama series we were given the opportunity to explore the grief of a family who had just lost a daughter. How could a second series improve on perfection?

Well in just a 10 hour series, DR (Danish Broadcasting Corporation) manages to equal if not surpass their strengths of series 1. Again we meet Sarah Lund played to absolute perfection by Sofie Grbl. This time Sarah is stationed at Gedser, southern Denmark checking passports. Lennart Brix (Morten Suurballe), Vibeke (Anne Marie Helger) and Mark Lund (Eske Forsting Hansen) are the only other three returning characters from series 1. Troels Hartmann and co are swapped for Thomas Buch and co. Copenhagen municipal politics has now become Danish politics on a national level involving the Prime Minister, Justice and Defence Ministries, alongside the Ministry of Integration, briefly. The Birk Larsens are replaced by the Rabens.

The second series has a much faster pace to it than the first and although there is less exploration of the characters as there was in series 1, this series is no worse for it. Sofie Grbl is once again supported by some of Denmark's finest acting talent. Nicolas Bro is outstanding as new Justice Minister Thomas Buch. Ken Vedsegaard is utterly convincing as Jens Peter Raben held in Herstedvester Prison. And as a new sidekick for Lund we have Ulrik Strange played by Mikael Birkkjr. Birkkjr also stars in DR's 2010 offering&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Government-Season-1-Ep-1-10/dp/B004Z32E0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Government: Season 1 (Ep. 1-10)</a>&nbsp;along with a couple of other performers from the earlier series.

Watching a series with subtitles in a minor Scandinavian language does require concentration. Aided by excellent subtitling to help steer you around the twists and turns throughout the 10 episodes, this programme really is a joy to watch.

Why is it that a country of less than six million people can produce such fine quality TV whereas the UK comes up with nothing anywhere near this calibre? If Saturdays at 9pm in the fall on UK TV mean I'm a Celebrity, The X Factor or Casualty for you, then The Killing is probably not going to be your cup of tea. With episodes reaching over a million viewers, more than double that of the first series and beating any other foreign language programme by a long way, The Killing proves that decent quality compelling TV does not always originate from the USA or the UK. Episodes aren't 42 minutes long to enable countless ads to be squeezed in. Most episodes are just short of an hour. Each hour spent watching this set will fly by.

You may want to familiarise yourself with a couple of bridges whilst watching the series. The Great Belt Bridge connects two Danish islands Funen and Zealand. The Oresund Bridge connects Danish Zealand with Swedish Skane. Copenhagen, where the main drama unfolds is located on Zealand just over the water from Swedish Malmo on the other side of the Oresund Bridge.

Ever been questioned by the police while in the shower? Well one of the characters in The Killing 2 has Sarah Lund at her best while in the shower. What's a Danish wedding like and will all family members attend? Will Sarah open up to anybody? Find out in this fantastic boxset.

Also included in this boxset is a 19 minute bonus feature on the making of The Killing which has an interview with Sofie and producer Piv Bernth.

Thank you BBC4 for striking gold, Arrow Films for providing the DVD release, DR for making gold, and The Guardian for providing such a worthy accompanying blog to the series.

Enjoy!

Hope that BBC4 screens series 3 as soon as Denmark screen it in late 2012!

And if you need another fix of Sofie and Mikael, have a look at this December 2011 re-release of Aftermath in which they star as a married couple. Two other films I recommend for fans of Sofie and Mikael are Sofie's first ever film from 1986<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-at-the-Door-VHS/dp/6301802578/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolf at the Door [VHS</a>] and a 2005 film with Mikael in the lead role Springet, along with Vrelse 304 from 2011.

4657891,5,B005DDSO6Q,"This series is just about perfect. Don't waste your time on the English version - get used to the subtitles. It's worth it. Brilliant acting, fabulous photography, great writing. The best crime/political thriller I've ever seen. I was held in suspense until the very last episode. Can't wait for the next season.",1332547200,15,312,5.019230769230769
4657892,5,B005DDSO6Q,"This is a MUST see for folks who like intense noir police shows with great acting & writing, a show made for an older or more book read crowd, no big shoot-outs, car chases, implanted bimbos or Ken Doll FBI Agents, this is a drama for the thinking viewer.

The case lasts for 20 days and each show represents a single day, this gives the show time to develop the story, characters, the plot & allows us to really get to know each character in minute detail, the impact of the crime on the family is heart wrenching stuff & so rarely shown on US TV where people get blown away & 5 minutes later it's like nothing important happened.

I hate to compare this show to any others as it's a true original but if you liked The Millennium Trilogy (The Girl With etc.....), Wallander, Harry Hole', early Prime Suspect, Homicide, Life on The Streets, ""Spiral"" (""Engrenages"" a great little French sleeper too) you MUST see this show.

This Danish masterpiece was even a big hit on BBC TV with (English subs), & believe me that is tough crowd :)

BTW:
I must give credit to the English version shown on the AMC channel, it's still pretty good & for those who just can't watch anything with sub-titles, this may be the version for you, still a great story but watered down, incomplete, & over simplified from the Danish original but still light years ahead of what passes for Network crime drama nowadays.",1329177600,30,1392,4.468503937007874

4657895,5,B005DDSO6Q,"I have not seen the first set of this Danish series (with English subtitles). To  the best of my memory, I have never seen any Danish film or television program. If this is a sample of what they are putting out, their standards are quite high. Since I use the subtitles, even in English language films and television, I was quite at ease with these ten, roughly 55 minute broadcasts, which I saw over three days. The story, recounting the political and law enforcement dilemmas posed by the possibility that the killing of innocents by Danish forces in Afghanistan was suppressed by the Government or some part of it, is a good one, well told. The acting is superior, as is the filming. In true soap opera fashion, there are numerous complexities, red herrings, betrayals and romance as well. A second viewing would no doubt reveal the fairly numerous weak and, particularly, artificial appearing segments; however,  I should think most people would not find these bothersome in the face of constant drama, confrontation, resolution and dissolution of ""solutions"" that mark the screenplay.
Most devotees of either sub-genre, mystery or  politics, should find this one quite satisfying.",1406160000,,1185,5.035714285714286

4657899,5,B005DDSO6Q,"What a terrific series  this is.  I was hooked from the very start and couldn`t wait to get to he final episodes to find out who the baddie was.  In turn, I suspected just about everybody in the cast. so once or twice I was right but most of the time, completely wrong!

This time Sara Lund and her partner are investigating the killing of four innocent people by Danish troops in Afghanistan. Troops who were part of the group involved, are being killed.  There is also a political component as it becomes clear that certain ministers knew, but no one did anything about an investigation. Everything was kept quiet.

The whole plot kept me on tenterhooks.

There is also an interesting documentary where the producer says that no-one except she,the director, and the writers, knew whodunnit, so it lead to lots of conversations between everyone involved from the stars onwards..

I really can`t praise this film enough.  The standard is enormously high and the actors do a wonderful job breathing life into the complex characters they play.  Wonderful.",1373846400,3,1053,4.832402234636872

It is so engrossing I almost think I can speak Danish and actually know the place and the people in the film.

4657908,5,B005DDSO6Q,"One of the really great detective murder mystery shows. Extremely well-written but it's the casting that makes it really extraordinary, starting with the wonderful Sofie Grobol as Det. Sarah Lund. A unique and intriquing performance.",1360454400,3,233,5.685714285714286
4657909,5,B005DDSO6Q,A most enjoyable series to watch with so many twists and turns I highly recommend watching this riveting mystery/thriller. The subtitles are great but you cannot take your eyes away from the TV!,1356825600,3,194,4.909090909090909
4657910,5,B005DDSO6Q,"Just when you thought you've seen it all for crime thrillers, along comes Detective Sarah Lund a la Danish (she has started a ""jumper"" aka Faroe Isle sweater craze) surprisingly riveting take, especially since we Americans only associate Victor Borge-ish humor with the Danes.  Deeper waters run through this Danish TV series which hooked me into figuring out the clues with Lund for all 40 episodes of Seasons One&Two. For Season One, I'm proud to say I fingered the murderer correctly by the second episode but wasn't ever certain until the end because the screenplay keeps you uncertain as does real-life investigating.  . .as the series subtitle says,  be careful who you trust.  Season Two was harder to determine; however, for both, what amazed me was my constantly shifting judgments of who to trust or not trust.  So be warned about mental gymnastics  and compulsion to see the entire 2 seasons within a few days.  I'm now awaiting the final Season Three to sell next year.  BTW don't bother with the American lesser knock-off of this original Danish TV series also sold under Danish title ""Forbrydelsen"" (The Crime). I say always go for the original over imitation.",1355097600,7,1174,4.9238578680203045
4657911,5,B005DDSO6Q,"Series 2's English subtitles are poorly written compared with Series 1's. The English grammar is a bit scruffy and the choce of words leans toward an archaic, slangish Britishness. An example is when a Danish character (they are all Danish) tries to hurry people out of his office and finishes by saying 'kom kom'. This is translated as 'chop chop!' I fear, all in all, and noticing misteps like that and others, that we are not only getting a weird wash of 'Britishisms', which is distracting, but that some of the correct meaning of the Danish is also being lost.

The first season has 20 episodes and the second season about 12-14. (And the 2nd is Much more expensive.)

There are a couple of leaps of story which made me wonder if there was a novel being hurriedly condensed. (One character suddenly decides to cut herself off from another character, for instance, but we don't see her thinking in getting her there. Is there more that was shown on Danish TV that we didn't get to see? -- Like with the version of TGWTDT, which turned out to be about five episodes long instead of the original three, and the five were much better.) Turns out these are original scripts.

In the 'Making of...' It turns out there is a Season 3. AMAZON, please make it available.",1352073600,2,1265,4.563876651982379
4657912,4,B005DDSO6Q,"Another well written, acted piece of entertainment. It was tightly sewn together and very suspenseful. The second series had a lot of nudity and graphic violence in it . . . more so than the first. The first just made you think you saw violence with angle shots etc. This season showed it all . . . no pun intended.

The only issue I have with the first and second season is the ideas that our enemy is not Islam or Muslims. Yes the shows acknowledge it but it seems that there is a subtle theme in these two series that in these cases they are not the enemy . . . we are. I of course 100% reject that. I think that is liberal multiculturalism run amuck . . . denial. But it is done so subtely that I cannot tell if that is really what is intended or . . . it is subtle affirmation of what you see in happening in these two series, esp this one--season 2.

Anyway, this series shows the naive eager beaver politician who runs around moralizing but is just as corrupt as the rest. It shows modern Western culture grappling with the conflict of a war on terror and how it has affected us more than we even realize. It shows the dynamics of human relationships and how life's events test them. And it shows fierce Sarah Lund who is surrounded by doubters and people who interfere with her but never lets anyone make her doubt herself. We see in this season a lesser focus on her for most of the series than we did, I feel, in the first. But that is intentional I guess given the storyline--how the first season left off. But she finishes this season up as she did the first time around. We see her personal relationships still strained but we see her mother being more supportive of her strange-to-the-outsider behavior.

I hope people can even appreciate the poetic symbolism in some of the scenes in both series that makes this a higher caliber of TV show than the rest . . . but not cheesy art-trying-to-be-art. The distorted reflections of the Minister of Finance in the water pitcher. The always starved politician in the first series--hungry for more.

Anyway, if this is what Danish society is like count me out. But it is a good season two. I'm not bored yet.",1334966400,2,2164,4.335802469135802
8466584,5,B005DDSO6Q,"""Like the most"" is putting it too mildly,  Mikael Birkkjr, the Danish actor playing opposite Sofie Gabol in Season 2, is devastatingly attractive, completely magnetic, and their relationship, professional and otherwise, is riveting.  Too bad nothing as adult or interesting ever comes out of Hollywood.

8466585,5,B005DDSO6Q,"Forbrydelsen - Season 2 or The Killing is a 2009 ten-episode Danish murder mystery and thriller, created and written by Soren Sveistrup, and produced by Danish DR Television. In this second season, the story line begins with the investigation of the gruesome and mysterious murder of a female Danish attorney, who has been representing several members of a squad of Danish Army soldiers, who had served in the war in Afghanistan. The lead detective is an introverted and conflicted female police officer, who is a brilliant and relentless investigator, but who is unable to communicate effectively, and to separate her chaotic work life from her dysfunctional personal life. There are many clever plot twists, which serve to challenge the viewer throughout the course of the series. Forbrydelsen is an exceptionally intelligent and intriguing detective procedural series, because it provides numerous credible murder suspects, each of whom is highly suspicious, and could easily be the killer. In addition, the atmosphere of Forbrydelsen is exceedingly dark and foreboding, in the classic Nordic Noir cinematic style. The performance of the lead actor, Sofie Grabol, is absolutely outstanding, as are the performances of the members of the talented supporting cast. Forbrydelsen - Season 2 is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. Forbrydelsen - Season 2 features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1505779200,,1628,5.542168674698795

Well, except one, and that are two little flaws that made the ending less than satisfactory.  The first involves the photography, which is unique but carried out in almost dark situations repeatedly.  It seems to be always raining, and always dark in Denmark.  The second is the ending.  It could be just a little bit clearer.  A sentence or two, perhaps.

8466593,5,B005DDSO6Q,"The only bad thing about ""The Killing"" is that it's impossible to stop watching it until it's over. Sofie Grabol is excellent, and the entire cast is just great. As in the first season, there are so many twists and turns that it's difficult to figure out what's really going on as the bodies pile up. When you think you know who the bad guy is, well, guess again. I was almost relieved that Season 2 is only 10 episodes vs the 20 of Season 1 - not sure I was up for another 20 hours of non-stop watching! While the American version of ""The Killing"" failed to keep my attention (and I did try to watch it), the Danish original just grabs hold and doesn't let go. I credit most of that to Grabol's amazing performance as Sarah Lund. I'm just glad I have an all region DVD player so that I can watch all of the great TV series and movies coming out of Scandinavia, the UK, Australia, and so many other countries. It's a shame there is such a thing as region restrictions. If you have access to a region free DVD player, don't hesitate to add this season of The Killing to your collection.
