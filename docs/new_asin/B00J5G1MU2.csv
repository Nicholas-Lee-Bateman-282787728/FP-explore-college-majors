6333635,4,B00J5G1MU2,"Lucy (Cristin Milioti) has a wonderful life with Wade (Michael Rady) an idea husband and they also have a child. Lucy works for Glen (James Urbaniak) counseling abused women. She was once a patient of Glen's and their doctor/patient relationship got too personal.

Lucy and Wade both see ghosts in their house. It is an abused family and Lucy believes she can fix it. Lucy employs a ""Jesus Freak"" babysitter who talks about demonic possession. Meanwhile there is a man, who is not a ghost sneaking around outside the house taking photos. Lucy also has a sister who stays distant from her.

The ghosts become more formidable as things go on. If you haven't figure things out in the first hour with the over abundance of clues, they will tell you most of it at that point.

The twist was not unexpected and has been used in a number of films which I won't name. Things come together rather neatly at the end. A well done thriller, perhaps done too often.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, brief sex, no nudity.",1395619200,8,1003,4.58659217877095

8648332,4,B00J5G1MU2,"A good tension builder, although, not as believable as some movies go. The movie portends that this house is haunted, but, it's the woman that has issues...but doesn't want to move or get real help...sloppy, in the filming, blood or bruises on people, yet are gone in the next scene...Okay for a Saturday popcorn flick.",1412121600,2,319,4.818181818181818
