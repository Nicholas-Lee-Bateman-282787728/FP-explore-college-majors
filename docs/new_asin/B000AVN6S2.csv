8324970,5,B000AVN6S2,"If you consider yourself a horror fan, It's your duty to watch ""Una de Zombis"". This spanish take on the Zombie genre is a gem, the movie's got it all: gore, action, great performings, a Tarantinesque zig-zag plot, unexpected twists, parody, rude / in your face and most of the time over the top kind of humor and the genious of Santiago Segura behind it. Forget about what you've seen before: italian and asian Zombies or previous spanish film incursions in this side of the fright film spectrum; if you want your classic ghoul chasing humans in search of flesh and (sometimes) brains with a social message included kind of flick look somewhere else, this is anarchic cinema at it's best, the kind of movie that'll make you rethink about the possibilities that the living dead subgenre still has to offer.",1152144000,2,806,4.723404255319149
