8348247,4,B001YZK15O,"My wife loves Jack Dee's Rick Spleen character, and that's good enough for me. Spleen is at once entirely egregious and curiously sympathetic - maybe a bit like Mr Bean, but easier to recognise oneself in. He is petty, vain, dishonest, pusillanimous, untalented, envious, clumsy, thoughtless, supercilious and whatever else you can think of, and in each episode the character's rich combination of personality quirks gets him into impossible situations, from which he ineptly labours to extricate himself. For this series, Dee has surrounded himself with a brilliant comic cast to pull off the characters which serve as foils for Spleen's antics. In particular, his awfulness is counterpointed by a wife and a scriptwriter (Spleen is a comedian of modest prospects) who combine all the virtues which he lacks (pretty much the lot, then) and an au pair who is as intractably miserable as he is. My favourite is the twinset: his spineless and entirely parasitic daughter and her spineless and entirely parasitic boyfriend. Others like the health food caf owner, whose everyday exterior belies a bizarre personality at once like and unlike Spleen's.",1398556800,,1146,5.233695652173913
