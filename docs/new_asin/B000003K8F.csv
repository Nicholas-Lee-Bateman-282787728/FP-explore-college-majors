The story centres around  Sisko and his realisation of how much he loves his emissary status and that  he muct compete with Akorem and reclaim his right as the representative of  the Prophets. When Akorem returns to Bajor he revives some 300 year old  traditions that force Kira to return home and instead of being a military  officer she must become make clay birds - it's true.
