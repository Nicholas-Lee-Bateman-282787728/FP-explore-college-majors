7305014,1,B0104WZKK8,"My 1 year old just opened this for Christmas, and was so so excited!! Then we put it in the DVD player and there is no picture past the menu, only sound. He was so sad, ,it made it cry! Thanks amazon, Merry Christmas (insert sarcasm here). I need to know how to go about returning this order, this isn't what I paid for.",1514332800,,320,4.015625

7305018,2,B0104WZKK8,"I am pretty sure this is a pirated DVD, albeit a decent one. Usually you cannot skip through the anti-piracy warnings on genuine DVDs, but you can for this one. The sound also changes significantly during the intro and the color isn't as great as it could be (contrast is a little high). Also, on two of the discs, when I try to select ""Play All,"" it proceeds to take me to a list of all the episodes for me to select. It does play fine though... no skipping or glitches. So it's either a fake copy or terrible production by Nickelodeon. That all being said, my son doesn't seem to care about whether or not it's poor quality. He loves it.",1508457600,,639,4.245901639344262

7305038,3,B0104WZKK8,Meh... shipping was great! Super fast! No issues with the packages integrity. When you play the dvds they are super pixilated and picture quality is poor.

We thought we'd get it for our younger daughter and ordered it for Christmas. For all intents and purposes, it plays fine, but it's terribly pixelated in spots and just generally a poor quality DVD.  This is the second time we've gotten an ""on-demand"" DVD from Amazon with problems, and will probably be steering clear of them from now on.",1514851200,,475,4.459770114942529
