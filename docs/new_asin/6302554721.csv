480270,3,6302554721,"I remember seeing the movie & thinking how funny it was. A black actor witnesses a crime being committed & dresses up & pretends to be a white man.

However, unless you have a region 2 DVD player or a region free player, don't get this on DVD. I bought this only to realize that this is a region 2 disc.",1366848000,,303,3.9672131147540983
480271,4,6302554721,"This movie was showing on t.v one day and it turned out to be hilarious. I couldn't believe that I'd never seen or heard of it, growing up in the 90s. I enjoyed it so much I bought it on DVD. Lenny Henry is a genius and the movie is so underrated. What more can I say? The story-line is quite original. It's hard to make a film with a black male lead without it becoming cliched. Funnily enough, that's one of the main ideas explored in the movie (Lenny Henry is a stage actor looking for work). It's quirky and interesting and keeps you on your toes. The characters are laugh-out-loud funny- from the various mafia guys to Lenny's nerdy makeup artist side-kick. Lenny's mafia persona and other impersonations he does are hilarious. I'm surprised he didn't do more in Hollywood. Good, fun movie- clean jokes and very invocative of the 90s.",1313712000,,839,4.490196078431373
480272,3,6302554721,"I actually bought this copy for a film festival I held for a special anniversary last year.  It is actually not a bad film, but because Disney invested heavily on Lenny Henry to strike it big here in the U.S.A. as he is big in his native England, only to fail to do so as a result of this film's box office shortcomings,he was unable to get the toehold here in the States to make it last.  This film, which shows off the acting--and comedic--talents of Henry, gives a taste of what might have been if the film had been more accepted in 1991. A good chance for director Charles Lane, who plays his make-up designer bud as well.  Frank Langella does right in his role as a gangster in hiding--a mature albeit still-beautiful Peggy Lipton is phine as his wife. Anne-Marie Johnson makes a fine love interest for Lenny. The late J.T. Walsh, in a good-guy turn, delivers as an F.B.I. agent looking to bring in Langella's mobster character. And James Earl Jones has a poignant cameo as well.  Not such a bad way to go for a Blockbuster kind of retro-night. Check it out.  (This turned out to be a PAL copy, but with a code-free DVD player, you can make it happen!!!!)",1246233600,3,1160,4.376744186046512

480274,1,6302554721,"Another film from the early 90's that tries to make a stand on Hip-Hop comedy but this film falls short and doesn't deliver any good performances. Lenny Henry the star of this dumb film plays an aspiring actor who witnesss  a mafia hit and changes his identity of a black man to a white man who  poses as a hitman himself and the film follows in disaray after that.  Henry's work on Brittish Television is nothing that hillarous either. The  idea is weak and the story is bland, the only real quality in this picture  is Frank Langella his performace as the demeaning mafia don is played very  well, but he was in his prime when he was ""DRACULA"" This film is  pretty much ""DUMB & BORING""",964137600,,687,4.362204724409449

Lenny Henry is awesome in all his impersonations.  The movie is just out right funny, movie viewers give it ago you will enjoy it as well.  I am glad I was able to locate it.  It put a smile on my face.  Thanks Lenny for sharing your talent with me.",1473552000,,399,4.0
7827534,5,6302554721,I love this movie so much! It's not overly long and the characters are awesome! I remember this would come on TV when I was a kid and my mom used to borrow the VHS. I had no idea until recently that Lenny Henry is British. He's definitely talented!,1461888000,,248,4.081632653061225

7827538,4,6302554721,"I found this movie by chance going through discounted VHS tapes and thought I'd give it a watch. I was very pleasantly surprised, tt was a very good movie considering the budget and handling it received. I like comedys but don't really find too many movies that give me a real hard laugh, but this movie had many really funny scenes. I'd never heard of Lenny Henry before and it's too bad he was so mis-managed, he could have had a very successful carreer, he is very talented. The story line was okay (there aren't many new or original story lines under the sun these days) and the acting was more than adequate. The makeup job on Henry is pretty good and his imitation of a mobster type is good too. Frank Langella does a great job as usual along with most of the remaining cast. This movie is definitely worthy of a re-release on DVD.",1408147200,,837,4.371794871794871
