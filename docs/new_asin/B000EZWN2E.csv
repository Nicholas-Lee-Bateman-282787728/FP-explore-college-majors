8116026,3,B000EZWN2E,The program comes in CDs only. it would be more convenient if it was in downloadable format.,1408060800,,92,4.470588235294118
8116027,1,B000EZWN2E,I think that it is terrible.  The woman is such a boring speaker that it is hard to pay attention to the content.,1404777600,2,113,3.9130434782608696
8116028,3,B000EZWN2E,"I like to download and use the resources provided.  I couldn't do so.  I already have ADOBE Reader X installed in my system.  When you load the CD it says you have to load Adobe Reader 9 and gives you the option to do so or quit.  Well If I've already got X why do I want to install 9.  I had to go into the disc and manually find it.  Not very good or efficient use of resources.  This should be fixed.
The CD itself seems to be as advertised.",1403568000,2,444,3.8131868131868134

8116030,3,B000EZWN2E,Some of the information is good but I was expecting much more.  This book is really geared toward sales people although the hype does not say that.,1400716800,4,147,4.444444444444445
8116031,3,B000EZWN2E,"Received this set, and was not able to review immediately.  Just started last week, and there was a skip error on CD 1, but now that i am on CD 2, there are multiple skips.  Not happy that I paid this much for a defective copy.  Will continue to listen to the remaining  CD's and determine if this first listening session was a fluke and the rest are OK.  I like the content so far, but haven't reached the WOW yet.",1398124800,2,415,4.074074074074074
