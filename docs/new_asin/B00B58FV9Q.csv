5557151,5,B00B58FV9Q,"As a parent, I find Yo Gabba Gabba to be oddly entertaining ... and also educational.  In general, YGG DVD's are repetitive (music), which is great for toddlers, with flashy characters, colors and images, and lots of music and movement.  It's strange and quite different from the more common animated shows my daughter watches but YGG is one of hers and my favorites.  This particular DVD has several 'episodes' - not just Meet Muno's Family.  (It is only Muno's family you meet - not the other characters, which my 4 year old was slightly bummed about!)  I can't recommend Gabba enough and this DVD does not disappoint.  They hit on typical subjects like manners, sharing, greetings, etc.",1436832000,2,689,4.846153846153846

5557259,4,B00B58FV9Q,"So my daughter loves this show more than I can even convey in this review. I on the other hand, think the show is bizarre and find it an assault on my auditory senses. The songs grate on my nerves and the character's voices are super annoying. It's nice that I can pop in the DVD for a bit and get some cleaning done while my 2 year old is entertained so that alone is worth the annoyance.",1339718400,,389,4.0

The clothes are extremely hard to find, and even if you have Amazon Prime you still have to pay for episodes. My wish would be for all the seasons to be available on DVD, but until then, we will settle for these compilation DVDs to sing along with the Yo Gabba Gabba gang we love so dearly.",1465344000,,455,4.010989010989011
