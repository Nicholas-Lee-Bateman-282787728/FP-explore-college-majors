2338855,5,B0009YA3OA,"This is a must see thriller film for all fans and non fans of the genre. There are so many twists and turns to keep you on your toes, you are left guessing every one is the killer except the real killer. Its a gritty film with great sfx effects, which may not be for the faint hearted. There is a great cast line up including Val Kilmer and LL cool J. The only fault i have is that ive found out its not due for any UK release soon.

2338875,4,B0009YA3OA,"Disc has some scratches in it. Supposed to have been a new disc... SOLD BY & SHIPPED BY Amazon.com, I believe is what it said when I ordered it. The movie skipped and froze a couple of times while I was watching it. I really DO NOT want to have to return it because it took me 12 YEARS to find this movie and Amazon.com is the ONLY place I found it at. I really like this movie, it's a great movie. Why does a disc that is supposed to be brand new have a bunch of knicks and scratches in it ? I am wondering if there is a way that I can get the disc resurfaced so it will play better. I usually do not have a problem with stuff I buy from Amazon.com. All the other movies and / or CDs I have bought in the past, from Amazon.com, have worked perfectly fine. Just a little irritating that this movie doesn't play well because it is scratched. 4 Stars because of this issue !",1486252800,,872,3.9322033898305087

I was leery about watching because I've seen some of Val Kilmer's recent work where he has trotted out some poor acting skills.  Kilmer has very little screen time in this one but did well in his roll.  I think anyone watching this will be pleasantly surprised.  Also, unlike many of the movies made these days where it just seems to end and leave you thinking, ""that's it?"" this this movie has a nicely rounded-out ending.

I'd recommend this for anyone who likes Whodunits.",1472947200,,567,4.62

2338909,2,B0009YA3OA,"The premise was full of possibilities but the makers of this movie decided to have the characters resemble an overwrought group of teenagers rather than professional FBI agents. Some of the victims were so annoying I was hoping the clock would run out for them so I wouldn't have to watch their histrionics anymore. This was almost a one star but since I didn't have to pay anything to see it and the three or four times the group was actually using their brains and trying to figure out who-done-it and not overreacting by pulling their weapons on each other, it was not horrible. Faint praise. Don't waste your time or money.",1467763200,,627,4.607142857142857

2338915,5,B0009YA3OA,"Good suspense, with some chilling scenes. Is there a bad guy nobody knows about?  Is it one of the ""good"" guys? Keeps you guessing until the last couple of minutes.

2338926,4,B0009YA3OA,"Cleaning the house the other day, I found a dusty DVD of Mindhunters that's been kicked under a rug. Just for shucks and giggles, I watched it. Guess what? It's pretty good. It's a genre hybrid that encompasses psychological suspense and survival horror. For an obscure film, its cast brags some pretty decent names.

The plot strands a small group of FBI trainees on Oneiga Island, a spooky, deserted naval training facility 150 miles off-shore what's been temporarily ceded to the FBI. These brainy agents - joined by a detective (LL Cool J) from Philly PD sent there to observe - have a weekend to investigate and solve a simulated murder scene, this the final training exercise in their try at making profiler. So, how shocked are you when the trainees start getting picked off one by one?

For folks supposedly adept at getting inside the mind of a serial killer, our FBI guys lose their sh-- faster than a twitchy Colonial Marine on the exomoon, LV-426. It's disappointing. It's what drags the movie down more than anything - how the cast behaves in such clichd fashion. Not too long before they panic and run around and scream at each other and point their guns at each other. Silly rabbits.

The two leads, you'd think, should be Val Kilmer (he's the jerk instructor) and Christian Slater (he's the take charge guy). They're the biggest names. They are not the two leads. Instead, it's Kathryn Morris and Johnny Lee Miller. And I guess, in a case like this, who better to take the bull by the horns than Lilly Rush from CBS's Cold Case and Sherlock Holmes himself? Morris plays Sara Moore who has a rep for choking under pressure. Miller - a Brit trying on a southern twang - plays Sara's staunchest defender, Lucas. But, really, it's Sara toward whom we gravitate.

Its premise borrows from Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. It's a thinking man's slasher movie. The Puppeteer is a killer who'd rather not get his hands dirty. He's one of them twisted gents who prefers to manipulate events so that it's the victims themselves who stupidly deliver their own very nasty coup de grce. And that's when the movie scores big - with the Puppeteer's ingenious methods of disposal. The booby traps are of the fiendish persuasion. The kills are achieved in gruesome and novel fashion. It's almost too much. It begs for an even sturdier suspension of disbelief. It begs the question just when did the killer find the time to slip away to stage such ridiculously elaborate death traps, the early ones, anyway? Much of the killer's pulling it off depended hugely on perfect timing, a consummate knack for mechanics, and an acute awareness of his prey's psyche. Me, I get a headache trying to come up with such clever, diabolical plots. But, as we learn, it's how the Puppeteer gets his rocks off.

Sure, a lot of the characters are underdeveloped. Like the girl with the cigarette fixation. Or the wheelchaired guy who doesn't go anywhere without his gun. Or the showoff. These aren't character traits as much as they are weaknesses the killer readily exploits. Kathryn Morris is the only actor whose role is given solid treatment. Meanwhile, LL Cool J as the tough-talking Det. Gabe Jensen toes the line between cop caricature and enigmatic authority figure. Mindhunters is LL's reunion with director Renny Harlin, both cats having worked on the campy yet tremendously fun oceanic horror, Deep Blue Sea.

You have to play along if you want to have fun with this movie. People will do stupid things - like turn on each other THAT fast or like the girl with that cigarette pack that shoots out of the vending machine. There are plot inconsistensies - like, would the helicopter just take off with the survivor(s) in lieu of sticking around to secure the crime scenes? But, damn, the acting is decent, never mind that the script compel the actors to act the fool. There are red herrings galore. I guessed the identity of the serial killer halfway thru the film, so maybe they could've camouflaged the perpetrator better. But, oh, man, there's the creepy atmosphere. Oneiga Island, with its scattering of security cameras and posed mannequins, gave me the heebie-jeebies. And the film's bread and butter - the gnarly and very creative kills - makes this such a righteous watch. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1455494400,3,4300,4.76510067114094
2338927,1,B0009YA3OA,"This movie is horrible. The acting is terrible. The first person to be killed could have easily survived by taking half a step to the left or right. The other deaths are equally idiotic. The fallacies in the characters statements are laughable.

2338930,5,B0009YA3OA,"This was a movie I could watch more than once which is why I bought it. The suspense factor is just right, there is no wasted time in the movie in which the scene needs to be set, and the characters unfold as the story does- with layers being pulled back, one at a time. In this way it makes it so that I am always reevaluating the characters. The movie opens with high intensity and never really let's you come back down from from that platform until the credits are rolling. One of my favorites.",1435622400,,497,4.1875

2338933,5,B0009YA3OA,"The U.S. was the last place this movie premiered back in 2005.  It wasn't well received, garnering mostly negative criticism for a plot that borrowed too heavily from the Agatha Christie classic, And Then There Were None.  In this case, a group of FBI students are brought to a small island and left to fend for themselves against a psychotic killer in their midst.  As with most slasher flicks, they are picked off one at a time.  Yes, this plot has been overused a lot.  Fortunately, I didn't find that a problem.  In fact, I counted on it sticking to the formula.  It's a plot device I enjoy.  And familiarity doesn't preclude a requisite amount of excitement and action, not to mention the creative kill sequences (where else are you going to get to see Christian Slater literally go to pieces?).  As their numbers rapidly dwindle, it isn't long before they turn on each other like rabid dogs (I couldn't help but think do we really want any of these people working for the FBI?).

Not a bad thriller, I liked that it unraveled rather quickly.  It's a definite keeper!",1432598400,,1072,4.589473684210526
2338934,4,B0009YA3OA,"The cast of Mind Hunters is as weird and diverse as any movie can get, but what turned me on to this film was the fact that it was Directed by Renny Harlin. Harlin is a legend in the world of action films, responsible for such films as Die Hard 2, 12 Rounds, & The Long Kiss Goodnight. He usually doesn't waste his time on direct-to-video films, and prefers to feature his own people, but the story here was so good, that he must of made an exception. Mind Hunters follows seven FBI agents who are training to be profilers, under the watch of the toughest trainer there ever was, Jake Harris (Val Kilmer). For their final test, the group goes to a small island the navy uses for training, and must work together in order to catch a serial killer that doesn't exist or do they? Once they begin their investigation, the group quickly come to realize that the scene is booby trapped and they are cut off from the outside world, trapped on an island with a killer. While having a unique location and a terrific director, what I really enjoyed about this film was how it was more than just some slasher film. This group isn't just a bunch of frat girls running from a guy in a hockey mask, they are trained, intelligent, FBI agents, trying to figure out which one of them is responsible for setting the rest up. This film features all the fighting, gun battles, and chases that you get in a typical action thriller, but there is also a methodical obsession among the group to find the one that betrayed them, and for that this film is unique. Kathryn Morris stars and has more than enough experience playing a detective, after sever years on Cold Case. Likewise LL Cool J has played a cop on numerous occasions, most recently on NCIS: Los Angles. Going into the film, I wasn't all that crazy about this cast, but once I got into it, I realized that they were brought together, because all of these guys have plays cops, FBI agents, or some kind of law enforcer in the past. That mix of unique personalities and experience help this film, because what the cast lacks in talent, they make up for with experience. Mind Hunters isn't something you've never seen before, but it brings together several different common themes in a new way and it will keep you on the edge of your seat.",1432512000,,2275,4.4319809069212415

It has the Slasher-esque one by one kills and some very good gore effects and kills,it also has a Saw feel to it as the killer sets elaborate killing traps .The cast was great featuring Clifton Collins Jr, L.L. Cool J ,Christian Slater , Val Kiilmer and a few other familiar faces.

This allows the movie producers to claim two big-name stars are in the movie, while in reality the movie is full of amateurs.  That saves a bundle of money.

Other than misrepresenting the acting talent, this is not an FBI cop movie, either.  It is just another variation on the haunted house or house of horrors movie, filled with all sorts of tricky ways to hack and slash and dismember people.  It is pretty sick in that regard.

Can you guess who is killing all these totally unconvincing FBI agents?  Can you guess who is next to die?  Can you guess who the real killer is?  Duh, who cares?  Most of us gave up playing ""Clue"" when we were little kids at summer camp.

And of course we have the required stock of politically correct diversity characters: one white female, one Hispanic female, one black male, a couple white males, and just for good measure one paraplegic in a wheelchair who apparently has a speech impediment.

The FBI is testing people for their skill in discovering a murderer. They are placed on a deserted island that has many buildings which can conceal a murderer. They begin their search, and soon find a murder victim. It is one of these agents! The search reveals no one else on the island. The murderer must be one of the test subjects? But which one?

As bodies are found the list of suspects is narrowed done to a few. Who will be the last agent standing? Will he or she be the guilty party? [Who came up with this story anyhow?] In time the remaining agents figure out who the killer is. [Did you have a clue as to the identity of the murderer before it was revealed?] Be sure to see this from the very beginning to understand the background of this story.

I remember watching the first death scene, and thinking 'this doesn't make any rational sense, but the movie concept is good, maybe the rest of the actions scenes will be better.' I was very wrong. The thing that stands out most about this movie is that all of the death scenes are just plain ridiculous- either they wouldn't logically work, or there would be a very rational solution to the problem if you are the intended victim.

The overall plot is not bad, but the problem comes in when the ending pops out of nowhere with no real clues or foreshadowing in the beginning. Most people who like mystery movies/novels want some clues that they can connect. You will not find that in this movie.

The interactions between the characters are also a big problem. Every conversation is overly dramatic and conflictual.

I recommend this movie only if you want to watch it as a spoof of mind-twisters and can enjoy the unintentional humor.",1290297600,,1176,4.507042253521127

it. Just kidding. It wasn't that bad, however, the acting was average, the stunts were

mostly computer gen, except for one scene of the most fittest middle aged black man

on screen to date(LL Cool J) in a fist fight with either Slater, or Johnny Lee Miller(sorry I

can't even remember that much of the plot, as there wasn't  many memorable scenes

that I could recall).
  And Val K. looks like he(excuse the pun) ""telephoned in his acting"").

  The settings were the norm, the usual settings for people being

stalked,killed,maimed,mutilated(eg old abandoned warehouses).

  I have to admit the  music kept it on the edge and suspenseful.

  The special effects were kind of cool. I won't give away any key

points, but the effects were generally minimal, with some nice computer

generated effects, and traditional hollywood effects (except for a

couple of cool Saw-type effects tricks, nothing real unusual was

done).
  The actors themselves were along for the ride , almost like the first

Alien movie where the actors had no clue what is going to happen in some

scenes (thanks to the sneaky tactics/directing  of the movie director.

  And the plot is somewhat predictable as most of Rennie Harlins

movies have been in the past(eg. Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, that Pirate

movie).

  Here are a couple of other movies that I suggest if you want good

character development and these are:

-Identity
-Copycat
-Secret Window
-Panic Room.

 Also, please watch any of these old classic ones from the

past which are great movies:

-Ten Little Indians
-The Cat and the Canary
-Clue
-The House on Haunted Hill(The original version with Vincent Price please)

  Other Rennie Harlin movies with better plot  and less cheese:

-""The Long Kiss Goodnight""

-Exorcist: The Beginning (Directing after director Frankenheimmer died, which was a remake of  a superior version by Paul Schrader : Dominion: A
Prequel to The Exorcist.

Then, while these are highly trained profilers, once under pressure, they stop doing their highly sophisticated profiler talk and instead fall back into the stereotype Hollywood movie trapped prey behavior of shutting off their brain and just accusing the next person of being the killer without thought or reason.

On the stylish side, I thought the soundtrack was getting in the way of making this a serious suspense movie, instead turning it into an MTV extreme sport feature. Val Kilmer and Christian Slater have actually very short appearances in this film, maybe they thought it better to leave the sinking ship. The remaining actors are mostly two-dimensional, and instead of acting scared (which they should have been) or at least disturbed, they mostly go their ways like it is still an exercise and they will come out unscathed.

If the traps hadn't been so elaborate (and thus unbelievable), this could have been decent entertainment.  If the music had been more supporting of the moods, the stylish factor would have been adequate. If the actors had been reacting like humans, this could have risen beyond B material.",1194220800,2,1351,4.860869565217391
2339119,3,B0009YA3OA,"The Not-Too-Revealing Synopsis:

A class of elite FBI students are given mock crimes to analyze and profile.  When a test becomes dangerous the students start to question their teacher and each other.

Review:

The scenario drew my interest:  a whole group of promising mindhunters working together. The possibilities were many - who will they take on?  what could a group do that a single profiler could not?  Disappointingly a bulk of the movie takes place in one limited location and the group-possiblity is never played out.  It is completely a guess-the-bad-guy kind of movie with a score of misdirections and twists thrown in.  If you  enjoy guessing at who done it and what will happen next then it is a thrilling movie.  The dangers and scenarios are implausible and simply do not make sense in the context of the characters and their professions though so you will ruin it for yourself if question the plot or characters on any level.  I would not suggest watching it if you are only  interested in seeing Val Kilmer or Christian Slater as their screen time is limited.

Before long, they notice that their excercise is turning into real fight for survival.  One of them is a killer, only no one knows who it is.  As each profilers is offed every 5 minutes in the very innovative way (no two murders are the same and some are quite psychopatic), we are kept at the edge of our seat trying to figure out which one is the real killer.  Moral of the story - even the FBI can let a sociopath slip into their ranks...Unless you are in the mood to waste your time, do not watch this movie.",1191974400,,782,4.214765100671141
2339121,4,B0009YA3OA,"Such a film is to be discovered directly. There is no possible summarizing it without destroying its force and its effect. Let's say seven young FBI agents are being trained to become profilers. The teacher is harsh with them because he seems to find them too weak. The last test is to drop them on a totally abandoned and deserted island announcing there is a serial killer with them. And they have three or four days to profile him or her, and what's more they have a chaperon from the Department of Justice. Good luck, Good bye and Good adventure ahead. And they discover very fast there is a serial killer among them, but they do not know who. And there everything goes wrong for them. Thank you Agatha Christie and her ""Ten Little N****s"" (sorry we cannot quote the real word in politically correct English, can we?), or ""Murder By Death"" used as models. The details are in the film. The film demonstrates how these young agents have none of the necessary qualities to become profilers, and particularly the capacity to remain cool, cold and self controlled if they don't want to fall in the traps the serial killer is laying in front of them. And lose their cool they all will, dramatically and pay for their mistake with their lives. But the best profiler of them all is absent, it is the teacher who had profiled the serial killer among them and knew this one will not stop at anything at all to be the only one to survive and get the degree. But we could wonder if that is not a subtle way of being a killer too: by using the unconscious and unsolicited services of a real killer to prove his point: these young people are not serious future profilers and have to be eliminated. And that brings the film to the level of a metaphor of society. Only the best one survives any test, or the survivor of an elimination game is the best one. True or False? The film leans towards true. I think it could have been slightly more subtle.

Stars: Eion Bailey, Val Kilmer, Christian Slater

Spoiler Alert. Yes well hard to tell you anything at all without giving away a little about the movie. A group of a half dozen FBI agents are landed on a military training island for a profiling exercise over the weekend. There is an agent along for the ride that is watching their instructor's (Val Kilmer) methods of training. Now throw in a clever killer with deadly traps in their midst. A killer that somehow got onto a military installation that is far from the mainland.  Eliminate their means to call for help until the helicopter returns on Monday. So a training mission becomes one of survival. Can they figure out who is responsible before they are all dead? Sound familiar? Have you seen ""Ten Little Indians"" or ""And Then There Were None""? This story seems very similar to the Agatha Christie book and subsequent movies but only in premise.  There is far more excitement to this modern thriller.

I had seen this a couple years ago and thought it was good. Now that I go back and revisit it I've decided it has stood the test of time and remained good. It was quite entertaining to see it again. The cast is recognizable, in fact some fairly well known. The outcome however is not what I would call predictable, well sure we all know almost everyone is going to die. But we don't know is whose doing it and why, and who will survive. If I have any complaint it is they don't start profiling the killer until a few are dead already. I suppose you could say they were to much in a state of shock after the first two grisly deaths. This movie is not for the squemish. The deaths are graphicly gory. If you can stomach that though you may be pleasantly surprised.

They are told that in the morning they would find the first victim of a serial killer. And these FBI profilers-in-training have three days to profile the serial killer through the clues that are left behind. The problem is the next day as they start their investigation; one of their own is killed. And they learn that someone who has been taught to capture serial killers has become one. The killer leaves a clue each time on exactly what time the next person will die. They just do not know who the killer is or who will be the next victim.

2339142,4,B0009YA3OA,"It's fun reviewing a Renny Harlin film because--technically speaking--we have both worked with the same actor.  In his film The Long Kiss Goodnight, he cast Guiseppe ""Joe"" Pingue as  a bartender (okay, you only see that actor for a second and he has no lines, but he's done more since), and when I was studying Playwrighting in University, I cast Joe in a comedy I wrote.  The difference: years later, I bumped into Joe and he said ""Seth, you still wrote the best part I ever played."".  I bet he didn't say that to Mr. Harlin!  Ha, in your face!

But enough about the great acting roles of Joe Pingue.  Let's talk about Mindhunters.

Agatha Christie's novel Ten Little Indians (aka And Then There Were None, among other things) is the first grown-ups' novel I remember reading, probably when I was about ten years old.  It had a lasting effect on me, and it shaped the way I look at plot, and its importance.  A clever plot is a great starting point from which to flow, and suspense can be a lot of fun.  It remains a favourite novel of mine, and it's no surprise that some of my other favourite mystery novels are books like The False Inspector Dew, by Peter Lovesey, and Dancing Aztecs, by Donald Westlake.  Looking at Ten Little Indians now, I recognize that there is another aspect to it that is not to do with the clever plot to end all plots--This is also the ancestor to all those movies we have now where a roster of characters, usually dopey teenagers, have to die in increasingly bizarre ways to shock the audience.  So if those horror films, like Final Destination and Saw, are grade-B entertainment or worse, then I must dismiss  Agatha Christie's masterpiece as shlock, fluff, silliness.  I don't think I can do that, because it's so brilliantly constructed and executed, but can I do that with the film Mindhunters?

Well, Mindhunters is essentially Ten Little Indians with more gore and cool fights: an isolated group of people being killed off one by one, by one of their own number.  Even the final trick owes something to a crucial bit of legerdemain near the end of the Christie book.  The deaths are horrific throughout, giving this film a sort of over-the-top, not-quite-serious taste, as if the director is ultimately pandering to the ghouls.  The deathtraps do overshadow the cleverness needed to keep the audience guessing, and the subtlety that becomes the underbelly of the film.  The viewer is even harder to fool once the roster of suspects is down to, say, three or two--but then of course you have to pick up the pace even more, jump between the characters while they are in situations that still paint them as either victim or murderer, and slip that final little deception under the door.

This story, in whatever form, can never be totally believable.  I admit that Renny Harlin can be heavy-handed in technique--but in his case, the ham-fistedness is not so much a weakness in and of itself.  It's more like it sabotages, or at least masks, the subtler aspects of his craft.  Turning Ten Little Indians into a horror show--turning it into Mindhunters-- means less likelihood of attracting a mature audience, because the plot itself is already wild, over-the-top, straining credibility.  So much in this film is geared towards bringing it back down to Earth: subtle lighting, a bit of hip humour, believable acting, music that works but doesn't overpower, that the result is even more strange.  But I think it offers a very suspenseful film, that is not quite like Ten Little Indians, and not quite like Final Destination 3, and not quite like Seven, and for that matter, not quite like any other Renny Harlin film.  If you are a horror fan, or a mystery fan, you might want to take a look at Mindhunters.

The bonus features on the DVD are mostly a waste of time, except for the Director's Commentary option.  Though Renny Harlin's commentary does not necessarily tie into whatever scene is playing--he basically talks about whatever aspect of making the film he wants to, whenever he feels like it--he will occasionally check in with what's specifically being shown, and he has a sense of humour.  I think he's an interesting filmmaker , but I do tend towards escapist, summer entertainment that puts me on the edge of my seat...meaning that I enjoyed this film, plus Cliffhanger, plus Die Hard 2, plus especially Deep Blue Sea.  I don't know if this director can make a movie that relies only on subtlety and the low-key approach, but his strange balancing of over-the-top action and suspense, with some subtle touches, creates films with their own unique stamp.  And anything unique is good, even if you're starting with an old Agatha Christie plot.",1168214400,,4686,4.732758620689655
2339143,2,B0009YA3OA,"Mindhunters is a mediocre blend of Seven and Saw.

I really liked Seven, particularly because it took time to develop the main characters. This is not because I think all movies should be literary with fully fleshed out characters but because I think that thrillers are more thrilling when I personally like the characters. Unfortunately, I didn't really care for any of the characters in the Mindhunters and the movie soon unraveled into an erratic tempo of feints, double feints, and double double double feints, like Saw, but not anywhere near as good.

There was even a taste of CSI in this movie, and the taste did nothing but remind me of how great CSI is and how this multi-million dollar movie doesn't even measure up to one television show.

To its credit, Mindhunters pulls out all the stops: diabolical traps, DNA forensics, human meat hooks, slo-mo stud walks, and even some super-genius numerical sequences to decipher, but in the end, it's all just a big giant mess.

2339145,3,B0009YA3OA,"Before I watched this movie I was hoping for some ""quiet-earth""-like pictures as the plot is about some FBI guys who get to a deserted island that serves as a training ground. They put up a live role playing game, during which they have to solve a murder. There's Val Kilmer as the guy who thinks out the scenarios. Everything is as real as possible, with blood and finger prints, there's an office with gadgets free for use. Kilmer's character introduces them to the scenario and then leaves the island like everyone else so that the FBI rookies are all on their own. The test will take 3 days after which they must have solved the puzzle.

The scenario is great for sure, I partly got what I was wishing for in terms of isolation. There's a ghost town there with wasted cars etc. and the rest is deserted and foggy. The story soon turns out to be very Final Destination like. One FBI rookie after another drops like flies. The killer pre-informs them about the exact time when it will happen. Nobody knows who's next, nobody trusts the other which is played out in a very cliched manner. They're always in a hurry, it's like they get the clue some minutes before the mentioned time and when the time comes, they all quietly watch each other and the environment. Sometimes there's a real chain reaction that will kill the next person at its end.

It's a nice, paranoid thriller flick from Hollywood with surprisingly gory, mostly impossible deaths.

I see how some people can THINK this is a better movie than it is because they either choose to ignore physics violations or don't have enough knowledge to know when they exist.  Potential spoilers ahead!!!  Canisters of high pressure gas do not remain stationary when they fall over and the cap comes off - Equal and opposite reaction.  Severed heads do not fall backward when someone is sitting with their head down and they get pulled up from the shoulder - Gravity - And, of course this was no trap but a contrivance just to shock the audience and in my opinion violated the premise of the movie.  From thirty feet away, someone can tell that someone died from smoking acid-laced cigarettes - Give me a break.

This movie tries and apparently, based on some reviews, successfully, to con the audience into thinking these so-called inventive ways of killing people are plausible but I think they are ridiculous at best.  In the non-clever attempted electrocution scene, if the power had NOT been turned off, how could the next trap of turning off the water have occurred.  This movie could be picked apart ad infinitum but those that don't require suspension of disbelief can enjoy it immensely.  In the very first scene there were blanks that shattered glasses, plates or whatever and agents falling down ""dead"" as if they would know when to do that as if it was real, but it was obvious that the desire was to fool the audience instead maintaining plausibility.

The acting which was decent, to a certain extent, kept the movie from stalling entirely although I felt that Val Kilmer and Christian Slater were sorely under used.

Man, Renny Harlin could screw anything up. He's like the Tibor Takacs of feature films. Here, he takes an amazing cast, a script that starts off worthwhile, and some excellent possibilities, and tosses them all into the trash without a second thought.

Harris (Val Kilmer) is a trainer of FBI profilers. As their final exam, he takes eight of them, along with Gabe Jensen (LL Cool J), a profiler from Philadelphia, out to a remote island where he's set up a crime scenfor them to profile over the course of a weekend. There is a problem, however; there's a real serial killer on the island (and if you've watched a trailer or two, you know it's one of the people to whom we've already been introduced), leading to a lot of deaths and rampant paranoia.

What could have been a fine psychological thriller is, instead, turned into a rather silly excuse to come up with inventive ways to kill people. The most tension you're going to feel is in figuring out how the next person is going to die; it was done, and far better, in Final Destination.

The film does sport some decent performances, most notably those of LL Cool J and Val Kilmer, which save it from being entirely unwatchable.

2339167,3,B0009YA3OA,"Imagine you want to be an elite FBI profiler. You train hard, and your next (and last) assignment given by the unconventional teacher (Val Kilmer) is to go to a deserted island for the next weekend, and spend the days with other potential profilers there, in order to do profiling. What actually happens to you is the real killing done in the most elaborated and cruel way.

[IT'S NOT ABOUT MIND ACTUALLY] Though titled as `Mindhunters,' the film is not exactly about `mind.' It is about hunting in an isolated situation, and the familiar Agatha Christie-like premise is recycled for this serial killing thriller directed by `Renny Harlin best known for blockbuster actions like `Die Hard 2' and `Cliffhanger.' Each death is here presented not for giving hints for whodunit, but for the most contrived and often repellent shocks.

Harlin manages to keep us guessing who is the real killer (or killers?) not by the logics, but by the quick succession of (cheap) thrills using interesting items like dominos. Keep in mind that Harlin's films have never been associated with words like delicacy and sensitivity - let me remind you he is the director of `The Adventures of Ford Fairlane' and `Driven' - but that's exactly why `Mindhunters' work for me.

Usually this kind of film is not praised for the acting of the players, but Kathryn Morris as `Sara' apparently the weakest candidate for FBI agent, gives strong performance. Other actors LL Cool J, Jonny Lee Miller, Val Kilmer, Christian Slater, Patricia Velasquez, Clifton Collins Jr., Eion Bailey, and Will Kemp are all good.

The film's insistence on the death traps might be off-putting to some, but mostly the film is a so-so popcorn entertainment. Of course the story is impossible in reality, and the motive behind the murders is nothing convincing. However, as one of the characters say, the film is all about `What's the trap? Where's the trap?' And these traps, more elaborately-crafted ones than in `House of Wax,' are done pretty well, but I warn you, some of you may find them disgusting.",1141171200,,2052,4.904899135446686

As far as other reviewers claiming the finale was too predictable, I guess if you pay extremely close attention then you'll catch it, but for those of you who go to a  movie to ENJOY it rather than take notes like there's a quiz on it the next day, you probably won't know what hit you when it gets there.

I enjoyed this movie a lot, and besides a mystery and thriller, it may also be classified as a horror movie, but not with the typical killer with a costume, you have to use your head in this movie.

It's actually very exciting when they find new watches and that time comes on, because you don't know what could happen, because they all die in different ways. You are going to have a great time watching this movie and you won't felt that you were sit on a chair watching it for over an hour and a half.

It's like this, the characters in this movie are constantly trying to figure out who among them is the killer. What really annoyed me is how every single time they think they they've got their man (or woman), they all act with this stupid air of certainty as if there is absolutely no way in a million years they could possibly be wrong. Isn't this what you thought last time? Didn't you just get done accusing someone else, only to turn up wrong, and one of your colleagues DEAD wrong? Why reach such a steadfast conclusion on inconclusive evidence? They should've had the characters show a tiny bit more hesitancy when it came to accusing people, and that would've made all the difference in the world in terms of believability, and I wouldn't be writing this.

2339174,4,B0009YA3OA,"When watching a movie like ""Mindhunters,"" it's necessary not to hunt for one's mind, but to put it on hold. This is a trashy, silly movie, full of time-worn clichs, red herrings, twisted deaths, gunplay, shouting, dead cats, and a nude shower scene. The plot is an excuse to jerk the viewer around, to tease and tantalize: which of these likable characters is really a murderous psycho? Everyone is a suspect, but when the killer is finally revealed, we roll our eyes and throw popcorn at the screen. It's trash. And yet....it entertains. It has a talented, if largely unknown, cast. It has mood, suspense, excitement. It's directed by Renny Harlin, who knows and adores the genre. And sometimes it's fun to be jerked around.

""Mindhunters"" is the latest high-tech update of the ""Closed Room"" mystery popularized by Agatha Christie: the characters are stuck in an isolated location, cut off from the rest of the world, and they're being killed one by one. The killer can only be....(dramatic pause)....Someone In This Room. But he/she is clever, and he/she knows how to manipulate and divert suspicion elsewhere. But there are clues, lots of them, that I must be careful not to reveal in this review. Who will survive? Do we care? Sort of. Mostly we're just eager for the next weird, elaborate murder scenario.

The film opens as two FBI agents move in on a creepy old mansion where a serial killer may be holding two victims. As usual, this scene has little to do with the rest of the movie. We meet a small group of young agents who are training to be profilers -- those who identify and track down unknown killers. Their slightly unhinged trainer, Harris (a smirking Val Kilmer), briefs them on their final test: they will be flown to a remote island where the Navy practices disaster scenarios. The FBI is able to ""borrow"" the island, which has a fake village constructed on it (complete with fake residents), and is home to lots of feral cats. On the island, the profilers-in-training will work to solve a staged serial killer case. They will operate from the island's central compound, which contains plenty of dim rooms, rickety catwalks, firewalled computers, and elevators that move way too slowly. Because this is just a drill, they won't need guns. (Ha!) So the bright-eyed, twentysomething fools arrive on the island, spend the night, and in the morning, locate the fake murder scene -- which becomes a real murder scene when one of them springs a complicated booby trap and is killed by a blast of supercooled nitrogen. Uh-oh.

There are eight people on the island, and I am listing them in random order so as not to give you any clues. We have Vince (Clifton Collins Jr.), who is confined to a wheelchair and never goes anywhere without a gun. Nicole (Patricia Velasquez), who is trying to beat her smoking habit. Lucas (Johnny Lee Miller), who may be too brave for his own good. J.D. (Christian Slater), their cocky leader, who is having a fling with Nicole. Rafe (Will Kemp), a blond Brit with a caffeine addiction. Sara (Kathryn Morris), who is quite brainy but has an unexplained fear of water. Bobby (Eion Bailey), a techhead who is full of useful information such as the original numeric measurement for light (that comes in handy, believe me). Last but not least, Gabe (LL Cool J), an FBI agent who is on hand simply to observe training protocol. That's his story, anyway. Most of these people are doomed, and one of them is....(dramatic pause)....A Killer In Disguise.

This is a very resourceful killer. He/she is able to rig fancy and elaborate deathtraps that knock off folks in grisly ways. Even better, he/she bases his/her murders on the victim's personalities, so each character is ironically done in as a result of his or her own greatest weakness. Broken watches are left at the murder scenes, their hands set to the time of the next murder, so everyone can scramble to figure out what's going to happen. One victim's blood is drained and used to write lots of cryptic number sequences on the glass-paneled wall. A mysterious message is spelled out on the agents' jackets in ultraviolet dust. Of course, there is no way any one person could do all this stuff, not without unlimited resources, supernatural intelligence, divine luck, and way more time than the movie gives him/her, even with the drugged coffee. Who cares? I wasn't expecting a brilliant storyline.

Once the characters realize that the killer is...(dramatic pause)...Here Among Us, there's a lot of finger-pointing and people getting handcuffed to chairs while protesting their innocence. Could the murderer be Harris, who knows the island and is, after all, the token Loose Cannon Superior? Could it be Gabe, the token Unknown Outsider? Is it someone else? I was able to guess who the killer was, but it was mostly a lucky guess -- movies like this never play fair, and so it is necessary to have a suspect list that includes A) characters who seem guilty, B) characters who seem innocent, C) characters who seem dead, and D) characters who seem nonexistent. In other words, everyone. When the killer is finally unmasked, we get the usual scene where he/she gleefully explains How He/She Did It And Why, and as usual, it's really dumb. Then comes the final showdown, which has some well-staged fisticuffs but is otherwise beyond credibility. (Question: Can a woman who hasn't set foot in the water for years really hold her breath that long?)

So, yeah, it's a silly film. Not very original, either. ""Mindhunters"" not only borrows plenty from Ms. Christie and other British mystery-makers, but also from ""The Third Man"" and ""The Thing"" (there's a scene ripped straight from the latter where the characters stand around tensely and wait for the results of a DNA scan of blood taken from under a victim's fingernail). You're not going to find any great filmmaking here, and ""Mindhunters"" will probably be forgotten in another few years. But guess what? The cinematography is skillful, the directing is spot-on, and the actors are very likable and successfully stay on their feet (figuratively if not literally) in the midst of a preposterous plot. And sometimes, when all those angst-ridden, award-winning ""quality"" films get to be too much, a goofy, gory, and manipulative thrill vehicle like ""Mindhunters"" can be...(dramatic pause)...Just The Ticket.",1136851200,6,6348,4.889507892293407
2339175,4,B0009YA3OA,"This is a nice little thriller to watch wrapped up in a blanket on a cold Sunday afternoon with some good food and good company.

Honestly, I first heard about this movie a long time ago, I read about it's potential release to DVD and then I saw a trailer of it in a movie theater which only confused me more, so I am glad I finally got to see it.

The premise is about a group of eight FBI profilers who have a special assignment on an isolated island; they  know everything is at risk and want to pass the exercise, except for one thing; the task turns out into a life and  death cat and mouse game, when they realize that one of them is a sick serial killer out to kill each and every one. They find that they cannot trust one another because each one of them is smart enought to cook up a trap and they all have killer skills.

I loved the crazy traps and ways that they fell pray to, but the special effects were bit flat at times, altho I must admit I now am aware of even more ways you can die than before I saw this movie.

Great flick, that will keep you guessing to the last second, since everyone is jumpy and suspicious.",1136764800,,1132,4.03125
2339184,4,B0009YA3OA,"The Mindhunters of this film's title refer, of course, to the criminal profilers at the FBI who succeed in solving seemingly unsolvable cases through Sherlockian techniques of observation and analysis.  It's not easy to become a profiler, and only the best and the brightest make the cut and get the opportunity to prove themselves.  The final exam, dare I say it, is a real killer.  That's literally the case in this film, as a group of profilers in training find themselves facing a real-world test in which failure equates with a most painful death - their own.

I can't say I was very impressed with the profile trainees in this movie; when they start dropping like flies and pointing really scared, angry fingers at one another, logic tends to get thrown out the window.  In this respect, the story isn't all that groundbreaking - it's classic And Then There Were None material.  The filmmakers do make things interesting, though.  For example, the character I expected to last until the very end was the first to die - and that death was ingeniously done (albeit scientifically impossible as it is presented).  All but one of the deaths are, in fact, presented quite well.  The killer has imagination and a meticulous attention to detail - and that makes him/her a worthy foe.  He/she informs his/her potential victims of the time of each death, leaves them confusing little clues along the way, and polishes each of them off in impressive fashion.  The killer's also pretty difficult to identify, as events in the movie point you toward one character after another as the prime suspect.  There are only a limited number of suspects to choose from, as the action takes place on a deserted island.  Could it be Jake Harris (Val Kilmer), the profile instructor with a reputation for pushing his students too far?  He supposedly left the island, but no one actually saw him leave.  Perhaps it is the obvious suspect, Gabe Jensen (LL Cool J), an ""observer"" who joined the group at the last minute?  How about the intense, temper-prone female?  The guy in the wheelchair who refuses to give up his gun for a single second?  The fellow with the accent?  How about the disarmingly quiet Sara Moore (Cold Case's Kathryn Morris)?  It could be anybody.  The only way to prove your innocence is to die an ugly death.

By and large, this is a pretty good movie.  The deaths are well-executed, everyone is a valid suspect at one time or another, and the dark naval station environment helps establish a dark, menacing, and increasingly constrictive atmosphere.  And you have to like the premise - who better to orchestrate a killing spree than a trained criminal profiler who knows the tendencies, strengths, and weaknesses of his selected victims?  It's true that there are some logic problems with the truth as it is finally revealed, but that doesn't stop Mindhunters from being quite an absorbing, suspenseful thriller.",1134864000,,2916,4.842424242424243

I thought this movie was a very well done ""killer among us"" themed movie.  Everyone was a suspect and at one point or another you suspect each character of the murders.  Some parts were implausible but I have a good suspension of disbelief so I didn't mind.

Basic plot:  Student FBI Profilers are sent to an island for their last test.  One by one each of them are killed and they each suspect the others of being the killer.  As each person dies their paranoia grows and they begin to turn on each other.

Here in Russia we somehow got this movie on DVD about a year ago, I thought it had to be extremely popular abroad and was amazed it's not. Because to my opinion it's one of the best thrillers of the year. Renny Harlin who's known to be able to create visually splendid action films this time was better than usual. ""Mind Hunters"" is a model for what this kind of ""There's-a-killer-among-us"" thrillers should be - several men on isolated island, intricate and spectacular killings, sophisticated plot that grips you from the beginning and doesn't let go till the end, wonderful cast (Val Kilmer, Christian Slater, Jonny Le Miller, LL Cool J)... What else is desirable?

""Mind Hunters"" tries to lead you to the wrong directions all the time, it's extremely intense, very elaborate and dodgy. If you like this kind of puzzle-thrillers you'll enjoy this one for sure.

The traps are so complex and delicate, that if someone sneezed at the wrong time they would fail.  And yet they all work exactly as planned, at the exact time, and kill the right person.

While the movie is playing it's important not to think too much about what you're watching, because the holes are abundant and deep.

Similarly, you might start to question the amount of time that the villain needs to accomplish some of the diabolical murders that occur.

2339205,2,B0009YA3OA,"The setup and atmosphere are very good, and the cast has several very recognizable names - so why did this thriller go into straight to video hell instead of theatrical release?

Quite frankly, it's because this movie has a lot of ""B-movie"" feel to it, despite the strong cast and acting, and good editing and camera work. The plot is just too implausible in a lot of places, and the deaths of some of the characters are downright laughable.

The premise of the story is that several FBI ""profilers"" - people who try to get into the mind of a serial killer to be able to anticipate what the killer might do and where he might go in order to apprehend him are sent to a deserted island which the military uses for training purposes most of the time. They are told that a murder will be taking place, and that they must then profile the killer and anticipate his moves before he kills again.

Sounds pretty straightforward, right? Well yes, except for the Agatha Christie twist that the killer (gasp!) is ONE OF THEM! One by one, the profilers meet their doom in various ridiculous ways, all of them dying as a result of their most salient weakness or eccentricity. As the deaths pile up, they all begin to suspect one another, and the plot keeps going predictably to it's ""climax"" when the real killer is revealed and of course, defeated.

What disappointed me with this movie, however, was that it could have been a pretty good movie if only the manner in which the profilers getting knocked off was believeable. I mean, a scenario in which one person gets separated from the group for whatever reason and then is later found with throat slashed would serve to increase tension and suspense. Unfortunately, the filmmakers opted for over-the-top computer generated ridiculousness. The deaths are like something you'd see in a video game or, well, a really bad B movie. One example - a man gets instantly freeze-dried by a cylinder of helium whose cover is removed and vents the freezing gas onto his legs. His legs freeze solid in a matter of seconds, as he struggles to move, his legs, now so brittle from having freeze-dried, SNAP OFF completely! He falls to the ground, and shatters into several pieces, like a large piece of pottery! WOW! If I were thirteen years old, I might've found it the coolest thing ever.

*As a note, the movie was made in 2003 with a release date for 2004 but had been shifted to 2005 because of distribution hell (the production company went bust and so the film stayed in a vault and changed many hands). It ran early in 2005 as a DVD Region 2 Disc in Europe after several test screenings to make sure the film was still viable.",1129334400,7,2579,4.418067226890757
2339207,5,B0009YA3OA,"MINDHUNTERS helmed by action director Renny Harlin is a surprisingly chilling and effective TEN LITTLE INDIANS-style whodunit set on a deserted island in North Carolina, although actually filmed in Finland.  A group of FBI profilers are left on this island to do a training exercise involving a staged serial killer named the Puppeteer.  It isn't long though before the profilers are being mysteriously killed off by someone on the island.  Is it one of them?  Some ingenious methods of murder are used and the audience is never really sure who might be doing it.  Atmospheric and creepy with a strong cast including LL Cool J as a suspicious detective; Jonny Lee Miller as the heroic Lucas; Kathryn Morris as Sara; Patricia Valesquez as the Latin profiler; and good cameos from Christian Slater and Val Kilmer.  The movie got delayed in the Miramax/Disney divorce proceedings, and it's a shame, because it's quite a clever entry in the mystery/serial killer genre.",1129248000,16,965,5.037735849056604

2339209,4,B0009YA3OA,"Not sure how this film did at the box office during Theatrical Release - probably well, as it delivers a lot of grisly violence, loud music, brink of death moments, and pounding suspense.  Reduced to the TV screen size on DVD, MINDHUNTERS becomes a psychological thriller with a strong cast but with a screenplay/plot that in attempting to be an intellectual maze has problems with credible continuity.

The premise of the story is strong: every human wants to believe

he/she is intelligent and governed by free will when in fact we act according to ingrained and predictable personality traits.

Resident instructor Jake Harris (Val Kilmer in one of his briefest roles in film) takes a group of FBI Profiler trainees to a remote island for their ultimate test, gives the some parameters as to how to profile a serial killer, then leaves them to their own devices.  Each of the characters has an Achilles' heel and one by one each of the profilers is killed according to an enigmatic plan based on timed intervals.  It is up to the group to work against time to discover the identity of the mastermind killer.  Each of the deaths of these astute profilers grows more ghastly until the final confrontation of the remaining ones who escape the serial killer's plan.

Among the group of neo-profilers are such fine actors as Christian Slater, LL Cool J (who makes a truly impressive screen presence), Jonny Lee Miller, Clifton Collins, Jr (craftily confined to a wheelchair), Eion Bailey, Will Kemp, Kathryn Morris, and Patricia Velasquez.  They make the most of the scripted outlines of characters and before each one falls prey like a domino trick to the schemer, we understand their Achilles' heels - and that is praiseworthy in this screenplay.

Cameron Crowe recently wrote about movie music, whether it adds or detracts from the film. This score by Tuomas Kantelinen falls solidly into the latter category: the music together with the sound effects of the ongoing murders drowns dialogue and patience!  But if thrillers frosted with gore is your bag, this film is sure to please.  Grady Harp, October 05",1128384000,,2107,4.904225352112676
2339210,2,B0009YA3OA,"How Did Val Kilmer and Christian Slater get sucked into this messy film? Man, Slater needs a better agent - this is the second crappy film that he has walked through (and why the star billing? C. Slater fans - don't bother, he is in this film for less than 35 minutes).

This film, about a serial killer hunting FBI agents who hunt serial killers, is pretty weak. I could not get my mind around the main premise of the film: that one of the FBI agents is ""the killer"", a person this psychotic wouldn't be able to sit still long enough to take the Feds' screening tests, let alone pass them.

And then there's all the kooky methods that he uses to kill people are just plain ridiculous. Then there's the dialog: characters say nonsense just to be confusing.

Don't pay too much for this movie..",1127865600,4,793,4.380952380952381
2339211,2,B0009YA3OA,"A FBI head honcho sends his team of FBI agents to a remote island to be part of a training program that will get them to know how to think and act and figure out psycho serial killers. So, Kilmer leaves his members, so we think and soon after they find traps and start to get  killed off one by one from booby traps and trip wires. Directed by Renny Harlin (Deep Blue Sea, Die Hard 2), Mind Hunters is another whoduint story where you gotta find out who the killer is, think back from what they all said to each other, piece the puzzle together...though I already knew who the killer was, it was so obvious, I guessed it when he led them to the dock andtripped the bomb to explode. The cast include Kathryn Morris (Tv's Cold Case) who only does a OK job here, LL Cool J (Kingdom Come, SWAT) in another Renny Harlin movie in which in the end he lives, Clifton Collins, Jr. (Tigerland, 187) who was in a wheelchair, Patricia Vasquelez (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns) who cant act worth squat, the great Eion Bailey (Better Off Place, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer (Season 1)) did a good job until his timely death in the movie and Will Kemp (Van Helsing). Now, going on to the 2 big names in the movie, that's right I'm talking about Val Kilmer (Spartan, Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) and Christian Slater (Heathers, True Romance). Slater is only in here to show is naked arse and to die, that's it and Kilmer, well as good as Kilmer was he wasn't worthy. The only good actor in this was Jonny Lee Miller making his character look innocent but under that innocent exterior lies the real killer, plucking everyone off one by one. Some of the killings were laughable, I thought when Slater got bumped off it was kinda of a chuckle and the part where Vasquelez smokes the acid laced cigarettes was another hoot as well. The energy drains real quick here which leaves no fun.",1127779200,2,1860,4.375722543352601
2339212,5,B0009YA3OA,"This was an amazing movie, I have to be honest when I saw this DVD on the shelf, I wasn't to sure about it, the cover caught my attention, and so did the title so I picked it up, took a look at the cover a little better saw one of my favorite rappers and actor was in it, said hmm, and took a look at the preview in the back, after reading the preview I was left still a little unsure, but interested still cause LL Cool J was in it, I thought about it for a bit cause I was a little disappointed somewhat in some of LL's earlier movies, i.e. Deep Blue Sea, Caught Up, and H20, but I said what the hell I'll try it... After watching the movie I'm glad I picked it up, it's for sure going in my slowly growing DVD archive for good... If you like LL Cool J like I do, you will for sure love his acting in this one... If you like really good who done it's, cop movies, movies that keep you guessing, and scratching your heads, or movies leaving you saying I never would of thought, or I never knew, or saw that coming, or even really decent action movies, or thrillers, this is a movie for you...

The storyline had a lot of potential if it was left in the right hands and now I know why the studio was very very hesitant to release it, this piece of crap was made in 2002 but released in theaters in late 2004 or maybe it was very early 2005.  Avoid this film at all costs, unless you like to sit there and actully have your mind turn into mush.

2339228,3,B0009YA3OA,"This DVD is typical of the better of many new releases  this year but at least it is in the better bracket. On first viewing the casual film buff will enjoy the twists and turns of the plot even though there is a little too much in the gore department for younger family members.

The plot is fairly straightforward in the sense of a group of highly trained and highly suspicious characters trying to determine which of them primarily is the killer.

Your attention is held by the suspense of the next event and trying to formulate yourself who the killer might be. If you pay close attention the clue is a giveaway but then it can easily be overlooked.

Kilmer reprises a similar role to that which he played in Spartan and it is nice to see that Christian Slater can still get some work but as for the rest they are relative unknowns in the main and produce journeyman efforts which I feel will benefit them in time.

The twists and turns are replete with dead ends and red herrings but one could scarcely say that this was a whodunit of some subtlety and sophistication.

It is certainly a better effort and one which repays the 90 minute investment with some interest. Afficionados of the genre will appreciate this contribution a little more than usual given the current nadir which Hollywood appears to be going through. It is certainly one of the better ones to watch next week but there again, that is not saying much. Much of the appeal of the movie lies in turning the viewer into effect a Profiler whilst proceeding through the movie. One could even make it a competition if watching this in company.",1126828800,2,1611,4.518900343642612
2339229,3,B0009YA3OA,"Serial killers have a dark mysterious charisma that originates in their motivation to commit grotesque acts of bizarre violence.  The fascination often traces back to a serial killer's past, as the impulse that compels a person to harm another rests within their experiences.  On occasions, unexplainable circumstances bring about the murderous monsters such as Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, and David Berkowitz.  The one thing that brings these deviants together is the urge to commit vile deeds.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has an assigned task force that deals with deviant murderers that cannot stop this urge.  Some of these individuals are highly trained in psychological pathology, as they seek a pattern in the killer's prowling for victims to satisfy their repulsive desires.  They go under the name - profilers.  Mindhunters focuses its attention on small group of soon-to-be graduated profilers who are preparing for their final.

A woman's frantic scream fades away by the surrounding water, as she struggles to stay above the surface.  However, something seems to keep her below, as the opening title of Mindhunters emerges on the screen.  This ominous opening helps augment the tense atmosphere of the beginning, as two FBI agents reconnaissance the location of a possible serial killer.  Slowly fluttering snow drifts across the front window of the Volvo station wagon, as they discover a remote house.  Special Agents Reston (Christian Slater) and Sara Moore (Kathryn Morris) begin to investigate the house, as they soon discover that the possible suspect is still within the premises when a shrieking scream echoes through the night.  This is a clever build up by director Renny Harlin, which feeds to the suspenseful anticipation of the audience.  Unfortunately, Harlin pulls the rug away underneath the audience when the following scene illustrates something completely different, which induces a sense of serious cinematic swindling.

Mindhunters tells the story of a group of promising profilers who are about to embark on their final test on the remote island of Oneiga.  The special department of the FBI that educates the profilers is overseen by Jake Harris (Val Kilmer) who cleverly designs grotesque exercises in which the student can experience life-like experiences.  The island of Oneiga is owned by the United States Navy and is used for urban warfare practice by the Navy Seals.  In solitude, the FBI aspiring profilers begin to anticipate the first staged case that requires their attention.  When the first clue materializes in the shape of a broken watch that shows the time ten o'clock they all begin to ponder its significance.  What they do not know is that one of them is the target for the first murder that will take place at 10:00AM.  The question is who is going to be the next when the second watch emerges.

Renny Harlin captures an intriguing atmosphere in Mindhunters through the gruesome murders, the isolated location, the mystery and clues left behind.  The camera work helps in developing the tense mood in the film, which at times feels a little overwhelming in a good suspenseful way.  Yet, there are cinematic moments in the film where some awkwardness emerges in the form of visual trickery played on the audience.  It would have been more appropriate to develop a sense of straightforwardness with the audience, as some of the story would have felt more credible.  When the director tarnishes some of the credible aspects of the film it leaves the viewer with a sticky impression of some situations.  This harms the overall value of the cinematic experience, even though Mindhunters has some good moments and leaves the viewers with a decent visual feast in the sign of callous killers.",1126224000,3,3748,5.141914191419142

You may not like the plot twists, you may not like the killer, you may dislike the fact two of the main stars are barely in the film, but I dug every second of it.
  My only dislike was the strong ""The Thing"" trust or fear complex everyone had. It was played out a little sloppy with people accusing others at a pin drop, and being buddies one second and ready to kill them the next. Could've played a bit better, but it still left me well satisfied!
