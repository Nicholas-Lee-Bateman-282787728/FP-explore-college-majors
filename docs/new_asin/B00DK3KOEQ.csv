8594067,5,B00DK3KOEQ,Best anime yet!!! But cost way to much..,1424736000,,40,4.125
8594068,3,B00DK3KOEQ,"I love the anime but the price is a rip off. This show isn't even 2 seasons! They just split the 25 episode solo season in half to take more money. $200 for an awesome show just isn't worth it, that was a disgusting marketing ploy on the company's part.",1414108800,7,253,4.08
8594069,1,B00DK3KOEQ,"I really want to get this anime! But for some ungodly reason it cost waaaay to much! Everywhere I look, it just insanely price to high. I'm not sure it the company doing or just people want to up the price. But I can get a COMPLETE SERIES from Funimation or Save for like $20 - $65. And sometimes I can get a dvd and blu-ray combo for $60 also from Funimation. So I guess I just going have to wait to add this amazing anime to my collection. When it is at a more reasonable price.

8594070,5,B00DK3KOEQ,I think everyone should see this season . Wheither its cheap or not the overall experience will leave you wanting more in this action genre. As a collector and lover of anime hands down it was the best second season of a series I've ever seen before. Truly exciting and memorable. It seriously rocked my wild spirit.,1391299200,3,316,4.56140350877193
8594071,5,B00DK3KOEQ,"I really love this show. Its my favorite anime of all time.

My only complaint is the price. Even though this anime is VERY good, I don`t think I would pay $200 if I haven`t seen the series yet. For some customers who buy anime DVDs not knowing what to expect, I don`t think they would buy this just because. if it was cheaper, Maybe $50-60 per DVD, I could understand.

And in the description, it`s not really clear if the DVDs are in English dub, or in subbed.

It says ""Subtitles: English"", But it also says ""Finally dubbed in English"".

The show is fantastic in subbed and dubbed, but I just want it to be clear which it is.

But this show is amazing, I highly recommend it.",1387152000,14,678,4.224806201550388
