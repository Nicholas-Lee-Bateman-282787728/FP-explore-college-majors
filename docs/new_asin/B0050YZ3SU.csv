8452044,5,B0050YZ3SU,"A brilliant overview of Colombian cooking.  Mr. McDonald is to be commended for the clarity of his explanations and for his ability to adhere to tradition.  His recipes are obviously authentic and his enthusiasm is contagious.  I love the introduction, in which he visits a Colombian market and identifies many of the products offered by the vendors.  (Comete algunos errores, pero se entiende todo lo que dice.)  I highly recommend this DVD!",1427414400,,442,5.083333333333333
