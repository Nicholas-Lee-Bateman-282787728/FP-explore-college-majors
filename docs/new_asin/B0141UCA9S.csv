8729351,5,B0141UCA9S,"Through reading Lauren Fay's biography of Shostakovich, which among other things is interesting on the subject of Soviet musical culture,  I came across the name of ""Vainberg."" I had never heard of this composer, and found out that it is now spelled ""Weinberg."" It turns out that there has been a wave of interest in his work since his death in 1996. I have now bought five of his symphonies (three of which have vocal elements, following the examples of Mahler and Shostakovich, two of his idols--he was personally very close to the latter.) I also bought all 17 of his string quartets in a box from the Belgian Danel QuartetI've just begun exploring those. But the revelation so far, and a real stunner it is, is his opera ""The Passenger,"" premiered in Bregenz in 2010 (composed in the mid-1960s). I's an Auschwitz opera--seemingly an impossible task, but Weinberg brought it off brilliantly to devastating effect, and this production from Bregenz is also brilliant in every respect. Of 20th century operas that I have seen or heard only Wozzeck matches it for sheer emotional power.",1525305600,,1085,4.864864864864865
8729352,5,B0141UCA9S,"I was mostly curious what could it be an opera about the Holocaust.
It appeared to be a masterpiece: great music, great musical dramaturgy, well-told story. The music is complex: some parts reminding about Richard Straus, Russian music, and folklore, Jewish melodies, citations from Bach. That is not eclectic, it is deeply connected with the characters.
It is a pity that a composer that is at least equal to Shostakovich was completely forgotten. The Bregenz Festival is doing a great job restoring the legacy of this composer with several operas and more than 20 symphonies.
The thing that is strange is that the Jews are missing from this libretto about Auschwitz. The explanation is that Weinberg, born in Poland, survival of the Holocaust was living and creating music in the Soviet Union. He was persecuted and kept in lower profile by the communists who were anti-Semites as well. He dreamed seeing his opera on stage, that has never happened in his life. So with the librettist, they have made most of the prisoners Russian and Polish. There is one Jew from Thessaloniki. Having in mind the time when the opera was created I understand this mimicry. I am curious what are the names of characters in the novel on which the opera was based. Maybe it would make sense to restore the names of the characters as they were in the novel. It will not be the first time to be done in the opera. Verdi had similar problems with the Austrian censorship.",1471219200,4,1451,4.739130434782608
8729353,5,B0141UCA9S,"I had the amazing and wonderful opportunity of seeing ""The Passenger"" performed in Detroit at the Michigan Opera Theater. From the moment the opera opens and then at the point that the stage setting - also a ""character"" in the opera - opens into the Auschwitz prison site you sit mesmerized, and you watch throughout the whole opera moved, overwhelmed, and silent.  The performance on this DVD does an excellent job of bringing that opera ""home"" so that others can see it, since it has been performed rarely, and probably (unfortunately) will be performed rarely (since it deals with such a terrible part of world history).  The recording of this excllent performance is made more meaningful by well-written subtitles (for those who want them) to go with the several languages that are used in the opera.  In addition, there is an excellent half-hour documentary about the composer, worth watching afterwards.  It is unfortunate that the opera has been performed so little, but it is certainly  a difficult opera to watch, and an expensive and difficult one to produce. I find it especially sad that Mieczslaw Weinberg never heard this produced, and am glad that Zofia Posmycz, the author of the original story (and a participant in the original experience described in it) has been able to participate in the development of the production you see on this DVD as well as the ones now taking place in the United States and elsewhere.  I would recommend seeing this with a group of friends or colleagues so that you can discuss it afterwards.  But for those who just want to enjoy a powerful performance of an amazing opera, this opera is worth purchasing and watching on their own.",1464566400,5,1680,4.853146853146853

8729355,5,B0141UCA9S,"Well, this is what I expect opera to be in the XXI C: not entertainment for the 1% and their minions, but an unflinching analysis of  the horrors of contemporary history.  I am also referring to the likes of ""Nicole"", ""The Death of Klingshoffer"", ""Claude"", ""The perfect American"" and ""From the House of the Dead"".  Alas, but these are painful visions of the human condition as it has or not developed, not mindless chirping canary divas and divos (try Rameau, Donizetti et. al).  And it cannot be ""Eurotrashed""--the events are still shaping our common future.

As to the production itself: exemplary in its split stage, reflecting what festers beneath the surface; Michelle Breedt and Elena Kelessidi providing some of the most moving singing and superb acting I have seen in a long time; an ensemble where each one is given an opportunity to sing his/her own individual sorrow.  But more of all, the very clear political message both of eternal remembrance and perpetual unforgiveness, which which I entirely agree--and a sad reminder that the victims have, at this point, become the victimizers.",1458691200,7,1097,5.0
8729356,5,B0141UCA9S,"The 2010 Bregenz Festival presented the first staged performances of a lost opera completed over 40 years earlier but suppressed in the Soviet era. THE PASSENGER's premiere came too late for either composer Mieczyslaw Weinberg or librettist Alexander Medvedev to share in what was, by all accounts, a triumph. The Polish concentration camp survivor Zofia Posmysz, whose original story has been adapted for several media, *was* still alive, in her eighties, and was able to be present. She was also a consultant in the production; and one sees and hears from her in the half-hour bonus feature on this DVD.

The story takes place in 1959. Liese, a 37-year-old German woman, has never told her older husband, a West German diplomat named Walter, of her past as an SS camp overseer 15 years earlier. Walter's own activities during the war are never clarified. Liese and Walter are traveling by ocean liner to their new home in Brazil when Liese is disconcerted by a female passenger's resemblance to an inmate of Auschwitz, a Polish Catholic named Marta. Liese is torn between certainty that Marta could not possibly have survived her sentencing to the execution block (the ""Black Wall"") and anxiety that the strange woman on the ship somehow may be Marta, and that Marta recognizes and will expose her. Liese confesses all to Walter, and in flashbacks we learn of the overseer's complicated feelings toward this particular prisoner. We also meet Marta's fianc, the principled violinist Tadeusz, and several of Marta's fellow female prisoners.

Weinberg's music is responsive to situation. Much of it is harsh and biting, but there are also passages of delicacy and great beauty, such as a Russian inmate's unaccompanied folk song. The Bregenz Festival fielded a strong cast for the premiere, and mezzo-soprano Lisa Breedt convinces that the central role of Liese is a great opportunity for a singing actress of her vocal type (Ms. Breedt's other roles include Wagner's Venus and Brangne, which she has sung at Bayreuth). The soprano role of Liese's foil, Marta, may be a similar plum, but Elena Kelessidi (a former Royal Opera House regular in such roles as Violetta and Marguerite) finds less specificity in it, and is in rough voice. Tenor Roberto Sacc does admirable work in the thankless role of Walter, the smug diplomat who acts as his younger wife's inquisitor. Artur Rucinski, a Polish baritone whose profile is on the rise (he has since performed Conte di Luna at Salzburg and has shared an ROH run of EUGENE ONEGIN with Dmitri Hvorostovsky), sings Tadeusz's music with a warm and lovely timbre and gives a dignified dramatic performance. Svetlana Doneva, as the Russian prisoner Katja, seizes the opportunity of the opera's most beautiful vocal music, the a capella folk song.

The opera receives a festival-quality framing in the stage production by David Pountney (two-tiered set design by Johann Engels, the bright ""present"" taking place above and the dim and smoky ""past"" below) and the assertive conducting of the Vienna Symphony Orchestra by Teodor Currentzis. Although the original libretto was entirely in Russian, Pountney's production features no fewer than seven sung languages, reflecting the multinational cast of characters.

Theatrically gripping and musically accessible (at least, for a listener who tolerates the operas of Shostakovich, a friend, admirer, and key influence of Weinberg's), THE PASSENGER has made its way around Europe and the United States as the decade has gone on. The Pountney production continues to tour to this day, and alternative views have begun to appear, including a new production at Frankfurt Opera. Opera audiences are not always receptive to the unfamiliar, to put it mildly, but this piece shows promising signs of making a place for itself among 20th-century repertory. It examines a dark period of recent history but at the same time provides compelling human drama. The DVD of the Bregenz Festival production represents and introduces it admirably.",1452902400,6,4010,5.164615384615384
