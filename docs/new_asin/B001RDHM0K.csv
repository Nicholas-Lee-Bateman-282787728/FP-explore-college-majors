8337743,5,B001RDHM0K,"Wolfe's photography is art.  If you like to ""armchair"" travel, you will love those videos.  He has a laid back demeanor but you can tell he is passionate about what he does.  You have to admire someone who can find beauty in leaf spores.  Wolfe makes you feel as if you are there with him or that you would like to go there one day.  His interaction with his subjects are the same regardless of whether it is a human or an animal.  He is respective and his awe is contagious.  I own all of the videos and am still waiting for the next season.",1428192000,,542,4.104761904761904
