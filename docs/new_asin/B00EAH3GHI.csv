5899406,5,B00EAH3GHI,"I'm 30 now so was 13 when this aired, and with Kurt Cobain's very untimely and unfortunate death I was never actually able to see them live in concert outside of on TV, and now through DVD releases. Grew up as a huge fan of Nirvana and still am, GOD was I hoping for Nirvana to be the band to finally get people to consider a band besides The Beatles as the greatest band, most influential, most innovative, or most anything (I do think Radiohead has at least finally given our generation a band to make an argument for). So, yeah I have high expectations for any Nirvana release.

When seeing this my first thought was that it would make up for the blu ray compatibility problems which surround 'Nirvana: Live at the Paramount', I personally own the DVD of 'Nirvana: Live at the Paramount' because I just didn't want to chance buying the blu ray and than being having it be incompatible with my blu ray player. So, to an extent, am a bit disappointed, that their will be no blu ray release of 'Live and Loud' (at least no announcement yet). However, after reading from another reviewer that 'Live and Loud' was taped in standard definition really isn't possible as it wouldn't ever be able to meet true HD quality standards. So, actually, it's also kind of a relief that production company for 'Live and Loud' isn't just releasing a concert ""HD"" Blu Ray even though the concert audio and video quality don't meet, or preferably, exceed HD standards. Especially since SO SO SO SO many bands do this, LOL, do an Amazon search for Blu Rays for bands from the 1960s and 1970s tons of them that are notorious for poor quality ""HD"" Blu Ray concert releases.

Okay, now my second hope or thought:
I have a bit ""odd"" favorites regarding Nirvana, my favorite Nirvana ""album"" is without a doubt 'Incesticide' (used album because, yeah it's not a studio album). Actually only met one other Nirvana fan whose favorite is 'Incesticide'. So, was scrolling down as soon as the page loaded hoping to see tracks like ""Turnaround"", ""Molly's Lips"", ""Son of a Gun"", and especially my all time favorite Nirvana song ""(New Wave) Polly)"". Well, obviously this isn't the case with the track list for this DVD. Still though, gotta love that it's not like so many other bands whose DVD release track listings all look exactly the same, so gotta say definitely more than happy with it.

Regardless of these two above things, I am grabbing this, already per-ordered, and cannot wait to get it.",1377302400,3,2466,4.612756264236902
5899407,5,B00EAH3GHI,"to be honest - this is like a dream coming true. Christmas in September.
two decades of waiting, long 20 years(!)
and now for real: the legendary Seattle concert first time ever in a moderate quality and the entire set

in fact this is the best recorded concert by Nirvana serving an unleashed rawness of sound combined with a good humored Cobain and the best location you may find.
(and thatswhy noone will miss ""Teen Spirit"" in the set, because this has been Cobain's way not do spoil the mainstream commerce and putting the focus on the sound he was always searching for)

without a doubt: the climax of the Nirvana era

so thanks MTV and Mrs Love for keeping it under surface for such a long time - ""...the money will roll right in""",1376870400,29,736,4.437037037037037
5899408,5,B00EAH3GHI,"I regretted never recording this when it originally aired on MTV but, now it is available to own.  No longer must we watch poor VHS recordings on YouTube.  Regrettably, this concert was videotaped in standard definition, not filmed, so that means the quality will never be HD and a Bluray release will never be possible.  It is also fullscreen like the Live At Reading DVD.  It's no question that this DVD exceeds expectations.  The bonus footage is what I've been wanting all these years.",1376697600,38,489,4.773809523809524
5899409,5,B00EAH3GHI,"FINALLY! I am so glad this concert is getting released on dvd after 20 years. I've had the tv edit for years, now I can do away with it. This is a MUST own, placed my order today :)",1375660800,5,181,3.6666666666666665

5899418,5,B00EAH3GHI,"Before buying this DVD i had a low gen version of this recorded off TV and put on DVD and it looked alright and sounded okay. This is a major upgrade to the bootleg versions of this show. The picture and sound quality are near HD on this one. The sound has been remastered while i thought the original sounded just fine but the remaster is welcome on this edition. We get some extras on this DVD which are as follows; Rehersal footage of MTV live and Loud some songs preformed in Munich, Germany and Heart Shaped Box video directors cut and original cut.  The performance the band put on in the main feature of this DVD is amazing. New fans of Nirvana will surely enjoy this concert. I had been watiing for this DVD to come out for the past twelve years. Now we need to see an official release of Nirvana live in Rio 1993 and a CD of live at Roseland Ballroom 1993.",1411862400,9,865,4.210843373493976
5899419,5,B00EAH3GHI,"If you are a Nirvana fan, you HAVE to buy this. Includes the full concert that was aired on MTV back in '93 for New Years. I taped that concert and still have it on VHS today, but his DVD is even better and includes the full track list! Plus some extra concert footage from right near the end of Kurt's life. Really sad, but amazing to see footage of Kurt again and the raw, gritty, powerful emotions of Kurt, Dave, and Kris rocking Nirvana's greatest songs. There isn't much to say other then you must buy this, and it's incredible to watch again after all these years.",1403654400,2,570,4.287037037037037
5899420,5,B00EAH3GHI,I've been a nirvana freak since never mind came out and had to buy this. I can only give 5 stars. Wish I could give more. The video the sound and the songs are great. You can't go wrong with this DVD. Buy it today !,1401148800,2,215,3.6956521739130435

5899423,2,B00EAH3GHI,"I watched this concert when it originally aired and I remember liking it a lot. Being a bit older now and having a bit more knowledge as to what Kurt was going thru due to his suicide a few months later, I have to say this is my least favorite concert footage from nirvana. Kurt looks so bored and I think he is just going thru the motions, switching to a cheap guitar before the planned instrument smash, and to the slightly condescending and sarcastic applause he gives the audience at the end, as if to say ""you'd applaud at anything""  He's, to me anyways, obviously bored to death thru this concert and it makes it a non watch for me.",1396310400,5,638,4.2727272727272725
5899424,5,B00EAH3GHI,"Though I didn't have the opportunity to attend a Nirvana concert when Kurt Cobain was alive, this dvd brought the concert experience into my living room.  What an awesome dvd!!",1395705600,2,176,4.866666666666666
5899425,5,B00EAH3GHI,Nirvana Live and Loud my favorite band and this is a favorite concert expected to have good and really loved it,1391126400,2,111,4.333333333333333
5899426,5,B00EAH3GHI,"As expected, this DVD covers everything you would dream to see in a Nirvana show, specially this one, because of the setlist, the band's energy, the filming, and the sound. I remember wondering why releasing this whole concert never crossed somebody's mind but...good things come to those who wait !

I guess there are many more Nirvana gigs out there to be released with this quality and relevance to us.",1389312000,5,405,4.785714285714286
5899427,5,B00EAH3GHI,Great DVD for anyone that loves this band! It's cool if you like nirvana but it also makes a really good gift.,1388361600,5,110,4.045454545454546

5899431,4,B00EAH3GHI,"Really good sound quality, solid performance, and a great set.  I'm not a huge fan of their pre-In Utero sets, so this is a great show for me.",1386115200,2,142,4.071428571428571
5899432,5,B00EAH3GHI,"kurt and company in top form. from the opening song to the closing song this concert is pure energy. the band is so tight. i'm 52 years young and alot of my friends don't like nirvana. that's there problem. this is a long dvd also. you really get your moneys worth. if you like nirvana,this is a goody. enjoy/peace",1385769600,9,314,4.338983050847458
5899433,5,B00EAH3GHI,One of the greatest Nirvana Perfomances.  At the height of their popularity and Kurt coming to grips with something that ended up far bigger than he expected.  Kurt put on the best show of all time for MTV.  Worth your money!,1383609600,,225,4.439024390243903

5899436,5,B00EAH3GHI,"Great concert. Great DVD, glad to have the extras as well. For me, the extras sold did it for me. I've noticed a few different camera shots throughout the concert (since I have the old VHS quality bootleg of it). 20 years, well worth it.",1382572800,10,237,4.288888888888889
5899437,5,B00EAH3GHI,I used to have a taped from broadcast VHS of this performance and always wanted it to be released on DVD. The performance is excellent and makes me miss Nirvana. The only thing that's missing is Anthony and Flea in drag introducing the songs.,1382572800,,242,4.5227272727272725
5899438,5,B00EAH3GHI,"Best video of the band; especially because Kurt looked he was having fun! Makes you realize what trash his wife Courtney Love when you find out she gets the money that should going to their daughter, Francis Bean.",1382313600,4,213,4.631578947368421
5899439,5,B00EAH3GHI,"I love Nirvana and since Kurt's death in 94 I have not seen anything so powerful and moving. Live and Loud is a great purchase, and one I will watch time and time again. Dam I miss Cobain.",1382140800,2,188,3.973684210526316
5899440,5,B00EAH3GHI,"I remember recording this off of MTV when it first aired and had Breeders and Cypress Hill also. Finally a more complete show of Nirvana's LIVE & LOUD. Not sure if they even did more but this is the Holy Grail for sure.

There have been other live performances released but to me this is the most rocked out Nirvana show that is officially released.

The sound is mind blowing awesome. I remember on my original VHS recording off of MTV the stereo was more dominant on one channel but this is absolute perfection.

I guess the only wish if it were film and in 16:9 with Bluray. But it was for TV and in '93 so absolutely no complaints.

Why it took 20 years, no idea but FINALLY!! :D",1381536000,,683,4.230769230769231
5899441,5,B00EAH3GHI,"sHORT AND SWEET, I LOVE THIS NIRVANA WITH PAT SMEAR, THE CONCERT (NOW IS FULL WITH 8 PLUS SONGS THAN WHAT MTV AIRED) IS GREAT AND THE FINAL 10 SECONDS BEFORE COBAIN LEAVES THE STAGE TO ME RESUMES WHAT KURT WAS FEELING MONTHS BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT....THE SPECIAL FEATURES ARE GREAT TOO.",1381276800,,284,4.480769230769231
5899442,4,B00EAH3GHI,"I only give this 4 stars because I went through the songs on the list of this page and I see that several of the songs are repeated alternate versions of the same songs and this is a big distractor and detractor for me when I go to buy music, I don't understand why you need several different versions of the same songs.",1380931200,,320,4.095238095238095
5899443,5,B00EAH3GHI,"5 Stars for the performance. The picture quality is not the best, but it was never meant to be high definition widescreen, etc. They don't make bands like this anymore. That being said Kings Of Leon are the closest I've seen. I'm not comparing their music, but the mentality. Kings Of Leon would have fit in perfectly with the 90's bands. Again, not the music. But, in terms of not selling out and being genuine. They also both had drug problems. They clearly didn't make music soley for fame, money, and girls.",1380499200,,511,4.565217391304348
5899444,5,B00EAH3GHI,"Finally in its entirety, the amazing Live and Loud set for MTV officially released.  The added rehearsal footage plus the television performances are a sweet bonus, but the show itself is the juice:  show opener 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' whacks out of the screen and speakers forcefully, and the set list mixes all the eras.  Great renditions of 'Drain You', 'All Apologies', 'Come As You Are', Bowie's 'The Man Who Sold The World', 'Rape Me', 'Heart Shaped Box' and 'School'.  This DVD is a must have for fans of Nirvana.",1380240000,14,526,4.811111111111111
5899445,5,B00EAH3GHI,"Nirvana's final tour concert, filmed on December 13th, 1993, is finally available in it's entirety for the first time on DVD. Of all of Nirvana's shows, not counting the untouchable Unplugged performance, this would have to be my favorite. The band blazes no-holds-bar from the start and doesn't let up. Kurt was at his peak creatively and the band had never sounded more full, partly because of the addition of ex-Germ's guitarist Pat Smear. The songs from their latest outing In Utero sound especially good live. Though this concert is now considered a classic, it is also a somber one watching now knowing what would transpire in the coming months. What makes this already perfect DVD even better is the extras. Rehearsals before the show, some live TV spots and footage from the bands final show in Munich, Germany. Also included is the original and director's cut of the Heart Shaped Box video. So if you're a fan of Nirvana, or just grew up during this short-lived era of musical genius, this purchase should be a no brainer.",1380153600,14,1031,4.797752808988764

5899447,5,B00EAH3GHI,so happy they finally released this INCREDIBLE AMAZING PERFECTION the best nirvana concert ever i been having this for about 10 years now its about time we got the real thing on high def,1379980800,2,186,4.5
5899448,5,B00EAH3GHI,"Just got this ""Live and Loud"" DVD in the mail and it's awesome. I must say that only saw it once when it originally aired and have seen a few random clips on Youtube...but those clips don't compare. The picture and sound quality on this DVD is top notch and a must have for any Nirvana fan. Great buy and I received it super fast because I pre-ordered it.",1379894400,4,355,4.159420289855072
5899449,5,B00EAH3GHI,"They must have been so sick of Teen Spirit, to not play it at a concert..Btw folks the 20 year old to 40 year old thing doesn't apply to Nirvana..Kurt was born in 67, so he'd be 45 this year..so try like 15-55 year olds..",1377993600,6,221,3.933333333333333
8603168,5,B00EAH3GHI,"It was 1993 and Nirvana was at their peak with their latest album In Utero for which they crisscrossed North America then Europe the following year before the demise of their frontman Kurt Cobain. This concert taken from Seattle's Pier 48 and was originally broadcast on MTV. Now we get to see the concert in its entirety plus 4 songs from the concert's rehearsals, the original and director's cut of the ""Heart-Shaped Box"" music video[which won Nirvana an award for Best Music Video], three appearances from Nulle Part Ailleurs-Paris, France, an appearance on Tunnel-Rome, Italy and, finally, three songs from Nirvana's final show in Munich, Germany.
The main show here kicks off with ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter"" as Kurt Cobain sustains his guitar then kicks into high gear. Bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl provide a great rhythm section throughout this show. The group's line-up is augmented by ex-Germs guitarist Pat Smear and Cellist Lori Goldston. Background vocals are mainly done by Grohl and sometimes Smear[on ""Rape Me""; ""Serve The Servants"" and ""Heart-Shaped Box"" in particular]. There are eight songs on here that weren't in the original broadcast-""Sliver""; ""All Apologies""; ""Blew""; ""The Man Who Sold The World""; ""School"": ""Come as You Are""; ""About A Girl"" and the climatic ""Endless, Nameless"". It's funny how Kurt spits into one of the cameras during that final number which was the only extract of the original broadcast not to mention the destruction of Kurt's black Strat which was also used on ""Blew"" otherwise his main guitar was his ""Jag-stang"". There are 7 songs from In Utero performed here, 5 from Nevermind{Sorry, no ""Teen Spirit"" here], 3 from Bleach and the leftovers ""Sliver"" and ""The Man Who Sold The World""[Lori Goldston plays cello on the latter one as well as ""All Apologies""].
As for the extras we start with the four Live And Loud rehearsals-""Very Ape"", the one song from In Utero that wasn't in the actual concert in which Kurt plays a bit of drums beforehand; ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter"", which Kurt almost plays ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" beforehand; ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""Rape Me"" on which Kurt's P.A. is shallow. Next is two video versions of ""Heart-Shaped Box"" before we travel to Paris for an appearance on Nulle Part Ailleurs for ""Rape Me""; ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""Drain You"", the last of which where Kurt throws down his guitar midway through break the group is dressed in black ties and vests. We stop over in Rome for an appearance on Tunnel where ""Serve The Servants"" is performed. Finally, the icing on the cake as we see Nirvana in their last concert from Munich with the songs ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter""; The Cars' ""My Best Friend's Girl"", featuring a quote from ""Moving In Stereo"" as well as visual effects and reactions from fans and, last but least, ""Drain You"".
Strongly recommended for any Nirvana fan alongside other shows like the Halloween show from the Paramount[1991], Live at Reading[1992] and of course, Unplugged on MTV[1993]. The title of this DVD says it all. Indeed!",1517875200,,3047,5.0
8603169,4,B00EAH3GHI,"Ok, I just felt like I had something to add that other reviewers are leaving out. Relative to 90% of other shows, this is a damn good (5 star) show. But it's well below par for Nirvana. Cobain was in an horribly sordid state when it was filmed, and he was only to get worse. This isn't anywhere near the raw intensity of Live at Paramount or Reading. Or for that matter most of the material on the With the Lights Out DVD. Cobain is clearly a husk of his former self. Now, Nirvana rocked harder than anyone else around, so a husk of Cobain is superior to most fully realized human beings. But for anyone familiar with their better shows, this is a seriously depressing sight.",1489622400,,675,4.322834645669292
