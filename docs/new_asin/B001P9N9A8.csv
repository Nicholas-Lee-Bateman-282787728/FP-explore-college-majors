3744337,1,B001P9N9A8,"This movie sucks 100%
One stupid girl removing teeth to herself and to her friend.
That's the only scary scene in the movie.
The end is one of the worst I have ever seen in the horror genre.
Do a favor to yourself and avoid this title!",1243382400,,235,4.0212765957446805
3744338,2,B001P9N9A8,"Slaughter doesn't have nearly as much gore as the title seems to imply, and instead passes itself off as a psychological thriller that simply fails to thrill.  Faith (Amy Shiels) is on the run from an abusive ex-boyfriend, and ends up meeting and striking an unlikely friendship with farmgirl Lola (Lucy Holt).  Before you know it, Faith learns of some of Lola's ugly family secrets, and just what's getting fed to the pigs.  Screaming and teeth pulling ensue.  Predictable, drawn out, and definitely not scary or suspenseful in the least, Slaughter is definitely one of the least enjoyable films in this year's After Dark Horrorfest.  Granted that isn't saying a whole lot considering the fact that this year's lineup as a whole has pretty much been the worst overall yet, but you get thee point.  All in all, you'll definitely see worse horror flicks than Slaughter (some of which can be found in this year's After Dark Horrorfest lineup), but you'll definitely find better ones too that are definitely more worth your time.",1242691200,,1026,4.901734104046243
3744339,4,B001P9N9A8,"""Slaughter,"" is a very interesting and intriguing movie. The movie is about Faith, a young woman who is trying to rebuild her life after abruptly leaving her abusive boyfriend. To elude her abuser, Faith moves out of town, changes her phone number, and distances herself from her friends. During this transition, she meets Lola, a seemingly innocent small town girl. Faith quickly befriends Lola and becomes her roommate at her family's farm. Soon, Faith meets Lola's family and becomes the central piece of a diabolical scheme.

""Slaughter,"" is one of the films featured in the Horrorfest 2009 series. This movie is very predictable but at the same time, it is very intriguing. I definitely recommend it!",1242086400,11,705,5.077586206896552
3744340,4,B001P9N9A8,"""Slaughter"" was more of a realistic kind of story than a gorefest you would expect from it's title. If you want endless gore, move on to something else. But this is an excellent film full of suspense. I felt a rollercoaster of moods. You'll want to feel sorry for your chacaters and hate them all at the same time. In the end you will say, ""Oh no!"" Not my favorite of the 8 films but up there near the top.",1240099200,4,406,4.0875
3744341,5,B001P9N9A8,I had to watch this movie twice to fully grasp its masterful plot.  Director Hopewell has created a tense psychological thriller that will appeal to those who enjoy The Blair Witch Project and Session 9.  This movie and The Broken are the two standout films from the 2009 HorrorFest.  Support Hopewell and buy this DVD.,1238889600,3,319,4.763636363636364
3744342,4,B001P9N9A8,"""Slaughter"" was by far the most realistic of all the After Dark Horror Films this year,In My opinion.
If your looking for a Texas Chainsaw Massacre or heavy gore this isn't for you. But if your looking for a film that's thought provoking, thrilling and heart wrenching it is for you.

 I won't recount the story you can read the synopsis for that what I will give you is the lowdown on what I thought of it as a slasher /horror fan. As a general rule I  LOVE gore and blood but I must admit I was pulled into this story while not seeing any of this for the first hour or so

granted I would have liked to have seen some but it wasn't needed. There were some very tense scenes towards the climax where I gritted my teeth and winced. It does have that gritty torture porn feel to it ,in the way it's filmed and presented,If your squeamish about teeth and pliers it will give you some thrills.

The whole pig farm combined with the what lies in the bottom of the lake thing is pretty chilling as well. It also has a great fight for survival sequence where the power struggle goes back and forth for awhile so you never know who is really going to win until it happens. All in all I though it was one of the best this year.",1238544000,9,1219,4.1265822784810124
3744343,4,B001P9N9A8,"This is going to sound strange, but I think the reason I liked ""Slaughter"" is because it's not an endless succession of gore. This will probably disappoint some, and I agree that the title is very misleading; it's not a sleazy exploitation film, but a slow, tense psychological drama that actually bothers to tell a story. Granted, it's not very plausible, and I have a hard time buying into the fact that it was ""inspired by true events."" But what it lacks in credibility it makes up for in both style and character development. It a deliberately paced film, director Stewart Hopewell opting to let the story unfold gradually before letting the final twenty minutes or so go at full speed. This doesn't always work, but here it allows the audience to take everything in, especially when it comes to the dialogue given to the two leads; I won't give you a list of quotes, but if you pay attention, you'll notice that what they say to each other is ultimately very telling.

The tension builds as a direct result of the opening credit sequence, which uses clever camera angles and lighting effects to reveal that an injured, bound woman is being dragged through a field. When the woman and her abductor arrive at a dock, the abductor ties a cinderblock to the woman's ankles and pushes her into a lake. If you think I just gave away a crucial plot point, think again; there's more to ""Slaughter"" than meets the eye.

That's when the story slows down and backtracks. We're introduced to Cathy (Antonia Bernath), a young woman who just left her abusive boyfriend to start a new life in Atlanta. One night, she and her friend, Faith (Amy Shiels), celebrate at a local nightclub; out of the corner of her eye, Cathy notices another young woman who looks like she's being hassled by a man. She intervenes on her behalf, and the two immediately strike up a friendship. Here enters Lola (Lucy Holt), who lives on a farm just outside the city with her father and brothers. She appears to be in a desperate situation, unfulfilled on the farm and hated by her father, especially after the untimely death of her mother some years earlier. She claims she would like nothing more than to get out of Georgia and go far, far away. She vents her frustrations by acting promiscuous, constantly throwing herself at older, rich men, manipulating them into giving her gifts like watches.

Cathy likes Lola a great deal, but it's obvious that she doesn't completely understand her odd behavior. She's friendly around Lola, but she's also careful, especially since she's in such an unfamiliar environment. Everything about the farm seems open and welcoming ... except for the slaughterhouse at the bottom of the hill, where Lola's father (David Sterne) spends a great deal of time. One of the reasons it's so frightening is because, for most of the film, it's closed off from Cathy. For a time, the loud squealing of pigs are the only indications that anything is happening.

One could make a case for the pigs relating to Cathy's ex, who has constantly been trying to call her. That might be a stretch, however, simply because the symbolism is obvious. There are so many shots of pigs in this film that they have to serve as a metaphor for something. One could make a case for the pigs relating to Cathy's ex, who has constantly been trying to call her on her cell phone. That might be a stretch, however, simply because the symbolism is obvious. It's more likely that it has something to do with the men in Lola's life, but I can't elaborate on that since too much would be given away. Let it suffice to say that Lola hasn't had the best male role models.

Eventually comes the climactic moment when Cathy finally enters the slaughterhouse and discovers a room hidden way in the back, which contains a vacant chair and a locker full of shoeboxes. To describe more would ruin both the suspense and a plot twist that seems expected but somehow manages to be surprising nonetheless. What's interesting is that, in spite of the twist functioning at a level appropriate to horror movies, it's doesn't evoke that same sense of outrageousness other such stories are known for--shocking, but not altogether over the top. We've spent a lot of time with the main characters at this point, which, for reasons I won't reveal, helps a great deal during the film's final minutes.

The ending is perhaps too downbeat, and the final shot is heart wrenching in its uncertainty. There is, however, a sickening feeling that it couldn't have turned out any other way, which, if you see this movie, you will find both frightening and sad. Despite being advertised as a dime-a-dozen horror film, ""Slaughter"" delivers on a level more compelling than what the genre promises. Under different circumstances, it probably could have been widely released as a dark crime drama. That's not very good news for the horror movie fans that were enticed by the title, and if you're one of those people, I'm sorry to tell you that ""Slaughter"" is not going to be what you expected. But if you're looking for a carefully paced thriller with strong characters, you just might get your money's worth.",1231804800,14,5140,4.7119021134593995

3744503,3,B001P9N9A8,"Faith leaves home to escape from her abusive past, but she will find much more to fear after moving in to her new friend's secluded farmhouse. Stewart Hopewell's feature-length debut, SLAUGHTER, is a slow burn that mindfully builds on its mystery and suspense. Unfortunately, we never learn enough about either of the girls to invest in their individual plights, and the motivation behind the initial murders is dubious at best. Hopewell leaves several questionable subplots underdeveloped, and fails to tie them all back together into a satisfying conclusion. The killer's final solution is so rash, violent, and extreme that it is beyond belief, especially when so many plausible alternatives were left open to them. That isn't to say that SLAUGHTER is a poorly made film, however. Lucy Holt and Amy Shiels are both very good in the respective roles, and the clean cinematography lulls us in to a false sense of security as we enter increasingly dark and dangerous territory. With a few minor adjustments, SLAUGHTER could have made for a passable entry in survivalist horror, but the twists and turns are taken much too far given the serious tone.

3744504,4,B001P9N9A8,"Slaughter was released to theaters back in 2009 as part of the After Dark Horrorfest III (aka 8 Films to Die For). As of writing this review, it is only the second After Dark movie I have viewed.

The film opens up with a twenty-something Faith (played Amy Shiels) arriving in Atlanta and leaving her small town life, her horrible mother, and her abusive ex-boyfriend. At a nightclub, she meets a twenty-something Lola (played by Lucy Holt), who is care-free type person. They chat and exchange numbers.

Just as Faith starts to adjust to the city life, she receives dozens of hateful emails from her ex-boyfriend. Not having anyone to turn to, she befriends Lola, who lives outside of Atlanta on her family farm with her father and brothers. Faith moves out of the city after she recognizes her ex's truck parked near her apartment and she ends up living with Lola in the upstairs part of the barn that has been turned into an apartment.

Lola lives a wild life; letting rich older men buy her stuff in exchange for a one night stand. The men are always gone by the time Faith gets up in the morning, but then she notices strange things. One of the men left his watch behind and Faith finds a set of car keys in the weeds.

Faith finds it odd that Lola doesn't talk to her father, who spends most of his time near the hogs' slaughterhouse. She starts to wonder if these men Lola has been dating are really leaving in the mornings or is something else happening to them.

One day while nobody is looking, Faith slips into the slaughterhouse and unlocks the backroom. What she finds might just end her life?

I had absolutely no expectations when I started watching this movie, in which I had never heard of before. A lot of low-budget horror movies have horrible camera work, but not here as every scene is top-notch! After the movie ended, I googled for reviews about it and I was shocked to learn that many people didn't understand the movie. Especially, the part about the teeth being removed.

Spoiler Alert: Someone in the movie pulls someone's teeth out and then pulls their own teeth out, that way when the authorities find the disfigured body they will think it belonged to the killer as they can only confirm the identity of the body with the teeth!

I also read a few reviews that thought the movie was so boring! What was boring? I'm sick and tired of horror movies or what some people call torture porn, like the Hostel movies, that rely on graphic violence every five minutes as it leaves no room for the viewer's imagination.

The movie's plot is about abusive women and how they react to the aftermath of it. Faith tries to move on with her life by moving to the city, where as Lola...whoops, I said too much.

Yes, most modern horror films are predictable and, unfortunately, Slaughter has a few predictable spots, but then again it doesn't. I thought I had figured out what exactly was going on (aka&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-2-Disc-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2-Disc Ultimate Edition)</a>), especially when the father keeps going into the slaughterhouse and Lola's lovers keep going missing, but then there are several twists and turns that changes everything and builds up the suspense until the not-so happily ever after ending.

Slaughter isn't a perfect film, but it is an underrated horror yarn with decent acting, decent writing, and great directing. With Halloween around the corner, I would recommend others to rent or buy (I bought it for five dollars at Walmart in an eight movie set.) the movie, turn off the lights and enter into the slaughterhouse.",1347321600,4,3715,4.880952380952381

3744508,1,B001P9N9A8,"Slaughter (Stuart Hopewell, 2009)

Slaughter has the dubious distinction of being the third movie to almost get zero stars this weekend because I was this close to turning it off. I have only ever refused to watch three films to the end because of their sheer awfulness, and with a bit less intestinal fortitude, I could have doubled that in the past forty-eight hours with Slaughter, Zaat, and Heartstopper. I soldiered on, however, with all three for the sole purpose of making sure you would never have to do the same.

Slaughter is the incoherent, deeply boring tale of Faith (Veronica Guerin's Amy Shiels), a woman on the run for her abusive boyfriend Jimmy (Vance Daniels in his only screen role). She gets herself an apartment in the city, but on her first night there, she meets Lola (Cashback's Lucy Holt), who's in the process of being accosted by a guy. The two of them hit it off, and Faith ends up moving in with Lola on her family's farm. Things are kind of weird out there, though--Lola's father has banished her to the barn for reasons unknown and rarely leaves the farm's slaughterhouse, the farmhand seems sadistic to the point of psychosis, and everyone, of course, is covering up some huge secret, to which Faith seems all but oblivious thanks to her incessant nightmares of Jimmy finding her at the farm.

To this movie's credit, it does have some interesting psychological underpinnings, and a few things unfold in ways that, in a better movie, would have been worth your while. It's not that they're not things you don't expect, but they're at least textbook as opposed to popular movie psychology. There's also one of those last-frame revelations that, while it doesn't have much bearing on anything else in the movie, was pretty cool. (Compare to the one in, say, Dellamorte Dell'Amore, which changes the entire movie.) But neither of those things is enough to offset the first hour and twenty minutes of this hour and thirty-five-minute movie, which is hateful for so very, very many reasons. I understand that Shiels' character is supposed to be dull as dishwater, the kind of person who has ""doormat"" tattooed across her forehead, but in retrospect, is that really the kind of person you want as your reluctant investigator in a movie like this? If anything, Shiels plays her role too well, and has very little impact on the things that are happening around her; worse off, she breaks the main rule for a protagonist in a book, movie, etc. At no point here (unless it is forced upon her) does she change in any way. She's like a pebble in the middle of a dirt road upon which you keep stubbing your toe when you're walking to the fishing hole; eventually you just want to pry it up and fling it into the trees, never to be seen again. Contrast this to Lola, who's the classic (and clich&eacute;d) fast girl; where Hopewell obviously took some care with building Faith's character, Lola, who actually ends up driving the action in the film, seems like her personality was just an afterthought, cobbled together from remnants of Lifetime Original Movie characters in such a way as to advance the movie with minimum fuss. Everyone else in the film is a cardboard cutout. Combine with the characters the problems the movie has its pacing, which is just shy of nonexistent for the first hour and only marginally quicker thereafter, and you've got a recipe for a bad, bad film. And that's what you get. This is a horror film that is entirely absent of horror, but unlike many horror films of this stripe, it doesn't seek to replace the horror with anything else, leaving it devoid of reason for existence. Half a star because it did have some small semblance of potential.",1260403200,2,3694,4.715170278637771
3744509,1,B001P9N9A8,"When you see that a horror film has been written and directed by the same person, you can almost be assured that it's going to be bad and Slaughter doesn't fail to disappoint.  It's not only one of the worst of the After Dark Horror films of this year, but one of the worst in the three years of the series.  The fact that it was even included is stunning.  Have the pickings become so scarce?  Slaughter barely qualifies as a horror film and the only thing slaughtered here is your attention span as you fight to stay awake during this snooze fest.

Amy Shiels plays ""Faith"" a young girl who is running away from an abusive relationship.  She moves to the city but Jimmy still manages to track her down.  When we finally meet Jimmy later, you'll shake your head as he is completely unconvincing as sweet Faith's boyfriend.  Faith meets Lola (Lucy Holt) at a club and the two become fast friends.  Lola invites Faith to be her roommate on her family's farm.  Lola has her own living space above the barn and she is disconnected with her own family, particularly her stern father.  Faith soon learns that Lola isn't the sweet farm girl she makes herself out to be.  She has made a habit of meeting rich men and using them for whatever she can get, often luring them to the farm for one-night stands.

What Faith thinks is just promiscuity turns more sinister as she begins to explore the slaughterhouse and the secret locked room inside.  It excited me for a moment as there haven't been any really good hogs in a horror film since ""Motel Hell"" in 1980.  Unfortunately the plot turned out to be far less fun than that cult classic and devolved into a stupid tale of child abuse.  If it was supposed to make us sympathize for Lola it failed miserably as she was dim-witted and unlikable.

The only redeeming part of the film is its last 10 - 15 minutes which provide a modicum of action and suspense but even here, Faith has numerous opportunities to escape and yet manages to make one dumb move after another.",1258588800,,2008,4.442622950819672
3744510,2,B001P9N9A8,"If Hollywood has taught us anything, it's that when two young girls move in together, things are going to go bad!  One of them will inevitably be a psycho.  SLAUGHTER doesn't break that rule, and in fact comes off as a blend of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE.

Faith, on the run from an abusive husband, is out on the town with her friend when she spies Lola being accosted by a male suitor.  After rescuing her, the two become fast friends, and Faith eventually moves out to the farm where Lola lives with her father and two brothers.  But as the film (slowly) progresses, Faith begins to wonder what happens to the one-night stands Lola brings home every weekend.  And she wonders what's going on in that locked barn out there.  Why do Lola and her father never speak to each other?  Unfortunately, by the time she figures it all out, she's tied to a gurney and is now the subject of a devious plot to help ""recreate"" Lola's life.

Now, while this all sounds very interesting on paper (or not), the film manages to choke any suspense out of the setup with its slow-as-molasses pacing and subpar writing.  The two girls never seem to gel as ""BFFs"" for me, and I think it is less to do with acting, and more to do with writing.  The scenes leading up to the ""third act twist"" seem mostly to be filling time, as if the writers had a lot of ideas for the final 20 minutes, but couldn't think of what to do until then.  Indeed, you could really cut from the end of the first night Faith met Lola, to the moment she wakes up on the gurney, and really not have missed much.  It's like a generic 60-minute chick flick, with a thirty minute horror short tacked on at the end.

The big problem is that the shift in story is so sudden, and isn't really set up - that is, the change in Lola's character comes out of left field, and doesn't really seem earned by the first portions of the movie.  A better script would have had some glimpses into this shift, some lead-ins, well before the final turn.  The twists and turns during the final half-hour make that portion exciting and worth watching, but the final turn of the table is so ridiculously contrived, I found myself groaning at our heroine, who had AMPLE time to fire the gun!  And, call me a horror-prude if you want, but the final moment of the film I found reprehensible, even if it is a sad reality of the world we live in.

The cinematography is slightly above average, and the lead actors are better than you at first think they are.  Lola, at least, does a good turn when her true nature is revealed.  And the opening and closing moments are actually pretty damn good, as if they almost belong in a different, better film.

Of the 8 Films To Die For this year, I have to put it near the bottom of the heap - not as bad as PERKINS 14, about on par with DYING BREED.  I will give them this, though - of all the films, this one by far has the most cringe inducing moment, involving teeth and pliers, pulled off nicely even with very little blood!  That's saying something, I think.",1255132800,3,3050,4.302977232924693
3744511,4,B001P9N9A8,"Superb character development of Lucy Holt as Lola and Amy Shiels as Faith.  Two wayward lost souls searching for a new meaning in life...or is that ""death""?  No spoilers here.  You need to let this film/story unfold.  It was inspired by true events and is definitely a testimony on running from something you can never hide.  The best quote in the film sums up this 90 minute nugget from the ""After Dark Horrorfest III"" series:  ""Everyone deals with pain in their past differently.  Some choose to run from it by having as much fun as humanly possible.  Others choose to run from it and hide.""",1251936000,2,593,4.580952380952381
3744512,1,B001P9N9A8,"Like another viewer's comment, this movie sucks in many parts.
I knew the farmer's daughter is the troubled one already when last victimized girl met the daughter at the bar, her behavious and eyes betrayed her.

No one could see how the daughter chopped off her male victim's arm, and we might be convinced he was bleed to death, but the latter guy was alive when the city girl found him lying on the ground inside the room, but why he wasn't killed like the other guy? Weird. And this guy had a chance to get away for his life with or without the city girl, but was strangled by the daughter so easily before he could open the truck's door, and I really could not believed such a big and strong guy like him was actually that darn weak and strangled to death like this, absolutely not convincing!
The scene that the city girl's boyfriend suddenly showed up from nowhere together with another girl was pointless, and he was stupid too.
When he was questioning the daughter what had happened and what she had done with his girlfriend, the city girl still had a mood to fight with this boyfriend instead of telling him how monstrous the daughter is, how many people she had killed, and how crazy to removing teeth from her mouth, that is upsetting and frustrating.

The girl could have killed the derailed daughter, and could have saved the child and got away, she was weak! rifle being taken by the daughter, and she was just lying down, waiting for the daughter to shot her, how could that happen in real life?

It tells me that everyone wants to be killed by the daughter, and no one seemed to know what basic self-defense instinct is.

The ending is terrible that the daughter also killed her own son after she killed all the others, this is so very negative.

What was the director thinking???

Everything is made up reluctantly and does not make any sense at all!
