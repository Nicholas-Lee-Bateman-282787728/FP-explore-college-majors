5424564,5,B00AGKHG06,"Fun sequel to the original Night of the Demons.  It also features a young Christine Taylor from Zoolander, Brady Bunch movies and she is Ben Stiller's wife in real life.  Blood, gore, guts and nudity.  Great combo!  And it is now presented in a 16:9 aspect ratio not the full screen as it has been from previous versions.  The only extra you get is audio commentary from the director and someone else.  It is quite amusing to listen to as background noise.",1431302400,,456,4.5

5424567,4,B00AGKHG06,"The first Night of the Demons was a fun, silly, entertaining drive-in type of horror movie, engaging in a low-budget way in telling its story of party girl Angela, who hosts a Halloween party in a former cemetery, Hull House, that gets way out of hand when demons set out to posses both hostess and her guests.  This sequel, made six years later, follows up with Angela's younger sister Melissa - called Mouse - who resides in the dorms of a Catholic school, and is caught up in the maelstrom when some of the other students sneak out to Hull House and end up unleashing Angela into the world.  Can only a demonology student wielding a super-soaker gun full of holy water and a stern, yardstick-wielding nun who acts like Bruce Lee in a habit save the school?  The sequel plays the comedy factor up even more, though the blood and b-movie gore has its moments as well, in - surprisingly - a sequel that almost lives up to its original.  Almost.",1416873600,,944,4.47093023255814

5424571,4,B00AGKHG06,"No the best of the two original, but the sound and the picture are WAY better the VHS version by far!",1398124800,,101,3.857142857142857
5424572,5,B00AGKHG06,"No, not Angela from ""Sleepaway Camp,"" but the reigning Queen of Halloween Parties herself. It's not often that a sequel out does its predecessor, but this movie holds up to the same successful and incredible formula of humor, less gore, and light sex that made the first one a hit. This movie introduces us to Angela's little sister, Melissa, who should have become suspicious the moment her sister called her Mouse. That's a nickname she got after joining the Catholic school. Angela shouldn't have known that. I also thought that Perry [Bobby Jacoby] might have been the same little brother of Cathy Podewell's character from the first movie, but no dice. The real break-out star of course is Zoe Trilling playing Shirley Fenardi who tends to steal every scene she is in with a single line or her incredible figure. Overall The picture quality is great, the sound as well. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars.",1392336000,,910,4.729559748427673

5424574,4,B00AGKHG06,"Night of the demons 2

""Night of the Demons 2"", well first off i should admit that this movie is in no way a masterpiece. If you are new to the genre there are many others you probably should check out before you order this disc. However if you are like me and have been a fan for a long time, dwelling in the cult and b-movie swamp for years, you probably will have a great time with this wacky and wild little movie.

The second ""Night of the Demons"" is just as fun as the original entry in the trilogy and way better than the disapointing third part. So if you have not seen any of them and you are a fan of the genre you should definitely give the first two a go. They are both highly watchable and you may even end upp loving these movies. They are fun, gory and fast moving films with good production values and even some minor tension pops up from time to time.

This blu-ray release of ""Night of the Demons 2"" is surprisingly impressive for a movie of this caliber and time. The image quality might not be as beautifull, clear and crisp as when watching a newer movie but with everything concidered this movie looks great and should not only please but impress the viewer who decide to buy this disc.

As for sound, I must admit being more of a picture guy and I do not take much notice of audio quality unless if the audio were to be real useless. so I found it pleasing.

When talking extramaterial there are none that i can remember. But i have heard that there is a rather great commentry track with the director and that is always something.

All and all i highly recommend this movie and release for those who are interested in a cheesy, fun and mildly scary good time.",1375315200,5,1683,4.211180124223603
5424575,5,B00AGKHG06,"Having previously owned Night of the demons 2 on Lionsgate DVD, I can truly say this is a fantastic upgrade! The picture on the DVD was terrible, truly terrible. It was full screen and really muddy and dark. fortunately we've been given a fairly well remastered film. Also, its widescreen and that great! I didn't even know this was ever in widescreen, being that it was made for video. I'm so glad to have one of the original NOTD on blu, as I feel all 3 of the DVDs are underwhelming. But then again these are underground horror flicks so its not surprising.",1374710400,,560,4.446601941747573
8551417,5,B00AGKHG06,"Movie came as quickly as promised. No quality issues. Sad lack of special features for a Blu Ray but the movie itself is enough. If you love cheesy gory demonicism, youve come to the right movie!",1530057600,,195,4.444444444444445

8551421,5,B00AGKHG06,"I really like this movie, and the genre as well.  There's something about 1980's movies.  They are serious, funny, interesting, and reasonably fast-paced.

8551426,5,B00AGKHG06,"Director Brian Trenchard-Smith (Leprechaun 3, Leprechaun 4: In Space) picks up where Kevin Tenney (Night of the Demons, Witchboard 1-2) left off.  We find the now permanently demonic and prettier Angela (Amelia Kinkade; Night of the Demons 1-3) residing in the same haunted house where we left her possessed by a demon in 1988.

And staying true to the somewhat raunchy path paved by Tenney, Trenchard-Smith doles out the nudity early and heavily by suggesting that bedtime in the Catholic school girls dormitory means panties and topless time.

Creating a more formal continuity, the end of Night of the Demons (1988) is recounted as a dormitory ghost story noting that everyone was found mangled and dead except for Angela, who was missing and presumably remains a part of Hull House.  This ghost story is particularly troubling to Mouse (Merle Kennedy; May, Dollman, Leprechaun 3).

The actors in this sequel glow compare to those who came before them.  Both written and acted more convincingly, they include Z-Boy (Darin Heames; Dr. Giggles, Alien Nation: The Enemy Within), Rick (Rick Peters; Leprechaun 4: In Space), Terri (Christine Taylor; The Craft, Campfire Tales, Room 6) and Kurt (Ladd York; Leprechaun 4: In Space).

For his aptitude regarding the occult, Perry (Robert Jayne; Tremors 1 & 3 & TV series) seems to be modeled after Christian Slaters role in Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990), and Shirley (Zoe Trilling; Night Terrors, Dr. Giggles, Leprechaun 3) appears to be assuming Linnea Quigleys Night of the Demons (1988) role as the raunchy girl with the demonic lipstick-eating breasts.

Father Bob (Rod McCary; also Father Bob in Leprechaun 3, 976-Evil II, Komodo vs Cobra) and Sister Gloria (Jennifer Rhodes; Halloween, Slumber Party Massacre II, Charmed) run the Catholic school and both characters offer a lot of flavor and fun personality to this movie.

During preparations for the Halloween dance Perrys interest in demonology inspires him to perform a summoning ritual using the dark tome called the Necronomicon (not sure where he got that exactly) and Shirley rounds everyone up for a Halloween party at Hull House.  So what could possibly go wrong?  How about demonic possession?  Much as in the Evil Dead series (1981, 1987, 2013) and Demons 1-2 (1985, 1986), demonic possession is quite contagious.

Like its predecessorbut bigger and betterit has its raunchy moments, taking every opportunity to deliver boobs, bra and panty shots, more boobs, some sex scenes both demonic and human, and a LOT of sexy dancing.  Sexy demon-possessed dancing actually turns out to be a theme in this franchise, and Angela has returned to defend her title!

The raunchiness is heavily complemented by the campy yet clearly deliberate cheese factor.  For example, like in part 1 either injury or kissing transmits demonic possession like an STD and more often than not, its girl-on-girl kissing or forced kissing.  We also have demon heads in toilets, deliberately lame creepy shadow stalking and randomly poof appearing demons, a nun arming herself like shes Rambo, filling water balloons and super soakers with holy water, sexually aggressive demon hands and infernal trouser snakes, multiple sports references involving a severed head, a ninja turtle head-poking nun, during the sacrifice finale Angela actually seems to use the Force to paralyze two teenagers, and at one point they play stock footage of part 1 Angela (with shorter non-permed hair) floating down the hall.  Its all quite delightful.

This sequel is to Night of the Demons what Evil Dead 2 (1987) was to Evil Dead (1981); a remake masquerading as a sequel.  Only in this case, it builds on the story much as The Thing (2011) was a prequel that replayed key scenes from the 1981 original as if it were a remake.  And like The Thing (2011) and Evil Dead 2 (1987), it offers a lot more of everything.  More boobs, more melty demons, more raunchiness, more cheesy ploys, more sexy dancing, more lipstick scenes and more gore.

The effects and gore include more demonic faces with mangled demon teeth, an infernal acidic handshake, bloody decapitation, a phallic lipstick demon parasite, holy water-soaked gore-slathered demons melting like Gremlins (1984), snake monster Angela and a deliciously chunky gory explosion. There is a solid range of horror effects entertainment.

Additionally, this sequel makes a great callback to the fan favorite Night of the Demons lipstick scene.  The very lipstick Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) inserted into her breast is discovered again.  After an attempted mouth-rape impregnation, the lipstick transforms into a fleshy tendril and crawls up into a girl like the Evil Dead (1987, 2013) tree rapeit was not consensual.  Its gross and quite provocative, and now its possessed this young lady and imbued her with demonic breasts which then literally attack someone!

In the end evil is vanquished and the demonic lipstick is found outside of the Catholic school to usher in another sequelwhich does in fact come along in 1997 followed by a 2009 remake.

However campy this sequel may be, the writing is far more credible (i.e., less silly), the acting is superior, and there is actually some substance and reason to the story.  Whether you love gore, boobs, or gore on boobs (yep, that happens), this movie is for you.  Honestly, even if not a single breast populated this movie, it would still be a popcorn favorite of mine.  Its loads of fun, its never slow, and there is a broad range of gross effects waiting to entertain you.

Highly recommended.",1476489600,,5570,5.0790340285400655
