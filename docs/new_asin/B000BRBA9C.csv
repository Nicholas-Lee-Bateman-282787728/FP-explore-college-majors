2438474,5,B000BRBA9C,"Went to order MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN dvd as a gift and saw that it was available as a combined dvd package with BRAM STIKER'S DRACULA at a great pricepoint. Neither of these movies are readily available to rent, nor or they shown very often on television. Both films are beautifully crafted, visually stunning, and more true to the original written works than many other film versions. I purchased two sets - one to give and one to keep. This would be a wonderful choice to add to your video library.",1191196800,2,505,4.622222222222222
2438475,5,B000BRBA9C,"I agree with the kid who wrote the last review.  These are exceptionally well done films and are very faithful to the novels. The performances are all exceptional (save for some of Winona Ryder's British accent in Dracula)with perfect casting. I also have the same complaints : 'Where are the special features?' and 'Why is Frankenstein in FULLSCREEN only? Why must studios screw good movies over in just Fullscreen (Moonstruck)? Couldn't it just as easily been widescreen or both(also Moonstruck)?' And yes, Dracula does need a new menu doesn't it?
P.S.- I highly reccomend the film WOLF, just as the kid who wrote the last review did. It is sleek and intelligent (just like the box says!) and is also filled with exceptional performances.",1143417600,2,740,4.967741935483871
2438476,4,B000BRBA9C,"Both are great movies and i'm hoping this year both get a nice treatment, they should be Special Editions!",1135641600,,106,4.631578947368421
2438477,5,B000BRBA9C,"Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 version of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and Kenneth Branagh's 1994 ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" are classics in their own right. Now, for the first time, these two faithful adaptations of the classic Gothic horror novels are available together for your ultimate viewing pleasure. Though this set hasn't been released yet, I have both of these great films (one on DVD-damn shame that it is only available in full screen and with no special features apart from the trailers [one for the feature film itself, the other two for ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and ""Awakenings""] and the other on VHS). See my reviews on both films and the novels on which they are based. ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" is rated PG for some violence. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" is rated PG-13 for some violence and brief sensuality/nudity.",1132704000,,829,5.102941176470588
2438488,5,B000BRBA9C,Five stars but certainly not for the trash Dracula film but for the excellent Frankenstein. Dracula was a disjointed over done attempt at art rather than a tale that I couldn't wait to be over. Frankenstein on the other hand was a masterpiece of humanity that had you both hating the monster and caring for him. Good and evil but who pays for the evil mistakes of man? This is one Frankenstein you should not miss. Throw the Dracula disk away or give it to somebody you mildly like.,1500768000,,482,4.426966292134831

2438504,3,B000BRBA9C,"Received DVD set packaged with 20 other DVD's and a keychain, the outside dust sleeve holding the individual disc's has been crushed all the way through on the back side! Also the case for Frankenstein has been crushed all the way through, the disc itself seems undamaged but the dust cover and 1 of the disc case's had been crushed either through shipping or was already like this before they shipped it! I'm not going to go through the hassle of sending it back if the DVD works, if not I will go through the process! Just not very satisfied, I would like to damage the DVD sets myself and not buy them brand new with damage to them!!!",1426723200,,637,4.361344537815126

2438513,5,B000BRBA9C,Excellent movie and it adds to our already great thriller/mystery collection.  Received the dvd well before the expected date and watched it the first night. DVD is in great shape with vivid and sharp picture and sound. Excellent and professional service!,1354579200,,255,5.219512195121951
2438514,5,B000BRBA9C,"The ""Dracula"" video seemed to adhere quite closely to the Bram Stoker writing, with only a few variations.  I enjoyed this movie particularly to see the acting expertise of Gary Oldman. Hard to believe this was the same man that was the crooked DEA cop in ""Leon,The Professional"".
In the same ""vein"" I very much enjoyed ""Mary Shelly's Frankenstein"", although I did not read this book. Robert DiNiro was excellent in the role, and the special effects in the laboratory was unbelievable. I think one critic said it was ""Visually stunning"" as to the landscape where it was filmed. The Swiss Alps, I believe. Parts of this movie were quite gory, but not to the point of turning away. I found the ending of this story very moving and the movie well worth watching.
Neither of these movies are the same as the Dracula & Frankenstein flicks of the late 30's and 40's. Seen 'em all.  R.E.W.",1353715200,,882,4.611464968152866
2438515,3,B000BRBA9C,"My review of these films is definitely in the minority.  They are not films I'd watch a second time.  The Lugosi and Karlof versions I have watched at least 10 times -- they are so much better.

Coppola's Dracula is visually entertaining, with a different twist on the story -- now it's a love story spread across the centuries.  Okay, I'll play along.  The acting, as noted in other reviews, leaves much to be desired.  Gary Oldman as Dracula just doesn't cut it -- never in this film do you believe he could attract Winona Ryder.

Branagh's Frankenstein is really his attempt at doing everything in the film (direct, star, re-write the script) and doing nothing well.  Casting De Niro as Frankenstein's monster was another blunder.  Also, Branagh is first a teenager, then a college student, then a married man in his 30's -- but he doesn't physically change one bit.  He looks basically the same at each period of his life.

Both films could have lost a half hour of the script and not affected their story lines.",1242950400,,1016,4.620111731843576
2438516,2,B000BRBA9C,Am a college English teacher.  Was hoping to show film in upcoming English class -- as part of my theme.  Was not expecting R-rating.  Now am not so sure I want to show it.,1199923200,,172,4.0
2438517,4,B000BRBA9C,"I am a big fan of reading and these two books have always been a favorite. Both movies stay true to the main events and characters in the books, Dracula more so then Frankenstein. The trouble with any visual production of Frankenstein is most of the terror is psychological and portrayed through thoughts in the book and never spoken aloud. However, despite its flaws and changes in the plot Frankenstein is enjoyable. Dracula does wonders for fans of the original book and spin offs of the character Van Helsing. Anthony Hopkins truly captures the essence of the man and all the archetypes most people attribute to him. The changes in the plot of events are more minor in Dracula, but a added a little more depth to some of the characters. But I enjoyed these movies and so did all those I introducedto them.",1197072000,3,809,4.625

They are both great quality, the dvds play just fine (each movie is on it's own disc). A perfect pre Halloween purchase!

I'd gladly give this comb set as a gift.",1513296000,,307,3.857142857142857

8091319,3,B000BRBA9C,"Not sure if I just received a bad copy or if it's the quality due to being a double movie.  Frankenstein's audio quality is poor.  Sounds muffled and had a buzzing sound through most of the movie.  I would have rated this less, but I'll probably never watch Frankenstein again as I forgot how dramatic and absurd they made the film.  Dracula's audio was fine though.",1507766400,,366,4.5
