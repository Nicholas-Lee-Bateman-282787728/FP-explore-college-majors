3589161,3,B001FTIK2A,"Got this for the store as I am a big fan of Alda, and at least in that category it did not disappoint.

A story of dysfunction, memory loss, Alzheimer's and a priceless baseball card. Really, the only description worth the time is the story between Alda and Broderick's characters as uncle and nephew. Both have memory loss issues for different reasons, and they try to muddle through a couple unplanned days together. The centerpiece of their new found time is deciding what to do with their lives and a million dollar baseball card.

All of the performances are painful except for Alda. He alone gives this corny film three stars. I played it in the store which both helped and hurt, as any scene where dumb people are doing dumb things it looks like a slapstick comedy, but when Alda gives those looks of pain and forgetfulness - it seems like a masterpiece. No special features, would be rated R for the tons of ""F"" bombs and other language.",1242950400,4,945,4.552941176470588
3589162,3,B001FTIK2A,"A semi-sweet comedy, with a stellar cast, about our misgivings and growing old and all the steps that happen along the way.",1241740800,,123,4.636363636363637
8302688,2,B001FTIK2A,"Filled with star power this is about a grown Ferris Bueller who works at a newspaper as an editor. He has suffered a blow to the head which has caused him to have lost some mental capacity leaving him almost CTE-like.

He is requested to return to his hometown to oversee his Uncle Hawkeye Pierce who appears to be in the beginning states of dementia. Upon arrival he encounters his old girlfriend and her struggling son. Her ex-husband is terrorizing Uncle for his ancient baseball card for its extreme high value.

A trip back to Chicago ensues so the gal can attempt to sell her painting and to attend a sports card show to raise some funds with the vintage cardboard. Sure enough, they encounter a mean card dealer and things go haywire. Multiple on-screen meltdowns as well as swearing and general unpleasant situations make this not a fun or easy watch. Also see 'Swindle' which features some of the same plot situations.",1519171200,,927,4.680981595092025

8302691,2,B001FTIK2A,"Diminished Capacity has a talented cast, but they don't have enough to work with. It has some wit, but not enough. It has some sweet moments, but not enough. It has some slapstick, but  well, it has too much slapstick, because it didn't work. Like this movies version of the Cubs, its not terrible, but it doesnt quite succeed. I did like the closing line about joining the party, while theres still some daylight, though. Maybe next year.",1447027200,,439,4.628205128205129
8302692,4,B001FTIK2A,"I wasn't crazy about Alda's accent (his natural accent would've worked better), but the characters are believable and they meshed with the story.  It's a simple, relaxing movie to watch at the end of a hectic day.",1430956800,,213,4.756756756756757
8302693,2,B001FTIK2A,"Except maybe for the cast, especially Alan Alda and a few laughs along the way. Other than that, a waste of my time. Hollywood can do better. I think.",1379894400,,150,4.206896551724138
8302694,1,B001FTIK2A,"Unless PG is the new R this movie was mis-rated. Plenty of foul language.  Other than that, I agree with those who said Alan Alda carried it; his matter-of-fact comedic approach never disappoints.",1369267200,,196,4.9393939393939394
8302695,2,B001FTIK2A,"A friend recommended this film to me, though he was only lukewarm about it.  The movie had some funny moments, but
very little of interest really happens, and the central point of an extremely valuable baseball card leads to a lot of silly over
the top shenanigans which were more dumb than funny.  Not awful, just not much here.  A waste of great talent.",1366156800,3,355,4.515625
8302696,4,B001FTIK2A,I enjoyed the interactions of characters in this story; very down to earth.  Funny and awkward situations regarding a family member with dementia.  I'd recommend this movie for family viewing.,1264809600,,192,5.366666666666666
8302697,5,B001FTIK2A,"Hi!  I'm glad I bought this video.  I usually get them out of the library, and I belong to 2 different regional libraries, but neither one had this.  I'm brain-injured and I could really relate to and understand from personal experience the issues Alan Alda and Matthew Broderick had.  As for buying it from Amazon, I feel that I got it at a VERY reasonable price and it was as stated--LIKE NEW.",1255219200,,395,4.444444444444445
