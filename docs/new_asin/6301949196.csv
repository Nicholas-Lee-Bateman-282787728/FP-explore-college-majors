7817400,5,6301949196,"Thomas Hughes' novel, ""Tom Brown's School Days"" was written in 1857; this film was made nearly a century later and more than 60 years have passed since it premiered in 1951.  Yet the story remains incredibly timely, despite some dated elements.  It presents a no-nonsense look at the psychological ordeal young children still experience when leaving home for the first time and the process of meeting new people of all kinds and learning how to judge and deal with them.  But it is even more timely given the increased attention that is being paid to bullying in our own time.  The story is largely about bullying of the most abusive kind, including physical violence.  The younger children who are bullied, especially Tom, find a way to deal with it, but viewers may find their solution a bit too pat and unrealistic.  Nonetheless, this is a bold and stark attempt to portray the problem and its brutality.

The film features a marvelous cast, all perfectly suited to their roles, including John Howard Davies as Tom, John Charlesworth as his pal, ""Scud"" East, Robert Newton as the headmaster (in a rare, beautifully underplayed performance), and John Forrest as the bully, Flashman.  Other familiar faces from that era of British filmmaking include Hermione Baddeley, Brian Worth, Francis De Wolff, James Hayter, and Michael Hordern.",1384128000,,1335,5.009049773755656

7817402,4,6301949196,"TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS is a British remake of the 1940 Jimmy Lydon picture (both are based on the 1857 Thomas Hughes novel), which was itself a remake of a sient film. In it, Tom is a student at venerable Rugby boarding school (founded 1567). A long-standing legend, similar to American Abner Doubleday's formal creation of baseball, says that a Rugby student named William Webb Ellis set down the rules of a rugged field game that has since taken the school's name. Neither stories are likely true.

The star of this movie, John Howard Davies, is closer in age to Hughes' Tom (11) than Lydon (who's best known for the Henry Aldrich series), however the earlier version adheres more closely to the book.

As a new arrival at Rugby, Tom like all before him must endure forms of hazing. His ordeals are worse than most other boys experience, as Flashman the school bully makes him a target. Tom undergoes various humiliations and tortures (including having his legs singed by a roaring fire) but eventually gets revenge on Flashman with the help of his friend, 'Scud' East.

Robert Newton plays the school's most renowned headmaster, Dr. Thomas Arnold, a reformer whose many innovations helped forged the modern British public school system. Newton is best known for his flamboyant portrayal in film and on TV of peglegged pirate&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Long-John-Silver/dp/B000FOQ1KE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Long John Silver</a>.

7817403,5,6301949196,"""Tom Brown's Schooldays"" is a cinema gem and a true classic in
every sense of the word.

A British production made in 1951 and based on the classic
Thomas Hughes novel of the same name, it is the story about
Victorian England school life at Rugby School for boys.
Starring Robert Newton and juvenile actor John Howard Davies,
this film is carried by both of these excellent actors who
head an exceptional British cast.

The story tells of bullying, brutality and intimidation of the
younger boys by the older boys which was rife at the school.
It is into this atmosphere that young Tom Brown (John Howard
Davies) is thrust to begin his schooling. Tom soon settled in
making friends and following the routine way of life which
included the good times as well as the bad. The story tells
how Tom eventually overcomes adversity and defeats his
tormentors.

There are two versions available on this DVD - one is in
black and white and the other is a colorized version.
Whilst I have never been a lover of colorized movies, I have
to admit that this color version is remarkable. The print
and sound have been digitally restored to a pristine condition.

A ""must have"" for all lovers of fine movies.",1275868800,6,1193,4.613207547169812
7817404,5,6301949196,"This is the film that made me a Billy Halop fan. He plays Flashman, the villain of the film, who constantly tortures Tom throughout his stay in the film. Halop seems to be so ignored anymore in print and it's a shame. He was the greatest of the Dead End Kids and any film with an appearance by him is that much better. Tom is played to naive perfection by Jimmy Lydon and a teenaged Freddie Bartholomew is his buddy, East. Sir Cedric Hardwicke rounds out the cast and there's an appearance by Polly Moran, who, if I'm not mistaken, was also featured in the lost Lon Chaney silent film, ""London After Midnight"". TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS is one of the all time great films about growing up - but be sure this 1940 version is the one you get; there was a remake in the 50's. You won't regret it!
