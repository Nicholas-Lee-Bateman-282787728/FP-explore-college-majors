1005960,2,6305269149,"It's true that van Beuren studios made animation history with some of these short features.  There are some astonishingly sophisticated anime effects, great colouring, and so forth, in many of the shorts.  They belong  on any serious collector's shelf.  But...
... for this viewer anyway, the  repeated doses of nasty racism really spoiled the experience.  Some of  these toons should have been excerpted in van Peebles' great documentary  ""Classified X"" -- as indicators of the spirit of their times,  they are pretty darn depressing.
While I'm NOT in favour of bowdlerizing  or other attempts to alter history, I think it's weird that the jacket  reviewers make no mention, apologetic or otherwise, of this offensive  content.  If these toons offended me, a white viewer, what would their  impact be on, say, a Black parent who got them for the kids to watch?  Sheesh.  At least the public deserves a prominent note of warning on the  box.",921974400,29,941,4.967741935483871
1006021,3,6305269149,Kind of fun to see very old cartoons that I may have seen when I was young. The black and white made it seem even more dated.,1372550400,,125,3.6666666666666665
1006022,5,6305269149,"I was happy to find these. They bring back memories of my childhood, and I can share that with my children. My 3yr old son loved this, as did my 3 yr old nephew",1364083200,,160,3.735294117647059
1006023,4,6305269149,"After watching the two volume collections of Ub Iwerks early cartoons, I wanted more, so I took a chance on this Van Beuren collection from the Cartoons That Time Forgot series. These shorts may not be of the same quality as early Disney, but they are certainly worth the time of any animation history buff. While this set isn't at a bargain price like the other two sets, it can be found less expensive if you look around. This set features 21 cartoons and for the most part they look very good to excellent, with most of the wear being at the beginning of each short during titles and the first 10 seconds or so of the shorts. Have they been remastered? .....probably not completely, but besides a little wear here and there, they are presented uncut and look pretty clear and not washed out.

This set was release before the two Iwerks sets and it has the basic menu. The menu could have used a little work to make it a little more user friendly. You can play all the cartoons or look at the scene selection for individual titles, but once you start the cartoon from any point, it will play all from that point. Meaning you have to stop after each cartoon and go to the menu if you want to skip around and see selected shorts. It's not a huge deal, but it could have been easily fixed with a few adjustments.

Is it worth buying, absolutely! it has 21 rare shorts that may never look any better or be released again. Even though the price is pretty steep(cheaper if you look around), you get a nice collection of cartoons from a studio who was one of the pioneer in animation. The shorts are not the best produced from the time period, but I enjoyed these cartoons very much.",1299628800,,1678,4.357827476038339
1006024,4,6305269149,"First, let me quote animation historian Leonard Maltin: ""The Van Beuren studio is the least-known cartoon company of the 1930s, yet its brief history is dotted with interesting films and major animation talents"".
Although I think this DVD could be a little cheaper, I found some magnificent examples of colossal imagination and, overall, I think this is way more interesting than the two volumes devoted to Ub Iwerks in this same ""Cartoons that Time Forgot"" series.
This collections emphasizes on the colour cartoons, when director Burt Gillett (of ""Three Little Pigs"" fame) was hired. I wish there would be more of the black & white ones, which have gags and style similar to the Max Fleischer's 'Betty Boop' cartoons. There's only one episode of 'Cubby Bear' and one of 'The Little King'. In contrast, Molly Moo Cow (which I didn't find interesting as a character) appears in some five or six cartoons. There are also three 'Felix the Cat' colour cartoons, which may be the first attempt to add a voice to a character that was originally silent.
To deepen into the black & white era of the Van Beuren studio, one could buy the collections devoted to 'The Little King', 'Cubby Bear' and 'Tom and Jerry' (not the cat and mouse). But I insist, this DVD is good as a quick look to eight years of production from an unfairly underrated team of animators.",1280016000,,1351,4.753191489361702
1006025,5,6305269149,Great quality on these old cartoons! Maybe they have been restored. Contains many cartoons that I saw as a child many years ago.,1271980800,,128,4.608695652173913

1006027,3,6305269149,"Van Beuren was a B-grade animation studio in the Max Fleischer vein. Regardless of the tight budgets, Van Beuren produced some bizarre and truly memorable cartoons during the early 1930s - particularly those featuring the musical antics of Tom and Jerry. ""Cartoons That Time Forgot"" includes some of the duo's best shorts: ""Piano Tooners,"" ""Wot a Night"" and ""The Tuba Tooter."" Another minor classic is ""The Sunshine Makers"" (1935) in which cheerful dwarfs conquer grim-faced gremlins with bottles of sunshine. Unfortunately, Van Beuren's misguided attempts to emulate Disney and resurrect Felix the Cat fall flat. Though an uneven collection, this DVD has several underrated gems worth seeking out.",1104710400,10,698,5.472222222222222
1006028,4,6305269149,"The Van Beuren studio made some very interesting cartoons during 1929-1936.
This collection includes several black-and-white Aesop's Fables cartoons, which, although unsuccessful at the time, they are real gems. The B/W cartoons are a combination of bizarre, surreal gags with basic animation. Some good cartoons in this category includes ""In a Cartoon Studio"", a spoof on the making of a cartoon, and ""Candy Town"", where two cats eats all the candy contained inside the moon, only to be chased by a bottle of castor oil and a spoon! Strange, but brilliant!
Also, the DVD includes the original Tom & Jerry (no, not the cat & mouse, but a tall, thin man and a short, fat guy). Although the characters themselves are bland, the cartoon themselves still shows off the odd sense of humour that is typical of the studio. One example is in the cartoon ""Piano Tooners"", where Tom plays a bad note on the piano, only for Jerry to ""catch"" the note, and then flushes it down an off-screen toilet! Another Tom & Jerry cartoon is ""Wot a Night"" (their first cartoon), which is a spooky but very weird cartoon.
However, the B/W cartoons were not successful, and so Van Beuren assigned Burt Gillett (who directed Walt Disney's ""Three Little Pigs"") to create a new colour cartoon series called ""Rainbow Parade"". Gillett tried to make these cartoons as good as his previous boss, but that's why these cartoons are generally not as good as they should be (although they are not terrible), because he tried to imitate Disney rather than innovate. Characters like Molly Moo Cow and Toonerville Trolley were not good choices, and neither was the return of Felix the Cat, as he was turned into a goody two-shoes kind of a character. Oddly enough, the Felix cartoons were some of the best efforts of the series. Perhaps the best cartoon was ""The Sunshine Makers"", where the happy elves tries to bring happiness to a bunch of gloomy elves by bombarding them with sunshine milk. The series ended in 1936 when the Van Beuren studios closed down, due to its distributors RKO switching to Walt Disney for their cartoons!
There are 21 cartoons in total, and all are of good picture and sound quality considering they are public domain cartoons. Most of the Rainbow Parade cartoons have their original titles restored, with only a few B/W cartoons retaining their original titles.
Overall, this is good collection of rare cartoons, and is still an essential purchase for classic animation lovers. Personally, they should have included a few more B/W cartoons, but I'm more than happy with this DVD!",1044144000,37,2568,4.851936218678816
1006029,3,6305269149,"I've always been fascinated with hard-to-find items and this one was pleasing for that reason.  Van Beuren Studios have been all but forgotten so it was with wonder that I discovered the familiar 'Little King' and 'Toonerville Trolley' as well as shock at witnessing the ENTIRE 'Molly Moo-Cow' series (can you believe it?).  The print quality is excellent and most of these are in color.  Be advised though, these are not great stories (most of them are numbingly plotless) and the price is rather steep.  If you want to watch some obscure cartoons and you have the cash to spare...go for it.  Safe for the kiddies too.

7887009,4,6305269149,A good collection of color and black and white cartoons from the Van Beuren studios of the 30s.  The quality is mostly quite good.

I bought this after reading a review that said this goes with the Thunderbean Rainbow Parade collection to complete the set.  That one has a far superior copy of The Sunshine Makers.,1408752000,,412,4.680555555555555
