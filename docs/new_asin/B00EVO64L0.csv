8609886,5,B00EVO64L0,"I own several Charles Reid books and now three DVDs.  This and Figurative Watercolors are my favorites (All three are excellent).  In this one he specifically focuses on sketchbook painting in the lovely setting of the Cotswolds, UK.  The production value is quite good and on my widescreen TV I can clearly see his method and color choices.  I find Reid's work so imaginative and inspiring, and in this DVD, I can watch the magic unfold.",1474329600,4,438,4.723684210526316
