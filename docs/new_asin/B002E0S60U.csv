3915104,3,B002E0S60U,"Joey (1977) Deliver Us from Evil (USA (DVD)new title)
Overall, I still abhor Horace Jackson's direction and the photography - but you have to really love the Violent Blaxploitation melodramas of the '70's to watch this thing in its entirety today. I never wound up really caring about these characters in here, either. Maybe you have to be from the '70's to relate.

The Fox Affair (1978)
Couldn't watch this low-budget comedy, action-kung-fu fighting Movie. Even before the movie began, the imagery was disturbing. It was macabre, Hong Kong exploitation revulsion.",1247443200,,565,5.208791208791209

8366658,4,B002E0S60U,"This was really a pretty decent movie.  It just goes to show you that greed & murder never get you very far in life.  Money is a great thing to have, but when you're splitting it up between 5 or 6 men there's bound to be trouble.  George Kennedy was great as the antagonist, pushing these men to their limits & unfortunately greed can be a compelling motivator.  With only 3 men left towards the end of the movie, Kennedy's inability to let go of the money eventually leaves him freezing to death.  Jan Michael Vincent's  character does the honorable & right thing in the end; he saves his companion's life.  Character, integrity & a respect for another person's life ultimately wins.  Give it a chance.",1353715200,2,703,4.523809523809524
8366659,5,B002E0S60U,"I disagree with the other reviewer (Fred).  I saw this only once over 25 years ago and have never forgotten it.  Was it that good?  Well, it apparently made an impression on my young mind. Add to that I've always liked Jan-Michael Vincent.  Other favorites of mine with JMV during this time were ""Tribes"" and ""Buster and Billie"".  If Jan-Michael Vincent seemed he'd rather be somewhere else in this movie it was probably because he was the only one that did not want any part of taking the ill-gotten money (at least intially).  He was the only one with a conscience of right and wrong wanting to do the right thing.  This movie really makes one think what one would do if in a similar situation. ( ""Deliverance"" with John Voight and Burt Reynolds was a similar scenario.)  Overall I think this was and is a very good movie.  How good?  Good enough I still remember it more than 25 years later after seeing it only one time!",1329696000,5,924,4.446428571428571
8366660,2,B002E0S60U,"I have always been a big fan of the ""golden era"" of those long forgotten, 'good & bad', but always interesting TV movies [TVM] of the mid to late 60's and early to late 70's. Many were produced by Aaron Spelling and included the landmark THAT CERTAIN SUMMER [1972], the cult favorite TRIBES [1970], the ever-popular BRIAN'S SONG [1971] and the seminal Nam soaper BALLAD OF ANDY CROCKER [1969]. Only the latter was produced by Spelling. Some tackled serious topics, such as homosexuality/Nam/the drug culture, while others just stayed basic dealing with murder, mystery or satanism, the latter a hot topic in the early 70's after the classic ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]. Some were well-made and thought-provoking while others were superficial, hokey, soapy +/or hastily put together. They were usually intriguing and/or entertaining, though, most likely because of the diverse array of respected, veteran protagonists [i.e. Bing Crosby, DR. COOK'S GARDEN, 1970; Leslie Nielsen, CAN ELLEN BE SAVED, 1974; Richard Boone, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, 1971;] and young, future stars [Martin Sheen, THAT CERTAIN SUMMER; Jan-Michael Vincent, TRIBES; Burt Reynolds, RUN SIMON RUN, 1970]. Where else could you see a 40's femme noir star [Agnes Moorehead] in the same movie with rising stars [Lee Majors/Joey Heatherton] and an R & B/pop music icon [Marvin Gaye]. Many of us baby-boomers were teenagers or young adults during this golden era and have fond memories of many of these presentations---the TVM of the week being a lively topic of banter upon return to classes or work.

  DELIVER US FROM EVIL [1973] had the intriguing title, and the DVD has the eye-catching cover art, but nothing else. It is about a motley group of weekend campers out in the wilderness who come upon a D.B. Cooper-like fellow who parachutes near them with stolen money. They unwittingly kill the guy then proceed to divy up the cash. Then it's time to get outta there. This is low-budget fare with torpid, going-through-the-motions performances including an uncharacteristically awful and annoying George Kennedy [COOL HAND LUKE, 1967, and the NAKED GUN films]. The only one who delivers is a pre-DALLAS Jim Davis, always a seasoned, natural, yet underappreciated actor, who is cogent as usual. When Davis falls off a cliff and perishes early on, you know this movie is in trouble. Even a young Jan-Michael Vincent looks as if he'd rather be somewhere else. There is endless traipsing through the wilderness with nothing much happening except listening to Kennedy's vitriol. Thankfully, at the end, Kennedy procures the same fate as Jake Torrence in THE SHINING.

  The DVD itself has no extras, as is the case for Warner Brothers' [WB] ""Archive Collection"" DVD-R's. The print is clear and very good but uneven as some scenes look sharp and others appear a trifle grainy---definitely not a remastered print. The price is excessive given it's a lousy movie; you are paying for the rarity as many of these WB films have never been on DVD and this may be the only way to ever see them. I recommend buying a used copy for about 10 bucks or less, or wait and see if WB repeats this year's Black Friday Sale of ""five-for-fifty"". I was able to purchase five DVD's retailing at just under $100 for fifty dollars---great deal. Still, WB should cut down their prices.

  Again, a very disappointing TVM and recommended only if you are a steadfast fan of this genre from those times [as I am] or as a curiosity piece to check out a young Jan-Michael Vincent, a pre-Jock Ewing Jim Davis and a pre-NAKED GUN George Kennedy.",1295136000,3,3567,4.951505016722408
