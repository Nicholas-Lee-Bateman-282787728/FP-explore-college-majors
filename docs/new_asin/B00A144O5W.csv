5374829,2,B00A144O5W,This movie has some beautiful looking people and they are acting well but the storyline is not worth the money.  it's been done a million times.,1361491200,,144,4.538461538461538
5374830,5,B00A144O5W,"JUST SEE IT!  But don't read the movies description because it gives the ""surprise"" away!  After I saw this exciting film, I read the description and was so glad I didn't read it first before seeing the film!  It would be like buying a ""who done it book, which tells the reader who did it on the book jacket!""

Yet another excellent performance by Tim Roth.  He even makes the other unknown actors look terrific with his understated, intense expressions that say so much more than any dialogue can.  Bravo!",1360713600,7,506,4.566666666666666
5374831,5,B00A144O5W,"Used to be you could discover a movie for yourself. Roll home late, switch on the TV, next thing you know you're glued to the sofa long past bedtime. Or maybe you were hypnotized by the second movie in the double bill at a long-dead indie rep. Left the theatre banging on about it to all your friends. Not any more. Thanks Internet.

So when a movie comes along that looks like one thing, turns out to be something else, and draws you in so completely you feel you're in the middle of an actual discovery all of your own, enjoy it. All that earnest amateur analysis you skimmed online beforehand, the radioactive comparisons with other flicks, the petulant certainties about genre shortcomings, pay none of it any heed. Instead, hand yourself over to the people with the actual talent. Go where the writer and the film makers take you.

The Liability is a movie worth discovering for yourself. The poster of a geezer with a shooter gives a broad hint of what to expect and there is a full identity parade of crime flick archetypes: the middle-aged killer who wants to pack it in, the nave kid who thinks he fancies the life, a properly evil crime boss, a put-upon moll, even an exotic beauty with razor blade cheek bones. But these characters exist only to service a weird and sinewy plot in an unhinged, off-kilter reality in a parallel England of no policemen, deep dark woods and American diners. Nothing proceeds as it should.

Tim Roth, distantly echoing his young gun in Stephen Frears's 1985 movie The Hit, thoroughly enjoys himself as the professional holding it together with mystified cool as chaos randomly explodes around him. Jack O'Connell was born to play the eager-to-please would-be gangster who not only has to be smarter than he looks, actually might be. Tallulah Riley (who knew?), takes a very modern femme fatale and makes her all her own. Peter Mullen cranks his scary man act to new levels of terror, and as his broken down moll, Kiersten Wareing creates miracles with barely any screen time at all, revealing lifetimes of grief through the tiniest flicker of her densely mascara'd eyes.

Working from John Wrathall's sharp and hilarious script, director Craig Viveiros and DP James Friend have manufactured a series of iconic visual moments that endlessly defy what must have been a traditionally tiny British movie budget. This film is worth checking out if only to see how to make the most of one of those American-style OK Diners that dot the A roads around the UK.

A movie that keeps you guessing with a grin on your face even when you know it's leading you up a blind alley, The Liabilty is
dense with crime cinema lore but no less enjoyable if you've never seen a hit man movie in your life. It's a genuine British eccentric there to be discovered on its own terms.",1360627200,7,2797,4.653846153846154
5374832,3,B00A144O5W,"Peter (Peter Mullan) is a crime boss who deals in human trafficking. His step-son Adam (Jack O'Connell) is the ""son he never wanted."" Peter has Adam work for him to pay off a debt. He is to be a driver for Roy (Tim Roth) a quiet reserved hitman as opposed to the chatter-box Adam. As expected things don't go right, but then the film adds an additional twist to it.

The movie is a substandard grindhouse. The music, action, killing, and dialouge are a cut below. Roy steals a Grenada to perform their hit as the car is hot wired, yet has no trouble opening the trunk. Peter lives in a huge house, yet Adam's bed is right next to his mom's and Peter's bedroom. While this makes for film continuity, it is indicative of the missed details and missed opportunity this film had. May be worth a rental to British crime film fans.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, rape.",1360368000,4,861,4.408805031446541
5374833,5,B00A144O5W,"Dark, funny British hitman thriller, takes you places you didn't expect to go, both plotwise and geographically (it's set in the Northeast of England). Tim Roth, Peter Mullan, Jack O'Connell (soon to be seen in 300 prequel) are all on cracking form. And Talulah Riley. Wow! What a revelation. She sure was wasted in St Trinian's!",1360195200,7,329,4.892857142857143
5374834,3,B00A144O5W,"""For a guy to get along in this world he has to be very very careful."" When slacker Adam (O'Connell) gets offered a job by his moms boyfriend to drive for a hit-man named Roy he gets more then he bargained for. What starts off as a simple assignment takes a turn for the worse as he encounters murders, sex trafficking and double crosses. I was very much looking forward to this movie. The producers of ""Snatch"" and ""Lock Stock"" made me excited to see it. The last movie I remember seeing that line on was ""Layer Cake"" which was awesome. This one started off a little slow and really never hit its stride. Even though it's about a hit-man and deals with murder and mayhem it is not an action movie at all. I kept waiting for it to let loose and really grab me but it really never did. This is closer to an art house hit-man movie then the type I was looking for and I had a hard time staying interested. Overall, slow moving and hard to stay focused on the whole time. I give it a B-.",1359072000,2,984,4.130208333333333
5374835,5,B00A144O5W,one of my favorite movies! jack O'Connell deserves more credit for the movies he is in. I recommend Eden lake and Tower Block.,1379289600,,126,4.521739130434782
5374836,3,B00A144O5W,"But this movies was very uneven.  The premise is good, the acting is fine, but the directing needs work.  If you like Tim Roth, it's worth watching.  Otherwise, I'd skip it.",1374624000,,173,4.516129032258065
5374837,4,B00A144O5W,"What caught my attention with The Liability was the fact that it stars Tim Roth, who is in my opinion one of the most underrated actors. I'm not as familiar with the rest of the primarily UK-based cast, aside from actress Kierston Wareing, of the incredible Fish Tank (2009). Upon reading the plot, I was intrigued about this film even more: a young man named Adam (Jack O'Connell) joins aging hit man Roy (Roth) after Adam wrecks his stepfather's car and is forced to repay him by running errands. Adam is enthralled by Roy's profession, while Roy on the other hand is less expressive about his feelings or anything else for that matter at the start. The trip the two take winds up affecting them in more ways than they knew. The performances by the two leads is excellent, as is their chemistry. The cinematography was reminiscent of Drive at moments, with nice choice of music mixed with stylish imagery. This is the type of hit man flick that I enjoy - it's not so much heavy on the violence and action, but focuses more on the characters, their inner conflicts and circles around an interesting story that is fairly original for the genre. One thing I couldn't help but was that the film ended a bit abrupt with a few things that didn't quite add up. With a story like the one it had, I felt like it could have carried on more and I would have loved to see more. To top that off, Kierston Wareing is unjustly underused here. Those things aside, it's refreshing to see a hit man movie, or even a crime movie in general, doing something different.

5374838,1,B00A144O5W,I would like to finish the movie. Amazon left me hanging. It quit with 15 minutes to go. Could not reconnect with Amazon the rest the night. I resorted to watching Netflix. Even paused Netflix to try and reconnect with Amazon to no avail. Coming back the next day there is no resuming the 24 hr rental for this movie. This is not the first time. And on other occasions the video plays seemingly high def and then degrades to low def. I seems Amazon has a bandwidth problem. I think this is my last movie from Amazon.,1366588800,,516,4.275510204081633
5374839,5,B00A144O5W,"One of the better low-budget crime thrillers. As long as your expectations are not set too high, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how entertaining this film is. Starring Tim Roth, a great character actor, and some other actors I never heard of or saw before, but all the actors do a great job.  Peter Mullan and Jack O'Connell and Talulah Riley are all actors I hope to see much more of. The plot has some twists and turns that make for an interesting film.",1364601600,,468,4.379310344827586

5374843,4,B00A144O5W,"I have followed Tim Roths career for a long time now and have never been disappointed in anything he has appeared in. Though this may be the worst movie he has ever signed on to act in, it is still very much worth watching just to see Tim Roth exercise his acting ""chops""
Very much worth a rental. I enjoyed the movie but it could have been a lot better.",1362528000,,354,4.071428571428571
5374844,5,B00A144O5W,"Very enjoyable film, Tim Roth cut his own dialogue in places replacing it with looks only - he has such an expressive face.  Very enjoyable comedy thriller.  Recommend to anyone who likes films that are a little different.",1361664000,,222,4.815789473684211

8545954,4,B00A144O5W,"Another great british dark humor hit man movie. Jack O'Connell is a fast rising star in the Hollywood grind who is popping up everywhere all of a sudden. He's a perfect misfit in this comedy, Tim Roth is quietly funny with his new found partner in crime. A fun ride. Worth the watch.",1454803200,,283,4.3584905660377355
8545955,5,B00A144O5W,"Just saw this when I was looking up past purchases. I don't do reviews that go on & on regarding every character. This movie was suspenseful, & kept my attention the whole way through. Plus it has Tim Roth & Jack O'Connell. 2 of my favorite Brit actors.",1440460800,,253,4.291666666666667
8545956,5,B00A144O5W,"Yes, 5 stars for this.  Why, it is a reminder how foreign films can create these intricate twisty plots of ""what can happen to a person who is thrown into a bizarre situation but they really don't know it"". Other Examples:  Clay Pigeon, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  So this is not a spoiler alert, but I do ask this question:  In the last scene, the last twenty seconds, his decision:  is he stepping into 'yet another situation where he himself is becoming of the the ""details needing to be cleaned up"".  It's a thought of him continuing to be clueless.",1432080000,,562,4.46078431372549
8545957,2,B00A144O5W,"Disappointing. The first thing you need to know is that the plot is extremely obvious in the first 10 minutes. There are zero twist or surprises in this film. This is one of those movies where everyone knows what is about to happen except the person it is about to happen too. This is a British film and usually I don't have a problem with that but this is British hill country. Which means that there are very few people in this film. The acting was split, two of the primary characters did good and the other three were different levels bad. There is no scenery to enjoy and his is definitely not a family film mainly due to gory violent scenes and language. Tim Roth attempted the impossible but then accepted that he could save this film. If you like inept hit man films that are not comedies or spoofs and it comes on television for free then give it a try. Unfortunately this is another dvd that we will never play again.",1420675200,,927,4.333333333333333
8545958,3,B00A144O5W,"The Liability stars Tim Roth who does a fantastic job as an aging hit man working for a nasty boss who needs to get rid of his stepson. That's the set up. And the stepson is given the task of being a driver for Roth who is seemingly on a mission to take out some other lowlifes. Problem is, the stepson is completely useless. Roth bears this with wry indifference and sometimes wit that will provoke a few smirks. Otherwise, it's a slow show that unwinds with some predictability. Enter a female in search of justice and things improve markedly and in surprising ways. Yet, that stepson lacks any redeeming qualities, making the movie difficult to watch and move difficult to have any empathy for him, even when he becomes the victim. At any rate, things plod along until justice is served quite wickedly. If not for Tim Roth, this would have been straight to TV. You may find it interesting for the brooding portrayal by Roth and the excellent camera work in the bleak locations. Otherwise, maybe save your money.",1398211200,,1014,4.607734806629834
8545959,4,B00A144O5W,"When the Brits get their act together, a really decent movie results.  This is such a film.  Sex and violence here so not for young ones.",1397088000,,137,4.230769230769231
8545960,4,B00A144O5W,I thought it was a pretty original story.  It had twists that you didn't see coming and Tim Roth is a really good actor.,1385078400,,120,4.0
8545961,5,B00A144O5W,"Tim Roth is a master of the less-is-more portrayal of captivating diabolical dastardliness; pitch-perfect for his role in this sparkling gem of The Liability.

But who is this Jack O'Connell guy playing the sweet kid who really wants to be smart, sharp and on-the-ball in his new job but, gosh darn it, such a lofty goal is clearly above his skillset?  I'm convinced that it takes exceptional smarts to play dumb.  O'Connell's delicious timing and understated approach is a wonder to watch.

Where Roth normally works his magic alone, here Roth and O'Connell are a team and have superb chemistry.  I laughed hard several times at their banter, which also shines light on some very good writing.

One also has to mention Peter Mullan who always does bad so well, he's just fantastically frightening.

The Liability has a very small cast and viewers are rewarded with the palpable intimacy of such an approach.  The Liability is a quiet little feast.",1384646400,,948,4.88125
