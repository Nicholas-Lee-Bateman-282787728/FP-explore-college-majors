3688439,3,B001LOR34K,"I should have known when I saw that this DVD was released by Under Review that it would be just talk. I thought I read somewhere that the DVD contained concert performances, but I only found snippets of her singing.
True, the reviews were intelligent. But if I wanted to hear someone talking instead of Kate singing, I'd buy something else.
Also, it was difficult to hear what was being said in the tape recorded interview. The tape recording should have been cleaned up.
This DVD is good for one viewing only.",1275436800,10,510,4.554347826086956
3688440,5,B001LOR34K,Excellent dvd fast processing by amazon quick delivery very satisfied with Amazon. The dvd is an oldie but a goodie. Thoroughly enjoyed watching it.,1265846400,,148,5.208333333333333
3688441,4,B001LOR34K,"Full disclosure: I'm not a Kate Bush fan.  Her music is just not my type of music.  Except for Hounds of Love.  It's phenomenal.  If you're a major fan of her work, well versed in the trivia and minutiae of her career, this DVD may not have anything for you.  Its most notable flaw is a lack of participation from Bush herself.  But if you're a casual fan, or a fan of this particular album, you may enjoy the presentation.

I love the ""sausage-making"" aspects of music documentaries - all the creative decisions, the happy accidents, the fights that changed music history - and the DVD brings them out, track by track.  Even without Kate Bush herself present (there's a barely-audible tape interview in the extras) there's plenty of insight from the other musicians.",1238112000,24,767,4.6716417910447765
3688442,5,B001LOR34K,"I am always skeptical of DVD biographies and such.  Looking at the cover art I was even a bit apprehensive about picking this one up -- scared it would just be another unauthorized ho-hum affair without much new information or insight.

This is definitely worth the price however -- you won't find any gossip here -- instead you get informative interviews with musicians who played on the sessions -- as well as commentary from others who were there when it happened.

Hounds of Love is a great masterpiece that is worthy of discussion.  It was cool to watch this DVD and get a little peak into some of the movies/events/etc that may have inspired the songs.

The only thing I still don't agree with, and this has nothing to do with the DVD really, is that THE DREAMING was a failure!  In my own personal opinion DREAMING was just as good, if not better than HOUNDS OF LOVE.  That's a matter of personal taste though.

If you are a Kate fan and want to spend a chill afternoon learning a bit more about an album we already love to death, pick this up.",1236643200,53,1051,4.409326424870466
