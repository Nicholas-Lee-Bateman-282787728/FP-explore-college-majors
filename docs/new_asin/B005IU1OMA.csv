4709765,5,B005IU1OMA,"Simply amazing and jaw-dropping, awesome snowboarding and amazing cinemtography. After watching this film and even the previous Travis Rice film. You will no longer have the desire to just watch any old snowboarding film. This film just simply blows other snowboarding films out of the water. Granted it's sponsored by RedBull who we all know has money to burn. But even so it's a must see and must have in your collection of Snowboarding Films.",1315785600,,445,4.946666666666666
4709766,5,B005IU1OMA,"I've been snowboarding for a long time, and I've seen my fair share of snowboard videos.  I've NEVER seen a video of this caliber.  The cinematography is incredible, the soundtrack goes along perfectly, and the commentating is great.

Even if you aren't an avid snowboarder you should check this film out.  I've had at least 3 people watch it with me who weren't riders and they were stunned.

Pros:

Everything

Cons:

Wish it was longer.  I honestly could've watched this film if it was 4 hours long.  It was that good.",1315785600,,521,4.626373626373627
4709767,5,B005IU1OMA,"This film got a lot of people excited ahead of its release just looking at its trailers, and it meets those high expectations. There are a few nods to traditional documentary film-making here and there (a few voiceovers, a few shots of the crew goofing around on bad weather days), but the main focus is on amazingly skillful snowboarding in settings that are mostly stunning. The level of skill on display at every level is breathtaking: the snowboarders, trail builders, pilots, camera crew, editors, and sound people have made a thing of beauty.

I watched this movie with my two young boys, and their reactions to both the landscape and the snowboarding were loud and hilarious. So many exclamations of ""WOW!"" (You'd better not mind a few people swearing if you plan to watch with your kids, mind you.)

I could go on, but here's the bottom line: even if you don't care about snowboarding or the mountains, this movie is a visual and aural feast of rare quality that will not fail to impress you.",1315612800,29,1000,4.676136363636363
4709768,5,B005IU1OMA,"This film is by far the most transfixing snowboarding experience I have ever seen.

The literal meaning of words like epic, amazing & awesome have been overused describing everyday occurrences, dumbing them down to the point that they will not adequately describe what is captured in this film.

It literally inspires awe and amazes the eyes and ears.

The camera work, soundtrack and editing are flat out ridiculous.

Seeing is believing, don't take my word for it.

Enjoy the ride.",1315440000,54,483,4.9875
4709769,5,B005IU1OMA,"Is it a Red Bull promo...yes.  Is it a shameless exhibition of testosterone (and other) fueled adventure....yes.  Is it the most awesome thing I've seen/heard on my Goldenear Triton I  4k Dolby Atmos theater system (insert Time the tool man Taylor grunt)...oh he!! yeah!  Yes, I snowboard...not anything like this...but I don't think you have to have even tried it to appreciate the magnitude of what is displayed.  Well done.",1498262400,,426,5.0285714285714285

Filming this must have been a logistical nightmare. They brought high end camera's to the furthest ends of the earth. These aren't on ski resorts, with groomed terrain, or even well traveled heliski drop zones. There has never been a snowboarding film that better documents humans connection with natural snow terrain. The Film also documents the struggles of dealing with nature in its prime, and also not so prime conditions. Every time I see this film I'm inspired to go further out into the backcountry, and experience what nature throws at me.",1407024000,,695,4.898305084745763

Bonus feature: includes a lengthy account of flying into Canada, where weather kept them from riding. At all. Good thing they put all the footage of that trip into the film because it was really exciting!

Watch some hick from Jackson chop down a real tree with shotgun blasts!

Marvel at the kicker they build and ride without helmets (EXTREME!!!) until someone busts SICK air and LITERALLY CRACKS HIS HEAD OPEN!

I think if you want to watch a snowboarding movie!!1 Start right here and never look back!!

The best part I liked about the movie is that unlike some movies I have watched were the preference is to the snowboarders (who are in the movie) personal habits, feelings etc. Not this one. This movie is about snowboarding with a few inputs here and there from the athletes.

The blu ray picture is incredible, it really brings the mountains to life. The audio is mixed masterfully as well, even on my very modest 3.1 setup, it sounded amazing.

I am all for watching some of the most beautiful cinematography ever shot of the human spirit conquering their fears and going literally where no man has gone before.  However, I think the film would have been better served by having the riders talk about themselves a little more in order for the audience to have a connection with them and their brilliant endeavors.  At the end it comes out like, ""Red Bull gave us a lot of money. Let's film getting the best shots as fast as we can.  Screw building up our riders.

4709961,1,B005IU1OMA,"One star for the riding, which was great. But great riding just isn't enough any more. We've all seen a lot of great riding. I was disappointed with this film mainly because of the extensive use of slo-mo shots of helicopters. It seems that the film makers were short on actual snowboarding footage, and used nearly as much B-roll as A-tape. A narrative arc would have helped viewers enjoy the rare but fantastic bits of snowboarding. Many of us in the snowboarding community were excited when Jeremy Jones swore off helicopters a few years ago and vowed to learn how to mountaineer. I was hoping that would spark a movement. This film is a huge remission from that sentiment. The carbon footprint must have been epic. Using three helicopters in some shoots and cruising around for days on extremely dirty snowmobiles does not set a good example and really makes those of us that care about nature disgusted. I've read some reviews that say if you like nature you will like this film. I offer the opposite: if you like nature you should hate this film. Please just learn how to climb already and get to the summit on your own steam. Otherwise you are just wasting resources and really don't deserve to be in the mountains. I also have to give negative points for the dialogue, which was unintentionally funny at times and nauseatingly trite throughout. Basically we have a collection of slo-mo helicopters taking off and some sweet snowboarding action interspersed. Not bad, but not nearly what I was expecting from this over-hyped group of riders. I also would have appreciated some new talent in the film. How about some women? Maybe if the crew didn't have such a helicopter fetish they could find some ladies to ride with! There are many riders out there that are also good mountaineers. The riders in this film come across as bumbling idiots in the mountains. They should learn how to climb mountains or else go back to the park. This is the same snowboarding film we've seen a thousand times but with more slo-mo shots of helicopters. I was uninspired and even a little angry. The ending was particularly blah; I guess that's what happens when you stumble through 90 minutes of self-obsessed B-roll and never have a plot. I hope this is the low point for snowboarding films and that in the future we can watch a film that uses a $2 million dollar budget to create something worth watching. Is it asking too much for a film that advances the sport rather than showing off toys, offering nothing new, and reinforcing all the negative stereotypes?",1329177600,5,2550,4.706935123042506

4709968,5,B005IU1OMA,"""The Art of Flight"" Represents State-of-the-Art Blu-ray

(Interview with Joel silver by Robert Archer CE Pro Magazine, January 24, 2012)

It's amazing how driven audio and video enthusiasts are to find the next great audiophile recording or reference-level video release.

Joel Silver is president and founder of the Imaging Science Foundation (ISF), and a massive home theater enthusiast. So it's not surprising when he says that custom installers have to know about a specific video because its quality is so good.

Silver's latest video recommendation is The Art of Flight, and according to the industry's leading video authority, this Blu-ray is the newest ISF reference disc for sound and picture quality in a home video release.

The Art of Flight is a documentary from Red Bull Media House and Brain Farm Digital Cinema that follows the exploits of extreme snowboarders Travis Rice and his friends as they tackle some of the most mountainous terrain in the world.

Silver notes that the video was edited in post production using Dolby Laboratories' PRM-4200 Professional Reference Monitor that employs the company's Dual-Modulation Display Technology. He adds that it was released with a dynamic Dolby TrueHD 7.1 soundtrack.

Silver says that Dolby's new display and companion display technology is truly state-of-the-art, and that because of the monitor's capabilities the post-production team was able to create one of the best-looking Blu-ray videos ever released. ""Dolby flexed its muscle with this disc,"" he says. ""Dolby used the disc at CES [International Consumer Electronics Show] and I'm using it at my house. Right now if you visit me, you'll get a glass of wine and this video on my screen.""

Narrowing down his choices of what scenes he suggests to use as demo content was not easy. Silver points out that everything about the video is good, but he mentions the fourth chapter is a good place to start. ""Chapter four has a chopper and a plane that are dropping the extreme snowboarders onto a mountain peak,"" he explains. ""At this point, make sure you have enough light output on your video and a good audio system that can handle low-end content. It is a rare system that can handle these elements. Look at the contrast and listen to the sound ... the color saturation.""

Emphatically, Silver summarizes The Art of Flight by saying, ""there isn't a bad part on this disc. This is a 7.1 production done on a state-of-the-art monitor with great camera work ... this disc has it all. I don't know of any Blu-ray discs that look this good; this is what Blu-ray discs are supposed to look and sound like.

""Dealers have to have this disc, I'm not even a snowboarder, but it makes me want to jump on a snowboard.""",1327536000,,2726,4.919389978213507

If it wasn't for the disappointment (and maybe that's my fault), I'd give it three stars.  There was more filler than action, some filler was way out of context (seemed like I was watching another kind of thrill movie), the mix volumes made the dialog too mute and music too grandiose and annoying, the team didn't work well, never seemed to gel, fighting, making mistakes, etc.  I admit that it was heartening to see them work through their disagreements, and interesting to see the heli ice up and get stuck on a ridge - kudos to all of them for saving that situation and surviving.  This movie would've been better if made as a documentary than presented as a presumed epic ski/board movie to thrill and entertain (for that, I really enjoyed Attack of La Nina).",1325462400,,867,4.503184713375796

I bought this movie mainly for my son who is an avid snowboarder, but even I can appreciate the skill of the guys involved - just phenomenal! This is a doco at heart, so the repetition in action can be forgiven and anyway, there is somethng very contagious about young people completely immersed in the passion for a sport like this. - Those who frequent the slopes will just love this movie.  Personally, I'm a bit more into the technicalities of the movie making and am intrigued at the variety of shots captured in this work ... every angle covered it seems, and in startling clarity and ultra vivid colour. From a tech point of view, I find the editing generally excellent, with perhaps a tad overemphasis on those amazing slow motion bits which appear frequently, but again, in rock solid smoothness and clarity which reminds one that this is an extreme hi-tech production as well! The sound is also perhaps a tad ""overbaked"" here and there with huge LF Effects - even the lighting of a gas stove ring has to be accompanied by thunderous roar from the sub as the flame springs forth!  These are young editors who revel in the facility to blow everyones socks off with an armoury of precision digital video and audio techniques!
Enough said. If you love snowboarding, buy this movie!  And if you love mountain scenery in awesome colour and clarity ... buy this movie.  You will not be dissapointed.

It just didn't quite measure up to Travis and company's last one. But that is an unfair comparison. I doubt any movie will ever be as good as TITA. This is a close second. Travis kills it as usual. And the rest of the crew are no slouch.

Travis Rice is my favorite snowboarder in the world, but his name has been tarnished by this release.

I understand there are time and funding constraints, but why not take an extra season and actually capture some snowboarding footage?

Instead we get, ""Welcome to Country A. Oh damn, we can't ride here. Welcome to Country B. Oh damn, can't ride here either. Welcome back to Country A. One run? Let's do it.""

The Art of Flight is still epic in its own though. The only thing I didn't like is how much failed locations they had although this does give you the perspective of what they have to go through to get those shots in those amazing locations. Its not always going to be top notch conditions. If you ride you know what thats like. That aside the cinematography is amazing. So much detail. The lengths they go through to ride the best places in the word just shows how much dedication this crew has. I first watched this on Zune on Xbox, after seeing it I just had to have it.

Brain Farm is the at the top of their game, and even when the conditions totally hose them over, they manage to make something as good as Art of Flight, which is a testament to their talent.  I've probably watched Thats it Thats all at least 20 times.  When you put the two side by side, TAOF pales.  This is a movie made by adults (compared to TITA which was made by some extremely talented kids).  The voice narration felt forced, and only some of the music hit as hard as the first movie.  The little things, like showing how a snowboard was made, and the guy driving a snowmobile over a lake really added to the movie.  In this one, they shoot down trees with a shotgun and blow stuff up.  I get it, they're thrill seekers, but killing a tree like that seemed a bit crass.  Them knocking dead parts of a tree when they hit jumps is part of their craft, I guess?  However between them nearly dying, and everyone telling them they were insane, and the tension when the heli had to shut down on top of a mountain, this movie felt dark.

Anyway, what happened to the M83 track from the trailer?  Don't get me wrong, I like Deadmau5, saw him in concert even, but Fire Shall Devour them is better than any of the tracks on the soundtrack.

What is frustrating is the fact that Jackson had probably their biggest snow year ever, I think.  They could have spent most of the time there doing tree runs, tricks, and runs there.  I would have been happy.  Jackson Hole is the greatest ski resort on the face of the earth.  Watching them strike out three times (Chile, Patagonia, Canada) for good conditions was really deflating.  More like ""The art of getting your heart broken"".  I still love Brain Farm and Travis Rice and crew, I just didn't like this as much as TITA, which had more passion, and unbridled joy for snow boarding throughout the movie.

As soon as you start thinking about the next snowboarding scene it there already.

The only movies that are even close to the same category are ""That's it that's all"" and ""Picture This""

Thank you Travis Rice and Red Bull, keep doing what you're doing.",1316044800,,717,4.511627906976744
4709998,5,B005IU1OMA,"If you're looking for a non-stop heart pumping thriller with punk rock blaring in the background to get you stoked before your pre-run, this might not necessarily be for you. The Art of Flight is an amazing film that documents snowboarding in a unique perspective that many don't get to see. With its ambient and electric indie soundtrack, narrative voice-overs expressing the thoughts and emotion of riders, and breath taking HD views panning across your flatscreen in Slow-Mo, The Art of Flight is an artistic ballet of adrenaline that will capture many!",1316044800,,556,5.054347826086956

8475006,4,B005IU1OMA,"The riding in this movie is insane... Travis Rice is in his prime, and that is to say this is some of the best riding ever put on film.  The production value is phenomenal, the cinematography is at times awe inspiring.  The quality of the footage is 2nd to none overall.

That said... whoever picked the soundtrack... good lord.  Its awful.  So needless to say this gets played on mute with some quality tunes pumped into the sound system... problem solved.",1519603200,,457,4.592592592592593
