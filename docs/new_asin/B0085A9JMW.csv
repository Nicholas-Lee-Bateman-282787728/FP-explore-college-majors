5132332,5,B0085A9JMW,Robert Hamer (director and co-screenwriter) and Gore Vidal (screenwriter) combined their writing skills with the exquisite artistry of Daphne Du Maurier as Alec Guinness and a solid supporting cast lent their peculiar talent to incarnate the script. What was produced had been a disciplined rendering of the du Maurier novel. A little more than a half century ago accolades were tossed and reviews hailed a boffo production. All that could be said to praise this ninety-one minutes of entertainment luxury have been said. Hamer and Vidal found a way to insert the rich writing of du Maurier into to script without overly narrating it. Guinness is the virtuoso of deadpan confusion as he tries to work out the riddle in which he is cast. Cheap at any price! Own this movie and watch it from time to time. It helps to remind oneself of what real artistry is.,1386201600,5,856,4.79054054054054
5132333,5,B0085A9JMW,"This is a movie I have been wanting to see for YEARS!!  First - I think everyone should read the book by Daphne Du Maurier to get more details as to the plot - intricate and spell-binding.

Alec Guinness of course is a marvelous actor and takes you right into the character.",1379980800,,274,4.25
5132334,4,B0085A9JMW,"Based on the Daphne du Maurier novel, THE SCAPEGOAT is a thriller in which Alec Guinness plays two roles - one innocent, the other sinful.  The sinful character forces the innocent to assume his way of life: to cope with several situations not of his own making; a family without resources; a business on the point of collapse; a wife half-mad with anguish; a daughter requiring constant attention; and a lover needing solace every Wednesday afternoon.  The innocent does a creditable job - so creditable, in fact, that he does not want to abandon the role once the sinner returns.  This leads to a satisfying ending in which right prevails.  Gore Vidal's adaptation - reworked by director Robert Hamer - emphasizes the importance of staying true to one's feelings, however difficult that might be.  Guinness enjoys himself in a dual role (recalling his virtuoso performance in KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS, also directed by Hamer), and receives admirable support from Pamela Brown, Irene Worth and Bette Davis as his cantankerous mother.",1361750400,11,1034,5.0588235294117645
5132335,4,B0085A9JMW,"Two men meet in a bar in northern France, a vacationing British schoolteacher with a dull life and a glamorous French count whose wealthy lifestyle is fraught with excitement. The catch: these two very different men look exactly alike (Alec Guiness plays both parts). They get drunk together, and the next morning, the schoolteacher wakes in his hotel room to find that the count has vanished--after carefully switching identities with him. The lonely Brit is now the fabulous Comte de Gue! He goes to the count's chateau, hoping to correct the mistake and get on with his vacation, and that's where the real mystery begins...

Daphne du Maurier is one of my favorite authors, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Scapegoat/dp/081221725X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Scapegoat</a>&nbsp;is one of my favorite books. I knew there was a film version of it, but I'd never been able to see it. It doesn't show up on TV a lot, and there wasn't a recorded version I could find until now. Warner Home Video has a print-on-demand DVD-R version of this rare 1958 film, and it's very interesting. Gore Vidal adapted du Maurier's bestseller, with a final screenplay and direction by Robert Hamer. It's a good film version of the novel, although much of the original plot has been altered and streamlined, mainly the ending. Still, Guiness is terrific in two very different roles, and the excellent supporting cast includes Bette Davis (as the count's bedridden mother), Irene Worth, and Pamela Brown. If you're a fan of the book, or even if you're just curious about this little-known Alec Guiness film, you'll want to check it out. Recommended.",1358726400,6,1681,5.295880149812734
5132336,5,B0085A9JMW,"I read this Daphne du Maurier book several years ago, and it was a thrilling read. Du Maurier has written several gems in the thriller (albeit slow thriller) genre, and some have been made into masterpiece movies (Rebecca). Since reading ""The Scapegoat"" those years ago, I was very curious about the movie, and Warner Archive finally gave me the opportunity. While not a masterpiece, I was surprised at the quality of this work, and I would watch this again.

The basic plot is that a French count (with a life full of intrigue) discovers an English professor (with a life full of boredom) that looks EXACTLY like him. Next thing you know, the boring life of the professor is not so boring anymore, and he ultimately finds he is being used. (Ok, I realize this is a poor plot description, but I really don't know how to tell you enough of the story without telling you too much!)

Alec Guinness does a great job in his dual roles, and the supporting actors are just fine. Bette Davis is excellent (as always). All in all, this movie was the perfect length, has good acting, and the suspense is good enough to be a minor Hitchcock work. Call me a fan!",1356912000,5,1150,4.497607655502392
5132337,5,B0085A9JMW,"I purchased this particular movie from Amazon so that I could finish watching it!  It had been on tv but the film was damaged and I wasn't able to hear the last part of it.  I was intrigued by the plot and some of the actors.  Alec Guinness was fantastic in this role
as well as anything else that he starred in.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about
Bette Davis.  She was dreadful as always.  The sound on this DVD was excellent and I
had no problem with hearing any of the lines or dialogue.  It was an excellent buy for the money and I look forward to dealing with Amazon in the future.",1353542400,,594,4.113043478260869
5132338,4,B0085A9JMW,"The mistaken-identity fulcrum is one of the oldest plot devices around, used and abused in literature and film repeatedly, sometimes effectively ('The Prince and the Pauper,' 'The Man in the Iron Mask,' 'The Prisoner of Zenda'), most often not (insert any of a thousand other examples here). But if in 2012 your already overtaxed sense of cinematic implausiblity can bear just one more assault, 1959's 'The Scapegoat,' based on the Daphne Du Maurier novel, I think will reward your indulgence.  Half of the reason for this is that the story and characters have sufficient depth to push the tired twin trope well away from the foreground, where it doesn't nag constantly at your suspension of disbelief; the better half of the reason are the riveting performances, by both leading (Alec Guinness) and supporting (a roster of top-notch British actors, plus Bette Davis) cast, which guide you through this darkly humorous, surrealistic murder-mystery with equal parts fun and fascination.  The Warner Archive release, unfortunately, is a low-budget DVD-R burned from a reasonably good unremastered b&w source print with cut-rate package design and a theatrical trailer as its lone bonus feature, but with a film of this stature and rarity, those technical demerits are a few tears in the ocean.  Movie earns 4-plus stars, presentation/price 3ish stars.",1347926400,22,1349,5.265116279069767

5132343,5,B0085A9JMW,"This is one of those movies rarely seen on t.v.  It is intriguing in its premise.  I think many people would switch places with their look-a-like if given the opportunity because, let's face it, we all think the grass is greener over the septic tank.  The only off note for me is the casting of Bette Davis.  She seems to be a parody of herself from one of her worst movie roles.  Alec Guinness however is thoughtful and engaging and you find yourself truly caring about the outcome.  A good movie.",1417305600,,498,4.417582417582418
5132344,5,B0085A9JMW,"Brilliant film. Alec guinness is pure genius. Great British film making, great drama with a twist. It has a delicious element of surrealism to it. it has a balancing act of both cruelty and compassion. I quite recently saw this film in an Art House Cinema and knew I had to own it and saver it's myriad nuances. Enjoy!",1413072000,,318,4.406779661016949
5132345,5,B0085A9JMW,"Love the pacing of this film!  I had forgotten how much a good post-WWII era film could ""get away with"" in dialogue and a long look between a man and a woman across a crowded room.  Daphne de Maurier was a uniquely gifted writer who could actually write and think like her male protagonists, but the sultryness AND innocence of women is evident, too.  The plot is a stretch, I admit, but once the premise is established, aw, go on!  Embrace it.  Sit back and enjoy!  Best watched with companions as after you watch this film, you open that second bottle of wine or put on another pot of coffee and engage in a really good chat about it.",1410048000,,636,4.302521008403361
5132346,4,B0085A9JMW,"It's amazing that such a good film eventually came out of Ms. Du Maurier's perverse and convoluted novel. The novelist herself went into a rage over the screenplay, and many changes were made. You may notice in the trailer that Blanche (Pamela Brown) speaks of a plot element that does not appear in the movie. Also, the voiceover by Alec Guinness was added after the film was made, and I think it contributes greatly to the film's power, putting us firmly on the side of sanity.

""Perhaps a man has to be empty before he can be used?"" Sir Alec (as John Barratt) muses, in his loneliness at the beginning of the film.. ""Used for what? God knows.""

God does indeed know, and the movie turns out to be a Christian fable, which is not how it was advertised, and which probably put off many movie-goers who wanted it to be something else. The whole film depends for its interest on perpetual suspense. Every time I watch the film I wonder anew how John Barratt will manage to answer the incessant questions thrown at him by members of ""his"" household, and I marvel at the skill he shows in giving compassionate and usually truthful answers. I also wonder which members of the household realize John Barratt is not Jacques de Gue. We know the dog is not fooled, nor is Jaques' mistress, but I think Marie-Leon and de Gue's valet, Gaston, are also aware. See what you think!

The acting is almost uniformly splendid, with special Ancient Bookworm Honors going to Geoffrey Keen's touching performance as the loyal Gaston. However--and it's a big ""however""--Sir Alec wrote in his diary that ""she [Bette Davis] was not the artist I had expected. She entirely missed the character of the old Countess, which could have been theatrically effective, and only wanted to be extravagantly over-dressed and surrounded, quite ridiculously, with flowers.""

I've given ""The Scapegoat"" four instead of five stars because of Ms. Davis performance. She has a pivotal role, and her ranting throws the whole film out of balance. Mercifully, some of her shrieks are covered with voice-over, but not enough to prevent John Barratt from saying tersely, ""This is a madhouse!""",1406851200,,2147,4.794594594594595

8525314,2,B0085A9JMW,"This came with a notice that it is ""an On Demand manufactured film made by the studio."" How the mighty have fallen.

It is true desecration. I had seen it on Youtube, but when it was pay-walled, I decided to buy a disk, not pay for each view. Bad choice. The original was in a 4:3 aspect ratio but the DVD is modifies it to 16:9  not just by clipping the originals top and bottom, but by expanding the whole image. Not only are the top of actors heads chopped off, they are scarcely in the picture at all most of the time. Too much takes place off screen! Terrible job. I wish I had known.

Good acting, directing, etc., mitigates the greed, opportunism, etc. otherwise I would have rated it a 1.",1503100800,,696,4.2180451127819545
8525315,2,B0085A9JMW,"The premise is contrived to begin with: a British professor vacationing in Paris happens to meet a French count who looks and sounds just like him. They converse in a bar, and the professor admits having a dull and empty life while the count has had a very full life. The count tricks the professor into staying at a hotel room, and in the morning, the count disappears, leaving the professor to be mistaken for the count. The professor tries to convince the count's family and associates that he is not really the count, but nobody believes him, and he is forced to play the count's role, dealing with his family, the glass foundry the count owns, and the counts friends and mistresses. The professor's behavior and attitudes differ than that of the real count, but only one of the mistresses puts two and two together.

Akin to Monty Python, the movie is played straight, and the performers all play their parts well. The movie would undoubtedly have come crashing down if it weren't for that. The movie is in fact based on a novel by Daphne DuMarier, whose plot is quite more complicated.",1502755200,,1091,4.623711340206185

was hooked in the first 15 minutes. The movie has a great plot and has many twist in the story. I agree Davis is a waste in the movie and
is not very good or convincing in her part. Seems she's not really into the role at all. The ending was not surprising and I found kind of
lame just to have him go back to the girlfriend. What about the family? what about the daughter? did he tell her and them what happened?
did the police find the real man dead? if so were there not questions? the ending left too many questions. but it's still a good mystery movie.",1460246400,,692,4.0583941605839415
