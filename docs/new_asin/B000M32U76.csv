8481270,1,B000M32U76,"I bought this vacabulary DVD thinking that my kids can take it on the road and listen to it now and then. But guess what, this thing doesn't have sound. All it does is to show a word and then the explanation. It doesn't read the word, and doesn't give sample sentences. And it doesn't even work properly when played with my PC's. It would show a word for a long duration, and then flash through the explanation so fast that it's impossible to read.  There is not a way to control the tempo of the displays. Not only it lacks multimedia and user control features, it simply did not work properly for me.",1293926400,3,602,4.280701754385965
