3556512,4,B001EOQDSY,I got this DVD for my oldest daughter for Christmas.  She really loves most of the songs on this and was happy with this gift. I thought there wasn't much to the live performance and the song list was short IMO. But this was cheap and she was happy with it so that is all that matters.,1357516800,,285,4.0
3556513,5,B001EOQDSY,"i love 3dg and this cd shows their concert in detroit. adam is full of energy as usual. it also has an acoustic version of alice in chains ""here comes the rooster"" sorry for giving it away. but anyway this cd is awesome they also do a long version of ""home"" just like they do at their concerts like when i seen them at uproar. they sang lose yourself by eminem. but i won't tell you what song they sing with home so it will be a surprise. i don't want to give the whole movie away. i watch this all the time and catch myself singing along with Adam Gontier. Such a great band. this is an awesome video full of upbeat and great music. worth buying for sure.",1356912000,,656,4.053846153846154
3556514,5,B001EOQDSY,"This was an absolute awesome DVD.  The crowd was hyped the entire time and Three Days Grace rocked out!  This DVD had a great mix of songs from One X and the first Three Days Grace CD's.  All of my favorite songs like Pain, Riot, Just Like You, and I hate Everything About You.  It felt like I was part of the crowd.  TDG is my favorite band and will be forever!",1309392000,,362,3.9722222222222223
3556515,2,B001EOQDSY,"Ok, maybe I'm old fashioned, but I think all the interviews should be on their own separate title track and not in-between each song.  The sound mix was a bit muddy also.  Maybe we should concentrate on a better quality production and a little less on just being pissed off and hateful.",1309392000,,286,4.480769230769231
3556516,4,B001EOQDSY,"I thought this was a pretty cool DVD. You got to see and learn a little bit about TDG and get a little dose of what life is like on the road. I didn't think it sounded as absolutely great as it could of, but it sill did sound pretty good.
I would recommend this DVD regardless and I hope if you do get it that you will enjoy it!",1281657600,2,328,3.7
3556517,5,B001EOQDSY,"I was at this show on March 21st 2008 at the Palce when Three Days Grace taped this.  I thought they were great and the crowd was great as well.  The pit was rockin' especially during Riot.  The whole night was great as well with Seether and Breaking Benjamin doing great sets.  Take it from me, the show was great so get this DVD if you're a Three Days Grace fan.  You'll love it!",1259280000,3,381,4.094594594594595
3556518,5,B001EOQDSY,"Three Days Grace is the best band live! Their music is awesome!!! They saved my life, and I thank them for that. I love them so much!",1255564800,,133,3.962962962962963
3556519,4,B001EOQDSY,"I enjoyed this DVD quite a bit. It was great getting to know the band, but I thought these inserts interrupted the flow of the concert. I would've preferred there be a separate section on the dvd for this. Good selection of songs on the concert itself. They certainly generate a lot of energy from their fans, which made it all the more worth while.",1232668800,3,349,4.384615384615385

8299100,5,B001EOQDSY,"Absolutely fantastic. If you're a Three Days Grace fan, you must have this. It's at a great time for them, right after One X.  Another reason it's a must have is that Adam Gontier is no longer with the band.  He will be sorely missed.",1409616000,,234,4.177777777777778
