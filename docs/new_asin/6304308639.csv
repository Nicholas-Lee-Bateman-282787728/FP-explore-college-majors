842317,5,6304308639,"I recommend this film.  It has a great cast Esther Williams, Van Johnson and the very funny and talented Lucille Ball.  It's also a well worth seeing film of hers, and has one of the better story lines.  It's romantic funny and really good fun to watch.",1031097600,8,253,4.340425531914893
842318,4,6304308639,"A fairly entertaining musical with a fun-filled cast. Esther Williams plays the beautiful rich playgirl who brings a massive lawsuit down on the head of newspaperman Keenan Wynn, who had printed an unflattering article about her lavish, irresponsible lifestyle.  In order to win the case, Wynn hires suave Johnson (a former employee with the same newspaper) to win over Williams so she will drop the charges.  Naturally, everything goes haywire... While this film can't hold a candle to original 1936 film LIBELED LADY, of which this is a re-make, it gave Lucille Ball one of her best comedy showcases in the movies in her role as Gladys Benton. The colour photography is quite good and the songs are amusing if a bit corny.",1030579200,18,724,4.878048780487805
842319,5,6304308639,"Lucy was absolutely spectacular in this movie! Even though her character was a stupid, gullible one, she played it wonderfully. I feel bad saying that, but it was her character, not her, and it shows how versatile she was  and how many characters she could portray. Lucille Ball was born to be in  Technicolor! She looks radiant with her flaming red hair, intense blue  eyes, and her four corner, blood red mouth. She looks so beautiful in this  movie. She and Van Johnson have such great chemistry together. This movie  gave us a peek at her comic ability and what was in store for us in the  years to come, but it also showed that Lucy was not limited to comedy. It's  a wonder why MGM didn't see her talent and cast her in A movies. This is a  great movie and Lucy is even better!",958953600,12,783,4.315068493150685

842470,2,6304308639,"this may be in color but the Black & white version is better. I have seen Lucille Ball in her T.V. series that she did later in life & she exhibited alot of talent for comedy. Here, as the rather dim girlfriend, she is really badly cast. It almost seems as if she's missing her lines, or coming in at the wrong time. She is the weakest cast member, which is saying alot since Esther Williams' talent is for swimming~",1417996800,,416,4.2125

842474,5,6304308639,The story was more slapstick but I needed laughs rather than tears. The costumes were so beautiful! Music and dancing impressive.,1372032000,,129,5.190476190476191

842476,3,6304308639,"There is really only one reason to see this otherwise mediocre film, and that is Lucille Ball. With her vivid coloring (flaming red hair, bright blue eyes, and a picture perfect, peaches and cream complexion), she is simply stunning. With a va-va-voom figure to go with her vibrant looks, she is truly a peacock among the pigeons.

The story is a simple one and a remake of an earlier, better film, ""Libeled Lady"". When a society woman (Ethel Williams) sues a newspaper for millions in a libel suit, the newspaper fights back, by hiring a playboy type (Van Johnson) to arrange for her to be caught in a compromising position. As expected, the playboy and the society dame fall for each other.

Keenan Wynn is especially good as the one who hires the playboy, and then embroils his own fianc&eacute;e, a showgirl (Lucille Ball), in the plot. Still, other than Lucille Ball's stunning good looks, there is nothing to elevate this film out of the ordinary. Still, fans of Ms. Ball will get a rush just from seeing her on the big screen.",1364601600,,1033,4.639344262295082
842477,4,6304308639,"""Easy to Wed"" is a remake of one of the great comedies of the 1930s, ""Libeled Lady,"" with Jean Harlow, William Powell, Myrna Loy, and Spencer Tracy.  I like ""Easy to Wed,"" but for a real treat see the original.

However, there is something special in ""Easy to Wed"" missing from the original.  It is Ethel Smith, in one of her rare film appearances.  Ethel Smith is the greatest Hammond pop organist of all time.  Her interpretation of ""Bonecu de Pixe"" in the film takes the Hammond organ, then scarcely out of its infancy, far beyond what anyone else has ever elicited from that instrument.  Smith's mastery of the organ, the sheer energy and physicality of her performance, is a stunning tour de force.  No keyboard artist, living or dead, ever achieved her unique style.  The closest comparison would be Carmen Miranda, had Carmen Miranda been an organist.

Regardless of whether one likes this film or not, one cannot help but be in thrall to Smith's joie de vivre.",1292889600,,968,4.680473372781065
