The popularion of Muslims in Palestine at that time was 400,000 Muslims, 60,000 Chrisitans and just 20,000 Jews and they all lived together relatively peacefully for centuries. Trouble began when the European and Russian Jews began to emigrate to Palestine in large numbers and who had no interest in learning the language, customs or in becoming Ottoman citizens.

Let's face it, the history books have been far more slanted towards blaming Muslims and portraying the Jews as innocent victims which is far from true. It is always important to see the Big Picture on any issue otherwise your opinions won't be well formed. They will be only half baked if you will and what good is a cake that is half baked?

6891267,2,B00R041BMK,"I was disappointed.  I believed the production value was excellent but it struck me as a video essay describing the Zionist as the root cause of the historic and current conflict.  It also, and I think this is bad history, seemed to paint a picture of the crumbling Ottoman Empire as one in which everyone got along well until the European Jews arrived.  I am not a Jew but I found it offense in that regard.  Excellent production values but solid story telling weakened by, well, thinly disguised bigotry.",1435795200,7,506,4.651685393258427
6891268,2,B00R041BMK,It's an interesting documentary that is very well put together but it feels like the quotes and reenactments are sort of cherry picked in order to show a particular vision of the origins of the Arab Israeli conflict.  Nothing is necessarily faked but you definitely feel a certain opinion being expressed that the ultimate cause of the conflict was Zionism which in turn caused Arab Nationalism.  Particularly it seemed to take a very negative view of the land sales to Jews by Arabs but I don't feel like it really explained enough about the transactions and just took the view they were somewhat devious.  Overall I'm not sure this really shed any new light for me on the conflict other than hearing some first hand opinions but I feel like the the context was somewhat lost in a lot of these quotes.  I left with more questions than answers.,1435622400,15,844,4.644295302013423

6891294,5,B00R041BMK,"This is a very welcome documentary from an honest Jewish director, offering a fresh perspective grounded in historical facts rather than 'stupid theology' and other myths that do not guide us into the foundational biblical call to Justice and Reconciliation but rather into perpetual conflict and worse. I viewed this new documentary first on our local Seattle area PBS station, KCTS Channel 9, immediately following a welcome repeat-showing of the one hour long Rick Steves holy land program.  The two programs fit very well together, as Steves ever so gently introduces the audience to some of today's 'realities' in the lives of Israeli Jews and their Palestinian Christian and Muslim neighbors -- in both Israel 'proper' and in ""the West Bank"" -- and then ""1913:Seeds of Conflict"" provides some essential historical background to how we arrived in a situation where one would be hard-pressed to discern anything but 'One State' since in fact Israel ultimately controls everything through its combined military, police, political and economic powers.  OF COURSE it is a myth that: ""Arabs and Jews have been 'fighting forever' -- it has to be, according to the Bible!"" The so-called ""Christian Zionists"" repeat this myth over and over BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT TRUE.  In fact like all 'neighbors' Arabs and Jews have enjoyed ups and downs in their relationships through the centuries, but that includes many positives -- something the likes of John Hagee and his CUFI associates would have you ignore as they try to whip up hatred so that they can try to steer history according to their skewed (and heretical) interpretations of biblical texts.  As ""1913"" illustrates, a much bigger role needs to be attributed to the ascendant ""Nationalism"" of the 19th and 20th centuries, combined with insincere or even false promises from colonial powers like Great Britain, the USA and others, coupled with the heretical ""dispensational"" theology propounded by the likes of J.N Darby and his cronies up 'til today like John Hagee, Hal Lindsey, etc.  After viewing ""1913:Seeds of Conflict"" I bought two copies on DVD and these will be used here in our Puget Sound region as part of a continuing educational effort to restore and uphold the 'gospel' of justice and reconciliation. I encourage others to also buy (or borrow from your local library)  copies and then use them in ways that yield a series of ""Kairos moments"" and perhaps lead us all to a better place where we actually treat our neighbors the way we want to be treated.",1438387200,5,2521,4.9904761904761905
6891295,5,B00R041BMK,"As a layman in regards to the complex history of Palestine, I found this 55 minute documentary to be streamlined and focused.  I had always heard that Arabs, Christians, & Jews lived in relative peace into the 20th century, and this film eases the viewer into the crucial run-up to the first seeds of the divides.  How much can the blame be put on absentee Arab landowners who were more than willing to sell 'their father's inheritance' to the Zionists?  Were the new Jewish emigrants blind to the displacement caused or reluctant to share in the fruits of their progressive & successful conquering of the land?  Are these questions irrelevant because at the end of the day laws were not broken (an important point to note that even under various Ottoman rule [from Sultans to Young Turks], the rule of law was obeyed).  Just a few questions that this through-provoking and insightful film brought to this reviewer.",1437350400,11,915,4.802547770700637

6891297,1,B00R041BMK,"This film could be used in a university class on media as a classic example of how to propagandize.  Almost every sentence is slanted until the truth is almost broken,in a way calculated to seem insightful and original.

Example. ""A cameraman decides where to focus his camera. The famous photos of a small group of Jews standing on empty sand dunes as the future city of Tel Aviv is laid out could have turned around and photographed the vast orange groves of Jaffa owned by wealthy Arab landowners during the Ottoman Empire.""  THere is a deliberate implication that Jewish propaganda has changed the facts.  But the facts are simple and understandable. Jaffa was a bustling, crowded, small town.  South-east of Jaffa, away from the coast, it is very likely there was agriculture.  North of Jaffa there were miles of empty sanddunes. Jews built a brand new town there which became Tel Aviv.

Another example:  The Jews who moved to the area at the beginning of the twentieth century ""confronted their individual shortcomings by forming communities"".  Actually, Jewish groups of this period were passionate socialists, imbued with ideals of communal work and ownership as a solution to an unequal society.  What does this have to do with ""individual shortcomings""?

The filmmakers were clever, but not clever enough. It seems others reviewers above saw through the manipulation.",1435968000,7,1378,5.08
6891298,5,B00R041BMK,"Arabs and Jews relations deteriorated further in early 1900s mainly because of land buying and furthermore it got worse due to some fighting which apparently started with an Arab stealing some grapes on the way of bringing goods to Rehovot and then being chased by Hashomer guards. In the end a horse and a camel are shot, one Hashomer guard and one Arab are killed. This documentary covers Soklovskys 1913 documentary when meantime Arabs and Jews were trying to come to some resolution but 1914 WW1 intervened and any hope for resolution quickly faded.

In 1930, in Ottoman Parliament Ruhi Khalidi claimed The aim of Zionist is the creation of Israelite kingdom, whose capital is Jerusalem. After watching this documentary, I Goggled Palestine and my search resulted """"The region is also known as the Land of Israel"""" Arabs, Christians and Jews in 1900s were all apparently living in that region under Ottoman's ruling and I guess they are all now living under Israeli's ruling. After watching this documentary it certainly became more obvious to me that there will never ever be any peace in that region unless all parties involved directly or indirectly come to a peaceful resolution just like they were trying a century ago. This sounds the same as the story of American Indians in America as well as the Australia's Aboriginals. Sad, sad, sad situation since war is like a disease, no one is safe till there is peace. There is so much footage of that region from 1913 in such a high quality black and white that this documentary is well worth watching. Bravo.",1435881600,8,1564,4.835820895522388

8693451,1,B00R041BMK,"I really want to like this movie, as it details a very important period that few people really know about.

Many people think that the conflict there began after the British arrived in 1919 after World War 1.

What most people do not understand is that by 1914, those Eastern European Jews had been immigrating for almost 35 years already, now generations.  1914 (start of WW1) would simply be the halfway point in a 70 long-slow wave of immigration into that region (1880-1948).  And not much changed in that immigration pattern from the Ottoman Turk years, to the British administrative years.  Of all the land purchased by Jews in that region over that 70 year period, 1/3rd was purchased during those Ottoman years prior to 1914.

So, I think that this film gives people an introduction to the serious presence those Jews already had pre-WW1 (1914).  In that, it does a good job.

In fact, conflict was imminent at this early date. Unless the Arab population there, its leaders, could accept equality for those Jewish immigrants, there would be conflict.  The British arrival only delayed the inevitable conflict that was already written at this early date.

**************************************************
Now the criticism:

This film is very clearly biased.  It paints a picture of a poor aggrieved Arab population being overtaken by aggressive immigrating Jews determined to overtake them through the powerful force of Zionism.  And, it goes to great lengths to paint that overtaking as an almost violent affair on the part of the Jews.

It is almost a Cowboys and Indians (American) take on events there.

My criticism is that it way overplays the force and cohesion of Zionism, and even its end goal (a state), even making Arthur Ruppin as a serious villain in this nefarious plan.

Simply look at Jewish opinion today: from the Chomsky's on the Anti-Zionist left, thru the middle, and to the Kahanes on the far right.

You should be suspicious of any recounting of history that paints such black and white pictures.  The saying ""Two Jews, Three Opinions"" was just as much in force back then as it is today. From the far Anti-Zionist left, the Jewish Communists, the middle Judah Magnes, and Ruppin and Buber's Brit Shalom, to the Jabotinsky's Revisionist movement, and further right.  This was a raucous, democratic, pluralistic group of people back then, just as it is today.

The World Zionist Congress, shown in the movie, had a majority of Anti-Zionists until the early 1930's.  In fact, it was the Jewish Anti-Zionists in England that nearly killed the Balfour Declaration (1917).  World Jewry and certainly Western Jewry was decidedly anti-Zionist until after the Holocaust in 1945.  Zionism was merely a fringe movement, largely dismissed by World Jewry.  Zionism, as a mover of people was an outright dismal failure.

Certainly, before the Ottoman Turks disappeared in 1919, nobody had the slightest inclination that the 400 year rule by the Turks would just evaporate one day in the near future.  No, the great majority of the Jews migrating to Southern Syria, (a tiny fraction of Jews migrating, and a real tiny fraction of ALL Europeans migrating), came there for similar reasons as all migrating humans during that period: to escape horrible economic conditions in a very crowded Eastern and Southern Europe (persecution but a minor factor).  Perhaps a vague notion of a ""homeland,"" but certainly not their own ""state.""

And even the Zionist leadership was deeply divided, and the actual leadership never clamoring for their own ""state,"" certainly not during those Ottoman years, and even for the first two decades into British rule (until the Holocaust would unfold).

The movie spends much time on Arthur Ruppin.  He was one of the founders of Brit Shalom, an organization that would renunciate the Zionist aim of creating a Jewish state, and he among many others, the likes of Judah Magnes, simply sought equality with the Arabs.

I don't think you can tell the story of 1913 effectively without giving a glimpse for what would occur a few short years later.

The official Zionist position went through three phases over that 70-year period of immigration.

Certainly, during Ottoman times, there was no discussion about a ""state.""  Just a vague notion of a ""Jewish Homeland.""

During the first decade of British rule, the Jews simply wanted representation in a government there in Mandate Palestine under British administration, even if minority representation, with the same equal rights they had enjoyed under the Ottoman Turks.

First offered by Churchill in 1922, the Jews accepted, but subsequently, the Arabs refused to sit in a joint legislature with even a single Jew. Chaim Weizmann tried several times over the course of the 1920's to build this legislature, with no success.

After the brutal attacks on Jews in 1929, incited by Palestinian leader Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Zionist position officially changed in 1931 to demanding equal representation in a joint legislature with Arabs:  ""let no one group dominate the other.""  This was the Bi-National vision of Judah Magnes and organization Brit Shalom (and these opinions were made known in 1947 during the  UN investigation).

And, by 1939, the Jews were 1/3rd of the population there....some 500,000, and  absolutely dominated economically with 3-4 times the economic output as the Arabs.  It was this year, on the eve of WW2 beginning, that the British, in (another) grand act of Chamberlain Appeasement would throw the Jews ""under the bus,"" for their future national interests in the Arab world (oil) and coming war with the Nazis. They would take away Jewish citizen equal rights there, not allow them to buy property, shut the door tightly to Jewish immigration on the eve of the Holocaust, and, promise to put them under the  direct control of the Arabs led by then-Nazi Haj Amin al-Husseini.

And this would be the first time that the Jews would demand a state in 1942 as the Holocaust was in full motion:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biltmore_Conference

*********************
Contrast this with the Arab position over the same period.

The movie touches on the fact that the new immigrating Jews were very different  than the native Jews of that region, painting an almost negative picture of a more ""assertive aggressive Jew.""

The Tanzimat Reforms beginning in 1839 would transform the Ottomans to a SECULAR nation, with equal rights for all ethnicities and religions, secular courts, gay rights, and even the beginning of women's rights.

Those new immigrants understood  they were absolutely equal under the law. Those native Jews in Southern Syria certainly knew their place in society as 3rd class citizens, equally treated badly by the 2nd class Christians and the Muslims.  Big surprise that those new Jews would not step aside on the sidewalk for the Arab, and divert their eyes.  Very insulting indeed.

So, here we have immigrants landing in a secular region, just as 60 million Europeans are doing everywhere during the largest migration  in human history.

By 1889, the Arabs were already lobbying the Ottoman government in Istanbul to outlaw land sales to Jews and stop immigration.  If that happened here, in the secular USA, you would call those people racists.  The Jews were only about 8% of a VERY rural population at that point.

That would be the same Arab position in 1922 with the Churchill offer of a joint legislature, and by 1937 the Arab position became even more racist with claims that all Jews arrived since 1917 were there illegally, with strong suggestion of their imminent eviction.  That would be their same position going into the UN deliberations in 1947.

So, I fiercely disagree with the black and white narrative this movie paints.

It does talk about the ""negative"" of newer immigrants in the early 1900's displacing Arab workers on Jewish farms, but it does not expand on the great deal of cooperation and inter-dependency of those populations.  Even by the mid-1930's, tens of thousands of Arabs were employed in Jewish owned businesses, and many Jews worked for Arab owners of businesses in the cities and towns.

Citing the Rehovot event as a turning point, or, a seed of this conflict is just preposterous.

Life in rural Palestine was always rather dangerous, even before the Jews arrived.  The rural Arabs never lived on individual homesteads, but lived in protected villages as the nomadic Bedouin population always created challenges, with thievery a major reality in rural life.

So yes there were occasional tussles.  There were minor tussles over thievery.  There were minor tussles over land disputes.  Tussles over access rights.  Very normal things that would occur amongst any groups in their interaction anywhere.  And those minor events need to viewed through a big lense that looks at the positive interactions between those same populations during the same exact period.

And to paint a picture of the Jews as rather violent against the Arab population is extremely unfair.  Sure, there were some aggressive members of the Ha'shomer in some of those minor rural tussles during a certain period. But the great bulk of Jews were pacifists during that period.

And if you look at the entire history there, those Jews were absolutely devoted to peaceful immigration.  Haganah, the Jewish defense organization that would replace the Ha'shomer a few years later, would never consider retaliatory measure against Arab terror unleashed against innocent Jewish civilians. They would rely on the British for that.  Havlagah was the official policy there, strictly adhered to

In fact, the only period of Jewish retaliation (and even terror) against Arabs in the ENTIRE 70 years (before war would break out Dec 1947) was a 16-month period during the Arab Insurgency (1936-1939).  This was not just an insurgency to push the British out, but a terror campaign against innocent Jews and against other Arabs.  Irgun would rise up for the first time to counter-terrorize the Arab population to stem the tide of unstoppable terror against innocent Jews. When that insurgency ended in 1939, Irgun would never again attack Arabs until the civil war began in Dec 1947, and Arab terror against Jewish civilians began once again.

**********************************************
So, no, the Seed of Conflict did not begin in 1913.

The Seed of Conflict began the moment those first immigrants arrived.

One can even argue that The Seed of Conflict was modernity brought to that region.

The drivers that drove 60 million humans out of Europe between 1880-1930:  industrialization and agrarian reform: the aggregation of lands for mass production that would displace the centuries-old tenant class by the millions, first in Western Europe in the earlier 1800's, and now in Eastern and Southern Europe would also impact Southern Syria with the influx of those immigrants, modern agriculture, industry, electricity, etc..

So, perhaps we can even identify the Seed of Conflict as the  year 1839, the date that the Ottomans decided to modernize the Empire with secular reforms and a change in Land Tenure (1856) that would pave the way to the same agrarian reform that was sweeping Western Europe during that period.

And, in secular countries, even an ethnic majority gets no exclusive claim to rights over minorities.  That 80% plus of uninhabited ""State"" land in Southern Syria was no more ""Muslim Land"" than we can say that the National Parks here in the USA are ""Christian Lands.""  That the Arab community was slow to understand  the implications of that change would be an understatement.

Those 60 million Europeans in flight from 1880-1930 would double the population of the USA. Most of those immigrants would land in the Americas, 75% in the USA.  Nearly all European Jews ended up in the Americas too.  97% in fact.

They were ALL immigrating into SECULAR countries, under the rule of law in their new host countries, buying property, disputes heard in established courts, starting businesses, making babies, and living their new lives, often irritating the native population in those destinations (certainly true here in the USA).  That trickle of Europeans into those Secular Ottoman Lands was NO DIFFERENT.
************************************

So, yes, this movie, its narrative, paints a very black and white picture, that completely supports the narrative of an innocent native population overtaken by aggressive colonialists.  That is a ""cherry-pick of facts"" to support a very unhelpful narrative that guarantees perpetuation of this conflict today.  It is very unfortunate, because the movie is an excellent production, and there are many facts that are fascinating and truthful.",1508544000,4,12738,5.135922330097087

An Ottoman Region
Revolution Comes to Palestine
A Larger Vision at Work
Sowing Seeds of Conflict

This video wants to understand why the Jews and arabs could/did live together in 1913 and can't/won't now.

Explains both the Jewish and Ottoman background. The nineteenth century Jews in Palestine were Sephardi. They spoke Arabic and thought themselves Ottomans. Then the Russian pograms began. Russian Jews now arrive and change the culture.

Shows the 1913 film that presents the vision of all, Jews, Muslims, Christians working and living together. 'Cultural fluidity', all drink coffee together in the the evening hours. Famous quartet has a Jew, Christian and Arab.

 Focuses on the early work and ideas of Albert Antebi, an Ottoman Jew. In his life a new group of Jews arrive from Russia. They are determined Marxists. Profoundly affect the Zionist movement. Antebi worried. He was right to worry.

Eventually the weakness of the faraway Ottoman government brings lawlessness. The Russian Jews bring their bitterness, anger, revolutionary mindset. The conflict appears.

This report presents the players in words from the written historical record. They speak in French, German, Russian, Arabic and Hebrew, (subtitles in English). Actors express the feelings, not just the words. Well done!

Includes several scholars adding commentary with both Western and Arabic professors.

This is a subtle and carefully drawn portrait. Covers considerable detail in the 60 minutes. Moves fast and kept my interest. Plan to review with my grandson. Good match with Schama's - ''Story of the Jews.''

Ends with the strart of WW1. Nothing ever the same.

Insightful explanation. Emphasis on the the huge difference between 1913 and since. Narrator expresses a wistful yearning for the better days of 1913. So do we all.
