8592645,5,B001G8S0KW,You must see both films to have a timeline of the argentine political history. They capture in a very objective way-the main political personalities and events as well as the reactions of the people. As an argentinian I was impressed by the constant violence in the streets since the early 1900's and more so by the premeditated torture and killing of the 1976-83 period. This was not graphically depicted in the film-but still-very well captured . I recommend it highly.,1273622400,,471,4.9
