Acclaimed director Andr Tchin brings a gripping real-life thriller to the screen, which is set in 1976. When her marriage falls apart, Agns Le Roux [Adle Haenel] moves back to the South of France from Africa to live with her mother, Rene Le Roux [Catherine Deneuve], owner of the Palais de La Mediterrane casino in Nice. There, Agns Le Roux falls in love with Maurice Agnelet [Guillaume Canet], a lawyer and Rene Le Rouxs business advisor, who is ten years her senior. Maurice continues to have relationships with other women and Agns is madly in love with him. As a shareholder in the Palais de la Mediteranne casino and Agns Le Roux decides to sell what should have been her inheritance to go it alone. A fixed card game threatens the casinos financial stability. Someone is trying to intimidate her mother. Behind the scenes hangs the shadow of the mafia and Fratoni, the owner of a rival casino, who wants to take over the Palais de la Mediteranne. Maurice Agnelet, who has fallen from grace with Rene Le Roux, introduces Agns Le Roux to Fratoni [Jean Corso]. Fratoni offers her 3 million francs to vote against her mother in the shareholders meeting and Agns Le Roux accepts the offer. Rene Le Roux loses control of the casino. Agns Le Roux finds it hard to cope with her betrayal. Maurice also distances himself from her. In November 1977, after a failed suicide attempt, Agns Le Roux disappears and her body is never found. Thirty years on, Maurice Agnelet remains the prime suspect in a murder case with no body and no proof of his guilt. Convinced of his involvement, Rene Le Roux is prepared to fight to the bitter end to see him put behind bars...

Andrews Blu-ray Review: 'In the Name of My Daughter' ['L'Homme Qu'on Aimait Trop'] and Guillaume Canet, Catherine Deneuve and Adle Haenel star as the key figures in a three-way power play in French veteran director Andr Tchin latest film. The film is based-on-fact and a historical thriller chronicling the rise and fall of Madame Rene Le Roux [Catherine Deneuve], owner of the Palais de la Mediterranee casino in Niece, who during the 1970s saw her fortunes deteriorate when she becomes the last casino magnate to lose control of her business to the mafia, in this instance due in no small part to the board room betrayal of her heiress daughter Agns Le Roux [Adle Haenel]. Both end up involved with the angry and mysterious Maurice Agnelet [Guillaume Canet], the man both literally and figuratively leading to the great, terrible tragedy that would bring both women to ruin.

The latest film from French auteur director Andr Tchins In the Name of My Daughter [2014] received a decent theatrical run after it premiered out of competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. With stars Catherine Deneuve and Guillaume Canet headlining, the recent Cesar Awards win for Adele Haenel (which was her second award). A handsomely mounted piece based on a bit of unsolved criminal intrigue, the title doesnt always work as a thriller, but maintains a rather melancholy stance as an off-kilter character piece for Catherine Deneuve and Adle Haenel. Its a frustrating affair that kept me at arms length throughout, and just when things should be exploding in heartfelt tragedy the overall effect it had on me as I sat there watching was nothing more than a feeling of moderately curious indifference.

Not that any of this really matters, as it concerns Catherine Deneuve the legendary actress and icon reminds us all once again just how amazing she continues to be, delivering a complex, not entirely likeably performance that burns with a passionate intensity for the entire length of the films running time. Catherine Deneuves is totally fascinating, the way she develops Madame Rene Le Rouxs intricate, hardly wholesome relationship with Agns Le Roux bordering on wondrous, the pair of actresses and newcomer Adele Haenel is equally superb, making the most of every moment they share together allowing for a palpable sense of intense grief fuelling much of what ends up happening to the both of them that simply would not exist without their efforts.

As mother and daughter fall out, Maurice Agnelets [Guillaume Canet], motives turn ever murkier, and Agns Le Roux never plunges deeper into passionate infatuation, viewers may feel that theyd get more sense, and perhaps more dramatic nuance, from the book that Rene Le Roux herself co-wrote about the case and with her son Jean-Charles Le Roux, co-writer on the film too. A stolid courtroom coda may leave us none the wiser, but places the weight of the film firmly back with Catherine Deneuve, who is fairly magnificent throughout and whether as the haggard older Rene Le Roux or as the glittering grande dame of the casino scene.

Sadly, Maurice Agnelet [Guillaume Canet] is never fleshed out in ways that could allow the crux of the tragic mysteries empowering the drama to resonate, and as great as an actor Guillaume Canet might be he simply appears more than a little lost as to the best way to navigate things here. Director Andr Tchin, as always, has crafted a visually sumptuous motion picture, but many of these eye-popping tricks do not serve a purpose, the way he plays with time and how he allows editor Herv de Luze [The Pianist] to eccentrically tie scenes together equally so. In the Name of My Mother certainly has much to recommend, especially most of the film and the acting is certainly the films trump card, with Guillaume Canet relishing the snake-like performance, and the ever more impressive is the young actress Adele Hanuel is phenomenal as the tortured Agns Le Roux heiress. In her freighted relationship with her mother and in her doomed obsession with Maurice Agnelet, and Adele Hanuel proves herself to be fully worthy of the accolades she is getting in Europe. Theres an emotional nuance to her performance that comes closest to the dynamic quality that the film needs. What Andr Tchin does capture convincingly is a portrait of a woman unravelled due to manipulation and neglect. Recent Cesar award winning Adle Haenel is superb as the unfortunate heiress, and she steals a handful of sequences, whether they are innocuous bits where she performs an African dance, or a nasty bit that finds her voting against her mother at a casino board meeting. Fans of the brilliant actors Catherine Deneuve and Guillaume Canet should check this out brilliant film, for their performances are brilliant. Technical merits are generally first rate for those considering a purchase this beautiful Blu-ray disc. Some people have criticised how slow the film is, but I feel you get to know more about the characters of this real-life drama unfolds in a beautiful slow paced 116 minutes, and you will be rewards when the credits roll up the screen and it is a film that the French can only produce.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'In the Name of My Daughter' presentation from Cohen Media Group Blu-ray is a glorious spectacular 1080p encoded image, with an equally stunning 2.40:1 aspect ratio. The French region has some stunning glorious scenery of the French Riviera that is distinctive lusciously colourfully displayed, and provides regular explosive colours to the backgrounds of the scenery, as do the crystal clear blue skies, either through the lighting choices or superb colour grading, which gives us excellence of fine detail, that look particularly lifelike and organic, especially with the close-ups. Overall, the image is beautifully crisp, clear, and full of abundant detail, and often quite gorgeously in certain scenic vistas scenes and especially filled with impressive art direction and the cinematography is beautifully shot, especially the filming on the Riviera you pretty much get beautiful shots wherever you plonk your camera. The overly ornate casino is the location of much action, but so is the balcony of Rene's villa, where you can really see why the name Cte d'Azur caught on.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Again 'In the Name of My Daughter' presentation from Cohen Media Group Blu-ray release defaults to the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track instead of a standard 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio track that is also included. The sound mix is very subtle, though typically immersive with such elements as background ocean noises or the breezes, or when inside the casino, and especially the rabble of various games being played simultaneously. Most of the film plays out in the intimate dialogue scenes, which are understandably more constrained in their surround sound activity. When it comes to composer Benjamin Biolay, his music score is rendered exceedingly crisp and total clean and all in all a very pleasant audio presentation.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Q & A with Guillaume Canet [1080p] [52:35] This is a far ranging conversation, where Kent Jones moderates a Film Society of Lincoln Center with a Q & A with the films male lead Guillaume Canet; and some great stuff on what it was like to work with legends that is the director Andr Tchin and the actress Catherine Deneuve. What is great about this Question and Answer session is that Guillaume Canet speaks in brilliant English. He tells us that he has actually met the real life Lawyer Maurice Agnelet in prison. Lawyer Maurice Agnelet read the script, but has not seen the film and Guillaume is asked if he asked Maurice Agnelet is he did murder Agns Le Roux the daughter and Guillaume said, no way. We find out the Lawyer Maurice Agnelet is in fact in a Psychiatric Hospital and the authority was reluctant to allow Guillaume to do a deep probing interview with Maurice Agnelet, who is now diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Guillaume tells us that they shot some of the scenes at the actual locations and also they shot other scenes in the Northern part of France, especially in some of the little quaint towns that have not changed a lot, especially as the film did not have a big budget and it was shot over 36 days. We also find out from Guillaume that he has done some directing himself and the films he mentions are Sans Regrets [1996]; Scnarios sur la drogue [2000]; J'peux pas dormir [2000]; Mon Idole [2002]; Tell No One [2006]; Little White Lies [2010] and Blood Ties [2013], but originally before he became an actor, dreamed of being a director. Guillaume talks extensively about the real life family in the film and especially the real life lawyer who wanted to run the casino 100%, but we find out that the other casino in the same location involved in the real life drama was in competition and was run by the mob which wanted to close down the Madame Rene Le Roux Palais de La Mediterrane casino in Nice. The real life Mother and Daughter hated each other and the real life Lawyer wanted the daughter to sell her shares in the casino. Again when ever Guillaume went to talk to the real Lawyer it was a totally unreal experience and would tell him lots of secrets, especially while the film was being shot and had to do a quick re-write of the script. Guillaume also talks a lot about meeting for the first time meeting the actress Catherine Deneuve and panicked a lot and kept forgetting his lines because he was so nervous and perspired a lot and never felt himself and when talking to her was lost for words, but over time calmed down, but he also tells us that Catherine Deneuve would forget her lines quite a bit. Guillaume talks about a film he is involved with acting in for NETFLIX and is set South Africa in the 1960s and it involves French mercenaries to protect some mines. One of the questions he is asked what is the one actor and director he would like to work with and the actor he admired the most is Daniel Day-Lewis and the director he would like to work with is Martin Scorsese, but he also praises the film WHIPLASH [2014]. Guillaume at times is very fussy that the period costumes have to exactly right for a period the film is set like the film In the Name of My Daughter. Finally, Guillaume also tells us that he loves the process of doing a screenplay and also likes composing music for a film he is directing which is very important to get it right. So at that point the interview finishes and it was totally brilliant at also very fascinating at the same time and well worth a view and again Guillaume speaks excellent English.

Theatrical Trailer [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:08] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for In the Name of My Daughter and it is a great presentation, but I cannot understand why it was not show in the original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.

Finally, In the Name of My Daughter from the director Andr Tchin, has been given by some critics that the film too unfocused, pointlessly sprawling, well I think they are too harsh, as the French have a different approach to a film of this calibre, but a must reminder of the continued magnetic cinematic glory that is Catherine Deneuve and it is a winner on all fronts, the actress almost entirely on her own making the films an essential piece of cryptic international entertainment fans of the actress should definitely make it a point to see. What Andr Tchin does capture convincingly is a portrait of a woman unravelled due to manipulation and neglect. Recent Cesar award winning Adle Haenel is superb as the unfortunate heiress, and she steals a handful of sequences, that finds her voting against her mother at a casino board meeting. The acting is certainly the films trump card, with Guillaume Canet relishing a snake-like performance, and the ever more impressive Adle Haenel mustering a troubling intensity as the doomed, passionate Agns Le Roux. With the films real life case still shrouded in mystery and a sensitive issue for the family affected, its understandable that Andr Tchin would approach it with respectful subtlety. His refined directing style is certainly admirable, and at least worth it to see two great actresses at the top of their game and it is certainly one of the more entertaining of the true-life story film that was released in 2014. Highly Recommended!

7310825,5,B010GEUKVS,"Prolific French director Andr Tchin, who tackled a true-life legal case in 2009's The Girl on the Train, returns to the genre with In the Name of My Daughter, a fascinating, suspenseful story about obsessive love, money, the Mafia, and murder.

The film tells of a crime that has fascinated the French for more than three decades: the disappearance in 1977 of casino heiress Agns Le Roux (Adle Haenel), a beautiful young divorcee who returns home to Nice from Africa after a disastrous five-year marriage.

She finds herself embroiled in an economic war between her mother, Rene Le Roux (Catherine Deneuve), and a powerful local businessman named Fratoni (Jean Corso), a suspected Mafia money-launderer.

Deneuve is brilliant as Rene, a steely-willed widow whose badly managed multimillion-dollar Palais de la Mditerrane casino is hemorrhaging money during an economic downturn. Things go from bad to worse when Fratoni begins a campaign of intimidation to buy out the Le Roux family.

Deeply depressed by her divorce, Agns finds herself drawn to one of her mother's lawyers, a scrappy young upstart named Maurice (Guillaume Canet) whose ridiculous demeanor - always serious, he wears his tight three-piece suit even on the beach - conceals a cynical, calculating, and brilliant intellect.

Canet turns in an astounding performance as Maurice, whose inscrutable face gives away nothing. He is scrupulously honest with Agns, telling her that she is only one of his numerous lovers. What he doesn't tell her is that he lives off the generosity of his lovers, all of whom seem to be quite wealthy.

Things turn ugly when Rene refuses to give Maurice a plum job at her company. Using Agns, who has considerable holdings in the casino, the lawyer comes up with a scheme to help Fratoni take over the Palais de la Mditerrane and make himself a big pot of cash.

Once the dirty business is done, Agns disappears.

Tchin's approach is nothing short of brilliant: He gives us a deep understanding of the psychological dynamics in this strange story by spending most of the film retelling the story of Agns' doomed relationships with her mother and Maurice. This leaves the director with only about 20 minutes to show us the strange series of court cases that followed Agns' disappearance.

While Agns' body was never recovered, her mother was convinced she had been murdered, and repeatedly petitioned prosecutors to go after Maurice.

The lawyer, who pocketed all of Agns' money and moved first to Canada, then to Panama, was put on trial no less than three times. He was acquitted in the 1980s, but that verdict was overthrown in 2005. In a strange turn of events, he was convicted in 2014 after his own son testified against him. He is appealing the verdict.

Tchin's film is adapted from the memoir Une femme face  la Mafia, written by Rene Le Roux and her son, Jean-Charles Le Roux, in the late 1980s and updated after the 2014 trial. But one does not have to be familiar with the book or the facts of the case to enjoy this superb, beautifully crafted psychological thriller.",1447891200,,3072,4.909266409266409
7310826,3,B010GEUKVS,"In the Name of My Daughter focuses on a crime that has intrigued the French for over thirty years: the disappearance in 1977 of casino heiress Agnes Le Roux (Adele Haenel), a young divorcee who returns home to her mother, Renee (Catherine Deneuve), in Nice from Africa after a tumultuous five-year marriage, eager to start a new life. Renee, owner of a fancy casino in the south of France, is being pressured by the local mafia to turn over the casino to them. Agnes is drawn to Renees business advisor, Maurice (Guillaume Canet), an ambitious lawyer ten years older than she. The three form a complex threesome, with increasing consequences.

Though supposedly a crime thriller, In the Name of My Daughter is pretty tame. Much of the film is devoted to the mother-daughter relationship, though its never made clear why Agnes is resentful of Renee. Theres an interesting spin on the typical film noir femme fatale plot, with Agnes being attracted to a man who draws her into foul deeds.

Ms. Deneuve is lovely and elegant  a perfect fit as proprietor of a swank Riviera casino. The actress has aged gracefully and brings a huge helping of class to the proceedings with her imperious demeanor. Since Agnes is portrayed as high-strung and fragile, Ms. Haenel has the widest rage of emotions to play and nicely conveys Agnes multi-faceted personality.

Director Andre Techine has incorporated some beautiful locations and crafted characters that are not so easy to read. Though the pace could have been picked up considerably, the movie offers a fascinating look at a family against the colorful world of casinos and organized crime.

Blu-ray bonus features include a Q & A with actor Guillaume Canet and a theatrical trailer. The movie is in French, with English subtitles.",1442707200,7,1771,4.929530201342282
7310827,4,B010GEUKVS,"I came to this BD because of other recent films starring the always beautiful (and legendary) French actress Catherine Deneuve which have been released by the Cohen Media Group. Ive very glad I saw it and very glad that I read nothing about it (not even the back of the package) before watching it. I highly recommend that others do this too, to get the most out of the film.

The film  based on real events in France  is sort of a mystery and crime drama but that is not what I felt the film was about. Its about family relationships and loneness and mental issues too. The long paragraph on the back of the package (in print so minuscule that you will need a magnifying glass to read it) really gives the full plot and is loaded with spoilers. (If youve read my other Amazon reviews, you know I hate spoilers. So  again  I encourage you to not read this till after youve seen the nearly-two-hour film. And watch for reviews that give too much away.
With that said, if you are a Deneuve fan (I am!), youll love her performance. The film starts in the late 1970s and ends up 30 years later. (and Deneuve is stunning!). The much younger actress who plays her daughter doesnt have Deneuves beauty (in my personal opinion) but can be very sensual and there is nudity and some very hot love making scenes involving her.

The film is in the wide screen aspect so even with an HD TV you will have black bars above and below. But the southern French coastline is gorgeously photographed.

The English subtitles are in white and quite often it was difficult to read them; I had to hit the pause button or scan back. I wish that they were in yellow or green as they are the most contrasting and easy to read.

The Bluray has one bonus in addition to the theatrical trailer. It is a Q&A with actor Guillaume Canet recorded at a Lincoln Center screening. It is in English. It runs nearly 55 minutes. The problem with the interview is that they are discussing two different films in which Canet played a real life character. Nearly the first six minutes is about the other film  whose title is never given. I wasn't interested in the other film and the interview goes on way too long (again, my opinion) but others might want to spend the time.

So I really liked the film for the acting and the mood. The story has a bunch of loose ends (mostly re: a Mafia king pin) and so I cant give it 5 stars.
But, again, if you are a Deneuve fan take a chance on this film and go in knowing nothing about the story. Youll enjoy it much more.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7310836,3,B010GEUKVS,"The acting, the cinematography, were superb. But what of the storyline? Supposedly, it is loosely based on true events. But the apportionment of the time between the 1970s and thirty years later is all wrong. Major events are discussed in a synopsis that appears as an epilogue (Two trials that reverse the jury's conclusions, the son's accusation of his father, are given only written one-liners.) Catrine Deneuve is also misused. When she appears in the 1970s, she is already a portly matron of a fairly advanced age. It would have been better if a younger actress played that part, and Deneuve played herself 30 years later. Canet's makeup for his aged self is terrible. It is too obviously artificial. In all, there are two many important faults to this movie which pulled it down considerably in my estimation. 2 1/2 stars",1475712000,2,827,4.872340425531915

7310841,3,B010GEUKVS,"This is a good enough movie, not a really good one, but I still couldn't stop watching. It's based in real events, actually adapted from the autobiography of  Renee Le Roux.  Renee Le Roux ( Catherine Deneuve), by one vote, her daughter's, takes over leadership of a failing casino; this outcome unfavored by the ostensibly Mafia-connected board. Agnes (Adele Haenel), the recently divorced daughter, comes under the sexual spell and self-serving business guidance of her mother's cast-off attorney, Maurice Agnelet (Guillaume Canet), and Agnes's support for mom shifts. The rest is to be seen. The acting is good, as is the photography, depicting some beautiful natural landscapes of the south of France. A few attention grabbing moments are: the solo singing at the Mafia extended family dinner, the Deneuve character singing along with her chauffeur to the car radio, Agnes's African dance, as well as the honest survey of her body in advance of her first tryst with Agnelet; and, as a constant swimmer, I  enjoyed  her taking advantage of every available body of water for a quick swim. A tad of exploration of casino inner workings and explanation of some of its terminology is interesting. There are some deepish moments.  It's just not very gutsy, considering the magnitude of the events ( I know I'm leaving the biggest ones a secret). Even the sex is pretty rudimentary.

I didn't realize upon the end that it was a true story and may have appreciated more knowing that fact. Love the singing in the car with ""Stand By Me"" and in French!  Also, I must mention the filmography was beautiful especially the rural French county side, under water swimming scenes and many others.  The movie was sad watching a newly divorced young lady go from one bad relationship to another.  All the actors were very good.",1499731200,,535,4.6

Daughter and mothers relationship was very hard to comprehend. They live in same town but barely saw each other..seemed to be some affection at beginning of movie but daughter turned against the mother rather quickly.

Miss Deneuve as elegant and chic as ever, great and an  amazing performance as a woman desperate to keep the business and as a mother wanted to get justice. Locations are superb, but the rest of the cast felt short on performance . This one was one woman show. That is why I gave this movie a 5 stars.",1498694400,,375,4.054054054054054
8722382,4,B010GEUKVS,"Based on a true story, this (spoilers warning!) is a tale of the wrong man, with the wrong intentions, tearing a family apart.

Deneuve delivers a tour de force performance. Not only is she stunning-looking as the silver-haired casino owner who's dedicated most of her life to running her business, potentially at the expense of her relationship with her daughter, but she is very believable as the parent who will ultimately not give up on her child, no matter their complicated history.

Haenel does a terrific job as the rebellious daughter who looks for love in all the wrong places. And Canet is the sort of slithering, sinister character one dreads in a whodunnit plot because no one sees him for what he truly is (except Deneuve's character).

Engrossing film, well done, with a surprise ending.",1497744000,,802,4.882352941176471
8722383,3,B010GEUKVS,"Catherine Deneuve is more subtle than usual but still a joy to watch.  The roles of her daughter and first ""lawyer"" are played by actors who are annoying and lackluster.  The daughter's attraction to her mother's lawyer is unconvincing..  This guy has the charm of a block of wood.  The daughter is unattractive, boring, tedious and, therefore, unconvincing, as well.  The scenery is beautiful, of course.  Interesting that this film is based on a true story.  Unfortunately, all the meaningful info a viewer would want to know at the end is reduced to a few lines scrolled on the screen as an afterthought.",1495065600,3,607,4.834951456310679
8722384,5,B010GEUKVS,"Dramatic, subtle, humane, barbarous (under the skin), gentle (under the skin):  in effect, the movie gets under your skin.  A great ensemble work in which the unparalleled Catherine Deneuve does not steal the show; she raises the bar and causes, with director Techine, all the actors to rise to her level.  In this tragedy, Deneuve is also delightful and finds mirth -- as does the figure of her daughter.  Justice is not complete; it has its hidden mysteries that deprive us of knowing the absolute truth, as there is no such thing in the human theater in which we live.",1489968000,,571,4.68
