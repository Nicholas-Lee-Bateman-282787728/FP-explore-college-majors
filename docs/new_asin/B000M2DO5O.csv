8165901,5,B000M2DO5O,"Who says parents should instinctively know how to deal with every parenting situation? Thank goodness for Dr. Ann and her logical, practical wisdom that she shares in this DVD. I had so many ""A-Ha"" moments where I found myself saying, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" Even my husband, who doesn't always take time to read parenting books, was captured by what Dr. Ann shares in this DVD. As a mom of 4 kids, I have used the tools Dr. Ann teaches. I can honestly say they work! When we parents change our behavior, the behavior of our kids changes too! No matter what challenge you're facing with your kids, this DVD will give you the fundamental understanding of how to be empowered to handle anything. It's helped me with toilet training, sibling rivalry, disciplining (getting kids to do something the FIRST time I ask), security/separation issues, and everyday issues that arise. It's taught me that parenting doesn't have to be frustrating and difficult. Thanks to Dr. Ann and her DVD, parenting can actually be a pleasant and rewarding journey. If you read this review, Dr. Ann, thank you for making me a better mommy!",1272153600,,1120,4.748717948717949

Dr Ann's philosophy allows parents to learn control measures that help children perform positively with the knowledge that they are safe and loved.

I have used Dr Ann's suggestions successfully with my grandchildren and have witnessed Dr Ann practice her methods in groups.  If discipline for children is of special concern, you might want to try The Parenting Passport, a new publication by Dr Ann.  You can obtain it at [..]",1271980800,,624,5.326530612244898
8165904,5,B000M2DO5O,"I was referred to Dr. Ann Corwin through a Mom's club that I belonged to when my son was younger. I had a few private coaching sessions with her and then learned about her DVD, which is just like having her in your own living room!

I must have watched this video about 10 times now: it is packed with amazing information for helping to get your kid do what you want him to do... every single time! Whenever I have new challenges with my son, I review the video to remember Dr. Corwin's easy-to-follow ideas on how to successfully outsmart the defiant child. I highly recommend this DVD for any parent who wishes to have a more peaceful relationship with their children.",1270512000,,670,4.4471544715447155
