Many many special features and you get 16 fully loaded discs and each one is remarkably well informative. I pride myself on my knowledge of Yankee history and I learned things about the team and players that i didn't know before. The Yes network did an exceptionly well job on this and they should be commended. The old,ancient video of the BABE,THE IRON HORSE,YOGI,MICKY,WHITEY and many more is worth the price alone. I was also so glad to see extended pieces on THE OLD PERFESSOR CASSEY STENGEL too. What an excellent package and you cannot beat the price.

8432292,3,B004K4FUXO,"The best Yankees gift anyone could give to a Yankee fan. :)  It has 16 DVDs, BUT, the DVDs are in the book in their tight DVD slots.  It's very easy  to scratch while ever so gently pulling them out, or putting them in again.  Not a very good idea on the people who made this item.  Buy some blank DVD cases & put all 16 DVDs in those cases if you want your DVDs staying unscratched.  That is my only gripe, & it's a big one considering the price is primarily due to the 16 DVDs, & not so much the big book.  The book is big, but don't let it fool you, it's no 900 pages, the DVDs tell most of the players' stories, so be careful with the DVDs. :)",1452384000,2,647,3.819548872180451

If you have not this is a must see for Yankee fans.  Anyone who is anyone in Yankee History is featured.  I shouldn't say that, there are a lot of great Yankees and you can't feature them all... but this is a collection of the Yankees we all know and love.

Mattingly, Jeter, Gehrig, Ruth, DiMaggio, and on and on.

YES Network did a great job featuring the greats, and highlighting their careers.  Remember these are done by the Yankees so they are cast in a positive light so you won't be seeing gossip or negativity towards the players.",1424822400,,637,4.401709401709402
