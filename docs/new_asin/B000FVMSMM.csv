2592602,5,B000FVMSMM,"Like another commenter, I had the privilege of having Artemis as my first belly dancing teacher, and of seeing her perform many times.  She is such a joyous, as well as skilled dancer.  I can't wait to get this DVD!

2592604,4,B000FVMSMM,"Excellent DVD, but boooring!  If you can sit for hours and listen to her talk about Turkish style dance, then go for it.  She is the best Turkish teacher around, well, except for maybe Eva Cernick....",1188604800,4,200,4.527777777777778
2592605,5,B000FVMSMM,"This is an excellent instructional dvd on Turkish style bellydance. The instructor Elizabeth Artemis Mourat seems to have a lot of respect and enthusiasm for this subject manner.  So far this is tmy favorite dvd on Turkish Oriental Dance.

One special feature is a mini documentary about the differences and similarities between Turkish and Egyptian styles of Oriental Dance and their evolution.  I found this introduction helpful as I have primarily studied Egyptian and American styles of bellydance, so the comparison approach worked well for me.

The instructor also does an excellent job of explaining the slow and fast 9/8 rhythms that are popular in Turkisha and American styles of dance. I was especially interested in her discussion of the similarities and differences between ""Romany 9/8"" and ""Caberet 9/8"".

She then teaches a variety of isolotions or moves and combinations. Her instruction is clear and engaging and the moves are energetic and fun!

She concludes with an excellent performance that demonstrates the passion and energy of Turkish Oriental Dance. Overall, the dvd presentation is very well organized, flows well and the production quality is high. This dvd is suitable for dancers of most levels except possibly very experienced Turkish style dancers.",1183334400,10,1279,5.338308457711443
2592606,5,B000FVMSMM,I'm relearning belly dancing at the almost age of 60.  I really like the way the moves are presented.  If I don't get too wiggle happy I can make it through the entire DVD and still move the next morning.,1178668800,4,204,4.075
2592607,5,B000FVMSMM,"This is an excellent introduction to Turkish Oriental dance from one of the best Turkish dancers and teachers in the US. Artemis begins with a brief history, including a discussion of Romany culture and video examples of the differences between Egyptian and Turkish-style dance. The DVD, which is easy to follow and very comprehensive, provides instruction on uniquely Turkish rhythms, pelvic and hip articulations, turns, and hand gestures. Artemis also includes some slow and fast combinations, a cute choreography, and a brief improvised performance. I have been taking beginner to intermediate-level dance classes with Artemis for about a year, and I still found lots of fresh material in this DVD. Both beginners and advanced dancers will benefit from it.",1176768000,16,760,5.394957983193278
2592608,5,B000FVMSMM,"hey guys, while I haven't bought this DVD yet, I just wanted to tell you all that I had the pleasure of having Artemis as my very first bellydance teacher and she is wonderful!  i remember I was in class when she told us this DVD was being released and I think it will benefit anyone who sees it!  She was a wonderful teacher and even though I've been to others, she was genuinely the best teach I've had!  Buy it!",1174694400,2,414,4.08641975308642
2592609,4,B000FVMSMM,"Very sweet and endearing in her manner, Fahteim teaches you some important stuff about the way arms are used in belly dance. She goes through nine basic positions, shows you how to move arms in space at different speeds, giv es you some arm designs and throws in some combinations as well. The reason I don't give this video five points though is that the menu system is very nice and mixed up, and overall the video seems to have no replay value after a short while. However, that may be because I didn't get it when I was an absolute beginner. If it's for beginners, it should probably say so. If you've danced for a while, you end up realising some basics--and then you're done. Another reason is that lots of the well-known arm poses are not covered. All said and done though--am I glad I own the video? Yep.",1166400000,13,812,4.3841059602649
2592610,5,B000FVMSMM,"I purchased Beautiful Hands and Arms Belly Dance Instructional DVD because I am a beginner and I was struggling with presenting my arms in a graceful way.  This instructional DVD far exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to other aspiring dancers.

Fahtiem's explanations are clear and have enough detail to impart pertinent knowledge without being boring.  I anticipate getting long-term use of this DVD as the material covered is varied and extensive enough to continue to challenge and inspire me for many viewings.",1154736000,26,530,5.211764705882353

8127386,5,B000FVMSMM,"I was really impressed by this DVD. Yes, the price is higher than some, but well worth it for the information therein and running time. Her explanations are thorough and practical, and they take you from the very basic to a functional level in the style. The one thing that I feel really seals the style is the sunken in chest posture/concave shoulder and inward circling of the arms, which you see her do, but is never really brought to attention, and is a distinct characteristic (or seems to be) of the Romani style and a huge differentiation between this and Egyptian style. However, if you watch this DVD enough, you should pick up on it by imitating her. This should be a staple of any belly dancer's collection, even if Turkish is not your emphasis.",1433808000,,756,4.5661764705882355
8127387,5,B000FVMSMM,"I just finished watching the above DVD.  I loved it and am awarding top stars.
Artemis featured the Karsalama 9/8 rhythm cabaret style.
She begins by giving history of Turkish dance and explaining the difference between Turkish belly dancing and Egyptian.  (Turkish passionate and more energetic; Egyptian more elegant.)  Very interesting and a plus for this video..
Artemis speaks clearly, explains and demonstrates in a very detailed way how to move the body to obtain perfection of the steps.  She goes by sections (head, shoulders, abdominal and pelvic isolations, etc.)
She ends with a performance wearing a fabulous costume.  It made me want to get up and dance.
The production was beautifully and professionally done.",1420502400,,724,5.260869565217392
8127388,2,B000FVMSMM,I paid $7.00 for this DVD used and I still feel a little cheated. Turkish Belly dance by Ruby was more informative and unique. Don't buy this disc unless you can find it for $9.99 or less.,1410652800,,188,4.108108108108108
8127389,5,B000FVMSMM,"I've been doing Oriental dance for 6 years, and recently became very interested in specifically Turkish style dance.  Modern Egyptian style is much more common to see in the U.S., but I love the fun nature of Turkish style.  It's just hard to find anyone who teaches the authentic dance.  Artemis Mourat is a well known Turkish dance historian, and I like her breakdown of the Turkish rhythm.  It can be difficult if you're not musically inclined, but it can be learned with practice.  She gives good steps and combinations to use while you're getting used to the rhythm.  This is not a DVD for beginners, as she doesn't really break down the movements.  It's great for an intermediate/advanced dancer.  I'm glad she went over hand gestures as well, although I wish there was a little bit more on that.  All in all, a good DVD for any belly dancer's collection.",1332892800,,861,4.6490066225165565
8127390,4,B000FVMSMM,"This video gives you a nice hand warm-up and all around exercises to enhance your choreographies. Fahtiem is this sweet soft-voiced dancer with incredibly graceful arms that shares some of those movements and how to incorporate them in your dance. If you are looking for fancy postures, this is not for you, but if you want a good arm and hand workout this is it. The video also includes body warm-up and ways to showcase the use of the movements learned. She sums it up with a small performance that showcases her arms and it does look very nice. Its very pricey for what you get but its better than any other video out there as far as I have researched.",1317254400,,655,4.421487603305785
8127391,5,B000FVMSMM,"This is probably one of my favorite belly dance dvds ever! To me its better than most dvds I've used because Artemis goes over everything so thoroughly, even explaining some of the history of Turkish belly dance. With her, it's almost like you've stepped into an actual classroom. Too many teachers on dvds rush through things too much. With Artemis she sets up everything and explains detail so well that it's easy to learn. I've fallen in love with Turkish belly dance now. Bravo!",1304294400,3,482,4.75
8127392,3,B000FVMSMM,"Elizabeth has a great teaching style and is very pleasant to listen to and watch.

Moves are well demonstrated and DVD has good sections etc.

My only criticism is that compared to some other good DVD's I have bought this was over double the price yet not as comprehensive as say Jehan, Jenna or Autumn or Leila.

So whilst an ok DVD I feel it is overpriced - really should be about $13

Good if you want understanding and insight into Turkish Style.",1293926400,8,450,4.385542168674699
8127393,4,B000FVMSMM,Artemis Mourat is very detailed in her descriptions and background.  Good explanation of the differences between Turkish and Egyptian belly dance.  Lots of information is packed into this DVD.  Highly recommended.,1241308800,2,213,5.806451612903226
8127394,5,B000FVMSMM,Hands are so important when expressing the dance. This dvd  helps show case the body and can direct attention to make your dance more captivating. Fateim is clear and gentle in her approach. A must for all dancers.,1235779200,,214,4.631578947368421
