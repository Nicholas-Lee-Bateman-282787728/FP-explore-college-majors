7794536,4,0973000929,"We enjoyed watching this DVD. I bought it especially for my grandchildren to watch,  as we are direct descendants of Alfred the Great. It is more for teenagers and adults.",1360972800,2,171,4.7
7794537,5,0973000929,Enjoyed this documentary on ALFRED and all the althel's.  A really interesting part of history and includes the accomplishments of this king. He was ahead of his time in many of his initiatives.,1358985600,2,194,4.878787878787879
7794538,4,0973000929,"This is a very good video account of one of England's greatest kings.  The video is well done, the costumes authentic and the acting as good as any I have seen in DVD documentaries  of this kind.  I found the commentary to be informative and it conformed to what I have read about the subject.  Serious scholars may find things to pick at but this isn't intended for that audience and the running time is only 50 minutes.  If I have any criticism I wish it were longer and more detailed.",1357516800,4,487,4.3076923076923075
7794539,5,0973000929,This is a good documentation that fills in the gap that most Student from the government will never find out about the history of how one king saved the English language and made a Kingdom that would rule the whole Island of England.,1322870400,3,233,4.441860465116279
7794540,2,0973000929,"I recently saw a work in this series on King Charles and thought, ""This will be really helpful for American and British students in history classes.""  That thought arose because the British succession slightly after Queen Elizabeth I is rather important.  Maybe British schools would feel that all British royalty are important.  However, a king in the 800s would not come up in American classrooms.  Little is said about figures during the Dark Ages in this country's history courses.

There's one point for which this documentary must be given credit: I've heard that Vikings raided the British Isles and that island dwellers fought back.  This work doesn't just describe those as skirmishes; it portrays them as true battles in which there were leaders and strategy.  This work was much more about the battles that King Albert fought than about King Albert's life principally.

This may not please period piece lovers.  What's great about period pieces is how ornate, and almost impressionistic, they make past cultures and times seem.  Notice how ""Hero"" showed the ornate products of ancient China while few films focus on the masses wearing blue, Maoist uniforms.  Works show all the powder and wigs and silk of 1700s France, but rarely do you see the poverty and starkness of France circa 1000, for example.  This hurts this documentary:  the outfits are drab; the actors are wearing dirty clothes; the landscapes seem stark.  This is probably very accurate and accuracy is important in documentary.  Still, this work may bee too dull for many viewers.  If one compares the fabulous life of Queen Victoria to the drab life of King Albert, surely viewers will flock to see works on the former ruler much more than they would the latter.",1211068800,4,1741,4.972318339100346
