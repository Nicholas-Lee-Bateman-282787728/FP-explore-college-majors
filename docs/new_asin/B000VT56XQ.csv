2952833,5,B000VT56XQ,"I want to Thank Eagle Rock and the Montreux  people for making as many of these performances now possible on DVD...Keep them coming... That being said....This is simply One Hell of a First Performance there for Jonny...He was only 18...and already released 2 Major Label  Platinum Albums...And supported 2 World Tours for Major Artists,  The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith...LIE TO ME, his Debut at 16, went Platinum+ and spent 19 weeks in the Top Spot on the Blues Charts...I knew he came out of the gate HOT but these last few years I'd not kept track of him...Then when I started buying some of the Montreux DVD's of Live Shows I saw this one...And SEEING him perform this show was Dynamite, not to be Missed...I have SRV's 1st and 2nd performances there, the first in 1983 and then in 1985...Stevie casually reminded the fans of a few Boos mixed among the cheers that first performance and there were some...In contrast, there are 9 songs in total performed on this DVD...and while it is Solid from the start...his performance of { A QUITTER NEVER WINS} is simply captivating...and it garnered a Standing Ovation from the crowd as well... This is worth having if you want to experience Jonny LIVE....BUT...I don't know what the reason is, but it appears as though you can buy it on DVD, but not on CD...the same issue I ran across trying to find Clapton: Live at Hyde Park....DVD, No CD...ANOTHER Classic Live Performance from the late 1990's...Anyone know Why ??? BUY BOTH DVDS...",1430956800,,1483,4.762645914396887
2952834,5,B000VT56XQ,Very good!  Jonny was at his best when first starting out.  I thought his music  was just so mature for a young man of his age.  His execution of these very mature subjects was 'on point'!!,1425513600,,189,4.166666666666667

2952840,5,B000VT56XQ,"I know, the performances are only about an hour at these Montreau shows, so it's not the fault of the DVD itself, although there are zero extras, a big disappointment for me. DVD's can fit so much more content than an hour long show, I wish at least something extra were included. This was a fantastic performance by Lang, and it's well worth adding to one's collection, but this was my 1st Lang purchase. I kind of wish I'd started with something offering a bit more content to begin with and added this later.",1391299200,,511,4.446808510638298

2952849,4,B000VT56XQ,"Jonny Lang has been doing the blues for many years, even tho, Jonny, himself is a young man. Has paid his dues and one of the top blues man around. Among many blues legends, as he also is consider to be. A legend in his own rights........this video captures a legends in person.",1367280000,,278,4.264150943396227
2952850,5,B000VT56XQ,"If you like blues guitar, and enjoy watching the artist too, you won't regret buying this DVD. Great look back at how Jonny Lang started out, and why he belongs on anyone's list of best blues artists. Fabulous vocalist too!",1367020800,,223,4.6
2952851,5,B000VT56XQ,A soulful collection of Jonny at his finest. Raw and unwaivering that showcases his talent and undeniable stage presence. A must see for all fans of this talented blues man.,1362182400,,173,4.8

2952854,5,B000VT56XQ,Johnny Lang is always a good show. The Montreux gigs are usually outstanding. Lang is passionate as always which makes his music stand above the rest.,1348012800,,150,4.8076923076923075
2952855,4,B000VT56XQ,"This serves as the early part of Johnny's carrer. I think he could have put a few more songs on the DVD but I realize he only had two albums out at the time. All in all a good DVD. Arrived on time and no problems with the seller, would reccomend.",1338336000,,246,3.843137254901961
2952856,2,B000VT56XQ,The recording team was very amateur. Boring coverage of the band. The audience did not get into the music that I thought was wonderful. How odd,1326326400,,143,4.538461538461538
2952857,3,B000VT56XQ,"Having watched him for the first time with Eric Clapton and friends in the second cross roads DvD, it was a case of searching the web to look for one of his DvD's and this is great.",1295481600,,181,3.918918918918919
2952858,5,B000VT56XQ,"A professionally filmed and produced live concert video which captures the charisma and talent of the young Jonny Lang. Outstanding record of the ""early-mid phase"" of his growth and evolution as an adept and much admired guitarist/musician.",1293494400,,240,5.513513513513513
2952859,3,B000VT56XQ,"Although this performance is heartfelt it's obvious he's a rookie at both blues singing and performing. A rookie blues I guess you could say. I found also his vocals to be terribly slurred, not the least understandable, which may be OK for some but not for me. The video quality is adequate, the audio fair at best.",1292284800,,315,4.543859649122807
2952860,5,B000VT56XQ,I have been a fan for 15 years now and have seen Jonny in concert a few times...but this is the best show I've seen. I want more of this Jonny.,1276300800,,143,3.6451612903225805
2952861,4,B000VT56XQ,"A good performance by Jonny and his old band.  Why he chose to omit his signature song "" I Am "" is beyond me.  I've seen him perform numerous times over the years and that song is usually saved for the encore.  Too bad it was left out of this DVD.",1273190400,,247,3.803921568627451
2952862,5,B000VT56XQ,"Jonny comes out hard and strong on his first song setting a hard to follow standard, but keeps out doing the previous song over and over. Hard to believe a person of that age could portray such soul and feeling into their music. This is a well recorded live take on Jonny's early career. The audio is extremely good and matches their performance. The back up band is well polished, and any one of them could be his father as far as age difference goes. Kind of different to see the reversed age difference. Any one who likes the blues of Joe Bonamassa, Rory Gallagher, SRV, or Gov't Mule will surly appreciate this performance. Highly recommended.

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Bands that wish to have there performances recognized and recorded should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it.",1264982400,,1227,4.693023255813953
2952863,5,B000VT56XQ,"This DVD has great sound, color.  I'm not a fan of concert videos that move fast from one shot to another.  I get dizzy!!  This production makes it easy to sit back and actually enjoy an evening with Jonny Lang.  He is a pleasure to watch and listen to.  I had the pleasure of seeing him, in Rochester, NY, recently.  This video brings it all home, again.  Thanks!!",1262476800,,365,4.279411764705882
2952864,2,B000VT56XQ,I saw him on the Jay Leno show and I liked his performance very much.  I understand that this DVD was from 10 years ago but I was still a bit disappointed.,1242691200,,155,3.84375
2952865,5,B000VT56XQ,Fabulous DVD of this young talent. Superior audio / video quality on this recording of Jonny and his outstanding band of professionals,1235692800,,134,5.136363636363637
2952866,5,B000VT56XQ,"I just bought this a couple of weeks ago, I finally got the chance to sit down and watch it. Wow what a mind blower, this young man (18 at the time) plays and sings with the conviction of a veteran artist. His guitar playing skills are superb, along with his vocals. This is a must for blues or rock fans, he comes off as very much in control of his game. The other guitarist is no slouch either, he also does some fantastic solos. The drummer is excellent along with his bass player, his band is very tight and of very high quality. The songs are all great, they were good choices for this show. The DTS surround adds a lot to the enjoyment of the show, this is one I bought after reading other reviews. The other reviewers hit the nail on the head with this one, just buy it you will love it.",1233964800,13,794,4.096153846153846
2952867,5,B000VT56XQ,"Since the first time I saw him perform was two years ago, it was great to be able to see this performance from the past.  All the energy and passion he shows now was there back then.  He's still amazing to see in person and the concerts are still fantastic!  This proves the point that you can be a Christian and still be an amazing performer.",1228089600,,343,4.166666666666667
2952868,5,B000VT56XQ,If you ever get the chance to see Jonny Lang live you will never forget it. I have been looking for this DVD for a long time and it is really good. Jonny is in his prime and it is a very good show. The camera work is great and the music is great. If you like great blues music buy this DVD!!!!,1228003200,3,293,3.6666666666666665
2952869,4,B000VT56XQ,"This serves as agreat testament to the early part of Johnny's carrer. The timing is just after the release of his second album; I have always felt that his first two albums were his best by far. If you liked early Johnny, this one's for you !",1227312000,2,242,4.170212765957447

2952871,5,B000VT56XQ,Jonny's strength is certainly in live performance and this DVD is a fantastic representation of that.,1224028800,2,101,5.375
2952872,5,B000VT56XQ,I have seen Jonny Lang 3 times and each time... he was just amazing. This was a DVD I preordered as soon as I heard it was coming out. Well worth the wait. Most excellent!!,1223769600,2,172,3.942857142857143
2952873,5,B000VT56XQ,"I have always wondered why jonny lang never put out a dvd. well now he has  9 years after his concert in montreaux. i only wish he had played more songs and maybe did a bonus feature with background footage of him rehearsing. he's a great guitarist and he was great way before a certain john mayer probably even picked up a guitar for the 1st time and jonny is still younger than mayer. mayer thinks he's the only good guitarist in the world. also, jonny has always remained humble the only thing is he switched to christian music so we won't get to see any more blues rock dvds.so this may be your only chance to catch him. it's worth it.",1221436800,8,639,4.237704918032787
2952874,5,B000VT56XQ,"To bad seeing him live is not like this anymore...
Jonny has found God.... Music has completely changed
still plays a few of the hits, but unless you are REALLY into bland gospel music pass on seeing him live.",1221004800,3,209,4.384615384615385
2952875,5,B000VT56XQ,"Ive been a fan of Jonny for a while now, and I have a video tape of this concert that I bought more than 5 years ago. I always thought this concert was the best ever, and I wasn't surprise when I learned that it was the concert chosen to be released on DVD... unfortunately, it looks like Eagle Rock entertainment has some problems with this dvd...

3187350,4,B000VT56XQ,"If you like a great rockin blues show this is it, Jonny plays with everything he has and more. Great audio and video",1350000000,,116,4.086956521739131
3187351,5,B000VT56XQ,Johnny Lang is always a good show. The Montreux gigs are usually outstanding. Lang is passionate as always which makes his music stand above the rest.,1348012800,,150,4.8076923076923075
3187352,4,B000VT56XQ,"This serves as the early part of Johnny's carrer. I think he could have put a few more songs on the DVD but I realize he only had two albums out at the time. All in all a good DVD. Arrived on time and no problems with the seller, would reccomend.",1338336000,,246,3.843137254901961
3187353,2,B000VT56XQ,The recording team was very amateur. Boring coverage of the band. The audience did not get into the music that I thought was wonderful. How odd,1326326400,,143,4.538461538461538
3187354,3,B000VT56XQ,"Having watched him for the first time with Eric Clapton and friends in the second cross roads DvD, it was a case of searching the web to look for one of his DvD's and this is great.",1295481600,,181,3.918918918918919
3187355,5,B000VT56XQ,"A professionally filmed and produced live concert video which captures the charisma and talent of the young Jonny Lang. Outstanding record of the ""early-mid phase"" of his growth and evolution as an adept and much admired guitarist/musician.",1293494400,,240,5.513513513513513
3187356,3,B000VT56XQ,"Although this performance is heartfelt it's obvious he's a rookie at both blues singing and performing. A rookie blues I guess you could say. I found also his vocals to be terribly slurred, not the least understandable, which may be OK for some but not for me. The video quality is adequate, the audio fair at best.",1292284800,,315,4.543859649122807
3187357,5,B000VT56XQ,I have been a fan for 15 years now and have seen Jonny in concert a few times...but this is the best show I've seen. I want more of this Jonny.,1276300800,,143,3.6451612903225805
3187358,4,B000VT56XQ,"A good performance by Jonny and his old band.  Why he chose to omit his signature song "" I Am "" is beyond me.  I've seen him perform numerous times over the years and that song is usually saved for the encore.  Too bad it was left out of this DVD.",1273190400,,247,3.803921568627451
3187359,5,B000VT56XQ,"Jonny comes out hard and strong on his first song setting a hard to follow standard, but keeps out doing the previous song over and over. Hard to believe a person of that age could portray such soul and feeling into their music. This is a well recorded live take on Jonny's early career. The audio is extremely good and matches their performance. The back up band is well polished, and any one of them could be his father as far as age difference goes. Kind of different to see the reversed age difference. Any one who likes the blues of Joe Bonamassa, Rory Gallagher, SRV, or Gov't Mule will surly appreciate this performance. Highly recommended.

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*****
2.*****
3.*****

Bands that wish to have there performances recognized and recorded should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it.",1264982400,,1227,4.693023255813953
3187360,5,B000VT56XQ,"This DVD has great sound, color.  I'm not a fan of concert videos that move fast from one shot to another.  I get dizzy!!  This production makes it easy to sit back and actually enjoy an evening with Jonny Lang.  He is a pleasure to watch and listen to.  I had the pleasure of seeing him, in Rochester, NY, recently.  This video brings it all home, again.  Thanks!!",1262476800,,365,4.279411764705882
3187361,2,B000VT56XQ,I saw him on the Jay Leno show and I liked his performance very much.  I understand that this DVD was from 10 years ago but I was still a bit disappointed.,1242691200,,155,3.84375
3187362,5,B000VT56XQ,Fabulous DVD of this young talent. Superior audio / video quality on this recording of Jonny and his outstanding band of professionals,1235692800,,134,5.136363636363637
3187363,5,B000VT56XQ,"I just bought this a couple of weeks ago, I finally got the chance to sit down and watch it. Wow what a mind blower, this young man (18 at the time) plays and sings with the conviction of a veteran artist. His guitar playing skills are superb, along with his vocals. This is a must for blues or rock fans, he comes off as very much in control of his game. The other guitarist is no slouch either, he also does some fantastic solos. The drummer is excellent along with his bass player, his band is very tight and of very high quality. The songs are all great, they were good choices for this show. The DTS surround adds a lot to the enjoyment of the show, this is one I bought after reading other reviews. The other reviewers hit the nail on the head with this one, just buy it you will love it.",1233964800,13,794,4.096153846153846
3187364,5,B000VT56XQ,"Since the first time I saw him perform was two years ago, it was great to be able to see this performance from the past.  All the energy and passion he shows now was there back then.  He's still amazing to see in person and the concerts are still fantastic!  This proves the point that you can be a Christian and still be an amazing performer.",1228089600,,343,4.166666666666667
3187365,5,B000VT56XQ,If you ever get the chance to see Jonny Lang live you will never forget it. I have been looking for this DVD for a long time and it is really good.

3187366,4,B000VT56XQ,"This serves as agreat testament to the early part of Johnny's carrer. The timing is just after the release of his second album; I have always felt that his first two albums were his best by far.

3187370,5,B000VT56XQ,"I have always wondered why jonny lang never put out a dvd. well now he has  9 years after his concert in montreaux. i only wish he had played more songs and maybe did a bonus feature with background footage of him rehearsing. he's a great guitarist and he was great way before a certain john mayer probably even picked up a guitar for the 1st time and jonny is still younger than mayer. mayer thinks he's the only good guitarist in the world. also, jonny has always remained humble the only thing is he switched to christian music so we won't get to see any more blues rock dvds.so this may be your only chance to catch him. it's worth it.",1221436800,8,639,4.237704918032787
3187371,5,B000VT56XQ,"To bad seeing him live is not like this anymore...
Jonny has found God.... Music has completely changed
still plays a few of the hits, but unless you are REALLY into bland gospel music pass on seeing him live.",1221004800,3,209,4.384615384615385
3187372,5,B000VT56XQ,"Ive been a fan of Jonny for a while now, and I have a video tape of this concert that I bought more than 5 years ago. I always thought this concert was the best ever, and I wasn't surprise when I learned that it was the concert chosen to be released on DVD... unfortunately, it looks like Eagle Rock entertainment has some problems with this dvd... I can't wait to watch it in HD!",1206403200,5,380,4.08
