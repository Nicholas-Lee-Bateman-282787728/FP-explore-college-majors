2917299,5,B000UAE7J0,THE PROTRAYAL OF THOMAS CAPANO WAS MOST EXCELLENT AS WELL AS ANN-MARIE FAHEY. I REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE VERY MUCH.,1253059200,3,115,4.8
2917300,4,B000UAE7J0,pleased with this dvd Mark Harmon is a great actor didn't see the ending coming though,1252713600,,86,4.4375
2917301,5,B000UAE7J0,"The manipulation, the lines he used, and what they really meant. How he keenly turned the tables, the wording of his control.  Tom Campano's  mother favored him, so she help create the sociopath.  He could do no wrong, which makes him believe he is above the law.  That is the part that was so shocking , when in the end the mother chose her favorite again and dissed the son who had to tell the police the truth, or face prison himself. He had a drug charge. I believe he was on drugs because of the mother. So let her suffer when the Golden boy gets his.  She not a good mother, I don't care what kind of a family they came from, no mother in their right mind does this to one of ther children.  I hope the other brothers heal. Im sure their mother does not a penny left after paying lawyers for the golden boy. Read what the judge said at sentencing about him.
Another very good movie, Anne Rule hit the ball out of the park on this one.",1251504000,8,940,4.109289617486339

2917303,5,B000UAE7J0,"ann rule's and never let her go is a brilliant true crime masterpiece. this is the chilling story of tom capano....a rich, brilliant in law, charming and evil in his manpulation.
mark harmon gives a tour de force performance this is better than deliberate stranger. i love this performance of a man so evil. let me tell you how evil this guy is....he is very controlling. he lies to everyone women he see. he will lie to get to the one girl that didn't want him. he makes his lover buy the murder weapon so that he wouldnt be caught in a gun shop. he uses his brothers construction business to dump the body and has a freaky side to his madness if you know what i mean. these are just some of the evil that tom capano has done. watching mark harmon is amazing and this is a must have for your dvd collection
this is not your typical lifetime movie. this is a masterpiece. mark deserves an emmy for this performance.",1228348800,60,915,4.294797687861272
2917304,5,B000UAE7J0,"I love this movie. I watch everytime they show it on Lifetime, and I'm so glad that I found it on dvd. It's really worth buying if you like made-for-tv movies and especially if you like Anne Rule movies.",1228003200,18,203,4.230769230769231
2917305,5,B000UAE7J0,"I, watched this movie on Lifetime, and wanted to have the DVD to this movie. I, liked this movie without the commericals, and in the DVD version there is a pause where the commerical is placed; I, guess. All in all I liked this movie.

Enjoy!",1212364800,5,242,4.260869565217392
2917306,4,B000UAE7J0,"This Made-for-TV movie has a runtime of 3 hrs 20 minutes. This reviewer and regular Ann Rule reader thinks that is not long enough.

For example, the torrid tawdry Capano/Christine affair is barely hinted, although it was a focal point of the trial and fodder for the tabloids.

In contrast to the teleplay writer's wrongful redactions, the Casting Director is to be commended.

2917307,5,B000UAE7J0,"If you love Mark Harmon you really need to watch this.  If Tom Capano was anything like Mark I would have fallen for his lies too.  This is a heartbreaking true story of a young woman who falls for the wrong man, and unfortunately in this case the cost was her life.

Mark is marvelous as usual the perfect mix of charm and terror.  If you are prone to tears this may be a tough watch but I think it is definetly worth your time.  I just feel so awful for the real Ann's poor family!!! I can't imagine what they had to endure.",1196640000,11,526,4.019230769230769

2917310,5,B000UAE7J0,I first saw this movie on TV and liked it very much.  It follows the book by the same title very closely.,1417824000,,105,3.772727272727273

2917313,5,B000UAE7J0,I have all of Ann Rule's true crime books and this was a very good rendition of the book material.,1394064000,,98,3.95
2917314,5,B000UAE7J0,"I have read all four books on the subject of the Fahey Murder Case. I decided to get the DVD when I heard about it.  I really like Mark Harmon and had always enjoyed ""Cold Case"" with Kathryn Morris. So, that being said...it was a good decision...I thought...to buy the DVD, here on Amazon, of the made-for-Television movie of the Anne Marie Fahey Murder Case.

  This was a very worthwhile purchase, for me, because of my interest in the case, and because the movie is very well done, in 171 minutes! I didn't think that it would be able to cover as much as it does,  as the books cover,  in the 171 minutes used to tell the story. I was very pleasantly surprised!

  The story is a heart-breaking murder case, and in my own experience I would say to read the book or books about it before getting the DVD. That said, the story moves along smoothly, even with it's ""flash-backs""  that led the story from it's past up to the present moment.

  The year that I am writing this is  2014, both of the principals in the case are now dead, Annie of course, was the victim that these books and DVD were about,  and Tom Capano, her killer,  died in prison in Delaware... about a year and a half ago, so ending his ""Life"" sentence.

  With the exception of the two main characters and their families...the names of all the other friends and lovers in the story .... have been changed. On her last night on Earth, alive, going out to dinner with Tom Capano... Annie is shown wearing a black flowered dress ...when we all know that it was a light blue, floral, Laura Ashley. The other thing that was alittle hard to deal with was knowing how well known Annie was for her long, thick, curly, dark Auburn hair  ( or very dark brown ) and Kathryn Morris chose to wear her own short, straight, blonde hair,  I didn't like that lost effect that was a part of Annie. I tried to keep reminding myself that her hair was REALLY long, dark and curly!!

  Well, that said...I will say again that this is REAL story of a REAL young woman, her REAL family and friends and REAL boyfriend  ( NOT Capano! ) and this all should NEVER have happened.  It is a cautionary tale for all women/girls...that sometimes that Knight in Shining Armor may be evil and harmful to you! See it and realize what a narcissistic personality can do to those around them.

  One other thing that still makes me think....""what if..."" is the notes in all of the stories about this case, telling how Willmington, Delaware is a town where EVERYONE knows what everyone else is doing! Really? Yet no one knew what Tom Capano was doing and that he was pursuing anywhere between 4 and 9 women...and not a one knew of any of the others?

  I do believe that had Annie known of his ""other women""...other than his wife, or his threats to other women in the past, that she never would have allowed the relationship or friendship to go this far, and therefore, none of these books would ever need to have been written, or the movie...produced!  -----------Bobbi

  Rest in Peace: Anne Marie Fahey",1391126400,,3035,4.415162454873646
2917315,3,B000UAE7J0,"Thomas Capano has power, influence, and money. Anne Marie Fahey has a desperate need to escape. From Ann Rule, ""the queen of the true-crime genre"" (Philadelphia Inquirer), comes the shocking true story of a love that turns to cruel obsession, and the perfect man who a turns a womans life into the perfect nightmare.

Based on the New York Times bestseller, this movie is a cautionary tale of love, innocence, and family, perverted by an uncontrollable obsession.",1391040000,,463,5.012987012987013
2917316,4,B000UAE7J0,"I'm not entirely sure if this was originally a miniseries that later became this film for it's DVD release or if it was a television film all along (I know one of these to be true.)  Regardless, it is long and you'll wanna take the time to enjoy it properly.  Mark Harmin, who has portrayed his fair share of real-life baddies, including serial killer Ted Bundy, comes at us with another gripping performance, playing the minipulative and controling Delaware attorney Thomas Capano, whose popularity comes crashing down when he becomes the prime suspect in the dissappearance of his lover, Anne Marie Fahey.  This film chronicles Capano's relationship with Fahey, then the scheduling secretary for Delaware Governor Thomas Carper, his taking control over every aspect of her life, and the sixteen-month investigation between her dissapearance and his arrest for her murder.  Though we can never be sure what exactly happened as Anne Marie Fahey's body was never found and Capano died maintaining his innocence, this film shows us a chilling tale which the prosicution's evidence seems to support.  This is all based on real-life events that had individuals including then-President Bill Clinton  taking an interest (Clinton offered the services of the FBI to Governor Carper to help find Fahey after her dissappearance.)  You'll find yourself unable to stop watching as you hope for some form of justice for this young woman who fell into the clutches of this dangerous man.  Enjoy.",1381104000,6,1482,5.145833333333333

2917318,5,B000UAE7J0,I really enjoyed watching this movie. Another oldie I had not seen in so many years. I was all wrapped up in the story. Mark Harmon is great as usual.,1380672000,,150,4.033333333333333
2917319,4,B000UAE7J0,"I had seen this TV movie awhile ago...wanted to watch it again...It was interesting...l
ike to watch Mark Harmon in movies as well as NCIS.",1377734400,,139,4.6
2917320,4,B000UAE7J0,"This story is always hard for me to revisit, but this is fairly well done.  I knew Anne as a child (same age, schoolmates, neighbors, and my sisters were in Irish dance class with the Fahey's).  I suppose the movie couldn't be any longer, but it would have been interesting to focus more on why Anne was so vulnerable to falling for this psycho.  It's touched upon, but her life was absolutely littered with tragedy.  She was just nine when her Mom died of cancer.  Given that her alcoholic father had all but dropped out at as a parent at this point, she was effectively an orphan and was shuffled around schools and homes and basically raised by committee.  She developed emotional problems but often hid them well, as in many ways she functioned as a normal teenager.  She didn't lack caring and well-intended siblings and other older folks to offer guidance (with the Mulhern family doing much of the heavy lifting), but there wasn't much stability for her.  Years later, after briefly reconnecting with her father, he died of leukemia.  And, after finally getting some professional help for her depression, etc., her trusted therapist/friend was killed by a drunk driver.  It would hard to even make up a more sympathetic murder victim than Anne Marie Fahey, given the horrors she had already seen in her too short life.

So, my only criticism of the movie would be that the story is too Capano-centric, but I do bring in some personal bias.  And, in fact, if it DID focus more on her life, I might have found it too difficult to watch.",1377216000,6,1541,4.625
2917321,4,B000UAE7J0,"Mark Harmon is compelling as Tom Capano, a manipulative monster under a veneer of charm.  Kathryn Morris is also very good as the doomed Anne Marie Fahey.  Based on the novel by Ann Rule (and the actual crime), this is a well-told, suspenseful story.",1368921600,2,250,4.659090909090909
2917322,5,B000UAE7J0,"This movie is personal to me. I knew the Capano Brothers and frequented the same watering hole  (O'Friel's) and actually met Ann Marie Fahey several times and we'd exchange polite conversation. We weren't friends but were friendly acquaintances. This movie depicts Ann Marie's relationship with manipulating Thomas Capano and her ultimate demise. In the movie the actress playing Ann Marie is blonde, however, Ann Marie had long curly brunette locks, which threw me when I first began watching the movie... then I realized this actress had learned many of Ann Marie's idiosyncracies and quirks and executed them well. Soon, I completely dismissed the fact that she didn't look like Ann Marie, but she sure did her justice in her portrayal. Mark Harmon is so good as Tom Capano that it's creepy good. Mark gave an excellent performance and sometimes when I think about all the friends and good people I've been so blessed to know... I'll watch this movie again and take away from it, that Ann Marie was an endearing, happy girl who deserved better. Much better. Some of us who knew her can always rely on having priviledged, cherished memories, and that's a blessing that is comforting.",1367020800,12,1185,4.954773869346734

2917324,5,B000UAE7J0,"Once again, Mark Harmon gives a riveting performance of a psychotic killer.  As if he were not amazing as Ted Bundy, he goes above and beyond portraying the ruthless and manipulative Thomas Capano.  By all accounts, Anne Marie Fahey was an  exceptional woman, and had overcome a very sad and difficult childhood.  She was flourishing as a scheduling secretary in the office of the govenor Tom Carper, and had her own apartment where she could finally be on her own.  Enter Tom Capano.  This man takes advantage of her insecurities and when she finally says ""NO"", he kills her.  Based on the gripping book written by Ann Rule, the actors do a superb job in bringing the story to life on the small screen.  An excellent movie based on a true life tragedy.",1362960000,4,753,4.609022556390977

The scenes between Steven Eckholdt (the prosecutor) and Paul Michael Glaser (the cop) were believable. Mark Harmon, as Tom Capano, uses his looks and charm to con and manipulate  everyone, especially Anne Marie, the victim. There is a non-speaking cameo by the real-life prosecutor in the case.

I was so impressed and intrigued by the movie, I had to read the book. And I'm still not sure Tom Capano did it. Capano is depicted by Ann Rule as an obsessive planner with daily sheets of how he will spend his day broken down into 15 minute increments. How could he spontaneously murder someone? And if he had planned the murder, why would he murder her in his own home? And how could the dress she was wearing at dinner be found in her own apartment, neatly laid out on her bed without a bloodstain on it? And what about the fruit in her kitchen left to spoil?
