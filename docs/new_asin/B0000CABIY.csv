1916903,4,B0000CABIY,"I am a Leslie Sansone veteran. I also enjoy George Foreman's walking tapes. However, I do not feel this should be marketed and sold as a true walking program. It is more high impact aerobic dancing, something that I prefer to avoid due to a previous back injury. I give the video high marks and would recommend it for someone younger and more flexible, but not for people middle age, older, and those who are overweight or with weak knees. It's good but for people like me, it's too much.",1116979200,16,488,4.433333333333334
1916904,4,B0000CABIY,"As a ""Walk Away the Pounds"" veteran, I've been doing the 30- and 45-minute walk videos for some months, so I thought this video would be a snap. Wow, what a difference. As previous reviewers have noted, this is really a full-on aerobics video. Compared to the somewhat simplistic WATP series, it will seem very fast-paced and confusing the first time through, but don't get discouraged! The moves are repeated several times in various combinations, and after your first full viewing, you'll catch on with no problem. And if you get confused, do what Leslie always told you: just keep moving, even if it's just walking in place! The instructor takes simple moves which will be very familiar to WATP users (kickbacks, kicks, side-steps, etc) and makes them much more challenging. The sweat will pour, and you'll feel great.",1115942400,11,821,4.913669064748201
1916905,2,B0000CABIY,"Is this a powerful workout?  Sure.  Will it make you sweat?  Absolutely!  But is it a ""walking"" workout?  No way.  In my opinion, this is a true medium-impact aerobic workout.  I liked that there were 3 levels to choose from so you can customize your workout, but the title is totally misleading.  I consider myself to be in shape, but I do have knee problems, which were aggrivated after this workout.  Like a few reviewers have already said, you're probably better off not purchasing this tape if you have knee issues; there IS jogging involved in levels 2 and 3.  I much prefer Leslie Sansone's WATP series, as they're effective yet low-impact, and they involve using weights to tone the arms.  All in all, I'm somewhat disappointed I spent my money on this particular workout.",1104969600,21,780,4.703703703703703
1916906,5,B0000CABIY,"i loved this workout!! It made me sweat like crazy and i loved how they split the workout into three levels [beginners, intermediate, and advanced] in the same screen. THe workout was INTENSE. You can NOT not sweat. The program is very well-planned from going to a intense and then a little less intense and back again to help stablize your heart rate. Michelle is an awesome instructor and isn't annoying at all and is a terrific cue-er. This workout will take you less than 2 workouts to get the moves. THey're simple yet really fun and will get your heart rate up. This workouit will be one of my favorites for a loong time to come!",1083974400,12,635,4.435897435897436
1916907,3,B0000CABIY,"""The weather is always fine inside."" ~Michelle Dozois

Michelle Dozois has a ton of energy and if you are used to the Walk Away the Pounds workouts, this is going to take you to the next level. In fact, this might be more like ""aerobics"" than ""walking."" If you are looking for a challenge, you will find three levels to choose from. There are ""power moves"" that raise the intensity.

During the cooldown segment the music is not choreographed correctly and continues at a hyper pace while your body is moving into a more relaxed pace. It just doesn't feel right.

Will you burn fat while doing this workout? You bet! It is intense, there are three levels to choose from and you can alternate between the levels because at times all three levels are shown at the same time in a split screen format. My body broke out into a full-body sweat and I could feel the burn during most of the workout.

My DVD case didn't have the ""bonus booklet"" they advertise on the cover.

Disadvantages of this workout: TWISTY KNEE MOVES

If you have any knee issues at all, avoid this workout.

If ""Walk Away the Pounds"" is coordination level 1-3, this is coordination level 6-10. While you don't need any equipment, this is more like aerobics and I'd recommend this for intermediate to advanced exercise video veterans.

Fast paced, high energy, lots of creativity and a real challenge.

1916908,2,B0000CABIY,"I was looking to add a walking video to my collection for variety.  I was very disappointed with this one.  If you're coordinated, can do aerobics with no problem, don't need advanced cuing, this could be for you! There's 3 women that each do a different level of the same exercise which is cool.  But if you're like me, you need basic steps and no fancy footwork, just add some easy side stepping, kicks, knee lifts and need warnings-- pass it.  I like Michelle, I have one of her other DVD's for Pilates, but I couldn't do this one comfortably. She didn't even explain any of her fancy movements.  I'll stick with Leslie Sansone.  And funny thing, one of Michelle's exercisers is also in Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds! :)",1083369600,8,731,4.541984732824427
1916909,5,B0000CABIY,"This walking DVD is the best one I have ever purchased!  I have used the ""Walk Away the Pounds"" DVDs, but always felt like they were not challenging enough.  This Prevention DVD took my walking to the next level!  Being able to choose between three modifications of the same exercise was also wonderful!  Buy this DVD--you won't regret it!",1080086400,6,339,4.694915254237288
1916910,5,B0000CABIY,"I'm English, and I wanted to add some American fitness DVDs to my collection; this was one of those I randomly chose.  It's great, it really is.  Another reviewer suggests it is more like aerobics than walking, and I guess there is some truth in that (though nothing is complicated or dancy), but it is an EXCELLENT low impact, high sweat programme that is loads of fun.  I exercise at least 6 times a week so I do the highest of the three levels on offer but the other two are good as well, and make this suitable for most ages and fitness levels.  I'd imagine it would be really satisfying as a beginner to start at level one and work your way up.  The cueing is first rate, and the exercisers, including the trainer, all look as though they are having a good time too.  I bought one of Leslie Sansone's programmes, and while that was okay I didn't like the praise-heaven peppiness and didn't feel I got a serious cardio workout from it (one for light days); this, on the other hand,is cheerful without being annoying and definitely burns off that fat.  Excellent value, too.",1078963200,21,1077,4.436548223350254
1916911,1,B0000CABIY,"I couldn't wait to try this video today.  I love the Leslie Sansone walking videos and alternate between the 2, 3, & 4 mile walks.  I thought this would give me a little variety.  I'm not totally out of shape, but I really can't keep up with the DANCING steps.  It's just another aerobic workout and I am so disappointed.  I love the other Prevention videos, so I thought this was a sure thing.",1077926400,8,394,4.27027027027027
1916919,5,B0000CABIY,"Great dvd. I have alot of Leslie Sansone walking dvds/ thought I'd try something different. It was from Prevention and I have other Prevention DVDs  that I like. I like Michelle Dozois as an instructor/ she is upbeat and keeps you motivated. I also like the pick your level of intensity during this walking workout. I really like this workout/ it's fun and you don't have to be a ""kid"" to do it like some of the other exercise dvds out there. They are just not meant for someone over thirty/ let alone someone in their fifties. i would highly recommend this walking workout. Thumbs up!!!!",1295308800,,588,4.547169811320755
1916920,5,B0000CABIY,"Another great dvd by Michelle.  Don't be fooled this is not your easy walk around the block! Michelle adds her own pick it up style. There are three levels so you can really push it or ease up a little, but all three are very challenging.  Prepare to work.",1289174400,,256,4.204081632653061
1916921,4,B0000CABIY,I have several at home workout CD's and this is really at the top of the list. It takes some getting used to seeing the 3 different intensity levels. It might be better to have two levels rather than 3. The instructor goes quickly but once you are comfortable with the format it really works well.,1287100800,,297,4.321428571428571
1916922,5,B0000CABIY,"This is my favorite all-time workout video. The very first time I did it, I found a few of the moves to be a little tricky, but they are super easy to catch onto. Having the 3-level option also helps you step up or slow down your workout. This one always has me sweating, but it's not so difficult that I dread it. The instructor makes things very clear and the moves are easy to follow. I highly recommend this video.",1270166400,,418,4.172839506172839
1916923,4,B0000CABIY,"I first bought this video in early 2005 and using it combined with sensible dietary changes, I lost 30 pounds.  Since then, my weight has fluctuated a bit and every time my pant size tries to sneak up on me, I find myself pulling this video out.  I've tried others, including a video by Jillian Michaels.  While Jillian provides some great strength training workouts, only Walk Your Way Slim seems to burn the fat and give me visible results within weeks if I do the full workout at Level 3 three times a week.

The instructor, Michelle, gives great cues and provides encouragement without being condescending or over-the-top.  This DVD is highly recommended.",1260748800,,659,4.79646017699115
1916924,5,B0000CABIY,"I cannot say enough good things about this workout.  It's an all-time favorite of mine.  The choreography is basic, yet not boring.  Michelle shows three levels of intensity throughout, so you can choose which level you work at.  Michelle is pleasant and motivating.",1208044800,,266,5.116279069767442
1916925,5,B0000CABIY,"This is a great workout and you will feel it when you are finished. This is not a WOTPs knockoff. This is more aerobic than just walking in place as another reviewer stated. However, if you find Leslie's workouts lacking in intensity then you might just love this workout. What I liked was that while it had some fancier footwork, it wasn't that difficult and I was able to keep up. There are also 3 different levels you can follow for low, medium, or high impact. I love the WOTPs DVDs and I get a great workout from them but I do have to add a lot of weight resistance to get it (ankle weights, hand weights, and a weighted vest). However, with Walk Your Way Slim, I didn't need any resistance to keep my heart rate in my target zone of 145-160. It's an excellent workout but much more aerobic than many other walking exercise DVDs.",1206144000,,834,4.318471337579618
1916926,4,B0000CABIY,I would agree the length would be trying for a beginner - but if they stay at level one (or less) they can complete the work out. For a beginner I would say this is a nice stepping stone for some of the longer workouts out there. I have been doing these type of vidoe/DVD for 15 years and as with all of them; what you put into it is what you get out of it. At level two and three I still can work up a sweat. I find this easy to follow with very consistant calls.,1201651200,,464,3.7448979591836733
1916927,5,B0000CABIY,I LOVE this workout.  It's easy to follow but very effective.  Some DVD's have such fancy footwork that they are hard to follow - at least for someone with two left feet like me!  I'm struggling so hard to follow what the instructor is doing that I'm not getting a good workout.  This DVD has great cueing and is very easy to follow - but it's a great workout.  I'm always work up a sweat with this one.  This remains one of my all-time favorites.  Michelle Dozois is awesome!,1189296000,,476,4.280898876404494
1916928,5,B0000CABIY,"When I started this video, I followed level one and took my time learning the movements and getting coordinated.  I am 61 years old.  I gradually added level 2 and then level 3 moves.  I also worked up to 4 times a week.  In the last year, I've gone from a size 10 to a size 6.  I love it.

1916967,3,B0000CABIY,"If I'd wanted a regular aerobics dvd I would have bought one.  The lower impact option is not even all walking and is performed by someone other than the leader so I ended up watching one of the background people the whole time. Buy the Leslie Sansone ones instead, even though she is a bit annoying.",1170374400,4,300,4.357142857142857
1916968,5,B0000CABIY,"This is an excellent workout video.  Yes, it is more than simple marching in place but all of the moves are one two steps, which is what ""walking based"" workouts are all about.  I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser and the level 3 workout get my heart rateup and gives me a good sweat.  Michelle is also an excellent and motivating instructor.",1165449600,4,349,4.507936507936508
1916969,3,B0000CABIY,"This is a moderately good workout that does create a good sweat.  It gives the heart a good workout and does push up the heart rate. However, if you have bad knees, this in not the workout to do.  There is a lot of side to side movements in it that made my knees quite sore even at level one.  Overall, it's a great workout for those without knee problems.",1162684800,8,356,4.057142857142857
1916970,4,B0000CABIY,"This is a very basic workout for those just starting.  If you are fully fit, then skip this and move to another of their dvds.  This is easy to follow and maybe a bit boring if you are fit already.  If you need to begin working out, then this is for you because it's a great place to start.

This is easy to follow because it includes regular basic marches and moves to more interesting power moves.  The good thing about this routine is that you can increase or decrease the workout's intensity because a lot of the time there is a split screen during the workout where you can see an easy or a tougher version.  The instructor is Michelle Dozois and she is outgoing and non-intimidating.  There is no toning section, so you may want to use this in conjunction with any other dvd, but again, this is great for beginners and maybe not so much for more advanced people.",1146441600,5,868,4.320987654320987
1916971,5,B0000CABIY,"To be totally honest, I cannot find a single thing I hate about this dvd...Now mind you, I've been a FIRM lover for over three years.  But every now and then you need to jump-start your workouts...I workout five to six days a week, this workout has been a WELCOMED change of past.  Love the music, bright colors, superb instructions, my heart is racing as I do level three throuoghout.  Love the ""twisting"" moves and I do have a bad knee.  ITS A REALY GREAT ADDITION TO ANY COLLECTION :-)",1143331200,11,488,4.388888888888889
1916972,3,B0000CABIY,"This dvd compared to some other walking routines is more of an intermediate level than say ""Get Moving"" by Madeleine Lewis or the Leslie Sansone routines. The instructor did not get me motivated. The routine is OK and I tried it a few times but it was more aerobic routines vs. walking. The warmup portion did not do a good job because my muscles weren't warmed up to do the stretches. The cooldown using most of the same moves was much better. I thought the set and the music were cheesy. Did I work up a sweat? Yes, but this routine would not be one I would return to over and over.",1142380800,9,584,4.223214285714286
1916973,5,B0000CABIY,"When I first got this dvd I got it strictly for the price.  I had bought the 10 minute solution DVD with Michelle teaching and because I had been teaching aerobics for 10 years I wasn't too impressed so when I saw that she was teaching it I almost didn't buy it.  BUT I AM SO GLAD I DID!!!  How much of a better instructor is Michelle when she has people to instruct not just a camera lens.  I loved everything about this dvd. The lenghth of time, the intensity, the fact that you don't need a lot of room (I live in a small NYC apt) and more importantly how much I sweat for only 30 minutes of exercise.  I love buying exercise videos but I find that they are getting shorter and shorter.  They used to be 70 mintues long (Jane Fonda!!!) then the went down to 60 then 30 then 15 then 10 and now 8!!!  What happened???  Do people really not have that much time anymore??  I have to do like 3 dvds in a row to simulate what I used to do for 45 minutes to an hour in a gym aerobics class the intensity is just not there anymore.  But this dvd is great because it has intensity of your choice no less and my heart rate is up there as if I am doing a step class work out.  Thank you prevention I am going to check Amazon right now and buy all the rest of the series.",1141689600,11,1262,3.9098039215686273
1916974,5,B0000CABIY,"I had read different reviews about this dvd and fully expected it to be more 'dancey' than I would like. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it is more than just walking like the Leslie Sansone workouts, but I didn't think the moves were anything too  hard to follow. And I can be pretty uncoordinated! The workout is about 45 minutes long with a nice warmup and cooldown. The instructor cues great and you get to see all three levels(from beginner to advanced) on the screen at all time, which I thought was great. I stayed with Level one simply because I don't like to do a lot of hops and jumps, which is what the other two levels do. But, regardless of your level, I think you will find this workout a lot of fun.",1140393600,7,723,4.3161764705882355
1916975,5,B0000CABIY,"What a great ""walking"" DVD!  It was a little higher paced, more aerobic than Leslie Sansone's videos, and definitely requires some coordination.  But after a couple of runs through, I had the program down pat, and I am not the most coordinated person on the earth!  As others have said, it seems to have a higher aerobic value than Leslie's DVD's, and yet, I don't have that worn out, drag myself through the day feeling after this workout like I do with some of the Walk Away the Pounds workouts.

Michelle starts with a basic move, easy to follow, and then slowly adds additional moves, one by one, until you have a full routine.  Just when you get that routine down, she will switch to another, starting again with the very first step.  The three different levels help you adjust the workout to your own pace; sometimes I vary between all three, depending on my energy level that day.

The tempo is quick, and Michelle is upbeat, but not too peppy - like some instructors can be.  She counts out the beat at just the right times to make it easier to adjust through a routine change.  She also is constantly adding or modifying moves to keep you on your toes, and it helps to eliminate the boredom factor.

I really like the warm up and cool down sections that are on this video.  This is the first video that I have found that truly stretches each individual muscle, carefully and effectively.  I am not overly flexible, but these stretches are great.  They are also easy to do, and Michelle explains which musle you should feel the stretch in, so you know whether you are doing them correctly.  Right as I start to do a stretch incorrectly, she will say something, like ""pull your hips forward"" or "" extend your tailbone out straight behind you"", and it gives me the exact description I need to position myself correctly, and feel the stretch.

It seems to me that this video vaguely touches on some of the other forms of exercise, such as dance, tai chi, etc.  There are some moves that border on moves used in tap, and the stretching and breathing and positioning might even remind you of yoga or pilates (although you are never actually on the floor).  Whatever she incorporates into her moves, she does it in a very subtle way, making it extrememly fun and engaging.

This is definitely the best workout I have found so far, perfectly balancing an effective workout, a great stretch, and a lot of fun all at the same time.  I definitely recommend adding it to your collection!",1135209600,15,2484,4.5291479820627805

I appreciate the fact that I can come back to this video, no matter where I'm at currently, and begin again. I enjoy the routines and feel that I get a great workout every time I use it. It can be hard on my knees in one or two places, so I've adapted my routine and just keep moving during those parts (lunges). I also try not to twist my foot while my knees are going another direction. Other than that, I think these routines are great. There's a lot of room for challenging ones' self, so it's great for long-term use.",1458345600,,608,4.205128205128205
7998395,5,B0000CABIY,"As of recent, I have started wanting to do high intensity low impact exercises. I have several walking DVDs and this is one of my favorite out of all of them. The reason is because all of the moves are doable, but it's not boring. This is great for someone who is at the beginner stage of being an intermediate level exerciser such as myself. I am not one to stick with exercises where the moves are too complicated to grasp after the first few tries. I have always exercised for many years but I feel that I am at the beginning stages of intermediate exercising because my schedule is so busy that I don't always get to exercise as consistently as I'd like. One month I might exercise 5 days a week, another 3 and then it gets sporadic, so I've never really had an opportunity to build to a point where I am an advanced exerciser, but when I am able to get back into my routine, I never feel like I am a true beginner. I always feel like I am somewhat of an advanced beginner, or beginner intermediate level exerciser. I hope I am making sense. Anyway, even though some say it's more aerobic style, to me it's like aerobics meets walking where you incorporate other body parts. That is what a good walking dvd consists of though... you don't just want to walk in place for 30 - 45 minutes and that is all you do. You want other parts of the body to benefit from the exercise too. I like this much better than Leslie Sansonne's walking DVDs. Leslie's walking videos are too easy for me. This one is challenging enough where I feel as though I got a really good workout, but not too complicated where I will get frustrated or spend to much time trying to learn the moves.",1445817600,3,1670,4.271293375394322

7998401,5,B0000CABIY,"I've done a lot of walking workouts, and I loved this one. Michele Dozois constantly changes things up so that the workout does not get boring or bland, and it is high energy. The levels are excellent for customizing the workout depending on how you feel that day, and I felt my legs toning as the workout progressed, which is rare, for me personally, with walking exercise videos, and I admit that I far prefer it to Leslie Sansone walking DVDs.

I have to say that some of the other reviews I read prior to trying this workout were wrongfully discouraging, and to those considering giving this workout a try, please do not be put off by the naysayers! My tendons are completely shot thanks to a bad reaction from an antibiotic, in addition to knee issues, but I had no problems with this workout. Whenever my knees started twinging--guess what? I dropped down a level or modified it. Exercise videos can be modified to what your body needs, so if your knees hurt, drop a level or lower the impact by keeping your feet closer to the floor. That is the point of providing various levels.

This is an excellent walking DVD that changes things up and is a great way to get in your cardio. I highly recommend it.",1346284800,,1209,4.46606334841629

I even have Chris Freytag's walking workouts. She's another trainer that puts out Prevention Fitness Systems workouts and they are good as well.

I have worked out to some of Michelle's other workouts. She's a good trainer. Her cueing is good. Some people didn't care for this workout, but I like it. I'm glad that Michelle had done a tri-level aerobic walking workout. This workout targets all level of walkers. Beginners, Intermediate and Advance. I like how they split the screen and show all three exercisers doing the same workout at different levels.

No, this is not your typical aerobic indoor walking workout. This workout brings the intensity. It has moves in it that you will not see in Leslie Sasone's workouts. And it does have moves that you will see in Leslie Sansone's workouts.

I recommend this workout to indoor walkers that like to up their indoor walking intensity. The next time that I do it, I plan on wearing my weighted gloves to bring the intensity up more.",1303689600,,1159,4.756218905472637
