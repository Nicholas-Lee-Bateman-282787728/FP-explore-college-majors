4979143,3,B0068RHSCW,"I'm always in the mood for a good ghost story, so I assumed I would
find one in DREAM HOUSE--not to mention the fact that the cast was
headed by Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts.

On the plus side, the snowy New England effects work to provide the
right atmosphere, as does an eerie background score that ramps up the
shock factor at every possibility. Unfortunately, there are very few
genuine shocks and the suspense stays at a very even level throughout.

The performances are valid enough too. Daniel Craig does a fine job of
acting while keeping his shirt on for most of the film and Rachel Weisz
has some nice chemistry with him as his devoted wife. The children are
played with simplicity and charm by two adorable youngsters.

But that's not enough. There has to be some logic behind the haunted
house story and the discovery that a family had been slaughtered there
years before. And when the final twist comes, the viewer will be
fighting off boredom to such a degree that the surprise factor in the
final scene will be a mere blip on the film's radar. And then,
abruptly, the film ends.

Surely, something went wrong in processing the script and bringing it
to a final resolution that bears close scrutiny. But with all the talk
of Jim Sheridan wanting his name off the directorial credits, I should
have been forewarned that this would not be a good, coherent ghost
story. Somewhere, a good story is struggling to get out.

To make matters worse, I viewed the film in a theater where two girls
in the row behind me never stopped chattering and laughing
inappropriately at all the tense moments. If the story had been really
gripping, I would have told them more than to stop kicking the seat.
Alas, they were immature and totally unaware that they were movie pests
of the first degree and spoiled whatever enjoyment I could get from the
film",1318032000,2,1863,4.5825825825825826
4979144,5,B0068RHSCW,"Will, who is an editor, is quitting his job so he can spend more time with his family in a newly purchased dream house. He spends most of his time locked up in his room writing. Rachel Weisz is the mom and they have 2 giggling/screaming daughters. There are things which happen in and around the house...the daughter claims there was a face in her window...dad finds footprints outside...the neighborhood teens play in his basement because this was the home to a man who killed his family. Now with the footprints...he is back!

In order to get information he goes to the local coffee shop and asks some cops stuffing their face.(I didn't write this stuff.) Peter Ward, the father, survived the massacre and everyone in town believes he is a psycho killer...

And then things escalate...

This is an excellent movie. We have seen various aspects of this movie done before and to mention it, or to compare it to another film would ruin it. If you like a good pyschological thriller with a twist, watch this film without reading the reviews or the box. Well acted. Well written.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1318032000,10,1105,4.651282051282052
4979145,4,B0068RHSCW,"Although the trailer led me to believe this was a horror film, it was more of a psycho-thriller/mystery.  It was well done and thoroughly enjoyable.  Daniel Craig did a very nice performance as the lead character in this movie--a good, solid job.  Of course, this is NOT a movie for your children to see.  The premise is about the murder of a wife and 2 young children, with the husband surviving.  But, let's back up a wee bit.

The movie opens with Will Atenten (ah-ten-ten  Daniel Craig) in his editor office, signing off on his severance package.  He has decided to spend more time at home with his family and write a book.  It is snowing outside.  He takes the metro train home and breaks the news to wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and plays with his little girls Trish and Dee Dee.  I got the impression that the family had moved into the house recently.  Trish found flowers on the porch this morning that were not from Will (which probably should have been better tied in or deleted from the film.

Soon after Will's retirement, an estranged husband and wife, Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts  neighbors) begin to look at him funny, as does their daughter.  Something seems so familiar about Ann.  Ann's husband looks at Will like he hates him, while the custody battle over the teen-age Patterson girl goes on.

When Dee Dee thinks she spots a man outside the window, and Will sees footprints in the snow the next morning, the plot begins to kick into a faster pace.  Will gets up in the middle of the night to see teenagers in his basement, involved in some ritual to commemorate the 5-year anniversary of the murders in this house!  Through talking to the teens and the police, and research, Will finds out that a woman and 2 young girls were shot and killed in his home 5 years ago!  The husband, Peter Ward, was also shot, but lived.  Peter Ward has recently been released from a psychiatric facility because of lack of evidence to charge him criminally.  Our story-line takes Will on a quest to find Peter Ward and some answers and reminds us that our perception is our reality.

The story-line was very good and well worth seeing, but it probably could have been developed better, into something outstanding.  Still, this was a very good movie and I plan to purchase the DVD when it becomes available--filmed in Ontario, Canada.",1318032000,17,2332,4.5907990314769975

4979163,4,B0068RHSCW,"This movie about a family that unknowingly moves into a house in which several members of a family were murdered (as we're told on the back of the DVD box) was pretty slowgoing through the first half or so (though it's only 91 minutes). It seemed like it was gonna be one of those haunted house movies that hints that's it's going to be good but never gets going. But then an unexpected twist at about the midway point drew me back in. It's a twist that reminds me of Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Shutter Island"" (2010) if you've ever seen that. But even if you've seen that, you probably won't guess what has happened in the house until you see it at the very end. I went back and forth on whether to give this movie 3 or 4 stars and would probably give it 3-and-a-half if I could but I'll go ahead and give it four stars. You'll probably enjoy it if you enjoy psychological suspense thrillers. Like other reviewers I thought it was gonna be a horror movie but it didn't turn out to be that at all.

The adorable Claire Geare as 5-year-old ""Dee Dee"" in the movie is a scene-stealer! Cute! Cute! Cute! Her sister in the movie, 7-year-old ""Trish"", is played by her real life sister Taylor Geare.",1466899200,2,1186,4.342342342342342

4979190,3,B0068RHSCW,"A clumsy, adequately acted supernatural thriller starring Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz.  The first half of the movie plods along with the grace of a 2 ton elephant, thanks to telegraphed suspense and little to no chemistry between the main characters. The first 30-40 minutes of exposition are handled so cavalierly you never get a full sense of the potential horror that awaits them in this house where multiple murders were committed.  Craig runs around the house and the town looking for answers to the crime that are inexplicably locked deep inside his brain.

At times it feels like a cheesy remake of The Sixth Sense, albeit with snow.  Anyone not guessing the true antagonist after 10 minutes should be severely reprimanded.  It's that obvious, and obvious thrillers aren't very effective thrillers.

In the end ""Dream House"" is salvaged by a fairly emotional conclusion that works in ways the rest of the movie don't.  3 stars for effort and a genuine attempt to entertain.  Not totally bad, but a serious missed opportunity.",1418169600,,1034,4.97093023255814

Instead, the creators said ""hell with that"", halfheartedly have some empty denials that are really just an excuse to drag out the big reveal for 20 more minutes, and then wrap it all up with a puzzlingly mood-reversing action-thriller finale.

It's about as suspenseful as an overstretched elastic band ..... Craig looks extremely bizarre in the role of tragic Papa - he is either overgroomed with a stunning six pack to boot - very GQ, or decidedly Gorky in his drab and somewhat rank garb ......later in the saga.

I enjoyed it even more the second time.  I started understanding some of the little hints that we're given and it made more sense.
This is a story about a man who quits his job to write the ""Great American Novel"".  He moved his family into a large old home with a lot of charm and a huge amount of repairs and updating.  A loving family who find out that the house they have purchased is the location of a multiple murder.  No one wants to be in a house that has this kind of history.  It develops from here that the children and his wife see someone peering in the windows and when he goes outside the next day he can see footprints in the snow.  It becomes really creepy and gets more and more interesting and puzzling at the same time.  So, enjoy it.  Daniel Craig is really good and so is Naomi Watts and Rachel Weisz.

The actors are all great, well acted.  This movie is a love story, a mystery, a psychological suspense/ thriller, a bit of a ghost story.  The more I think about it the more I like it.  I never saw the trailer, which I understand gives away one of the main twists, so don't watch it.  PG-13 good rating, certainly not for younger than that age. Mostly for violence, subject matter (with the murders) and language.  Also has a little suggestive sex scene with the husband and wife, she sits atop his prone body on bed and they giggle and such as a married couple may do, so up to you if that would bother you for your kid to see. I would think not a big deal for a 14 year old (certainly less suggestive than any of the teen vampire/werewolf movies).",1392940800,,923,4.319767441860465

This is a story primarily viewed through the perspective of the main character and executed in a brilliantly conceived manner that never proves boring, inane or cliche.

The acting was good, directing good, script and story excellent.  Unfortunately I can't discuss the most fascinating aspect of the movie without spoiling the entire premise.  So all I will say is that it's well worth watching, presents unique and highly creative concepts, and proves to be a considerably spellbinding flick.

4979244,3,B0068RHSCW,"I think the missing element to his otherwise high quality production (acting and script are mostly top notch) has to be atmosphere. Whether it's horror or a suspense/psychological thriller, it needs to have a feeling that it transmits to the viewer with every shot, and Dream House just doesn't. (think Christian Bale's commitment to his role in The Machinist and you'll know what I mean)  It is shot like a commercial.  I don't mean a lot of jumpy cuts, but a smooth glossy detached finished feeling that is utterly wrong for the subject matter. The same could be said for the casting of Daniel Craig (and his too still Bond-like physique) in the central role.  He does fine with it, but he does not inhabit the character.  The audience doesn't inhabit the house, and one has to suspect the director is at fault for that.  I did enjoy it, mostly for the potential of the ideas here rather than the execution - recommended (for rental)  if you liked Shutter Island or the Shining (2 far superior films, but in the same ballpark story wise)",1375574400,,1039,4.619565217391305

However, events turn disturbing as they realise the house has a troubled past, and take an even more disturbing turn as their link to the events unfolding past and present becomes gradually apparent, with the help of neighbour Naomi Watts.
So far so routine, but the tone of the movie makes some radical shifts, mostly signposted fairly obviously early on in the movie, and by a half of the way in, the movie has really shot its bolt and the remainder is pure autopilot.  For all the tricksiness of the plot and the highly polished production look, there is something oddly mundane and amateur about the end result.  Still, Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts and Rachel Weisz are top talent, so I'm not saying give up on it, just temper your expectations.  Muddled tone and lack of creative energy aside, there is a fairly good germ of an idea here and the cast give it a try.  Shame the creative decision makers couldn't have had faith that the audiences could take something a little rougher round the edges, and smoothed the whole thing out into bland fayre.

4979271,2,B0068RHSCW,"Did you ever see a movie that had an absolutely perfect cast and an intriguing idea, only to fall flat on its face?

""Dream House"" is one such movie. It has the brilliant trio of Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts, and the core concept is a truly fascinating one... but it's also riddled with massive plot holes and contrivances, and capped off by an absurd climax. It feels like a movie that started off as a taut Hitchcockian thriller, but got malformed by studio interference.

As the movie begins, Will Atenton (Craig) quits his high-powered New York job. He and his beloved wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) have just moved into a beautiful new house with their two daughters, and Will plans to write a novel. But weird things begin happening around the house. A strange man is watching the house. A potted plant is left by the door. Libby and the children discover things left by the previous family.

When a bunch of teens break into the basement, Will learns that a man named Peter Ward murdered his wife and children there five years ago, but lack of evidence kept him from being jailed. Will believes that Peter Ward is stalking his family, and begins investigating the bizarre still-open murder case. But then he makes a shocking discovery about Peter Ward's true identity, which throws everything he knows and loves into doubt -- and forces him to seek out the true murderer.

It's difficult to summarize ""Dream House"" without giving away the BIG MAJOR TWIST, especially since it takes place right in the movie's middle. However, it is a fascinating twist, and it transforms what seems to be a simple thriller into a tragic Hitchcockian psychodrama. The entire movie is bittersweet, since even if justice is served, there cannot be a true happy ending.

Unfortunately, it also has more holes than a broken sieve. The entire plot revolves around the most pathetically inept hit-man in the history of film, who manages to kill just about every person EXCEPT his mark. And there are so many contrivances that parts of the movie will give you a headache. Why would the murderer wait five years to kill again? Why wasn't the house sold? Why does Will not have any family or friends in the area?

Even Jim Sheridan's direction feels lazy. A quick example: one scene has Craig returning home after discovering that this life has become a nightmare and everything he loves is gone. He huddles on the floor, and starts to scream. It's a beautiful, powerful scene... which is ruined by the stationary camera set up ACROSS THE ROOM, aimed at the back of Craig's head. It's like they set up the camera, and the director said, ""Okay, time for lunch. Uh, Daniel, just keep acting and stuff, okay? I'll piece it together when I get back.""

It feels like a good movie was twisted out of shape after it had begun. Honestly, the movie makes a lot more sense if you simply interpret most of the narrative as being part of Atenton's novel, since the weirdness only starts once he begins writing. Frankly, it makes a little more sense.

But the actors aren't responsible for any of the problems, because they're all really good. Craig gives a truly mesmerizing performance as a happy, contented man whose life spirals into a madness and self-doubt, and he has such magnificent chemistry with Weisz that it's easy to see why they married shortly after. Watts has a solid smaller role as a jittery neighbor, and even Marton Csokas does what he can with an otherwise flat character.

""Dream House"" has a brilliant concept and cast, but the plot is so riddled with holes that it collapses on itself like... well, like a condemned house. Fans of the actors will want to see their performances, but otherwise it should be skipped.",1363132800,3,3715,4.703076923076923

It may not be the most sophisticated thriller, but it does have twists and surprisingly alot of heart, the ending was sad in a way and kind of just melts your heart, which is something you don't usually get in these type of movies.

I thought the acting was spot on. Daniel was perfect as Will, he seems like a normal, successful man, who really lives his family. At the same time you can tell there is something troubling him. Rachel did a fantastic job as the wife/mother. She is just perfect. She has a sweet and innocent feel to her that makes you fall in love with her and care about her. The two little girls, who are sisters in real life, do a great job also. They have limited screen time, but they still make you care about them and want to protect them. Naomi does a great job also, you are not sure of she can be trusted or not, which really helps drive the story and makes you want to find out more about her.

I say ignore all the stupid negative reviews and be sure to check this movie out.",1355961600,,1095,4.184834123222749
4979281,3,B0068RHSCW,"First, do not watch the film's trailer, which gives away too much of the plot. But even if you don't, you will be disappointed with ""Dream House"" despite the big names attached to the project, including the Oscar-nominated director Jim Sheridan.

""Dream House"" centers on Will Atenton (Daniel Craig), a businessman who recently quit his job to live with his family in a quiet house in the New York suburbs. He has a wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and two lovely daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare). Will thinks he can spend more time writing a book until he notices a suspicious-looking person hanging around his house. And Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), a neighbor living across the street, seems to know a few things about what is going on.

Or maybe not. Written by David Loucka (""House at the End of the Street""), ""Dream House"" attempts to subvert genre conventions and create something new. Unfortunately, the film seems to have achieved only a limited success, either as a psychological thriller or a character-driven drama ... or whatever it is.

For the film tells its story very slowly without building tension, while laying out clues that only confuse, not intrigue, the viewers. The actors are doing their best, but for all the talented players and the palpable chemistry between the two leads, the pace is sluggish and the story - or the ""truth"" - is after all not as interesting as filmmakers think.

After watching the film, I read on the Internet a few interesting behind-the-scene stories about the film's production, namely about ""artistic differences,"" something that is not rare in Hollywood. So, where is the director's cut?",1353715200,,1659,4.935483870967742
4979282,5,B0068RHSCW,"This is a very good movie. Do not watch any trailer associate with this movie!

Will Atenton quits his job and moves his family in a nice house in the country side to relax, to take care of his kids and to write a book. Once he moves in the house there are many things that go wrong and people all around them are really weird. Finally they find out that the house was the place where a father killed his entire family!

At first they want to move out but finally they decide to go on with their lives, while Will tries to find out what exactly happened. He slowly gets it and we are in for a big surprise.

This is a good thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That is exactly what happens when you put a good story and several good actors together. You get a good thriller. Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts are just fantastic. Don't listen to the naysayrs on this page. Just don't watch any trailer and go into the movie directly. You will be surprised.

All the way to the end when you finally realize the plot.

The end is...sad but unexpected. Pay attention to the details and the names throughout the movie! You will also understand why the police looks totally impotent during the entire movie. Useless like Will keeps repeating to them. Why the police is not helping?",1353110400,,1301,4.293877551020408

I wind up fast forwarding through a good chunk of many movies, but this one I didn't.  I don't understand how it only got one star, it was better than that.  Watch it, if you are a Daniel Craig or Naomi Watts fan, Rachel Weisz is just ok.  Definitely a mind bender, you won't see the end coming at all.",1352246400,,565,4.224299065420561

The notion that something is not quite right lingers throughout the film, but you can't put your finger on exactly what it is. Wonderful performances by Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz as husband and wife who move to the suburbs in search of a peaceful place to raise their daughters and Naomi Watts as their neighbour. The viewer's realities are shattered more than once forcing a shift in perception to understand what you are seeing and what is truly going on.

From the artwork and trailer I wasn't expecting much, I simply rented it to enjoy Craig and Weisz. What I ended up with was something so extraordinary that I immediately bought a copy on Amazon, while the credits were still running. It's one of those films that as it fades to black causes you to sit back and say ""wow"" under your breath.

I won't go into details of the plot, let them hit you at the pace intended when you see it. I will however rave about the INCREDIBLE performances by everyone involved, especially the very wide ranging, emotional and I think Oscar worthy performance by Mr. Craig. Ms. Weisz is her usual brilliant self, but Craig really excels here. There's a scene... how do I tell you without telling you... there's a scene where Craig's character is confronted by a doctor... that's as powerful a few moments as I've watched in decades.

Just a warning... if you have trouble with goodbyes... there's a scene here which will have your grabbing the tissues, especially if you're a man. I'm a pretty jaded guy and I'll confess I had a few tears rolling down my cheeks.

HIGHLY recommended. A GREAT film.",1344902400,3,1282,4.536796536796537
4979287,4,B0068RHSCW,"Dream House is a bit of an oddball film.  The storyline develops at a pretty exciting and appropriate pace (well, starting around the halfway point) and you're constantly wondering what's going on.

I gotta admit something rather humorous however.  For the first half of the movie with all the people constantly entering the house as well as the children finding hidden back rooms by pushing on walls in the bedroom closet, I was thinking ""This house has an unlimited number of secret entrance passages!""  You'll see what I mean by this comment when you watch it.  It's hilarious that the family had no idea that the teens around town were literally partying in a hidden section of their basement.  It's not funny NOW of course- not with the knowledge that... well, I won't spoil.  The knowledge that you have to see the movie the entire way through to know where I'm going with this!  This movie was made with the intention of the second half being critically important.

Dream House definitely succeeds with flying colors right when it reaches the halfway point (45 minutes in).  I mean I certainly did NOT see the major twist coming.  Even though I remember a similar scene from another film, I can't remember if it was even executed in that movie as well as this one.  Once we reach the point of having an idea what might be going on in this supposed murder house (and it's just that- an idea and NOT an understanding of the entire situation at hand) our interest in how these events play out perk much higher (at least mine did).  A slow-moving and somewhat boring storyline has now suddenly become dramatically compelling.

The question then becomes, who *really* murdered a mother and two children?  Was it a complete stranger or are all the suspicions that the father did it true?  I *was* wondering why the father was walking around free and that the small town cops weren't really expressing anger whenever they approached him- more like mild disappointment and a desire to keep away from him.

Naomi Watts needs to stop being so dog on *hot!*  Seriously, what a cute face.  A face you want to cuddle up to in fact.

Overall, about what I expected.  Just a well told and somewhat sad ending.",1343520000,,2201,4.650259067357513
4979288,5,B0068RHSCW,"This is a well-made movie that has interesting, even touching, characters and lots of plot twists.

Will Atenton quits his high-profile publishing job (with GPH publishing) to live in remote surburbs with his wife and two young daughters, 5 and 8.  His wife refurbishes the delipidated house while he writes.

But strange, shocking things begin to happen.  The girls see a man spying in windows and roaming the grounds.  A posse of goth teenagers takes up residence in the basement and enacts death rituals--because, they tell Atenton, everybody who lived in the house was murdered.  The police refuse to disclose details, and refuse to help when the prowler shows up again.

Is it a ghost?  Is it a kidnapper?  Is it a serial killer?

Attenton fially finds out--to his shock--when he goes to GPH mental hospital to ask about the previous occupant.

Daniel Craig is superb as Attenton: open, empathetic, kindly, distraught, downcast.  Rachel Weisz is also great as his wife--ironically, the down-to-earth practical one, who always has sensible explanations for the horrors.  The kids are charming and believable.  Naomi Watts is terrific in an almost silent role as the neighbor going through a ferocious divorce.  Even the bit players are wonderful.  Rachel Fox, Naomi Watts's teen daughter, practically steals the show in a tiny part.  Michael Czokas and Elias Koteas are wonderful as the bitter husband and his (apparently dyslexic) employee.

The setting is also superb.  The subtle symbolism of the melting snow parallels Atenton's melting confusion and coming-to-new-life.

Even the makeup is good.  Craig moves almost imperceptibly from a floppy-haired gangly happy husband to a gaunt, hair-slicked-back bruised taciturn survivor.

I'm not saying there aren't any surprises in the movie, but instead of feeling intrigued and wanting to learn more I just found myself eyerolling at every new twist. As did the friends I sat down and watched this with, the most excited anyone got was in the first 30 minutes when you think there's a murderer outside the house.

After the reveal it just goes downhill, the ending was out of nowhere and not in a good way. It's not horrible to sit through one time but I can't fathom how anyone thinks this is a good movie. We've all seen it before. It's The Others meets Shutter Island meets Identity, the timeline is thrown together horribly and the story just wasn't very good to begin with.",1342051200,7,744,4.430656934306569

But of course its not as their new house was once where a few murders took place of a mother and her children. So naturally their spirits haunt the house and Will sees them.

Troubled by this Will decides to look into the murders and see if these ghosts are real or if they somehow tie into his troubled past (would it be a thriller if he didn't have one?). Also in the cast is Naomi Watts as Ann, the neighbor who seems to have clues to help Will with his search.

The film is fairly or rather very short, under 90 minutes before the credits roll. At first its decently paced, there's some good build-up and the way its presented it does make you question whether its imaginary or very real on Will's part. Unfortunately this good portion doesn't last long as it gets silly as it goes on.

Which is expected and thank god great actors like Craig, Watts and Weisz are included in this to give it some punch. But sadly the build-up doesn't lead to much, the twists are umm..... strange, not really chilling and get quite silly towards the end.

There seemed to be love with no strife between all the family, husband, wife and two daughters. They played and husband wrote, he kept a neat journal with pictures and words, phrases that rang with memory or depth, a good word is melancholy or maybe joy. The house is turned dark which is sad, it would have been so much more fun to see dreams of light keep happening, the tea party in the secret little room with the princess partygoers, pretending, using the tea sets they had, painting, fingerpainting, talking, laughing. The story was still good, yet it has the sadness and the loss. The characters are not fleshed out which is also not as satisfying. Excellent actors especially Naomi Watts.

Not sure why I was hesitant but I find that movies nowadays are not all that intriguing. They leave me flat and all I can say to myself is that at least it only cost me $1.30 to rent for a day. Well, tonight I finally rented it and I'm very glad I did. After having viewed this movie I was so grateful to have had such a unique experience. This movie was like a puzzle that kept me guessing throughout. I don't want to give away too many details because by doing so I think it will deflate the unraveling experience of a very clever story line.

As a few other reviewers have suggested, I recommend not watching the trailer. It only gives away one segment of the film. Be that as it may, I think this one crucial aspect of the film is better left as a surprise during the viewing of the movie. I was fortunate enough not to see the trailer beforehand. After signing online to leave my review here on amazon.com and watching the trailer here I am in agreement and would advise against viewing it.

Fans of Daniel, Naomi and Rachel should not be disappointed. They all do a great job and deliver dependably good performances. I am a pretty big fan of Naomi Watts myself. During the first half or nearly two thirds I wondered why she was in the movie in the first place because her onscreen presence was minimal. But as the story unfolds toward the end her character becomes much more prominent.

This is not a scary movie nor is it a thriller. It's more of a complex mystery that involves how our minds can play the worst of tricks on us due to horrible trauma. Sometimes this happens as a way to avoid, cope and/or survive the horrific pain of events that can completely tear our lives apart. There are also strong overtones of being compelled to face one's truth, love for one's family and finally letting go in order to move on. I'd like to go into more detail but I really believe that this is the type of movie to be enjoyed while knowing as few details as possible.",1339286400,2,2077,4.2798982188295165

Such as why did Naomi Watts not help out Craig when he spent five years in a mental hospital for something he didn't do? Or why did Watts' husband return to a crime scene where he'd effectively gotten away with the crime? It's one of those films that lacks the finesse of more tightly plotted twisty films like The Sixth Sense, and when you play it backwards it doesn't really hold up to any scrutiny.

I'm fresh from the theater. I just saw one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen - Dream House (2011), starring Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz, and Marton Csokas. I didn't know much about this movie before going to see it. I thought this movie would be scarier than it was. It has a couple of jump-out-of-your-seat scenes, but that's about it. I found it a little confusing at first, but then I caught on to what was happening. No spoilers here - again, I won't reveal the plot. Read other reviews for that. I'll just say this - if you like movies that have a lot of twists and turns, then you might want to see this one.

The acting is good for the most part, as is the musical score by John Debney. Rachel Weisz reminds me of Winona Ryder in a lot of ways. Naomi Watts turns in a solid performance.

I don't know what to classify this movie as. I guess it's a thriller. I sort of recommend it, maybe as a rental.",1333756800,,1023,4.156565656565657
4979310,2,B0068RHSCW,"Dream House

A decent thriller with a superb cast, 'Dream House' will interest the viewer until the final 15 minutes. The big problem is that the production rushes the ending and the observant viewer will feel that something is missing; a transition sequence that brings the viewer and the main character into the action of the final scenes. I felt that there must have been more scenes written for Jane Alexander's character that would have offered the bridge scenes necessary to allow the audience to absorb the direction that the plot was heading. To understand what I am getting at, watch a similar film directed by one of our greatest directors; Martin Scorsese, titled 'Shutter Island'. I do not want to reveal the plot of 'Dream House', but if you watch 'Shutter Island, particularly, the last 15 minutes, you will understand what I mean.

In any case. perhaps I have watched too many movies or perhaps my subconscious remembered the preview trailer, because I got the gist of the plot after watching the first 5 minutes. There was something off about the opening sequences that I noticed immediately and this was confirmed after watching the first scenes with the family and I began to compare it to an older film that starred Nicole Kidman. You probably know the one I mean.

Still, 'Dream House' is a good film that deserved a better critical reception than it got during it's original release. It is a minor effort by a very good director, Jim Sheridan. I do not know why he choose the direction that the plot unfolds before us. It is lame and easily guessed from the beginning. It would have been a much better film if the audience was in on the main plot points from the start of the film (I understand that the preview trailer revealed it anyway) and that the viewer  knew the basic plot line that the main character was so clueless about. It would have made a better film if the audience became engrossed in Daniel Craig's character discovery about the truth about his past and his delusions. And it would have eliminated the need to have other secondary characters speak dialogue and take actions that make absolutely no sense. For this reason, the film might be better if you watched it a second time.",1333670400,2,2218,4.67948717948718

""It has James Bond and his wife and it's about this house.""

All sort of true I guess. Anyway, I wasn't sure if I was getting a ghost story, horror story or what. Turns out of course it's a psychological thriller with a maybe supernatural element. The keep that cleverly vague and inconclusive. Which I liked.

I actually love these sorts of movies where it's not quite clear who the villain is or even what exactly is going on. There is a huge twist part way through the movie. One that I sort of guessed. But even knowing it didn't spoil the enjoyment of it playing out. And even then it still wasn't completely clear who was good and who was bad.

The photography really emphasized odd angles and shots through windows or from behind branches. That definitely added to the creep factor which was perfect for this sort of thing.

I don't have a lot to say about the acting. It's a great cast, but really it's all about Daniel Craig and he is great throughout. Showing the entire range of moods of his character. Happy father, angry husband, scared, grieving. It's just an all round great performance.

Really the only criticism I have is that the ending. The last three minutes really. Was weak and unsatisfactory. But despite that I'd definitely say watch it.",1333238400,,1395,4.515873015873016

It was a challenge to watch the remaining 40 minutes or so of the movie.  I wondered why I had never heard of a movie starring Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts, and Rachel Weitz as they are all big stars --- and the reason this movie was not publicized and I don't even think released into theaters is because it is BAD.  Only watch it if it is for free as a Prime member.  Do not waste $3.99 on this!  I was fooled because the first 50 minutes are interesting, but boy does it go DOWNHILL.

I had seen the trailer and read reviews, but I can honestly say the movie itself is well worth watching.  Even if you know the ifs, ands, and buts of the story, the movie was still an excellent watch and I would highly recommend this to anyone.

But its leading actor has pleased me with a number of solid movies, so I took a chance. It is well that I did, and after watching the movie I am perfectly satisfied with it.

It is a blend of psychological thriller and horror, and it is done well. It is not a B movie. The lead actor delivers his typically good performance, and the supporting actor and two supporting actresses--all familiar movie faces--also do well. And when everyone acts well, maybe that means the director does well too.

4979324,3,B0068RHSCW,"I am truly surprised that the people behind the production of Dream House went along with the trailer for the movie - it spoils the movie for the viewer! I watched the trailer months ago when the movie was first released in theaters, and was shocked at how blatantly the storyline was exposed, leaving the viewer with no sense of anticipation as to what may be the mystery of Dream House. I was so disappointed (I am a fan of both Weisz and Craig) that I opted not to watch the movie in the theater and waited for it to be available as a DVD rental.

Since I had already watched the trailer, I sort of knew what to expect and was proven right. There are no big surprises or plot twists for those who were unfortunate enough to have viewed the movie trailer. For those who haven't watched the trailer, the movie will hold some surprises, but not anything new in the haunted house and psychological thriller genre. The plot is predictable, and it is only the performances of the lead actors that keep the entire production from falling apart. Unfortunately, even the combined star power of Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts fail to keep this from turning into an awful mess of a movie.

The story centers on a man named Will Attenton (Daniel Craig) who at the beginning of the movie is shown giving up his successful editorial job so that he can spend more time working on his novel and having quality time with his family - wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and two young daughters. Things start to go wrong when Will begins to think someone may be watching his family, and then makes the discovery that his house was the scene of violent crimes involving the murders of an entire family. He also wonders if there is a connection between what happened in the past, what he is experiencing in the present, and the role of the attractive neighbor across the street (Naomi Watts).

The story starts off on a relatively strong note - the atmosphere (beautiful snow, an idyllic suburban street), the sense of suspense being gradually built up, but then it all sort of falls apart into a mess. The movie suffers from gaping holes in the plot, lack of credibility, and the sense of having watched similar plots before. There is a strong sense of the supernatural here but it can't make up for the underwhelming plot and lackluster writing.",1331337600,3,2333,4.55

It may be faulted for giving away too much a little too early, but the story and acting deserves more credit than this film has received.

I have heard that the Director and the actors hated the final cut of the film so much they refused to participate in marketing or interviews for the movie .... and the Director wanted his name removed.
That is a lot of animosity.

Maybe it's just his style but sometimes it felt like he was just having conversations with his self and frequently gave off-key, emotionless responses.

  His wife, Libby (Rachel Weisz) is excited he quit the job. The two girls will be happy to spend more time with daddy.
  later that night, the youngest girl becomes scared and wants to be with her dad. Will tells her it was probably a twig from the tree. He turns off the lights and tells her it was probably her own reflection she saw.
  The next day, Will goes outside to the window. He sees footprints in the snow.

 Also in the cast: Jane Alexander, Taylor Geare, Claire Geare, Elias Koteas.

The plot was figured out within a short time by some I know but I was fooled for about 3/4 hour and I've seen this type of movie before. However the weakness to me was that the ending was too rushed, cheap and far too improbable. It's like being set up for 85 minutes of decent storytelling to then allocate a mere 5 minutes to explain it all away. The acting was OK; not particularly challenging roles of a typical middle class family. Craig performed well; Watts didn't really have much to do; Weisz was more natural to this role than in Whistleblower but still nothing I'll remember a week from now.

The past dozen years has seen an increase in ""It's all in your head movies."" Most maintain the illusion quite well depending upon acting and directing skill and most importantly the camera angles and editing.

4979342,3,B0068RHSCW,"I've been thinking about this review for almost a week. I watched the movie when the DVD came out last week and it seems a hard movie to get a handle on, not because the plot is too involved or twists around too much but because the movie doesn't really leave a lasting impression when its over.

Daniel Craig plays Will Atenton an editor who is quitting his day job to write the great American novel. He moves in with his wife Libby, Rachel Weisz and two girls into their dream house, a picturesque house that looks like its right out of a Hallmark Christmas card. Then Will starts hearing disembodied voices in the walls, but discovers its only local teenagers sneaking into the basement and discovers that Hallmark house was the scene of a horrific murder, in which a father kills his wife and two girls. From there Libby starts ""knowing"" where the wife was murdered, and Naomi Watts as the neighbor Ann Patterson has a secret she won't divulge to Will.

Dream House isn't a bad movie, the acting by Craig, Weisz, and Watts is uniformly good, and even the story is good, but uniform describes everything well, it's a well crafted movie but there's nothing spectacular or anything that makes the movie stand out in any way. The twist in the plot is given away about half way through the movie and I was expecting another twist that never came. Dream House is like buying a suit off the rack, it looks nice and people will say it looks good on you but doesn't fit like a tailored suit.",1329004800,,1486,4.459558823529412

We have an Oscar-nominated director (Jim Sheridan), two Oscar-nominated actresses (Naomi Watts and Jane Alexander), an Oscar winner (Rachel Weisz), James Bond (Daniel Craig) and talented supporting actors Marton Csonkas (Lord of the Rings and The Debt) and Elias Koteas.  I agree the now infamous trailer gives away one of the movie's biggest plot twists, which pretty much spoils the film's finale twist.  Craig does well in his role, but the ladies' roles don't really have enough depth in comparison.  Csonkas is appropriately menacing but Koteas' role is basically a cameo, though a pivotal one.

Actor Daniel Craig summarized the film well by stating that things turned out great because he met his wife (Weisz)but the film, well, not so much.

SPOILERS:

""Dream House"" has a promising premise and an interesting plot twist that just doesn't come off. Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) gives up his position as an editor for a publishing firm to finally write his novel and stay at home with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz)and their two kids in their idyllic home. Their home is idyllic until they discover that a family was murdered there and they begin seeing figures outside their home. As Will investigates what occured he finds that the killer was never convicted and still lives in their community. Will begins to find out more and more disturbing facts about the killing as he tries to piece together what exactly happened and who is threatening his family.

SPOILERS:

""Dream House"" suffers from a lethargic first half and the second part of the film suffers from chopy editing clearly indicating that the film went through signficiant re-editing. The troubled history of ""Dream House"" included reshooting, director Sheridan being excluded from the editing of the film and, ultimately, trying to have his name removed from the movie (as well as the fact that Craig nor Weisz wanted to do publicity for the film they were so disappointed with the result) are sad given the talent involved. There's the hint of a good movie buried in this mess and the differing tones of the film.

The nice production design, photography and performances are in service of an overcooked turkey.

BLU-RAY IMAGE QUALITY: ""Dream House"" arrives with a handsome looking transfer and blacks are pretty consistent and solid throughout with nice detail which is an important point since some important scenes DO occur in the dark. Colors are robust and flesh tones accurate although the film is a bit on the cool side (a stylistic choice I would assume) for the ""reality"".

SPECIAL FEATURES: We get four featurettes which are, frankly, aren't long enough to give us a sense of the efforts that went into the film.

First up is ""Burning Down The House"" and runs under five minutes focusing on the conclusion of the film and next we get the complimentary ""Building The Dream House"" focusing on the production design which is interesting but, again, too brief. ""Dream Cast"" focuses on casting while ""A Look Inside"" is little more than a promotional short running around 2 minutes. We get the spoiler filled trailer. When watching this I couldn't help but wonder why Morgan Creek AND Universal approved this trailer which is compressses the film down to a couple of minutes and gives us the major plot points of the movie. Seriously, what idiot approved THIS trailer and what editor in their right mind would assemble it THIS way? The good news is that if you don't want to watch the movie you can watch the trailer and get the basic plot of the film.

""Dream House"" turned into a nightmare for director and for viewers it's a jumbled mess clearly messed with in post-production. The film starts off with promise but by the second act the film becomes a disappointing thriller that misses its potential.

4979353,5,B0068RHSCW,"I really spent some time looking over the reviews of this one, every single one after it was just released here on Amazon.  This was to see if it was one for me to even view, as I am not usually one to enjoy this genre in general. I am so glad that I did as they are all valid for their given reasons.  First off, I'll pass on the best piece of information I acquired; Please do not look at the trailer for this.  It appears evident to me that this is marketed as an altogether horror picture with a PG-13 rating (I didn't view it thus), I just don't see it this way nor is it when you view it in its entirety. I found it smartly intriguing, especially after viewing it a couple of times.

This movie appears to me as more a relationship story, suspenseful, a psychological thriller, and yes, horror-ish in parts.  There are quite a few added in classic horror tidbits, nothing off-putting for someone like myself who doesn't care for them necessarily.  It does carry along an undercurrent of the supernatural and you do start to question what is real and what is not.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film and owe a lot to the reviewers for their time in writing.  If I wouldn't have read up on this film from their points of view (all of their points at the release time), I would have never watched this.  It is marketed wrongly so it could go totally unnoticed while it is a valid piece of entertainment.  A chilling account that I was enthralled with.

Starting off with novel writer Will (Daniel Craig) leaving work and then returning home to his close-knit family.  Will's adoring wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) greets him along with their two daughters. The house is continually in a state of repair always by Libby and is something for you to be watching.

During one night Will discovers, unbeknownst to him, that teenagers have broken into his basement so he chases them off of his property, bewildered of their motives.  Things are getting more and more confusing, they are very dangerous for his once comfortable family.  It is around this time that he meets his neighbor across the street, Ann (Naomi Watts). He seems to feel as if he may just know her more than what's apparently seen.  There is also an interesting little cameo by Jane Alexander, that first comes into view at the genesis of the story.

I wouldn't want you to read any more than the character set-up if you already haven't had this movie tainted with spoilers or watching the trailer (Again, please abstain if possible).  One must really view this for themselves. I immediately watched it again and found that I had missed so many *tip-offs right in front of me to my surprise.  I will have to see this another time soon because I am still curious to find all of what I've overlooked.

""Dream House"" does boast an interesting and haunting cast that is not shy on chemistry in the two leads.  Craig and Weisz have a distinct and completely believable attraction which is now quite understandable. Along with the great acting, add Naomi Watts to this duo for one more.  There is just as much warmth, at times, to this as there are suspenseful moments and a lot of it if you have your eyes peeled all around and all of the time. These actors keep you present in the movie.  By the way, I loved the ending of which I certainly was not expecting.  It gave me a cynical smile in this taut and tightly stretched movie.",1328227200,10,3383,4.454545454545454
4979354,5,B0068RHSCW,"I watched the movie expecting another cliche horror one but I am happy to say that it was something different and better, although the main plot is kind of predictable, I gotta admit that it was a very touching movie with very good acting that gets you to care bout the characters. conclusion: a very, very good thriller that most people won't regret watching, but not a horror movie,if I were to describe it Id say that this is kind of a love story filled with some paranormal stuff and superb acting that will keep you interested and caring for the characters",1328140800,3,561,4.509803921568627
4979355,3,B0068RHSCW,"No spoilers....

The premise: Daniel Craig and family move into their Dream House. He has plans to publish a book and spend more time with his family, and seems happy - at first. Then odd things begin to happen and looking into the footprints outside and the noises in his home unravels so much more.

Acting in this movie was kind of hit and miss, and it was mostly because the characters were not allowed a lot of depth. The family itself, dynamic wise, did work for me at first. If it had been a different kind of movie, I could have seen them actually evoking some emotion. The problem is, when mixed into what is happening in this movie, you hit a wall. After those four main characters, you run into other people that are thrown in for plot effect, but that are not very convincing. I personally found some of the turns, when trying to tell the story, to be murder when it came to making anything tangible out of the other characters.

The plot, while it could be interesting, has been done. I'm not going to put spoiler in, i HATE those, but I will say the first guesses on what is happening will be right here. That is kind of upsetting when you have only gone 10 minutes into a film. There are two central plot ideas here, and the good thing about one is that it is revealed after about 30 minutes. The issue with that is a second idea comes up, dealing with neighbors, and it is equally easy to figure out.

Another thing you run into is the fact that this movie does not know what it wants to be. It certainly isn't horror and settles in as more suspense, but then turns and tries to be a supernatural thriller after a few. all that indecision really doesn't help at all.

I was not sure what to expect, but this wasn't what I wanted. It was mild, at best, and might fit someone's idea of a thriller IF you do not watch many films. I'm not saying it isn't watchable or horrible, just not really rewarding because of a number of issues. A weak 3 stars at best",1328140800,,1969,4.24
4979356,1,B0068RHSCW,"SPOILER ALERT

DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS

Jim Sheridan's made some great movies, and he's made a couple of stinkers. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of an all-star cast that includes Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts, Dream House falls pretty squarely in the latter category. Craig stars as Peter Ward, a recently released mental patient and survivor of a brutal attack that left his wife and two daughters dead. Unfortunately, Peter is not altogether well, and he moves back into his decrepit home, believing in his mind that it is still the lovely home he left, and that his family is still alive and well... but with different names. As Peter's past and his fabricated fantasy come to a head, the truth is slowly revealed. Unfortunately, I saw the twists and turns coming a mile away, and in light of that, the film simply moved along at a snail's pace, too stuffy to be gripping, and too obvious to be scary. As it stands, it's the worst film I've seeb for Sheridan, Weisz, and Watts, and the second lowest for Craig.",1328054400,6,1046,4.679347826086956
4979357,4,B0068RHSCW,"`Once upon a time, there were two little girls who lived in a house.'  Entering into the realm of this film written by David Loucka and directed by Jim Sheridan (In America, The Boxer, In the Name of the Father, The Field, My Left Foot, etc.) is more of a challenge than the viewer is ready to understand. The apparent story is so tightly written that all of the elements of the real story are placed before our eyes, but as in so many life instances, what we think we see and understand is a mirage: the story being told is occult until the film is over.  Similar films that use this technique include The Sixth Sense, Shutter Island, and The Others.  Sharpen your observational skills and this film will be extremely satisfying.

Opening with a New York City farewell party for writer Will Atenton  (Daniel Craig) who is leaving his high paying job to spend more time with his family, we soon find Will in front of his dream house in the New England where is beautiful and passionate wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and his two young daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare) are in the process of fixing up an old deserted house.  Some strange things happen - as in all good ghost thrillers -  and soon enough Will learns that the house has been vacant for five years because of some heinous murders.  A neighbor across the street - Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), seemingly estranged from her husband Jack (Marton Csokas) who is attempting to gain sole guardianship of their daughter Chloe (Rachel Fox) - visits and shares with Will some of the grisly details.  At this point the story begins to unwrap the real situation of Will's identity and the real history of the house of memories.  To share more story would be unfair to the impact of the illusion of this film.

Daniel Craig is superb as Will, and Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts are excellent, as are the supporting actors which in addition to Koteas and Csokas include Jane Alexander in a pivotal cameo role.  What appears to be an enigma at first is resolved with great skill.  A thinking person's movie, this.  Grady Harp February 12",1328054400,2,2103,4.558510638297872
4979358,1,B0068RHSCW,Spoilers. Stop if you do not want spoilers. This film is pretty much Shutter Island/The Others redone as an even worse psycho guy/ghost/who done it man unaware film. I did not even enjoy Shutter Island all that much and this was many many notches below that. This concept of a character who does not know who he is has been done enough. Please stop making this film unless it is with a very new unique twist. This film tries to twist it up but it's absurd when it all comes out. I figured it out way before the film explained itself.  Thank god I only rented this. There are better films than this out there. Go rent some of them.,1327968000,6,630,4.25
4979359,5,B0068RHSCW,The Number one tip I can you watching this movie is not to have any expectations. It's not a horror or a thriller. It's a drama. Watch it.

This movie delves into how we can become slaves to our grief and loss. I would love to give more details but the less you know about the better.

After watching it thought that the movie might be rather interesting but then realized while watching the movie with a friend who had also seen the trailer that the trailer gave away some very important facts about the movie which takes away much of the suspense. If you are one of the lucky few who hasn't seen the trailer and if you haven't read Amazon's review but are interested in the movie for whatever reason but want to know something about it before watching it then let me tell you that this would fall in the suspense/thriller genre...If you haven't seen the trailer and want to know a bit more about the movie without wanting to reveal a bit too much I'll just say that the trailer gives away who Peter Ward(a suspected murderer and potential danger to the protagonist, Daniel Craig, and to his family)is and how to find him. One thing that might put off some people is that they may find a basic fact about the movie hard to believe. While rating this movie I wasn't quite sure how to rate it. It does for sure deserve more than one star because of the cast and the acting and I still found some things about the movie interesting.

4979362,4,B0068RHSCW,"I've seen ""Dream House"" a couple of times, and thought it was a very good movie, despite all the bad reviews I've read. I agree with only one review so far, from geeksofdoom.com: ""a distorting and turning journey of mind-bending proportions, taking elements of...horror fiction and re-energizing them as 21st century psychological thriller...admirable performances [Craig and Weisz]....""  ""Yes, the plot is disorienting at times - but this is completely by design. While the audience is looking in a hundred distinct places to get a feel for where the movie is going, there are numerous elements hidden in plain sight that don't bubble to the surface until they're needed. The craftsmanship is the highlight and strongest facet of `Dream House', and make for a thrilling first viewing experience.""  I think there are many subtle hints that a great many viewers probably won't understand until they've seen the movie a second or third time. ""...while it is not perfect, it sure is a hell of a lot of fun being along for the ride.""  The reviewer purposely did not see the trailers because of reports they gave away important plot elements. I did see the trailers, and I'm insulted that they gave away so much.  No wonder the actors and director refused to participate in promoting the film. The studio, Morgan Creek films, must think we viewers are really stupid, that we won't pay to see a film unless we're told all the good stuff in the trailers.  Also, it makes me wonder what plot elements they removed in their quest to satisfy the US rating people to bring it from R to PG.",1326240000,58,1578,4.786764705882353

All the main actors do a great job. The main problem with this movie to me is that nothing seems to happen. The acting keeps you watching and interested enough, but eventually you grow board with the lack of anything. For a horror movie this is very slow and drawn out. This is not a bad movie, and the last maybe 15 minutes is exciting, but as a horror movie it is very weak. Overall, a very slow and drawn out movie with great acting. I have seen worse though.

I'm fresh from the theater.  I just saw one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen - Dream House (2011), starring Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz, and Marton Csokas.  I didn't know much about this movie before going to see it.  I thought this movie would be scarier than it was.  It has a couple of jump-out-of-your-seat scenes, but that's about it.  I found it a little confusing at first, but then I caught on to what was happening.  No spoilers here - again, I won't reveal the plot.  Read other reviews for that.  I'll just say this - if you like movies that have a lot of twists and turns, then you might want to see this one.

The acting is good for the most part, as is the musical score by John Debney.  Rachel Weisz reminds me of Winona Ryder in a lot of ways.  Naomi Watts turns in a solid performance.

I don't know what to classify this movie as.  I guess it's a thriller.  I sort of recommend it, maybe as a rental.",1319155200,3,1035,4.156565656565657
