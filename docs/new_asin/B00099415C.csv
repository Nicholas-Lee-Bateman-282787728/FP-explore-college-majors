2270508,4,B00099415C,"Well, from all the reviews I've read of this film already, despite the fact it hasn't been brought out yet, and I haven't seen it, it's gonna be pretty good, certainly.

An indie comedy, it sees the exploits of a man, pretending to be gay so that he can hook up with a girl who enjoys pursuing gay men (for some reason). However, there are multiple plot twists and apparently a slightly unexpected ending. But the main reason I give this film four stars is that it has Ryan Carnes in, who has recently been seen as 'Justin' in Desperate Housewives. In this film he is playing a(nother) gay guy, technically his first role, but everyone's seen him in DH now, so I guess it might not count. Whatever. He's hot.

2270513,3,B00099415C,"I somehow stumbled upon this movie and, before I knew it, I was watching it mostly because it was soooooooo campy and the stereotypes were just so obvious. This is an older film (2005) so I can forgive a little of the stereotypical stuff, I suppose. Half into the movie, I somehow found myself enthralled with it. Not in a ""This is an amazing movie!"" kind of way but in a ""This is nuts but somehow...it works."" kind of way.

I have no idea who any of the actors are but they all did a good job with a crazy plot line. The story line is that a straight college guy living with his gay friend is persuaded to pretend he is gay to get a girl who happens to live with a gay guy and only is attracted to homosexual men. CRAZY, right? The crazier thing is that this is not really a comedy. It is a drama for the most part and is serious about three quarters of the time.

Somehow, the acting made the movie bearable at least until near the end when things get a little crazy and downright dumb. Although the movie is dated and it lacks a lot, it does sort of bring to light some sexual questions and is actually ahead of its time in parts. Not to spoil the already thin plot, let's just say that the envelope was pushed in this movie. All I can say is the four main actors saved a hopeless plot and kept me watching until the end when I then wondered what in the world I had just seen.

if you're not offended by male on male gay affection on screen (No sex but sexual situations and one quick frontal shot of two males), this is a movie that is way different than anything I can think of. I am one of those people who get very bored easily yet I hung in there and actually sort of got involved with the characters to an extent. It's different and dated but it's not as bad as I expected considering the title and the plot line.",1476835200,2,1822,4.069637883008356

While I admit that homosexuality is still quite foreign to me I am thankful that films (art) like this can now flourish and that a new generation can eventually live without the horrible past hanging over them.  As the credits rolled, I said to myself, 'let the past be the past.'

This was a sweet film about the challenge each and every one of us must face, to be out and honest with the object of our love, about the potential for child-like play, understanding and a deep appreciation that can exist between people of different sexual orientations.  Above all else, this is a story about sexual exploration, self discovery and coming out with our personal truth, minus the judgement that has been the bane of our social existence for so very long.",1400544000,,859,4.594771241830065

2270584,3,B00099415C,"A good attempt at a gay themed comedy. Some of the acting is a little wooden, but the actors seem to have fun with the script. A refreshing change in the gay genre.",1391817600,,164,4.0
2270585,4,B00099415C,"The plot seems a little convoluted, but believe me it will make sense more in practice than in a simple synopsis. And one has to give a lot of credit to this particular bit of writing that crafted this tale since it did provide for a rather interesting stage for all this. The acting could have stepped up a bit to he just as complex as the story, but I supposed we can't get everything. A lot of the delivery felt a little wooden, but it wasn't entirely bad just yet.  It's just hard to determine whether the challenges were because of the core talent of the actors or perhaps their initial difficulty with the subject matter.

Ryan Carnes was sort of the highlight of the movie from a marketing perspective since he had gotten a bit of attention for himself for being on Desperate Housewives. I'm not a particular fan of that show and thus this was my first encounter with him as an actor. He's pretty enough to look at, I'll give him that, but not all that fulfilling as an actor to watch. Again, he's not exactly bad, but he could have been a lot stronger, especially given how tight the story is.

Scott Lundsford, unfortunately, was a rather weak lead. His only credit is somewhat decently portraying a straight guy being all weird as he tries to pretend to be a gay guy. It was a tad stereotypical and a bit of a caricature form time to time, but it wasn't quite on the positive side of the ""just okay"" line. Ultimately the male actors, I assume, were primarly cast based on their looks and how many people might find them hot. And I say this given I don't find Jim Verraros particularly attractive.

The movie had some great ideas, even beyond the core plot. I'll admit that I totally squealed with the whole odd phone sex scene - that was hilarious, uncomfortable and inexplicably hot all at the same time. And that really added a certain quality to the movie that made it so memorable - and perhaps convinced the folks behind it to create 4 more sequels that tried to play around with the core premise.

But at the end of the day, I appreciate the fact that the story was in itself rather fresh - or at least represented a fresh idea. We didn't have to fall back to someone revealing that they had HIV, nor was there a need for a scene at a gay club nor did we deal with a big group gay friends talking about their problems together. It was a pretty good story centered around a small circle of friends and their resulting misadventures. And it's sort of why it became more than a typical gay comedy - it was a comedy that happened to have gay characters, and that help things feel a bit more ""normal"" from a movie perspective - and yes I acknowledge the term is horribly abused due to anti-LGBT rhetoric.

Eating Out, and the end of the day, was a rather fun movie. The acting was hot and cold and the movie had it's somewhat slow and draggy moments but on the whole it was funny and enjoyable. Just don't expect to walk away being a better person or something - it's just not that kind of a movie.",1390176000,,3009,4.307420494699647

The normal ""OO LA LA's"" for the cute boys on the screen died off ""quick"". There's almost nothing worse than sober bitchy-queens with an itch for a good gay movie. So, we ended up watching Boy Culture, again (at least two of the group hadn't seen Boy Culture yet so we were good there).

Seriously though, if we wanted to watch bad acting gay males, then there blessed well should have been full triple-X action involved. Oh well. NEXT!!!!",1304726400,,757,4.641791044776119
2270617,4,B00099415C,"I have seen `Eating Out 1 and 2', so thought I ought to see what kicked off the series. This has a similar theme, in that in order to get your guy or gal, you have to tell a little white lie that turns out to be a massive big fat whopper of a lie, and yet everything works out. There is a massive split around loving and hating this film, and I can see whay but stereo types aside this is well worth a watch.

That is not a plot spoiler as it is just a synopsis, and in this film, we have a straight guy who pretends to be gay in order to get the fag hag of a cute gay guy that his room mate is infatuated with.

What happens are a series of situations in which things get more complicated and in some instances actually funny. This is not an hilarious film, but there are some great one liners and it trades on petty shock as much as the situationalist approach to comedy. That said the acting is well above average, the sets are very good even though it is an obvious budget production and all the actors get to have a good line. I liked that democratic approach to film making and made it all the more inclusive. That is one of the other strengths of the film, in that it strives for inclusivity and acceptance even through jealousy of another persons life style. This then is a great little feel good factor flick with some laughs thrown in, and I did rather enjoy it.",1303948800,,1372,4.0777777777777775

The things that are the most interesting about the movie are pretty much the lead actors themselves - Ryan Carnes and Scott Lunsford. Since these two actors can at least ACT, this makes the movie worth watching. Ryan Carnes is a complete hottie and it was nice to see both his and Lunsford's full-frontal nudity scenes, which is strictly forbidden in most other movies because of the Hollywood restrictions on male nudity.

Just think of it like eating a tasty dessert with no nutritional value. In light of the next two sequels (Sloppy Seconds and All You Can Eat) this first film seems like a experimental trial run. The ideas are sort of interesting, but so bizarre and fanciful that it's played like a cartoon, or vaudeville sketch. The acting is broad but spirited.

2270635,1,B00099415C,"I went into this movie not expecting anything deep or meaningful, how could you with that soft-core DVD cover?  What I was hoping for were some cheap thrills in seeing guys naked and maybe some laughs.  The movie is not well written, acted or filmed.  As I said, I wasn't expecting much so all that I could forgiven.  What I can't forgive is the depiction of the main female character, Gwen.  It seems that everyone (the actress, writers, director) was doing their best to make Gwen into the most unlikable, detestable character in the world.  They might have been going for a character that was ""quirky"" and ""honest"" and ""fun.""  Instead we got a girl that came off as nothing less than rude, tacky, horny and dumb.

Of course the worst part was that every other character was so willing to put up with her crap.  I kept wondering, ""Why does Caleb want this girl?  Dude, you're not the best actor, but you can do better.""  But EVERYONE in this movie seemed to love her.  The biggest offence happened most of the way through the movie, Gwen betrays another character in the most reprehensable way.  And when they find out about it at the end of the movie...it's shrugged off two seconds later as an ""Oh well"" type moment.  I got up and screamed at my TV then.  These guys all needed to get some balls b/c Gwen obviously had them all in her purse.

In the end, I was just confused about what I supposed to be routing for in this movie.  Was I supposed to route for Caleb to give into his possible gay urges and go all the way with Marc?  Was I supposed to want this ruse to work and for Gwen and Caleb to get together?  Or was I supposed to want Kyle (Jim Veraros in the only decently acted role) to find love somehow?  In the end, the only thing I was hoping for was for Gwen to fall into a ditch and die.

This type of dumb movie isn't really worth this much thought.  But I don't think I have ever been angered so much by one character in a movie. Of course, everyone else in the movie kept talking about how awesome she was so they're idiots,too.  The fact that she's in the sequel just makes me want to steer clear.

2270638,3,B00099415C,"It is very obvious, as soon as you start watching this movie, that this is a low-budget kind.  Yet, despite its cheap quality, it's somewhat funny and plain weird.  Just be in the mood to watch something zany before you pop in this DVD.

First of all, this movie carries the message that gay men are often surrounded by women.  Not only that but that gay men and women friends share affection, which can lead to sex.  O.....k!

So, the movie opens with Caleb and his girlfriend Tiffani.  At first, it looks like they must be acting for a porn film.  Actually, they were just role-playing.  Tiffani isn't impressed with Caleb and dumps him.

Dejected, Caleb goes home to his gay roommate, Kyle (Jim Verranos).  (What ever possess Jim to do this film?)  From Kyle, Caleb is led to believe that sex sometimes happens between gay men and their women friends.  So, Caleb decides to declare himself gay so he can land himself a woman.

Next to enter the picture are Gwen and Marc.  Gwen and her gay roommate, Marc, are hosting a party at their apartment.  Gwen has just been dumped by her obviously gay boyfriend after coming out to her.  Kyle likes Marc but feels he's out of the league for Marc to notice him.  Caleb sees Gwen and immediately desires her.

A perfect opportunity opens up for Marc, Gwen, Caleb and Kyle to meet and introduce each other.  Kyle and Caleb agree Caleb will create an opportunity for Marc to notice Kyle.  Kyle, on the other hand, will try to connect Caleb to Gwen.

Immediately, a date is set up for Marc and Caleb.  When the day comes, Caleb heads over to Marc's place.  While Marc is getting ready, Gwen checks him out and discovers he's a gay virgin which just turns Gwen on.

After the date is over, they go back to Marc's place.  Gwen is somewhere else.  Marc wants to jump into bed ith Caleb but without any pressure.  Nothing is happening.  Gwen calls and discovers that the date is platonic.  She speaks to Caleb and initiates phone sex.  Meanwhile, Marc takes advantage and works on him.

Kyle discovers what happens afterwards and is disappointed in Caleb.  Caleb decides to solve this whole mess by inviting Gwen and Marc over for dinner.  Kyle makes it worse by inviting Caleb's parents over.  Everything just goes wrong.

When the night is over, the truth comes out among the four of them.  All I can say is that it's a happy ending for all of them.

*Eating Out* is cheesy funny, weird and oddly kinky.  If you like zany films, then go ahead and watch this low-budget movie.  Just don't expect to be impressed.",1167782400,7,2549,4.504385964912281

2270642,4,B00099415C,"This is a farce, a comedy of the absurd, where roles and plotlines are exaggerated to create a level of comedy well above our usual standards or expectations. To suspend disbelief is to allow oneself to be entertained. So it is that we might believe that in one party on one evening the stars allign and the straight guy posing as a newly out gay guy will win over the fag hag, (who hangs with gay men trying to cure them and experiences heartbreak after heartbreak) while at the same time landing the hotty roommate of the fag hag. Got it? Yikes!

Did I mention the straight guy is playing the role because his roommate who is gay, believes that ultimately he will land the hotty and his roommate will disclose the farce to the woman and all will be perfect?

The plot is definately above and beyond reality. That is half the fun of this comedy. The roommate who devises this plan, played by American Idol contestant Jim Verraros, as Kyle, is neither a jock or twink. Kyle is average and secretly adores Marc, played by Ryan Carnes. Marc is a handsome, sculpted blonde, who studies music at the same university as Kyle. Marc is the type who can have almost anything he wants, as we see in an early scene when he hooks up in a broom closet with another hotty, but calls it quits when his man refuses to kiss.

Caleb is Kyles roommate, the straight guy who plays it gay. Caleb is handsome and typifies the ideal boyfriend from all the John Hughes films of the 80s...he is a jock, has a great body, dark hair, is a little slow, and seems genuinely nice. Caleb is played by Scott Lunsford.

Caleb actually goes so far as to date Marc, and is involved in a menage a trois of sorts with Marc and Gwen. Gwen is played by Emily Hands. This encounter is interesting in that Caleb is left confused by the sexual experiment of sorts and the manner in which it all occurred. Kyle worries that Caleb says little when he comes home. Marc and Gwen each fall for Caleb.

Confused that the plot has backfired, Kyle arranges for a dinner party for the four of them, and adds Calebs Mom, Dad and sister to round out the climax of the farce.

Dinner is interrupted by the gilted ex girlfriend of Caleb, who enters the scene in what is likely the most absurd comedic flaw in the plot. I imagined a drumbeat and stripper whistle from a burlesque show to play whenever she spoke. Having not been invited, and contributing little to the overall story, this character hurts the film and detracts from what silliness should prevail.

The parts of Calebs mom and dad and sister were shallow, dimensionless and flat. It is tough to determine if they are being comedic or just bad actors when they spout their untraditional response to revelations at the dinner table. Any criticism of them is just and appropriate.

By dinners end, Caleb had been ""outed"" by Gwen, and then revealed he is straight to everyone. Gwen offends Kyle with one of the most harsh, meanspirited moments in film, and yet remains attractive to Caleb. Marc, confused and now realizing that the scheme had him involved with a straight guy who would never really be into him, goes to comfort Kyle and reveals in his conversation with Kyle that he always admired Kyle from afar. Kyle asks why Marc always acted like he didn't know Kyle and went as far as to address him with a different name everytime they spoke. Marc says he doesnt know why, but thats all in the past. Handsome Marc wants to build a relationship with average Kyle (at then end of the DVD I bought, there is a few scenes of them together, after the closing credits).

Okay, so this was a farce, right? So our disbelief must remain in tact. Before anything there was Kyle and Caleb two good friends, one gay and one straight. One might watch the film and wonder why Caleb would want Gwen who was as cruel as ever to Kyle. One might also be skeptical of the Kyle/Marc affair, too. But this is a comedy and a farce. It shouldnt all be neat and clean at the end and we don't see the ending as it might have been in a drama or a tragedy.

I think the story was entertaining and better than a heck of a lot more comedies I'd seen over the years. The gay plot was an interesting twist and I think this was a brave effort on everyones part.

Jim V. did a good bit of acting and was convinceing in his role. I came to like Caleb as a character and will look on IMDB.com for his other work. Gwen was average and unremarkable. Marc was handsome and a darn good actor, his physical comedy timing is good, and his expressions and gestures exceptional. You could sense his hesitationa and frustration with Caleb.

And you cannot exclude from the review that Caleb and Marc are nude in a scene, which is tasteful and not gratuitous.

Eating Out is a farce. It is a comedy. It is to be enjoyed for what it is and not for what others mistake it might have been.",1150675200,5,4853,4.3729189789123195

If you get hooked up on reality you wouldn't watch or buy most stuff!  Yes there is some over-acting but have you seen Dante's Cove? Now that is over acting - or more likely NO acting!

I think Eating Out is a light, sweet, love conquers all movie.  It isn't hard core - it is a love story. Well two really - one hetero and one gay.  Eating Out shows that the journey is as interesting as the destination - sometimes more so.

The phone sex scene adds a whole new dimension to the concept - I don't care if it isn't 'reality', I liked it!

My favourite favourite scene was the kissing scene at the end - beautiful gay kiss yummm.  Often done badly - this looked natural.  It's that LOVE story thing for me - can't get enough of a happy ending, and some unrequited love being requited:0)

Then you get the bonus kiss and make out session in the Special Features...again yummm and a nice surprise.

2270644,2,B00099415C,"""Eating Out"" is worthy of two stars only because it isn't completely repulsive and amateurish. That would be one star on Amazon because they don't allow users to enter ""no stars"".

Eating Out is a silly film premise that warrants no more than a comedy sketch in a Mad TV episode: straight boy pretends to be gay in order to bed a hot women who only falls for gay men. That's the premise folks! Nothing more, nothing less.

The guy who plays Shawn Pyfrom's boyfriend on ""Desperate Housewives"" is one of the stars. He's attractive enough and he can act (though he'll win no awards for it). Jim Verraros (one of the American Idol rejects) is in it too and to be kind...he's not horrible.

The women in this film all seem to be from ""Bad Acting 101"" as none of them can deliver a line without it sounding like it's got quotes around it. The ""straight"" boy's parents are absolutely painfully bad actors.

This is apparently some sort of a well regarded film in gay circles. Why? I don't get it.....Is it because two of the actors have some dubious credentials?

Geez, I thought we were moving beyond the whole ""gay guerrilla"" filmmaking level. As I've said in previous reviews, this whole ""homospoitation"" (as in ""blackspoiltation"" films) film aesthetic was old once the first few came out.

Few chuckles aside; I believe this movie had potential, great looking male leads, Jim Verraros was by far the best actor even though was lacking the obligatory ""six-pack"" under his shirt.  What is disturbing about this film is not the script, per say, it is the awful lead female role.  She is shrill at best, and as most reviewers have noted, has no redeeming qualities.  Why would anyone gay or straight want to `hang' with her?

The writing is desperately trying to be hip and might have been successful had the characters lived in the eighties verses the new millennium.  I'm in my forties and understood the Anthony Michael Hall references, but how many twenty something's watch anything from twenty years earlier?

The phone sex scene was hot but degrading for all gay and straight men.  How self hating must Ryan Carnes be to give a man a BJ while on the phone with another?  I was confused and weirded out all at the same time.  Was this cinematic brilliance or a scorn on the prevailing mores of our times?  Not sure.

Aside from that, it is awful.  The characters' behavior throughout the entire movie is utterly unrealistic.  I found myself cringing at how stereotypes were utilized in this movie (particularly one gay character at the beginning of the movie who is portrayed in an excessively flamboyant manner).  The plot is also advanced in a similarly unrealistic manner - Caleb, a straight male character decides to feign homosexuality (even going as far as engaging in some awkward homosexual activity) in order to win Gwen, a heterosexual female.

Gwen's reactions to Caleb are completely nonsensical.  Even though she is under the impression that Caleb is gay, she appears to make serious attempts to seduce him.  She produces a similarly absurd reaction to new information at the end of the movie when the plot finally unravels.

I would be offended if the makers of this movie honestly thought that people actually act the way the characters did in this movie.  Fortunately, this was only a comedy, and only serves to entertain, not make a point.  Unfortunately, I did not find myself smirking very often while I watched it.

I was dying to see it, and when my boyfriend and his friends rented it last night, I was really excited. Unfortunately, the film was a boring, predictable, and horribly written mess. The four of us watched the film in open-mouthed horror, wondering if it was a joke or if the cast and crew actually thought they were making a good film.

The script is ridiculous. From the opening scene, the film does not make any sense. The characters are even worse. One-dimensional cardboard cutouts is too nice a phrase to describe the shallow, conceited, and idiotic characters in the movie. The main female love interest is the most irritating and obnoxious character on film, ever, and I did not buy the lead male character falling for her. She had no characteristics worth falling for. If an audience doens't buy the main romance that composes the plot, then the film is in trouble. What was even more ridiculous is that she would date only flamboyantly gay men, then b***h and moan when they would out themselves. Was her character supposed to be deaf and dumb? I didn't get it.

The dialogue was ridiculously bad. Do people actually talk like that? I didn't think so. The self-referencial dialogue used brilliantly by Kevin Williamson just sounds dumb here. It didn't work.

Luckily, the film wrapped itself up quickly by the 80 minute mark, sparing us the extra ten minutes I thought it would go on. The film didn't end soon enough.

I do not get all the glowing reviews for this film. I don't think I'd even consider it a film. It was a horrible, horrible 80 minute torture-fest, and time I will never get back! Spare yourselves and just watched Broken Hearts Club again.",1134777600,17,1836,4.674922600619195

This script seems to have been written by someone completley out of touch with how young people converse, as the lingo in this film was incredibly ridiculous.  You almost feel embarrassed for the actors, as they must surely have realized how corny the lines were.  Not to mention the entire plot was absurd, and the characters incredibly two dimensional.  As another reviewer noted, the supposedly ""hot"" girl is the most irritating character in the film. At the film's climax, you find yourself waiting to see her get get slapped, but alas, it never happens.

2270662,5,B00099415C,"I saw this at the Loft Theatre in Tucson, AZ, in a special presentation by the producer.  In the first 5 minutes, I said to myself, ""This is the most impossible premise for a movie I've ever seen.  They can't possibly pull this off!""  Well, they really did!  The premise is ridiculous -- a straight kid decides to play gay because a gay friend of his says that a woman he is attracted to only dates gay men.  Heartfelt writing and directing and absolutely real performances from the cast members make this movie totally believable (except for one minor plot twist at the very end).  And the two male leads are gorgeous!  (Although their performances are REALLY what makes the movie work.  Honest!)  This is a keeper.",1133395200,33,716,4.574803149606299
2270663,3,B00099415C,"Can we agree that the ideal is that art imitates life and not life imitates art?  Eating Out is an artistic imitation of a real segment of life.  No matter how much one may despise these ""stereotypes,"" they are indeed fashioned after real people.  Every single character represents someone or something that I have known in my life.  I'm not saying that I think positively of these types, but they do indeed exist as real people.  Thus, Eating Out is successful since it imitates life, the goal of most art.  What more does it need do?  If some of these types have wounded you personally in love or otherwise, how can bashing this movie be any real revenge or satisfaction?

This film is mediocre, but it does live up to its reputation and expectation.  Whoever expected this to be Oscar caliber deserves to be disappointed.  It always appeared as light-hearted comedy with a gay theme, which it is, and it doesn't need to be more than that.

All the actors are cute or handsome.  And, if the acting seemed fake and shallow, then the types the characters are modeled on are fake and shallow too.  The direction is dead on for getting the superficiality correct.  I live in Los Angeles and go to West Hollywood sometimes.  But I've seen this same syndrome in Tampa Florida.  There are so many people in the age of cellular phones as fashion and coffee shops as home-away-from-home who use manufactured facades (and who can blame them) that what was status quo behavior in the 60s, 70s, or even 80s just ain't happening now.  Things change.  The world is such a cold, scary, increasingly high-tech place that it is no wonder that people are increasingly automatic, mechanical, superficial, whatever, . . .  Some of you reviewers should just look in the mirror to figure this one out.  We'll all have to accept the fact that sophistication is the reward and consequence of technology, and its cost is simplicity, honesty, even real love.

One sad observation about life today is that ""gays"" are too sanitized consequential to trying too hard to act straight, or to pass as straight.  And what should be the hallmark of homosexual men-creativity, courage, style-I'm afraid may becoming more true of  heterosexual men, who are not afraid of looking or acting gay.  Thus the term Metrosexual was born.  This concept may not last forever, but the fact that it even started is very significant.  Hmmmm?  Gays who I thought were so cute in that quaint ""queeny"" style are almost non-existent.  I suppose that is not professional, when professionalism is worth selling your soul for.  OK then.  However, anyone actually ashamed of their sexual orientation shouldn't spew their resentment on those who may be proud.  Think about all the closeted, bland, despicable homosexuals you may know, and the adverse affect they have on the gay community at large.  Maybe some homosexuals must pass into corporate America to benefit all, but I'll always love and remember the ""happy and gay"" attitude gays had, in sharp contrast to self-loathing and excessive envy.

Gwen (the blond babe) was cute and reminds me of the type of gay male who lived freely.  I felt Oscar Wilde's votary had written her dialogue.  I just laughed and laughed whenever she was on screen.  I'd love to date her, and would consider any lengths to do so.  Kyle (Jim Verraros) was dead on for the lonely, underrated gay male who is, in fact, a great catch, much like a diamond in the rough.  Caleb (Scott Lunsford) was totally in character as the sensitive stud pretending to be gay to get Gwen.  So many guys in my youth were just like him.  They were both masculine and sensitive at the same time.  In a stretch, you can imagine Bill Clinton as Caleb (he, he, he).  Marc (Ryan Carnes), Gwen's roommate, didn't faze me one way or the other, although I understand what most reviewers see in him.

Stay away from this film if you expect more than a light-hearted comedy that banks on frontal nudity and vulgarity.  Try Johns, Orlando, Six-Degrees of Separation, or Gods and Monsters if you want gay-themed masterpieces.

This movie gets three stars (not 4 or 5) from me simply for reminding us that being gay is supposed to be ""different"" from being straight and a whole lot more fun.",1132790400,3,4235,4.717598908594816
2270664,1,B00099415C,"This has got to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I had such high hopes for this film, what with it being on the cover of the Advocate and such. Alas, the hype surrounding it was the only thing working for it. There is absolutely nothing to recommend about it. The writing, directing, and especially the acting, are of the worst sort, the kind made possible with a budget of about $100. The plot, and I use the term loosely, is threadbare and cliched, and not in the least bit believable. For example: what person, gay or straight, would want to spend more than five seconds in the company of the lead female chararcter, who is supposedly to die for? She was the loudest, most obnoxious person in the entire movie (not to mention homophobic, despite having a gay best friend!), and we're supposed to believe the the lead straight man would pretend to be gay to get close to her? Come on! I was waiting for someone to bitch her out or at the very least tell her to shut up, but alas, no. And don't get me started on the ludicrous phone sex scene. It was completely insulting. The only positive thing I can say about this ""film"" is that it's relatively short. The much ballyhooed full frontal male nudity is not enough to shell out the money to rent it, let alone buy it. Save your money!",1132444800,13,1302,4.318367346938776
2270665,5,B00099415C,"The fact that there is no eating out in this movie (I checked twice for restaurants!) is just part of its brilliance. Q Allan Brocks's opus to modern life in Tuscon, AZ had me questioning why all movies aren't made as masterfully as this one. The film never compromises or goes for the obvious answer. When one of the main characters pretends to be gay so that the girl of his dreams would find him irresistible, I had no idea that things would turn so Shakespearian. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that a crazy comedy of errors would ensue! It also surprised me how little it disapponted me that the trailer that played before the movie gave away every important plot point. I actually breathed a sigh of relief, because it meant I didn't have to pay close attention to the movie because I all ready knew what was going to happen.

I think I was most surprised by how effeminate most of the homosexual characters in the film acted. Previously, I had assumed that most gay men were not very different from straight men. ""Eating Out"" revealed the depths of the gay culture that I never knew existed, with their own clothes and music and clever catchphrases. Now I know that gay men have to sleep with each other on the first date thanks to the writer of this film (who must obviously also be gay!) In short, ""Eating Out"" is not only a surprisingly entertaining mystery (you'll never guess who the killer is), but also a fairly educational study of modern gay men. I certainly learned a lot about my misconceptions from this film and I know you will too, so stay in and order ""Eating Out"" today.",1131840000,6,1601,4.464163822525597
2270666,3,B00099415C,"Eating Out is a gay-themed romantic comedy, so the situation is about a man loving another man. But actually, it tells more than that.

Caleb (Scott Lunsford) is a straight man whose lives with his gay friend, Kyle (Jim Verraros)in a pure friend relation. Marc (Ryan Carnes) is a hunky gay lives with his best friend Gwen (Emily Brooke Hands). Caleb have a major crush with Gwen, but since Gwen only fond with gay guy, so Kyle set Caleb as a newly gay and it emerges a sudden attraction for both Gwen and Marc. So it begin a game with hearts and sexual orientation.

On paper, Eating Out looks a delight fun, well it is actually, but this movie really like a shoddy entertainment than a solid one. The plot's line and all the characters are so unbelievable that's so hard to be plausible. For example, it could be easy to Caleb to act straight but he never does. Some characters also suffers form lack of decent personality. Gwen for instance. I can't believe that Caleb could fall for her, while in the real life that is almost impossible to love with a sassy girl like Gwen. She is so horrid and scream a lot that annoying much. Gwen is one of the horrid female characters that appears in this little movie, while all the male actors are eye candy. All the actors are lesser but Ryan Carnes, whose also appears in the TV series hit, 'Desperate Housewives'.

Despite the plot and characters that are made in therapy, Eating Out is rather a fine entertainer because we could laugh occasionally. It has a happy ending and happy tone that guarantee that everybody's happy.",1131408000,,1570,4.540636042402827

Totally uninformative, and only enlightening if you want details on how the female lead of the film really sounds in bed.  Actually, the female lead is the main problem with the film on-screen as well, though that's probably the fault of the screenplay.  The hero of the film, a straight man desperate to have a new girlfriend, seems totally besotted with her for no discernible reason, except she's there.  If he'd just wanted sex, there are easier ways to go about getting it.  He's attractive, and so are the other two men in the film, straight guy's roommate, long time longing for him, and the straight girl's gay roommate.  Both gay guys are busy lusting after the straight boy.  And though the gay roommate is supposed to be a 5 out of 10, actually the actor is too attractive for the loser character he's supposed to be.  The ""darting"" relationship between the two gay roommates as they run into each other is actually the most fun and enlightening relationship in the film, in a romance novel kind of way.  Otherwise, there's a very peculiar phone sex scene that leaves all the characters troubled over it afterwards, and finally some totally gratuitous male FF nudity that is welcome without being lascivious.  So the film is a mixed bag, positive on the male front, totally mystifying when it comes to the females.  Quite deadpan funny parents for straight guy, as well.",1131062400,2,1477,4.73046875

Here's the gist: Caleb wants Gwen, while Caleb's roommate Kyle wants Gwen's best friend Marc, but of course Marc wants Caleb. Kyle convinces Caleb to pretend to be gay in order to win Gwen through Marc. Sexy, hysterical mayhem ensues. This clever film plays with the perennial themes of love and sex, adding a playful twist on sexual orientation to create a ""comedy of manners"" for the 21st century. Instead of 18th century disguises, sexual orientation is the mask, and there are cellphones instead of screens, but the comedy is just as classic. And what truly makes it work, as with any good comedy of manners, is the keen insight into our human nature. Writer/director Q. Allan Brocka clearly knows all about wanting what we can't have, pretending not to want what we really most want, and other such games we play, and he's written it incisively into his script with dead-on truth that would be heart-piercing if it weren't so funny at the same time. His ear for language, his queer eye (equally adept at sexy bodies and kitschy architecture), and his sense of timing and pace all make this film really work. He playfully slips in thoughtful juxtapositions that explore acting, pretending, faking and reality, while keeping us laughing for the whole ride. The cast were all superb, including the adorably guileless straight boy Caleb (Scott Lunsford), lusty faghag Gwen (Emily Stiles), and star-crossed gay boys Marc (Ryan Carnes, newly resident gay boy on Wisteria Lane) and Kyle (Jim Verraros, a finalist from the first American Idol).

Now that I have seen Eating Out, my appetite has been somewhat satisfied.

Granted, the acting in this film was not all that great, yet there was a certain charm in each persons role. Even the slutty and royaly snobbish Tiffani had some sort of charm buried somewhere in that dildo loving facade she had. Of course, her rape fetish was a little much for me to consume and it seemed the same for those who heard of it or... ahem, expierienced it first hand.

But, this movie is not about her. It is mostly about Kaleb (straight) and Kyle (gay), roommates who concoct the perfect plan to get the objects of their desires. Straight guy goes gay and in a heated moment really goes gay... but then discovers that he was only pushed in that direction because of the mystery his real object of LUST provided for him. As for the gay roommate... well, let's just say that in the end, everyone seems perfectly mismatched for everyone. While there were some really good one liners and some hysterical stereotyping, there was also some rather over the top moments that were strangely unbelievable. The comming out party with the family was just too much of a feel good moment for me... the phone sex scene was a little off base and should have been the ultimate clue to ""straight"" roommates desires. I am happy I saw the movie. I am happy I bought it. But a warning... if you are getting it strictly for the eye candy, you may want to skip it then... there is not much.

A. The cotton candy colored production design and light frothy attuitude that seems better suited for an audience of pre high school girls. Why do all ""gay films"" look like cheap outdated 1980's highschool comedies?

B. Yet another ""gay film"" centered around a loud, borish, unpleasant fag hag character. Does anyone really know someone like this? Would anyone want to spend more than three minutes around her? It was beyond tedious to sit through another film and watch gay men fawn and bow and scrape to yet another shrill creepy bitch with absolutely no redeeming values. I have a number of female friends, and I can tell you, none of them resemble this nasty creature at all.

C. The cute straight guy who, for some cliched resaon, must debase himself by pretending to be gay. Watching his archly horrified reaction as another man attempted to connect with him  on a valid personal level was sickening.

D. The nerdy gay guy getting the hunky circuit boy at the end. Now that's always believable. And tacking it on in the final moments does nothing to erase the preceeding 90 minutes of self-loathing.

E. This piece of garbage merited an Advocate cover story? And the story spent a great deal of time ""oohhing and ahhhing"" over the oh so handsome straight actors that were very very brave to take on these roles. The scrawny, unappealing actor is, of course, openly gay.

In the film's climatic (in more ways than one :) scene, Marc and Caleb come home to an empty apartment, and Gwen tries to calm down (and turn on) a supposedly virginal Caleb over the phone, so he and Marc can get it on.  When Kyle finds out that he and Marc (kinda sorta) has sex, Kyle decides to set up some confrontations by inviting Gwen and Marc ... and Caleb's parents and kid sister ... to dinner at their apartment, to force Caleb to reveal he is not gay, hopefully to give Kyle a chance to get Marc on the rebound.  Funny scene to top off a very entertaining, sexy, light comedy, the kind of ""date film"" we rarely see in gay cinema, and enjoyable by both gay and openminded straight audiences.

Winner of awards at quite a few gay film festivals over the past year or so, ""Eating Out"" was filmed mostly in Tucson AZ.  The direction and photography looks considerably better than its indie budget would normally command, and I also thought the acting was exceptional for the genre, from the actors named to include the supporting players (the parents and kid sister, Tiffani the slut, etc.) Unrated, but would be a solid R for frontal male nudity (Lunsford and Carnes) and similated sex.",1123200000,2,1939,4.6
2270687,4,B00099415C,"Eating Out is a sex farce, in the grand tradition of same. Think American Pie, Porkies or any John Hughes film. That was the intention of the filmmakers.

One review has mentioned that there are two different versions of the film available. Not quite true. There are two different covers on the DVD, one of which is a lot less ""gay."" The content of the film is identical however. The original cover was deemed too racy by some retailers, so a new one was designed for those outlets. So don't worry about hunting around for one cover or the other - the DVD content itself has not been editied for the ""tamer"" cover.",1123200000,2,614,4.433628318584071
2270688,1,B00099415C,"Absolutely awful.  One of the worst movies I've seen this year.  Feeds into every negative stereotype I can think of about gay young men.  It isn't all that flattering to women either.  In fact it is very insulting.

Some will say this a fluff movie that should be enjoyed for what it is.  I like fluff.  Movies like Trick, I Think I Do, and All Over the Guy are romantic comedies that entertain without being too serious.  The problem with Eating Out is the terrible writing and predictable plot.

The performances aren't all that inspiring either.  To be fair Ryan Carnes is very handsome (he really does remind me of a young Brad Pitt) and delivers a decent performance.  But the other actors reek.  In particular, the Gwen character played by Emily Brooke Hands is so completely over the top that watching her creates a desire to turn on the oven to 350 and break out the honey glaze.",1123113600,4,888,4.515723270440252
2270689,4,B00099415C,"Yes, I know there's over-acting and under-acting here, and the camera work could have been more professional, and nobody who's a musician in this film seems at all musical.  However, I thought it was an adorable little farce with some great lines and like all farces, some profundities underneath the surface.  This film explores the mysteries of desire in a unique way--I don't want to reveal it, but there's a take on phone sex unlike anything I've ever seen.  The director scores bigtime for that.  As for people saying the acting is ""pedantic""--I assume pedestrian was the word sought for?  And someone being stuck in 1982?  Hel-lo, plenty of people have their own weird nostalgia trips.  Nothing unbelievable there.",1123027200,,720,5.0
2270690,2,B00099415C,"i have bought a few gay-themed movies lately, and must say i liked most of them very well (Tales,The Trip,Longtime Companions,The Band played on,Gods and Monsters,etc....)

This one, however, was a total dissappointment, unfortunately.

with the exception of the 3 male leads, the acting was very poor, over the top and very unbelievable. the female love-interest is annoying throughout the entire film, someone you just want to slap -and hard!

and when she finally becomes the nasty bitch you suspect she really is, at the end, she still gets the guy -i found it hard to believe someone would be stupid enought to still fall for her, the way she she disrespectfully treats everyone around her.

though i had hopes the movie would eventually pick up and turn into a decent story, i never felt particularly amused and had no laughs.the sex-scene was hard to swallow (no pun intended)and though you get to see the two sexy leads dicks, it didn't make up for anything.also, whether straight or gay, it would be nice to see some people kissing and actually be able to buy the passion they are supposed to sell on the screen.the ""gay-love-confession"" at the end was very lame.

""the opposite of sex"", for example, dealt with a similar theme, but was very believable, and sporting a terrific cast of talented actors.

unfortunately, in my opinion,this movie didn't.",1122854400,3,1360,4.891304347826087
2270691,2,B00099415C,"First off, let's just say it: Ryan Carnes is hot. One of the few who won the genetic lottery, he knows what it took to get him where he is today and makes no apologies for it. It was that confidence, I'm sure (along with his great body), was the reason Marc Cherry cast him on Desperate Housewives (as another gay guy). However, that being said, he turns in the best performance in this film. Eating Out is not bad, that is if you want amateurish acting and bad production design that come with filming an indie feature. Otherwise, the film scores little for me beyond Carnes. The convoluted story takes too long to get going and Jim Verraros' Kyle talks like he's living in 1982. I found the acting to be pedantic and remain unsure at the final dinner where Caleb's parents find out that their son Caleb is ""gay"", if the acting was meant to be horrible or a commentary on gay-themed  films that make the parents so understanding (and find it still disingenuous that his parents remain in the dark) of their gay children. Still, Carnes shines in his role as Marc (what is with guys who spell their names Marc are always gay?) and is very believable. As a smart actor, he takes on the role and dives in with everything, no matter if he has to kiss another guy. That's why he became an actor (or let us hope so). But as Marc, Carnes shows us that he may be a pretty boy, but he has an odd family that he loves dearly, he's not narcissistic and actually lives in a furnished apartment. But, as the film ended in the most unrealistic way, the openly gay Verraros fulfilled every queer man's dream: He got to kiss the hunky-with-the-hot-body straight actor. Of that, I'm completely jealous",1122854400,2,1684,4.432258064516129
2270692,3,B00099415C,"""Eating Out"" is a fun comedy showing how romantic misrepresentations lead to impossible situations.  In olden days Plautus and Shakespeare would have one character pretend to be of the other sex.  Newly liberated, we are able to portray what happens when one character decides as a romantic stratagem to pose as someone of a different sexual orientation.

Caleb Peterson (played by Scott Lunsford) has just been dumped by rape-fantasist Tiffani (played by Rebekah Kochan).  Caleb's gay roommate Kyle (played by Jim Verraros), while commiserating with him, mentions that women find attempting sex with gays to be exciting.  When Caleb whines that in that case he'd like to be gay, Kyle gets an idea.

At a party Caleb mentions he has his eye on Gwen Anderson (played by Emily Stine), with a penchant for flirting (and more) with gay men.  Kyle introduces Caleb as gay to Gwen.  Gwen's roommate, Marc Everhard, a gay, classical-music student (played by Ryan Carnes), shows up and is immediately interested in the pretend-gay Caleb.  Kyle, wanting Marc for himself, is not fully comfortable with the situation.  Marc takes Caleb out to a music party, to a video rental store, and then to Marc's home.  Let the fun begin.  Caleb's family, Tiffani, and some cute hunks add to the stresses and temptations.  There are happy, romantic endings for the principals.  [It is absolutely mandatory to wait out the end credits to get a satisfying resolution to one sub-plot.]

The premise is refreshing, the acting is all right, and the direction was fine.  The sets, locations, and camera work  are adequate but spare.  The film was set in Tucson, Arizona, a welcome new look.

There were substantial skin shots.  Caleb and Marc give their all.  Kyle and two characters, Sebastian, a British fellow (played by Christopher Michaels), and Joey, who comes out to Gwen (and is played by William Shepard) provide additional shots.  All are attractive.

The film is a comedy; so one has to be a little accepting of the forced happy endings with Caleb's family and with the resolution of Marc's situation.  There would have been more unity if Sebastian and Joey could have had a bit more time in sub-plots.  Having less time with Gwen in seductive mode might have helped.  It would have been nice to get more of a feel for urban Tucson and to have had more camera motion.  A higher budget cures many things.

As extras, there is an attractive photo gallery, and on opening the DVD there is a useful preview of the film.  Oddly, the film has only four DVD scenes to select from, one of which is about forty minutes long for the 85 minute movie.  There is an average commentary track with remarks by director Brooks, actors Verraros, Stiles, and Kochan, and by two producers.  The acoustic is reverberant and poses difficulties when more than one is speaking at a time.

The movie is fun and a stretch.  Isn't that what comedies are for?",1122595200,4,2915,4.800804828973843
2270693,4,B00099415C,"This little film plays more like a French farce than a Hollywood film and if watched with that in mind it is sure to entertain.  So many writers have mined this vein of boy playing girl playing boy in the web of catching the designated lover that it must be one of the more durable lines for comedy success through the years.  Adding the contemporary slant of gay proposing straight posing as gay so that straight can get girl and gay can get lover works...but you have to stay with this one to catch all the double entendres that make it fun.

Classical music student Marc (a new 'Brad Pitt' like Ryan Carnes!) is a popular gay hunk who lives with Gwen (Emily Brooke Hands) who thinks she is the one responsible for making straight boys turn gay (!), so convinced is she that all the good men are gaily unavailable to her.  Caleb (Scott Lunsford) is a straight guy who lives with jazz music student gay Kyle (Jim Verraros) in a purely roommate situation.  Caleb, after an hilarious opening physical setup encounter with Tiffani (Rebekah Kochan), is convinced that gay men have an easier time of getting partnered than straight men.  At a party Caleb meets Gwen who thinks Caleb is with Kyle, Caleb wants Gwen, and Kyle wants the apparently aloof Marc.  Kyle convinces Caleb that if Caleb poses as gay he will gain entry into the Gwen/Marc abode and have access to Gwen while Kyle will have access to Marc. A spur of the moment telephone sex call (Gwen is attempting to turn on Caleb in front of Marc) results in Caleb and Marc 'hitting it off' much to the confusion of everyone.  Add a dinner party for the four people involved which Caleb's ever-so-accepting family also attends and the whole situation explodes.  How this whole schema plays out is the punch line of the film and all's well that end's well!

The cast is young and inexperienced and in need of a heavier directorial hand, but they are unanimously loveable and the men are certainly eye candy.  As written and directed by Q. Allan Brocka EATNG OUT sails along breezily and provides enough fun for all audiences.  Grady Harp, July 05",1122508800,94,2099,4.568
2270694,1,B00099415C,"Do yourself a favor... go rent Latter Days.

This film is only going to be remembered for the bizarre phone sex/real time sex scene.  That's it.

Kyle is a self-loathing bottom feeder with so many issues he has volumes.  He has the hots for Mark, the gay roomate of the girl the straight boy Caleb has the hots for.  So, to create an absolute mess of everyone's lives, Kyle comes up with the brilliant idea to make Caleb gay to get close to the girl.  It works, as Caleb ends up with Mark, who can't figure out that Caleb is about as straight as they come.  It all blows up when Kyle, in an act of utter and complete pettiness, has Caleb's family over for dinner to out him.

Once that blows up, the girl tells Kyle what a bottom feeder he is and that he'll never be good enough for the perfect Mark, while Caleb gets smacked for the little charade... then he gets kissed by the girl while Mark admits to Kyle that he's a big jerk and treats Kyle like dirt to get his attention.

Dysfunctional is being kind.  Kyle is utterly self-loathing, Mark is a complete himbo who abuses just about everyone around him, Caleb is the utterly clueless straight guy willing to go for it with a guy just to get the girl, and the girl is so messed up she talks Caleb through his first same sex encounter and then sleeps with him afterwards, and thinks this whole charade is ""the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me"".

Words do not begin to describe how utterly horrid this film is.  It is tasteless, poorly produced, cheap looking, and the acting.. lets just say that Jim Verraros' acting was worse than his AI performances, Ryan Carnes only standing out moment is a flash of nudity, Scott Lunsford's ""rebel without a clue"" look only gets him so far when he can't act his way out of a paper bag, and I can't even remember the name of the actress let alone her messed-up character.

I am so glad I have a movie pass and didn't even pay to rent this trash.  I've been waiting many months for this film, and it was not worth the wait.  For good gay films, check out Latter Days, the Wedding Banquet, or even 24 Days.  Leave this one on the shelf.",1122336000,7,2134,4.2711442786069655

It was not intended to bring out deep seated emotions.  It was not intended to change the viewing public.  But, it was obviously intended to make us laugh.  And, along the way it also got us to see how shallow we sometimes really are.  And, along the way it also got us to see how sometimes gay men and straight men are not too far apart.

8058338,1,B00099415C,"I just stopped this movie for the second time, not five minutes in. The first time I started watching it, I wasn't physically in the room but I certainly heard the sounds of nonconsensual man-on-woman sex. Horrified, I darted into the room and stopped the movie as rapidly as possible, then desperately sought a palate cleanser.

I was about to write my review, then noticed the 160 reviews & 3.5 star rating. Puzzled, I read all of them and found two that were relevant - one mentioned that the opening scene started off like (hetero) porn, then its later revealed to be role-playing. The other reviewer was more explicit - evidently the girlfriend has a sexual assault (my phrase, not theirs) fantasy. Dandy.

So I gave it another go from the top. Yep, it reads like mid-80s straight porn at the very beginning. I suppose the viewer should be tipped off that the scene is indeed a scene when the girlfriend reaches into her bag for a weapon to defend herself and whips out a sizeable adult novelty item. However, the subsequent moments didn't look or sound funny to me, and I didn't care to stick around.

I avoid many Hollywood blockbusters and popular TV shows because of implied or overt sexual assault. The genders and the ages of the involved parties are unimportant to me; I have no desire to see it at all on my screen. I definitely don't want to see it played for yucks, and I foolishly assumed that a movie in a gay rom-com series would be safe territory.
