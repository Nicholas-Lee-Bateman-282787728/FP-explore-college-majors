It brought back such fond memories from when I was a child and this was released, and I was so thrilled to see it was available on DVD.  I remember my Dad making a mark on the calendar of the date the movie was going to be on TV, and were were all fed and bathed and in our footie PJs waiting for the magic to begin. And it never failed.

Fast forward decades later~ my sweet father is no longer with me, and we live in a world with amazing technology. So how could anyone be blown away by this simple production?  Very easily, for me, for it brought me back to a time when life was simple, , when there was beauty in the smallest things, and a mere kiss from your Daddy could make everything better.

I love this movie.  And I miss you so much, Dad!",1516406400,3,800,4.0

Leslie Ann Warren does not have the voice of Julie Andrews, but she had the perfect combination of doe eyes with an innocent face.  I was 11 in 65 and hearing the songs again, I was once again carried back to my childhood.  It was refreshing to see a production this innocent.  I am sure it would be a horrible flop today without deep bass and electric sounds with twerking dancers and cussing, but I love this movie.

Not this one, I first watched this at the tender age of eight, on a small black and white tv brocasting from CBS. And I can't  even explain how I felt after all these years over forty.  I loved it then and I am in love with it now. I remember while  in grade school the next morning well that would take to long. I was singing one of the songs In my own little corner. I was laugh at hated all day long. You see African Americans wasn't  suppose to act that way. But now when I sing it my grown kids love it and my girl watches it with me.

I was so happy when I finally spotted it on Amazon.  For $10, it seemed t be a good deal.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the production quality of the video.  The audio seems fine but the video is poor.  It's out of focus on the left and right sides, sometimes about 25% into the frame.  There was one particular section where everything but the center was out of focus.  This seems to be a very poor and amateur conversion from tape to digital.

2362423,5,B000A5SR46,"This is part of my childhood. This is my favorite childhood fairy tale ever. CBS first aired this in 1965 and every year until 1975. I love everything about this story. I bought this DVD about 10 years ago but it wasn't the an anniversary edition. I had planned to buy the 50th anniversary edition before but I was too busy buying other things. Anyway, It looks better than the DVD  I bought almost 10 years ago. However, This was filmed back in the mid 1960's so it's not going to look like a blu-ray DVD shot in 2016. Leslie Ann Warren was perfect as poor Cinderella and Stuart Damon was perfect as Prince Charming. Jo Van Fleet was perfect as the Stepmother from hell. Unfortunately only I believe Leslie, Stuart and Pat Carroll are still alive. Yes, I Googled to find out who was still with us. Of course they don't look like they did almost 52 years later. Leslie Ann Warren still looks really good, but Stuart Damon is a lot heavier and older, but boy can he sing. Also, there are commentaries with Leslie Ann, Stuart and Celeste Holmes. I can't recommend this DVD enough.",1491696000,5,1078,4.444444444444445

Academy Award nominee Lesley Ann Warren is charming as the raggedy waif turned belle of the ball with Broadway star Stuart Damon as the Prince.

2362549,5,B000A5SR46,"There are quite a few Cinderella movies and I think I have seen all of them. None of them compare to R&H Cinderella. It's the one I grew up watching as a little girl.  I started looking for a copy of this one movie.  I even ordered a copy through Amazon, several years ago, which I immediately returned because it was very poor quality to the point you couldn't even see the faces and the sound was terrible.  When I saw this one advertised as  the ""50th Anniversary"" of R&H Cinderella, I decided to order it again.  As soon as I received it, I put it in the DVD player and watched it from beginning to end ""two"" times.  If you should order this movie, you need to remember it only came out on TV and there were commercials.  On the DVD, where there would of been commercials, the screen  shows ""Overture"" and then it goes back to the movie.  Also, there wasn't HD back then.

2362552,5,B000A5SR46,"Absolutely wonderful - just like I remembered it from my childhood.  I was 5 when this was produced and looked forward to watching it every year. The restored quality is very good and it viewed on my HD TV in full screen and very clear.  I have to wonder if the negative reviews on here are from younger people.  If you aren't 50 or older, you probably won't appreciate this version.  This was a made for TV production in 1965 by CBS.  The video extra interviews with Leslie Ann Warren and Stuart Damon talk about how this was aired by CBS for 10 years after it's original debut in 1965.  I had to laugh at the critical reviewers who complained about the sets/scenery - this was intentional as its the Broadway stage version made for TV - not a Disney movie folks.  Also not sure why some reviews said it was fuzzy or grainy.  I had none of those issues and in fact thought the restoration made it so clear I could see what appear to be acne scars on the face of the actress who plays the step-sister Esmerelda.  I would call that a very clear picture and maybe attribute it to having HD TV as well.  In any case, its a fabulous production and you just want to sing along with all those remarkable Rogers & Hammerstein songs.",1484006400,,1225,4.28695652173913

2362749,5,B000A5SR46,"This was sooo much fun seeing this movie again-like watching a memory! My sisters and I watched it as a young girl in the mid sixties and when it was re-run annually after that. The music is well-written and memorable. Stuart Damon, the prince, just as handsome as ever.

Every year, for the last 6 years, I have given a Princess Party for my family. I purchased this DVD to show after our Royal Banquet. There are 3 generations of ladies/girls that attend our parties and all the ladies and girls loved this movie. The girls, who are used to animation and special effects of today's movies, really loved it. This is such a sweet, romatic movie and like Stuart Damon says in the Retrospective Featurette, this kind of storytelling never goes out of style! I don't understand the reviews saying that it looks or sounds bad, because it looked and sounded fine to me. It does have the look of a filmed theatrical production, as other reviewers have said, and very basic special affects with the appearing of the fairy godmother.  Rogers and Hammerstein music is always so lovely-everyone who watched this movie was heard humming and singing it for several days afterwards!

Sharing this movie with my family and seeing the looks on their faces as they were watching it and then hearing them hum/sing the songs later--priceless! I thoroughly enjoyed it, too, and would recommend it for all princesses/dreamers of all ages.",1471132800,,1418,4.779591836734694

I have looking for a dvd copy to replace the VHS tape I have had for so many years that it is no longer enjoyable to watch due to the worn out condition it is in.  Now I have a bunch of granddaughters that I am introducing it to and they love it! They are learning the songs and dancing around like ballerinas!,1461110400,,405,4.1265822784810124

2362869,5,B000A5SR46,I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loves this original Cinderella. When he opened it up he was so ecstatic. We watched it together and it brought back memories to the first time I saw this rendition. Of course now my husband will probably put it away so nothing will happen to it. He's so funny! But if you love Cinderella and musicals you need to buy this. It's great to be able to watch it again.,1459814400,,417,4.225
2362870,5,B000A5SR46,I watched this version of Cinderella as a child on tv in the 1960s. As soon as I put it in the DVDs player all the songs came right back to me like it was yesterday.,1459468800,,165,3.611111111111111

So when I found it here on DVD I was so thrilled! I have seen just about every version of Cinderella that has been made from animated to non animated and this is by far one of my favorites of the non animated versions I have seen. All of the actors do an amazing job! And who knew Lesley Ann Warren could sing so beautifully? My sister just had a little girl in December and I very much look forward to introducing her to this movie when she is older. I loved fairy tales as a child, this one especially, and I think my niece will too. I think movies like this also teach us great life lessons and this movie is no exception.",1459382400,5,757,3.986842105263158

2362883,5,B000A5SR46,"Having once owned the Sony DVD edition of this title, I can tell you that both video and audio quality have been greatly improved on Shout Factory's 50th anniversary edition DVD. Colors pop out more, detail is greater, the audio doesn't suffer from some terrible faux-stereo enhancement. Everything truly looks and sounds like a 1965 videotaped production should.

The Sony DVD suffered not only from bad simulated stereo, but basically looked like someone transferred a VHS master from the 80's, which would not only be at least one generation removed from the source but was also done with the inferior technology of the time, onto DVD. This new edition from Shout Factory claims to go back directly to the original source material and it shows.  Yes, there is often softness at the edge of the frame, that is likely inherent in the source and can't be fixed, and not a product of the digital restoration. And it seems the audio has been kept in its original mono, which is always best when there aren't any satisfactory elements for a stereo recreation. While the cast album was recorded in stereo, this special was not. The overture, optional in this edition, is lifted from the cast album and therefore is likely in stereo, but Shout Factory did the right thing in keeping the special in mono. They've even restored the title cards that appear on screen after each commercial break, and in viewing the end credits, I even noticed a few more seconds of music at the beginning than before.

Of the bonus material on the Sony DVD, only the retrospective featurette had any real substance, and it's the only one retained in this edition.

The beautiful artwork from the Sony DVD is replicated here, with the addition of a 50th Anniversary Edition banner. The DVD case is clear and artwork is printed on the reverse side, containing a chapter listing and DVD production credits.

If you own the Sony DVD, definitely upgrade to Shout Factory's much-improved release. Given the typical price tag of $10, the upgrade is a no-brainer.",1459209600,,2030,4.82183908045977
2362884,3,B000A5SR46,"This rendition of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella is horrifically portrayed. The original version, with Julie Andrews, was far more successful, without compromising the quality, whereas this film resembled a puppet stage...and would have actually been improved with the use of puppets. It also seemed as if the makers couldn't decide on whether or not the step family was supposed to be actually evil, or just selfish and thoughtless. The original film portrayed the family as thoughtless and selfish. Later films portray the family as evil. This film bounces back and forth between the two, making it all just completely unbelievable.",1459123200,,640,5.41

2363428,4,B000A5SR46,"This is a classic musical. There is a lot of singing. It's OK to watch every 6mo or so... any more than that, it would start to drive you crazy.

Also if you haven't seen this before, this is put on as a stage play, so there are clearly artificial backgrounds, etc. The restoration quality of audio and video is OK. There are a couple places where the audio is a little bit clipped (when the singing is louder, etc.).

However, I like it for nostalgia. It was definitely produced in a simpler time, and provides an alternative to the more modern movies that are way more heavily produced.",1438473600,,588,4.385321100917431
2363439,5,B000A5SR46,"My wife loves the movie, hence the 5 star rating.  Its a classic and if you are a fan, this is a definite must have.

NOTE: Our DVD arrived poorly packaged.  It came in a manila envelopment with a single hard cardboard insert on ONE side.  Sadly our DVD case was damaged, but the DVD itself was not.  So we didn't feel the need to return because we could swap out DVD cases.  I didn't mark down from 5 stars because there is a separate place to leave feedback on the shipping/packaging.

To this day, I still can't believe I married a bride with blue eyes (LOL!!!) after growing up with this vision of feminine perfection singing, dancing and serving her way into her Prince Charming's (and my...) heart.

2363543,5,B000A5SR46,"This ""Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella"" is my favorite version of this classic story. I viewed it several times on TV since it first aired in 1965.  I won't go into how great it is, as others have covered that well.

What I will focus on is the amazing picture quality of this 50th Anniversary DVD, and its improved sound, both vs. the 13-years-older previous DVD release.  That older one had truly excellent video quality on my old, but excellent, standard-definition 32"" tube TV.  When viewing it on my 55"" High-Definition TV, that older DVD version is quite soft as to focus.  Disappointing, but totally expected.  A 1965 TV special shot in video IS NOT SUPPOSED to look excellent on a 2013 hi-def TV.  It was not created for high definition, a technology that was decades away.  It WAS sharp as heck in 1965 on the tube TVs of the day, however.

Well, I purchased the new 50th Anniversary version, which is approximately 13 years newer than the prior DVD version, after reading two fairly technical reviews on another website about why this newer edition looked and sounded better due to its remastering.  That piqued my interest in seeing the newer version, though I had always been happy with the old one (though never had watched the old one on my new High-Definition TV set).

Right after viewing my older DVD version, I viewed the new 50th Anniversary edition (remastered and issued by Shout! Factory, who had butchered some releases I had liked, notably Season 7 of the TV show, ""All In The Family""-- just ruining that), but I was overwhelmed by the improvement on BOTH TV's!  On the SD (older) TV, this newer ""Cinderella"" DVD is sharper (I hadn't thought that would even be possible on the older set), and the colors were more vivid; it just looked distinctly NEWER and better.  And on my new HD TV, it is phenomenally better than the older DVD, and is pretty darned sharp still, CLOSE TO a hi-def look, despite being video (not film) and from 1965, also not being a blu-ray.  It is EXCELLENT, even on a hi-def TV.  The sound, which had seemed fine on the older DVD, is also louder and clearer on both TVs.  (By the way, it basically never makes sense to issue blu-rays for broadcasts shot in video, as this was, as older video, despite its sharpness on old TVs, simply doesn't pack the pixels per square inch to upgrade onto blu-ray.  This is why you basically NEVER see a video broadcast from years ago (such as a soap opera, any live US sports broadcast, or ""All In The Family"" episodes, to cite some examples of video) upgraded from DVD to blu-ray-- the source stock is just not strong enough.)

A wonderful and highly unusual feature of this newer DVD version is that the short featurette on the making of this TV special, shot in 2001, is ALSO upgraded in picture/sound quality for the newer, 50th Anniversary DVD-- this is VERY rare!  Not even done on blu-rays!  Though, as often happens with Shout! Factory releases, the closing credits, as they run, are vibrating and distorted.  Yikes.  The featurette is VERY interesting, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, and Celeste Holm onscreen and speaking repeatedly in it (in 2001 interviews done for this featurette).

They actually reduced the special features on the newer release, notably a selected filmography of the principal actors on the older DVD was excluded from the newer one. Also, some movie trailers were excluded this time.  Lastly, the newer DVD has only a few words representing each chapter on the menu for jumping to a scene, whereas the older DVD has scene names PLUS a thumbnail picture from each scene.

The newer DVD also offers you the choice of the longer overture opening, or not.

I highly recommend upgrading to this new 50th Anniversary edition!  For me, it was only $9.95.  No need to keep the old one for any reason.",1434499200,5,3817,4.673652694610778

2363745,5,B000A5SR46,"Okay, first, let me make one thing clear that some reviewers don't seem to understand: This is a made-for-TV movie filmed in 1965. It won't be in widescreen, it won't be in full screen. It'll be the standard square size of a TV in 1965. It won't have high-definition graphics. It won't have supreme special effects. It was recorded on FILM. Does anyone remember what ""film"" is? I was born in 1988 and we have a ton of VHS and cassette tapes at home... Do you know how physical film has evolved between 1965 and roughly the early 2000s when everything transferred to digital files?

Also, this was obviously filmed in a studio, so don't you dare be upset about the fakeness of the setting and staging. It's a made-for-TV movie from the 1960s. You know how recently ""Sound of Music"" and ""Peter Pan"" were live performances on TV? Those were filmed in a studio too.... in the 2010s. There's been an upgrade in technology and resources, but nevertheless, those are in a studio too. Keep that in mind.

Because this made-for-TV movie was recorded on film in 1965, you will see some cloudiness around the edges of the square frame, which is fine and natural AFTER 50 YEARS.

In regards to the actual movie, this was the version I watched constantly when I was younger. While I haven't seen the full Julie Andrews adaptation, which came out several years before this Leslie Ann Warren adaptation, I think this version holds a more realistic simplicity and beauty to the story of Cinderella. She's a beautiful, but simple girl who wins the prince over with her kindness first, beauty second. And, no, her voice isn't as wonderful as Julie Andrews', but it goes back to the simple and relatable beauty of this young girl who is treated poorly by her stepmother and obnoxious stepsisters.

Overall, I think it's a blessing this movie was transferred over a DVD in the condition that it's in. I haven't watched any of the extras, but the film is a perfect reminder of my childhood and what made it so simple and beautiful.",1430352000,63,2010,4.621848739495798

Knowing how much I looked for it and couldn't find it, my husband surprised me with it for my birthday this year. I wouldn't open it until my sister and her daughter and granddaughters were able to come over THEN....I turned it on and my sister began to cry! It was just like when we were kids and saw it for the first time. She is unable to do the waltz now but we sang every song!! What an awesome time we had sharing that moment in time again.

If you are a mom reading this, wondering if she should purchase this for her little girl, do so, without a doubt. Watch it with your girls.

2364219,1,B000A5SR46,"Cinderella was written for television at a moment when both of these excellent show biz people were temporarily off form. The music and lyrics are banal.. The story has been told better, before and since. Ginger Rogers and her consort have little to do, and can manage nothing much given their material. For disposal. we are looking for someone with a nine year old daughter who might welcome our copy",1425772800,,401,4.742857142857143

2364260,5,B000A5SR46,"As much as I adore Julie Andrews -- which is a LOT -- this is my favorite version of Rodger's and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella."" When I was little, I was allowed to stay up late as a child to watch this when it came on TV. I knew all tthe songs by heart, I could quote all the lines -- I WAS Cinderella, sitting in ""my own little corner, in my own little chair,"" daydreaming about all the adventures I read in books and knowing that nothing was ""Impossible,"" as long as I remained one of those ""daft and dewy eyed dopes, building up impossible hopes.""

This Cinderella had dark hair like me and in  the '60s and '70s, when it seemed like most of the princesses had blond hair (except Snow White, who slept through the best part of her story), this was awesome. In the 90's, I found this on VHS and relived my childhood memories -- and I still knew every song by heart. Later, when I looked for it in DVD, it wasn't available, but now, I have it and I can share this wonderful piece of my childhood with my own daughter.

The DVD is of very good quality and the picture and sound, though a bit echo-y, as one would expect from a live taping of a stage production, are just as I remembered. It's colorful, it's fun, and I highly recommend experiencing this beautiful production.",1425168000,2,1273,4.273858921161826

2364396,5,B000A5SR46,"For me this will always be THE Cinderella. While this version may be 50 years old, I watched it faithfully every year until CBS stopped showing it. Rogers and Hammerstein's songs are magical and wonderful and fit the story perfectly just like the glass slipper on Cinderella's foot. I own many versions of Cinderella. While this one may not have the technical wizardry of today, it is the cast that makes this one. Leslie Ann Warren makes her debut as Cinderella. Stuart Damon (General Hospital) shows off why I fell in love with his Prince and sings a song that was originally written for ""South Pacific"", but was cut from that show. Celeste Holm and Ginger Rodgers remind one of the Golden Age of Hollywood musicals and are still lovely as ever. Pat Carroll (Ursula from Disney's ""Little Mermaid"") is one of the stepsisters.

A bit of trivia... this show was originally done live in 1955 starring Julie Andrews and was CBS's answer to NBC having done ""Peter Pan"" the year before with Mary Martin. The music and songs were written for TV and until recently the show was never produced on Broadway. This 1965 version was done so that the show could be preserved for future generations.

So if you liked NBC's ""Sound of Music Live"" and ""Peter Pan Live!"", try this on for size. You might just be surprised and find yourself transported to the Ball.",1421193600,,1346,4.651260504201681

2364542,4,B000A5SR46,"I grew up with this 1965 version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's made-for-TV musical, and I love it. I got the 2002 Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment DVD as soon as it was available, and I've loved it all these years. But when I saw that there was a remastered new version with a better picture quality, I decided to upgrade. That's when I discovered a problem.

My 4-star review for this 5-star musical is for one reason only--the sound. The picture now is much better than on the earlier DVD, with clear images and brighter colors. BUT...the original 2002 disc was in Dolby Surround, using the stereo pre-recordings of the musical numbers and background music that were featured on the 1965 cast album from Columbia Records (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinderella-1965-Television-Cast/dp/B00000291S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinderella (1965 Television Cast)</a>). This new ""improved"" 2014 DVD from Shout Factory doesn't have that stereo soundtrack--they've replaced it with the original monaural TV audio tracks from 1965, and I have to wonder why they did that.

When the special was made for TV in 1965, the entire score was pre-recorded twice--once in 2-channel stereo for the inevitable original cast album that would be released to stores, and once in mono. The actual broadcast used the single, flat, monaural tracks for the monaural TVs of the time, and that's what we heard on TV in 1965 (I was 9 years old). The stereo record arrived soon after that, with a much fuller, more resonant sound quality. Not only were all the instruments of the orchestra and the voices of the chorus more clearly defined, but the principal voices were much improved by the dual amplification. Most particularly, the 2-channel Surround helped 18-year-old Lesley Ann Warren, whose lovely, light soprano voice sounded rather thin on the original monaural TV broadcast. She sounded much better on the record--and she sounded much better on the Columbia Tristar 2002 DVD. Now, this 2014 HD DVD gives us those old, flat mono tracks, and Warren sounds thin and insubstantial again. So does everyone else, for that matter. Why? Why didn't the people making the new DVD use the superior stereo tracks of the original DVD?

To hear the difference yourself on the new Shout Factory DVD, listen to the overture that was added to the cast album and the discs but never officially a part of the TV broadcast. It's in 2-Channel Dolby Surround on both versions. Then the actual program begins with the main titles, and from then on what you hear is in mono. If you can't hear the dramatic difference in sound quality between the overture and the program itself, you'll probably be fine with this new DVD. If you DO hear the difference--especially if you use headphones or earbuds--then you'll know why I'm complaining. The entire 2002 Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment disc sounds like that overture!

I appreciate the better picture quality, but I won't be watching this new Shout Factory DVD again. I'll stick with my 2002 Columbia Tristar DVD. The picture isn't quite as good, but that lush Dolby Surround soundtrack makes all the difference. If you can find a copy of the original DVD that isn't crazy expensive, you might also prefer it to this new version. (I'm a musician, and sound quality is more important to me than picture quality--this is a musical, after all.) Either way, it's a great show, possibly the best made-for-TV musical ever.",1418947200,3,3469,5.102112676056338

2364629,5,B000A5SR46,"If, like me, you are of a certain age and watched US TV, you probably grew up watching the 1965 version of Rodger's and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella."" Before VHS tapes or DVDs the only way to see it was the annual TV broadcast. Every year I'd eagerly anticipate it, sit entranced during it and then feel let down that I had to wait another year before seeing it again. Not anymore though thanks to modern technology of digital media. Digitally restored from the original source, this 50th Anniversary Edition looks far better than the DVD released in 2002. Softness has largely been eliminated and the colors are vibrant throughout. There is also a surprising level of detail. While it's nowhere near what you would see with a Blu-ray transfer, individual aspects of the costumes are viewable. I noticed only two spots where the frame noticeably jumped and one small scratch. The audio is presented in Dolby Surround, reworked from the original mono. There is plenty of action in the surrounds, but little in the way of directionality. Voices sound okay, though there is a certain shrillness on occasion, when the stepmother or her daughters speak to Cinderella. English subtitles and Closed Captioning are included.
The following extras are available: A Cinderella Story (9:50) Recorded in 2002, Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon and Celeste Holm discuss the production history of the special. Warren and Damon share some particularly interesting tidbits about getting their roles. This is definitely nostalgia at it's Best!",1416700800,6,1520,5.108433734939759

2364724,5,B000A5SR46,"There is no shortage of great performances of Rodgers & Hammersteins only musical created for television. Of course, there is the original 1957 CBS live telecast starring Julie Andrews, the recent Broadway show, a British panto starring Tommy Steele, a touring production with Eartha Kitt and the 1997 version starring Brandy and Whitney Houston.

Each version has its own special magic, but the 1965 version (now in its 30th anniversary year) starring Lesley Ann Warren has the distinction of being smack in the middle of an era spangled with full-color, escapist entertainment still dear to baby boomers. Premiering on February 22, 1965, the CBS special came along just as musicalslike Mary Poppinsseemed to be having a resurgence in Hollywood, and before such programming became pass&eacute; in the minds of many.

Pat Carroll, who became legendary as the voice of The Little Mermaids Ursula (and the original Mother Magoo), was an oft-welcomed presence on series TV, game and talk shows. In this production, Carroll played one of the stepsisters. The other sister was played by Barbara Ruick, who appeared as Carrie (Mr. Snow) Pepperidge in the movie version of Carousel. Ruick was the wife of composer John Williams, who among other projects at the time, was scoring episodes of Gilligans Island and Lost in Space (and that's not a diss -- his work elevated both shows). Sadly, Ruick passed away in 1972, before she could experience Williams colossal success with Star Wars and his other sweeping movie scores. Oscar and Tony winner Jo Van Fleet (East of Eden), properly snooty as the Stepmother, gives the suitable impression that she constantly smells  some very strong cheese.

R&H favorite Celeste Holm played the traditional fairy Godmother in 1965, in contrast to Edie Adams sassy fairy in the 1957 show. And the Prince was Stuart Damon, later to play Alan Quartermain on General Hospital (which included a prince nod in at least one script, maybe more). Damon reveals in the bonus documentary (from the previous DVD release) that Jack Jones dropped out of the show as the Prince, so he filled in at the last moment and it was a ""Cinderella story"" for him.

The production values, as far as the imaginative sets and costumes, is magnificent, but because TV was still relatively young, this videotaped production has some special effects that would make Electra Woman and Dynagirl sneer, especially the flying horses (from a Marx ""Best of the West"" playset?) and the final materialization of Holm, whose chroma-key glitch gives her have a ""Max Headroom"" spell.

No matter, the show is still first class and one of TV's all-time best, made back in a time when musical variety was still a major force. And the Columbia/Sony cast album is excellent, too, with a few bonus tracks on the CD/download and a great overture created just for the record by conductor Johnny Green.",1414108800,,2880,5.002087682672234

Things to remember:
This is a recording of a 1960's television show therefore the  quality is not as clear as some of us have become used to with the advent of HD tvs. In my opinion this adds to the charm.
I like that they kept it in the original ""square"" aspect ratio, this way you get to watch this classic they way that it was originally intended. It also included the original ""bumps"" that aired when going to and coming back from commercial, which was kind of cool.

2364823,4,B000A5SR46,"The most difficult thing to do when writing this column is to choose a single title to write about when so many good ones are being released that week. For instance this week. Do I write about season 4 of THE WALKING DEAD? Or what about the blu-ray release of the classic THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE? Then again season 2 or ELEMENTARY is just out as well. Fortunately you can read reviews of those releases online at the Digital Views blog. That's because I've chosen something nostalgic being released to write about this week.

RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN'S CINDERELLA first aired on CBS over 50 years ago. That's hard to believe. But a new DVD 50th anniversary edition has comes out this week and will bring back many fond memories for those who remember it. I remember it because in all honesty it was the first glimpse I had of Lesley Anne Warren who became my 6 year old crush. But that's not the reason this new DVD is worth picking up.

Certainly you all know the story of Cinderella already. The young girl who was treated poorly by her step-mother and step-sisters, forced to do the cleaning and cooking while they thought only of themselves. Who was given the chance by her fairy godmother to go to the ball, dance and romance the prince and later found to be the woman he was looking for when only her foot would fit the glass slipper he took across the country to find his one true love. Okay maybe I should have said spoiler alert but honestly if you don't know this story already something is wrong.

There had been various versions of the story produced, most famously the animated version done by the Disney Studios. In looking into this version I found that it had been done already for television back in 1957 with Julie Andrews starring. At the time shows were broadcast live so there is no copy of that version. That prompted CBS to remake the program in 1964, starring the then unknown Lesley Ann Warren in the lead role. This is the version just released on DVD.

Looking back it's amazing when you realize that at the time Broadway musicals were fairly common to be seen in television versions. While this was written specifically for television and not taken from Broadway, it still has that live performance feel to it as well as the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein music and lyrics. Today most kids have no idea who these two were but at the time they had the biggest set of Broadway hits ever found. For those of us who grew up with them we still remember their music and my guess would be you've hummed one tune or another by them in the past year if you're over 40.

The fantastic combination of what these two gentlemen brought together and were able to convey to videotape here is what makes this musical special. There is no overabundant amount of detail in everything from scenery to props to costumes. Everything seems so simple. There is no major league dramatic or political statement being made here. It's just a plain old love story with music to match. And yet it works on every level. It features fantastic music that you'll find yourself singing long after the DVD stops playing. While watching it I was amazed that after all these years I still remembered some of the lyrics to these songs, songs I hadn't heard in decades.

Today's kids face a jaded life filled with instant gratification in the forms of movies and music via things like downloads and Netflix. They have no concept of waiting to see a special or movie that only showed once a year or maybe one time only on TV. This show played yearly up until 1974. Now that it's on DVD it means those of us who enjoyed it can watch it every year we want if not more often. I know my plans are to have my great niece and nephew sit and watch it with me. That's the beauty of these classics being made available this way. It also gives me the chance to let them know about how we used to wait.

Major kudos goes to Shout Factory for releasing this version complete with a short retrospective from the past remaining casts filmed several years back. The quality of the DVD is fantastic and is sure to provide countless hours of entertainment for all who buy a copy. Once again they've outdone themselves with a release that might have been forgotten otherwise. Instead we now have the chance to enjoy it once more. With any luck a new generation will be exposed to it's beauty and consider looking into the other classics from Rodgers and Hammerstein. One can only hope.",1411948800,29,4454,4.491358024691358
2364824,5,B000A5SR46,I just get a kick out of the stepsisters. I love it and was able to share it with my 8 year old granddaughter. She liked it too. I'm glad I was able to fine it threw you. Thank you,1411948800,,180,3.525
2364825,5,B000A5SR46,"For me, this will always be THE version of Cinderella.

I was five when Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella came out and - ever since - I have had a crush on Lesley Ann Warren. In this version of the timeless classic, Lesley is radiant. No actress before or since has so embodied the innocence and magic of a role - and she captured my heart because of it.

Production-wise, don't look for Disney standards. This is not a multi-million dollar production with CGI, special effects, and animation. It looks like an old 1960s-era Hallmark Hall of Fame production with cheap sets and garish costumes. It's, essentially, little more than a filmed stage production. You can almost see the wires and joists holding up the backdrops.

But, O the Magic!

That's where this version of Cinderella succeeds. It is the epitome of childhood magic, of dreams come true. In those respects, it is priceless.

Helping to weave that spell is a cast that's quite respectable for a made-for-TV movie. In addition to Lesley, this movie features Stuart Damon as the prince, Celeste Holm as the fairy godmother, Ginger Rogers as the queen, and Walter Pidgeon as the king...and songs that haven't left my head in half a century. The Rodgers & Hammerstein score is so much fun!

To watch this version of Cinderella today (as I am this evening), requires imagination, and a desire to be see the world through a child's eyes. I can attest to both.

I am 54 years old. But I am five again when I watch this version of Cinderella.

I couldn't ask for more from a movie than that.

This is a treasure.",1411862400,206,1569,4.615107913669065

2364827,5,B000A5SR46,"After many years of my completely wore out copy of VHS issue sitting on the shelf, & disgusted with the extremely high price of DVD issue in the past many years, it's been some time since I've had the chance to go back to memory lane with a fine musical tightly packaged & executed as much as I enjoyed watching The Wizard of Oz back in the day when they featured these productions annually to every kids delight.
When my VHS copy wore out I kept it safe on my video shelf never touching it because I knew I would not be satisfied with a damaged copy. Yet, I didn't throw it away, and from time to time, would still be shocked by how much money it would take to replace it. I simply would not spend $80 to do it, & that kept me on hold for many years.
Now, after waiting so long, I browsed once again to be delightfully surprised by this digitally restored 50th anniversary edition & preordered it along with another hard to find production, Ray Bradbury's The Halloween Tree.

There is some blurriness, especially on the left side of the screen but it's not constant - it comes and goes.  That is somewhat to be expected with TV of this era as well as it's among the early attempts in producing in color.

The movie itself is wonderful!  Typical of Rodgers and Hammerstein productions, the music is just incredibly ""singable"" (even if you can't carry a tune in a bucket).

Yes, the picture quality is improved: It is a sharper picture with more vibrant colors. However, the vertical lines on the left side of the screen and the rounded corners suggest that the same kinescope was used. You can do only so much with a master that is bad from the get-go.

The audio track is still very weak and tinny sounding. It's still awful.

Worse yet: only one very brief (under 10 minutes) ""retrospect"" as a bonus. THAT is the best Shout! could do on a major 50th anniversary. There is nothing additional included. Boo!

2364902,5,B000A5SR46,I cannot wait for this movie to be re-released.  I watched at Christmastime when I was a little girl.  I have been looking for it for a long time.  I will be purchasing this movie.,1407974400,,180,4.085714285714285

2364904,5,B000A5SR46,"Well this is an oldie.  The music is great.  I wanted to present a different view to my grandchildren when I gave them Barbie Cinderella characters to play with.  I do think they were a little bored with Rodgers and Hammerstein's version.  But they did like Ginger Rogers dancing, and the costumes.

I remember Ginger Rogers as a kid.  So for me it was a walk down memory lane.",1405987200,,377,4.391304347826087

2364906,5,B000A5SR46,"I loved watching this on video every year. I would watch it at least twice a year. I wanted to buy it on DVD a long time ago, but it was over 50 dollars. I'm just so happy to find out that it's coming out on DVD for less than 20 dollars. Not that I didn't like the video, but the video looks like it might not make it. That's why I only watch it twice a year on video, so it doesn't ware out. I've always loved this show. I love the songs in this Cinderella more than the ones on the cartoon Cinderella. If you've never seen this movie, you should buy this movie, when it comes out.",1401667200,,582,3.8583333333333334
2364907,5,B000A5SR46,"I originally watched this when I was a teenager--the market they brought in Lesley Warren for. Stuart Damon as Prince Charming seems a bit old for Warren, though. Maybe late 20's to her 18-or-so. No overhype of the ""wicked stepmother"", which the Disney version tried to make as scary as Oz's Wicked Witch (""Malificent"", who I see has been given a spinoff of her own recently, half a century later). Just a second wife who didn't get along well with her husband's kids from the previous marriage and being a bit rhymes-with-itchy towards them. I was able to relate to that--back then my own father had recently remarried and us kids couldn't stand her. It was good to see a fairy tale that didn't make the good guys goody-goody and the bad guys nearly satanic. But maybe that's a fringe benefit of a version that targets a market not necessarily limited to little kids.

Good music too, which was always a ""no kidding Sherlock"" with Rodgers & Hammerstein. I had been trying for years to remember where the song came from which had the lines; ""Do I love you because you're wonderful...or are you wonderful because I love you"". And sure enough, it was from this show. As are classics like the amusingly ""meow-esque"" duet ""A Girl Like That"" between the stepsisters, and of course the wistful solo ""My Own Little Corner"" which is the ""big hit"" of this show--the lament of a girl maintaining a low profile in a dysfunctional family.",1400630400,,1426,4.658730158730159
