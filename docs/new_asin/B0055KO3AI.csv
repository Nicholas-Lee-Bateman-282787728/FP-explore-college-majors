This is set in WW II England. The Major talks about a failed operation. Next we see a party in a mansion. The Major gets a gift - an engraved Zippo lighter. Major James Wilson's plan ""Mad Dog"" is being considered again. The previous attack lost 80% of its soldiers. That Big Dock services the Nazi surface fleet, its destruction would be a victory for the Allies. There is conflict over this audacious plan. The Prime Minister approved it. Masked soldiers show their expertise in climbing and using a Sten gun. They will attack on a moonless night. Will Wilson get the equipment he wanted? What is expendable? Sailors carry explosives to the ship. Soldiers jump from ship to shore. A training accident? Too realistic? There are trade-offs in the military, as is business. They find a replacement Naval officer. The ship sails at night, a complete black-out is in effect. An enemy aircraft attacks them. The German officers are being entertained. ""Just routine.""

Their mission is to destroy the dock by ramming it then seek alternate targets. If they can't reach the boat they will find the French underground. Will they get air support? Will a signal change their plans? ""Standing on a bridge is different from sitting behind a desk."" ""It's a war we have to win."" The ships are detected. Their signal is ""Whitehall 1212"". The enemy sounds their alarm sirens. Commandos attack the enemy in a surprise attack. The RAF sent bombers to attack. [Flying too low?] Guns open fire at the ship which fires back. Submachine guns fire for action! Soldiers drop. The ship is too close for the Nazi guns to hit. ""Stand by for ramming!"" The Commandos leave the ship. There is more machine gun fire and dropping bodies. The attack continues. The wheelhouse suffered a direct hit. Will this affect the timing device? What if the wires were cut? The superior numbers of the enemy begin to tell. The British Captain is captured and brought before the Nazi Commander. Then that ship explodes! ""There's your answer."" The signal to retire is fired. ""Mission Accomplished."" [You assume the remaining soldiers and sailors escaped back to England.]

Did anything like this ever happen in history? If not, it's still a good action story (that avoids the other events from that time). Was it meant to be a copy of some earlier war movie? It is good, even if about average. Does it seem too relaxed compared to other movies? A good story makes a good movie. You can compare it to earlier movies. There was no mention of war-time rationing or other events of that era. The real target at that time was the submarine docks which did the most damage to Allied shipping. German capital ships were not a big problem (""Sink the Bismarck"").",1387756800,,2750,4.736951983298539
