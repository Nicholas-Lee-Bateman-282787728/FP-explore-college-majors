2690787,1,B000KGH0A2,"I happened to watch this episode and decided to watch this show regularly because of it.

The episode centered on Schneider's character throwing himself in front of a race car on a photo shoot to get a date with two tire models. The girls then show up at the apartment and hilarity actually ensues. Schneider was particularly funny in this episode.

So I started watching the show and quickly became very disappointed. It was downhill from there. So if you think it's worth buying the whole set for one laugh-out-loud episode, have at it.",1165622400,,538,4.712765957446808
2690788,5,B000KGH0A2,"I totally love this show and was mad as h---! when it was taken off. Why do studios put shows up against high rated shows on other networks is beyond me. Especially when they are starting out. Rob has some of the best comedic ablility in the business. It surely showed in this show and in all the movies he's done. I hope he looks for another venue someday in tv, but am glad he is entertaining us in the movies. Thank so much for bring this show to DVD, I will definitely buy it.

2690789,4,B000KGH0A2,"I've been waiting for this comedy to be released on DVD for quite some time. Several years ago, I heard of it's impending release, only to find out it was the British Men Behaving Badly show. I was disappointed, to say the least. I was 16 when this show was on, but remember watching it every week. I also enjoyed Drew Carey and a Fred Savage-led show called ""Working"".

This show was basically the bachelor roommate that technically had been done several times before with varying degrees of results. The comedy was crude (especially for that period), but funny. One bit I remember, was when Jamie (Schneider's character), not finding any coffee filters, uses his underwear to make him morning coffee. Stupid, yes. Funny, definitely. Ron Eldard, played his buddy Kevin and Justine Bateman played Sarah.

The reason the show only gets 4 stars: Probably due to either lack of faith, lack of money, or lack of ratings (due to going up against The Cosby Show), Bateman and Eldard took off leaving Schneider carrying the comedic load with some less funny characters. The show was yanked off the air early in its second season. The good news with this DVD release, is the addition of 7!! never-before-seen episodes from season 2. Now I'm not sure if that's good or bad due to the quality of acting, but still a joy nonetheless. I will be purchasing this one and will laugh my [...] off. Cheers!",1164931200,13,1389,4.688524590163935

2690840,5,B000KGH0A2,"I thought that this television show was very funny. Ken Marino was my favorite character in this series!! When Scott Layne guest starred on this show, I felt that this was the best show of the entire series!! ""Men Behaving Badly"" showed how the typical chicanery of the single male manifested itself through getting involved in situations which they would not get into if they thought clearly... Even if your typical guy has a good head on his shoulders, he usually does not think with his head, what he thinks with is not very bright at all, BELIEVE ME!!.. The comic relief on this show was more than adequate for a prime time television slot, and most people I know really found this show to be extremely entertaining!!! ""Men Behaving Badly"" gets a definite thumbs up in my book!!",1377129600,,782,4.633093525179856

2690843,3,B000KGH0A2,"so many shows- I remember them being funny,and when I try to watch them again, I wonder- what did I see in this?

2690847,5,B000KGH0A2,"OK I guess that isn't really fair to call it toilet humor but that sounded better than calling it man humor that revolves around typical guy issues such as sitting around drinking beer and watching sports while discussing the female sex. This show reminds me why I really miss the tv sitcom in this day and age of fantasy or reality tv. This show was plain fun back in the days when ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" were still funny- and still on. Rarely do I find a show that makes me laugh out loud but I do believe every episode of this show made me about wet my pants. Unfortunately, when Ron Eldard (as well as Justine Bateman) departed the show, the laughter went too. That was too bad b/c this show was so well-written and so funny- the characters and the dialogue and the situations were nothing less than lovable and amusing. Even watching it over a decade later, I still find it just as funny as I did back in 1996. I have noticed that a lot of shows I loved when they were on are now not as good as ""way back when."" I still seem to find early eps of ""Seinfeld"" & ""Friends"" funny plus early eps of ""The Office"" & ""My Name Is Earl"" + ""Modern Family"" worth watching. ""Men Behaving Badly"" is a trip- if you are looking for some cheap funny entertainment that is ""cleaner"" than some of the more graphic shows on these days (i.e. ""The League"" is another funny man-show but more R-rated) you should invest in this show. A post-SNL Rob Schneider & a post-ER Ron Eldard are hilarious as best friends/roommates in this comedy adapted from the British sitcom. Too bad this one didn't last as long as its British sister (or brother?) show. As far as I'm concerned, once Ron Eldard left the show, it was over but with this set you are getting the whole series which continued to run for a few eps into a 2nd season with Eldard only guest-starring in the 1st ep to tie up the loose ends. So to make a long review even longer, this show is funny and well worth the $8 that I see it costs now. I paid $24.99 to get it when it first came out 3 years ago and I do not regret paying more. I still love laughing at this show. The quality is good. I had no problems with any dvds. There are no exciting extras so don't expect any commentaries etc. What you get is just the show but be glad since it took over a decade to get this amazingly funny show on dvd.
***updated note: closed captioning is surprisingly not available on this dvd- the only negative thing I have to say about it.",1322265600,2,2466,4.226694915254237

2690861,5,B000KGH0A2,"I remember loving this show years ago and mourned that it ended so suddenly. The writing was witty, sharp and had us men pegged down.

Watching these episodes now makes me wonder if it were shown again following or during the lineup of TWO AND A HALF MEN and BIG BANG THEORY if it wouldn't be a hit?  There hasn't been a funnier scene in a comedy than watching Jamie making coffee in the first episode.

These DVD's came quickly are in perfect condition. Very pleased",1283644800,4,467,4.406976744186046
2690862,5,B000KGH0A2,"If you like Rob Schneider, then you'll love this! I always liked his SNL character ""Richard Laymer"", the ""making copies"" guy, who, incidently, is spoofed in the 11th episode of the 2nd season ""Welcome to JaimeCo."" Schneider's Duece Bigalow character also made me laugh hysterically, though less so in the not-so-great sequel. So while looking through youtube video posts recently, I happened upon this show. I remembered that, back in 1996, a friend of mine told me he watched this show regularly. I never did see it while it was on, but the few episodes that I saw on youtube cracked me up! So I spent $6.00 here on Amazon and got the Complete Series. Shout Factory does a great job in releasing lesser known T.V. series, and I am glad that this one seen the light of day! Childish sometimes, crude MOST of the time, but very entertaining!

I, myself, preferred the 2nd season episodes. The first season was funny, but they were tinkering with it too much. Several actors came and went as new characters were written in, and then, written out of the series. Julia Campbell was in a handful of season 1 shows, but then left the series during season 1. I think that the cast and the characters of the 2nd season were much stronger, and I just wish that there could've been another season or two with this ensemble!

So, if you like Rob Schneider's type of comedy, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD set! It's worth every penny!",1267920000,,1428,4.552529182879377
2690863,4,B000KGH0A2,"I was a fan of the first season with Ron Eldard and Justine Bateman.  Like most of the reviewers here, I enjoyed their chemistry and I thought a number of the episodes were very funny (I used to watch them over and over on my VHS tapes until I lost them).  I also am glad to see it on DVD.  I discovered this show midway into the first season, and I missed the earlier (the ones with Julia Campbell) episodes.  I don't recall seeing these in syndication (don't know if this show even made it to syndication, so it is a real treat to see the first Season 1 episodes.  I also agree with a lot of the reviewers in that this show lost a lot of momentum with the departure of Ron Eldard and Justine Batemen.  I didn't really take to the replacements, and the show lost a lot of its humor (which for me was created by the interactions of Eldard, Schneider, and Bateman, as much as from the writing).

Even though I lost interest early into the Season 2 run, I did watch all of the Season 2 episodes this time around, and most of them were entertaining, just not as funny as the earlier Season 1 episodes.  If you watch the last unaired episode, Carpe Dino, you will see a very young Drake Bell (Drake & Josh).

Either way, if you enjoyed this show during the mid-90's, this DVD set will bring back these episodes, and you will also get to see the 7 unaired ones.",1242432000,2,1356,4.184615384615385
2690864,3,B000KGH0A2,The title says it all but I love Rob Schneider and will watch anything with him in it. Don't you just hate it when your enjoying a series then they [networks] decided to change [get rid of] actors and put in an actor or actors they think is best for the show. Here is an example of it here after the end of season one. Justine Bateman was a good actor for Rob to play off with and they should have written more stories around them but didn't. If you have a few extra bucks burning a hole in your pocket...pick it up.,1214956800,,516,4.019417475728155

It used to be my favorite show.  I am so excited that it now on DVD and I'm really looking forward to watching it all over again.

This show is not for everyone and you really need to appreciate this type of comedy to get into it.  I still remember some of the great lines from this show and wondered if it would ever be available.  I just got the DVDs and since my husband has never seen it, I'm looking foward to introducing it to him.",1193788800,4,603,3.861788617886179

2690867,5,B000KGH0A2,"This show is genius and was one of my favorites. The characters and writing was hilarious. Rob Schnieder was the star of the show, but when Ron Eldard and Justine Bateman left the show after the first season he missed the great chemistry he had with them and the show suffered. The replacements didn't have the same talent level and it felt like Schnieder was trying too hard to make up for it.

""Jamie, let me ask you something, okay? If a couple, say like Sarah and I, have a cooling-off period. What does that mean?""

""I'm sure it varies from relationship to relationship, but for me, it means you're shot out of a canon into a sea of FLESH.""
