7805309,5,6300213315,"If you're a VHS fan and sci-fi fan, these Star Trek tapes are a must have. This is the original, vintage, Star Trek. It may be a little tacky by today's production standards, but the story and acting still hold up and are great fun to watch.
This is your chance to see what the original Klingons looked like before they all got lumpy heads(big eyebrows and too much bronzer, lol).
Good story, good acting, fun TV revisited!",1381622400,,423,4.435897435897436
7805310,5,6300213315,Season One was so pivotal for the Star Trek universe. One important thing it did was establish the Romulans and the Klingons. This episode is so entertaining and very didactic. It is definitely in the Top Five of Season One.,1242345600,,224,4.625
7805311,5,6300213315,"Although two or three episodes (City on the Edge of Forever, This Side of Paradise) might be slightly better because of their emotional drama, this episode is the model for what Trek did best: use sci-fi to comment intelligently on current events and the human condition. At one level, it's an anti-war story. Docile aliens are technologically backward and have a stubborn pacifist philosophy, even in the face of a Klingon occupation. But as both Kirk and the Klingon commander learn, there's more to these people than meets the eye.

Yet there is much here beyond the obvious anti-war message. Above all, it's a comment on the Cold War. As the representative of freedom and democracy, Kirk spends most of the episode seeing things in black and white. From one point of view, he's right. Klingons ARE more oppressive, just as Stalin was. But look how arrogant and condescending Kirk is. Not satisfied with the Oganians' speed of development, he tries to push Federation help on them that (as it turns out) they don't have the slightest use for. Kirk acts like you must be an idiot not to become a Federation client state. If you're not with us, you're against us. Etc. Only at the end does Kirk see the light (literally).

Most delicious is the Klingon commander presented in the stand-out performance by John Colicos. (In ""Battlestar Galactica,"" Colicos would go on to essentially parody his own Trek character.) The Klingon side has imperialistic ambitions, but at least they are honest about it. And perhaps the Federation has given the Klingons genuine reason to push back. Near the end, Colicos protests, ""You've cut us off, hemmed us in."" No doubt. Consider America's actions in the Cold War and toward Japan prior to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Sure, we were the ""good guys,"" but we gave some people genuine reason not to like us.

All these meanings are layered into a great story. You can enjoy this episode for the way that the mystery unfolds and for Colico's highly entertaining, magnetic performance. Klingons (Worf included) were never again as compelling as this one. At the end of the episode ask yourself: who truly was on an ""errand of mercy"" -- the Federation or the Organians?",1188777600,,2198,4.824933687002653
7805312,5,6300213315,"""Errand of Mercy"" provides one of the most problematic story lines in Star Trek history.  The Federation and the Klingon Empire have started fighting again and the Enterprise hurries to Organia, a strategically important planet.  Wanting the cooperation of the Organians, Kirk and Spock beams down and find the universe's most passive people, who are not at all concerned that the big bag Klingons are coming.  The Klingons do show up, stranding Kirk and Spock on the planet where they are disguised as Organians and get to witness the arrival of Kor, the Klingon military governor.  Kirk and Spock begin a two-person resistance movement, blowing up Klingon supplies.  The Klingons retaliate against the population, but then Ayelborne, leader of the Organians, decides he has had enough of all this nonsense.  One of the things I most like about ""Errand of Mercy,"" is that it is one of the few times that the Enterprise encounters a race of superior beings who are not seriously flawed in some way.  You even get Kirk put in the uncomfortable position of insisting on the right to make war and kill millions of people.  This also becomes one of the most problematic episodes in Star Trek history, because the Organian Peace Treaty makes it impossible for the Federation and Klingon to go on killing each other.  At least in theory (you have to admit, they have the enforcement capabilities); in practice, the two civilizations would continue to have fun with each other in future Star Trek episodes.",1003017600,6,1499,4.916666666666667
7805313,4,6300213315,"John Colicos turns in a standout performance as Kor, the first Klingon to appear in the series. Kor is strong, cunning, ruthless, and a little bit charming. The peaceful Organians are also very compelling characters. Throughout the episode, there is just a hint that there is more to the Organians than meets the eye.
There is some action in the story, along with a little suspense, but it would have been nice if there was a little more of both. Additionally, we are never shown the Klingon vessel.
In spite of these flaws, this is a very good episode with a very strong supporting cast. A definite must for any Star Trek fan.",998524800,3,627,4.557522123893805
7805314,4,6300213315,"This was the episode that introduced the Klingons with an excellent performance by John Colicos of Battlestar Gallactica. Kirk and Spock land on a very placid planet with a society reminiscent of Medevil Europe  finding it to be overrun by Klingons and the inhabitants remaining  amazingly passive about it. Kirk and Spock disguise themselves as citizens,  but the Klingons soon find out their true nature. This is apparently the  only episode with the exception of the first two that Dr. McCoy didn't  appear in, for some reason. I guess he was on leave.",964828800,5,555,4.924731182795699
7805315,5,6300213315,"Kirk and Spock beam down to the surface of planet Organia to negotiate for the erection of a Federation base on that planet. Hostilities between the nearby Klingon Empire and Federation have reached alarming heights and it  is feared that the medieval culture of the Organians will not be able to  withstand a Klingon attack. However, the Organian Counsel, comprised of  five seemingly pleasant, benign elderly men, insist that they prefer to  stay with their more primitive culture.  When Kor and his Klingon force  attack the planet, Kirk and Spock go undercover as Organian and Vulcan  traders. They are captured by the Klingons, and to their surprise, the  Organians free them with ease. In turn, the Klingon ship and the U.S.S.  Enterprise square off to battle in orbit of the planet.  Displeased by the  outbreak of violence, the Organians reveal themselves to be powerful  creatures of pure energy who easily neutralize the weapons on both ships,  thus ending the threat for the moment.  Back on the U.S.S. Enterprise, Kirk  feels certain that the Organians will not only take care of themselves in  the future, but monitor their surroundings for any hint of hostilities.",947462400,,1178,5.025906735751295
