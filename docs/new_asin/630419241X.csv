804152,5,630419241X,I purchased this DVD after viewing the show on TV.  The primary lesson I believe it teaches children is treasured items do not have to cost alot. A very important lesson in these days and times.,1209945600,,194,4.388888888888889
804153,5,630419241X,"Captains Courageous  DVD

Captain Courageous is updated version of a story by Rudyard Kipling<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captains-courageous-Kipling-dollar-library-for-young-moderns/dp/B00085CVWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Captains courageous."" (Kipling dollar library for young moderns)</a>.  In the movie, staring Robert Urich as a fishing boat's captain, and Kenny Vodas as a young, spoiled rich boy who falls overboard from a cruise liner and is rescued by a fishing boat and is required to work if he wants to eat is a great story about growing up.

Highly recommended for any family who has a young teenage boy that is not use to minding his manners, respecting his elders, and doing chores  as a responsibility.

Warning has a ""tear-jerking"" ending.

804154,5,630419241X,"the remake has been a staunch family favorite since since we watched it some years ago at chritmastime. since then we look out for when it will be shown on tv as well as the remake of miracle on 34th street, a little princess etc. this year I decided to purchase the DVD.however when I purchased it thru a supplier listed on amazon I received a VHS item that was in a brown envelope with no proper packaging and the item was damaged. now I have to call barnes and noble.
amazon should be more careful about who they allow to promise products thru their secure website.",1200700800,,568,4.317757009345795

A very appropriate selection for school age children...and children of all ages!",1198972800,,287,4.5
804156,1,630419241X,"I had very low expectaions for this film from the outset, and I was not disappointed.  Kipling's classic is one of my favourite books, and the Fleming movie as well (but I have a few issues with that too).  I don't get why every version of this film has to have people getting killed or maimed.  This is the third version of this film, and each remake has been a step down from the one before.  Sure, the best is the 1937 version...at least there's real fishing, and great sailing.  The 1977 version had lots of potential, but it fell short in so many ways...this version didn't even try.  I think Robert Urich could have made a very good Disko Troop (why Matt in this film?) if only he had been given a script and director/producer who had a clue about what Kipling was writing about.  Instead he was dealt an appalling waste of ink and paper by some overpaid hack (if he was paid a nickel it was too much) and the whole show is a complete shambles.  Even the poor ""We're Here"" is a lousy performer, she is obviously a yacht, and so far from an american vessel, to say nothing of a fishing schooner as to give me the screaming heebie jeebies.  It is hard to convey the desolation of the Grand Banks when you can see mountains in the background.  I have no experience in movie making, but I am sure I could make a much better film than this one...anyone who wants to fund the project can find out.  I'll even write the script....it can't be worse than this.  This film is a Hallmark of Shame production.",1141689600,6,1503,4.290780141843972
804157,1,630419241X,"The original movie (available on VHS I believe) is MUCH better than this remake.

The original shows how a pain in the backside kid gets 'straightened out' by fisherman who save his life in the 1930's (the sailing scenes are increadible)..

The remake is an aboniation - a ship full of touchy feely sweet and kind sailers that nurture the brat in to a more acceptable social frame of mind.  BS!

The producers of this monstrosity should be shot.  See the original if you want to see a good flick!

804158,2,630419241X,"I fail to understand how a 1996 remake of this movie can be on DVD before the original. I have never seen the remake, and will likely never. A remake, no matter how good, can only taint Spencer Tracey's performance.
Release the ORIGINAL verison! Please.",1052092800,18,253,4.644444444444445
804228,5,630419241X,"Excellent story for helping youngsters see how respect and a change in attitude can change the direction of one's life.
It's a different story from original, which doesn't bother me. Each is a good and wholesome story for young and old alike.",1396915200,,242,4.785714285714286

804230,2,630419241X,"Since I really enjoyed the Karl Malden version of Captain's Courageous. I was expecting something as good or better than that. In the TV version, the captain and all the crew had personalities and were excited about being fisherman.  In this version, none of the personalities grabbed me, and the story cane off kind of blah as a result.",1367625600,2,337,4.711864406779661

804234,4,630419241X,"We have two different versions of 'Captains Courageous' movie and each one is unique. My husband likes old western, comedy and old action flicks, whereas I prefer movies that are based on non-fiction, historical, comedy, musicals, classics and chic flicks. I have to admit we both loved this movie. The acting and the story line were very well done. We have enjoyed both version. Comparing this one to the other, this one stood up equally.",1280361600,,439,4.866666666666666

804236,2,630419241X,"I read the book ""Captains Courageous"" by Rudyard Kipling (great book, excellent message, very difficult language) with my children.  Knowing they missed much of the story, we watched this movie to fill in the blanks for them.

What a waste!  We were disappointed in many ways.  They changed the story terribly!  In the book Harvey is not an orphan, his best friend doesn't die, and the captain is an excellent role model, not some ultra-distant and sometimes emotionally outraged man.  It was horrible!  We all agreed that the storyline was far better as originally written.  It wasn't a case of a few minor details being changed, the entire virtue of the story was diminished.  Why?  Why?  Why?

Looks like there is a 1937 version we'll have to try.  Back then I'm sure it was okay to teach life lessons about working hard, growing up, and appreciating family without needing to write them out of the storyline or making it really cheesy in the process.",1257724800,11,954,4.7439024390243905

The casting in this fllm was fine; all the actors were quite convincing as their characters. But the screenplay was horrible. i can't imagine why the details of the story were changed so much, when it's such a great story as originally written!

Robert Urich is patient beyond belief and such a wonderful example for the rich orphaned spoiled boy who has fallen into his lap, or onto his schooner.
