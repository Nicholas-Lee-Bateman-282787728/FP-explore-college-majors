8493005,5,B0064X1G5A,"I have the Rubinstein/Previn DVD of the Piano Concerto 2. It is simply perfect, but this version has something special. Ohlsson has the technique, but also the feeling, not the overacting style of Lang Lang, but the perfect measure of the Choping feeling with the demanding technique. A must-have for any lover of Chopin.",1428019200,,321,4.962962962962963
8493006,5,B0064X1G5A,"In this recording Garrick Ohlsson steers a satisfying mid-course between the exhilaration of Kissin in the second concerto and the reflection of Demidenko in the first concerto which is to be found on a rival issue. Both issues share the talents of the conductor Antoni Wit with the Warsaw Philharmonic.

Whereas the Kissin/Demidenko release offers two very contrasting approaches to performing these two concerti, this issue provides a more balanced approach - not surprisingly as it is the same pianist for both works. Ohlsson is a very experienced Chopin player having won first prize at the Chopin International Competition as long ago as 1970.

Essentially Ohlsson brings a lyrical approach to these concertos in contrast to the bravura demonstrated by Kissin. However this lyrical approach has a firmer and tougher underpinning than the reflective Demidenko so that moments of climax bite harder. His technique is flawless and this uniformity of approach may well be a deciding factor for many listeners.

There are other works on this disc in the form of a Mazurka encore and an opening orchestral piece by Moniuszko with the title of `The Fairy Tale'. This is pleasant enough but hardly a deciding matter for considering this recording.

More importantly, this disc comes with an absorbing and informative supporting documentary, `The Art of Chopin'. This is an historical coverage of Chopin's life and creative development and which is copiously illustrated by musical excerpts played by many of the foremost Chopin pianists - a veritable feast of outstanding Chopin pianism. The documentary is a particularly fascinating piece of work through which we are guided with an authoritive commentary and explanation provided by Ohlssohn.

The quality of the recording is excellent throughout with crisp and sympathetic imaging that is detailed without being intrusive. The sound in DTS is equally excellent. This disc is highly recommended therefore.",1342224000,5,1954,5.351791530944626
8493007,5,B0064X1G5A,"I have owned the Chopin concerti by Demidenko/Kissin with this same orchestra-conductor combo for about a year. They are excellent performances by entirely different style pianists.

A year prior to that recording was this one with Garrick Ohlsson, playing both concerti, and is was coupled with a very good documentary on Chopin ""The Art of Chopin"". Some reviewers of this dvd-only release complained about the sound of the orchestra. This new bluray release has apparently cleared up that problem, at least using the DTS MASTER AUDIO selection. I found it excellent, extremely full and clear. I did find the orchestral opening of the #1 a bit prosaic, with little jauntiness. However, as the concerto progressed, matters improved dramatically. Ohlsson has a wonderful touch with Chopin, and it is no exaggeration to say that he transports you to another place with his delicate and sensitive playing. Time stands still, at least for me. Concerto #2 is no less impressive.

If you are looking for barnstorming performances, this will not be your cup of tea. These are time-honed, reflective outings by a man who loves Chopin and is not afraid NOT to show off for the sake of it. There are multitudes of Chopin virtuosi who  are heavy on technique but have a dearth of ""soul"". I am not a pianist, but I am in awe of artists like Garrick Ohlsson.

I have not heard the well-reviewed Barenboim set, but I'm told it, too, is special. We should be so lucky!

I bought this from Amazon UK. The delivered price for bluray was less than $30. When you buy from them, your cart price will be about $5 less than advertised. Plus they often offer faster releases than Amazon USA.

Well worth your consideration!",1327017600,8,1700,4.804794520547945
