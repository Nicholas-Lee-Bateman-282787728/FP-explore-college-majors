7973946,4,B0000714DC,I liked how Jeremy Jordan is different from the pop star image on his album. He's more dressed down and innocent so it's very sweet and cute. I think Jeremy Jordan fans will like it and maybe even love it. Nice little movie that you just might enjoy.,1253404800,,250,4.229166666666667
7973947,3,B0000714DC,"There was a lot of hard work and love put into this film.  However, for me it did not show.  The use of red & picture framing did not read for me either.
I also could not get into the two main characters.
I do own the DVD and will have to give it another look.
For me the film was gloomy and slow.
Rent it before you buy it.

7973948,1,B0000714DC,"I guess there are 1000's of movies like this in the video stores that noone wants to rent.  The title is unattractive and conveys the film maker's state of mind-----dreamer.  The concept and storytelling are not original, a little bit of this and that, here and there: such a stereotype film-making technique from some amateurs who are trying to overwhelm the viewers with such mediocre production.  Low budget is not an issue here though, but the movie does look low budget, simply because the story itself is insufficient to augment a low budget production.  The writer (from China) obviously does not understand the thinking of typical Americans and how Americans perceive Hollywood.  Anyway...I find this flick completely overrated.",1045699200,3,736,5.203389830508475
