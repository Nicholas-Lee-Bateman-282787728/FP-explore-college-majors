4602218,5,B0058YPL66,"this by far is the best show that i have seen on abc since the old ""one saturday morning"" cartoon line up and ""TGIF' line up and the sunday 7 or was it 8 o clock disney movie presentation that they had in the past . I have to say it is a breath of freassh air and it is nice to already know the characters from all of our favoriate story books. i absolutely love this show and this was just the pilot.it makes me wounder about the season. I know have a found wonderful sunday night show and i can not wait til its sunday the second episode. 5 out 5 stars isn't enough..i would give them 10 all accross.very pleased",1319328000,,614,4.0
4602219,5,B0058YPL66,"The idea of this whole show intrigued me when I first read about it under the fall 2011 season previews.  The whole idea is amazing.  The fairy tale world they created was stunning and breathtaking, I can't wait to see more of it in the coming episodes.  It started out with the kissing of Snow White, which is a classic.  I was unsure of whether or not I was going to like Josh Dallas as Prince Charming, but I must say that he grew on me as the first episode explored both the real world and the fantasy world.  It did start out slightly slower than I expected, but after watching it twice, I understand why it did so.  The show, as the writers have said, is character driven, and they had to set up the characters.  Emma Stone is an interesting figure.  I like the idea that we get to see our favorite storybook characters after the weddings.  And, it's interesting enough that even my nine year old nephew liked it.  So, I have to give this a good review.  I can't wait for the next episode, because now the characters are set up, and you know where they are in the real world, and what happened to them in the fairy tale world to get them there.",1319328000,14,1150,4.205479452054795
4602220,3,B0058YPL66,"Despite its weak opening sequence, which begins with the obligatory text-on-screen storytelling, and the jarring jumps between past and present, Once Upon A Time definitely has the potential to be something unique and entertaining...but only if the creators (and editors) are willing to do some work. The storyline, which I admit to being intrigued by initially, only began to become engaging towards the end, with the rest of the episode feeling like a filler that could have easily been used in other episodes to build up the tension and intrigue. As it stood, I found some of the back-and-forth a little silly and over done, with not enough time given to either the past or present to really become attached to any of the characters. While I do plan to continue to watch, I can only hope that this first episode will be the weakest of the lot.",1319241600,2,846,4.722972972972973
4602221,3,B0058YPL66,Not bad - so far. Under the same genre as another show (Grimm) - fairytales intertwined with present day - but not as gory.  Doesn't list which network the show is under. I am waiting for the next episode to give a better rating.,1319241600,2,229,4.204545454545454

4602266,5,B0058YPL66,"After casually watching Once Upon a Time's later seasons, I was ready to grab some popcorn and laugh at, what I assumed the train wreck of a first season would be. Surprisingly, I found myself not only enjoying it but thoroughly engaged in the character's stories and wanting to know what will happen next. The mix of ""real world"" character drama and fairytale stories was just fun to watch, even if the fairytales were more of an original story rather than a retelling of their book or movie counterpart. The story, for the most part, was obviously thought out in it's entirety (with the exception of the last few episodes but i'll get to that) as the episodes fit together seamlessly. So much so, that, if you were to cut it down a little, it would feel like a really long movie rather than a television show.

However, despite all the good, this season has many, MANY flaws.

First of all, the introduction and then immediate dismissal of characters. Maleficent was a blink and you'll miss it addition which only served to be the ""big showdown"" moment for Emma. Honestly, that wasn't the big showdown we all wanted. And Maleficent plays such a small role and defeated so easily, she could have been replaced with anyone and it wouldn't have mattered. Cinderella got her own episode but then was never spoken of again, making me wonder why she was needed in the first place as they could have used that time to expand on the world or characters. Hansel and Gretel, of whom was just a plot device to fuel Emma's character development and then promptly disappeared. And Finally, the Mad Hatter/Jefferson. Who played more of a role than the others previously mentioned but also got very little time to actually do anything other than be a catalyst for the plot to move along. I'm sure there were other characters, but they are treated so insignificantly that I don't even remember them or feel it's pointless to bring them up.

 Second of all, the reason for the ""curse"". The whole reason for the show to exist. Evil Queen/Regina's hate for Snow White. The writers attempted, in her backstory, to make her a sympathetic character. But then it fails when we are shown the actual reason why she has become the person she became. It makes no sense. It's such an out of nowhere moment, contradicting what they were trying to establish in the previous scenes, that is makes my scratch my head in confusion. Had there maybe been some time devoted to her backstory before, where we could have maybe seen some kind of evil tendencies, it would have been understandable. But, as it is, it made no sense for a plot point that big.

And finally, the last few episodes. While I mentioned before the show being one big cohesive narrative that runs more like a movie, the last couple episodes are the exception. Emma doesn't believe, the plot forces her to suddenly have flashbacks to events weren't even hers followed by a bunch of fanfiction-esque events that aren't connected at all. And then there's a lack of magic but a magical beast in the basement that she has to go fight? But then Jefferson suddenly knows something he shouldn't? And then oops there's magic because of a potion made of true love? And why wasn't this used previously? And if there's no magic why did the ""magic well"" have magic? And even if so, how does a true love potion bring back magic? What is going on and why? Honestly, the last couple episodes are so rushed, so nonsensical that it's like the show has made it almost to the finish line only to trip at the last second. None of it made sense. It was a mess. That being said, however, the ending is at least one that wraps up the story nicely as well as sets up (albeit rather poorly) the next season.

Overall, i'd recommend fans of dramatic character-driven stories with a fantasy twist give this a go. Almost everything about this season is great. If you can get past the rather iffy ending episodes, i'd give it a shot.

Now, i'm off to season 2. We'll see where we go from here.",1505692800,,4000,4.562674094707521

4602270,2,B0058YPL66,"I like the stories about the fairy tales but the stories about the people in the town of Storybroke, Maine, I find them kind of dragging and not very interesting. It has too much of melodrama. I like the story about the Prince Charming and Snow White.  Most of the time, I find the story line for the mayor and sheriff  boring.  The character of Mr. Gold is weird and I don't like him at all.  The story revolving the characters of David, Mary Margaret and Katherine are okay.  It's just about them that it keep me going.  Other than that, I find it so disappointing.",1502064000,,567,4.30188679245283

4602321,3,B0058YPL66,"I'm surprised this series has gotten so many five star reviews.  It's just an okay show.  It's entertaining enough to keep me watching, but it just doesn't hold up to better shows like Supernatural and Grimm.  Some acting in this show is good.  Other acting, not so much.  The story line is creative - making the fairy tale world real and ours make-believe.  I can also see hidden, deeper meanings like revenge comes at a price - the evil queen killing the thing that she loved to seek revenge - the deeper meaning being when you seek revenge, you end up making yourself unhappy.  I also loved the humor in the pilot when Snow White asks the Evil Queen where they're going and she says some place horrible, absolutely horrible, and then she takes them to Maine, lol.  But the problem I have with this series is that so many scenes are so juvenile, it risks becoming a fairy tale soap opera.  If they could fix that, it would be a lot better.",1501459200,,941,4.393063583815029

4602463,5,B0058YPL66,"Once Upon A Time (OUAT) is full of magic, and surprises, and has an unusual sense of humor. Whenever the characters get thrown a curveball they find a way to overcome it without damaging or hurting anyone. This world came to be because the evil queen opened a portal to find the savior, this world is located in Storybook, Maine, these characters live in parallel worlds. In one world they are modern people, and then in the other world they are like fairy tale characters .
The main characters are Mary Margaret who is also known a Snow White, she is fearless, confident and always trying to make peace with the evil queen. Regina Mills is also known as The Evil Queen, she is constantly trying to get rid of Snow White, and fools people with her dark magic. Emma Swan is The Savior, she did not know that she was the savior till she was in her late 20s she learns how to use her magic for the good. Mr. Gold is also known as Rumpelstiltskin, knows everyone, and everything comes with a price with him.
These Characters will give you at the edge of seat moments with Disney stories with a evil and dark twist that make them a lot better. These characters and the twisted plot line keep you constantly at the edge of your seat wanting more; these characters are not like your average Disney fairy tales, they are more realistic characters that go through real life problems and not like Disney which go through one hard time and then live happily ever after. Furthermore, these characters  have amazing costumes that make the characters more in character, these costumes are bold and amazing, they describe the character and their attitude.
The backgrounds and the green screening is also amazing, they take time to work out the detail of the backgrounds and the workers hard work shows through. These characters also have amazing makeup; Mr.gold is also Rumpelstiltskin and when he has his makeup on it is done very well because they spend a lot of time to perfect the art of getting it just right. They turn Rumple from an average man to a monster with a lot of makeup. I like this show because of the fairy tales with a twist to make them so much better and the characters that all are hiding secrets that could be dangerous.  This 60 minute and the 6 seasons show is full of magical thrillers. From the first show on you will from likes and dislikes towards some characters and as the show goes on you will question their decisions and their actions. In summary this show targets people who have creative minds and love romantic twists.",1484870400,,2540,4.531590413943355

Love the animation quality in this series, and the spin on some of our favorite Disney/Grim tales. Only thing I wasn't too fond of was the going back to the past, and present at first, but after a few episodes I got used to it. I also commend the writers for making Regina (The Evil Queen) the most hateful, and disliked character. However, as us viewers get deeper into her past, and realize why she became so heartless you start to feel sympathy for her. Who's to say that the Evil Queen can't change her ways, and go back to the light?",1478649600,,618,4.201680672268908

4602686,3,B0058YPL66,"This started off nicely. It is a great concept, and I really liked it for the first season. However...

It's written by the same people that wrote Lost. So you can't expect any real ""tie it all together"" plot. So if you get into it, keep in mind that sooner or later- that story line you've been invested in will be kicked to the old rubbish pile. The writers just go around without any direction other than ""how can we grab the audience THIS week!"".
So, of course, you lose too much story when you can see ""oh, there's this week's gimmick to reel me in"" and ""there's next season's gimmick"". And there are a lot of distractions. Like the characters will occasionally have shifts in their core personality traits for the sake of a gimmick. There's a constant introduction of new characters. There are story lines that never get tied up or followed up.
So you start off really invested, and then your investments turn into a series of fizzled out let-downs. That gets old after a while. So sometimes I think I'm bored of the show and other times I think that it just doesn't feel that great to watch the show. Either way I've stopped it on several occasions, realizing that I didn't pay any attention to whatever was happening for 15 minutes or so. It is a shame because this show made me a huge fan of Robert Carlyle, and I will be watching Barney Thompson because of this introduction.

If they ever did a Rumplestiltskin spin-off with different writers, I would be interested. And if they could add a couple characters that could hold their own on stage next to him and be just as memorable in how they are written and portrayed, then that would also be a big plus.",1478131200,,1666,4.4411764705882355

4602772,5,B0058YPL66,"There's a city in Maine called Storybrooke that's under a curse.  Why did the curse place the city in Maine?  Well, as we learn from Stephen King, Maine is the most vile place in the world I guess.  Or was it random?  Or the Enchanted Forest is located where Maine would be in their realm....

Sorry, that's me over thinking things

The inhabitants of Storybrooke forget that they once were different people.  From a different realm where only happy endings happen to heroes.  But in our world happy endings can happen to villains.  The Evil Queen from the Snow White tale casted this curse so she can win for once.

The first season is all about world-building and establishing characters which it does flawlessly without going down the grim and gritty path like police shows.

Emma Swan is the only hope for breaking the curse around Storybrooke and her son, Henry, brings her to the small hamlet of fairy tale characters.  Emma succeeds, of course, but not that easily

I discovered this series not on ABC but on Netflix.  I discovered it when the show was between the third and fourth seasons.....and I managed to complete watching it in time for the fourth season.  I was instantly hooked because it was so different from the dreck of other networks.

The show has superb storytelling bouncing from the modern day to the distant past when everyone was in the Enchanted Forest where most of the cast is from.

A great start to a great series",1471737600,,1445,4.625984251968504

4603166,5,B0058YPL66,"Season one is amazing.  Twist and turns, high tension, suspicion, and intrigue in a small town with literally ALL the secrets AND a strong element of epic fantasy.  It's quite an addictive show, but, with the latest seasons, I will say that there are very few moments that rival the avalanche on powerful moments and engrossing curiosity that the first season brings in full force.

The story is both simple and complex: the Evil Queen of Snow White fame has cast a curse that sends all of the inhabitants of their fairy tale world to a town in Maine where things just seem to have always been a certain way: time, in a manner of speaking, has stopped (think PG Stephen King setting without the exploration of small-town bigotries).  Before I go on, I should mention that the creators and writers rely STRONGLY on the premise that Disney versions of certain fairy tales are peerless interpretations and take a huge amount of liberty with the intellectual property that Disney has given them to play with.  The Disney-synergy element becomes far more transparent from the second season and doesn't let up, but the first season has some subtlety to it and proves to be a lot of fun.

The continue where I left off, our introduction to this story begins with a young boy from the town finding a seemingly random woman--who works as a bail bondsperson--who he believes is the key to breaking the Queen's curse.  When she (Emma, played by Jennifer Morrison [House]) returns the boy (Henry) to the town, Storybrooke, she finds that he is her biological son and that his adoptive mother is the Mayor of the town, Regina Mills, who also happens to be the Evil Queen.  Things don't feel right with Emma, especially where Regina is concerned, so she stays and things start to change in interesting ways.  The first season has the splendid novelty of trying to figure out ""who is who"" and ""who knows what.""  Henry knows all of this because of a magical storybook that chronicles everything that happened in The Enchanted Forest, which we get to see in the form of flashbacks, before the curse was cast.

Fair warning: The writers don't have a sense of foresight and throw a lot of things to the wall just to see what will stick.  Many times, they'll introduce a seemingly relevant plot point that won't be explained for seasons (and typically is shoe-horned in to provide damage control for their massive amount of retroactive continuity).  What's great about the first season is that there seems to at least be a element of creation concision.  What really saves the show is the approach that most of the actors tend to use: they take the major points seriously but are aware that some of the demands of the story may call for moments of levity to avoid being absurd, though camp elements do prove effective in this and many other seasons.  It is interesting to see how certain fairy tales are turned on their heads.

The two people to watch are Lana Parrilla and Robert Carlyle.  Parrilla plays Regina Mills (The Evil Queen), and no one takes their role more seriously than she does.  Of all the actors, she probably has the hardest job: running the gamut from playing a younger, more naive version of her queenly self to a regal dark sorceress to a quasi-sociopathic mayor to a very devout mother.  She gets some of the best lines, especially the larger portion of the delightfully sardonic dialogue.  Parrilla largely carries the show for the rest of its run: she continues to be an endearing part, if not the most endearing, of every episode in the current seasons.

Robert Carlyle, genius actor that he is, has almost as many roles to play with his character as Lana, but his most magnificent contribution to the show is when we get the privilege of seeing him as the deranged Rumplestiltskin (one of the most critical characters) in the fantasy realm.  This version of the impish character is far more imposing but also so unique in every way that he steals the show whenever he's on screen.  In the fantasy world, he's like a Mephistopheles-type deal maker with a warped mind that makes him delightfully droll, fantastical, clever, and in many ways terrifying.  His real-world curse form is that of the town loan shark and pawn broker Mr. Gold, who bears Carlyle's signature sparkling blend of charm and totally ominous menace.

Carlyle, like Parrilla, carries the show in this season and for the many seasons to come.  In this season, however [possible SPOILER ahead], both are more ostensibly evil than they may be in future and undeniably the ""big bads"" of the show, so enjoy that because both of them do evil so so well!

Despite an ending that seems very rushed, I still contend that this is the strongest of all the seasons.  The other major actors are given other chances to show what they can do, though it's almost always the ladies who shine (which is great).  Again, Carlyle's experience and professionalism (that he has literally brought to every project he's ever worked on [a truly brilliant actor who needs to be known by more]) and Parrilla's strength and dedication really make the show a delight.  Final warning: you will more than likely experience frustration with future seasons.",1459123200,,5197,4.729490022172949

4603169,5,B0058YPL66,"I came to this show late, but after getting the first season on DVD for Christmas, I love it. There's a great connection between the Enchanted Forest and our land, or Storybrooke. All the characters are complex, and even though the lines between hero and villain are pretty clear in this season, you still understand that neither camp is 100% good or bad. I also enjoy the fantasy elements, and the idea that many of my favorite fairytale characters could live and move in an expanded universe. In fact, some of these characters are better developed than they were in the original stories.

General Thoughts (Warning, Spoilers Ahead):

1. I love the update of Mary Margaret/Snow. Disney's Snow White was boring and a goody-goody. This Snow is strong, smart, and a total bad---.

2. The character arc with Regina is genius. Who would have guessed that the Evil Queen became dark because she lost her true love?

3. The relationship between Henry and Emma, while realistically strained at times, is one to root for. I'd want my son to be like Henry.

4. I was eager to see more of Belle and Rumplestiltskin/Gold after this season.

Overall, a gripping series that's staying on my keeper shelf!",1457740800,,1191,4.757281553398058

4603171,3,B0058YPL66,"I have been wanting to watch this series for a while so I finally got around to viewing it to see if it was worthy of the rave reviews. I'm a fan of Disney animated films so I am familiar with the stories and their origins.

The series is plays like soap opera, but with a fantasy element that makes it tolerable. It reminded me of Dark Shadows because it has a dream like tone. The actors are all adequate, but only the actor who plays Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) plays his part with any real emotion. The music is very repetitive and you'll find yourself knowing exactly what kind of scene is coming up with a redundant music cue.

The FX, well it is TV so I am more forgiving on this as the FX work with in the fantasy framework. My biggest gripe it the sloppy chapter breaks, When you want to skip the intro to the show sometimes their is a small scene that sets up the new episode that will be missed if you use the chapter skip. This is totally unacceptable, the only important chapter break is the fist one and they completely ruin it by skipping these small sections.

On the first four discs the only extra is a commentary, which is fine, but they include ""info"" as a bonus feature there too? Really? The FBI warning is a bonus feature? I am also disappointed that none of the TV aired specials for the show are included on any of the seasons.

One the plus side the show looks and sounds wonderful on Blu Ray, the menus are very nice with different touches to the menu for each episode  that  give a small referent to it. I like these little touches. I should point out that I dread most TV series as I feel they go on and on forever drawing stores out well beyond their interest factor.

If you like TV shows and you like Disney or fantasy programs, then this will probably be entertaining to you. It is also very female oriented with most lead characters being strong independent women so it is refreshing to see that. Sadly the best character by a mile is Rumpelstiltskin who is male.

The Prince Charming character is a buffoon and the weakest link in the series by far. I've watch the first and second season so far and it is growing a little tiresome, but I'm sure I'll make it through the rest of the series unless it goes really far off the rails.

Like I said earlier this is a soap opera with all the trappings, will that won't they?, who's you Daddy?, Who's your Mommy? The interest here is the unique take on very well known characters from famous fairy tales. The Blu Ray presentation is wonderful in a nicely made case with 5 disc on separate spindles, if not for the sloppy chapter breaks at the beginning of some episodes this would be a near perfect product of a good show. As it is, it's still worth viewing for fans of this kind of stuff, just be aware of the shipping option. It's very annoying to sit through the recap if you're watching multiple episodes in one sitting.",1457308800,,2907,4.319266055045872

I like how they make a new twist on old and modern fairy tales. I like their different perspective on the stories and the characters. They change our view on the typically ""evil"" characters by showing us their story and what made them the way they are. They were not always evil. Characters are complex, they do not remain on a single path, they evolve. And sometimes in a very unexpected way.

Emma then brings Henry back to his home in Storybrooke, Maine and meets his adoptive mother Regina Mills, mayor of Storybrooke. Noticing Regina's take-no-prisoners attitude, Emma remains in Storybrooke to keep a watchful eye over Henry, despite Regina's attempts to shut her out of Henry's life. Meanwhile, Henry is captivated by a book of fairy tales given to him by his school teacher Mary Margaret and claims that the residents of Storybrooke are really fairy tale characters in the book that have been transported to the real world and robbed of their memories of their past lives due to a curse placed upon the Enchanted Forest by the Evil Queen (Regina). Henry reveals to Emma that she is the savior of Storybrooke and she is the only one who can restore the memories of the Storybrooke residents and bring an end to Regina's reign.

Overall, Once Upon a Time is a show that absolutely no one should miss out on seeing. I have honestly never been so engaged in watching a show since Charmed. As for season one, it was amazing. The characters were expertly casted, the acting is great, the many twists and turns in the storyline kept me guessing every second, the magical effects are magnificent and there's plenty of shock value to go around.

When I did find the DVDs and decided to give it a shot, man it was like trying to eat one Lay's potato chip. Can't do it! My favorite character has been Rumplestilskin. The guy who plays him brings his evilness perfectly, even hislaugh is just right. The one thing that bothered me is his of the term of endearment of ""Dearie"" bothered
me when he was talking to guys, but having seen his later life and the woman in his life, I just scratched it
off as one of the characters quirks. Even though magic is used a lot here and some of the characters are
definitely evil, it is a series that you don't want to stop watching nor the series to end. I am glad that I am
watching the series the way I am, instead of watching it on T.V. And having to wait ah week for the next
episode. Watching it on DVD without commercials, one is amazed how fast the episode goes. I even stay
later than I should, cause I just want to keep watching it. Imay have to join OUAT Annonymus! ""Hello, I'm

Each episode was thought out, had a reason, the music, the costumes, everything had effort, thought put into it, and while i could not make a show myself, or possibly do better, it seems even those with money & training can only go so far before they fizzle out.

Now the plot goes everywhere as if making it up as they go along, (as opposed to an objective, long term plan being laid out before execution), there is no music only background noise, everything is set in the present time so no need for costumes, at least ones worth a da--, and last i saw a show of this, they were resorting to copying Disney. A shame considering that they started out defying Disney as far as antiquated ideas and plot (e.g ""the story you thought you knew really went like this...."" )

I was told these things happen because once the original writers get rich, they hand all the creative work over to worker bees with no imagination :(  Enjoy this season, its the only time when things were done right!",1439251200,2,1135,4.447115384615385

4603800,5,B0058YPL66,"Between Alias, 24, and Lost, for me the last decade was the decade of the highly serialized TV show.  All three of those were shows where you couldn't miss a second because something important would happen.  After starting a couple shows like that that fizzled, I was growing weary of that style of storytelling, instead looking for shows that were more episodic with just a hint of a thread that wove things together.

But some premises are too interesting to dismiss out of hand, so I gave Once Upon a Time a try.  I was hooked after the pilot, and the pull only got stronger as the season went along.  I couldn't wait for Sunday nights to find out just what would happen next to these great characters.

Our story opens in Boston as Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is celebrating her 28th birthday alone.  That all changes when Henry (Jared Gilmore) shows up on her doorstep and announces that he is the son she gave up for adoption.  He also spins a wild tale about Emma being the only one who can break a curse in his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine.  Emma's not buying it and takes him home.

But something happens when she meets Henry's adopted mother, cold, calculating mayor Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla).  Emma decides to stick around for a little while and see just what happens.  Along the way, she meets school teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Ginnifer Goodwin), amnesiac David Nolan (Josh Dallas), and pawn shop owner Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle).  Is Henry right?  Is Emma really the daughter of Snow White (aka Mary Margaret) returned to save the day?  If so, will she believe the truth in time to stop the curse?

The show is from creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis.  I have heard from several people that they ripped off a series of comic books for the premise.  Since I haven't read them, I don't know for sure.  To me, they are two of the writers of Lost, and that pedigree shows in how they tell their story.  Each episode features the latest developments in Storybrooke as well as flashbacks to the world of the Enchanted Forest where the lives of our characters before the curse unfolds before our eyes.

Of course, these flashbacks include some interesting twists to the familiar fairy tales we all know and love.  I'm not going to spoil any of them, but just be prepared for things to be much more complicated than you ever know.  This is especially true for Snow White and Prince Charming who overcome lots of obstacles before getting married, only to meet up with this curse.  But they aren't the only characters who show up since Henry is right - Storybrooke is filled with every fairy tale character you know, including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and Belle to name a few.

And in Storybrooke?  Well, the plot there unravels each week as Regina tries to drive Emma out of town, and Emma tries to figure out a way to outwit the mayor.  You might think they are fighting over Henry, and to some extent they are.  But since Regina is the Evil Queen, and the curse is because of her, Regina has another motive to get Emma out of town.

Now don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything for you.  Thanks to the flashbacks, I haven't revealed anything you won't find out without the first few episodes.  And the tapestry they weave their story through is so rich, you'll be drawn in yourself in no time flat.

The actors do a great job with the characters, which really helps make the story that much more exciting.  You care about the outcome because you care about the characters.  I have absolutely no complaints in the acting department, although I do think the character of Emma is rather stupid at times, but Jennifer Morrison makes her stupid actions almost believable.

But I must single out two of the actors for special praise.  Lana Parrilla absolutely shines as Regina.  She plays two faced so well when the situation calls for it.  And she seems to relish her role as pure evil when she gets to play that.  Likewise, Robert Carlyle is brilliant as Mr. Gold/Rumplestiltskin.  These are easily the two richest characters on the show, and the actors play them brilliantly.

The show does have one flaw, however.  Any time they try to use CG for the special effects, it is obvious.  Fortunately, that usually happens in Enchanted Forest, so the Storybrooke scenes are all believable.  And the effects never last for too long, so it's not a major issue.  As the season went along, the effects budget must have gotten bigger because they did seem to improve, although they still are not blockbuster movie quality.  Still, with a show this good driven by characters and story more than effects, it's worth noting mainly in passing.

Since the show airs on ABC, it is part of the Disney family.  The Disnerd in me loves the references, subtle and not so subtle, to the Disney versions of the tales here.  It's often small moments or a costume a character wears, but it is fun looking for these hidden Easter Egg moments.

Season one had 22 episodes, and they are all collected in this set in widescreen and full surround.  Extras on the set include behind the scenes featurettes that include interviews with cast and crew on why they love fairy tales, creating the character of Belle, and how they create the town of Storybrooke.  You also get several audio commentaries, and the standard bloopers and deleted scenes.  It is available in both DVD and Blu-Ray editions, and there is an exclusive extra on on the Blu-Ray on the historical origins of fairy tales.

If you've missed this wonderful show, now is the perfect time to catch it and catch up.  You'll be done with the first season of Once Upon a Time before you know it and ready for season two.",1433376000,,5681,4.610169491525424

It feels more like a really long movie than a collection of distinct episodes and by the time I reached episode 16 I was craving some resolution.

4603963,5,B0058YPL66,"Writers really know their fairy tales and do a great job of adapting and twisting them to suit the purposes of the show.  Main plot keeps you guessing, while subplots are fun to try to figure out (based on prior knowledge of fairy tales) before all is revealed.  Actors are fun to watch, and setting and costuming is lovely and not too high-tech, which only adds to the quirkiness and fun.  Entertainment for the intellectual and the not-so-intellectual alike!",1429574400,,460,4.7974683544303796

4603966,5,B0058YPL66,"From Season 1 and Beyond this is an AMAZING show. The writing is pure genius. The way they weave the characters and the connections of the characters to EACH OTHER so well, it is just...well genius. Anyone that is looking for gore, and bloody murders, and sex are not going to get that. I was well into Season 2 before I even realized how PG this show is. I was THAT enamored. And normally I love DARK fantasy (WGN's Salem, anyone?) and this is NOT dark. It is just wonderfully written, produced, directed and acted. It's just.... GOOD. I am a newcomer, only having started watching it when they were half way through season 3, and I saw a bit of that, and was instantly hooked. I went back and started from the beginning and have loved each and every second of it. It draws you in, and takes you on the most brilliant of rides. One minute you are in the present, the next in the past, back to the present, then suddenly back to a completely DIFFERENT place in the past, and even finding yourself in with a different character, and all in one episode. You would think following it would be difficult, but it is so well written, and it just all flows so well that you understand it all perfectly. I am a complete and total devotee of the show. If you are looking for something DARK this is not for you. If you are looking for true enchanting fantasy, THIS is your show. And as I said I love the DARK stuff (Again, I love Salem, I love Supernatural....etc.) but this is just so well written, acted and wonderful you can't help yourself. Give it a try, you will NOT be disappointed!",1429142400,,1579,4.31986531986532

4604378,5,B0058YPL66,"Once Upon a Time is set in Storybrook, a small fictional town near Boston. At first glance, Storybrook seems to be a typical town with ordinary people. However, as the show progresses, we discover the residents of Storybrook have been cursed by an evil queen to come to this world, live as a person, and forget about their past identities as fairytale characters. Like Lost, each episode focuses on a character by revealing his/her life in the past and in the present. What makes Once Upon a Time so enjoyable is that all the fairytale characters are connected to each other in the most unexpected ways and they may not be the characters we recognize from popular fairytales. In Once Upon a Time, nothing is impossible: heroes can turn out to be villains and vice versa.

In the opening scene of the show, we see Prince Charming (played by Josh Dallas) on his way to rescue his true love, Snow White (played by Ginnifer Goodwin) from her sleeping curse. He breaks the curse with true loves kiss, and they marry. This is the end of the fairytale we all know, but its just the beginning of Once Upon a Time.

White and Charming have a child named Emma. But in the moments before the Evil Queen casts a curse that causes all the people of the Enchanted Forest to transfer to a horrible world sans magic (ours), the couple manages to save Emma by sending her to our world apart from the other characters in hopes that she will one day break the curse. When White and Charming, known in our world as Mary Margaret and David, fall in love despite not remembering their real identities, we see the power of true love, which no curse can overpower.

Once Upon a Time presents the fairytale characters we grew up dreaming about and entertains us as adults with its powerful storyline and strong performances. With nearly every episode finishing with a huge cliffhanger (not to mention the mother of all cliffhangers in the season one finale), waiting for a new episode can be a pain. With so many unexpected plot twists and bombshells, the show never fails to play with your emotions.

Morrison is ok as the resident skeptic, but Goodwin and Carlyle really steal this show.
IMO, the weaker links are Dallas, who lacks charisma, and the actress who plays the queen, who is way too over the top.

NEVER do we see a blonde playing a native American in the village of Pocahontas (nor would I want to)! Politically correct is wrong if it must rewrite a people's historical folklore, and the cultural identity associated with that history. There is nothing ""evil"" in leaving them authentic and as is. If everyone is to love one another, the media has to stop sending the message that an all ""white"" (for lack of a better word) cast is somehow wrong.",1418601600,,620,4.697247706422019

4604722,5,B0058YPL66,"Once Upon A Time revolves around all our favorite Disney characters from our childhoods, but not the same stories that we were told. The creators of the television series have provided us with alternate back stories that are darker and more complex than what we were read to when we were children. Was Snow White really fair? Was the Evil Queen always evil? Did Cinderella really have a happily ever after? Rumpelstiltskin was a WHAT? All of these questions are answered as the series progresses, and there is a lot to take in and understand.

We start off being introduced to Emma Swan, a woman who had an awful past of being an orphan thinking that her parents didn't want her. Out of the blue, a birthday wish comes true as a boy shows up on her apartment door that happens to be her son Henry, of whom she gave up when he was a baby which basically repeated her parents' choice. Henry claims she is the savior of a little town in Maine called Storybrooke, a haven full of people that are unbeknownst to their real selves as the citizens of the Enchanted Forest, the magical land in which they came from that contains the same characters we've come to love as children.

Throughout the series, each episode gives us back stories on every single one, even the supporting characters like Jiminy Cricket, the Huntsman, the Mad Hatter, and many more. They are parallel to the stories we've been told mixed with a spice of the creators' histories that they gave to make them more three-dimensional.

Once Upon a Time is seriously a must watch television series that's packed with suspenseful turns, unexpected truths, and most of all: Magic.",1417824000,,1639,4.644827586206897

I've always been one to cheer on a villain who at the core is not so evil, so Regina and Rumplestiltskin were my favorite characters. Lana Parrilla and Robert Carlyle really brought these characters to life (Carlyle is especially entertaining as Rumple).

All in all, I am definitely continuing on with this series and will be purchasing Season 2 very soon.",1413504000,,630,4.616071428571429

One might have thought since one knows the tales that it would be predictable. This would be far from the truth. My husband hung in there for  at least half of it and when it proved too much for him he never strayed to far, coming back again and again to catch up on how the fairest of them all were fairing. Wonderful way to bring us all back to our youth, the magic and the lessons learned so long ago in those magical kingdoms of our imagination. I would watch more if there were more to watch.

Well thats not the case since all the fairytale people are under a curse to have normal nonmagic lives in Amercia and stuck in a town they cant leave. The fairytales are all messed up, and Rumplestilskin is part of almost all the stories, which makes no sense. Also the story characters are taken from Disney and Red Riding hoods is very similiar to the Red Riding Hood movie, except for a twist. Plus it also seems they got the idea from The Tenth Kingdom miniseries, and suggestive comments, plus adult problems/situations makes this not meant for young kids. Its ok, but seriously far from perfect and im actually not looking forward to season 2.",1411257600,,829,4.608108108108108

4605173,5,B0058YPL66,"I am almost always interested in fairy tale reinterpretations (especially for beauty and the Beast and anything involving mermaids), and this is probably the best one.  It ties all the tales we grew up with together while at the same time adding more depth to them than you could imagine.  Bottom line: This is a great show.  Unlike most of my reviews for TV shows, I'm not going to bother with grading every episode.  While some episodes were better than others, most were really good and they all served to further the story in some way.  I will list some of my favorite episodes.  The Pilot is a great start to the series; The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is a tear-jerker; The Price of Gold, That Still Small Voice, Skin Deep and Hat Trick are very interesting spins on the stories of Cinderella, Jiminy Cricket, Beauty & the Beast and the Mad Hatter, and the 2 part finale (An Apple Red As Blood and A Land Without Magic) was excellent and left me really wanting to see the next season (which I've already seen and it was even better).

4605347,5,B0058YPL66,Truly a great fantasy series based on children stories but played out for adult audiences (PG-13).,1404950400,,98,5.1875
4605348,5,B0058YPL66,"I remember seeing a behind the scenes preview for this in theaters back when Green Lantern came out and it didn't really leave much of an impression on me. What really got me interested was seeing that Frozen was going to be incorporated into the show and decided to check it out. I was surprised by how much I liked it, most of my favorite bits are the flashbacks to before the curse was enacted. I know that it's a mash-up of fairy tales in general but when they started saying the dwarves names and the Evil Queen said she was preparing to travel to the Forbidden Fortress, it's the Disney versions of these characters. For the record: no I've never read the original stories, really don't have a desire to do so (maybe one day). The Disney versions are what I grew up with (don't care if they altered them to have happier endings, though I do enjoy the darker stuff from what I've heard about them)

As far as acting goes, everybody's great, except Jared Gilmore, though he's not the worst child actor I've seen. A lot of credit to Lana Parrilla for really making the Evil Queen come to life (never cared for her all that much in Snow White), along with becoming one of my favorite villains, and making me hate what should be a despicable character for all the cruel things she's done, like framing Mary Margaret for murder. But then I felt sympathetic when her flashback story was revealed and I didn't want her to lose Henry to Emma in the real world since she is his mother. Then I wanted to slap the brat when he was revived since all he did was stare at her with a vacant expression after she told Henry she truly loved him (more on my feelings of the heroes in season 2). The writing for the most part is good but I'm still waiting to find out what happened to Cinderella's prince at the end of her episode (still wondering what's become of her character in general). I've never seen Lost so I don't hold whatever issues people had with the storylines on that show to what goes on here (though they do love recycling actors from that show). Special effects however, could be better. The two dragons and the magic effects look great along with how they do the green screen work for the fairies (the film version of Maleficent should've taken a cue from this show) but then I see laughable efforts like when the Huntsman shoots a terrible CG deer then pulls the arrow out of a real stuffed deer. Was it too hard to find stock footage of a real deer eating, looking up and running away? Didn't need to show the guy actually killing the animal.

If there's any complaint I have with the show it's a minor nitpick to probably a lot of people but pretty major to me and that is Maleficent, my favorite Disney villain (I'm talking about the animated version). She gets two scenes in two separate episodes and all I know of her in this universe is she traded her sleeping curse to Regina, she's gotten over the whole ordeal with Aurora and now has a black unicorn pony (I assume in place of her raven if the show goes by what happened in the movie). I want to know more! On top of that, she's dispatched by her friend pretty easily when she's purportedly the most powerful of all these characters (with the exception of Rumplestiltskin) but I'm going to say she was caught off guard by Regina when she attacked her little pony.

If you haven't seen the show yet, give it a try if you like fairy tales, particularly the Disney versions, and different twists done on said stories.",1404864000,,3480,4.392248062015504

You have the story begin by meeting Emma, who's birthday wish is to not be alone on her birthday, and her son Henry, who she gave up for adoption, comes knocking on her door with this intense excitement about the town he lives in, Storybrook. What happens throughout this season is a bunch of wonderful stories being told, from Snow White, to Cinderella, to Rumpelstiltskin, and you get to see their modern day counterparts.

This is a great show, perfect for the family, (little kids may be afraid, my three year old neice does not like when Rumple is on the screen).",1401667200,,795,4.371621621621622
4605508,3,B0058YPL66,"I'm surprised by the numerous five stars for this series which I thought barely earned the three I gave it. A part of my 3 star rating is a soft spot for anything fantastical or magical or giving strength to a decent female character. And the series definitely boasts some addictive qualities and is an easy-to-watch, mindless entertainment offering from ABC.

What's right about this show? Emma Swan played by Jennifer Morrison (was on House and more importantly played a small role having sex with Pacey on Dawson's Creek) is a fairly likable character who comes across as strong but avoids the b$#chy or whiny adjectives. She walks around in sexy tight pants and seems to care about a boy she only just met (her biological son) who appears to be delusional, socially inept and possibly annoying. Yet she remains in this ""Storybrooke"" town where mystery and magic are just below the surface of these boring, gray homes and characters. Storybrooke by the way is in Maine which is a great setting since no one really knows what's in Maine (even people who live nearby like myself). The only thing we know for sure is that Stephen King lives there which adds a certain element of the unknown.

It's easy to see at first why this show draws an audience. It has mystery and magic and retells fairy tales that we all feel a certain kinship towards. In addition we have a lost and lonely mother searching for her biological son and seems to find him right in time before the evil adopted mother totally does something awful, like make him do his homework in their grand palace of a home. Once Upon a Time creates two worlds, one the modern universe with Emma Swan in a leather jacket and lots of mascara and then another where the characters are in their fairy tale world with magic and sword fights. Due to a curse the fairy tale world has been transplanted to Maine where clocks barely move and people don't leave (sounds a lot like a typical small New England town). The show switches back and forth and gives watchers a way to imagine what these fairy tale characters would look like and do if they were in the modern world today.

Ultimately the show is an easy, entertaining 45 minute blur of magic and mystery and motherly loving. It's a show I've enjoyed while working out because I didn't have to use many brain cells to understand the plot. There are the elements of suspense and action all wrapped up in a very family oriented setting where for once we don't see lots of gore or heaving cleavage. So perhaps this show is popular because it took a few steps backwards in time allowing for wholesome, feel-good themes with old fashioned bad guys and true heroes. Finally there's a show out there in contemporary tv land that doesn't have us rooting for meth makers and serial killers. This is just old-fashioned good versus bad.

However then there's the bad and the reason this show didn't get more than three stars. The characters aside from perhaps Mr. Gold and Emma are all pretty awful. The character of Snow White is about as bland as her name. Not a single thing (including her not so cute pixie hair cut as Mary Margaret) gives us any reason to care or even like her. She and David (Prince Charming) have about as much chemistry as a turtle and an ant passing on a damp road under the moonlight. And yet we're dragged through their painfully unbelievable romantic woes as the show tries to create suspense around their destinies. Meanwhile I'm mostly just wishing Mr. Gold would curse her face so that she can never smile, cry or emote again.

So aside from some stupid acting choices for characters, the show also has some terrible special effects. I get that it's television but hasn't it been about 15 years since the Matrix happened?  Haven't all forms of visual media made huge strides and leaps towards a better world of monster looking monsters and believable action heroes? Once Upon a Time feelsl like I've gone back 20 years to Hercules and Xena where the monsters were so fake and silly looking that it could only be saved by attractive lead actors with rippling biceps or leather corsets.

Ultimately this show is the equivalent of a bathroom book (an easy read before you flush). It's entertaining and mildly addictive but things we sometimes want aren't always good for us. Aside from a few good characters, the rest are weak and the special effects appear to have been created by a fifth grade computer class. By the end of Season 1, I was pretty much done with it. However if you enjoy magic, mother/son reunions and a few screwy interpretations of fairy tales, then you may enjoy this!",1401321600,5,4614,4.612667478684531

also produced the excellent CASTLE series and WONDERLAND as well and do a great job with the latter two.  But I am  not a great
fan of the Disney conglomerate that own ABC because they have over the years turned away somewhat from the vision of the great
Walt Disney.  But here as well as in the other shows done a magnificent if a bit weird job of bringing Adult style fairy tales to life with
a darker, grimmer but more realistic form that I really love. Lately there has been a spat of darker versions of fairy tales by
independent companies such as NEVERLAND, ALICE and TIN MAN: all excellent.  But this season has  got it all. and a lot of stuff
to feast on.  A brilliant cast, I think, with a beautiful Snow White/Mary Margaret and Emma added to a very creepy Rumplestiltskin
who one can not figure is good, bad or just ugly.  A evil queen who is also very hot and just a bunch of wonderful others such as
the dwarves.  Wait until you see who shows up in season 3.  Anyhow Maine will never be the same.  Terrific special effects, dark
and gloomy forests, neat Castles and Palaces and sexy evil women.  The stories become more complex and if a person really
gets hooked on this show, one cannot miss any episodes because they all sort of tie together. And with all the flashbacks, if you
miss any you might get a bit confused though they do have at the beginning of each episode a brief update of what happened
previously.  I think they could speed up the stories a bit, but I am happy with what we have now.  The producers are going to be
adding more villians as the seasons roll on: I have watched the complete season 1 & 2 and get season 3 on my video library at
AMAZON.  I just ordered season 1 & 2 DVDs from AMAZON and will give my reviews of season 2 and 3 later.  And the best part
is NO Dr. Sweets!!  enjoy!",1395187200,,1953,4.179144385026738

4605818,5,B0058YPL66,"I am not a big ""TV watcher,"" but like most, I have my favorite shows that I try very hard not to miss. However, as these shows move from season to season the plots and characters become stale...same old, same old. Then in early October 10, 2013, something wonderful happened to make me want to watch at least one TV program, besides: CNN, ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Breaking Bad,"" ""Mad Men,"" etc. ""Once Upon a Time,"" a sort of  American fairy tale, premiered. I was hooked about a half hour into the pilot.

The show is based on the theory that there is an alternate universe where every classic fairy tale character existsa world that has a connection to our world.

In Storybrooke, a small town in Maine, beloved fairy tale characters we've known of since our parents read to us about them, are trapped in our world by a curse cast by an Evil Queen. Everything changes when a boy named Henry Mills, (beautifully played by Jared Gilmore), an adopted child, learns the ""truth"" through a ""special"" book. He finds out who his birth mother is and goes looking for her...heading toward Boston with his school teacher's credit card - desperate times call for desperate measures...right? Maybe not......

The action moves between the two worlds - one where the fairytale characters are themselves and living in their own parallel universe, and the present, in modern day Storybrooke, where they are trapped by their own curse-induced amnesia. The pilot seamlessly sets up the connections between these two worlds and makes it clear that the Storybrooke characters' stunted emotional lives could well be explained by the curse that Henry so fiercely believes in.

The  Pilot opens with a period Prince Charming, (Josh Dallas), racing into a snowy forest in search of Snow White, (Ginnifer Goodwin). He finds her in an open coffin, seemingly dead, and surrounded by seven rather gnarly looking dwarfs. But as in the timeless tale, his kiss awakens her and in the next scene they're being married. Suddenly, a sexy, snarly, Evil Queen, dressed in black-leather (Lana Parrilla - who is fantastically BAD), busts in to the celebration to inform everyone that ""I shall destroy your happiness, if it is the last thing I do."" What a GREAT Gift!!!!

Meanwhile, back in modern day Storybrooke, Emma Swan, (Jennifer Morrison), a bounty hunter and bails-bond collector from Boston, is on the track of a fleeing defendant. As she drives toward Storybrooke, searching for her ""missing person,"" she sees a boy walking alone, along the dark nighttime roadside. Dangerous! She stops the car and asks him where he is going and if she can help him. The boy is Henry Mills.

Emma had given a baby boy up for adoption 10 years before and now discovers that the infant is 10 year-old Henry. Although he has not yet reached the town's limits, he has traveled quite a distance. He is running away from home, looking for her....trying to find her because, as he tells Emma, ""No one can ever leave or enter Storybrooke."" This is Emma's 28th birthday and she wants, more than almost anything, to not spend it alone. As it were, she does get to spend at least part of it with her son. In any case, a disbelieving Emma drives the boy back home to the mother who raised him. So, Emma, innocent of her role in Storybrooke, enters the town, (probably the first person to do so), and into the story, as the prospective heroine.

As mentioned above, Henry has in his possession a special volume of fairy tales from long ago - certainly not your mother's book of fairy tales. The boy is convinced that Emma, his birth mother, is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. The royal couple sent her away so she would be protected from the deadly curse. They placed her in a magic wardrobe made from a block of wood by Mister Geppetto and his son Pinocchio. The infant was transported from the Enchanted Forest, within the fairy tale world, as a babe before she could be cursed. As such, she is the only person who can break the curse and restore the characters' lost memories.

The town is indeed populated by fairy-tale characters such as the above mentioned Snow White and Prince Charming, only they have no idea of their true identities. The only two who do know are the Evil Queen, a.k.a. Regina Mills who is also the town's powerful mayor and Henry's adoptive mother, and the villainous Rumplestiltskin, (Robert Carlyle). a.k.a.  Mr. Gold, the enigmatic owner of the local pawn shop, as well as the town itself. Jiminy Cricket, Geppetto, Pinocchio, Captain Hook, Red Riding Hood, the Seven Dwarves, Hansel and Gretel, Belle and the Beast, etc., are all characters in both worlds.

I love the concept of the program, but then I always loved fairy tales.  And, even this late in my life, I do believe there are at least a few happy endings. ""Once Upon A Time"" is very different from what what's on television at the moment, (""Grimm"" cannot even begin to compare with the quality and talent of OYAT). The cast does a fantastic job! And the clothing, scenery and decorations in fantasy land are sumptuous. I can not wait to continue watching the show and see how the storyline develops in Season 2. Very highly recommended!

4605877,1,B0058YPL66,"Once upon whose time? Here is the perfect example of a series with an intriguing premise, boding well of a story arc to come, possibly comprising many intelligently intertwined sub-arcs
Alas! If the first couple of eps could keep expectations up, especially through some good acting of just a couple of characters (Robert Carlisle: wow!), that was it. Gradually it all watered down, thinned to virtually nothing but irrelevant anecdotes and forgettable secondary characters. The thrown in intrigue about who ""did something"" to David's wife and the accusation of Snowhite are so ridiculous that they kill suspense instead of keeping it going. The major problem, though, is the lack of objective, the lack of destination: where does this all lead to? It is scrambled, hastily scrambled, with some poor writing, some bad acting (Regina e.g.: only strong bad looks) and an irritating take on the Grimm (and others') fairy tales. Red riding hood: a werewolf? You must be joking! Snow's father (king) killed by the genie from the lamp? Ha! Prince James Charming (not a real prince, even) destined to marry king Midas' daughter? I must be dreaming, pinch me!

Mr. Gold and Regina are great as the villains.

I have my favorite shows and rarely go beyond the ""A"" list of my personal programming. This show was brought to my attention by a couple of different family members. I liked it immediately and bought the season. I am not disappointed. While the stories are somewhat more primitive than Americans are accustomed, the moral of the story tends to be kept intact. There is some violence that may not be appropriate for young viewers, and the dialog is likely to be over the head of many under the age of 20. Still, all in all, it is good and strong and appropriate for young adults even though they may not understand the finer points of the show.

One perhaps unintended consequence of the show is that I view the fables with a eye toward the evil queen in many stories being the same person that Brothers Grimm originally wrote about.

Overall,  I enjoy the series immensely but occasionally I find the stories either wildly fantastic (fun) or maundering (dull), extremes without a middle ground (mixture of both).  Granted, the maundering ones are often to introduce or flesh out characters.  I love the settings and the acting is excellent, especially Mr. Carlyle as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin).  The dark twist in old familiar characters is highly entertaining.  Some characters, like Rumpelstiltskin, have far greater depth and many facets not previously revealed in the stories I read decades ago.  It's a enjoyable way to escape reality on a Sunday night.",1388448000,,657,5.372549019607843

4606043,4,B0058YPL66,"It's done by the guys who did Lost (Kitsis and Horowitz). You can see their style unravel through the show and know right then. But the show is original enough to be enjoyable. In short, imagine all of the fairy tale characters you have grown up with from stories and see them somehow make it to the real world. Now, before you say anything...yes, there is a comic/graphic novel series called Fables that has a similar concept, but its darker and grittier in its own ways. This one is an ABC production, approved for viewing by audiences that can get it, and it is an enjoyable one.

The show is a bit of a slow starter for a couple of episodes, but each and every character slowly gets highlighted with their backstory and little tidbits behind their history unfolding throughout the course of the series. Overall, this show is a rarity that should be experienced at least once. Hey, they are in the midst of the third season, so you know it's doing something right.",1388448000,,967,4.525714285714286

I saw an episode of the third season a few months ago and I liked it but I didn't understand jack ALSO I starting watching Once Upon A Time: In Wonderland and I loved it, but didn't QUITE understand the Knave and that whole beginning part it was so odd. So I HAD to see the first season. I am not done. I will probably be done next year hopefully I am half there. I love it. It is fantastic. It is not ""traditional"" Disney and it shouldn't be. It is not traditional anything though not even the original stories. That's fine. It is its own thing. I like that. So I will watch it and I am sure it will continue to be good and I will be able to understand the current season which I have decided not to look at for now. I've seen enough to understand the Wonderland series which is its own thing as well. One thing... it started okay but kind of slow and I am not into the Lost Easter Eggs. That sort of thing is annoying to me. I wish these people would just do a show without having to reference to others shows. I LOVE the hints at the credit or titles and I love the fairyland clothes.",1386892800,,1181,4.029787234042553
4606146,5,B0058YPL66,"I will only write the basic review. I don't like when other write everything that happens then its no fun to watch. I thought the show was about Snow White and Prince Charming and the witch. Well it has all of the fairy tale characters. Red Riding Hood, Rumpelstiltskin, Robin Hood, Pinocchio etc. It tells the story a curse the witch places on all the fairy tale characters and sends them to Storybrooke. Here is where they are with no memory of their other life. A woman is contacted by her son who she gave up and the boy tries to convince her who she is and how all these characters can get their memory back with only her help. It is well worth watching. I really love how they are going strong with season 3. The characters they keep introducing: Mulan, Sleeping Beauty, Captain Hook and Peter Pan etc. It is really fun to have a new twist on the ole characters",1386892800,,867,4.325153374233129

I especially loved the first season because it felt like a really long movie. The costumes, imagery, acting, the characters, and the script are all very engaging. I have a lot of fun guessing who all the fairy tale characters are (and am often surprised). I love seeing all of the classic fairy tale characters struggling in real life. Each episode focuses on a particular character's backstory, which deepens what I already know about these characters from my childhood. At first, I thought Once Upon a Time seemed lame, but I'm glad I gave it a chance because it turned out to be a really awesome show.

I just got this directly from Amazon.  The outer slipcase was damaged--clearly worn from handling, etc.  What amazed me, however, was the Wal-Mart price sticker on the slipcase!  Seriously.  How on earth did this happen.  There is shinkwrap around the clamshell that appears to be the original shrinkwrap, but I don't trust it at all.  This is going back to Amazon.  Is this someone's idea of a joke?  I've ordered several thousand dollars worth of stuff from Amazon over the past few years, and never had a problem.

Here's why: the premise is so intriguing, you have to give it a try.
The story line is so conviluted, I don't have the patients to sit and watch beyond the first season. It's stupid. It's confusing. The acting is terrible. Ginnifer Goodwin was beyond fantastic in HBO's Big Love. Here, however, she plays snow white, but has ugly short hair, and a daughter than looks the same age. The liberties they took with the traditional stories ruin everything. Belle is Austrailian, for example. Why the heck would you make a romantic french maiden Australian?? Nothing against the actress who plays Belle though... she's great, especially in LOST.",1385251200,,741,4.66412213740458

Maybe because I am a retired Senior, and read a great deal as a child and throughout the rest of my life, I am very familiar with all the Fairy Tales and loved the ""and they lived happily every after"" endings.

This series takes away those endings and brings you into the present day, but with your favorite Fairy Tale characters as residents in a small town.  It's fun to guess who is who as the storyline goes back and forth to the Fairy Tale time to now.

It's an incredible journey.  You can ""stream"" the pilot for a very small cost just to see what and how all this is accomplished.

episodes, but im really looking for better conclusions without the message that the evil queen knows all....its
getting repetitive. When will Emma wake up...come on ..she is getting hints and proof but still has a hard time
believing...why doesn't she bring a few characters past the town 's border etc.etc.etc.

I find it interesting to think about what their motivations are for the people they've become. It's interesting to see them all interacting with each other, as well. Sometimes, the story and/or graphics can be a bit cheesy, but if you put those things aside and just watch the show for fun, it's quite enjoyable. I'd recommend watching this show from the beginning.",1376438400,3,483,4.761904761904762

4606444,4,B0058YPL66,"We've only just finished the first season.  It's a great show.  Not as good as ""Breaking Bad, ""Justified"" or ""Sopranos"" so I can't give it 5 stars, but a solid 4 for sure.

I didn't read fairytales growing up so my wife has to be my technical advisor while we watch it.  Haha, not kidding.  It's funny when I have to pause it to ask, ""Now who did Red Riding Hood fight with; is it the same wolf that was after Goldie and the Pigs"".  lol  She gets a kick out of me more than the show I think.

Anyhow, I really enjoy it.  She loves it.  I do get a little annoyed at how slow or how ""family-friendly"" it can be at times.  But that's to be expected.  It is based upon the fairytales of your childhood - well most people's childhood anyway.  And it does have to create a series so me feeling it's moving slowly is just my lack of patience for the Queen to............  Ooooops, almost a spoiler.  Sorry, but you'll have to watch it.

I like it.  I like how one world's story is told ""moving forward"" while the other's is told usually ""moving backwards"".  I like Rumple. An amazing character.  Kinda cool too how the main character (not the Queen) is only in one world.  All the other actors have to play at least 2 characters.  That's really cool to watch.

Buy it, rent it.  You'll like it.  And if you actually know the childhood fairytales, you'll probably love it....deary.  ;-)",1376006400,3,1378,4.2684824902723735

4606491,4,B0058YPL66,"Honestly, I wasn't all that enthusiastic about `Once Upon a Time'. I saw the teaser on tv and wasn't particularly impressed. Sounded like a stupid idea. But then a friend of mine convinced me to see at least the pilot of the series... and I was hooked.

What I like the most about this series (at least this first season) is the way well known fairy tales had been rewritten so to come all together and create one larger story. Yes, there are some logic slips here and there, but on the whole, the story stays together nicely and every character add something to the larger picture.
I also enjoyed the way the story was structure, basically starting from the ending and going backwards. That was probably the cleverest idea, in my opinion, because that was what kept me returning to this series and wanting to see more. I knew most of the fairy tales used in here, and I was eager to see how they had been used. And what's more, every piece falls in its plaice but not in a chronological manner. Pieces of stories are provided at random, so that the viewer has to figure out where in the chronology every piece of information goes. It requires participation from the viewer and I enjoyed this a lot.

The main characters are mostly fine. What I heard said from other fans of the show is true for me too: my favourite characters are the bad guys, Regina and Gold. The two actors are very good in the part, and their characters provide for maybe the best new take of the story. But I liked Snow White as well. Her character is far from the damsel in distress of the fairy tale. She's a strong-willed woman and I like the way her story had been intertwined with Regina's so that the hate between them is believable and never rests on stupid misunderstandings. It's the course of life that put them one against the other in spite of their best intents.

My only complaint would be that the story in the fairy tales' world is far more interesting than the one in the `real' world, so that characters in the real world tended to be less interesting. This is particularly true for the two that should be more important: Emma and Henry.
Henry seems to be there only as an excuse. It is never clear why he believed in the book he was given and how he came to the conclusion that the stories in the book are real fairy tales and they're connected to the place he lives in and the people around him. That's a very weak part of the plot, in my opinion. Emma... you never know what's she's thinking. I was never sure whether she believed Henry or not, and if she didn't, why she acted like she did. Maybe if the stories in the fairy tales' world and the stories in the real world had been more connected (I mean, more than just by the characters), the characters' motivations would have been stronger. Maybe.
But all in all the show was so enjoyable that I'm more than willing to forgive weaknesses and non-logic things that are in there.

4606680,5,B0058YPL66,"The residents of STORYBROOKE, MAINE are living in a dream world totally unaware they are actually fairy tale characters cursed to live in the ""real"" world. A simple premise that provides a remarkable journey into mesmerizing storytelling and a complete visual explosion of color and detail. ONCE UPON A TIME is a totally fresh take on beloved fairy tales. The writers revel in telling a completely new version of these beloved tales and they create a visual feast for viewers who'll find they can't get enough of this inventive series.

Troubled Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is about to enter a new realm of reality when the son she gave up for adoption 10 years ago suddenly appears to appeal for her help. Jared Gilmore is a pure treasure as precocious Henry Mills. Thanks to the magic of a fairy tale book, 10-year-old Henry knows the true story of the residents of Storybrooke. He knows that only an unbelieving Emma can break the curse and return the residents to their enchanted fairy tale lives. Gilmore is just a pure delight as young Henry.

ONCE UPON A TIME is delightfully fresh in its creative retelling of beloved fairy tales. Here we get the back story of Snow White and her Prince Charming, Little Red Riding Hood, The Evil Queen, Rumplestiltskin and so many more characters. The writers have a free reign to create stories from their imaginations. What evil let Jiminy to become a cricket and eventually have a conscience? What is the real reason the Evil Queen hated Snow White? In this version, ""the fairest of them all"" has been replaced with a far darker reason.

This truly lavish production  seems to relish its desire for detail in costume, setting and character.
ONCE UPON A TIME seems to be a collision of ABC's hit series LOST and HBO's GAME OF THRONES. The show jumps back and forth between the present and past as we learn each character's back story and the fairy tale times are reminiscent of medieval days. Even LOST's Emilie de Ravin is one of the stars is as the beautiful and endearing Belle who can see a person's inner beauty.

A perfect cast was assembled to create characters in their fairy tale lands and in ""reality."" Lana Parrilla is strikingly delicious and gorgeous in her roles at Storybrooke mayor Regina Mills and as the original Evil Queen.
Her sultry evil is framed by a beauty so overwelming that any fairy tale or real man would collapse at her feet with desire. Ginnifer Goodwin as Storybrooke's Mary Margaret is a more sedate and a much less ""fairest of them all"" version of Snow White. Snow has a story and it is not always pretty. Topping off the cast is Robert Carlyle as the evil Rumplestiltskin and town miscreant Mr. Gold. Here is a one of a kind cast that simply fills the screen with their savory interpretations of their fairy tale and reality versions.

Another person of note is Josh Dallas as David Nolan and Prince Charming. His love of Snow White (Mary Margaret)overcomes the barriers of time and location yet their star-crossed love is constantly undermined by cirumstances beyond their control. Dallas is perfect as Charming with a great sense of humanity and humility. His facial expressions convey a charm that is unequaled and this Prince Charming does not shy away from shedding a few tears when needed.

Having sung the praises of ONCE UPON A TIME, there are flaws. New characters are constantly being introduced--talk about a cast of thousands. Each new character has his or her own back story and the stories are interwoven with other character--though, in the original fairy tales, the characters are separated by their own stories. It can be exhausting to keep track of everyone and who is good and who is bad.

Halfway through the season, the show loses steam with an annoying plot in which one our the main characters is accused of murder and arrested. The plot drags on in its silliness and its clear that Storybrooke has an inept judicial system. Hey, this seemingly large town has ONE sheriff and no police force. It's just another chance for Lana and Mr. Gold to continue their fairy tale fight into the real world.

Lovely Jennifer Morrison is under-utilized throughout much of the season looking positively dowdy hidden under a large women cap. She is growing closer to Henry as her fight with Regina intensifies. Only in the season finale do we see what a talented actress Morrison is when finally given the chance. Season two will certainly reveal more.

Here is a show that has pizzaz. It's so rare to see a production where all the pieces fall into place. It's clear that the actors are having a great time and the writers are loving the chance to recreate fairy tales. Add in costume designers, set decorators, and an all-around perfect crew and you find the magic--the magic of ONCE UPON A TIME.",1367366400,,4787,4.729016786570743

4606683,5,B0058YPL66,I love both seasons 1 and 2. I would recommend watching it. It may not be suitable for the young ones more of a teen/adult show.,1366588800,,128,3.9615384615384617

4606685,5,B0058YPL66,"When I first heard about this series, I thought it sounded hokey. Then the first season became available on Netflix, so I decided to watch the pilot just for fun because some girls at work had been raving about it. I was hooked in the first five minutes. This series is fantastically written, nicely acted, and the interwoven and continuing storylines are addicting. I really must return to my life, but I must watch this!",1366502400,,422,4.64
4606696,5,B0058YPL66,"Not having seen this on TV a friend thought I may like it. He was right. Sure the first episode grabs you and the next few are really about character development but after episode five or six things start to take off. It's a bit like the Twilight Zone in that each episode is unique, locations are different and most of the characters change with the exception of the three leads. Well worth a look and I am enjoying it.",1366502400,,420,4.2625
4606697,5,B0058YPL66,"I received this DVD in a gift basket I won from a local TV station.  It took a while to watch it because I honestly didn't think it would be that good.  Was I wrong?  Oh, yeah!

My son (14 years old) was even more reluctant to watch than I was.  ""Fairy tales?  Really, Mom?"".  And he barely glanced at the first couple of episodes.  But as time went by, he became as fully immersed as I.

This is an incredible show.  The only actor I initially recognized was Robert Carlyle and since he has never failed to deliver, I had hope.  He didn't disappoint and neither did the rest of the cast.  You can't help but love some and hate some and regardless you are going to love the whole show.  It is not at all predictable and you never know which way they're going to jump.

When it ended I thought that would be it.  What can they do now?  Well, I don't really know, but I can't wait for season 2 to come out so I can find out.

I doubt you'll be disappointed in this.  We sure weren't.",1366416000,,981,4.020833333333333

Well, for me if a show doesn't ""get"" me by the first few episodes its not a good sign (if it gets me by the first- well it's LOVE). And by the 5th disc it was like ""do we really have to watch another"". God knows we have a row of other box sets to watch that we have more interest in. Don't get me wrong, the concept I like, I like some of the characters, but I can't get into the main character as the heroine. She is way to casual about it...and as Forrest Gump would say ""And that's all I have to say about that""...",1366329600,2,649,3.710144927536232

It was a brilliant idea.  We set up at night and share quality time together watching the season one shows.  They are all there, the product is great, it arrived in a sealed container, no scratches or damages of any kind.  We love it and thank you for your prompt response, and great merchandise.

Now I am ready for the Season Two shows!

4606726,5,B0058YPL66,I saw the commercials long time ago and figured I would just rent the seasons later. After the pilot I was hooked!! Love how it incorperates the fairy tale and reality crossover so well!! These writers or so creative. I enjoy trying to figure out who is who in the fairytale and how the story plays out. So far in one night I managed to watch 4 episodes and can't wait to finish this season to start the next. Hey at least I don't have to wait one week apart or hassle with commercial breaks!!,1365033600,2,493,4.2
4606727,5,B0058YPL66,I remember watching Once Upon a Time and Grimm last year. And when I saw the pilots for both shows I realized Once Upon a Time was my fairytale show. I love how the writers twist certain things around. And I also love that this is a fantasy show thats not about vampires. The first season is about the Evil Queens curse and how it ripped our favorite characters away from the Enchanted forest into our world and they don't remember who they are. Now its up to Emma the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming to break the curse. It was hard to pick a favorite episode. I definitly love how we see Snow White and Prince Charming meet for the first time in Snow Falls. There might have been 2 episodes I didn't care for and that was The Price of Gold and Skin Deep. I didn't like that Rumplestiltskin was mixed in with Cinderella and was the Beast in Beauty and the Beast. I thought it was a little too out there. I don't count Rumplestiltskin and Belle as Beauty and the Beast I just count it as Rumple having a love intrest. But regardless of Rumbelle I still love the show anyway. And if I could give this show a grade it would be an A-. If you love fantasy shows give Once Upon a Time a chance. My grandfather didn't think he'd like it but I got him hooked to this show since last year. My moms side of the family are huge Oncer and a few of my friends are huge Oncer fans like I am.,1365033600,,1388,4.087912087912088
4606728,4,B0058YPL66,"I really enjoyed this series due to the superb acting.  And the complexity of the characters makes them more believable.  I have rarely seen a combo of good and evil characters where all were performed so well and there were so many complex relationships among them.  Rumpelstiltskin is my favorite - he is actually repulsive and appealing almost simultaneously - a very skillful portrayal. I was a little disappointed in a plot turn of last season 1 episode - I won't give it away - but other than that, found it hard to not keep going to the next episode.",1364947200,,557,4.55

4606766,5,B0058YPL66,"I just started watching this show last week. I didn't catch it on TV, because I had just had a baby and wasn't able to focus on a lot at once (due to no sleep, other parents I'm sure you can relate!!!). I decided to watch it, because I keep hearing so much positive feedback from it. I am at a loss for words...but WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO WATCH THIS SHOW?!

I must admit, I'm a fan girl when it comes to fairy tales, Princesses ( I was going to be one..of course...lol)and far away lands. This show has all of that and SO. MUCH. MORE. Seriously, you think that you know your fairy tales, well, you're wrong. Not only does this show bring in all your favorites, but gives you back stories on how everything came to be. Why would the Queen hate Snow White so much that she throws all of the fairy tale characters to our world and to have everything they loved ripped away from them? Will they ever be able to go home or get stop the curse?

This is one of the best TV shows that I've seen in a long time. I would recommend it, if you haven't watched it yet. Besides, what are you waiting for?",1364169600,,1092,4.027649769585254

However, in watching it on the TV, due to the many scene changes and time jumps cut by commercials, it is often hard to follow what is happening. With the DVD, without all the commercial breaks, it is a lot easier to see how the story plays out.
Season one really introduces you to the various characters and sets the basis for the plot line. Watching it again on DVD, I often felt like I was watching a new story as I finally got to see how all the changes fit together.

This particular series is highly addicting and very entertaining. It's a cross between a fairy tale world and reality. It's kind of crazy and amazing how talented the world's intertwine.

I found this series to be highly entertaining and enjoyable to watch without too many adult things that keep my kids from being able to watch as well.

It's not as predictable as it would appear. These aren't the fairy tales you grew up on as a child. They're all altered slightly and unexpectedly.",1363564800,,623,4.7592592592592595

This was the only place to get it on Blu-Ray, we can get Glee on Blu-Ray in the UK but not this. It was estimated to arrive 4 days before it did. This wasn't too bad except for the delivery method chosen. I had previously ordered Glee on Blu-Ray from them and I had had no problems with this. Just this end DHL chose Yodel, I'm not sure how the two are related, and Yodel are fraught with problems and this is the first time I've ever dealt with them. I did eventually get it a week and a half later, and settled down to watch it. I like the addition of trailers, some of the shows I had never heard of. Then on to the main menu, a couple of times I had problems with the menu but maybe it's my Blu-Ray player. I prefer the Seasonplay on Glee, because I had to go through the language setting menu, then the intro, until I could click 'menu'. I'm only half way through and haven't made it to any special features, I wanted to watch the show so don't tend to bother with audio commentaries. It's nicely packaged. I like the lenticular cover, though it does just look like someone stuck it on with a bit of glue, and it's squify but that's me being a perfectionist. The video is great, the audio is great, it's a great difference from watching it off regular SD TV. Given the ending I do wonder about Season 2 though, but that will shortly be shown over here. If you're into happy endings, don't mind a bit of violence (though it's gently done) then this show could be the one for you. If you're still undecided, read another review but if you're not from the UK then I guess the delivery might not bug you.",1362528000,,1692,4.161585365853658

Very entertaining and well done. I can't wait for the second season to complete so I can do the same thing.

I liked Robert Carlyle as the 'sort of' villain in Stargate Universe, and thought the role they gave him here was even better suited to his acting talents.

Its obvious to see ties to the writers from Lost in this new series, especially in the titles for each episode. Let's hope they don't screw this one up with a dud of an ending - or a premature ending to the series because of potentially bad writing down the road.

Each episode has a self-contained plot with a beginning, middle and end, but all tie together into an over-arching story which culminates in the season finale in a very satisfying way.  Before the show first began, I thought it would just be a rip-off of ""Fables"" by Bill Willingham (also worth checking out, by the by), but that fear proved unfounded.

Towards the end, I invited my 16 year old to sit and watch with me one afternoon when he was bored.  He said OK, but was texting on his phone as he sat down.  I peeked over and found him watching the show, then becoming thoroughly entranced.  I gave him the backstory over dinner that night and he was asking questions about who the characters were, the stories, how they interacted, etc.  Of course, never in a million years would he tell his friends he likes or watches it.  After finished on Netflix, I had to stream from Amazon the Season 2 premiere (had to find out!!!) and watch on the PC.  DS came back to the office to watch with me, so I knew he was a goner, too!  It's not often I can find things we are both interested in!  Thanks Once Upon a Time!  I love the beautiful characters, great sexy costumes and makeup!

I live in Rwanda, East Africa, and am always looking for a good show to hold my attention, and just get lost in from time to time. This show has been excellent. Even the girls who live with me who are Rwandese love it, despite the language barrior. It has enough action to even hold your attention when it is not your language. I look forward to getting the second season! (When it is available, and the 1-2 month wait for it to actually arrive here! Totally worth it though!)",1360627200,,539,4.242718446601942

4607003,5,B0058YPL66,"More than we expected. My 15-year old son and I look forward to each episode as it airs. We love this show because of its innocense, an all-too-rare quality in today's television and movie world. I don't have to preview episodes before our children watch the show. I don't cringe while watching it because there's nothing terrible in it. There were a couple of episodes with some remotely suggestive behaviors that very young children wouldn't pick up on - nothing blatant. My son's only problem with it is that some of the Enchanted Forest costumes show too much cleavage. (He believes that such things are meant only to be shared between husband and wife, and he points that out every time he disapproves of someone's costume.) Very little foul language (I could probably count on one hand the number of four-letter words dropped in the first season), excellent moral lessons, and a very well thought out story line. With every episode, the writers put unexpected twists into beloved fairy tales, which often solicit squeals of delight or shocked gasps from viewers. Such a PLEASANT and refreshing change of pace from typical TV drama. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this show, and the DVD has some awesome extras - bloopers, deleted scenes, making of, etc. My son and I both give it two thumbs way up. We recommend this to anyone looking for a good family series to watch.",1360368000,,1361,4.771186440677966

The Rumplestilskin character is good on here. and everybody is very well-acted. the evil queen is geat, Ginnifer Goodwin is gret, her daughter is great. the costumes and acting and quality are all great. It is just kind of boring. It makes me fall asleep and I really don't care about the plot and the characters, though i want to.

Such a nice change - very refreshing - from the usual shows on television.  For me, personally, it is one of those rare shows where I can get totally absorbed (and forget about the rest of the world) and want to see more. I won't say it will do that for everyone, however.

I had watched a show mid-season and thought it was ""okay"" - but my son insisted that I watch from the pilot all the way through the first season. What a difference!  Clever writing, to get all of these characters intertwined in a cohesive storyline. And the costumes are incredible!!  I'd watch this show just to see the costumes.  The person who makes them is a genius -- wish I could find a place to buy one for a costume party (which I would throw JUST to wear the costume).  Can't wait until Season Two is out.",1359936000,,614,4.213675213675214

I am very glad I gave this show a try. It is 'childish' is a grownup way. The show is very well done. The characters are complex and the storyline is presented in a way that totally pulls you into the fantasy. Sometimes I hate dual storylines but this show totally pulls it off. The cinematography in StoryBook land is fantastic. The villainess is beautiful, wicked and has some amazing dresses. I hope to see more storybook characters in future episodes.

If you like fantasy type stuff, give this one a try. I am so glad I did. Season 1 and ABC both definitely gets 5 stars for this series.",1359504000,,711,4.378787878787879

4607094,5,B0058YPL66,"ABC's popular series Once Upon a Time depicts the challenges faced by beloved fairytale characters when a curse transports them to a wretched and cruel land without magic, modern America. Without memory of their former selves, the characters of Storybrooke, Maine, are trapped in modern lives and tangled with issues like adultery, crime, and murder.

Thanks to an aged book given to him by his teacher Mary Margaret, formerly known as Snow White, a young boy named Henry begins to understand the town's dark curse, and with little success, tries to educate the citizens of their true identities. Henry must convince an entire town of their forgotten past and track down the savior who will break the curse, all while living under the roof of the evil queen, his adopted mother, Regina.

Once Upon a Time began in October of 2011 and received a promising response. The pilot episode pulled in 13 million viewers with a 4.0 rating for viewers between 18 and 49. Since its first season, the show has jumped from number 28 to number 19 in television rankings. In 2012 Once Upon a Time was also nominated for ""Favorite New TV Drama"" at the People's Choice Awards and Teen Choice Awards while receiving two awards, ""Best New TV Drama"" and ""Best Villain"", from TV Guide.

Since the show is produced by the Disney-owned ABC network, the show uses Disney trademark names like Pongo and Jiminy Cricket in addition to classic characters like Cinderella and Prince Charming. These characters interact outside the confines of their original tales, which result in compelling and intricate relationships that evolve with each episode.

Perhaps the most fascinating feature of OUAT is observing how timeless characters respond to the challenges of modern life without the help of magic. The lack of magic comprises the central theme as the appeal of the show lies entirely in possibility: the hope that magic, goodwill, and happy endings do exist outside the pages of a far-forgotten kingdom. The series casts traditional values of chivalry, honor, and love in a current light that instills the audience with a sense of optimism and faith, if only for sixty minutes.

The show does, however, lack backstory and romantic appeal for Emma Swan, the savior. Perhaps with the introduction of Henry's father, audiences could see a spark rekindled in the near future. Also, now that all the characters are trapped in Storybrooke, the show often focuses on the present day, neglecting the traditional fairytale scenes and subplots viewers have found so captivating. Should the switch to modern times span more than a few episodes, compensation with time in the forgotten kingdom will surely be demanded by avid viewers in upcoming seasons.

Lovers of Disney, the television series Grimm, and fairytales of all sorts are sure to love Once Upon a Time as it offers a modern approach to well-known stories, making the familiar unfamiliar in a most intriguing way. The show hinges on computer graphics, fictional lands, and magical weaponry, so fans of science fiction may also find this show particularly appealing. Last, but certainly not least, Once Upon a Time calls to all optimists, romantics, in-the-closet knights, and believers of magic.",1359072000,4,3220,5.0546139359698685
4607095,5,B0058YPL66,"this is one of the best shows on tv right now.... if you have not seen it yet... you are truly missing out.... so get on it and check it out... oh and LANA PARRILLA IS AN AMAZING EVIL QUEEN!!!!!! TRULY THE BEST....... so happy with the casting and the show in general, but they could not have chosen a better a  actress for the evil queen... Lana Simply put is FANTASTIC!!!!",1358985600,,374,4.194444444444445
4607096,4,B0058YPL66,"Now, I have only watched 2 episodes on Netflix so far and it is not too bad.  Good idea... interesting enough....  The acting at times is a bit over the top and not necessarily intentionally funny yet my husband and I have chuckled at some of the characters in their attempt to be dire and serious especially in the alternate fairy tale world.  I was not familiar with many of the actors except maybe Jennifer Morrison.  Not totally blown over by the show just yet but will most likely keep watching just out of blatant curiosity.  It is actually a good idea for a show so I am very much hoping it gets better as the show progresses.  I'll give it only 3 stars, so far, as the acting is just a tad overdramatic at times!  _____Update:  Only have the last episode to view on Netflix!  I really like the costumes on the show, especially when they go to the fairy tale world.  They are so elaborate at times! The show did grow on me a bit after about half way through the show and trying to figure out who is who in the real world which was interesting.  Every one in town has a parallel identity in both worlds except only a very few know in the real world who they are in the fairy tale world.  Every one else is walking around with some amnesia due to the curse carried over from the fairy tale world.  As the show progresses Henry starts to tell certain people who they really are but mostly it is met with disbelief or shrugged off because he is a kid heavily into a book he carries around with him frequently on fairy tales.  Needless to say, Henry has to spend a great deal of time convincing the town folk with not alot of success at times!  As I said at the beginning, some of the acting can be a bit overwrought and overacted at times and yet there are shows that every one is acting with the right balance of emotions!  If you can get past that and some dubious scenes then you should have no problem getting thru, with some enjoyment, to the end of the season.  It is a good idea for a show and not every show is going to be A+ entertainment but that is predictable with most every show out there.  There is at times a few 'clunker episodes' to deal with but all in all the show is entertaining and mildly amusing...  The show is one that you just have to keep watching because it gets its hooks into you.  BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES AND SET DESIGNS ARE SO WORTH WATCHING!!!  CGI looks good in the show as well as some of the buildings, castles, landscapes, etc.... are done that way.  So after watching the whole season I will give it another star and make it 4 stars.  Suprisingly entertaining and the show just gets better as you progress...  Hope that helps!",1358899200,,2663,4.248508946322068

This is a shows that takes place after the Evil Queen brings a curse, to destroy her step daughter's (Snow White) happiness, along with all that are in the land. It also includes, Cinderella, Red Riding Hood and her Granny, and others. The curse brings them to our land and they loose their memory. It also goes back and retells the stories of our beloved fairy tales. It is a very interesting series, and a great hit.",1358208000,,531,4.541666666666667
4607167,5,B0058YPL66,"When rating a book, movie or television series I consider how it holds my attention, how much trash language, amount of violence, & if explicit sexual encounters are included. By just watching the commercials approaching first season I made up my mind NOT to include 'Once Upon a Time'. I discovered a couple of my daughters & some of their friends. So, I gave them 1st season DVD as a gift. They were so enthusiastic I thought I would watch a couple. I began watching with my daughter when we had spare time together. Well, it wasn't long before I was sneaking to watch episodes without my daughter!! Not everyone likes Sci-Fi & some I don't either, but 'Once' has an intriguing story line, no disgusting language, no explicit sex. Well, 2nd season just started...I'm not missing an episode!",1358121600,,792,4.705035971223022
4607168,5,B0058YPL66,"This is one of the most brilliant series ever to come to TV.  For anyone who grew up on the fairytales and fables of Mother Goose, the Brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Andersen, ""Once Upon a Time"" is just plain fun!  The concept is one that most of us probably fantasized about at one time or another when we were children - what would happen if Beauty and the Beast were real, or why can't I have a cricket-sized Conscience to carry around with me?  The cast is perfectly cast, especially Robert Carlyle as Rumplestiltskin, and the interplay between real world scenes and fairytale scenes is a real treasure to watch.  During this first season, part of the fun was discovering who the citizens of Storybrooke were and finding all the different ways they related to one another, both in the real world and in the land of once-upon-a-time.  Lana Parilla is fantastic as the Evil Queen/Mayor, and the pursuit of happy endings by all the characters is an adventure for every viewer, no matter what age.  I cannot wait to own Season Two!",1358121600,,1035,4.5978260869565215

4607268,5,B0058YPL66,"I have been following this show from the start, and I am truly enchanted! I admit, I thought it was a bit cheesy in the first few episodes, but I kept with it and am so glad I did. The characters are truly well developed and the storylines are mixed perfectly. There is plenty of magic, mystery and romance to go around!

It is very uplifting with some great lessons (having faith in those you love, staying true to yourself, believing good will always win...) however, it does NOT shy from darker themes at all. Lives are lost, battles fought, domestic troubles, treachery, its all in there, too!

You will cry, and cheer for certain characters who may not be completely ""bad."" This show really develops the characters, in both worlds (I also love that concept - we get to see them in fairy tale land, and the real world! Brilliant!) The scenary and costumes are also done fabulously.

I do not watch much TV these days, I don't even have cable, but I look forward to this show EVERY week!

We look forward to the next season to be released.  This series is resplendent with beautiful costumes, sets and fine acting.  The whole idea of the series was so novel that you might be put off by a fairy tale that is taken seriously but it really sucks you in quickly because the acting is so good.  The evil queen Regina played by Lana Parilla is outstanding but the actor who really steals the show is Robert Carlyle who plays Mr Gold or Rumpelstiltskin - absolute perfection!",1356480000,,729,4.253623188405797

Once upon a time there was a show that I watched on hulu on breaks inbetween studying for Step 2 CK. A show so wonderful, that I fell in love with it and was motivated to wake up every morning to eat my breakfast and watch before every day's study session...

I bought the season to watch with my significant other as well as other family members. A great show with good twists and turns and dynamic characters. I cannot wait until the 2nd season is available for sale!",1356307200,,500,4.2631578947368425

It puts all the story book characters together in a town called Storybrooke after Snow White's evil stepmother has cast a curse on them removing them to our world with no memories of their former lives. It follows the attempt of Snow White and Prince Charmings grandson to bring back their happy endings and restore their memories, with snippets from former lives intertwined with their current situation. The charachters and their interactions aren't always what we would assume or what we have read in the books, their relationships explained under a different light.

4607525,4,B0058YPL66,"I just found this series on netflix, I hadn't seen it on tv. I LOVE it! I like any show that is clever and original, as this one is in its way, and the acting and characters are great. Yes it gets a little campy at times, but it's supposed to, it's a fairy tale! It is also an extremely welcome departure from all the reality shows and similar rubbish. The storybook costumes and sets are rich, it's just a beautiful thing to watch. I think Lana Parilla must just be having too much fun being evil as all get out and is superbly cast, Snow White looks like Snow White, except I don't like her too-short present day haircut, her hair should be longer, and is there anyone who could do Rumpelstiltskin and Mr Gold better? Whoever plays them was born to do so! Also, I have seen the episode with the child Snow and could that child look any MORE like her adult counterpart? I don't think so. It is my own bias/preference but everyone who is in the book should have dark hair! Blondes don't belong in fairy tales. The only actors who don't do it for me, in my opinion only, is Emma, who looks and acts like someone from the drug culture,and is blonde and looks nothing like Henry, and the boy who plays Henry is really know it all and annoying. If he is in a fairy tale, he shouldn't have a stupid haircut and that smug, irritating voice. I thought the boys who played Bae and Pinocchio fit the look and feel of the show much better. Also, I am not sure who Henry is supposed to be in the book?

I was wondering how they were going to go on with the series, since I thought the endless evil doing by the Queen/Mayor and no one able to do anything to stop her was going to get old. Now I see, as Season 1 is ended, how more troubles are just beginning, as are mine, since I don't have tv and can't see the Season 2 episodes that are on now, and who knows when netflix will have them! Maybe I can make a deal with Mr. Gold...",1356220800,,1919,4.1037234042553195

4607566,5,B0058YPL66,"This show may not appeal to everyone- but it sure has captured my attention and I consider myself a difficult audience.  The first episode you can tell is done on a low budget with costuming and special effects, but as the season grows on, with it's characters, it seems to pull you in- if you have the patience.  I would say Season One of this show has it's ""highs"" and ""lows"" because each episode seems to be about a different storybook character.  Some were done better than others.  You tell yourself, ok, I'm making an ""investment"" in time here (like reading a book) because sometimes the show slows down a bit and focuses on little meanings and such that you as a consumer may not care about or relate to.  The largest story- Emma, the ""savior"" threads into every episode as well as Snow White and the ""Queen"" Regina.  Good show if you're just trying to pass time you will find it has highs and lows.  I LOVE suspense so I'm not as glued to the screen as I was when watching ""Revenge,"" another ABC show.",1355875200,,1009,4.39247311827957

A friend of mine doesn't like how many characters they bring into the show, and how it is hard to follow if you jump in.

Only at the end does it all make sense to you. Join the 11.8 million viewers like me into a world we know from our bed time stories and see what they are like wiped of all past memories living in a land under the control of the evil queen posing as Regina Mills.",1355356800,,394,4.0
4607626,5,B0058YPL66,"Over the course of the last few years, it seems as though fairytales have become all the rage. Comics, TV shows, movies, books, and probably more have taken to re-telling fairytales, and these re-tellings are flying off the shelves. I'm not sure what made so many creative minds suddenly turn to fairytales, but I'm certainly not complaining. Amongst all these new re-tellings is Once Upon a Time, an ABC television drama. While a lot of the modern fairytale stuff I've come across has been good, Once Upon a Time is BY FAR the best.

So, here's the basic plot, for anyone who may not know: The Evil Queen from ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"", after failing in her attempt to poison Snow White with her apple, casts a curse. This curse moves every fairytale character to our world, erases their memories of who they are, and puts all kinds of obstacles in their way to keep them from reaching their happy endings. It's fun to see how some of the characters translate into the real world. The Evil Queen, for example, has become the Mayor of the town all the characters reside in, and Jiminy Cricket is a therapist. Every episode has something going on in our world, and flashbacks to the old fairytale world that show us the characters' backstories and motives. The writing is a lot like the show ""Lost"", as many of its crew are involved in Once Upon a Time, but so far the show isn't nearly as complex or convuluted as Lost was. It is still complex, but not so much that it makes your head explode. I've been telling people that this show is ""Lost Lite"".

The show is an extremely enjoyable ride, and I was hooked almost immediately. Every character has an amazing amount of depth and realism to them, and it's very fun to see such iconic and classic characters done in a way that's so real and so complex. Almost every major character has a huge internet following, and rightfully so. This show has become a massive hit, and it's easy to see why. With its complex characters, storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and inventive reimagining of all the big fairytales, this show is easily the best television to come out in years. I have gotten several of my friends and family to watch the show, and they're all about as obsessed with it as I am. You won't regret giving it a shot!",1355184000,,2298,4.4821002386634845
4607627,5,B0058YPL66,"This is the best show to come out of a network in a long time. I normally stick to my HBO series, for production value and ""edgier"" themes, but this show satisfies immensely. The production value and writing style is right up there with the best premium channel series, and next to ""Game of Thrones"" it is my favorite tv show of the year. Even better, it is actually family friendly. I bought this for my parents when my dad was ill, and I knew they were a bit bored. Since their favorite show is ""Dancing with the Stars"", I figured it was a bit of a risk. They loved it so much they couldn't stop watching it from the first night, and stayed up late just to see what happens. It kept them entertained and my dad kept thanking me over and over for sending it. Of course I had to get one for myself as well!

4607667,5,B0058YPL66,"Once Upon a Time is a TV series involving many well-known fairy tale characters, an evil curse, and an unwitting savior.  This is a fantastic series for people who grew up with the classic Disney movies and their families.  It takes the stories that we all know so well and updates them, giving the characters more depth and the stories more complexity.

In this series, the Evil Queen from Snow White's tale has placed an evil curse upon all the residents of fairy tale land, removing their memories and placing them in our world: a place with no magic and no happy endings.  The emphasis for most of this first season focuses on how and why the evil curse came to be, as well as how Snow White and Prince Charming got together.  The story is not exactly what you would expect.  The show splits its time between the main story playing out in ""our world"" and a corresponding story playing out in fairy tale land that gives us more information about the characters.  It really is a fun show to watch, and attempts to give both its heroes and its villains more complexity than they are given in the original stories.  It is also very family-friendly, and I highly recommend it.",1355011200,,1175,4.509433962264151

4607784,5,B0058YPL66,"From the creators of ""Lost"" and ""Tron: Legacy"" writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz comes a new fantasy-drama television series known as ""Once Upon a Time"".

Originally conceived before Kitsis and Horowitz were involved with ""Lost"", both men wanted to write a fairtytale and the exploration of other worlds. But with their work on ""Lost"", the writers had the opportunity to learn from the process, and while having some allusions to ""Lost"", the series also has allusions to well-known Disney films. But the goal for both writers was to take these characters that people are familiar with and to explore the character and get to learn more about them.  But most importantly, not retelling the exact same story as what people may be familiar with from the original fairy tale.

With the 22-episode series debuting in October 2011 and a season finale in May of 2012, ""Once Upon a Time"" was the highest-rated TV drama for Adults 18-49 and was ABC's biggest debut in five years.  As well as being the highest rated non-sports program to air on Sunday nights.

VIDEO:

""Once Upon a Time: The Complete First Season"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  The picture quality for this series is fantastic.  With its high production value, one expects a lot for this series and for an ABC drama series, one of the few that has been given a Blu-ray release.

Closeups are very good, showing excellent detail from skin pores to the grime on people's faces.  The location shots are breathtaking, especially during the fairytale sequences and costume design also showcase excellent detail.  Skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and I didn't see any problems with banding, especially during the scenes which featured a lot of orange or red.

Overall, picture quality for ""Once Upon a Time: The Complete Season"" was fantastic!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Once Upon a Time"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The series is crystal clear when it comes to dialogue and music.  While the series is center and front-channel driven, I did like how surround channels were used at times during the action sequences but primarily you hear the musical score through the surround channels.  I wished it was bit more immersive when it comes to its lossless soundtrack but the dialogue and music is crystal clear.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Unique, captivating and wonderful... ABC's ""Once Upon a Time"" is a groundbreaking drama series on primetime television.

High production value, writers that come from hit shows such as ""LOST"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and utilizing fairy tale characters, the potential is pretty much unlimited of how far the writers can go.

And what adds to the efficacy of the series is its talented ensemble cast, cinematography and overall direction.

Let's begin with the storyline.  While ""Once Upon a Time"" has been compared to ""LOST"" because of its two timelines, ""LOST"" had its limitations as everyone was stuck on an island and writers could go only go so far with its ensemble cast.  With ""Once Upon a Time"", you're dealing with the small town of Storybrooke, many characters that can be introduced with each episode, characters that can have an impact on another character's modern and fairytale storyline.

As a viewer, you root for the underdogs, which are Emma, the main protagonist and young Henry.  You are captivated by these two characters because Emma is strong, intelligent but she is also alone.  And to have her son that she gave up for adoption wanting her, needing her and accompanying her, it's rather touching.  But then you have this sci-fi side to the story of Henry trying to convince his mother that everyone in Storybrooke is under a curse and are unable to remember their previous life.

And while the modern storyline focuses on Emma and Henry, getting a glimpse of the fairy tale storyline that surround Prince Charming, Snow White, Cinderella, Jiminy Cricket, the Huntsman, to name a few, we start to see a juxtaposition of the lives they lived and how things are going for them in today's modern time.

The acting is magnificent.  Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas as Snow White and Prince Charming have wonderful chemistry and their scenes are quite demanding as they require a lot of action sequences, having them in many costumes and fighting evil anywhere in the forest or via greens creen (or not) near rocky cliffs.  The series also brings a new dynamic to these characters beyond what many of us have read or seen in a Disney film.  Snow White is more authoritative, a go-getter not this character that loves to sing and play with birds.  Her depiction in ""Once Upon a Time"" is fantastic, while Prince Charming is your banal swashbuckling hero but instead of being the driven-man, there is a storyline that revolves twins and one being killed, a moral dilemma which revolves around bloodline and commitment towards marriage and with so much story that goes into their fairytale and modern characters, Goodwin and Dallas have to deliver and they do!

Then you have Lana Parrilla as Regina Mills/Evil Queen.  The actress is able to play the evil character wonderfully, with this scheming look on her face and evil grin.  Casting was on the mark for this character and instead of being an older woman queen, the Evil Queen is given sex appeal and becomes one of the more interesting characters in the series.

And Robert Carlyle, a man who is evil but also a mystery if he can be good or just a person that marches in the beat of his own drum and you don't know whether or not you can trust him.  His character of Rumpelstiltskin may seem a bit weak towards the beginning of the series but you begin to realize that this grimy imp is far from being weak, in fact, he may be the most powerful antagonist of the series but also an antagonist that can either aid the side of good and evil.  Or neither, but himself.  A character that you just don't know what he will do and constantly surprises the viewer by his actions.  Carlyle does an amazing job in playing this character, may it be the psychotic Rumpelstiltskin or the cool and calm Mr. Gold.

Then we have Jennifer Morrison, your protagonist with a no-nonsense, strong Sarah Connor-type of attitude but deep inside, you see her character becoming more emotional as she starts to show her love for the son that she gave up.  I enjoy the character of Emma a lot and for the most part, it's going to be interesting to see how things continue in season 2 with how things were left in the season finale.

The character performances in the series, especially with the supporting talent are well-done as well!

Another big plus is the cinematography and location shots.  From the beautiful location of shooting in the forest for action sequences to shooting in Vancouver for Storybrooke, you get a combination of beautiful location shots along with small town America.  The fairytale storyline is what is most appealing because of its high production value, action sequences and costume design.

And last but not least, the writing of this show is phenomenal.  I'm a big fan of Jane Espenson's work but to also have a few of the writers, especially series creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz of ""LOST"", another series that I enjoyed immensely is a major plus.  Both men had this vision prior to ""Lost"" and it's great to see this type of series on ABC.

The writing is captivating, amazingly well-done and definitely a lot of potential for exploration of other characters which can be utilized whenever. But with the way that season 1 has ended, it will be interesting to see how things go for season 2.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is amazing while lossless soundtrack was crystal clear when it came to dialogue and music, I was hoping for it to be a bit more immersive in utilizing the surround channels and LFE a bit more during the more action-driven scenes.  As for special features, you do get several audio commentary, featurettes including Easter eggs.

Overall, ""Once Upon a Time"" has turned out to be a fantastic sci-fi drama series.  So many positives can be said of the show and at this point of time, there are no negative things I have to say about it.  Granted, this is the first season and hopefully things get better for season 2.

Captivating, addictive and in my opinion, one of the best drama series on television at this time, ""Once Upon a Time"" is a unique, well-acted, well-written drama series that will win you over with its initial pilot episode to its thrilling season final.  It's that good!

The others are tiresome.  I wish they weren't.  I wish I liked this show.  It has everything going for it... and yet, it misses the authentic struggle to make it truly great.  Merlin is an example of how silly premises can still hold real emotional value.  Those characters are connecting in an authentic way.  Maybe Once Upon A Time will get better in time.

4607804,5,B0058YPL66,"Remember, all magic comes with a price - Rumplestiltskin

If you are tired of cop and reality shows-you should give Once Upon A Time a chance. This show is based on fairy tales and goes back and forth from the present time to a realm that is a rich land of fairy tale characters such as: Geppetto, Snow White, Pinnochio, Little Red Riding Hood & Grandma, fairies, the Seven Dwarfs and more. It took my daughters and I about four episodes before we got a handle on what was going on, but once we did, we were blown away!

One bright and shining character is Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold, played brilliantly by Robert Carlyle. His multi-faceted character alone makes this show worth watching. All the characters are very good, but for me, this guy, brings it. I can't say enough good about him. As Mr. Gold he is great, as Rumplestiltskin he is superb.

This show is very layered. We went back and watched the first 6 or 7 episodes and caught all kinds of things we missed the first time we watched. The main idea is this: Henry, an adoptive boy lives in Storybrook. He finds his birth mother, Emma Swan, and takes her back to Storybrook. His teacher has given him a book and in it he finds extraordinary comparisons to people who live in Storybrook. He therefore believes that the whole town is under a spell. His birth mother, Emma, he believes is the only one who can break the spell. The events in Storybrook, mirror the happenings in the fairytale land and Henry and the evil queen (his adoptive mother) are the only ones who really know (especially the queen/mayor of Storybrook) but memories are coming back to some of the characters with the arrival of Emma as the clock begins to tick. Time has actually stood still in Storybrook for 28 years.

Anyway, some episodes are about a single character and their past and some are about Snow White and Prince Charming whose true love might just be the thing that can break the dark curse that hangs over the town. There is a lot to love about this show. It's original and the writing and acting is first rate. Also worth noting are the sets and costumes in fairytale land, they are amazing as is this fresh and special, entertaining series.",1353801600,3,2186,4.526582278481013
4607805,5,B0058YPL66,"I didn't think this had a chance when it first started , but it's a big success and it's even better in it's second series. This one looks great on blu ray and it has good extra features. The cast in this one is a really good one. They help weave the intricate back and forth storylines of the many characters in this show. That helps to make this one of the largest in depth character shows since lost. The interplay between the past and present is quite interesting and the struggle to wake up the townspeople to who they really are is well worth the payoff. In fact they could have kept the storyline going for one more series but decided to open it up , which took guts to be sure. The fairy tale storys are interwoven with lewis carrol stories as well as peter pan stories. They haven't added the 'wizard of oz' yet though! Still this is a adult drama and characters do die and have to deal with their relationships as well. This one beat the odds to become a hit and it deserves that status. The effects are top notch too. and thanks to the state of technology today more and more shows monsters and such look real or close to real. They couldn't have done this show justice 10 years ago tech wise. I can only imagine what is coming in the future. At least we have this fine show to watch that will hopefully enchant us for many seasons to come! the blu ray is way up in quality as far compared to the dvd set.

4607872,4,B0058YPL66,"Once Upon A Time (2011) is definitely an intriguing show that has a story-plot that hasn't really been explored too much on TV. With that said the show excels in many areas such as being able to integrate the ""Fairy Tale"" world with the ""Real World"" (Storybrooke, Maine) and still be able to make sense. Additionally, the show has a great ensemble of incredibly talented actors and actresses such as Jennifer Morrison (from critically acclaimed drama - ""House"") and Ginnifer Goodwin.

4608163,5,B0058YPL66,"Season 1 of this show was excellent.  The storytelling was great and the characters were all extremely interesting.  The dual-storytelling of the fairy tale characters and their real-world equivalents made the show seem much faster paced and intriguing.  The show also managed to surprise me with some twists that I did not see coming.

All in all, a great show.",1351987200,,362,4.983333333333333
4608164,2,B0058YPL66,"After watching season 1 of ""Once Upon a Time"" I realize one thing for sure, I didn't like it. But I wanted too. I kept waiting for something to happen, something, anything that would give a spark to the show. The only characters that were interesting were the Queen and Rumpelstiltken. Don't get me wrong, I like the concept of Fairy tale characters living in modern times; which is why I kept watching, (though I fast forward the last three episodes) but the writing did nothing that would make me want to watch this show again.",1351814400,2,529,4.520833333333333
4608165,4,B0058YPL66,"I started watching season 1 right when season 2 was beginning.  I had taken advantage of my Amazon Prime account over the summer and watched all of the seasons of Lost and loved it, which got me interested in this show.  The quality of the stream (not HD) was very good and only had to refresh once or twice.  I also downloaded episodes to my Kindle Fire quickly and the playback was great.  This show has an interesting take on traditional fairy tales, but I must say I was not familiar with all of the fairy tale characters - maybe that's my age (28) or that I'm a guy, I'm not sure, but my fiance was familiar with all of the characters.  I think the writers do an amazing job interweaving the stories and have now begun watching season 2 on my DVR.

The stories can be a little ""out there"" at times, but who doesn't need a little break from reality and believability?

As for my personal rating system, I reserve 5 stars for my favorites of any genre.  In this case, 5 stars would go to shows like 24, Dexter, and The Shield.  As for the quality of the streaming video and downloads, they would both get a 5 from me.  I was very satisfied.",1351814400,,1143,4.225806451612903

4608168,5,B0058YPL66,"People that live in Storybrooke, stay in Storybrooke unless they want something bad to happen to them.  Strangers never come to Storybrooke, that is until Emma arrives.  Emma is reluctantly brought to Storybrooke by Henry, the son she gave up for adoption at birth.  Henry believes that all the inhabitants of Storybrooke are characters of fairy tales and that they are stuck in Storybrooke/in time unless Emma stays in Storybrooke and breaks the curse.  He believes that Emma is the daughter of Snow White and that his adoptive mother who is also the Mayor of Storybrooke is actually the evil witch AKA Snow White's stepmother.  He convinces Emma to stay and that's when things begin to happen in Storybrooke.

Now many may make comparison to this show with Grimm because they both deal with fairy tales but whereas Grimm deals with monsters, Once Upon A Time deals with good versus evil.  I think that the creator of this show is brilliant because in each episode, the stories correlate the past with the present.  At first it might be difficult to get a feel for this series and how it works but stick with a couple of episodes and you will see how creative this show is.  You will want to watch the show and root for Emma to bring down the wicked witch, for Snow White to find Prince Charming, etc...I think for me the biggest reason to watch this show is not to see if Emma will break the curse.  Of course we all know that good will always triumph over evil.  The main reason I watch the show is because I want to know who is the bigger villain.  Is it the Mayor or the mysterious Mr. Gold.  What's his role in the curse?

I was getting tired of watching shows about cops, doctors, lawyers (no offense to those professions) and I refuse to watch reality TV so I was glad when I stumbled upon this show and came on Amazon and bought the Season 1 DVD.  Great investment, many hours of entertainment so far.  I am zipping through the first season so I can start watching the second season episodes on my DVR.",1351555200,2,2011,4.453551912568306

Loved this show and will definitely be grabbing season 2 on DVD to get the extras and so I can watch without ad interruptions every 5 minutes plus the fact that tv actually cut the show to fit more ads in so viewers end up missing bits here and there!!!

Almost every episode of the first season plays heavily into the overall plot, with only one or two ""fillers."" Most of the actors are perfectly cast and have you attached to their characters within a few episodes. The intertwining of the disparate stories is well done and logical.

I have been pleased with the DVD set itself. I like the slip cover and the case being from the two different sides. There are numerous episode commentaries, a blooper reel, deleted scenes, and several charming featurettes.",1350950400,,745,4.470588235294118

I would recommend this action packed show to anyone who loves drama, mystery, love or suspense. In order to fully enjoy this episode you need to have watched all those that come before.",1350864000,,324,4.225806451612903
4608331,4,B0058YPL66,"I remember being really excited for this show before it started airing. I've always loved fairytales, and this show seemed like it would be right up my alley. When it actually started airing on tv I saw the first two episodes and ended up actually being somewhat disappointed. The show had failed to hook my interest from the beginning, so I stopped watching.

It wasn't until the show came out on DVD that I decided to give it another chance. I still found myself uninterested and disappointed in the first two episodes, but I stuck with it. With each episode I found myself getting more and more into the show. I think as the show went on it got a little better with each episode.

Personally, I think Mr Gold/Rumpelstiltskin steals the show. I find his character the most interesting and the most fleshed out. The episodes that center around him are definitely some of my favorites.

As I said before, I think the further you get into the show the better it gets. I think the Huntsman episode is where I really got hooked. I like that fact that they give us back stories for familiar characters. Specifically, I loved how they went about showing how Rumpelstiltskin and Regina came to be they way they are. So often the villains are evil only because the story needs an antagonist, but the fact that the writers went to the trouble of showing us their pasts actually makes the audience understand how they came to be the people they are and even feel for them.

The reason I'm giving this show four stars instead of five is because I feel the first couple of episodes were lacking something that should have really had me hooked from the very beginning. Despite that, overall I ended up really enjoying the show and will probably watch it many times.",1350777600,2,1753,4.555555555555555

4608337,5,B0058YPL66,"Episodic TV tends to drag on giving few answers week to week. This series shows you what happened at the end then goes back and fills in the details. Amazingly consistent from start to finish. I started watching mid-series and new certain aspects of the story that was not revealed yet, and say how they were able to hint but not spoil the surprises ahead.

The villains have a backstory - you actually begin to understand and sometimes sympathize with them.

I think this is my favorite series of all time. And that they wrapped up the major plot point in season one is fantastic. I was satisfied at the end and ready for the next chapter in Season 2.

The Blu-Ray features were fun to listen to and watch. Finding out that most of the fairytale land sets are CGI blew me away. Sure some of the over the top stuff like the dragons would have to be, but as far as simple (and not so simple rooms) I had no idea. It's that well done.",1350518400,,932,4.254237288135593

4608514,5,B0058YPL66,"Wow! This show is like a breath of fresh air. This is just the kind of show that television networks really needed. It's a serious antidote to all the sitcoms, crime dramas, and reality shows that seem to fill network television air times.

This is fantasy story-telling, for modern times. While the language used in the ""fantasy world"" scenes seem too modern for the usual fantasy genre, it fits perfectly here. Again, this is a fairy tale for modern times. This ain't a stage production of Shakespeare. What it is, is a story being told to viewers of all ages and not some high-minded theatre. And it does not pretend to be. The production quality is very high, and the special effects from the Season 1 Finale are just as good as what you would find anywhere in television. And that includes HBO. I would go out on a limb and say that the production and special effects on this show rival, if not exceed, those from the highly-regarded Game of Thrones.

Lana Parrilla (Regina/Evil Queen) is probably one of the more interesting villains on television today. Her character is well-developed, capable of both good and evil. Admittedly, she usually chooses the latter approach in most of her dealings. Her motivations for her hatred of Snow White (Mary Margaret in modern times) is something that the audience can relate to. Well, some of the audience. This is a story that crosses both time and space. The games being played between Regina, Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold, and Snow White take place simultaneously across time. Love and hatred, revenge and vengeance, know no bounds it would seem.

And what a terrific job Jared Gilmore had done, playing Henry. I cannot remember a scene in which he has acted badly. Here we are, 23 episodes done and he just continues to shine. The rest of the cast are no less spectacular. This is a show full of good acting.  And more importantly, this is a show with some of the best writers around.  Terrific writing , casting, and directing.

So what is the show about? What can I write that would not spoil the plot for you? Ok, here are the basics. Young Snow White makes a big mistake, which resulted in a very painful loss for Regina. Regina turns to dark magic and vows revenge on Snow White. Meanwhile, a humble Rumplestiltskin (played by Robert Carlisle) decides to take the power of the Dark One for himself in order to no longer be the coward that he is known for. Snow White grows into a young woman, all the while running and hiding from Regina, who has become Queen. Meanwhile, she meets up with James, known as Prince Charming. Every move that Regina makes to take her revenge on Snow White has failed. Somehow, Snow and her friends always managed to dodge and foil Regina's attacks. But, not to be outdone (hate is a powerful motivator after all), Regina makes one very bold move. One that would affect the entire realm. She puts together a curse that transported everyone in the realm, into a world without magic. Yes, our world. And without their memories intact! That is the curse, to live in a miserable world, never remembering who they once were. But all curses can be broken. A master carpenter named Gepetto creates a box, from the wood of an enchanted tree. And in that box, the daughter of Prince Charming and Snow White was placed, in order to protect her from the curse. She gets sent to the future along with the others, but because of the protection afforded by the magic chest, she has abilities that protect her from Regina, who is now the town mayor. The daughter, Emma (played by Jennifer Morrison), ends up in Boston. Young Emma grows up bouncing from one foster home to another. She gets pregnant at 17 and makes a decision to give up her baby (Henry), to give him the best chance in life.  Young Pinocchio, smuggled into the enchanted box by Gepetto, was given the task to take care of Emma.  But, ofcourse, loses himself in this new world and forgets his duty.

Just like the very best and most engrossing of all stories, this one is equally driven by plot and by character. Perhaps one of the more touching character plots here is that of Pinocchio. Great acting from Eion Bailey, Ralph Sbarge (Jiminy Cricket), and Tony Amendola (Gepetto).  Robert Caslisle is just having too much fun playing the dual roles of Mr. Gold and Rumplestiltskin.  And Lee Arenberg plays the dual roles of Grumpy the dwarf, and LeRoy the custodian.  Ginnifer Godwin, Jennifer Morrison, Josh Davis, Emilie DeRahvin, Sebastian Stan, and Beverley Elliott round out the stellar cast.

In my view, this is the best show on network television right now. Perhaps equal to Game of Thrones. The latter ofcourse is for mature audiences only. Once Upon A Time is a show that everyone can enjoy. There's something there for everyone. With so many characters, and so many plot lines, you are sure to find one that will keep you tuned in week after week. And, if you missed Season 1 and are slow to catch on, you've got many choices as far as streaming or downloading, renting or buying.  You can buy or rent here at Amazon.

I was looking forward to get this Blu-ray and the three to four month wait after pre-ordering it was worth every minute. First off, I think this is a great show, because it just isn't mainly a kid show, but a show for the whole family to enjoy. Every actor/actress in the show I feel do their roles superbly from the lead actor and lead actress to best supporting actor and actress to everyone else. I have not been disappointed at with the performance of each person. Also this blu-ray has great audio commentary to certain episodes on each disc by the directors, and actors/actresses. The special features on this blu-ray is awesome and really delves into the fairy tales that we have grown to know and bring the real life beginning of how they were started. All in all Once Upon A Time Season One on Blu-Ray is definitely worth the buy, and I recommend those who haven't purchased this blu-ray or watched the show to do it! A great show, great performances, great drama, and simply amazing! Love this show, and I can't wait for Once Upon A Time Season Two to come out on blu-ray!",1349395200,,1150,4.378504672897196

Looking forward to season two!!!,1349395200,,335,4.333333333333333
4608552,5,B0058YPL66,"Wow!  This show is like a breath of fresh air.  This is just the kind of show that television networks really needed.  It's a serious antidote to all the sitcoms, crime dramas, and reality shows that seem to fill network television air times.

This is fantasy story-telling, for modern times.  While the language used in the ""fantasy world"" scenes seem too modern for the usual fantasy genre, it fits perfectly here.  Again, this is a fairy tale for modern times.  This ain't a stage production of Shakespeare.  What it is, is a story being told to viewers of all ages and not some high-minded theatre.  And it does not pretend to be.  The production quality is very high, and the special effects from the Season 1 Finale are just as good as what you would find anywhere in television.  And that includes HBO.  I would go out on a limb and say that the production and special effects on this show rival, if not exceed, those from the highly-regarded Game of Thrones.

Lana Parrilla (Regina/Evil Queen) is probably one of the more interesting villains on television today.  Her character is well-developed, capable of both good and evil.  Admittedly, she usually chooses the latter approach in most of her dealings.  Her motivations for her hatred of Snow White (Mary Margaret in modern times) is something that the audience can relate to.  Well, some of the audience.  This is a story that crosses both time and space.  The games being played between Regina, Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold, and Snow White take place simultaneously across time.  Love and hatred, revenge and vengeance, know no bounds it would seem.

And what a terrific job Jared Gilmore had done, playing Henry.  I cannot remember a scene in which he has acted badly.  Here we are, 23 episodes done and he just continues to shine.  The rest of the cast are no less spectacular.  This is a show filled with good acting.  In my opinion, Robert Carlyle and Lana Parrilla deserve all the credit and all the recognition that they've been getting.

So what is the show about?  What can I write that would not spoil the plot for you?  Ok, here are the basics.  Young Snow White makes a big mistake, which resulted in a very painful loss for Regina.  Regina turns to dark magic and vows revenge on Snow White.  Meanwhile, a humble Rumplestiltskin (played by Robert Carlisle) decides to take the power of the Dark One for himself in order to no longer be the coward that he is known for.  Snow White grows into a young woman, all the while running and hiding from Regina, who has become Queen.  Meanwhile, she meets up with James, known as Prince Charming.  Every move that Regina makes to take her revenge on Snow White has failed.  Somehow, Snow and her friends always managed to beat back Regina's attacks.  But, not to be outdone (hate is a powerful motivator after all), Regina makes one very bold move.  One that would affect the entire realm.  She puts together a curse that transported everyone in the realm, into a world without magic.  Yes, our world.  And without their memories intact!  That is the curse, to live in a miserable world, never remembering who they once were.  But all curses can be broken.  A master carpenter named Gepetto creates a box, from the wood of an enchanted tree.  And in that box, the daughter of Prince Charming and Snow White was placed, in order to protect her from the curse.  She gets sent to the future along with the others, but because of the protection afforded by the magic chest, she has abilities that protect her from Regina, who is now the town mayor.  The daughter, Emma (played by Jennifer Morrison), ends up in Boston.  Young Emma grows up bouncing from one foster home to another.  She gets pregnant at 17 and makes a decision to give up her baby (Henry), to give him the best chance in life.

Just like the very best and most engrossing of all stories, this one is equally driven by plot and by character.  Perhaps one of the more touching character plots here is that of Pinocchio and his father Gepetto.  Great acting from Eion Bailey and from Tony Amendola.

In my view, this is the best show on network television right now.  Perhaps equal to Game of Thrones. The latter ofcourse is for mature audiences only.  Once Upon A Time is a show that everyone can enjoy.  There's something there for everyone.  With so many characters, and so many plot lines, you are sure to find one that will keep you tuned in week after week.  And, if you missed Season 1 and are slow to catch on, this DVD set is just the ticket.",1349308800,,4524,4.5767790262172285
4608553,5,B0058YPL66,"Some of ABC's best ratings of 2011 came in a surprise seasonal package. Its premise revolved around something most shows haven't tackled but viewers everywhere are enthralled with, and finally, it has made its way into my living room.

Once upon a time is where each story begins... but not every ending is happily ever after. Some cannot be altered by the perfect fit of a glass slipper or true love's kiss. Sometimes, the memories are stripped away leaving everyone who deserves a happy end lost to everyone they once loved. Every story has a beginning and Emma's is one bad memory after another. Abandoned as an infant by the side of the road, Emma (Jennifer Morrison) grew up in the foster care system never feeling loved or wanted. In the twenty plus years since then, she has learned to let no one in and relied solely on herself. On her 28th birthday, Emma is doing what she does best, catching the bad guys. She boasts two specials skills, one is being able to tell when someone is lying and the other is finding people. Today she is using the latter skill in her job as a bounty hunter while young Henry Mills (Jared Gilmore) has finally found Emma - his mother. Ten years ago Emma gave up a child for adoption, a son who landed in the sleepy town of Storybrooke and the son of Mayor Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla). Emma's trip to return Henry to his mother baffles her almost as much as the tale Henry spins.

Henry's story is one that only fairy-tales are made of; he claims that every person living in Storybrooke is really one from the book of fairy tales his teacher Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) gave him. None of them know who they are or where they came from and are being held captive by a spell created by the evil queen, Regina. Emma's destiny is to break the curse as the daughter of Snow White - whom Henry claims is his teacher, Mary Margaret, and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas). The fate of everyone rests on Emma's shoulders but first she must come up against not only Regina but also her cohorts... and what is the mysterious Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) about?

Already home to my favorite (or one of them - depends on what day of the week you ask me) shows, Castle, ABC was 2-for-2 in the 2011 television season when it came to finding new shows to be entertained by. The only thing overruling viewer's curiosity about this delight of a show is the credibility of some characters - we are constantly on our guard with each one though through it all that speaks of a fabulous cast, which this show has. Every actor puts his or her best into their roles and each evil look or kind gesture is always made clear through their expressions of acting because, well... they are that good. Also included in the recurring cast list is Meghan Ory, Raphael Sbarge, Anastasia Griffith ('Royal Pains'), David Anders, Emilie de Ravin, Jessy Schram and Eion Bailey ('Covert Affairs') as a mysterious stranger in addition to a host of others. What is perhaps so great about these characters (and they are fabulous!) is that it is left up to us to find out who they are. Unlike most shows, in `Once,' writer's don't hand out information readily - we are instead asked to uncover the good, and the bad of each person.

For a show that I expected to love (so, I am a lover of sappy stories - you aren't just now figuring that out, are ya'!?) I was shocked that I was more enamored with the ""real world"" than the fairy-tale. Though pretty to look at, from a scenic perspective, none of the costumes or make-up appeals to our vision of authentic to the fairy-tale world. Similarly save for the outdoor scenes, the settings are modern and really, too ""big."" Those transitions between fairy-tale and real world are usually well timed but for a girl who was expecting to find the fantasy elements of the show more interesting, I was surprised at how caught up in the modern counterparts I was. Just as I was hooked, the show backspaced to storybook land which sometimes upset the intensity of a scene but is after all, the best way to keep suspense - and the viewer, on top of things.

Regardless of petty complaints, this show was very whimsical in its own fashion. It's really quite clever in the ways it introduces and compacts so many fairy-tales into one story and world. No matter what you may think of it, your initial perspective of it may be turned upside down. It strengthens the further it investigates each character and it features every genre you could possible want; mystery, drama, comedy, romance, fantasy, all in a package that effortlessly cumulates together forming a beautiful if not sometimes transparent story. If there was only one thing I would wish television did different, it'd be the song-and-dance it puts its lovers - or would-be lovers through. I ""get"" the need for complications and incentive but this particular scenario is running amuck with such stories so please give Snow/Mary Margaret and Charming/David more than a tragedy and stolen glances. Believe me, I will still watch, as would the hundreds of fans. The more happiness, characters are given even in strife, the happier fans will be. Or maybe I am just speaking for myself but... from experience, I seriously doubt it. The good guys need some victories as happily ever after can never be snatched from beloved characters and the sooner writer's realize that, the better off they will be.

4608696,5,B0058YPL66,"""Where are we going?"", a tearful Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) asks as her fairy-tale world is obliterated by an unholy curse. ""Somewhere horrible,"" her Stepmother, the Evil Queen  Regina (Lana Parrilla) declares in wicked triumph, ""Somewhere absolutely horrible!""
  Thus, Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, creators of ""Lost"", trap beloved fairy-tale characters between two worlds; literally stuck in time and space, in the ingenious series ""Once Upon A Time."" The horrible place they are all going is our ""Real World""; A Land Without Magic."" The enchanted fairy tale kingdom is transformed into Storybrooke, Maine. Everyone is suffering from a 28 year case of amnesia; without any memories of their identities or past lives. Everyone except, of course, Regina and the devilish, devious Rumpilstilskin (Robert Carlyle), who is known as Mr. Gold in Storybrooke. Regina installs herself as the despotic mayor of Storybrooke and believes she holds all the cards. But Mr. Gold has a few nasty tricks up his sinister sleeve as well.
  Regina certainly hadn't counted on her adopted son Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) traveling up to Boston to find his biological mother Emma (Jennifer Morrison). Henry arrives with a huge ""Once Upon A Time"" Storybook. He insists that fairy tales are real,  and tells Emma that she is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Moreover, Henry relates, Emma is the only one who can break the Storybrooke curse. At first, Emma thinks Henry is fairy-tale crazy. But, upon arrival in Storybrooke, she finds it impossible to leave. An all out war between Regina and Emma is quickly declared; with  Emma seriously doubting she is the chosen one to break the curse. Meanwhile, Snow White is now schoolteacher Mary Margaret Blanchard. Her Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) is a ""John Doe"" named David Nolan. Having spent the majority of the curse in a coma, David wakes up to find himself with a wife named Katherine he has no memory of; but he knows he loves Mary Margaret. Regina, of course, will stop at nothing to keep them apart; going so far as to frame Mary Margaret for Katharine's murder and locking her up in jail.
  ""Time"" moves deftly and expertly between the two alternate worlds of Storybrooke and the Enchanted Fairy Tale Kingdom. Kitsis and Horowitz are wise and careful not to reveal too much character back-story or motivation too soon; making the series a truly addictive experience. Late in the season, in the episode ""The Stable Boy"", we do learn that Regina's hatred of Snow White is tragically mis-directed. This gives Regina  layers  of depth and pathos; without ever excusing her murderous actions in the earlier episodes ""The Thing You Love Most"" and ""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter."" Other fairy tale characters, such as Jiminey Cricket, Pinocchio, Gepetto,  Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, and Belle, also appear in a few episodes. ""Red-Handed"", the series spin on ""Little Red Riding Hood"", is just  plain weird.
  As the ""villains"" of ""Time"", Lana Parrilla and Robert Carlyle are outstanding. And you'll root for Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas as the separated Snow White-Prince Charming/Mary Margaret Blanchard-David Nolan. Goodwin is particularly effective as a feisty, self-aware Snow White. As her Prince ""James""  Charming, Josh Dallas is every bit as courageous, dashing and devoted as we could wish for.
  The episodes ""Pilot"", ""7:15 A.M."", ""Skin Deep"",""  The Stable Boy""  and the intense Season Finale ""A Land Without Magic""  include optional audio commentaries. Disc 5 contains several entertaining Behind The Scenes extras.",1348963200,6,3575,5.150519031141869

4608854,3,B0058YPL66,"You know that thing they do in soap operas where things drag on for episode after episode and although the audience knows exactly what's going on, the characters don't seem to be able to figure anything out? Time after time, they almost figure something out or they get a tiny piece of the puzzle...and something thwarts them at the last second? You watch the villains hatch and carry out scheme after scheme on the clueless victims, or sometimes the ""good"" characters bully the ""villains"" into becoming what they are. You just want the story to progress instead of almost progressing over and over? You start to feel almost angry that the ""heroes"" are so clueless or frustrated that they can't catch a break. You keep watching because you really want to see how interesting and dramatic it gets when everything is out in the open...but it doesn't happen...That's how this series gets in Season 1.
I started off really liking this. Until I just got frustrated.
It's about a woman, a bounty hunter who gets tracked down by the kid she gave up for adoption. He takes her back to a town cursed by an evil queen where fairy tale characters from another world have lost their memories and are living out new lives. It's addictive and suspenseful. Fairytales are re-spun and re-told. Some good, some not.. Snow White and her Prince have a very different version of the story here, that is interesting and unique. Snow White is a thief and a bandit that tries to rob the prince and then...but in the cursed world, the Prince (without his memory) is a complete tool. He lies to Snow White and breaks her heart over and over, dating two women at once. The main character refuses to believe in the curse no matter how much proof she gets. Beauty and the Beast is turned into a farce with Belle falling in love with old evil man Rumplestillskin. The episodes story switches between the cursed town in present time, and telling background stories from the past fairy tail land to introduce new characters and reveal more of the background on them. Which is very well calculated and enjoyable to watch.
However...
Time and time again both villain characters control every aspect of things so that just when you think the truth is coming out...something happens and it's back to everyone being in the dark and clueless. It happens in the present time and in the fairy tale past and it gets old fast. Example...after Snow is about to go to the Prince(in fairy tale past), the king convinces her to lie to save his life and walk away. After several more JUST misses, it is beyond annoying. It is building a story about how they have overcome so much to be together, but after it keeps happening over and over, it stops being believable. AGAIN? Really?
FORTUNATELY I was able to skip from episode 8 or so to reading episode summaries and then straight to the season finale where the truth is revealed. Now that the truth is out I can watch season 2, but the middle episodes just drag on and make you want to bang your head against a wall in frustration! Here is hoping they don't make the same mistake twice! Just as the pay-off comes...no, sorry guys back to the beginning and 3 more episodes going in circles until they might almost figure out a clue to go forwards.
If you dislike soap operas, and you like the show and the story, try the same route I did, but maybe a little sooner. Had I done that, I might not be trying to get over a huge dislike for the Prince who they made into a cheater and liar, and then magically morphed him into a hero again in the end. But if these characters are part their fairy tale selves and part the new modern cursed versions with no memories...it still makes the Prince a tool afterwards.

UPDATE: I really liked Season 2. Struggle through and keep watching!",1348358400,3,3781,4.543988269794721
4608855,5,B0058YPL66,"1st Note: I've seen every episode of season 1 with XFinity On Demand.

2nd Note: A few hours ago, I rewatched the intense season finale of Once Upon A Time to warm up for Season 2 which premieres one week from today on ABC with new episodes available the day after they air with XFinity On Demand and online at their website.

The first season of Once Upon A Time has been a thrilling rollar coaster ride, with every episode providing a great story and all of it building up to the most action-packed, romantic, epic, heart-warming & heart-breaking episode of the season. I decided to watch the final two episodes back-to-back, and I'm glad I did so, as the 21st episode ends on a shocking cliffhanger that leaves you aching to watch episode 22. And should you choose to follow the same path I did in viewing the final two episodes back-to-back, the reward is much greater than if you watch one episode a day or so apart. The acting in the series is excellent and the writing is top-notch.

Not only is the entire season family-friendly (no graphic violence, mild-to-moderate language and no sexual situations), but the storylines are absolutely excellent. There are cleverly placed references to the classic Disney movies which have been made out of these fairy tales. Disney has graciously allowed the use of their characters in the films for this series, and it's not a gimmick. Trust me. And there are more surprises in store, dearie...

4608856,2,B0058YPL66,"After being put under a spell a group of fairytale characters are brought into our reality. All the famous story book characters are there in the small quiet town of story brook. The only one aware of who the identities of the towns folk is the one who cast the spell in the first place. The Evil Queen Sorceress who put them all under her spell for the sake of her own happiness. I'm not sure what that happiness is because she looks to live a lonely life still. Anyhow the show plays out with a ridiculous start. A bounty woman is confronted by a 10yo boy who turns out to be her abandoned child. The boy leads the woman back to his hometown of Story Brook. Now here is the part about the show that is why I give it 2/5. The kid is annoying and he's in every scene. The story can do without the long lost child plot if it was just a mystery to be unsolved. Instead of that you have a whiny tag along through every scene who only serves as ""plot exposition"". His role isn't really necessary and it seems awkward that he is even placed into the show. The show is already about a long lost child and now it becomes about a long lost child that has had a long lost child...not sure what the writers were thinking.

Aside from annoying characters the other parts of the show are quite interesting. The ""real world"" the fairytale characters live in isn't so much the ""real world"" it's more of a ""picture perfect sunshine and smiles"" town that in itself is an unrealistic fantasy compared to the actual real world. That would be the second problem with the overall design of the show. The punishment of the curse is to bring the fairytale characters into the real word where they will live in the misery of reality but they all seem to be just living fine in a peaceful little town.

The curse is more of an amnesia trick to make the characters forget who they are but, who they've become seems to be better people than they are in their story book world in some cases... so that is also another strange part to the story. To enjoy ""Once Upon A Time"" you really have to put your mind on cruise and just take the show for what it is. It's a light hearted series and should be treated like that. I enjoyed watching it but, somethings I felt could have made it much better like removing the kid for one and just letting Emma figure out what's going on through her own methods.

Each episode is broken up into the actual fairy tale about a fantasy character and their present day life. You get to learn just enough about them but their stories are never really finished. So what you get are broken clips of a fairytale with no ending. The fairy tales in Once Upon A Time are loosely based around the real stories. They are actually written pretty well to tie the story together. I enjoyed Little Red Riding hood's story the most. I've so far watched 20 episodes of the series and still find a lot of the show to be overly cheesy. The mixture of good actors and bad actors trying to sell you the reality of a fantasy world come true doesn't help. Where some actors are very strong others are weak and don't exactly bring you into the story like they should. I mostly watch the show for Regina and to see what plot she can come up with. When you have a show full of mostly annoying characters you just find yourself rooting for the bad guys.",1348272000,13,3330,4.265822784810126
4608857,5,B0058YPL66,"""Once Upon a Time"" is the only new television program which I watched regularly during the 2011-12 TV season, and it can be appreciated equally well by both adults and children.

  The show's plotline is cleverly constructed to mix its fairy-tale/fantasy elements with a somewhat drab modern-world existence in the sleepy little Maine town of Storybrooke, which none of its original residents are able to leave--unfortunate events always seem to befall those who try to do so. Each episode consists of a story line set in the ""Enchanted Forest,"" the fairy-tale/fantasy world, along with a parallel one set in Storybrooke involving the modern-day counterparts of the fantasy characters, although the two story lines don't necessarily end up the same way.

  Trapped in Storybrooke by a powerful magical curse unleashed by the Evil Queen (Mayor Regina Mills in the town), the other residents there begin the series living a literally timeless, basically unchanging existence while the Queen gloats over them in triumph--of course none of them are conscious of their situation, but they are however aware of their lives being dominated by her in Storybrooke.

  The purported rescuer of the magically-cursed town is Emma Swan, an orphan seemingly abandoned after her birth, who is manipulated into coming to Storybrooke (from Boston) on her twenty-eighth birthday by her biological son, ten-year-old Henry Mills, who is the adopted child of the mayor. (Emma and Henry are the only regular characters without ""Enchanted Forest"" counterparts.)

  There are ongoing subplots in Storybrooke involving numerous other characters, notably the star-crossed romance between Mary Margaret Blanchard (Snow White), Henry's fourth grade teacher, and David Nolan (Prince Charming), who starts the series as a hospital patient in a coma, and the machinations of the program's other major villain, the mysterious pawn shop proprietor Mr. Gold (Rumplestiltskin), who owns much of the town. (As Gold explains to Emma about the townspeople, ""They're afraid of Madame Mayor, but they're more afraid of me."")

  The fantasy parts of the ongoing story don't always exactly match the classic fairy-tale plotlines, although they're at least similar enough to be easily identifiable, and (unlike the modern-day parts) they're not necessarily shown in chronological order--so it's valuable to view the different episodes more than once to appreciate how the 'pieces of the puzzle' fit together. There are sublties within each episode that analytical adults should be able to appreciate, including some of the characters' names, while children would certainly enjoy the skillful and innovative presentation of the fairy-tale/fantasy elements.

  This is a television series whose episodes can be viewed more than 'once upon a time' and still be quite entertaining...",1348272000,,2836,5.480459770114942
4608918,5,B0058YPL66,"ABC really has landed a hit with Once Upon A Time.
The show is amazing with the depth of every character and of course being unique helps too.
I've never seen a show quite like this and it's nice that it is something entirely different from every other show in TV.
The actors are great and chosen well for their characters.
I especially like Lana Parrilla in her role as the Evil Queen/Regina Mills.

4608919,3,B0058YPL66,"I admit to being hooked on this show, but mostly for the concept.  There is something second rate about the characterizations and the scripts and so on that is somewhat offputting: the really intriguing parts of the show are the twists on the original versions, but much of the working out of them is less inspired: the shock value -- which the writers do a lot of -- wears off after a couple of minutes, and one is back into conspiracies and such.  It is interesting that fairy tales are so deeply archetypal, and so trying to ""ordinari-ize"" them ought not to work, but the barrenness of contemporary life makes for a nice foil against the faery world.  I just wish it was a little wilder. (Though now that Season 2 is underway, it is in fact getting a bit wilder -- anything Jane Espensen is involved with is always intriguing).

The weirdest thing about the show is the obsession with nuns.  What is that about? (The last virgins on earth, perhaps?)",1348185600,3,952,4.511627906976744
4608920,3,B0058YPL66,"Personally, I am completely over the myriad of crime drama franchises and supposed ""reality"" shows, so Once Upon A Time has been a welcome addition to my TV viewing. This is not among the greatest shows in the history of TV, the special effects won't win awards, two of the lead characters are rather vanilla and predictable, and the writers have some tweaking to do as they roll into season 2. However, the show has some redeeming qualities:

--For those of us who grew up on fairy tales (especially the Disney versions), it's refreshing to see these stories told with a new twist and a more 21st century take. For example, we're actually given a more meaty reason as to why the Evil Queen hates Snow White, instead of the standard having-to-be-the-fairest-one-of-all nonsense.

--Lana Parilla's Evil Queen/Regina Mills is constantly driven, relentlessly selfish and a vicious individual--and yet she creates moments where you actually feel for her (at least a little bit).

--Robert Carlyle's Rumpelstiltskin/Mr. Gold is manipulative, sneaky, and almost always out for himself--and he somehow makes you like him as he's plotting and pulling all those strings.

There are other positives, but to delve much further would reveal too much of the show for those who've yet to see it. Suffice it to say that, yes, Once Upon A Time is admittedly not the best show on TV. BUT, for what it is, it's a splendid change of pace and a welcome reprieve from the crime-laden, voyeur-rich, lowest common denominator fare that currently dominates television.",1348185600,21,1544,4.996108949416342
4608921,5,B0058YPL66,"When I first saw the promo, this show seemed like it was made for a child audience. I didn't watch the show until about half-way through the season and I fell in love with it. Most of the characters are very interesting (especially the core characters), the plot is very creative, and it can appeal to both children and adults. The story being told between two worlds may be a little confusing at first, but it mellows out within a couple episodes. The cgi can be a little distracting at times, but for me it adds to the fact that the show is about storybook characters. If you watch this show, however, do not expect to see an exact re-telling or expect it to be like another fantasy adaptaion. The characters stories are intertwined, and the show does not base itself on one adaptation. The show borrows from the original stories and from the disney adaptions (if the story in question has one)while also making sure most of it is the show's own creation.

As for the bonus features of the disc, they are mainly used for insight into the production process.

You can find a few of the episodes on the ABC website. Give them a try to see if this is the type of show that will appeal to you.",1347926400,,1191,4.36036036036036
4608922,4,B0058YPL66,"Overall, I really like Once Upon a Time (which I will mostly refer to as OUAT for the majority of this review.) It's a more original show, as opposed to the bazillion crime dramas and raunchy comedies that are clogging up the air time. The idea itself is pretty interesting: What if all your fairy tale characters were sent to our world?

Now, I'll get my negatives out of the way (This part may seem overly nitpicky. All in all, they're more minor annoyances):

WARNING! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!

--The cheesiness. Oh, good grief. The show isn't painfully cheesy, but some of the dialogue is enough to make you want to bash your head against the wall. Snow and Charming (aka Mary Margaret and David) pretty much recite the same drivel every week: ""I love you, but we can never be together. Something will always stand in our way."" (But the actors portraying thouse characters do a good job with what their given, so it's not their fault.) And let's not forget their infamous ""I will always find you."" (""And IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII will always find yooooooooooouuuuu!"") Other character seem to suffer from semi-cliche dialogue, such as Henry's giant speech at the end of the second-to-last episode and August while trying to convince Emma the curse is real. The first few episodes are the worst offenders in terms of cheesiness, but later episodes don't seem to suffer from this as much. It's not terrible, but I'll admit, a few lines were giggle-worthy.

--Some graphics/costuming: I kind of merged these, even though they're not really related. Mostly because my main beef is with the fairies, who are a mix of graphics and costumes. I'm sorry, but who thought the radioactive Skittle look would be okay? They all glowed like Christmas lights. And the jellyfish dresses? Not happening for me. The dragon in the finale wasn't horrible and actually didn't look too bad for a TV show. I mean, I wasn't expected Harry Potter here. But it did look semi-generic and I wasn't a huge fan of the glowing green eyes. I'm not sure where this particular nitpick fits, but I'll just say it's kind of a costuming fail: Rumpelstiltskin's sweaty-sparkly-gold look as he turns into ""The Dark One."" It looked sort of silly, more like Gollum having too much fun with glitter glue.

--Forgotten characters: In a show that's a little more complex, with lots of characters that get introduced, it would be hard to fit them into every single episode. But characters like Cinderella (who didn't get as much screen time as I expected) and Hansel and Gretel show up for one episode (although I think Cinderella had a minor part in a couple more episodes), then slide into the abyss of forgotten characters. I wish they had done more of a Red Riding Hood situation with these characters (as in, they appear in more than one episode, but are still secondary.)

--Emma: Now, I'm torn about her. She's an interesting character and not a character I full-on despise. But she comes across as a little too brash and harsh. It makes sense considering her lifestyle (orphan, grew up to  be a bail bond agent.) But I wish they had softened her character more. We get a little bit of softness when she's with Henry, but with anyone else (ESPECIALLY Graham and August) she acts sort of witchy.

Now for the good:

--Interesting new takes on fairy tales: These aren't your grandma's fairy tale. You see, in these fairy tales, the Queen has an excuse for hating Snow White. Snow White is more than a wuss who stupidly eats an apple that knocks her out. Charming gets some personality and isn't just sexiness personified. My favorite fairy tale retellings on the show have to be Red Riding Hood, where the wolf's identity proves to be surprising, and Beauty and the Beast, where Rumpelstiltskin replaces the Beast as Belle's lover.

--Interesting villains: Because if there's one thing lots of TV shows and books lack, it's interesting villains. Regina is evil. You don't really doubt that when you watch the show. You know she's the bad guy. But at the same time, she's not 100% pure evil, spawn of the devil. Her backstory helps us understand why she is the way she is and helps us even, surprisingly, feel sympathy. Rumpelstiltskin is also interesting. He doesn't always seem as bad as Regina. He likes to play on both good and bad sides. He just wants to please himself. Even he gets a backstory that makes you sympathize with him. He turned evil because he wanted to protect his son. (I do have to nitpick on him though. Am I the only one who thinks that he kind of looks like a pedophile around Belle? Minor complaint, since she was hardly on the show this season, but still.)

--Interesting protagonists/secondary characters: Like I said before, these fairy tale characters actually get depth. Snow White isn't a wimpy damsel-in-distress, she will KICK YOUR BUTT, although her real-world counterpart, Mary Margaret probably wouldn't. Charming gets a personality, although he's kind of overdramatic at times and his counterpart, David, needs to grow a pair. I really like August/Pinocchio. His backstory was interesting and I'd l ike to see more of him. I love Red Riding Hood/Ruby. She has a very, very interesting fairy tale life and her real-world counterpart, Ruby, is always fun to watch in her typical-teenager-ness (the scene where she tried flirting with August was amusing.)

Overall, OUAT is a great new show, with a few flaws, but still enjoyable. It might not be for everyone, but I would definitely recommend it.",1347840000,5,5510,4.800632911392405
4608923,5,B0058YPL66,"This show has all the suspense, drama and adventure that we all learned from our childhood stories. This is my new addiction. I love it & can't wait for season 2!",1347840000,,162,4.258064516129032
4608924,5,B0058YPL66,"From a somewhat literary snob (if it was a book, it shouldn't be a movie), I fell in love with this from the pilot.  NOT a Lost fan, but these writers, probably with the help of some research assistants, have provided us with sequels/prequels to most of the well-known fairy tales, and a number of the obscure.  And while it seems as if the whole thing centers around Snow White, this goes much deeper.  There isn't any ""glossing over"" the gritty parts, they stay fairly true to the original tales in terms of starting point, and they take off from there.  This is the Love Child of Twin Peaks and Northern Exposure - without the Log Lady.  Can't wait for the second season!!!",1347494400,,676,4.463414634146342
4608925,4,B0058YPL66,"How could a show that takes the princesses and characters from every fairy tale known to modern man and woman not be a sensation? That's my question to anyone who challenges the success of ABC's ""Once Upon A Time."" You're guaranteed to have a hit show when it appeals to any female on Earth old enough to watch ""Cinderella"" or ""Beauty and the Beast.""

ABC Studios released ""Once Upon A Time: The Complete First Season,"" giving people who have a hard time keeping up with television program schedules a chance to take in the series at their own pace. It won't take but one or two episodes to get a viewer hooked. They'll soon find themselves zooming through the episodes one after the next in anticipation.

A boy named Henry (Jared Gilmore) shows up on Emma Swan's (Jennifer Morrison) doorstep. He claims to be the son she gave up for adoption ten years earlier. Henry shares a theory with her as she drives him home to the little town of Storybrooke, Maine. He believes all the citizens of Storybrooke are fairy tale characters living under a curse his adopted mother and mayor of the town, Regina (Lana Parrilla), put them under. Henry is certain Regina is the wicked witch from the story of ""Snow White."" The boy believes Emma is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas) and she is destined to lift the curse Regina put on the town.

It's amazing how well writers for this show mash together all the fairy tales we grew up reading, hearing, and seeing. It's a complex storyline that interweaves so many mythical characters you literally just sit there at times wondering who or what is going to show up next. It truly is a soap opera for fairy tale lovers.

Being a comic book fan, I can't help but bring up the similarities ""Once Upon A Time"" has to Bill Willingham's graphic novel series ""Fables."" The book has been around since 2002 and ABC even optioned the comic at one point to develop it for television. It's hard to believe years later they just happened to come up with a similar concept.

Producers claim they hadn't read any of the issues before they created the show. Strangely, the series has issues of Marvel Comics lying around different scenes as if they're taking shots at DC and Vertigo Comics who published ""Fables."" DC and Marvel are known to be competitors in the comic book world.

Consumers and fans of the show will be happy with the bonus material found on the Blu-ray release of the series. There are several featurettes including ""'Once Upon A Time:' Origins,"" ""Fairy Tales in the Modern World,"" ""Building Character,"" ""Welcome to Storybrooke,"" and ""The Story I Remember... 'Snow White.'"" Other extras found are ""Fairest Bloopers of Them All,"" audio commentaries, and deleted scenes.

The Blu-ray version of ""Once Upon A Time"" contains all 22 episodes of the series on five discs. The special features are spread throughout the discs. I recommend this for any fairy tale buffs and even enthusiasts of the dark fantasy and horror genres.",1347494400,2,2985,4.706896551724138
4608926,5,B0058YPL66,"I've only watched eight of the 22 episodes but ""Once Upon A Time"" is my new favorite show! The stories are interesting and full of intrigue but not confusing or frustrating! It's fun to find all the nods to the Disney fairy tales and I love the way the series flows between the fairy tale world and modern day.  If you like fairy tales and haven't found anything to keep you tuning in since ""Lost,"" you'll love ""Once Upon A Time!""",1347321600,,430,4.308641975308642
4608927,5,B0058YPL66,"I found myself addicted to this creative twist on the familiar fairy tale. ""Once Upon A Time"" takes some of the most famous characters known to most of us through their Disney version (Snow White, Prince Charming, Cinderella, Pinocchio, The Mad Hatter, and Belle) as well as some that haven't been Disney-fied yet (Rumpelstiltskin, Hansel and Gretel, and Little Red Riding Hood) and puts them all together in modern times in a town called Storybrooke. None of the Storybrooke citizens remember their fairy tale origins (which are seen in flashback sequences), except for the Evil Queen from ""Snow White,"" who runs the town as Mayor. It was she who engineered their memory loss and move to Storybrooke, so that she could remove all happiness from their lives out of her vengeance for a slight from Snow herself. It is the Evil Queen/Mayor's adopted son who figures it all out by reading a book of fairy tales. He makes the link between the Enchanted World and that of Storybrooke, and enlists the help of his birth mother, who he believes to be the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. If it sounds a little convoluted, well...at times it can be. Yet with each episode, I found myself drawn further and further in as each character becomes linked and intertwined, drawing towards the season's breathtaking finale...which only leaves the viewer with more questions that will have to wait until the second season.

The cast is stellar. Lana Parrilla shines as the Evil Queen/Mayor, rising to the occasion of being the villainess you want to hate, but also giving her just enough touches of humanity to make you sympathize (just a little bit!) with her and feel the pain that created the vengeful creature she became. Note: without giving away any plot twists, Barbara Hershey has a fantastic cameo as The Evil Queen's mother...talk about chilling! Ginnifer Goodwin is letter perfect as Snow White, but even more perfect in her characterization of the teacher in Storybrooke. Conflicted by the hate of the Mayor, she struggles with choices that seem a little unlike her fairy-tale counterpart. This is what makes this series so fun; perfect characters become imperfect in our present world, and it can be difficult to predict what they will do. Jennifer Morrison was an excellent choice as Snow White's Daughter, aka Emma Swan of Storybrooke. I do have a bone to pick with the writers though, who flip flop her Storybrooke character from being a tough and determined mother to being a wimpy whiny mess who wants to run away. This flopping of character only serves to draw out the drama, and not in a good way. No such problem with Robert Carlyle's characters of Rumpelstiltskin/Mr. Gold. He goes head to head with Parrilla, serving up a performance that you love to hate, but at the same time also sympathize with.

The special effects are top notch; when looking at the extras, it is hard to believe just how much of the sets were done in CGI. I doubt that this series could have been done on a television budget ten years ago. On blu-ray, the visuals and sound are spectacular. Great detail, clarity, and color.  Aspect ration is 1.78:1, with the sound in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround.

The extras on the DVD/Blu-ray include the following featurettes:

* Fairy Tales in the Modern World: How the classic stories we all know and love were adapted to coexist with Storybrooke.
* Building Character: Using Belle (from ""Beauty and the Beast"") as the example, it shows how the production team re-created her character for ""Once Upon A Time,"" using just enough visual queues from the Disney version to make her recognizable, but adding a few new twists to make her fresh. Actress Emilie de Ravin's input was also taken, which you can see in her interview when she was asked to give her thoughts on Belle.
* Welcome to Storybrooke: This was one of my favorites, showing how the town in Canada used for Storybrooke was transformed each time it had to be used for filming. The production crew had the changeover down to a science, as they took existing stores and restaurants and made them the ones that you see on screen. I'm sure this will bump up the tourism, as visitors have already asked when will Mr. Gold's Antique shop be open!
* The Story I Remember...Snow White: Interesting to hear the different actors in the show describe the version of Snow White that they are familiar with (note: there  exist many more versions besides the Disney one). Some darker than others!

The usual commentaries (including co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, writer Jane Epenson, and cast members Goodwin, Carlyle, Parilla, Morrison and Josh Dallas, aka Prince Charming), bloopers and deleted scenes are included, too. Some of the deleted scenes added a little extra information (especially revolving around the plot of Snow being in jail), but in the end, nothing that really was missed. For the sake of pacing, the deletions were correct.

Found on the Blu-ray (but not DVD) is:

*Once Upon A Time: Origins: Dallas guides viewers through the various fairy tales represented in ""Once Upon A Time,"" discussing the history beginning back to when they were first told/written right up to the Disney versions. Obviously, some have been changed more than others. Very interesting to see the differences.

This set is highly recommended, but I warn you...it will be difficult to put down once you start watching!",1347235200,3,5401,4.860869565217391

The CGI is great for a low budget series show, come on folks this isn't a 50 million dollar show.  Sure there were a few characters that needed a little more development and I couldn't get enough of Mr Gold and Regina together. I also hated loosing two of my most favorite characters and hope with the magic that has been unleashed they may return.  HERE'S HOPING!!  I have never reviewed a show, this is my first and tell you its so worth the money if you haven't seen it.  If you are a fan of fantasy, fairy tales, and the whole good vs evil ONCE UPON A TIME is a great investment.  I promise you will watch these dvd's over and over again and again.  I LOVE IT!!

Ever since I was a little girl, I have always had an interest in fairy tales. Once Upon a Time is a show about fairy tales with a bit of a twist. I like how the show takes place in the modern world, but there are flash backs of the fairy tale world and what happened before the curse. It seems like all magic comes with a price...a steep price in most if not all cases. I am finding that I enjoy watching the fairy tale stories, more than I am the stories in the current world on the show. I cannot wait for the second season to begin.",1346976000,,679,4.0

4608982,3,B0058YPL66,"""Once Upon a Time"" is ABC's latest stunt to stay afloat in a post-LOST era of television and for the most part they manage to succeed. Like ""30 Days of Night (2007)"" was a return to the 'vicious vampire' before the genre crashed and burned in 2008 with the ""Twilight"" pandemic, the years 2011 and 2012 have been rather lucrative time for the homogeneously white revisionist fairy tales (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cinder/dp/0312641893/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cinder</a>"" being the only real exception to the rule, but only just). Cinderella, Snow White and fairy tales in general continue to be appealing icons to try and revise as a result of how they've been permeated into the public conscious by the Walt Disney Company and for simply being the fast-food snack for feminist critique, but does this show do anything to bring them into a ""better light""?

Well, kinda.

The idea of stranding fairy tale characters in what is known as our miserable reality (the real world) is nothing new. If you've seen ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-10th-Kingdom/dp/B0000648XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 10th Kingdom</a>"", or heck, watched Linda Hamilton in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-the-Beast/dp/B000K7UBX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and the Beast</a>"", then you've seen the concept of ""Once Upon a Time"". It's a modern twist on the Disney Fairy Tale trope or what the fairy tale means to people because of the aforementioned commercialization of oral tradition. The biggest advantage this series has over the aforementioned shows is the passage of time and a slightly different mindset toward ""Girl Power"" and the working woman. The concept of romance, however, remains blissfully stilted as always despite their attempts to equalize gender roles with the ""strong independent woman"" trope immortalized in Emma Swan and Snow White.

[The series' modus operandi is to get the audience to become emotionally connected to bland characters such as Snow White, Prince Ferdinand (forever exiled on island ""Prince Charming"" because no one does their research) and the Evil Queen of the Snow White fairy tale. Utilizing 21st century sensibilities as seen in such films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-White-and-the-Huntsman/dp/B005LAIHSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow White and the Huntsman</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mirror-Mirror/dp/B0086DBE62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mirror Mirror</a>"", Snow White isn't the passive pushover Disney has immortalized her as. Instead she's a [former] princess turned highwayman with a cynical outlook on love (progressive). Prince ""James"" Charming is the poor estranged twin of a dead prince who gets roped into parading as his other half when he's killed via arrogance, and the Evil Queen is no longer an age obsessed woman, but an emotionally seared one looking to get even with the ever-present source of her unhappiness: Snow White. Whoopee.

Together the three create the backbone for the story that begins with the ""dead"" Snow White and the Prince come to her aid. Once awakened from sleeping death, the plot wastes no time in introduce Queen Regina and her plans to make the Prince and Snow White pay for the misery they inflicted upon her. She goes to such lengths as to curse the entirety of the fairy tale land just to get back at them, effectively stranding herself and several other fairy tale characters in the real world without memories of their lives prior.

However, the fairy tale heroes were not without a plan; just before the curse hits the land, Snow White gives birth to a daughter, later named Emma Swan (pause for ""see what we did there?"" effect), and send her through a portal of sorts to the real world, officially electing her their blonde haired and blue eyed messiah of the series who will take them to the promised land.

28 years later, Emma is a bail-bonds-hunter with a particularly jaded outlook on life until she meets a rather pushy little boy named Henry Mills. He claims to be her biological son and requests that she return to Storybooke (pause for ""see what we did there?"" effect x2) in order to save the inhabitants of the town from the ""Evil Queen Regina"" who is the mayor of the affected town. Skeptical, Emma initially goes into town to simply return him to his mother, Regina, but ends up caught up in the events of the town, effectively playing the Scully to Henry's Mulder as the boy fights to free the fairy tale characters from his mother's possessive grasp.]

As I stated before, for the most part, ""Once Upon a Time"" does manage to succeed with their mission statement; it blends the fantasy with the absurdist reality of Storybooke and the fairy tale world, constantly hammering home themes such as abandonment, ""true love"", family and ""reality is the nightmare, fantasy is the real world"". The show has something of a sense of humor about its concept, never taking itself too seriously until somewhere in the middle where it forgets its humor and becomes staunchly self-important and ""deadly serious"" that you gotta chuckle at it. With the blessing of the Walt Disney Corporation at their command, the writers fall back on those adaptations of fairy tales more and more as the series progresses, but putting their own spin on those tales at the same time.

The truest example is the warping of the Disneyfied version of ""Beauty and the Beast"". The Beast is ultimately removed from the tale and replaced with Rumpelstiltskin as the love interest, Belle is portrayed by an actress who couldn't mask her accent to save her life (if she was trying to) and Gaston is turned into a rose. You could hear the fandom cry foul before the episode even aired (delicious). However, somewhere in the middle, you can tell the series was waning from the attempts to maintain its audience's attention. The story is stretched thinner and thinner with clumsy pacing, dragged out subplots and truly never goes anywhere until the final three episodes. Take a hint from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scandal/dp/B007MDB6Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scandal</a>"" and get the point of your story or de-serialize the show, writers.

""Once Upon A time"" goes about delivering its aforementioned themes in such a heavy-handed and clumsy ways that it's hard not to roll your eyes at the screen when characters spout ham-fisted lines that sound like clumsy prose from a bad paperback romance novel, complete with anger-inflected speeches about stolen happiness and love. Snow White and Prince Charming immortalize the romantic dialog, often sounding as though they were characters stolen out of a romantic comedy without the plain-Jane and average-Joe charm of Meg Ryan's cynicism and Tom Hank's monotone magnetism. They're almost always the characters bemoaning and mulling over ""I'LL NEVER FIND THE ONE(tm)"" and bad luck with romance. They even go as far as trying to vilify one female character just to hammer in how ""meant for each other"" Snow White and Prince Charming are.

Emma, Regina and Henry are effectively the mascots for the family drama oriented dialog and thematic element. Emma is commitment-phobe when it comes to getting close to her son who continually pushes for a relationship with her at the same time he shuns Mayor Regina (his adoptive mother) who is rightfully suspicious of the flakey Emma's intentions. It's comparable to how Chris Columbus deliver familial messages in his films ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Home Alone"" --- all its missing is the whimsical hand of John Williams. It's apparent the writers got so caught up in their own idea that no one paused to double check their dialog.

Most characters that aren't the central protagonists/antagonists lend the series the potential of being better than it what tends to present itself as --- as the stories of the minor characters, barring Cinderella, are far more compelling than the stories of the ""Charmings"" vs. Regina vs. Rumpelstiltskin. Dominated largely by character actors, you're never distracted by painfully obvious pretty faces and spotlight, the characters shine through as troubled people and tales of woe that lend them the strength to connect with the audience on an emotional level. Sometimes.

Raphael Sbarge for instance, forever playing the character that gets short charged for whatever reason, is particularly compelling as Jiminy Cricket and Meghan Ory portrays Red Riding Hood in confines of the ever-popular trope of the ""Promiscuous Girl"" with a raging werewolf curse (progressive, the lady is a predator!). The problem is that the series never bothers to focus or flesh these characters out beyond one or two episodes and little face time.

Another problem the series has is shamelessly tying Rumpelstiltskin to almost every major event that dominates the otherwise aimless storyline. For the better part of the series, nothing happened in an episode without the presence of Rumpelstiltskin being mentioned or being the direct cause of it. It gets to the point of caricature, especially once you find out the writers reasoning for this (i.e., how Rumpelstiltskin gets his abilities). I will say, however, Robert Carlyle's performance is what keeps this character's story from falling to pieces as it would in the hands of any other actor. He takes the material and holds it up just above domesticity, distracting you from what is effectively the series' Deus ex machina.

Likewise, Lana Parrilla's performance and portrayal of Regina Mills is another highlight of the series. She is ultimately the character with a strong enough motivation and emotionally backing within the story; you feel for her, even in the face of the manipulative and rotten things she does to almost everyone in the name of vengeance and that is the mark of a strong actress. Everyone else does a mildly serviceable job, that's really all I can say. Ginnifer Goodwin gives the standard awkward performance as Snow White, but is otherwise inoffensive. Josh Dallas and Jennifer Morrison fall on the side of neither offensive nor fantastic, but hardly anything to write home about. The show, acting wise, is literally held up by Parrilla and Carlyle.

The representation of race or non-white peoples in the form of major characters is criminally low; the best the show wants to offer you are the Genie (Giancarlo Esposito) and the Fairy Godmother (Catherine Lough Haggquist) --- both of whom are in servitude of white characters ---- and that's it. One doesn't even survive the beginning of an episode, the other one is barely a character in his own right. His biggest ""character"" trait amounts to nothing but sulking in the shadows of Queen Regina, pining after her in a perpetual state of unrequited love and playing the fall man. Way to go, writers.

The arrival of Sinqua Walls (Sir Lancelot) and Jamie Chung (Mulan) in the second season hardly heralds good news as neither seem to be slated beyond ONE or two episodes and thus the series continues to be a major disappointment on this front. Special effects in the series is glaringly awful; green screened backgrounds rise up off the sets like something you'd see in early eighties or nineties produced shows (blur included) and the sets truly come off as just that. You're never once taken out of the ""I'm looking at set right now"", which was one of the problems with all of the shows under the herald of Joss Whedon. Mark Snow returns to major television (if he ever left) after the cancellation of ""Ghost Whisperer"" to spin a delightfully annoying score full of whimsy and single guitar string plucks; outside of the title themes he composes, his music is one step away from the generic hallmark TV movie score and I'll forever wonder why he continues to get a job.

Overall, ""Once Upon a Time"" isn't a bad attempt to stick it to the archaism of the Disney Fairy Tale and the genre itself, but its execution leaves much to be desired. It's not a bad show, but it hardly rises above average and more often than not it's aggravating watch primarily because of the writing, pacing and the dialog. The best that I could say is that is fun, just plain fun and doesn't amount to much else. [a 3 out of 5].",1346889600,9,12400,5.238790931989924

When I first heard about ""Once Upon A Time"" I was only watching a few TV shows, mostly the ones on Animal Planet, since those seemed to be the only really decent programs on at the time.  Unlike other fans, I didn't watch the pilot, my parents don't have TV channels at their house and the television itself is just for movies and video games.  Instead, I watched the third episode in my dormitory on a weekend I was studying for some tests and needed a break.  Although I didn't see all of the episodes until the last day of 2011, I instantly fell in love with the show.  The writing is excellent, the characters are engaging, the costumes are beautiful, and the show itself doesn't have unnecessary profanity, violence or drama that most TV shows have.

4609025,5,B0058YPL66,"I thought I had seen it all. Each new show that came down the pike had been done to an exhausting level before. Television was stale and I had just about given up and then ""Once Upon a Time"" came out. I would like to say I was hooked from the first episode but I wasn't. I watched the first three, thought they were ok but didn't go back for a number of months. I guess I was too jaded and did not see the brilliance of the show at the onset. The show definitely finds its footing around episode 7 and then takes off with a bullet. I had finally run out of things to watch so I decided to go back and watch them on Amazon and I am so glad I did. I burned through the entire season and am now in the middle of the season again as I watch it with my husband who is also in love with it. I adore how the writers can take fairytale characters we all know and grew up with and give them an adult depth and backstory that one can sink their teeth into. I cannot pick a favorite character but I do have a fondness for Rumplestilskin and the Mad Hatter back stories. I love how each episode weaves two stories simultaneously and leaves enough room to grow these stories over time. I cannot wait to find out who the doctor is for example and I am curious to see what happens with each of these characters next season. This show has a fantastic plot, 3-dimensional characters, a solid foundation for future seasons and a strong fan base. My one and only complaint is that the green screen can be a bit much at times. I can forgive that as I know they are trying to do a huge project on a television show budget. Still one of the most brilliant shows I have seen in years. I thought I would never love a show as much as ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" in my lifetime as I felt those shows were incredible. However, I think that ""Once Upon a Time"" is moving up the ladder fast.

The fun of this show is rooted in both how all those fairy tale characters are fitted into our world (Cinderella as a teen mom, Little Red Riding Hood as a rebellious and vixenish diner waitress, Rumplestilskin as the richest guy in town) but also how those characters came to be with new and interesting twists on their backstories, such as a reworking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-the-Beast/dp/B003DZX3SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and the Beast</a>&nbsp;to give Rumplestilskin more depth of character, or the exact reasons behind the Evil Queen's vendetta against Snow White, why Prince Charming is called ""Prince Charming,"" and even a surprise angle on Little Red Riding Hood you would never have considered.

In the present, all the Fairy Tale characters have with no recollection of their past and, as time has stopped, they don't age. But this changes when Henry, an 11 years old boy who is Snow White grandchild and has been adopted by the Evil Queen, escapes the town and, after finding his mother, Emma Swan, brings her with him back to Storybrook.

Henry learned of the curse in the book his teacher Mary Margaret (Snow White) gave to him. He knows that only Emma, the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, can break the curse. But no one believes his stories. No one but his adoptive mother, the Evil Queen and present day major, who is intent on sending Emma away.

The story sounds complicated and even lame, but it's not. It's a wonderfully crafted story created by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, the writers of ""LOST"". It has the appropriate amount of romance and adventure, and is perfectly cast.

As the teaser on ABC website puts it: ""Brace yourself for a modern fable with thrilling twists and hints of darkness. Brimming with wonder, and filled with the magic of our most beloved fairytales.""
Don't miss it!",1345507200,,1545,4.75
4609069,5,B0058YPL66,"I was a huge fan of Lost when it aired, so when this was promoted as an ""if you like Lost"" show, I knew I had to watch. I also really like fantasy, and love how it's half fairy tale, half real world stories, and how everything merges together.

The cast is great, and all the characters are interesting, though I think they may have introduced too many characters, and they could've left a few of the smaller stories out, and saved them for next season, but that's a minor complaint. I especially love Emile de Ravin, (who is a Lost alumni,) as Belle, though her part this season was small, I can't wait to see her as a regular in season two.

I also can't wait to own this on blu-ray, and rewatch the entire season knowing what happens, since the fairy tale storylines aren't always told in order, and the real world storylines become even more interesting once you know who is really a villain or not, and who knows that they're really fairy tale characters from that start, so it's something that's definatly worth watching more then once, since you'll see things differently the second time.",1345507200,2,1095,4.49748743718593

I love it when they take the stories that we think we know and turn them on their head. I especially applaud the creativity that went into the Little Red Riding Hood retelling.

The casting in this show is smarter and simply perfect. Regina Mills as the Evil Queen should just be handed an Emmy for instance, she oozes evil and Julia Roberts has nothing on her in the role.
  While the adorable Ginnifer Goodwin is easily the best person to play Snow White, she looks the part and just like in the new movies, she doesn't need rescuing and is tough. But I rather stay at home and see her twist on Snow White than rush to the movies to see....Kristen Stewart as Snow White for instance. Robert Carlyle is bit of a show stealer though as Rumple Stilskan ""if I'm spelling it right"", he nails the part even if he is a little over the top with the laugh he does.

4609259,5,B0058YPL66,"Who knew that network television could sustain not one but two programs based on childhood fairy tales?  One of these is the fascinating ""Once Upon a Time"", whose premise is that a collection of story book characters have been cursed and frozen in (modern) time and place (the small Maine town of Storybrooke) and are largely unaware of their real identities.  Into this situation walks bail bondsman Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison from ""House""), who stumbles across the son she gave up for adoption ten years.  The son, Henry, has been adopted by Regina Mills (Lana Parilla from ""Miami Medical""), the Mayor of Storybrooke, who doesn't take kindly to Emma's presence.  It is the knowing Henry who explains to the skeptical Emma that her destiny is to end the curse.

The plot quickly develops into a nasty rivalry between Emma and Regina over the fate of Henry and the town.  Emma is significantly handicapped by her inability to accept the cursed nature of the town and its inhabitants.  The audience has the benefit of flashbacks that explain the amusing and/or scary backstories of the residents.  Regina is of course the Evil Queen who instigated the curse.  Snow White and her Prince Charming are living in the town, but sadly unaware of their relationship or that Emma is their daughter. Pawn shop owner Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) is a devious Rumpelstiltzskin who plays off Emma and Regina against each other for his own purposes.  Little Red Hood and Pinocchio makes surprising appearences as characters, among others.

If the plot can be a little challenging to follow, good acting and a great mixture of humor, drama, and some moral lessons sell the series.  The season finale brings a shocking change to Storybrooke, but viewers will have to watch Season Two to find out what the change means.  ""Once Upon a Time"" is highly recommended to its fans.",1337385600,14,1856,4.872611464968153
4609260,5,B0058YPL66,"Once upon a time ABC created a new ambitious show. They promoted it heavily and used characters we all grew up with.

Who would have thought in the year 2011/2012 we'd all be tuning in with our families to watch the adventures of Snow White, Prince Charming, The Evil Queen, Rumplestltskin and more? Fortunately for ABC and Disney: their idea worked.

The concept seems so simple. The Queen (Lana Parilla) is furious at Snow White (and it's not about looks!). She uses an evil curse and moves every character out of Fairy Tale Land and put them all in a town called Storybrooke in the state of Maine.

A little boy finds out the truth and seeks out to find Snow White's daughter and use her help to break the curse.

There's a lot of good episodes. Only one was meh (The Dreamy episode).

Best episodes include:

1) The Pilot
2) The Thing you love most
3) The heart is a lonely hunter
4) Skin Deep
5) The Stable boy
6) An apple as red as blood
7) A land without magic",1337299200,16,967,4.285714285714286
4609261,5,B0058YPL66,"First of all, if you haven't seen Once Upon a Time, I HIGHLY recommend you see it... right away, asap! I was hooked in the first five minutes of the pilot episode! Sometimes that happens and then the rest of the episodes aren't as good, but with this show, every single episode is excellent. When I try to choose a favorite episode, I find myself naming off half of them.

The characters are very well done, especially Regina/The Evil Queen. It's amazing how you can go from hating her one moment to liking her or feeling sorry for her in the next (You're awesome, Lana Parrilla!). Usually I have a least favorite character, but I really like all of them.

I love how they switch back and forth from the real world to the fantasy world. It may sound like it jumps around, but it doesn't seem like that at all. It's very easy to follow and the scenes between the two worlds are always linked and play an important part in the storyline. I won't go into specifics, but there are some amazing plot twists and surprises along the way. The things the writers think of!

Anyways, 5 stars for Once Upon a Time! I would give it more if I could! I'm really glad it's been renewed for next year and I can't wait to buy it on DVD.",1336953600,18,1219,4.268398268398268
4609262,5,B0058YPL66,"Once Upon a Time is a heady cocktail of fairy tales, children's lit and Disney animated movies.

As it begins, the Evil Queen of Snow White fame makes her bid for revenge by unleashing a spell on all the residents of Once Upon a Time land - including her nemeses Snow White and Prince Charming - which will hurl them into our world sans memories, ergo stripping them of their happiness.  A council of the good guys manage to gum up the works by sending Snow and Charming's literally just born baby daughter Emma through first, making her the only person who can break the curse.

Flash forward to the modern town of Storybrooke, Maine.  Emma is now a young woman who got herself knocked up and, unable to care for her son presumably because of a combination of her young age at the time and the unwillingness of her lover to step up to the plate, had given him up for adoption.  This is something she was at peace with until the boy, Henry, seeks her out with a wild story: he is the adoptive son of Storybrooke's mayor Regina - none other than the Evil Queen herself - and the whole town consists of cursed characters who cannot remember their identities and cannot cross the town border and whom Emma is obligated to save.  Occasionally aided by town residents Mary Margaret (Snow), David (Charming), Archie (Jiminy Cricket), Ruby (Little Red Riding Hood) and Ruby's Grandma, Emma begins to oppose Regina, not quite believing Henry but also not liking what she sees in Regina's behavior and becoming attached to Henry in spite of her intentions.  But the Evil Queen has no intention of letting the curse be lifted, and also in the mix is the perhaps even worse Rumpelstiltskin, who starts racking up favors for purposes of his own...

Can Emma save the residents of Storybrooke, including her unknown parents and the son she thought she wasn't cut out for raising?

Some of the characters are immediately recognizable, but half of the fun is figuring out who alot of the town residents are going to turn out to be - particularly town Sheriff Graham, who deputizes Emma and backs her up, and later on a biker who eventually goes by the name of August and seems to know what's going on.  Many of the backstories turn the traditional views of the characters completely on their heads.  Sometimes it's with clever whimsey, but other times with pitch blackness and in some cases aching tragedy.  The Queen's damage runs deep and far, and there are several stories of couples and relatives torn apart and trying to find their way back to eachother for a happily ever after - even if they don't quite know who they are thanks to the curse.  There are any number of people to root for and get attached to, with some having been played a worse hand than others and many trying to rectify mistakes they've made.  Acting honors almost definitely go to Robert Carlyle, who does a phenomenal job as a Rumpelstiltskin who manages to be sympathetic, creepy, scary and his own worst enemy all at once; but there are nuggets for basically all the main and supporting cast.

It's kind of a relief to watch after all these gritty, sometimes depressing and disturbingly violent shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B003Y5HWMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartacus-Gods-of-the-Arena/dp/B004HW7JMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartacus: Gods of the Arena</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boardwalk-Empire-Blu-ray/dp/B003Y5HWK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boardwalk Empire[Blu-ray</a>].

The format of the show may be difficult to follow, because the fairy tales are told out of sequence, as the parts told in our world happen in order. However, you could probably watch the episodes randomly and still understand what's going on. The premise is that Snow White's stepmother, The Evil Queen, has cursed all of Fairy Tale Land and transported them here, to a Maine town called Storybrooke. (Yes, seriously.) No one remembers who they are except for a select few, and time is at a standstill until The Chosen One arrives. Confusion may come when trying to remember all of the characters' names and/or titles. Regina/the mayor/the evil queen, is one example, but the stories are told in a way that eventually you know who's who.

The show is written by some of the people from Lost, and apparently there are a lot of references to Lost on screen. I never watched Lost, so I can't comment on that. There are also many references to Disney both visually and in the plot, so that's kind of fun to see. Some people say this is family entertainment, but I have to disagree. I would be very uncomfortable explaining some of the plot points to young children. To be fair, the original Grimm tales are pretty grim as well, but this show uses Disney characters as a base. While Disney films have also had many questionable moments, I would not recommend this for the whole family.

For one thing, Prince Charming/David/shepherd guy is married to King Midas' daughter/Princess Abigail/Katherine in this world. (Are you following all this?) He is cheating on her with Mary Margaret/Snow White/Princess Snow. Presented in context, it's understandable and even sympathetic, but they carry it too far. The pregnancy test drama simply piled onto the fact that David/Charming is a big dumb schmuck. In the finale, I was rooting for the dragon to win and for David to leave town.

The worst thing about the show to me is the way adoption is portrayed. The themes seem to be adoptive parents' and children's worst nightmares. Emma is left at an orphanage as a baby and never gets a real family, bouncing around from foster home to foster home. Henry is Regina/mayor/evil queen's adopted son in, and from, this world. He keeps saying his mother is evil, and runs to his birth mother, Emma for help. Henry never shows any attachment to his adoptive mother, and Regina shows little true maternal instinct until the finale. Even then, it's too little too late. This is another thing the writers take too far when Emma threatens to take Henry away from Regina. The genre just isn't right for some of this stuff.

Some religious groups will have a huge problem with nomenclature if they don't already shun the show because of magic. Emma is referred to as ""the savior"" throughout the series, and even begins to refer to herself this way in the finale. These are just a few of the awkward things about OUAT that would make me think twice about letting my kids watch. Your mileage will probably vary. You may not care, you may have mature kids who can handle the content-- I'm just telling you what's in there.

Caveats aside, it's intriguing to watch character fairy tale back stories unfold, always in a way that relates to what is happening here and now. It's hard to understand how some of the events in our world could happen, unless you've heard director commentary on a 5-episode DVD that was available around Easter. They explain that time has kind of ""stopped"" in Storybrooke, which is why you see things that seem to be anachronisms and events that wouldn't seem likely these days. I don't think it's as obvious as they seem to think, at least not to me. As with all stories about time travel and manipulating time, I tend to go a bit cross-eyed. If time has stopped in Storybrooke, how did Henry age 10 years with no one noticing that no one else did? Maybe it's just magic, but sometimes it's hard to suspend disbelief.

The plot is predictable at times, but is otherwise engaging. Regina and Mr. Gold/Rumplestiltkin are worth watching. It's not about police procedurals, doctors or lawyers. This show is very close to what I've been looking for-- something taken down a notch from all these shows that are too clever for their own good, something with characters, story and without the squick. It's something different and in my stomping grounds. I just wish the writers would stomp David/Charming into somebody that I could like. He's too dumb to win or live. In a game of thrones, he'd already be dead.",1336953600,18,6208,5.844370860927152
4609266,5,B0058YPL66,"I saw the pilon thinking it would be more of a childish dreamy series, and it turned out to be a one very well though series with twists and turns and a more Brother's Grim view than Disney wich makes it even better!

And it takes it to a different level too meaning that you get to see how the characters all interact with one another within the fairy tales (whose friends, whose not) and personal view points of the characters. I have LOVED this show since the beginning episode and I will continue to be a faithful Storybrooke follower until that fateful day when we hear Series finale.

I very happily added Once Upon a Time to the list this year.  Very skillfully written, especially in terms of transversing the fairy tale world and the ""real world"" Storybrooke.  And I appreciate the way the writers fractured a few fairy tales in the interest of advancing certain plot lines.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I think the characters are rich and multi-dimensional.  Some of the most interesting aspects of the show are found it its dark undercurrents/themes.  It might be an 8:00 show, but it is definitely an 8:00 show with an edge.

The acting is top-notch.  Robert Carlyle will always be a favorite, but all of the actors are spot on for their characters.  It has been a great first season and I look forward to Sunday's finale with mixed feelings.

Robert Carlyle is very very always on time with his acting. He brings Rumplestiltskin to live in this new magical out come of our favorite disney characters and many other fairytales that lurk within a vault.

The whole show is based around character building, which if you like to read, it's really not a problem. The beginning sets up everything. After that, the pace picks up and every episode has you at the edge of your seat at one point. The characters are fantastic, the acting and story line is amazing, and the twists have you talking about the series nonstop until the next episode. The series is great for anyone over 10. So for the most part the whole family can watch. The only reason I say over 10 is there is a lot of talking and some dark moments among the characers.

I like ONCE a lot, but the pacing can feel slow and usually any story not involving Snow White is boring, BUT Rumpelstiltskin is always a highlight. With him featured center stage in the retelling of Beauty and the Beast, it has everything I tune in to this show for - romance, unique takes on classic tales, and interesting characters.

The princes and most of the princess always seem so bland, so I can't help but love the nuanced Rumpelstiltskin.

I was growing tired of Prince Charming cheating on his wife, Emma and the Queen having cat fights at every turn, and the plot NEVER moving forward, so I feared this show had almost run its course and then THIS EPISODE happens and I'm totally back on board.

Nicely done, but it's written by jane espenson, who I just discovered wrote half of all the television I like, so I shouldn't be surprised.

Episodes 6 and 7 are good too, but there needs to be more like ep 12!

I watched them all air, but this is the only ep I've bought. I can't stop thinking about it!",1329523200,5,1077,4.355

The first thing I aquired (after a couple of books) is a Season Pass to Once Upon A Time, having been hooked on this show since it started! I adore Amazon Instant Video and the fact I can download eps and store them or just watch them online. Admittedly, I generally watch on my PC because the screen is bigger. I'll be coveting one of those TV's on Amazon's ""Watch on your TV"" list too...

As for this show - the stories are intriguing with creative twists on the (hopefully still) well known Grimm Fairy Tales. The character development is superb and the acting fantastic - Robert Carlyle is brilliant as Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold (yeah, I'm a member of Team Rumple - whadda ya gonna do?). That's not to say the other actors are not terrific too. Lana Parrilla as Evil Queen/Regina is over-the-top great and Jennifer Morrison plays Emma Swan wonderfully. Jared Gilmore who plays the 10 year old Henry is great too....as are all the other actors (Ruby ROCKS!).

I haven't liked a show this much since the X-Files (before it jumped the shark). Speaking of coincidences.... Gillian Anderson (Scully in TXF) and Robert Carlyle were in a movie together:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mighty-Celt-The/dp/B00197YZCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mighty Celt, The</a>.

What is great about this show, is that the story can't be great, but the true is that it is very engaging, but the casting was excellent. They couldn't choose better actors for this show. I love Snow White new twist, from fragile damsel in distress to lady Robin Hood at times. Of course what else to expect from a run away girl that is living now in the forest with 7 strangers, delightful. And Rumpelstiltskin, the actor is amazing, just he alone make the show worth watching for me.)

I am revising my review and my ratings  as I watch the show, I still like the show, but damn what is going on with the female good characters in this show, are they that naive. They just let everybody tell them what to do and walk all over them, no character at all, it feels like a cheap soap-opera sometimes. The Sheriff, Snow white, and all the others ladies are just a bunch of weak female characters. I am admiring the Mayor over the others. It is getting a little bit masochistic, really.

Update: My review for now is a 3.5, I totally love the history of Red Ridding Hood and the last episode was also really good. So I feel a little bit more satisfy with the female characters, they were starting to annoy me with their lack of decision. In the other hand, Charming well... oahh.. he is not really the guy to look for when you are in trouble, the Genie seems to show more blind passion and love to the Mayor/Evil Queen, before and after the events that change them all than what Charming does for Snow, but it is how he is been play.

4609651,4,B0058YPL66,"This is another show that has a great potential, but could end up being poorly executed. After the pilot I was very excited, but starting to see cracks a little already. Granted, there have only been a few episodes, so hopefully I have nothing to worry about.

The idea is great. We all grew up reading and loving fairytales. They are what built our imagination and made everything exciting. And of course there is always ""Happily Ever After"" at the end. As we grow up we realize that ""happily ever after"" is up for interpretation. So putting the world of the fairytales opposite real life as an ""Unhappily ever after"" - spell cast by the Evil Queen is very cool. There is endless potential for so many characters, cool stories and sub-plots.

I don't want to give too much of the story away by detailing all that has happened so far, so I will not. The main characters are introduced from the start in both worlds: Snow White; Prince Charming; Evil Queen and Emma (added twist who is the only one who can break the spell).  There are of course many others that are presented in both worlds in a very cool way. The cast is very notable - G. Goodwin; J. Morrison, L. Parrilla, R. Carlyle to name a few.  The only concern I have as of the last episode is the development of the story. It is moving a little too fast to have a proper impact. Only a small child in a real world is aware of the connection between the two worlds and the only way to break a spell is to ""remind"" all adults who they really are,  Emma being the most important. As difficult of a task as this should be (making adults believe in fairytales), it seems to be not so. By the 3rd episode all important people are already convinced, or at least considering the possibility. This made it seem too accelerated in my opinion.

I just hope that this part is secondary and acts as a set up for the main story, which I think will be the battle between Good and Evil in both worlds.",1320883200,2,1945,4.315068493150685

Yes their is a twist on the classic fairy tale but that is what makes the show. Stardust Anyone? This is yet another original story line that we should be praising somebody for coming up with. I don't know about the rest of you but I hate the American Idols and Dancing with the starts, and don't even get me going about us having to steal somebody else's creative story becuase we can't write a new original story line. Give me more shows like this any day.",1320796800,5,621,4.271186440677966
4609653,3,B0058YPL66,"I happened on Once Upon a Time by accident and the first two episodes had already aired. Once I watched the show I was certain of two things: This is a different take on fairy tales and someone needs to ramp up the acting.

The biggest problem with putting across a show based on fairy tales is that the actors must be fully invested in the story and believe they are the characters they portray. Most of the acting is flat and uninspired and the actors' tongues are too prominent in their cheeks. Snow Falls came closer to what this show could be and I think that was because the actors have had a little more time in their parts.

Snow Falls is a very different take on the Disney version of what happened to Snow White after the huntsman let her go and took a hart's heart back to the Evil Queen, and I don't remember reading in any version of the fairy tale that Snow White turned thief and terrorized the rich to keep for herself. That was unexpected and quite delightful. For the first time, I believed Snow White AKA Mary Margaret and that bodes well for the rest of the show.

Emma is not nearly as surprising and tends to be flat and ho-hum about her part, even when cutting down the Mayor's apple tree. I wanted to see glee and a healthy shot of ""I can hurt you, too,"" coming from her and it just wasn't there. The most exciting part (a previous episode) was the long shot of the tree being cut.

On the whole, the show is new and the actors not all that well known, which could play in their favor. Except for Rumpelstiltskin, who is devlishly demonic and gleeful, if not a little mad, the rest of the cast has a lot of work to do. Snow Falls was a step in the right direction and Snow White/Mary Margaret took the lead. Here's hoping the rest of the cast can muster their tongues out of their cheeks and get down to business with zest and zeal. I have my fingers crossed.",1320796800,,1883,4.222222222222222

4609656,3,B0058YPL66,"The first episode of this show hooked me, but with the second... well,
now we're stuck somewhere down in the weeds between Desperate Housewives
and a somewhat decent made for TV SyFy channel movie (yes, they exist).
I found myself doing other things whenever the plot shifted to Maine.
It was just too melodramatic without any good reason to endure, both
for me and for the lead actress. Why stay in this town where everyone
is trying to get rid of you? For a kid you just met a few days ago who
might be your son, or might be just nuts? After last week I
figured at least she'd opt for a paternity test but as this show
progressed it just made less and less sense why she would endure this
at all, certainly not without a more compelling reason than a runaway's
fairy tale. She's a bail bondsman with inside knowledge of the legal
network and she has yet to even crack a computer to Google
this town, or try any outside research at all for that matter.

Even in the fantasy realm it was a little thick. When a group
brainstorm session of the dark side Elrond Council of Twelve meets to
discuss evil payback and the key focus is trying to talk the queen out
of it... suddenly they seem more slightly miffed rather than evil. And
they can't avoid a moving tree? These guys aren't that tough, or evil,
or even smart. They do ham up their lines to a fault though.

There were moments, to be sure. Rumplestiltskin on either side is
entertaining. The set-up between he and the queen was good. The sheriff
continues to interest me. If only there were some logic thrown in here
to tie it together somehow. It's like two shows, one entertaining enough
to watch on a Saturday afternoon, the other completely boring. They've
planted a great seed but just aren't cultivating it properly yet.",1320278400,3,1780,4.440366972477064

ABC has yet another hit on their hands (Revenge being the other hit; shame they don't think the same way about Charlie's Angels, which is produced by Leonard Goldberg, who produced the original series, which ironically, aired on ABC). The opening minutes just pull you right in and it never lets up from there. Adventure, suspense, magic, true love, the hope that dreams can come true. What more could one ask? At first, it gets a bit confusing keeping track of all the characters (ie. who's who in the fantasy realm and in the real world), but towards the end of the episode, it all clicks.
