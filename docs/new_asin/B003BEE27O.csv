8393544,1,B003BEE27O,Bought this because my b/f likes 30 for 30 movies and fantasy sports. This movie was boring and pointless. I would not recommend this film.,1294704000,2,139,4.6
8393545,5,B003BEE27O,"Controversy be gone! This superlative film should put an end to all the arguments surrounding the advent of Fantasy Sports and we learn quickly that it took the mind of an admitted ""serial obsessive"" to make it come to fruition. Dan Okrent is the whimsical, acknowledged vanguard of what was then called Rotisserie Baseball and in this ESPN 30 for 30 special, we see not only His Majesty Okrent but the other ""losers"" along side of him as the history of ""Roto-Baseball"" is presented. This is an amazingly fun film, fraught with the kind of good natured cynicism that begat this monolithic industry along with a true insight into how friendships expand and how eternal memories are made.

Many of the original players are interviewed here and we get a full and fun understanding of how all this started...from Okrent's opening on how he got this idea after ""missing"" baseball in the winter of 1979 and, with seeming Divine Providence, presenting it to a bunch of baseball crazy pals who also opine on the origins. Of course, the others have a different recollection of how it started ""I'm sure Dan will tell you that he came to the table at La Rotisserie (the restaurant where they all met for periodic lunches that's now defunct) with this Immaculate Conception and that it sprang forth from his rib...I don't remember it that way"" says Lee Eisenberg, who nonetheless rolls right into the crazy, self deprecating jargon that is in abundance in this film, while indirectly acknowledging Okrent's creation.

We meet the first season's winners, the GethersWag Goners, where Peter Gethers and Glen Waggoner get ""damn lucky"" by drafting a nondescript relief pitcher of the Mets (Neil Allen) who goes on to have a career season, propelling them to the top of the new league. Valerie Salembier, who drafted players for ""how they looked, whether they had blue eyes or brown"" and by ""what they had in the back"", Rob Fleder, a writer who is now the last of the originals to play the original game and who's wife is interviewed with bitter diatribe ""these idiots were serious writers who pretended to own a baseball team!"", and Bruce McCall, possibly the funniest and irreverent player who apparently had lesser knowledge of baseball than the others, but who nonetheless contributed to the legend by penning a weekly ""Roto News-Letter"" whereby all Roto players were scrutinized and personality quirks were eponymously exposed.

All kidding aside, this film is very useful for understanding how the fantasy sports business has now morphed into a multi-billion dollar enterprise and we see how the game went from paper and pencils to having the internet give ""retro-rockets"" to its ultimate popularity. To his credit, Okrent discusses how he's content now to be known solely as the ""inventor"" and not obsessed with not having earned millions of dollars...""we started this to have fun...and we had fun!""

As such, this film should be viewed as fun.",1277942400,3,2934,4.933198380566802
8393546,1,B003BEE27O,"Without a doubt the worst of Boo-Yah's 30 for 30. Just stupid. Avoid this one like you would a conversation with Mike Tirico. What was the point of this? Do a doc on Keyshawn John or that Colombian soccer guy that got shot dead after the own goal in the 1994 World Cup.
This was bad...avoid.",1276905600,3,291,4.214285714285714
8393547,3,B003BEE27O,"...but totally untrue, contrived BS that proves once and for all that if something happens west of the Hudson River, it never happened at all. My league started in Hayward, CA, in 1971, eight years earlier. Same essential format, also included media people and it lived for 30 years until my eyes gave out and the agate got to be too much for me. That was before the online version, which appears to me to have taken the fun out of the compiling. Encountered the same frustration that there was no way to make anything out of it after leagues sprung up all over. However, the gist of the 30-for-30 piece captures the pure insanity of playing a game where your chess pieces do the fighting and your brain is corollary to the whole thing. Glad somebody did the documentary. It was fun. I just wish they'd researched it a little more thoroughly.",1276473600,,842,4.509803921568627
