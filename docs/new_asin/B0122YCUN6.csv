8725243,3,B0122YCUN6,"Movie is ok. I thought the movie would be one long story line but since it's three hours long it has a couple different story lines. One story will end with the ""I love you"" song then it jumps right into a new story line with different kids/actors. Since the movie is so long it would be a great road trip DVD. But since it is so long I wish there was an option to select what story line or chapter you want to go to instead of always having to play it from the beginning and fast forward from where you left off. My son and I have watched plenty of Barney movies and this isn't my favorite or my son's favorite Barney DVD. I wouldn't buy this for a Barney lover.",1444694400,,663,3.992481203007519
