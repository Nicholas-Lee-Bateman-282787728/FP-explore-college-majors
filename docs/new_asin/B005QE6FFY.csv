8483291,1,B005QE6FFY,"This is an awful copy. I could easily do a better job of creating a DVD at home from any source of this movie. I see it's no longer available from Amazon and that's good. Even the illustration on Amazon is misleading. That image you see is small 2 1/2 x 3 1/4 postage stamp sized image on the front of the crudely made DVD cover supposedly from ""Loving The Classics"".",1386374400,6,367,4.183098591549296
8483292,1,B005QE6FFY,"This movie and the other movie in this series "" Our hearts were growing up"" is a pirated movie. These movies were taped off of Showtime and AMC and sold here on Amazon. The quality is not good. There are places in the dvd where it needs to be tracked. That's right just like on old VHS tapes. I love the movies but not under these circumstances.",1374537600,11,345,4.164179104477612
8483293,5,B005QE6FFY,"I love old movies, and this is a great one. Adapted from the book, it's funny and sweet,  It's a must see.",1368489600,5,106,3.8181818181818183
