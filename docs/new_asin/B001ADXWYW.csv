3447535,5,B001ADXWYW,"I just saw that Desiree had a new DVD out -- it is even better than the other one that i bought. I am trying to find out if she has more coming. If anyone knows, please leave a comment because I love having a variety.

I do yoga 4 days per week now.",1219708800,5,249,3.611111111111111
3447536,5,B001ADXWYW,"Best Yoga Video I have seen - Beginner or Intermediate
Excellent Instructor and outstanding sound & video quality with subtitles in English or Spanish if selected
Just ordered another DVD by Desiree Bartlett also known as ""Desi"" in her other DVDs....",1404086400,,250,5.121951219512195
3447537,5,B001ADXWYW,"I really enjoyed Desi's yoga workouts. I prefer, and really enjoy the Solar Practice. The Lunar practice was good as well, but I find the solar a little more challenging. Desi has a calming relaxing voice and she offers variations for different levels so you don't feel as though any of the moves are impossible.",1403827200,,312,4.6909090909090905
3447538,5,B001ADXWYW,A challenging dvd for beginners but still doable & very enjoyable. You don't need any straps or blocks though I do recommend a good yoga mat (helps stop slipping & makes floor poses much more comfortable). Desi gives great instructions that are clear to understand & the dvd is beautifully made. I can see myself using it for many years to come since it has a good range of easy & challenging poses in both routines. I bought it to help manage my fibromyalgia & am impressed with the positive health outcomes I am experiencing. If you're new to yoga this is a great place to start.,1401753600,2,581,4.4392523364485985
3447539,5,B001ADXWYW,"Desiree Bartlett is a great instructor.  The pace is just right for beginners and the poses are not too difficult.  For most poses, she provides alternative suggestions to aid the participant in case he/she is not able to fully execute the pose.

The poses are challenging yet not too difficult.  Those who are experiencing difficulty can use the modified poses that Desiree suggests until they are ready to do the full pose(s).

This DVD was also very fairly priced.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for an introduction to Yoga.  Great product and I would buy another one of Desiree's DVDs.",1389916800,,601,4.833333333333333
3447540,5,B001ADXWYW,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It came on time and was in great condition. I can say we are both loving this video! It is perfect for beginners and the two routines will leave you feeling energized, calm and refreshed. The solar routine is good for the morning and I like the Lunar one at the end of the day and sometimes do both. I'm already feeling more limber and it's helping me be more active! Desi has a very calming voice and is a great instructor! I would buy more of her  yoga instructional DVD's anytime.",1388188800,,528,4.28
3447541,1,B001ADXWYW,"Not a begginers video. She doesnt explain (at least in spanish) the transitions. You have to keep looking at the video, so... Are you doing yoga or watching a video?",1386633600,,165,4.533333333333333
3447542,5,B001ADXWYW,I really enjoy the yoga DVD it is easy to follow and not overwhelming. There are two routines and they are short which I like. It gives me a quick way to relax my mind and stretch my body.,1377907200,,188,3.8461538461538463
3447543,5,B001ADXWYW,"I can get down with this DVD.  I try to do it twice a week, and found some poses that I thought would be impossible for someone my size, and I can do it!",1376611200,,153,3.5
3447544,5,B001ADXWYW,"I have several yoga work DVD's but this is my favorite. This is actually my 2nd purchase of this video, as I wore out the 1st one. It is calming and relaxing. This is not a difficult or challenging workout (at least not for me) but I love to do it as a cool down and stretch after biking. I also like it on the days when I am looking for a little easier workout some days. This is definitely a good starting place for beginners just looking to start yoga, but I still enjoy it at least 3 times p/week :)",1366675200,2,503,3.9411764705882355
3447545,5,B001ADXWYW,"This DVD has two 30-minute yoga workouts, a solar (morning) workout and lunar (evening) wokrout.  Desi's yoga is great and the DVD is very artistically done.",1366329600,,157,5.038461538461538
3447546,5,B001ADXWYW,This video is what introduced me to and made me fall in love with yoga.  I worked up such a sweat and saw great results after mastering this. . Absolutely the best beginners yoga routine hands down.,1361318400,,198,4.351351351351352
3447547,5,B001ADXWYW,I absolutely love this DVD.  It has made me a believer in Yoga.  I really like the workouts and the results I am getting.  A great way to get into Yoga.,1357257600,,152,3.838709677419355
3447548,5,B001ADXWYW,"I'm an advanced exerciser but not so much with Yoga. For years I thought Yoga was just a waste of time and I would rather spend it with weights and cardio. However, a recent back injury forced me to give it a closer look. In the past, I had tried misc. Yoga videos but not really connected with any of them until I came upon this one. This DVD is perfect and exactly what I was looking for. It has two workouts (solar and lunar) with the perfect pace, instruction and difficulty which is beyond beginners. It does a great job building and explaining the mind/body awareness that I was always struggling with while at the same time providing a smooth and doable yoga flow. At the end of each 25 minute workout you feel inspired and great. It is truly amazing. I have tried other workouts with Desi and not liked them too much, but she nailed this one. The cueing is as voice-over that I normally don't care for, but here it just fits. Love it!",1345766400,2,942,4.297752808988764
3447549,5,B001ADXWYW,I have always thought to myself Yoga is for women. I'm a man I must lift Heavy weight and I must be strong and not do girly exercises. Well what a mistake. Desi makes it easy to follow in this DVD as you need to sort of watch the TV as you do it and she does it well (no punt intended). After a couple times of doing the workout I found myself able to just follow along without looking and at a pace that any beginner can enjoy and do. Being from a predominantly Hispanic area I found the Spanglish to my liking. Desi takes you on a peaceful journey that not only makes you feel great physically but mentally and spiritually at peace. Highly recommended!!!,1330646400,,656,4.173228346456693
3447550,5,B001ADXWYW,"I love this DVD, I am a newbie to Yoga and have purchased several ""beginners"" dvds that I have not been able to keep up with. In this DVD Desi is encouraging and easy to follow I use it daily and am loving the results.",1329091200,,218,3.8666666666666667
3447551,5,B001ADXWYW,"This was my very first Yoga video. I am fairly flexible already but hate to work out so I figured yoga would be a good alternative. I was right, but hesitant. Last winter on a ski trip I hit my knee pretty hard and as my knees are already weak it started really beginning to bother me. I finally decided I needed an alternative workout badly enough and bought a mat and this DVD. I don't have the time or money to go to a yoga class. I found Desi's voice to really fit my mood when practicing. The music is appropriate as well. The moves are fairly easy but challenging at the same time.  She explains basic yoga lingo and ideas throughout the workouts so that there is a practical understanding. Desi offers alternatives to the harder moves that even with good flexibility need easing into.  The Solar workout gets a light sweat going and the Lunar really unwinds the body with the twists. Best part is my knee is 10 times better! I love that it's indoors. I practice indoors so it's very relate-able. Some outdoor videos that I've seen tend to be distracting and/or cheesy. The room is lit and arranged well so you can see what she is doing. Eventually I learned to do most of it with my eyes closed. I've bought some other yoga videos but this one still stays with me, especially the Lunar session. Over all it's a great intro to Yoga. Not too spiritual, and not too workout video-ish, a good balance and stepping stone.",1325203200,3,1423,4.386363636363637
3447552,5,B001ADXWYW,"I rented this from the library and have rented various other beginner yoga dvds from Shiva Rhea to Rodney Yee.  I continue to come back to Yoga for Beginners with Desi Bartlett.  The Solar/AM and Lunar/PM, both 25 minutes, workouts are perfect for me because they are simple, straight-forward, and easy to follow.  There are no complicated sequences or awkward positions.  What i like is that my whole body is getting a workout.  It is definitely challenging but not too hard for those not looking to go crazy with yoga.  It is definitely the dvd I use on a daily basis, either for the AM or the PM.  Ideally, I'd love to incorporate both workouts daily.

There may be some cons for folks out there:
- in some instances, the instructor moves a little too fast
- this is definitely not for true beginners but for those that have been exposed to yoga already
- in some cases if you're not looking up at your tv, you might be missing a move (this might only happen in the beginning when you first trying to get a handle on the movements)
- no creative movements or expressions (which is good for me that just wants to be told what to do)

If you're like me and want to get it over with and get the results (toned body), this is the most likable yoga dvd that I have found so far.",1316649600,,1276,4.283333333333333
3447553,5,B001ADXWYW,"This is a well done video in comparison to other yoga videos that I have seen.  The music is soothing as is the instructor's voice.  I agree that is is not a good video for a beginner that is looking to learn the basic poses.  I have taken three semesters of yoga classes at Wichita State University and was looking for something more intermediate and this video definitely fills that void.  Some people have commented on the instructor's workout attire, so I will make mention of it.  I do agree that her top is too tight and low cut, however, I am more concerned with the quality of the work out, so I choose to ignore that aspect.",1314835200,,633,4.330508474576271
3447554,3,B001ADXWYW,"This is a good paced workout, probably a little fast for beginners though.  The only problem I had with this workout is that Desi does not do the exact same poses for each leg.  During the first series of standing poses, she says ""lets do this on the other leg but it was a completely different routine.  The rest of the workout flows smoothly after that.  Seems that they should have caught that during editing.",1291939200,2,412,4.453333333333333
3447555,5,B001ADXWYW,"""Yoga for Beginners"" is an excellent instructional DVD for anybody who is interested in exploring the practice of yoga. In this DVD, yoga instructor Desiree ""Desi"" Bartlett provides two one-half hour yoga routines, Solar and Lunar. Each of the practice sessions are challenging and through Bartlett's instruction, you will learn about the proper breathing techniques involved in the practice of yoga, many of the terms used in the art, and you will find that with continued use, this will result in greatly increasing your flexibility, building your strength, losing weight and toning your figure. I have been using this DVD every night with my family, alternating Bartlett's customized practice (Lunar and Solar) and have gained immensely by her video. I highly recommend this to anybody interested in improving their flexibility.",1290124800,,831,5.4
3447556,5,B001ADXWYW,"Exhilirating practice in the SOLAR and LUNAR. Half hour duration for both, I have used it daily on an alternating basis.  Satisfying addition to my regular rotation of short on time DVDs, I like Desi's sweet sounding voice (on the voiceover) crystal clear sound, she adds helpful info and sighs when she repeats ""to exhale.""  Excellent production and direction.  You'll be on the floor mat for SOLAR practice includes strengthening and re-energizing poses.  But, you'll do the sun salutation (Vinyasa Flow) with other poses such as my newly found favorite, ""dolphin pose"" which goes into the boat pose plus challenges thrown into such moves as the bridge pose with leg lift.  Continuing on the floor mat with LUNAR , it's all about stretch & the release of tension here.  Included is a lunge series with side bends, front fold (forward bends) series, then alternating with backward bends such as the bridge pose. Honestly, I've been practicing yoga for some time, but only on occasion, and this was appropriate for my level.  Not recommended for basic beginners, only because formal practice will give you the expert feedback on your poses.",1275782400,3,1140,5.0
3447557,2,B001ADXWYW,"I purchased this DVD because I practiced yoga over 5 years ago and wanted to start doing it again.  I don't feel that this DVD is for beginners. It is way too advanced and she does not go into any detail to explain the poses, plus her voice is taped over the segments.

I like exercise DVD's where the instructors' voice is talking throughout the DVD like you are in a yoga class in your own living room, she does not do this.

Actually the thing I find the most distracting and unprofessional is her choice of clothing for the sun portion of the DVD. .... Desiree is a beautiful, very well endowed woman and her yoga top is cut just way too low.  Others may not have a problem with it, but I certainly don't think it honors her as a yoga instructor.  Maybe it was done to increase sales?  Fortunately the second half of the DVD she has on a different top, so no problem there.",1266796800,7,877,4.190476190476191
3447558,5,B001ADXWYW,"When I first got this cd, I was 177 lbs and very out of shape.  I started doing both Solar and Lunar every day and at first I could not keep up with the video, and would have to stop and start the dvd.  But I kept trying and by the end of the first week, I was able to keep up with her (although dolphin pose is still a problem for me).

After using this video and adding 1 mile of jogging per day, I have lost 30 lbs in 4 months, and have never felt stronger.  I highly recommend this dvd to people who are just starting out with yoga and want to see results quickly.  I will keep using this video because I really like the production quality and Desi's instructions are greeat and her voice is very calming.  It's like having yoga and meditation in one dvd.",1260489600,27,759,3.993377483443709
3447559,5,B001ADXWYW,I am very happy with this yoga DVD.  I am doing the lunar part and am able to perform all of the postures.  Desiree's voice is very soothing and gives excellent cues so that sometimes I can do the postures with my eyes closed even though I just started doing it.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!,1257120000,4,282,4.283018867924528
3447560,5,B001ADXWYW,i liked Desi and her enthusiasm. i'm just getting back into yoga i liked the lunar workout and felt it challenged me without over challenging me. will add it to my weekly rotation.,1234137600,,180,4.484848484848484
3447561,2,B001ADXWYW,"Ultimately, I think if you already have a decent understanding of basic yoga, this video would be a good work out... I hope to work up to it. But if you have really never done yoga before and do not know much about it, this video is too fast and does not spend time on basic poses and correct form. I need something slower, that spends time  on getting the poses right. Eventually, I think this would be a good every day routine...",1233446400,22,431,4.192771084337349
3447562,5,B001ADXWYW,"I took some time off of yoga, and this DVD was the perfect way to get back into my practice.  I've practiced yoga for over 8 years and have had many teachers.  Desi is fantastic.  Her instructions are clear and, most importantly, encouraging.  I could follow the steps easily and felt like I actually understood why I was doing them!  I've recommended this to all of my friends, especially the guys -- if you're not ready to take a class, try this DVD first.  It's a great introduction to yoga.",1227744000,6,494,4.433333333333334
3447563,3,B001ADXWYW,"Menu options: music only, music & instruction, in English, Spanish or Spanglish. All instruction is given in voice over.

Solar 25 min:
Sitting on thighs & then up to kneeling w/deep breathing up/down, hands/knees for cat/cow deep breathing several times, single hand opposite knee balance a couple of times, repeat cat/cow & balance again. Downward facing dog, plank, lower chaturanga, cobra, down dog, quick 3 legged dog to crescent (knee on ground) with torso up & down to knee w/deep breathing, plank, chaturanga, cobra, down dog, repeat on other side.

Lunar 28 min:
Sitting cross legged & side torso stretches to left & right 3x each, then lift arms upward & down fwd stretch. Repeat side torso stretches 1x each & fwd stretch routine 2x more. Hands/knees cat/cow stretches & circular pelvic/torso fluid stretching for a nice time.

Reclined straight leg to head, figure 4 leg stretch for piriformis to chest, twist legs at knee & ankle spinal twist, repeat on other side. Bridge pose, knees to chest rocking, spinal rocking, butterfly, reclined butterfly, 1-2 min savasana.

Production quality is great as the trailer shows. Desi has a sweet voice that is overall soothing & seems honestly earnest in helping. She says the Sanskrit names & mostly energetic analogies to help you get into the pose which I think shows the more spiritual side of yoga rather then as just a weight loss/muscular workout like other dvds do. Beginner might be a bit lost because for those she doesn't give enough basic body placement, like foot placement for beginners unless you watch to mimic her body placement. I found her solar session VERY repetitive, and speedy aerobic feel of doing a pose in/out many times instead of the 1-2x with time to feel the stretch with mindfulness which is what I look for. The lunar was much more relaxing, and she did some alternate stretches not found on most yoga dvds, though it still had some repetitiveness like the solar. Desi does have some great body awareness which I saw by some poses she chose after another which works to perfectly balance the body energy, and I hope in her future dvds she lets it shine through instead of this more aerobic style.

3447564,5,B001ADXWYW,"this is a great dvd; especially for beginners
the flow is perfect to bring one in deep communion
you really feel the connectedness desi has within.
her inner connection comes across in the tone, pace & energy of the yoga practice on the dvd.
as a yogi, spiritual life coach & meditation teacher i highly recommend this dvd for beginners as well as a ""travel"" accompaniment to keep in the flow of one's yoga practice while traveling.

3447565,5,B001ADXWYW,"I am slowly learning to like yoga.  It's still not my absolute favourite workout, but this dvd is helping me even more to enjoy it better.  It truly is for beginners and even I found it easy(ish) to do.
Desi is a great instructor and she has a clear, calm way of cuing and the camera work also allows you to see the moves better and practice them yourself and follow along well.  There are two workouts, Solar and Lunar, which seem to be a trend now (doing an AM and PM workout).  The Solar one is energy boosting and the Lunar routine is more stretchy and slower paced to be relaxing.  It is meant to also lengthen your muscles which I feel it is probably doing.
I've done this three times now and I'm constantly getting a little better.  I find it great to do on hectic days because it really is relaxing, and each workout is under a half hour so it's not too hard to fit into your day.  I like this a lot and would highly recommend it to almost everyone.  It is very do-able.",1222128000,38,978,4.137566137566138
8277168,5,B001ADXWYW,"I got this several years ago without any yoga experience at all. I found it a little challenging to make the poses at first, but within a few days I noticed they were getting easier and easier. While having been a yoga beginner at the time of purchase, I can say that I didn't exactly think this video was tailored towards absolute beginners (as in someone who has never exercised or stretched, or is recovering from acute injuries). I will say that I suffer from various chronic injuries, including having gone through a microdisectomy in my lumbar spine, and doing the morning yoga on this video consistently has, without a doubt, lowered the pain in my back and has helped strengthen my weakened, nerve-damaged legs. Of course, consult your physician before starting any type of workout. My doctor and physical therapists gave me the green light once I was healed enough post surgery.

If you're a beginner, do remember that there will be days which you can hit all the poses without effort, and some days which your body just doesn't feel up to it. Even if you're a seasoned yoga pro, you will have those days! So don't get frustrated, and just have fun and keep at it!",1524182400,,1173,4.6124401913875595
8277169,5,B001ADXWYW,Love this DVD. I've been using it daily for 2yrs now and never get tired of it. I'm now in the best shape I've been in in years because of this daily yoga practice.,1512345600,,164,3.8529411764705883
8277170,4,B001ADXWYW,"This is a good set of practices for developing strength and flexibility. She's clear and direct, the poses are shown well, and while they can be fast moving the flow makes sense.

I did not give this five stars because I am iffy on the description of the target audience: true beginners. ""Easy-to-follow and non-intimidating"" depends on where you are on your journey. If this were the first yoga DVD in my collection and I had tried this before other DVDs that I have been using, I probably would not have continued. If you are not very fit and are new to yoga, this is not going to be the best start for you. A year and a half into my practice of yoga (late 40s, active but not exactly flexible) I can do most of what she demonstrates, although not everything, and I sometimes struggled to keep up with her moving from pose to pose. Last year I would have been totally lost. If you are brand new to yoga, Rodney Yee's Complete Yoga for Beginners or Barbara Benagh's Yoga for Beginners is a better place to start.",1486857600,2,1013,4.35978835978836

My wife had this video around the house so I tried it.  I watched the segments before doing the first workout.  There weren't any practices for different poses, and explanations of how to do them correctly.  If you know how to do the poses, I suspect this could easily be a four star video, but for a true beginner, I don't think it's a good fit.",1437436800,,508,4.294736842105263
