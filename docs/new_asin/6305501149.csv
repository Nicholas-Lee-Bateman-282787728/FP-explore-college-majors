Keeping one hand on his stash, and his other hand on his trigger, Dolomite took  what he wanted and he wanted it all.  and the music was FUNKY!",961113600,7,279,3.9642857142857144

7891570,5,6305501149,"Re-dubbed, re-edited but so much fun! Rudy Ray Moore's face was put on the cover, he's in it about 5 minutes but still a great film. With characters like the evil Two-pac, the trapper Davy Crockett and the topless ninja ho, this film will have you in disbelief and laughter at the wacky antics. A great martial arts movie made better with a touch of Dolemite!",1335139200,,359,4.454545454545454
7891571,1,6305501149,"I was expecting a new Dolemite movie, really this is a badly subbed Asian film with Rudy Ray Moore thrown in to ""watch."" LAME.",1110672000,4,126,4.291666666666667
7891572,5,6305501149,"This movie is so funny! The ghetto slangs used to dub over the real voices are hilarious! It has an east coast vs. west coast conflict;  making a spoof out of the east coast vs. west coast thing w/ rap music. Also one of the character's name is Tu-Pac, and his character is funny as hell! I love this movie, I don't know why some people don't like it. But then again, I also love South Park, which some people find offensive rather than funny. I guess if you love South Park you'll also love this movie.",1106352000,,503,4.185567010309279
7891573,3,6305501149,"Amazon doesn't provide a way to simultaneously give this 1 star and 5 stars...

I'm not familiar with rudy ray moore but disagree that this movie is not funny-c**p.  I've seen c**p-c**p and funny-c**p movies and this one is funny.  Some of the kung fu is actually cool, the plot is incomprehensible, the photography appalling, the ninja ho' hilarious, the dubbing just rubbish... but if like me you're a masochist stuck 4000 miles from home with just a DvD player and a month's unlimited rental from your nearby blockbuster, then this is definitely recommended.  But try not to pay for it or you'll be disapointed...",1098230400,,616,4.838095238095238
7891574,4,6305501149,"If you're buying this film because you're a fan of Rudy Ray Moore, or you're expecting to watch another Dolemite film, skip it!  This film can only be appreciated by kung fu film fans.
Shaolin Dolemite is comprised of footage that wasn't in the film released on DVD as 'Ninja The Final Duel'.  Apparently the full length of 'Ninja The Final Duel' is supposed to run for over 10 hours!!!  But only the edited version was released.  'Shaolin Dolemite' at least gets you an hour and a half closer (minus the Rudy Ray Moore footage) to having the full version.
So, like I said, DON'T BUY IT FOR RUDY RAY MOORE!!!  Buy it if you are a fan of Robert Tai's films and you want to get more footage from 'Ninja The Final Duel' that isn't on the Crash Cinema DVD version of the film.",1079740800,7,772,4.296551724137931
7891575,1,6305501149,"This movie was really painful to watch. Rudy Ray Moore was only in it for about four minutes alltogether. There was a ""Davy Crocket"" ninja, some gold robot dudes, and a topless ninja that actually attacked someone with her boobs. Incredibly stupid and a waste of time.",1074729600,2,268,4.723404255319149
7891576,1,6305501149,"I don't actually own this film (Thank GOD!!)  I did rent it however, and it stinks!  Rudy Ray Moore is past his Dolemite prime in this one.  The action part of it is slow and there is no recapturing the glory days.  My suggestion is to stick to the orginal and not this cheap imitation to reap money from the Dolemite name.",1039737600,3,323,4.161290322580645
7891577,4,6305501149,this is agreat movie put does not live up to the rest of the dolmite classics.its good if you love dolmite bad if your a kung fu fan if you like kung fu movies buy anything Jim Kelly.,1017187200,2,183,3.8421052631578947
7891578,1,6305501149,"I'm a big fan of Rudy's other movies, but this one isn't even in the same league. Basically they bought a lousy kung fu video and spliced in goofy  sound effects and a few scenes of Rudy making faces and commenting on the  action. Rudy's barely in the thing, and the tedious fight scenes go on  forever. Trust me, Rudy's made much better movies. If you're not familiar  with Mr. Moore's work, check out Dolemite, Human Tornado or Petey  Wheatstraw instead, you'll be glad you did.",967334400,9,480,4.534883720930233
