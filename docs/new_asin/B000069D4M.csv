1735200,2,B000069D4M,"Zzzzzzzzz.... Boring choreography. Very uninspired and sorta exactly what you'd expect..... only less! Drosselmeyer as a sorta David Copperfield version of Dr. Mesmer doesn't work. And, design-wise, it's like they can't decide what century the party scene should be in. Clara's father looks very 1860's, but her mother looks like an ill fitted, over decorated 1820's with a turban thing on her head that makes her look like she just got out of the shower. Indeed, every costume has a limp lifelessness to it that make it seem they've been laundered about 100 times. The girls and Clara at the party are just boring an drab, reflecting the pedestrian choreography.

Sorry... didn't bother with Act Two. I was afraid it would be just as dull.

Seriously, I would have stuck with it even with its awful designs if the choreography had been even a bit fun. But it wasn't. Baryshnikov's version has  not so great designs too, but his choreography and ideas are the best and very compelling. Design-wise, Stowell's version for Pacific Northwest Ballet, designed by Marice Sendak has got to be the best looking. And Stawell's choreography has clever brilliant ouches and novel ideas that aren't off the wall. It was released as a film in the '80s.

What disappointment was this Royal Ballet version.",1449705600,,1292,4.940092165898617

1735232,3,B000069D4M,"If all you want is a package that looks pretty on the outside, the Royal Ballet's 2009 Nutcracker is a snap. It's by a troupe recognized worldwide, Sir Peter Wright is an acclaimed choreographer/producer, it's on Blu-ray, a ton of glowing, five-star reviews sings its praises. How could you go wrong?

In two ways, unfortunately. First, the production itself turns the story into something quite different from the one Tchaikovsky set to music for ballet master Marius Petipa in St. Petersburg in 1892. Second is the performance of this staging (in its 25th year when this recording was made), over which hangs the air of tired routine.

The biggest change Wright makes in the story is adding action during the opening overture and the closing apotheosis that doesn't exist in Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker. Because this new plot isn't explained on-screen, you must have seen one of the two previous videos of Wright's production or read the synopsis in the liner notes to understand what's going on.

Wright's version makes the magician Drosselmeyer the central character. Because his mousetrap killed off half the mice in the palace, the vengeful Queen of the Mice changed Drosselmeyer's nephew into a nutcracker doll. The nephew can regain his human form only by destroying the Mouse King and being loved by a young girl. On impulse, Drosselmeyer takes the nutcracker/nephew doll with him to the Stahlhaum's Christmas party and gives it to young Clara, who falls in love with it and sneaks downstairs after bedtime to find it. But Drosselmeyer conjures up a battle between the mice and the toy soldiers, led by the Nutcracker Prince, who is in danger until Clara bops the Mouse King on the head. Then the doll turns back into his human form.

Drosselmeyer accompanies the happy couple through the Land of Snow to Act II's Land of Sweets, remaining to preside over the entertainments he has prepared for them. In Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker, Drosselmeyer does not appear in Act II, and his presence is annoying. After the fun in the Land of Sweets is over and Clara finds herself back outside her home, she meets the nutcracker/nephew and vaguely but not fully recognizes him. Returning to Drosselmeyer's study, he is warmly embraced by his surprised uncle, who has apparently forgotten he's seen his nephew throughout Act II.

To this unnecessary level of plot complications are added chauvinistically British elements. For example, during the early stage of the family party, Clara has a vision of an angel, then St. Nicholas shows up to bless the children, dressed like an Anglican bishop. Clara and the Prince are whisked away to the Land of Sweets by angels as though they're being escorted through the heavens to the Pearly Gates. Had Petipa and Tchaikovsky called for angels, they would not have been Anglican.

If Wright's production sounds OK, then you should look to the Royal Ballet's 2000 DVD with Alina Cojocaru as Clara and Anthony Dowell as Drosselmeyer, under the baton of Russian conductor Evengii Svetlanov&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nutcracker-Cojocaru-Dowell-Royal-Ballet/dp/B00005S6KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nutcracker/ Cojocaru, Dowell, Royal Ballet</a>. Fans of Wright's Nutcracker would have been much better served if Opus Arte had upgraded that lively performance to Blu-ray instead of issuing this plodding one from 2009. In the 2000 production, Cojocaru has enough sparkle and Dowell has the good taste not to let Drosselmeyer drain the life out of Act II. In this newer performance, Iohna Loots and Gary Avis don't have the charisma. The clarity of Blu-ray doesn't help. Because this Land of Sweets is almost devoid of color, Drosselmeyer's flamboyant green and blue cape is what keeps capturing the eye.

Most detrimental is Koen Kessels' flaccid conducting, which starts out slow and gets slower. And slower. The Arabian Dance crawls like a dirge, lacking any touch of sensuality. By the time the Waltz of the Flowers arrives, the pace is so ponderous that the corps de ballet can barely maintain its footing without falling over. Perhaps the tempo drags to help Miyako Yoshida in the Sugar Plum Fairy's variation. In her mid-40s when this performance was recorded, Yoshida has been a Sugar Plum Fairy specialist for a long, long time. She carefully tip-toes through the steps, concentrating mainly on keeping the beauty-contestant smile on her face directed toward the audience. There's nothing spontaneous here, no life.

The music of the apotheosis, which in this case leads to the final added scene, drags through the mud, maybe to permit the stage-set change. That's a portent that it's time to put this tired production to rest.",1411257600,12,4719,5.224570673712021
1735233,5,B000069D4M,"Great performance by the Royal Ballet with great production values. This is probably the best version of the Nutcracker to get on Blu-Ray at the moment.

1735260,5,B000069D4M,"This is the same Peter Wright choreography as in the previous, much loved, Royal Ballet production of about a decade ago. I, like many others no doubt, was rather hoping that that earlier recording would be transferred to the new Blu-ray medium. That was not to be, but instead we have a brand new recording of the same production, albeit with different or older, dancers to consider. For those interested in the DVD version only please note that Amazon does not allow such a distinction to be made when submitting a review of a disc available in Blu-ray. Please make allowances for that when reading the following and which may well contain useful comment anyway .....

As in all re-makes there is a mixture of pluses and negatives. The negatives will be most keenly felt by those who have formed a strong allegiance to the earlier issue of course. The same will no doubt be true of this issue in the fullness of time. As this recording was made during the current run with different lead dancers on different nights there will also be those who would wish the recording had been made on different nights.

None of that matters however when considering this new recording as the earlier one is not being transferred to Blu-ray and this is the only recording of this popular production now in its 25th year now available in the new medium. So this disc simply has to be considered entirely on its own merits as a recent example of this particular production. Bemoaning the lack of the previous production as a Blu-ray, or complaining about the choice of cast on this disc as some do are simply irrelevant considerations and not in any way helpful. Offenbach summed up this sort of situation as quoted at the end of this summary review.

In my opinion, given the circumstances and choices concerning this disc, it does very well indeed. All the lead parts are well danced technically and they are supported by excellent ensemble work. The magic of the ballet is fully caught and transmitted - one has only to listen to the enthusiastic support of the audience during the performance and the extended and rapturous 7 minutes of curtain calls at the end before the final fade-out to be sure of that.

The staging and costumes are both traditional and sumptuous in terms of ballet productions and the narrative is traditional and kind to all. The orchestra, under the direction of Koen Kessels, delivers attentive and high quality playing throughout, and what a fine score Tchaikovsky provided for our enjoyment. Pure musical bliss!

The actual recording is well up to the standards of Opus Arte with crisp and well defined visuals which provide a nice balance of close-up detail and panoramic views. The sound is both full and clear and is provided in both DTS-HD and stereo.

For me personally, much though I loved the earlier production referred to in the first paragraph, I feel more than compensated for by the many advantages of this new production, not least by the marvellous recording quality. Especially for those fresh to this production therefore, I am sure that 5 stars would seem to be an easily justified assessment. The same might be said for others such as me - I hope so, as in my opinion, it seems to be fully deserving issue and likely to give plenty of pleasure and satisfaction to many future purchasers.

As Offenbach advises in La Grande Duchesse 'If you cannot have what you love, then you must love what you have' .................... Appropriate advice perhaps for some enthusiasts in this particular case.

Visually, the disc is excellent. The image is so razor-sharp, you can actually see the texture of the scrims as you're looking through them! Try that with a conventional DVD.

The soundtrack is likewise very good. The orchestra is closely miked, with good balance between instruments and a wide stereo image.

Costumes, sets, lighting ... all very professional.

What's missing is the magic. The dancing is competent, but unexciting. The choreography is serviceable, but unimaginative. There are no surprises, no special moments, and very little humor. The battle scene is a big yawn. The transformation of the Christmas tree feels mechanical and ritualistic. Even Miyako Yoshida, admirably precise and ever-smiling, is bland as toast. It feels as if everyone's just going through the motions.

The previous DVD version by the Royal Ballet is better in every respect. Too bad it's not on Blu-ray.",1324857600,16,985,5.248407643312102
1735266,3,B000069D4M,"Technically brilliant, lushly presented, but artistically inferior to the 2001 Royal Ballet's setting of The Nutcracker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nutcracker-Cojocaru-Dowell-Royal-Ballet/dp/B00005S6KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nutcracker/ Cojocaru, Dowell, Royal Ballet</a>

 Pacing and tempos seem brisk, bordering on rushed.
 Silly overuse of thrown handfuls of glitter.
 Overlong Act I makes Act II seem rushed and downsized.
 Use of elaborate scrims and falling curtains distracts from ballet.
 Casting short, grotesquely over-leg muscled Nutcracker and Cavalier leads does make for technically flawless solos and pas de deux -- but it also becomes hard to watch and dramatically uninteresting.
 Long depth of field and extreme detail in the HD videography and Blu-Ray format combine to make it visually hard to concentrate on the primary action.
 Nine years on, Miyako Yoshida may or may not feel that she owns the role of Sugar Plum Fairy; some seem to think so. But the protesting-too-much defense of her casting probably foreshadows Yoshida-san's dignified and hopefully upcoming standing down to let more youthful dancers have a go.
 Iohna Loots is not compelling or quite believable as Clara.
 Drosselmeier seems to have become a control freak in the Land of Sweets, personally directing almost all action and entertainments. Distracting and stalls the action.
 Choreographer clears to a blank stage at one point in the Snowflakes sequence. Maybe this is meant to heighten anticipation... but it becomes ridiculous and irritating as the music plays and plays with no action except falling-confetti snow. And when the Showflakes do appear, we get less ballet and more hand-twinkles and flutters.

Been trying to find more positive points to mention, but that might take a while. I guess the upshot is that I bought this 2009 production to see what The Royal Ballet have done since 2001 with their setting. The flash and sensation seem greater, and the visual elements richer and no doubt more costly.

But the dance art and presentation seem to have suffered loss of focus and clarity in many small ways, perhaps by cumulative errors and choreographic tweaking introduced each time roles are handed off to new artists.

The effort feels akin to an old Christmas toy, repainted and retouched yearly but with underlying accumulated dings and scratches and half the corners rounded off. Found myself slipping into ho-hum while watching.",1324252800,20,2495,5.601063829787234

I gave it 4 stars b/c it is a charming version of Nutcracker, but I wanted others to know that others may have trouble playing on the computer. Maybe it works on a PC. I don't know.",1315440000,4,617,4.090909090909091
1735269,3,B000069D4M,"The photography of this DVD is rather ""flat"" lacking the vivid contrast and color associated with other versions of Nutcracker.  Some of the choreographic routines are repetitive and somewhat monotonous.

The production is lush and unbelievably beautiful, the Sugar Plum Fairy and Prince are excellent.

Vision and sound are superlative",1302998400,10,210,5.393939393939394
1735271,5,B000069D4M,"Our household got ""hooked up"" on the nutcracker this winter so we own a bunch of other recordings.
Barishnikov which is great but a TV production, not live performance.
Nureyev - disturbing.
Bolshoi (with Maximova from the late 70's). Great dancing, terrible orchestra.

This is my favorite. The dancing is nothing short of superb. The production is a joy to the eyes and the orchestra is a joy to my ears.

Highly recommended!",1301356800,34,427,4.835616438356165

1735273,5,B000069D4M,"This is the best Nutcracker ever.  I liked the previous Royal Ballet Nutcracker with Anthony Dowell as Drosselmeier, but this one is even better, with less cape-twirling on Drosselmeier's part, the best Nutcracker dancer I have ever seen, and Miyako Yoshida just as good as before but more relaxed and natural.  I'm glad that, if they only do one in Blu-ray, this is it!",1294358400,33,370,4.765625

7965865,5,B000069D4M,"This is everything and more than I hoped for. I knew a bit about ballet, not much. Years ago I saw a performance on TV ""from the second balcony"". It was hard to hold my interest. Not a fan. This past Christmas I recorded Philadelphia's Nutcracker movie to watch later. I did and I liked what little I saw of the actual ballet. Going through the list of the ballet on Amazon I saw Baryshnikov's Special Edition and ordered it. So sad. It appeared to be only a poor upgrade to dvd with no restoration though I may be wrong. I didn't enjoy watching except it did have closeups that I had hoped for. Sadly it was ""sugarfree"" and ended to soon even though I didn't like the picture quality having been spoiled in the last HD years. Then taking another look at the ballet list I saw this one. It had to be good. English never do anything halfway, it was quite new and was sugar coated. When it came I stopped everything and took it into the theatre and watched and wasn't disappointed. It was way more than I expected. When it came time to end according to the philly movie it kept on going I and was treated to much more sugar and it was heavenly. If your new to pro ballet this is the one you should start with. The Sugar Plum Fairy was divine or awesome or fantastic or............All I had hoped for and more. Watched it 5 times.",1521417600,,1327,4.228346456692913

As well as the gorgeous ballet, the dvd came with a beautiful booklet detailing the acts, complete with vibrant pictures.

7965870,5,B000069D4M,"After watching this performance, it's difficult to imagine a more ""definitive"" Blu-Ray production of this ballet.

Let me start by saying that the video and audio quality are superb.  I have a reference system in my home theater and I'm very picky when it comes to A/V quality, and both the audio and video here left me with no complaints whatsoever.  The orchestra is present but not overbearing, and you hear just enough footwork on stage to make you feel connected.  In some opera and ballet recordings the stage action can be too loud which not only makes the characters seem to stomp around, but also interferes with hearing the music; but if the stage action is inaudible the performance can seem too ""distant"" (sometimes eerily so).  This one gets it just right.

The staging and scenery are mesmerizing.  When the Christmas tree grows out of the stage it is truly breathtaking.

Also well done is the mix of broad camera work and close-up shots.  I have seen ballet and opera DVDs where you don't get enough shots of the entire stage to appreciate the big-picture choreography, and in others the jumping between different camera angles is so fast you feel like you're having a seizure.

As for the performers themselves... Gary Avis is wonderful as Drosselmeyer, not only dancing well but portraying his character with sensitivity.  Because of the HD video and close-up shots you do get to see the dancers' facial expressions, and Avis definitely conveys both his love for Clara and his yearning to have his nephew back.  Yoshida excels as the Sugar Plum Fairy, dancing with the right balance of grace and confidence.

Oh, and the extra features are fun too, especially getting to hear Peter Wright tell the story of the Nutcracker to the children in a rehearsal space.  Really cute.

HIGHLY recommended.",1488844800,5,1812,4.837662337662338

7965873,5,B000069D4M,"Watching the 2009 Opus Arte Royal Balet London Nutcracker is a nice Christmas tradition.  We saw it live many years ago in USA as kids.  As a child, it was a bit confusing to follow the story line.  This Blu Ray comes with a special feature that describes the ballet version of the story, which is based on 'The Nutcracker and the Mouse King'.  It's helpful for kids if the story is explained to them, & watching it on Blu Ray helps to take a break and explain different scenes.  And also, kids might sometimes have a hard time paying attention, so it allows you to stop for a break.  Even if kids don't understand all of the story line, they will still enjoy the costumes and dancing.  Seeing the Nutcracker live is a special treat, but having it available on Blu Ray is very convenient to enjoy in the comforts of your own home.  Viewed from the audience, some details can be missed, but the disc captures the most important parts of each scene, like having a front row seat.  The picture quality on a plasma TV was clear & excellent.  The sound through a Yamaha/Klipsch surround sound system was not the same as sitting in front of a live symphony orchestra, but it was very life like and realistic, especially at volume.  Even the sound of the applause was very realistic.  I enjoyed this disc very much & I feel that the price  was reasonable and I'm happy with my purchase.",1482278400,2,1379,4.403162055335969
