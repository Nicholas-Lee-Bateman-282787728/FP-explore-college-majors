6657901,4,B00NIZI9XY,"Appealing and attractive characters made this film interesting to watch, as gay father Diego must take temporary custody of his straight 15-year-old son Amando from the boy's mother.  But the story line was a bit all over the place:  resolving father-son estrangement, gay bashing, transsexualism, partner abuse, youthful dating, etc.  Still, the ""family"" of characters was so much fun that you could overlook the messy plot.",1417305600,5,425,5.409090909090909

6657903,5,B00NIZI9XY,"Originally released as `Azul y no tan Rosa' this film is set in Venezuela where we meet successful photographer Diego. He has a long term partner in Fabrizio who is a doctor and they are clearly in love. Fabrizio wants to take things to the logical next level, but Diego is not so sure. Then Diego gets a call from Spain from a his special female friend and lover whom he has a teenage son with. This is Armando and he has is already on a plane and Diego is supposed to meet him and take care of him for a while.

His arrival coincides with a tragic episode in the life of Diego and Fabrizio and puts an increased strain on what already is becoming an estranged relationship between gay father and straight son. What occurs is part coming of age, part dealing with loss and a lot of extreme emotions from unquestioning love to extreme homophobia.

This is one of those films that is unashamedly sentimental. The actors are all brilliant even when the plot stretches credulity and the coincidences start to pile up. That said I got all moist eyed watching this and was also able to laugh in places. In other words it was like a slice of real life where things are always going to get mixed up. In Spanish with good subtitles, it also features a fair bit of flesh on show; the opening credits feature a particularly erotic dance routine too. I found this an absolute joy from start to finish and that is despite the misgivings stated above. This is one film I can wholeheartedly recommend, gay themed but really a story about real love, real emotions and some great characters.",1416614400,7,1575,4.446366782006921

6657908,4,B00NIZI9XY,"I'd give this five stars if I hadn't seen ESTEROS the next night. ESTEROS sets an almost impossibly high standard. What's with all these good gay movies coming out of South America? This one is on an old theme--gay father, straight adolescent son--but the son's problem is not the father's sexuality but his neglect of the son. The father-son relationship is beautify presented. As in ESTEROS, the best moments are non-verbal, for instance the scene when the son stands by his grief-stricken father and wants to comfort him but doesn't know how. And the lovely scene of the tango lesson. Both son and father mature through their relationship. Well worth seeing.",1486080000,4,661,4.963963963963964

6657913,5,B00NIZI9XY,It was an excellent movie. The dynamics between father and son were real and believable. All of the characters maintained a high level of performance. We in the US need to be reminded of the struggles in many countries in being gay and vigilant in protecting our progress.,1483920000,,272,4.6875

6657920,1,B00NIZI9XY,"I would have rated the development of the father-son relationship and all the characters in that part of the movie 5 Stars, but the explicit gay bashing scenes, which were unnecessary to the central theme of the movie, put a black pall over my enjoyment of the overall movie. I'm certain the death of the partner could have been portrayed in a less explicit way.

I know hate crimes even worse than that depicted occur everyday in every corner of our world; but as an intelligent adult, I do not need to see the commission of the crime and what happens to the victims, mentally and physically, to know it is horrific and to believe the perpetrators should be punished in kind. If the director and producers wanted to make a movie about this crime against mankind, a separate movie dealing with it would have been more appropriate.

I was also disappointed whoever wrote the description of the movie chose to whitewash the explicit content, calling the murder a 'tragic accident'. It was tragic, but it was no accident. It was a well-planned and hatefully executed, merciless act.",1477872000,,1079,4.73404255319149

6657925,5,B00NIZI9XY,"Movie started out slightly disjointed, and being in spanish, hard to follow.  But once the main actor's son arrived from Madrid, the story transformed and took shape into a beautiful movie.  The son was absolutely gorgeous and dreamy. Forced to stay at his dad's apartment during his stay, he was caught up in his life.  His feeling of rejection and abandonment by his dad went awy as he got to know him, and a close relationship and bond between the 2 developed and grew.  by the end, they were father and son again - very closely knit to each other.  There are very few gay themed movies that end on a positive note, which is such a shame, but this one ended in an extremely positive note.  Very uplifting, and pleasant.  I highly recomend the movie.",1457654400,4,752,4.485294117647059

6657931,5,B00NIZI9XY,Funny  and heartfelt movie,1439769600,,26,5.5
6657932,5,B00NIZI9XY,"A beautiful film from Venezuela.  The title actually translates as ""Blue and Not So Pink,"" but has been dumbed down to ""My Straight Son.""  The movie is an exploration of things we wish were different and how we deal with them - be they the tragedies of life, first love, gender identity, physical appearance, bad relationships, self-confidence.  Every character offers a different element that they struggle with and their own unique solution.  The film wraps it up in wonderful, believable relationships and intelligent dialogue.  The plot takes you a bit all over the place, but the story never looses your attention.  The actors are all uniformly brilliant and the emotion is genuine.  Courageous and heartwarming, this is meaningful work and well worth anyone's time.  One of my favourites.",1435795200,5,794,5.1484375
6657933,4,B00NIZI9XY,A good DVD with a lot of meaning,1435708800,,32,3.125
6657934,5,B00NIZI9XY,"This is the best gay themed movie that I've watched and I've seen most of the highly rated ones.  This was mostly drama with some touches of comedy.  It involved a gay father who had never been much involved in his son's life and had not been in contact with him in the last 5 years.  The mother needed to send him for a long visit with his father when the boy was 15 and definitely heterosexual. The story involved the son learning to accept that his father was gay, but that he was much more as an individual than his sexual orientation.  For the father's part, the son brought him to the point of being able to commit to relationships which he had not previously been able to do with his partner.  The grief the father suffered after learning his partner had been mortally wounded and then died after  a brutal gay bashing scene resulted in a very touching bonding scene between the father and son.  The father grew into and fully accepted his father role and the son was grateful to finally have the father who  had been missing in his life.  Above and beyond the story itself, the movie was made and set in Venezuela where the attitude about homosexuality seemed more like it was in the USA about 50 years ago before Stonewall and the push for equal rights.  The movie seemed to have an underlying theme of educating and promoting understanding in an effort to lessen discrimination against homosexuality in Venezuela.",1429660800,8,1423,4.5234375
6657935,3,B00NIZI9XY,"I was disappointed with  this film. The acting and other technical credits were  excellent.. What I didn't like was having too many stories  in the one  film. There was the son, his girlfriend ,his father,his lover and the bashers..It should have left out the bashing scenes  as  they were not necessary . It is becoming a  clich  to include  gay bashings in  films. The eventual outcome of such scenes  were not credible.  .The story was very predictable and you knew  how it would end  shortly after it  began..",1429401600,,513,4.670454545454546

6657937,5,B00NIZI9XY,"Wonderful and a passionate film which is thick with drama. This is a reality induced film of life. This is an eye-opening beautiful experience. Stunning solid script, acting and direction. Truly a gifted way of showcasing a film through its personal side and created a reality based setting of family dynamics.

A clear film. I loved the concept and reality to this film and the ultimate message it had and taught and brought forth. It was a clear film, what I mean by that is the storyline was so touching and filled with the passion of characters that it leaves such a huge mark on your mind and heart. It truly stands out in more ways than I can express in written form. It shinned because of the message and point and reality it was making.

Its films like this that I feel make a social statement and shine upon the viewer to want to express an emotional side while watching a film like this. I think every man or person should see this film and experience its ultimate message and deep reality that it brings forth. A gay father having to deal with his straight son who disapproves is something unique and very original. I loved the flow of the film but most of all it was the chemistry between Guillermo Garcia and Ignacio Montes. Both magically if you will played off each other in an eye opening fashion that bleeds the term masterpiece performances. Montes is stunningly crafted in the art form of acting. He owned his part as the son to the father he does not understand or accept. Passionate emotional performance that truly stands out. Garcia is equally the same as you get to know him and experience him as a character that comes to life through the top notch brilliant performance by Garcia.

6657939,3,B00NIZI9XY,"A technically well done film with competent performances, but the relatively rapid change in attitude on the part of the son is not entirely credible and takes away from the ultimate enjoyment of the film.",1422489600,,205,4.885714285714286
6657940,5,B00NIZI9XY,"Very enjoyable movie, good message. Venezuelan are or used to be homophobic, this movie shows acceptance, love, and friendship. I would have loved to see more of Venezuela, more natural/outdoor sceneries. I would highly recommend this movie to all Venezuelans and non-Venezuelans. I watched it with 20 more people and they were all very pleased with it.",1422489600,,353,5.2105263157894735

8678480,5,B00NIZI9XY,"Outstanding movie. I just finished watching it, and I wish I could write well enough to explain how wonderful this movie is. The acting is superb, the cinematography outstanding, the story extraordinary. What could have been a simple story about a gay father and his straight son is far more than the title suggests. The son's surprise arrival is understandable albeit a bit of a stretch and the following tragedies balanced with glorious successes kept my attention throughout. This is an outstanding movie on so many levels. I wish I understood Spanish but following the subtitles was not at all difficult. I surprised myself by turning up the volume so I could hear the tenor of the actor's voices. The nuances in tenor were just as important as the dialogue itself.",1522022400,,769,4.877862595419847
8678481,4,B00NIZI9XY,This film will touch the heart of any man who has been married and has children with his wife and turns to his true nature as an out gay man. The relationship is rarely easy. This is a beautiful film.,1520640000,,200,4.025
8678482,5,B00NIZI9XY,"The movie took me a bit by surprise as I had expected a totally different scenario based on the trailer I saw many years ago. The story is about a father who reconnects with his now-teenage son after not seeing him for 5 years. While the father-son relationship is one important aspect of the film, the scenario also revolves around different characters and story-lines thus making the film even more poignant. The ultimate message? I am what I am. So what?

I agree with a few of the comments that this is another nice gem coming out of South America (in this case, Venezuela). I recommend this film without hesitation.",1514332800,,620,4.636363636363637
8678483,3,B00NIZI9XY,"An ok movie, maybe. I watched the whole thing. More violence and darkness than suggested by the summary or trailer. Plus an odd out-of-place intro!  Would have liked more father/son interaction. (Mis-prompted by the poor English title?) Bigger negative for me was that the English subtitles ran seconds behind the dialog. Maybe a Spanish speaker would give a better review.",1511913600,,373,5.216666666666667
8678484,5,B00NIZI9XY,"This is a story of life and love in all of its complex, emotional, beautiful, yet sad and tragic!  Film is really a complex assortment of events that are all woven into a very magnificent film event.  Take the person you love and hold so dearest and close to view it.  You will not be disappointed!!  NJMJr!!
PS Just finished viewing this film for the sixth time.  The interaction between this man's son and himself is classical parental guidance and love!  The loss of one's partner whether it be from natural or violent events, can be the most devastating occurrence of your life.  No words both written and oral can begin to describe the pain, suffering, anxiety, and trauma that one feels!!  NJMJr!!",1503446400,,703,4.658536585365853
