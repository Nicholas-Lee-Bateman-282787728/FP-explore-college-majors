1822017,5,B00007M5IP,"I love this movie so much; in fact, I watched it over and over again. Ally Walker played a boring Susan who would not trust in Santa Claus as well as love. Thanks to Susan's little ghost, she finally realized the importance of life and the beauty of love.",1148515200,3,255,4.224489795918367
1822018,5,B00007M5IP,"Many good Christmas movies have a redemptive theme, such as A Christmas Carol. Some Christmas movies build their theme around self discovery, such as It's a Wonderful Life; and some Christmas movies plead with us to rediscover the Kid within us, such as A Christmas Story or Home Alone. If You Believe weaves all these themes together into a magical story.

The Plot is simple: Susan Stone has worked hard to squeeze all the magic out of her life until she is left lonely, disillusioned, and on the fast track to be fired from her publishing job. Her younger self appears, forces her to take chances, and to rediscover the magic of life. What keeps this story from being just another cliche are the other characters that appear throughout the story: The lawyer from Connecticut, Thom Weller, who has written a weird but funny novel about his physic family; Robin the assistant, who is terrified of Susan; Dorinda, the office competitor who specializes in dirty books; and Mark, the with-it Editor with lots of savey.

The journey is what makes this story a pleasure and reminds one that recovery from self inflicted pain can take place only if one begins to believe in one's self. This very simple film has become a family Christmas tradition.",1134000000,23,1243,4.776744186046511
1822019,5,B00007M5IP,"What A Treasure This Movie Is...I Bought It A While Ago On VHS, I Loved It!! I Bought The Dvd As Soon As I Saw It, It Is One Of The Best Christmas Movies Ever Done!!!

Great Sunday Afternoon Movie!!!",1132444800,6,357,4.343283582089552
1822020,5,B00007M5IP,"While navigating the road to success and fortune, book editor Susan Stone (Ally Walker) has become cynical and jaded, abandoning the youthful idealism and enthusiasm which propelled her forward in the first place. As a result, Susan has lost her personal and professional momentum, and is in danger of losing not only her job but also the love of her family. All this changes when a strange but adorable seven-year-old girl named Suzie (Hayden Panettiere) enters Susan's life, apparently with the express purpose of jolting the heroine back to humanity - and guiding her toward the true love of her life. It may not be difficult to guess from the outset whom the ebullient ""Suzie"" really is. A typical but nonetheless enjoyable Christmas-season offering",1119657600,5,753,5.080645161290323

1822022,5,B00007M5IP,of watching this movie; it's unlike any other.  The whole inner child idea is such a clever way to get the main character to find out what she's really about.

1822129,2,B00007M5IP,"There is a saying writers have: ""Show, don't tell."" It means the characters reveal the story through behavior, not by the use of words. This film is guilty of constantly telling (that's the script, not the director or the actors). But the acting is typical of TV movies, not of films, so it isn't genuine, it isn't believable. The main character has an arc (she changes) but we knew the ending when the story first began because it's so predictable. I do think these actors have talent that could be drawn out by the right director but that didn't take place here. It was organized and it's obvious that a lot of work went into it but I didn't feel any emotion, I wasn't drawn into the movie, I didn't root for the characters, I didn't care about the characters. It's a fluff piece.",1465430400,,782,4.4375

1822346,3,B00007M5IP,"One tough thing to deal with was watching this in the Spring, and its a movie that takes place during the Christmas holiday season. Another thing was the fact that this movie was not that original. The movie The Kid with Bruce Willis is very similar to this movie. Lastly the movie was very predictable. I actually enjoyed the little girls character more than Hayden Panettiere who played her adult self. But then again that was her character, that being a single woman who worked herself in to a rut. The moral or the story is kids say the darnedest things, sometimes they are right, only we don't listen to their advice. I gave it three stars because Amazon list that as ""It's Okay"". What kept me watching the movie was some laughable office scenes. If I had to give special credit to any actor in the movie it would be her African co-worker who speaks up in an office get together, and gets everyone to take notice. That was a great scene. One thing that kept me believing is the bump on the head that started it all. Little things in life happen, and you don't know side effects you will get from them.",1463788800,,1106,4.4

It doesn't follow the movie clich of an older person switching roles with a younger one. Rather, it presents a struggle between a jaded adult and her younger self when she was a happy, fun loving child. It also speaks to those have spent too much of themselves in trying to please others. While billed as a drama, I found it quite funny and thought provoking. It reminds us older folks not to turn a deaf ear to our inner child.",1462406400,2,518,4.40625

1822735,5,B00007M5IP,"This is such a beautiful, funny, heartwarming movie.  Susan Stone (Ally Walker) is a 37-year-old woman who has been beaten down so much by life that she has lost her joy.  She no longer has the ability to connect with people on an emotional level and is just going through the motions of living.  As such, her life in on the verge of total collapse.  Then comes 7-year-old Suzie Stone (Hayden Panettiere), who is Susans inner child.  No one can see or hear her except Susan.  Suzie has arrived in the nick of time to tear down the walls that Susan has built up around her, and help Susan to find her joy.  Both Ally and Hayden give amazing performances that will melt your heart, and Hayden, thankfully, manages to avoid the pitfalls that often make child actors so annoying.

One day her inner child shows up and announces she is not going to go through one more year without any fun.  Hayden Panettiere did a great job of playing young Suzie and really steals the show.  If it wasn't for her this movie would bomb.  Walker plays the role too hard and Tom Amandes, the author of the book she is editing, reminds me of Mr. Rogers from Mr. Roger's neighborhood.

I don't mind 'feel-good' movies, holiday or otherwise; but I just could not get into these characters. Once in awhile I get that warm feeling, then one of the main characters zaps it away.

I recommend this hightly!!!",1231459200,3,254,4.08
1822811,5,B00007M5IP,I thought Hayden Panettiere was absolutely delightful in this movie! She captures being a child so wonderfully. And Ally Walker (an actress I didn't care for until I watched this movie) was GREAT in this! I just loved this film the very first time I watched it and have watched it many times since. Guess it's time to buy the DVD! You will not be disappointed in this movie - don't miss it.,1221350400,3,390,4.3561643835616435

1822813,5,B00007M5IP,"I love to watch the Christmas movies and specials.  I frequently record them to watch at a later time.  I re-use the tapes after I watch the shows.  But I didn't re-use the tape from 'If You Believe'.  Even my grown sons enjoyed this movie.  It seems to capture the essence of the reality that we only have one life, and we miss out if we live only for the grind of work and responsibilities.  Every time I watch 'If You Believe', it helps me remember to stay in touch with my more idealistic self, the 'crusader' from my earlier days.  It's a good lesson at Christmas, and any time of year.",1199577600,3,591,4.223214285714286
1822814,2,B00007M5IP,"This is the most annoying acting Hayden Panettiere has ever done. I loved all the other movies she was in and thought this would be cute and fun to watch, boy was I wrong! She was loud and abnoxious. That mixed with Ally Walkers sour and boring personality along with bad acting, made this movie horrible! My family watching it with me - half of them left the room and the rest of us were disappointed! We were all annoyed!",1199318400,,423,4.3
1822815,5,B00007M5IP,"Hi all,
  I saw this movie the first night it aired and I loved it instantly. I recorded it. I had to introduce it to my mom,and since then it has become a family favorite.  These two actresses(Hayden & Ally)are splendid actors.  I laughed so hard when I first viewed it, and still do. I love the part when Susan Stone is trying to ignore her child self; while taking a shower and Hayden annoys her completely ""I used to be an innie but now I'm an outie,innie outie,innie outie.""  I definitely recommend this movie. - Denise Dear",1196812800,3,529,4.357142857142857
1822816,5,B00007M5IP,"...you will love ""If You Believe"". I was searching for this film and am thrilled to be able to order it on DVD. This made for television Christmas film has stayed with me since it first aired. It spoke to my often neglected *Inner child* and how we, as adults, sometimes lose that very special and sweet part of ourselves. You can read about the movie's particulars in the words above this review so I will only say that it has heart, a joyful spirit and a tender message. How sad it is when we grow up and lose what is innocent and dear and trusting about ourselves. All too often life is not an easy ride but to lose our childlike gentle spirit, sense of whimsy and the ability to believe in something we can not see is the real enemy. This movie reinforces this belief.
A treasure to be watched with the entire family. I look forward to sharing it with my daughter this year. I well remember watching it with our son when it was first on television. What he first believed to be a *chick flick* soon captivated him just as it did me.
See it, enjoy it, share it!",1195776000,8,1064,4.220588235294118
1822817,5,B00007M5IP,"The blurb on the case says, ""A Christmas classic your family will treasure"" but that is silly. This movie, which happens to take place during the Christmas holidays, has a story which has special meaning for people who know what it is like to withdraw, to pretend to live, and to sneak through the workday afraid... knowing that you will be caught and always afraid that today will be that day. While it is a miraculous turn of events which forces Susan Stone to confront where her life is and where it must inevitably lead if she doesn't act, no magical means are involved in her journey back. It just a series of decisions to actually live her life again.

What sings to one person can come across flat for another, I know, but I really believe this is a movie that has a lot to say to people who find themselves mired in the same trap Susan Stone was in.",1168473600,3,857,4.3229813664596275

I have watched this 3 times over the last few years, and I get something new out of it each time I watch it.",1514246400,,373,3.9466666666666668

Remembering our core essence is so important when life gets heavy, and problems that seemed insurmountable can seem to dissolve right before our eyes.
