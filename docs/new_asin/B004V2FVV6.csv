8442656,4,B004V2FVV6,"'Koshish' tells the heartwarming story of a deaf woman Aarti and a deaf man Hari. What happens when a deaf man and a deaf woman fall in love? What follows is a story. Through the ups and downs of life, Aarti and Hari move passed all obstacles to make a home for themselves. Only Gulzar can tell a story so beautifully. The artiste put a lot of soul into the making of this moving piece of cinema and this is obvious in the tenderness and sensibility of the movie. 'Koshish' is both poetic and realistic. He introduces the school of the deaf and briefly portrays the life of the deaf and blind but he does not go overboard as he returns to the two main characters and continues their story. Gulzar's execution and writing is outstanding. There's a beautifully poetic scene set on the beach where Aarti and Hari describe the sunset to a blind Uncle Narayan. Then there's a chilling sequence set during a rainy night when Kanu breaks in his sister's house to steal her necklace and what follows is a tragic outcome. Gulzar's background score flows beautifully with the film. Sanjeev Kumar and Jaya Bhaduri share a lovely chemistry and act very naturally giving us memorable performances. These two are always known to have a great on screen chemistry and in 'Koshish' their acting depends on body language more than anything. Yet, they seem to pull it off with ease. Dina Pathak too is excellent as the supportive mother and Asrani is quite good. My only complaint would be to avoid the song at the school function. This sequence does not add much and it only hinders the constant flow of the screenplay. Nonetheless, this is only a minor flaw and 'Koshish' remains a beautiful story of love, courage, survival and life.",1305849600,,1717,4.632786885245902
