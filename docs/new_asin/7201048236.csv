I can tell you i loved it way back when and i still love it today Thank you once again",1365811200,,185,3.5365853658536586
1111770,1,7201048236,"The product was described as Region 0 (""region free""), yet I received a Region 4 DVD. My standalone DVD player and one of my computers refused to play the discs, stating that they were Australian Region 4 DVDs. At least another computer was able to play them. When I mentioned the incorrect product description on the ""leave seller feedback"" option (since it is being sold by an Amazon 3rd Party Vendor), the seller emailed me asking me to remove my negative ""seller feedback"".

If the product delivered was Region-0, I would have given it five stars, since the original ITC program is a good program, along the lines of other ITC programs of that era, such The Prisoner, Secret Agent, Dangerman, Space 1999, etc.",1349308800,4,713,4.75
1111771,5,7201048236,"I enjoyed this series as a youngster but was never able to see all the episodes. Now I have. :-)

The dubs are very good quality, both visually and aurally. I also enjoyed the extras, which include a ""Catch up with the cast"" section.

The only caveat is that you need a region-free or Region-2 player, which I already had.",1345334400,,322,4.35
1111772,2,7201048236,"You need a multi region dvd player to see this.  It was ok. I saw some episodes in the late 60s as a pre teen. As an adult I must say they were nothing to write home about,  There are better things to buy.",1345075200,,205,3.6363636363636362
1111773,4,7201048236,"Yes, I had purchased the A&E set a few years back and got tired of waiting for them to release the second set here in the USA. So, I got myself a region free DVD player and ordered this set. I have mixed feelings about the quality. On the one hand, as I could not find these additional 15 episodes anywhere else... I am very glad to have finally been able to watch them. However, I think I may have an understanding now as to just why A&E did not release the second set. I think it was due to the quality of some of the masters available. A few of the episodes (4-5) which were among those NOT available thru A&E, have moderate to poor sound quality with the music tracks drowning out the dialogue occasionally and a warbling in the music soundtracks also at times. And as there are no subtitles, I have no idea what was being said during those parts of episodes. So, therin lies my mixed revue. --- Incidently, the seller sent me a replacement set and the same sound problems were in the same places in the new set as well... so it seems clear that the problem is in the original masters available... BUT, I am still gratified to be able to have seen these episodes again, finally! I love this show! Too bad it was only one season...",1304380800,12,1234,4.233050847457627
1111774,4,7201048236,"I remember as a child,  the whole family would sit down once a week to watch ' The Champions'.  My memories of this show over the years has been of an action packed, almost supernatural thriller.
I recently purchased the box set of the series and have begun to watch it and to relive those memories.  I'll admit that while it doesn't seem quite as thrilling as it did when I was 10 or 11 years of age, it is still
a damn good piece of entertainment.  The three leads were fabulous, I especially loved Alexandra Bastedo she was so beautiful. The plots were sometimes a little far fetched, but it was always totally believable and fun to watch.
I recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoyed those 60's spy thrillers and this one has an added bonus with the three special agents having special powers, obtained when their plane crashes in Tibet, in the first episode.
They don't make shows like this anymore, nowadays the special effects take over.",1298764800,10,942,4.523529411764706

Dear Sirs,
I would like to comment my disappointment with the item I have purchased earlier last year.  It is not about the the series;  it is the seller  mediamash who did not comply with our agreement.  In a few words to explain what happened, one of the disks was not functioning perfectly when received so after mentioning it to the seller, he asked us to send the malfunctioning disk  to him after communicating via email and so we did paying almost USD 25 in registered air mail to secure shipment.  After this we never heard anything from the seller and he never replied to our several requests of whereabouts.  Now I find myself with an incomplete set of The Champions.
I never heard again from the seller nor I have received a new disk back neither my old one. What is what we can do in this situation?  Please let me know,
Kind regards

1111776,5,7201048236,"The Champions is part espionage, part fantasy adventure. Craig Stirling, Sharron Macready and Richard Barrett are agents for a United Nations law enforcement organization called ""Nemesis"", based in Geneva. In the first episode, their plane crashes in the Himalayas and they are rescued by a mysterious old man. Afterward, they find they have extraordinary powers.  This set, produced by Network who also did the fabulous UK sets for THE PRISONER and DANGER MAN,  includes all 30 episodes plus hours of extras and a few commentaries. The video transfers look good.",1274227200,7,563,5.2444444444444445
1111777,5,7201048236,"I won't put a product description here as I already did on the A&E copy and on another set at the UK store. I will say this, however.  The good news, this is a complete set unlike the A&E one being half the series.  The bad side, 1) It is region 2 issue, if you want to play it here, you need a region free player. 2) The price that the marketplace sellers here are asking (at present) is too dang high, England's marketplace sellers want much less for it.  3) There is also a newer release set available from Amazon's UK Store with a 9th disc which includes a 40th anniversary reunion interview with the cast and crew, and the feature length ""Legend of the Champions"" that was recreated in 1983 out of the 2 episodes ""The Beginning"" and ""The Interrogation"". 4) This newer set (recently reissued again in 2010, no change from the 2007 release except in cover art) frequently sells for less than what American Marketplace Sellers want for this older set (I have noticed my review recently merged with some reviews on the 2010 re-release being sold there).  Buy that one (and a region free player) and enjoy a great show.",1204156800,19,1119,4.443902439024391
7899706,5,7201048236,"It's been a long wait, but I finally got the whole thing in airing order!  This series ran one season, and was released in part (supposedly the 'first half') by A&E a few years back.  Turns out the fifteen episodes were not in airing order, but were cherry-picked, or perhaps it was syndication order.  No matter - the episodes are all here complete with airing dates.

For those new to it, the lead trio of Nemesis agents were 'enhanced' by a lost civilization in Tibet after a plane crash in the Himalayas following a dicey mission to Red China.  The enhancement was just that - they each have unique 'powers' that quite possibly are dormant in others, plus super-senses of hearing, etc.  Told to keep their new talents secret (so the world didn't go looking for the source), Sterling, Barrett, and Macready become a top team, complete with ESP and ultra-fast reflexes.  Granted that the transfers were done from available material, it is none-the-less a relief to have the COMPLETE series.  Others have mentioned sound problems; when dealing with rare video be happy it exists at all.  Includes some nice bonus extras.  BE AWARE YOU NEED A MULTI-FORMAT PLAYER such as a universal DVD/Bluray deck to play this back!",1493769600,2,1217,4.779904306220096

7899713,5,7201048236,"This TV show was my grandmother's favorite and I'm looking forward to watching it now and remembering those good times.  I almost returned the DVDs because they are Region 2 only and can't be watched on US players unless they are region-free.  But, once I found out I could watch the show on my PC, problem solved!!",1401148800,,315,4.508771929824562
7899714,5,7201048236,I wanted to have a second since I watch it so often my first one is getting scratched a bit.  I really love the show!,1396569600,,117,3.68
7899715,5,7201048236,"First let me say I purchased the 9 DVD Boxed Set from the UK and it is the Region 2 edition I watch in the United States on my Region Free DVD Player.  The picture and sound are both crystal clear and sharp.  I will not go into all of the details on this series as if you are already a fan then you will know quite a bit.  If not and are new to The Champions I have provided links below that I think you will find helpful.

One big important note and that concerns the ""Air Order"" and ""Filmed Production Order"" as there seems to be some confusion as the 9 disc DVD set is not in the same order as the ""Aired Order"" and I can explain.  This DVD set as one reviewer has done has followed the air order episodes and placed the DVD episodes as if they were the production order.  They are not.  I have no idea as to why the 9 DVD set is at least in Air or Production order but it seems to be of their own choosing.  There is a booklet that comes with this DVD set (which the above reviewer did not have in his set) that explains the filmed production order.  Not every date is given but it was all filmed in 1967 and not aired until 1968-69 allowing the people in charge of The Champions to place them in any order they wanted which is what the people did who released this 30 episode set to make  their own order.

It is not clearly marked on the packaging where all the special features are but if it is an actual episode you will have to go to the view episodes section and click onto that episode to see all the features.  The same goes for Disk 8 as it only shows 2 episodes but once you load the disc the Special Features section shows along with the Play and Scene Selections.

I have included the filmed production order to help everyone out as listed in the included booklet by Mike Richardson which was first published in Action TV magazine.  Action TV is the British Magazine of Archive and Cult Television.

Watching the last episode and final filmed scene of the 30 episode series reminded me of the old westerns about the cowboy riding into the sunset at the end of the movie.  I suggest if anyone is a purist and want to see the series as it was filmed then follow the order below and I think it might provide a better more enjoyable viewing experience.

One last note before I leave you to the information below as you will see the pilot episode The Beginning was actually filmed third and originally was a 90 minute written script but the script was cut to 50 minutes before any filming for the series when it was decided not to do the series in 90 minute episodes.
