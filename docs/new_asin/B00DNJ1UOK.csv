8594970,5,B00DNJ1UOK,"This video is extremely well done. An innovovated tool which can be used in the field of domestic violence. To have an effective and unique program such as 'DVSD Break the Cycle' to aid in the healing of those who have experienced the unthinkable, domestic violence. An awesome tool.",1372550400,,283,4.795918367346939
8594971,5,B00DNJ1UOK,I really enjoyed seeing this re-enacted but true-to-life dialogue.  It gives hope for healing on both sides of the very painful - and all too widespread - problem of domestic violence.,1372291200,,184,4.935483870967742
8594972,5,B00DNJ1UOK,This documentary is very touching and innovative.  I like that the two people are brave enough to share very intimate details of their painful experiences with a total stranger who has every reason to hate.  I also like the ending in that (spoiler alert) the two people attain peace within themselves rather than reconciliation with their previous partners.,1372291200,,357,5.137931034482759
8594973,5,B00DNJ1UOK,"This is a fantastic product for the classroom or for a group learning experience about techniques for restorative justice. The video is extremely well done, and the emotions portrayed are as realistic as if you were sitting in the room during an actual dialogue. This would be great to show students in a political justice course to expose them to a successful restorative justice intervention approach!",1372291200,2,403,5.121212121212121
8594974,5,B00DNJ1UOK,"I highly recommend this DVD, for it provides a thorough study and commonsense approach to this volatile and often misunderstood topic. Logically presented and wide-ranging in its scope, it provides the novice and the professional alike with a good, solid foundation of facts. An excellent addition to any collection in both form and substance.",1372291200,2,343,5.37037037037037
8594975,5,B00DNJ1UOK,As an attorney who has represented both victims and perpetrators at various times during my career I've seen the horrible results of domestic violence. It is a sad and tragic situation for everyone connected in any way to the relationship. DVSD's approach is innovative and unique and I can see the potential for really positive and lasting change through the program by allowing victims to engage in meaningful dialogue with abusers and vice versa.,1372291200,2,449,5.081081081081081
8594976,5,B00DNJ1UOK,"I was blown away by this video and the empowerment it gives to all involved. The DVSD program is a unique program in that it truly helps the healing of those victims of domestic violence by allowing them to find some closure with their offender without having to face them.  This video captures the delicacy and thoughtfulness required for such a feat, yet clearly shows that it CAN be done and has much healing power.  I recommend this video for anyone who is impacted in any way, no matter how great or small, by domestic violence.  We are only more helpful in the healing process by more knowledge! Great work!",1372291200,2,613,4.554545454545455
