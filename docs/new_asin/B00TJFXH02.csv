7011122,2,B00TJFXH02,"This is like a generic Cliff's Notes version of Orson Welles.  It's not bad, but you could find as much -- or more -- information by reading Wikipedia and watching a few YouTube clips.",1433376000,,184,4.411764705882353
7011123,4,B00TJFXH02,"This documentary has been highly praised by many reviews in the press with good reason. It provides a very good biography of Welles the man. One learns of his sad early childhood, very reminiscent (crudely) of the childhood of the main character in Citizen Kane. His mother died when he was 9, his father was out of his life and he was raised at a boarding school as a result. He was also a child prodigy in terms of poetry, music and the arts. He started in the theater when he was only 16. He was extremely focused and lacked empathy. Perhaps that was the reason for his success. It was probably also responsible, unfortunately, for his many divorces and his inability to interact with others, particularly the moneyed in Hollywood that were so needed for financing. As a result he was unable to complete many, many of the films that he started.

The viewer also learns that he was an extremely dedicated and fixated on his craft and a workaholic (he died while working). Simultaneously, and ironically, he also had perspective with respect to his profession. He said, many times in his career, that he wished he could do more for humanity and being human transcended his profession. The documentary, unlike so many, is filled with pathos. It is not just a straight forward emotionless film.

The documentary is also very, very well researched with many clips from his many interviews and public appearances. In addition, there are many interviews, that provide valuable insights into the man, with co-stars, co-workers, fellow students, etc.

The one weakness of the film is that it does not delve into what really and truly made him the great artist that he was. That was the style of his art. In the whole (about) hour and a half of the documentary there is only one line on his film style  basically that he made original and unique use of lighting, camera movements and was able to get the most out of his actors (and himself when acting). A few more minutes and more specifics on these would have provided valuable insight into what truly made him one of the greatest filmmakers of the last centuries. In the documentary there are many interviews with film greats such as George Lucas, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg (among many others) describing how influential he was in the medium but, unfortunately, the viewer does not come away, knowing specifically why.",1433289600,6,2375,4.757281553398058
7011124,5,B00TJFXH02,"Orson Welles' father was a wealthy inventor, his mother a beautiful concert pianist. And Orson Welles was gifted. Very gifted. A child prodigy of legend, Welles became an actor, producer, and director. He would eventually excel in theater, radio, television, and film(his 1941 ""Citizen Kane"" is still a landmark). Oh, yes, and he was a magician. In 1956, he directed ""Touch of Evil"" for Universal. The studio didn't like it; they re-edited it, and it failed. ""Touch of Evil(finally released in 1958)"" did win a prize at the 1958 Brussels World Fair. Some call it one of the greatest films of all time. Welles was constantly acting in other people's movies to help him pay for his own personal films. As the years went by, most of his personal movie projects were left unfinished, or unreleased, due to financial problems, and disputes with studio executives. Welles' ""The Deep(1970)"" was never completed(damaging was the death of it's star, Laurence Harvey, during production). Welles' rarely seen ""The Merchant of Venice(1969)"" was never completed. Orson Welles began shooting Miguel de Cervantes classic book ""Don Quixote"" in 1955, with Francisco Reiguera as the hero, and Akim Tamiroff as Pancho. He shot here and there, when funds were available, and by the 1970's, it was still unfinished. The footage can be seen, and some of it is simply beautiful. Welles' cameraman, Jesse Franco, filmed an ending after Welles had passed on. A most interesting Hollywood satire, ""The Other Side of the Wind"", starred friend and director John Huston, and Peter Bogdanovich, who once let Orson Welles live in his house. Rumors swell that ""The Other Side of the Wind"" was completed, but post-production was not. Those rumors whisper that the film will soon be shown, but so far it has never been released. ""Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles"" directed by Chuck Workman, contains brief clips from almost every movie Welles ever directed, including, for the first time, ""Hearts of Age"", which Orson Welles directed at age 18 in just one day. Not alone, ""Magician"" contains quick cuts from all of Orson Welles elusive, unfinished projects, most locked away for years in tins in a Hollywood warehouse. ""Magician"" contains one scene from the 1968 TV movie, ""The Immortal Story"", which some critics rave about. ""The Immortal Story"" is otherwise unavailable. Director Workman includes a large collection of interviews, awards shows, and television presentations, with Welles in full form. At his favorite Hollywood restaurant, ""Ma Maison"", Welles could be found with his favorite dinner, two steaks cooked rare, and a pint of scotch whiskey. Never mind the desert.  ""Magician"" DVD also has a scene selection, and an interview with director Chuck Workman. The director is asked about a picture procession of beautiful women that appears half-way through the DVD(Lena Horn, Eartha Kitt, Dolores Del Rio, and more). He is asked: ""Were these lovers of Orson Welles?""....""Of course....""Orson Welles was once asked about his favorite directors. He said: ""I prefer the old masters; by which I mean John Ford, John Ford, and John Ford....""",1432771200,10,3134,5.145098039215687
7011125,2,B00TJFXH02,No captions. What's the problem Amazon? This happens on a regular basis. You advertise captions and their are none. My 85 year old uncle is hard of hearing and this is very frustrating.,1432598400,4,185,4.636363636363637
7011126,5,B00TJFXH02,"Magician was a amazing find at the theater, simply put. You go through this amazing journey of Welles life from high to low, rich to poor, creative to  creative. It will not disappoint, just like Orson Welles never disappoints as a thespian, radio personality, stage/television/film actor, writer, director, producer and all around giant of the man, on and off the screen. I guess what anyone can say about the man is that life was his stage, he would have done it all over again with or without the inventions of radio, film or television. Oh, one last thought, never knew this, Welles was the father or independent film, talk about mind blowing! You can't go wrong with this film, period.",1428192000,5,690,4.75
7011127,4,B00TJFXH02,"""Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles"" (2014 release; 94 min.) is a documentary about the genius of Orson Welles, 'enfant terrible' of the 1940s-50s Hollywood and godfather of the indie film makers. The movie opens, of course, with the opening scene from ""Citizen Kane"", where we see Welles whisper ""Rosebud"", but after that we get a straight-forward and chronological overview of Welles' life and work. The documentary is divided up in 5 chapters, covering different periods of his life (1915-1941 The Boy Wonder; 1942-1949 The Outsider, etc.). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from veteran documentary maker Chuck Workman. When I saw his name on this, I felt pretty sure that we'd be in for a great documentary. And it's certainly not a bad documentary. The movie hits all the major high (and low) lights of Welles' career (War of the Worlds; Citizen Kane; Touch of Evil; The Trial; Chimes at Midnight; etc.), and Workman compiles a treasure trove of old clips. He also interviews a bunch of people, including Peter Bogdanovich, Julie Taymor, Steven Spielberg, etc. Yet despite all that, the documentary seems to be missing something. Maybe it's because there is no true new insight or revelation, since yes, we do know that Welles was a genius who was misunderstood and/or difficult to work with. There are a couple of glimpses into Welles' personal life but the tidbit of information from that angle really doesn't add much (we are informed that one of Welles' two surviving daughters refused to cooperate in the making of this documentary). There are a number of great quotes sprinkled throughout the movie such as Orson's ""I like Hollywood very much, but Hollywood just doesn't like me much"", ha! or this one (about making Citizen Kane): ""it wasn't about the money, it was about control"". The timing of a wider release of this documentary is to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Orson Welles' birth.

This documentary opened recently without any pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Since I love documentaries and of course admire the genius of Orson Welles, I went to see it right away. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (it didn't help that midway through the movie, the fire alarm went off and we had to leave the theater temporarily). If you are new to Orson Welles, by all means take the opportunity to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray. You will be amazed. For those that are already familiar with Orson Welles, there's really nothing new in this documentary.",1426204800,33,2749,4.871794871794871

7011131,4,B00TJFXH02,"Over the course of about 90 minutes, I learned a lot about Mr. Welles that I never knew about, especially his childhood and growing up. I only came to know him from the 1939 broadcast of ""War of the Worlds.""

In another life, I worked in broadcasting and was employed by a station owned by CBS Inc. CBS Radio allowed the Mercury Radio Theater to broadcast on their network, including the ""WOTW"" broadcast. And as a result of that very broadcast, CBS Inc. continues to house THE largest legal department of ALL broadcasting networks in the world.

7011142,2,B00TJFXH02,"As a huge fan of Orson Welles, I was very disappointed by this brief documentary. Any documentary that intends to show the span of this brilliant man's 50 year career in radio, theater, television and movies would obviously need to be more than 90 minutes! This film is just a pile of snippets from other more in-depth interviews, and clips from Welles' movies. The great BBC interview with Welles from 1982 is snipped to bits here, cutting out much of what Welles and others had to say. This brief glimpse at Welles is frustrating and perplexing. It inexplicably cuts to fictional films that Welles had no involvement in, such as a few seconds of John Travolta in ""Get Shorty,"" and a chopped up scene from Truffaut's""Day for Night."" This movie really short changes Welles, and turns out to have been completely unnecessary because it skimps on new footage, and merely covers the same highlights as other, better docs already made about Welles (see ""The Orson Welles Story,"" BBC Arena 1982; and ""American Experience: The Battle Over Citizen Kane"", and ""Orson Welles, The One-Man Band"" 1995).",1472515200,,1091,4.902702702702703
7011143,3,B00TJFXH02,"Interesting film, but lacked continuity. Seemed disjointed. The movie was called Magician, I assume to praise his genius and many talents, but never explained the clips of him as an actual magician.",1471910400,,198,5.21875
7011144,4,B00TJFXH02,"Saw half of this on a transatlantic flight but we landed before I could finish seeing it so I was delighted to see that it was available on Prime Video.  Watched the whole movie the other night.  I did not know that much about Orson Welles (Citizen Kane and War of the Worlds was about it) so this documentary provided a lot more information about the man's entire career.  It was very enjoyable.  My only complaint is that it was hard to read some of the descriptions on the screen.  That is because it was often too faint (white on a light background) and it didn't last very long so it disappeared before I could finish reading it.  However, it is a great introduction to the man and I will probably read the Simon Callow biography and will definitely watch some of his movies.",1469491200,,780,4.381944444444445
7011145,4,B00TJFXH02,"Overall this a very well made biography of Orson Welles.  I will say that the film assumes that the viewer already has a general idea of who Welles was.

7011151,4,B00TJFXH02,"This film is a great overview of the life and works of Orson Wells, with gaps, of course, for no short film could ever capture the greatness of so controversial and innovative artist as Orson Wells, a true artistic magician.  Orson had his problems, which he readily admits in this film, and like him or hate him, he was an artistic genius.  So, take it all round, if you are a fan of cinema, if you are a student of cinematic innovations and an artist's impact on films to this date, if you like movies and have no idea about the significance of the word ""Rosebud"", then perhaps, unless you are involved with a ""War of the Worlds"" on some evening or late afternoon, then perhaps you should watch ""Magician"".  No legerdemain here.  If you are interested in the history of cinema and great artists who have made monumental impacts on the film industry, an industry that did not appreciate one of the great contributors who shaped its future, then tune in one last time to one of the creators of the Mercury Theater, a scary Halloween night indeed, but a most informative night, yes....",1463097600,,1084,4.543589743589743

7011161,3,B00TJFXH02,"An entertaining once-over-lightly treatment highly recommended for newcomers. Those already familiar with Welles' life and work will find little that's new or enlightening. The movie's outlook is as uncritical as you can possibly be. Not all of Welles' difficulties were of his own making, and it's a failure of Hollywood that it was unwilling to indulge him as much as it could have. Nevertheless, in the end all an artist can do is put his work in a condition for people to experience it, and this is something that Welles failed to do again and again, to a great degree because his lack of discipline. Robert Altman, to take an example, was a far less talented filmmaker, but he got his movies made. To those who already know the essentials of his life story, the documentary One Man Band (a bonus feature on the Criterion Collection edition of F for Fake) is a much more illuminating look at his later career.",1455580800,,913,4.6770186335403725

To also follow his difficulties over his life in film making and the adversity he had to deal with in Hollywood over most of his career really surprised me. This talented man was not really ever wealthy or famous during his time, but his ability to pour his heart and soul into his films as a director were great inspirations to film makers even today. He literally was one of the forefathers of great Indy pictures we see today.

7011244,4,B00TJFXH02,"This is a fascinating look at a creative genius who was ahead of his time.  Wells was a prodigy who moved from stage to radio to film, finding the latter the best outlet for his ideas.  Shunned by the big studios, in part because he dared to produce Citizen Cane, now widely considered the best movie ever made, which told an unflattering story that was too close to biographical for William R. Hearst, the powerful publishing magnate, As a result, Wells was always short of money to make his movies.

The best measure of his impact is told in the interviews with many top movie makers who all point to techniques that he was first to use that have been copied in many of the best movies of the 20th century and beyond.  He was literally 40 years ahead of his time!  Unfortunately, many of his movies were lost or never finished, leaving us with teasing glimpses of what might have been had he been properly funded.  I wonder what he would have done had he had a patron with deep pockets.",1445040000,,988,4.4010989010989015

But he utterly destroyed his chances of a successful career by deliberately taking on and impugning the character of William Randolph Hearst, the obvious subject of that movie, and one of the richest men in America. Could Welles have done as well with another subject? Probably. He was headstrong, not a bad thing in a director, but willfully ignorant of the risks. This movie does a good job of showing us what Welles did with his time after Citizen Kane, including some of his subsequent successes (The Third Man, The Magnificent Ambersons, A Touch of Evil) as well as his unfinished exploration of Shakespeare on film. Not the best biography, but worth a look if you are a fan.",1443398400,,833,4.673469387755102

If you have any interest at all in the remarkable career of one of the cinema's finest, you can't go wrong on this production.

7011308,3,B00TJFXH02,"Bit disappointing really. I hate to criticize as it is awesome that someone has taken the time to recognize a great pioneer but the phrase hagiography is what kept coming to mind. Not that I wanted or expected some trashing expose, it's just that in a way it just seemed a bit pedestrian. I did appreciate all the interviews particularly with those who knew Welles when he was attending a boys school in small town Illinois but i walked away not really having a feel for the man. Perhaps all the good interviews had already been used elsewhere?....And the music was a bit off as well. But I'm giving this three stars for including footage of never before seen lost/unfinished films of Welles.",1442102400,,692,4.634146341463414

7011319,3,B00TJFXH02,"Brought to you by Chuck Workman, the worlds most famous editor thanks to his Who Died this Year and Time Filler Film Montage videos from the Oscars, Magician is kind of hit or miss. If you're a fan of Orson Welles and know his films, then this plays like a Greatest Hits reel with a few surprises later on. If youve never heard of Orson Welles, Id suggest that you seek out his films first. This bio-doc won't really give you much.

Everything feels like a flip-card version of Welles life until nearly the end. This is the only point in which Workmans editing genius shines through, and we begin to get a contradictory narrative from the man himself, in which he replies to the same question with wildly differing answers which roughly correspond to the biographical eras defined in the film.

If only Workman could have pulled this off throughout the entire movie, in which one of Americas most brilliant and yet most maligned directors reveals the complexity of his personality (and had taken more time to do it) this could have been the Citizen Kane of documentaries.

Unfortunately, its not. But if you have any interest in film history at all, this is still worth a watch at least for the extended glimpses at Welless lost films Don Quixote and Chimes at Midnight. No... wait: despite the weakness of around it, these clips make this film more than worth it to Welles fans.",1441929600,2,1379,4.6204081632653065

7011335,4,B00TJFXH02,"A different perspective. This biography doesn't just dwell on Welles' great successes, but paints a fuller picture of the man and his work. I was struck by the similarities between Welles and Frank Lloyd Wright, another man whose work I admire, but whose personal life left scars on others around them.

The worts are not covered over. So many unfinished works, many succumbing to ideology. I suppose Welles intended to complete projects and begin others, only to have death get in the way. In reality, genius is not always an explanation for a man's shortcomings.

Citizen Kane is the most lasting thing from his career - I wondered why he never achieved it again. Very little time was devoted to the most astonishing thing he did - the radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds. I might have preferred an in depth look at some of those highlights when he was at his very best.,1441152000,,647,4.225806451612903

7011374,4,B00TJFXH02,"A glimpse into genius that we will likely never see again in our lifetimes, this documentary hits most of the highs & lows of Welles' legendary career. It is a joy to watch & experience.

What is most enjoyable about it is watching & listening to Welles himself, with numerous clips from interviews, talk shows, & his films, both as director and actor. It could have included more because in this case, ""more is more"" is most appropriate here, & that's why it's 4 stars instead of 5 for me; I found myself remembering bits & pieces of Barbara Leaming's 1985 biography of Welles, which came out the year he died.  I recall enjoying reading it immensely, & if you haven't read it, it would be a great addition to watching this documentary. In fact, I may have to read it again after watching this.

Welles was simply an artistic prodigy comfortable in all media forms, from the stage, to radio, to film, to television. I admit never having thought of him as an independent film maker previously; however, as this documentary points out, that's absolutely what he was, & the films which haven't been tampered with as much as ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" stand the test of time: They are ahead of their times, & today, they seem oddly vintage & modern simultaneously.

One of my all-time favorite films from childhood forward is ""Jane Eyre"" with him in the lead role; indeed, as I studied English Literature in college, I couldn't read it without imagining Edward Rochester as Orson Welles. Somehow, I had either forgotten about or never knew about ""Chimes at Midnight"" his Shakespearean tour-de-force featuring one of the greatest characters of all time, Sir John Falstaff. From the clips shown in this documentary, it appears that Welles is completely immersed in the role of Falstaff, & it looks like a fantastic filmed version of Shakespeare's historical plays about Henry IV. I can hardly wait to order it & watch it!

That's one of the tidbits I recall from Leaming's biography---that Welles' notebooks on Shakespeare plays were ""adapted"" to whatever medium he was working in at the time, be it radio, live theatre, or film. Welles could easily transpose scenes to fit the action required without losing any of the subtleties---a twentieth-century master adapting the works of the Renaissance master with ease, as though a child at play.",1440979200,2,2338,4.849624060150376

So much goes by so quickly with little or no explanation that you end up with little understanding of what happened.  Welles was an incredibly gifted man and I'm really glad to see a documentary being made about him, but this just leaves too much to be desired.  It's often more caught in in clever editing than in a coherent narrative.  It's a shame really, because much of the footage that the film makers have come up with is wonderful, but time and again you're left wondering just what you're looking at.  Even an old fashioned narrator would help a lot.

Worth checking out, but Orson deserves a far more in-depth treatment.",1439856000,2,728,4.519083969465649

Ultimately, the flick was merely a tease (like Workman's work for Disney parks): always a treat to watch Welles hold court, but these ""Orson talking head"" shots were ancient; likewise we get into Ambersons butchering, with Robert Wise, no less, then off to something else. Not enough about his last narrative film with Jeanne Moreau, nor ""The Other Side of the Wind"" with Oja Kodar. Not enough Bogdanovich, and any Jaglom is probably too much.
Not an ""F for Fake"" by any stretch, but a solid C+. Just glad I didn't rush into San Francisco for its limited cinematic run.",1439856000,,622,4.663636363636364

Of course, there is a good reason for this: many of his projects were unfinished, and others are tied up in litigation. Interestingly, they position him as an ""indie"" which is certainly relevant in the current writing environment! This documentary shows many sides of Welles that I haven't seen before, interjected with short clips from several interviews. However, I found it very choppy and had a hard time following their narrative; although the show was broken up into chronological sections, they seemed to jump around and I found that the pieces didn't tie together very well.

Full of dramatic interviews with Orson Welles and people who knew him well. The documentary manages to show the evolution of the artist Orson Welles, and stipulates that had Orson Welles lived in these days, he would have been an indie film maker. I stipulate that hed have 1-5 million followers on twitter and could easily get his films financed via crowd funding.

The most remarkable elements are the many segments from unfinished movies. Even though I majored in film and mass media and have combed film-o-theks, and attended plenty of art film festivals, I have never seen this material.

Just wonderful, highly recommended to anybody who is interested in the arts. 5 stars.

Naturally, trying to squish a genius this flawed into 95 minutes will not satisfy people who worship him for his body of work, but there does need to be an overview and this does the job as well as I could imagine.  The real purpose of this documentary should be to make the viewer either re-watch Welles' works or to seek them out for exploration.  My five star review is based on the fact that this leaves you wanting more, and that is a good thing when it comes to Orson Welles.  Plus, it doesn't shy away from the problems Orson had, both from the outside and self-inflicted, but it doesn't dwell on it too much.

Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles looks at the remarkable genius of Orson Welles on the eve of his centenary - the enigma of his career as a Hollywood star, a Hollywood director (for some a Hollywood failure), and a crucially important independent filmmaker.

Orson Welles's life was magical: a musical prodigy at age 10, a director of Shakespeare at 14, a painter at 16, a star of stage and radio at 20, romances with some of the most beautiful women in the world, including Rita Hayworth. His work was similarly extraordinary, most notably Citizen Kane (considered by many to be the most important movie ever made), created by Orson Welles when he was only 25.

In the years following Citizen Kane, Orson Welles career continued to change as he made film after film (some never finished, many dismissed) and acted in other projects, often to earn money in order to keep making his own films.

Magician features scenes from almost every exciting Orson Welles films, from Hearts of Ages (which he made in a day when he was on 18 years of age) to rarely-seen clips from his final unfinished works like The Other Side of the Dream, The Deep and Don Quixote, as well as his television and commercial work.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Commemorating the 100th anniversary of his birth, this captivating biography examines the remarkable genius of Orson Welles and the enigma of his larger than life career as a Hollywood star, a Hollywood director and for some a Hollywood failure, and a crucially important independent filmmaker.

Like one of those machines that can inhale a car and spit out a tidy cube of squashed components, 'Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles' is a near-indigestible lump of clips and quips and snipped opinions. Assembled chronologically and delivered at warp speed and theres enough astonishment here for the duration of 91 minutes running time, and this is a very substantial potted history of one of our rarest and astonishing moviemaking talents offers nothing new for fans and seems likely to overwhelm the uninitiated.

The extraordinary tale of how a precocious prodigy from Wisconsin caused a stir in the worlds of theatre, radio and cinema all before his 26th birthday, then spent the rest of his life trying to live up to his own reputation. In the process, he found himself stymied as much by distrustful studios and reluctant funders as by his own stubborn unwillingness to compromise the artistic vision which, today, is seen as possessed of an unfailing foresight.

This is a real tour-de-force, as well as an in-depth study of Orson Welles' singular life and career would run the length of a miniseries, but Chuck Workman engagingly hits a good many highlights in stone-skipping fashion in Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles. Additionally, by delving into the protean talent's bag of unfinished projects, the veteran documentary and clips-reel whiz tries to counter the view that Welles had a fear of completion later in life; as the film shows, he was always working, and however under-financed he may have been. Premiered in a near-finished version at Telluride, this energetic, fast-moving portrait is a natural for festivals, specialty cinema venues internationally, TV and home formats.

Chuck Workman's strengths as a miner of archives really pays off here, as he offers up exceedingly rare documentary footage of his subject drawn from diverse international sources, peeks at unfinished works and camera tests Orson Welles himself shot and often unfamiliar excerpts from old but relevant interviews with figures no longer with us (see Cast List above).

A straightforward, chronological approach in chaptered form starts with 1915-1941: The Boy Wonder, charting Orson Welles eccentric, transient childhood, and the thirst for artistic expression that led to adventuresome stage triumphs (like the all-black Voodoo Macbeth) in his early 1920s. He also became a highly popular radio actor (notably as voice of The Shadow on that mystery serial), and it was in that medium that he became infamous via the 1938 Halloween broadcast of H.G. Welles Martian-invasion fantasy The War of the Worlds. Dramatised in fake-newscast form, it panicked some gullible listeners (though some argue the extent of that reaction was greatly exaggerated). Thus began decades alternating lucrative (if often trivial) acting gigs with erratic directorial work, the latter often plagued by budgetary woes or front-office interference. Even his moneymaking 1946 thriller The Stranger, couldn't shake his rep for extravagance, unreliability and inconsistency with popular taste.

The film briskly reveals how young Orson Welles was recognised as an artistic prodigy from the earliest age and how, his parents both dead and disliking his guardian, he found his metier and love of Shakespeare at the Todd School in Woodstock in his early teens before leaving for Ireland and bluffing his way into his first professional appearances. His Todd school mentor Roger Hill's daughter Jane offers the telling insight that the young Orson had ""no empathetic skills,"" while Orson Welles daughter Beatrice expresses with chagrin that, ""Having wives and daughters was actually an encumbrance for him."" On top of all that Orson Welles' meteoric rise in the 1930s with the Federal and then the Mercury Theater, as well as on radio, is colourfully rendered via plentiful stills and newsreels footage, an array of experts including surviving participant Norman Lloyd, as well as clips from Richard Linklater's fine feature Me and Orson Welles, with the remarkable Christian McKay in the pivotal role.

Such notoriety brought Hollywood offers; Orson Welles held out until RKOs terms gave him virtual carte blanche. Though his initial plan to adapt Conrads Heart of Darkness was scuttled as too expensive and risky, Citizen Kane was scarcely less so and not least for being so blatantly inspired by the life of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, who used his considerable might to thwart its success. (Though, as one observer points out here, the film was just as much a critical self-portrait for Orson Welles.) As a result, RKO was all too happy to seize the post-production reins on The Magnificent Ambersons when Orson Welles blithely decamped to South America for the abortive Its All True. The sadly compromised if still brilliant result proved another box office failure, ending his cinematic honeymoon.

Spending most of the next decade in Europe, Welles made Othello, the first of several projects that were shot piecemeal whenever funding became available. He considered two late masterpieces, The Trial and Chimes at Midnight, and his personal best, but sadly they also flopped. Several other projects Don Quixote and The Merchant of Venice and the improvised The Other Side of the Wind never neared completion. Some have been or will be released in posthumously constructed form; its noted that several titles, including Chimes at Midnight remain in legal contention. Meanwhile, his slightly embarrassing career as a public bon vivant flourished is represented via clips from I Love Lucy, The Muppet Show, and a myriad talk shows and commercials.

In addition to much archival input from Orson Welles himself and always willing to talk about himself, albeit sometimes via tall tales like in Magician and draws on many commentators living or who has passed away. The latter includes such co-workers as Charlton Heston, Robert Wise and John Houseman. The former range from biographers, critics and relatives to present-day helmers still in awe of his influence. Richard Linklater calls him the patron saint of indie filmmakers. Among those extensively tapped are his close friend Peter Bogdanovich and his final long-term companion, Oja Kodar. One fleeting portrait montage provides a glimpse of the many famous, beautiful women Orson Welles was involved with. The closing mention of a feud between two of Orson Welles daughters hints at rich dramatic potential in the messy legacy of legal and personal conflicts, still roiling three decades after his death.

In an initially amusing device, Chuck Workman inserts clips from variably worthwhile movies in which Orson Welles is portrayed in Radio Days, Heavenly Creatures and extending it to films that simply reference him in  Day for Night and Get Shorty.

Conversely, the unfinished film Orson Welles toiled on through the 1970s, The Other Side of the Wind, gets surprisingly short shrift, even though there are plenty of people still around who worked on it and could have provided first-hand accounts of its erratic, start-and-stop making and analysis of why it was never completed.

There are 12 chapters in all in this film documentary and they are as follows: The Boy Wonder; Stage Craft; War of the Worlds; RKO; Citizen Kane; The Outsider; Women; The Gypsy;  The Road Back; The Trial; F for Fake; End Credits.

Finally, it is a very breezy and very analytical look at the genius of Orson Welles and prone to leaving a psychological evaluation of this enormously complex figure, mostly to the side, Magician adopts a lively, energetic approach in the worthy service of engaging the interest of viewers perhaps unfamiliar with Welles' life and work. Such a result would be all to the good for an artist about whom there are always more aspects to discover and perspectives to be shared. But the revelations aren't pursued, leaving the man whom the actress Jeanne Moreau beautifully pronounces a destitute king perched on his throne. If, as he claimed, he aspired to make movies for something except entertainment, what that might have been remains anyones guess.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles is presented on this stunning awesome Blu-ray courtesy of Cohen Media Group with an even more awesome stunning 1080p encoded image transfer, which has varied selection of aspect ratios, but with the main one is the 1.85:1 aspect ratio. With the archival interviews are varied, with some elements taken from several television videos with having various anomalies like some ghosting displayed. Some Older filmed interviews, especially from the BBC fare a bit better at times, though can look sometimes soft when compared to the newer interview segments. Film clips look generally very good to excellent, while some on the backstage footage of theatrical outings is relatively not so good looking images. But despite this, this is still truly a wonderful stunning image, especially the 2014 sections that radiate brilliant stunning colourful images you will ever view.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Audio gives the option of a 5.1 DTS-HD Master surround and a simple 5.1 Dolby Digital. There are a few separations, but the film clips are mostly flat and from the centre channel. There is some music beyond those used in the film clips - classical and played beyond the clips into the narration, for example Burt Bacharach via Herb Alpert's 'Casino Royale' and the score can add to the gaps in the dialogue. Music and effects remained background elements to a substantial degree, but they seemed well-reproduced and clear. Ultimately, the audio of Magician suited the documentary film very well.

Special Feature: A Conversation with Director Chuck Workman [2014] [1080p] [1.85:1] [8:58] After the titles have finished, sitting in front of the camera, in a private viewing cinema, we find Chuck Workman [Director] and Annette Insdorf [Director of Undergraduate Film Studies of Columbia University] who does the interview, and Annette asks Chuck in wanting to know what was Orson Welles greatest achievement and Chuck replies that Orson Welles said, that I am just warming up and that he was married to film, as well loving film. Annette points out to Chuck at one particular part of his film documentary, that he shows Orson Welles talking about Citizen Kane, that he had the confidence of ignorance, but in turn makes him a genius. Chuck also felt that Orson Welles was not understood, but he was definitely of an era of progressives and liberals. Annette also says to Chuck that his film documentary presents a man with tremendous appetite in all respects and asks the question about the heart shaped picture frames of all the beautiful women and also asks if all those women were Orson Welles lovers, and chuck says with one word supposedly. Chuck also informs us to make this special documentary of Orson Welles; he had to view all of Orson Welles films and out of all the films he viewed, and the one he loved the best was a Touch of Evil. Chuck declares that Orson Welles gave so much more, and more than we may have thought and as much as we love Citizen Kane and his other films of his, there was so much more and was such a master of cinema and we can look at it, and look at it again and learn so much from it and at the time they filmed this special, Chuck declares that it was the 100th anniversary of Orson Welles and people are starting to look at his films again and he finally declares that the world has finally caught up, so now they can see what Orson Welles has done with sets, with music, with lighting and with soundtrack. And now we come to the of this very short special, but I leave the last words to Chuck Workman, where he says, Orson Welles said he was lucky to do this job, I have my problems, I recognise them, and said lets go to dinner and Chuck also tells us that basically Orson Welles attitude was for show and that he was happy to be Orson Welles and we were lucky to have him. All in all this is a nice look at Cuck Workman and his feelings towards Orson Welles and why he did this special documentary film and it is such a shame it is so short, as I would of loved to hear more from Chuck Workman, as he is a very interesting intelligent person. But boy oh boy, the only negative aspect of this special, is they I hated and detested Annette Insdorf, as she is the most pompous and pretentious egotistic person I have ever encountered on this planet of ours.

Theatrical Trailer [2014] [1080p] [1.65:1] [2:04] This is a totally brilliant trailer, that gives a great impression on the life and times of Orson Welles, especially by the brilliant director Chuck Workman and shows you why Orson Welles was such a genius, ahead of his time, which is now only just being recognised.

Cohen Sneak Peak Blu-ray Releases: DELI MAN [2014] [1080p] [1.85:1] [2:16]; TIBUKTU [2014] [1080p] [1.66:1] [1:54]; IN THE NAME OF MY DAUGHTER [2014] [1080p] [1.85:1] [2:08]; JAMAICA INN [1939] [1080p] [1.37:1] [5:30]

Finally, Is Magician exhaustive? No, it is very comprehensive and 91 minutes, Chuck Workman's documentary film will leave Orson Welles fans salivating for more or perhaps even shrugging, given that Magician has, when it comes down to it, little new to say or offer. And yet, in a forgettable Hollywood culture of reboots and remakes and recasting, Chuck Workman has done a brilliant professional service in making a broadly accessible history of Orson Welles that stands a chance of drawing younger generations of film buffs, like moths, to the masters flame. In that way, and in teasing, Magician functions as a sort of preview of coming attractions lying in wait for new and old Orson Welles fans to discover. As Orson Welles famously and accurately predicted, God, how they'll love me when I'm dead. So all in all this is a totally brilliant film documentary of a total genius filmmaker and if you are a fan of Orson Welles, you will love this Blu-ray disc and if you feel that other people should find out about this genius that they are missing out and especially informing about his brilliant film, then you should tell as many people about this fantastic brilliant film documentary about Orson Wells, as they will not be let down. Highly Recommended!

7011595,5,B00TJFXH02,"This Bluray release from the ""Cohen Film Collection"" - a company that, like Criterion, is restoring classic films but, unlike Criterion, is releasing new film history documentaries - tries the impossible by attempting to cover Orson Welles film career in just 94 minutes. But, then again, the Director/Editor Chuck Workman, is the guy who does those ""In Memoriam"" compilations and ""The year In Film in 90 seconds"" compilations that they show on the Academy Awards telecasts. Workman is a wonderful editor and I loved the ""What is Cinema?"" documentary he made for Cohen last year.

No this is not a ""film course"" on Welles. It couldn't be at this length. But it will wet the appetite for those who only know Welles from his major films as a director (""Citizen Kane""  ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" and ""The Stranger"") or as an Actor (""The Third Man"") and encourage them to seek out the available films. It will also probably frustrate classic film fans that there are many ""unfinished"" Welles productions (whose fragments are included here thanks to his widow). Workman uses excerpts from various Welles TV talk-show appearances (Cavett, Carson, and the BBC) including one that was recorded literally hours before he died. So Welles tells much of his own stories. In lie of a narrator, Workman uses on-screen text to fill in some additional facts. There are also clips from two major studio biopics on Welles. There was also a stage play ""Orson's Shadow"" that I've seen (twice!) but is never mentioned.

Recent interviewees include his biographer, film historians, directors like Steven Spielberg, Peter Bogdonovich, Julie Taymor and archival interviews by radio director Norman Corwin and actor John Houseman. We hear from Welles' oldest daughter, and even a school classmate.

The film was produced in 2014 and - for the BD Cohen added an eight-minute ""conversation with Chuck Workman"" which adds some info, but not much, and is filled with film clips that are already in the documentary.

So, I'm giving this five stars because I enjoyed it a lot. I've seen many of Welles major movies - but I did learn a lot from Workman's film and certainly felt it worth the 94 minutes I spent watching it.

The BD comes packaged with an eight page booklet comprised of black and white photos and an ""index"" to the 12 chapters on the disc.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8702039,4,B00TJFXH02,"Orson Welles was ahead of his time and the greatest independent filmmaker.

For someone who wants to get an overview of Orson Welles' cinematic works, this filmography should satisfy.  While Welles' early life is covered briefly, most of the documentary is snippets of his works and interviews he has held over the years.  Other directors and peers also talk about Welles.  He clearly was a talent ahead of his times.

The documentary is divided into five parts: 1915-1941 The Boy Wonder, 1942-1949 The Outsider, 1949-1957 The Gypsy, 1958-1966 The Road Back, 1966-1985 The Master.  He could speak Italian and German.

The only thing I didn't care for was the loud music. The music in his movies can be overbearingly loud because you want to listen to the person talking.  While his daughters and ex-wife Rita Hayworth are mentioned, not much else is revealed about his private life.

Welles comes off as self-confident and at times arrogant. But he was also a perfectionist.  His big passion was directing movies  His nontraditional ways of incorporating lighting, music, camera angles made him unHollywood like.  He had trouble getting funding so he funded his own movies, but in the end died with several unfinished movies.

Welles' attitudes about women, blacks, Hollywood were all ahead of his time.  He was a progressive all his life and proud of it, but he seems to have been shunned later on in life by Hollywood.

This would be an interesting summary of the great director if there were more people talking about Welles rather than the movies speaking for him.",1501027200,2,1568,4.931297709923665
8702040,4,B00TJFXH02,"I really enjoyed this documentary, which spans Welles' entire life from his high school theater days to his final televised interview.  Luckily, it gives equal attention to every film in his filmography instead of giving them the short shrift to Citizen Kane.  Besides studying his film directing career, it also delves into his work as a professional theater director, character actor and his lust for life, i.e. his hearty appetite and several romantic relationships.  Since this documentary made me want to watch the Welles films I haven't seen yet and everything I've already seen again, those who don't know his work at all are bound to enjoy this as much as those who already know everything about the man.",1496880000,,712,4.966386554621849
8702041,2,B00TJFXH02,"The movie was presumably a ""quickie"" meant for the centenary of Orson Welles's 1915 birth. It goes superficially over Welles's life and work, and a number of people who have interacted with or call him a strong influence are interviewed. But basically this documentary says a lot without teaching much.

It starts with describing Welles's childhood and his broken home, how he was a child genius who could do a lot of intellectual (but not athletic) things, how he ended up getting into Hollywood and cinema, as well as stage acting, and how he kept starting a bunch of movies but never finishing them, how he kept getting into trouble over creative control and financing, and how he became a legend despite all his troubles and comparatively thin body of finished work.

Yet you ultimately find out little about Welles. His chaotic family life is not really covered, nor the reason he could not discipline himself enough to complete more work, nor why at the end of his life he went into decline with self-parody. His trouble with Hearst over ""Citizen Kane"" is not even mentioned. Interesting only as the most basic of introductions to Orson Welles.",1492992000,,1150,4.83248730964467
