8487091,4,B005UQU1I0,"I grew up near the place where this documentary takes place. Its been an urban legend since I was a freshman in highschool. Although there are parts in this film that make it hard to watch like some of the bad acting in the re-enactment scenes, but where it makes up is the incredible history about Caryville and the supposed hauntings. The narrative is done really well by all narrators, and the cinematograhy was done very well. You have to understand, this movie was made by locals from the area and with that in mind, I think they did a very good job. This is a very independent documentary and with that in mind, I think its worth it. I learned a lot about Caryville from this documentary, if you know about this town and are interested in the Caryville hauntings, then you should definately check it out. I could see this film being on Netflix streaming.",1327449600,,860,4.484076433121019
8487092,2,B005UQU1I0,"I should have known.  Only one review for this DVD and they called it a 'masterpiece'.  What was I thinking??  This was boring.  The film is terrible to look at, cheaply made, terrible actors, and not scary.  I want my money back!  Never trust a film that has only one review with five stars.  Wait until you read more reviews from sane people about what they think of it.  I would have given it one star, but it was well researched, so I'm giving it two stars.  But skip it anyway.  Believe me, I was born in Wisconsin, there ain't nothing going on up there worth making a DVD about.  Except for Ed Gein, but even that was 40 years ago.  This film did put me to sleep, so I'm grateful for that.  Guaranteed to give you a good night's rest.  Maybe I should have given it three stars for that?",1320451200,3,792,4.158940397350993
8487093,5,B005UQU1I0,"This documentary takes you on a journey through one of the most haunted spots in Wisconsin. The history presented is well researched, the cinemaphotography is awesome, and the narrators present the material well. Well worth watching, no matter where you live (muahahahaha....)",1318464000,,276,5.595238095238095
