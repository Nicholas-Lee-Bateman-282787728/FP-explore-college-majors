2860078,5,B000R7I3Y6,This movie is highly under rated. I ran across this show on tv and was hooked. It's funny and it's made for the whole family. Ned Bigby and his two friends Cookie and Moze have a bunch of mishaps while on a school field trip (that they were banned from). This dvd also includes 2 episodes from the show. I just love this show!!! I can't wait to get the first season on dvd.,1237680000,2,373,4.054054054054054
2860079,5,B000R7I3Y6,"Absolutely brilliant. If you like the TV show Neds Declassified School Survival Guide, you'll love this movie (although it is less than an hour long) episode of it. Ned's class go on a school trip to some gardens, while Gordy, the psychic lunch lady and the other teachers stay at school to try and catch that weasle once and for all.

As the movie starts the bus for the school trip leaves in 15 minutes and Cookie has forgotten to get his permission slip signed. Unfortunatly Ned and Mose also get banned from the trip when they are caught helping Cookie to sneak on the trip. The three manage to get on the bus but must spend the trip avoiding Crubbs the vice principal who is determined to catch them.

Really brilliant movie, which is even better than any of the episodes - funny and ith lots of twists and turns in the story - will Ned, Cookie and Mose manage to avoid the teacher and have fun on the trip? Will Ned manage to meet up with Suzy Crabgrass for a kiss in the rose gardens at the end as planned? Will we find out how the love triangle between Ned Bigby, Jennifer Mosely and Suzy Crabgrass ends? Watch it and find out.",1237593600,,1135,4.299065420560748

2860081,5,B000R7I3Y6,"this item is awesome i would totally reccommed this item for any big fan of this show and it is very good plus it comes with a book.
its like the defining moment of the show and its purpose.",1209340800,4,190,3.8974358974358974
2860082,5,B000R7I3Y6,"I too am an adult (are there any teens who have reviewed this?). I had seen bits and pieces of the show on Nickelodeon over the last couple of years but only recently had I watched closely enough to begin appreciating it. However, it was not until they aired this episode that I truly sat down and watched it. I was hooked...imagine my dismay when I realized that this was the last episode of the series. I immediately began recording all of the episodes off Nickelodeon and watching them...out of order. I believe I have seen them all now (with the exception of the first three or four that were the pilot episodes). I would really love to have a complete series DVD to be able to go back and watch from the beginning, in order. At any rate, this episode is definitely worth getting...but I will probably hold out for all or nothing.",1200182400,4,834,4.422077922077922
2860083,5,B000R7I3Y6,"I couldn't help but write something for this show.  I haven't bought the DVD, . . .

I'm hoping for a full series DVD.

I'm, also, an adult . . . But, I could be considered a ""Big Kid.""

Even though the show is geared towards children, it's not close to being immature or childish.

I think this is basic new school ideas for teens that may be growing up fast or that may have wisdom beyond their age.

So, if you're looking to give your child something encouraging to watch while keeping them happy or entertained, . . give them this gift.  Though, this is the finale and some background into the characters may be helpful.

Nickelodeon is slightly similar to Disney, although their humor and cartoons can be slighty edgier at times.

Other Nicktoons of note, that fly under the radar, are Jimmy Neutron, Fairly Oddparents, and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

2860084,4,B000R7I3Y6,"This episode deserves a 5-star rating, but I was disappointed in the extras.  As the final(?) episode in the ""Ned's Declassified"" series, I would have much preferred to have seen the episodes that immediately preceded it rather than two essentially random (although failry good) episodes (""Dismissal"" and ""The School Play"").  Unlike many shows with a myriad of writers, directors, and topics, ""Ned's Declassified"" maintained excellent continuity and releasing the final episode without the shows that set the stage is a crime of omission.

To summarize the main feature without spoiling it, the Polk Middle School 8th grade class are scheduled to embark on a field trip to the Huffington Gallery, where Ned has planned a romantic afternoon in the Rose Garden with newly-returned girlfriend Suzie Crabgrass.  In the meantime, Moze has decided that Suzie's return is a sign that she and Ned were not meant to be, and Cookie has hatched a new scheme to win Lisa Zemo as the masked hero the Steel Eagle.  When Cookie forgets his permission slip for the field trip and Ned's plan to help him backfires, Vice Principal Crubbs consigns Ned, Cookie, and Moze to the no-goers room.  Never at a loss for a plan (and with Gordy the janitor's help) the crew sneak onto the bus but fate seems determined to continually foil Ned's romantic rendezvous with Suzie, Moze's desire to see the gallery's famous ""Wild Boy"" painting, and Cookie's plan to impress Lisa as the Steel Eagle.  Will Ned finally get the girl he wants?  Will Moze see the ""Wild Boy""?  Will Cookie finally be a hero in Lisa's eyes?  Will Gordy finally catch the wily weasel?  And will Crubbs catch them all?  The answers are: yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes...but you'll have to watch this DVD to get the full story.",1196035200,2,1765,4.827242524916944
2860085,2,B000R7I3Y6,"First off-- the pages are out of order and even repeated.  How they could sell a book like this is beyond belief.  Go to a bookstore to check out the book first (Cookie's page is repeated by Moze's profie as if she were a volleyball/compuetr geek!!)  Other than that is as if Ned published a ""Letterman"" top 10 list based on facts from the show...",1190937600,,347,4.3076923076923075
2860086,5,B000R7I3Y6,"This is the last episode (a double-episode actually) of Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide that first aired on June 8, 2007.

Like the rest of the series, this is a light-hearted look at middle-school through the eyes of Ned, Cookie, and Moze. The class goes on a field trip to the fictional Huffington Library and most of the story takes place on location -- a first for the series and a nice change. (Though the library is based on Huntington Gardens in Pasadena, CA, the episode was actually shot at Descanso Gardens in La Caada Flintridge, CA.)

Does Ned end up with Suzy or Moze? You'll have to tune in to find out but, its worth the wait.",1187740800,11,650,4.5
