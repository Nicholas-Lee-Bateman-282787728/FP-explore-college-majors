8602982,4,B00E9HSZFW,"While Lon Caney looks quite terrifying in this 1925 silent film and has a sinister grin on his face throughout the 91-minute film, and although it is called The Monster, this film is actually a comedy. It is about a bumbling not too bright young man who took a correspondence course to become a detective and receives a diploma indicating he graduated with some articles he can now use in his new profession including a gun and manacles. The locals mock him. He is in love with a girl but has a rival who looks much more sophisticated than him and who has a car. The girl goes off with the rival and gets caught by a crazed doctor. He wanders around and falls into the place where his gal and rival have been taken.
The place is an asylum run by a doctor who has disappeared. We and the trio that stumbled into the sanitarium learn that the inmates have taken over the place and are following the dictates of an acclaimed doctor who is a patient because he has gone mad. He and the other inmates have captured the doctor who runs the institution and imprisoned them. This mad doctor is convinced that he can transfer the soul of one person into another person. Using a huge mirror, he captures people because the mirror causes them to think that a car is coming against them, they crash and the mad doctor imprisons them. He has not yet experimented with his captives because all of them are men, and he is convinced that he needs a girl for the experiment. Now he has one, the one our hero is infatuated with.
Our hero bumbles his way to capturing the villains and wins the girl who is impressed with his brilliance.
The film is fun to watch.",1502323200,,1643,4.355048859934853

8602985,5,B00E9HSZFW,"I purchased this film as a horror film buff but didn't know anything about Johnny Arthur until a search around the web.  Having viewed the film, I think Arthur (at least in  this case) may have gotten a bad rap as being described as ""the gay Stepin Fetchit.""  Quit frankly, he was the only thing that kept the movie fresh, and from at least seeing this film, I enjoyed it from a gay perspective...
The Monster could probably stand to be a gay classic as Johnny Arthur rips the movie out from under Lon Chaney and runs with it.  As Johnny Goodlittle, an adorable twinkie who wants to be a detective but has nothing but derision from the people around him.  His BFF Betty is in like with his pretentious boss, he works in a dead end retail gig, and when he aspires to solve a missing persons case, he is jeered by the town fathers.  As the story moves along, Johnny finds himself trapped in an old dark house with Betty and his boss, who is too busy pretending to be the hero for Betty than actually figuring out what is going on.  As Johnny bumbles further and further into the labyrinthine house to find a way out, he has to use his ""ingenuity"" to get to the heart of the matter.  Let's just say where ingenuity goes courage soon follows, as Johnny has to tightrope in a thunderstorm and have a knife fight on phone lines, all the while being the cute little twink that he is.  So for all  the folks out there who feel this is a derogatory portrayal, I just don't see it.  I just see a handsome hero who doesn't have to be masculine.",1398729600,,1533,4.251724137931035
8602986,5,B00E9HSZFW,"The Monster is an unusual film. It is heralded as a Lon Chaney film, but he only appears in a few scenes. Mostly he is a menacing presence, which is what makes this film so eerie.

Men in Johnny Arthur's town keep disappearing. As an amateur sleuth looking to prove himself to the local police and to impress his girl, he takes it upon himself to find the latest missing person. His theory is that they are connected to the abandoned asylum near an old dirt road, but the townspeople only laugh at him. One night he begins to investigate and he's taken to the asylum. Soon the girl of his dreams and her date follow. It is up to him to solve the mystery and save their lives, although the inmates have rigged the entire building to allow for sneaky exits and dangerous traps.

Fans of Our Gang will recognize Arthur as Darla's father whose birthday is ruined by the kids' good intentions. His comic chops can be witnessed here, which seems incongruant with the horror storyline, but his moments of comedy add moments of relief which is refreshing. The asylum is a seriously creepy manor and the henchmen that do Chaney's bidding are various levels of terrifying. The conclusion of the film is neat and satisfying. I highly recommend this underrated gem.",1365292800,2,1253,4.589285714285714
8602987,3,B00E9HSZFW,"The Monster (1925) is part of  the extensive Warner Archive Collection 2011 releases.  This film, directed by Roland V. West and starring Lon Chaney, goes a considerable length to prove the adage that ""there is nothing new under the sun.""  Essentially, The Monster is the precursor for the tongue-in-cheek old-dark-house-with-malevolent-horror-star-as-host movie.  Considerably later,Vincent Price and William Castle visited The Monster`s familiar territory in the House on Haunted Hill (1959), a film that has become the stereotypical example of the genre.

Director Roland V. West revisited The Monster territory again in the following year's hit, The Bat and, yet again with sound in The Bat Whispers (1930) (for which he is most remembered--well, he may actually be best remembered for giving  a deathbed confession that he murdered his girlfriend Thelma Todd). The Monster is the least known of West's dark house trilogy and, although it is the weakest of the three, it retains interest for several reasons.

The Monster is an oddity in the way it uses star Chaney.  Chaney's body of work goes a considerable distance in debunking his reputation as a ""horror"" actor.  The few horror films Chaney appeared in are more aptly described as bizarre, densely psychological melodramas.  The Monster, however, could serve as a prototype for a genre celebrity in a B-movie parody.  Chaney's Dr. Ziska is strictly cartoon horror.  He could romp with Baron Boris in Mad Monster Party (1967), or brew up a Gossamer with Bugs in Hare-Raising Hare (1946).

Hick amateur Johnny (Johnny Arthur) has just gotten his detective license in the mail, just in time to try and solve a local whodunit disappearance.  Johnny, the local nerd, has his eye on Betty (Gertrude Olmstead) but she's on the arm of the local jock hero.  If only Johnny could solve the case and win the girl.  This setup leads the three teens to the local spooky house run by Dr. Ziska, a mad surgeon running a former sanitarium.  Ziska is aided by caped ghoul who rolls imagined smokes and, with the aid of a mirror, plays saboteur to cars on lonely back roads.  Ziska is also assisted by the hulking mute, Rigo.

Trap doors, laundry shoots, secret basements and an electric chair are the props in West's dream-world.  Chaney's Ziska is surprisingly foppish with smoking jacket, a flapper-like quellazaire, and a wayward eyebrow.  Ziska wears a menacing grin at all times, making him a possible first member of a Grand Guignol Three Stooges which might include Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi in their lean salad days.  Foppish or not, Ziska is man enough to get aroused when he straps poor Betty to the table.  With Rigo's Frankenstein monster-like presence, about the only thing missing is a Vampirella to play opposite Ziska's Dr. Deadly.

The Monster is not great cinema, its not the best West, best Chaney, or best Old Dark House movie (James Whale would deliver that seven years later), but it is silent pulp and, in the right mindset, it can take you back to the days of milk duds and acne.",1322265600,5,3050,4.946954813359529
8602988,4,B00E9HSZFW,"I only gave this a three star rateing  because it's not in color and it's a silent, just like any other flick that was made before 1927. Other then this, it is comical.",1302048000,,168,4.090909090909091
