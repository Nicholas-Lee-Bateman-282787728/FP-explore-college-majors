4257348,5,B0043SS2EQ,"This series is absolutely breathtaking.  We have the Planet Earth complilation as well, and love both collections.  Rating this beautiful glimpse of nature a ""2"" is just ridiculous. Perhaps if that reviewer watched the ""Behind the Scenes"" portion of the series and realized all the work that the dedicated, talented staff put into making this gem they might change their mind.  We HIGHLY recommend this series and will be purchasing several as Christmas gifts.  Enjoy!",1290297600,7,468,5.2
4257349,5,B0043SS2EQ,"Glorious!  Absolutely stunning photography.  National Geographic does it again.  This is a very moving series that brings home the preciousness of life on this planet through the very real day-to-day struggles of many different species -- mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, etc. -- in many different climates and wildlife habitats.  One cannot view this series without gaining increased respect for the other creatures with whom homo sapiens shares the planet.  I'm buying it for everyone on my Christmas shopping list.",1290124800,9,519,5.518987341772152
4257350,5,B0043SS2EQ,"This documentary mini-series is far from an arrangement of footage seen in popular series Planet Earth and Life.  As an owner of not only those two series, but also several other BBC Earth productions I was hesitant to give this a shot.  It not only didn't disappoint but instead left me thrilled with the beauty of the footage.  The presentation is maybe slightly overdramatized in comparison with that seen in some of the BBC documentaries, however the photography is as breathtaking as anything shown in those series.  Alec Baldwin is an adequate narrator.

Bottom line, this is a must-own for any nature lover.",1290038400,15,614,4.922330097087379
4257351,5,B0043SS2EQ,"I have been a fan of Nat Geo's nature documentaries since the days when Richard Kiley narrated them on PBS, and I have many nature docs on Blu Ray, but even though I have only watched the first episode of this excellent series I would rank it in the top 5 of my collection.  Picture quality is excellent as is AQ.  Some of this animal behavior has been seen before, but it is presented in a very compelling way with excellent narrative spoken by Alec Baldwin, who also does the ""Planet Carnivore"" narration for Nat Geo Wild channel.  I rate my experience watching nature blu rays by the ""Wow"" factor, that is, how many times did I say ""wow"" while watching and in the first episode it was at least 5 times, which is good.  I am very much looking forward to viewing the remaining episodes and the behind the scenes pieces as well.  I would highly recommend this blu ray to anyone who loves nature documentaries, it is really excellent.",1289952000,31,933,4.432748538011696
4257352,5,B0043SS2EQ,"My opinion is that this series was fantastic, but I get that we're all entitled to our own.

But the point of this comment is to show you that the 2-star one is kind of bogus. Here's why I feel that way:

1) If you cannot take the time to spell out ""you"" but can add three exclamation points to the end of your sentence (while not inserting a space when the new sentence starts), then I'm already discounting your opinion.

2) If you say ""Not like Planet Earth"" in the title, then describe it as ""just copy and Paste from Planet Earth"" you're kind of contradicting yourself, aren't you? Pick one.

3) Most importantly, in your follow up comment you say that ""PQ is not that great either not to mention the sound."" Umm... the Blu-Ray disc you're making these statements about was released TODAY, November 16th. How can you possibly claim to make comments about the picture quality or sound of an item that came out TODAY, when your first and second comments about it were posted on Nov. 7th and Nov. 9th, respectively?",1289865600,29,1017,4.451612903225806
4257353,5,B0043SS2EQ,"Reviewers:  if you love this series, please add your review to bump up the lousy and rather inappropriate comment of the two-star rater.  This is NOT a BBC rehash, it's a National Geographic documentary that focuses on the perils and hazards of the migrations of a variety of wildlife, from tiny to huge.  While a Mare river crossing might be just that, each one is different and dramatic and most definitely traumatic for the faint-at-heart.  It's nature in all its glory and brutality, and it shows how humans have added to the dangers with our ever hungry encroachment on migration routes that have existed for thousands upon thousands of years.

I highly recommend this well made, excellently filmed documentary.",1289779200,74,716,4.983193277310924

When it comes to Nature shows and any documentaries National Geographic makes us feel as we are travelling with their crews to watch and experience the live shootings of the actions. Extra discs are also given as a bonus together with the Maps of the United States of America and the Whole World. Indeed it is an antique and priceless package.,1457654400,2,646,4.428571428571429

They worked too hard to produce alterations and verbiage that soared the heavens searching for survival.  Alec Baldwin was, for some reason, annoying. You get the idea.
Photography is amazing, but it looks as though Nat Geo just pulled this one out of their butts, stitching unrelated tid-bits willy-nilly..

4257368,5,B0043SS2EQ,"Superb, simply superb!  This National Geographic nature special is a four part film on animal migration.  From the Christmas Island to the Falkland Islands, Costa Rica to the Grand Tetons, National Geographic photographers searched the world to film these stunning images.  Beautiful slow-motion footage of water birds taking off from the water, wildebeest crossing the Crocodile infested Mara River and Great White Sharks feeding off the coast of Mexico.  Why do animals migrate?  There are many reasons; water, space, food, reproduction and, of all things, sunlight!  If it's too cold where you're at, move south or to a lower elevation.  If it's too dry, follow the smell of rain.  Not enough to eat?  Whale Sharks travel long distances just to be at the right place, at the right time, to feast on the eggs of breeding Groupers.  Animals have been migrating, for one reason or another, for millions of years.  The need to move is hard-wired into their genes and nothing can stand in their way.  I always thought that most migrations had to do with the seasons: north in the spring and then south in the fall.  But the reasons for moving are as varied as the animals doing the moving.  Why would Zebras face the hardship of moving from a water filled delta like the Okavango to the bone dry Salt Pans of Botswana?  On the island of Palu, Indonesia, why would Golden Jellyfish track the Sun each day, facing predatory Sea Anemones and toxic water?  The answers to these questions and others will astound you.  The location cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen, taking you to exotic places around the world.  Some of those locations are lush and green but others are barren, arid and desolate or icy and bitter cold.  The animal footage is incredible, some may be familiar, if you watch a lot of nature documentaries, but some are unique; Army Ants on the move in Costa Rica, the Little Red Flying Foxes of Australia and the most amazing migrant of all--  Monarch Butterflies on their four generation journey from Mexico to Canada and back again.  The last disk in this set gives you the science of migration and a behind the scene look at what it takes to be a National Geographic photographer and the problems they encounter while on assignment.  If you like watching nature and scenic films then this 3 disk set may be just what you're looking for.  It was for me.

Give Evil Knievil a camera instead of a motorcycle and this is what you get! The color is vibrant beyond the norm. Within this film series, the animal kingdom is not captured. A captured creature does not act as if in the wild. This film melds camera crew with wild beast to tell the story of great animal migrations. I guarantee you and your family will enjoy this.

One: the sequence for the film was setup very choppy and they tried to create ""cliff-hangers"" by cutting away from the climax of a scene and taking you to something entirely different... I understand the point, but it wasn't done very well.

4257389,5,B0043SS2EQ,"I was truly impressed at the incredible lengths the film crews went to in order to reach and capture the footage that I enjoy so much. This behind the scenes video is an eye-opening experience that generates intense respect for the photographers who regularly risk their lives to ""get the shot"". Throughout this footage there are many instances where people, individuals or even entire crews, almost die. Normally we do not see or hear about the struggles that these people face. That blindness to their sacrifices can lead to an overly critical spirit as we try to ""armchair quarterback"" their work.

This behind the scenes video was a brilliant and visceral look into the lives of the crew taking the footage, and contains many very candid moments that drive home the reality of what they are trying to do. As a Christian I know that many other Christians may not appreciate the bleeped out profanity often caught on camera, but these are real people facing dangerous situations. These people have emotions and are being pushed past the breaking point in many cases. Most of us cannot imagine the fear of not being able to find our way back home, the aggravation of getting repeatedly stuck in a war-torn land that no one knows how to navigate, or the frustration of waiting all day every day for almost a month to shoot a single hunting sequence.

These expeditions are very expensive, and the photographers risk both their lives and reputations on each excursion. What happens if they do not get the shots? How will they handle unforeseen circumstances that threaten to block their efforts? These are legitimate questions that we often overlook. These folks do not pick their shots from a catalog. They risk everything in an attempt to capture a single moment in time that is only hoped for, and cannot be guaranteed. Consider for a moment how much faith and hope that takes.

On behalf of everyone who appreciates good nature photography, I thank the crews for risking their lives and making such painful sacrifices to get this footage for us. While I strongly disagree with some of National Geographic's philosophies, I do enjoy many of the materials they produce. I am excited to see the actual Migrations video after watching this, and believe that knowing more about these people and their hardships will greatly enhance the viewing experience. We are very spoiled and blessed to have this footage captured for all time.

I would like to make some closing comments about the reviewer who had a nervous breakdown over the wildebeest baby being attacked by a crocodile. First, the baby is not being eaten in the footage. It is being dragged away. The sequence is longer in the behind-the-scenes footage than the actual Migrations film. Though sad, it is not graphic, and my four-year old daughter watched it just fine. I shelter my children carefully from PG and above materials, but allow them to see moderate nature scenes. My kids are under no delusions about how nature works, its dangers, or hardships. In my opinion nature is the best place for young children to begin experiencing and understanding the cycle of life and death that perpetually occurs in our world, regardless of whether you are a Christian or Atheist. The inability to cope with that cycle is what produces hysterical reviews such as that.

A generation is being raised to believe that it can save the planet, which is the wrong terminology. Children can be taught to maintain and restore the planet, but not to save it. That bad philosophy behind the idea that any person can ""save"" the planet is what creates nightmares for the reviewer who is unable to cope with a situation in nature that he or she is unable to change. Good photography does not intervene in nature, it captures it as it really is so that we can think through the sometimes painful ramifications of why the natural world exists in this state. Many people have devoted their entire lives to the pondering of philosophical and theological questions based on what is evidenced by nature, and that is only possible by a complete evaluation.

It is a great injustice to the photographers to ask that they not film what they see. These people arrive at the location and capture reality on film. It is up to each of us to interpret the meaning of it. I am thankful that they provided this extra footage in the Behind the Scenes video for my family to see, and hope that other viewers will not be discouraged from watching this amazing film because of one misplaced and greatly exaggerated review.",1318636800,4,4541,4.785714285714286
4257390,2,B0043SS2EQ,"The images produced by were all great. The editing and story telling were bad. Before you could enjoy one section of the story, the images are cut to another story thus making the whole video too chopped up for enjoyment. Even my 11yr old daughter was able to point out that mistake and didn't get to enjoy some of the animals and migration presented because they were stretched to long with too many sub ploys and no main story. Maybe they should re edit it with a updated version.",1307318400,2,482,4.426966292134831

4257392,3,B0043SS2EQ,"The footage and music are stunning, but the narration is painful. After listening for ten minutes I tried in vain for a setting to turn it off, but unfortunately this option is unavailable.

Alec Baldwin's voice is sufferable (albeit not the best choice) but the script is just terrible. ""The pungent aroma of hope."" What.

Rather than pepper the facts with occasional poetic notes the script is laden with unnecessary metaphor and personification. Many of these don't make much sense. It's as if someone went a little crazy with the synonyms tool on Word e.g. describing a migratory destination as an ""inferno"" would have sat better with me if the zebra were scaling a volcano, but this ""inferno"" was a dry salt lake. Hot no doubt... but still.",1303862400,7,745,4.8125

4257394,3,B0043SS2EQ,"I watch a lot HD documentaries recently, include:
- BBC: Planet Earth
- BBC: Life
- BBC: Nature's Most Amazing Events
- National Geographic: Great Migrations

I believe this is one of the best National Geographic documentaries but it not yet spectacular, it is good but can't compare with any BBC series.

The obvious point I down my star is the way it use certain CGI / computer added effect overlapping certain scenes which look stupid to me, it looks like lousy technique use. (Example: alone butterfly flying around from one place to another place)

On episode 2, they is a scene where a bear success capture a fish. This scenes is absolutely 99.9% same as a scenes appear in episode 2 of BBC Nature's Most Amazing Events as well. Is this something recycle? or make me believe they are from a same group photographer or they are shoot together but different group. How could it be exactly 99.9% same. The only different I think is National Geographic doing a much more pretty decent slow motion.

What wins over BBC series in this documentaries are the slow motion effect is perfectly well done, I love it so much.

Narration wise, at the moment I think no one can fight/win the well known narration: David Attenborough.

4257404,1,B0043SS2EQ,"Until the brutal killing of a mother's child( a baby wilderbeast) the footage of this film was amazing to see, HOWEVER; the viewer is brought face to face with a scene the man narrating the film  proclaims that this happeneing is  ""something he will never forget""  (and UNFORTUNATELY... neither will I!!!)
  A living creature, fighting for it's life.. screaming.. and screaming.... and SCREAMING for it's mother.. struggling to climb up the bank to shore while an enormous crocodile has clamped it's teeth around the calf's hind quarters. The calf's mother stands on land ( it seems only a few feet away from her child, HELPLESSLY watching her baby being brutaly and evvvveeerrrr sooooo slooooowly slaughtered by the crocodile, until FINALLY, the crocodile wins the battle I suppose.. because the mother's child is pulled underneath the water to it's horrible death...  (I'm assuming no miracle happened to save the calf. I pulled the plug out of the wall far too late and will NEVER go back to watch this again, even if the calf did somehow survive. I DO wish I had NEVER seen this film. We all kn ow that yes.. this is nature, but do we have to have the worst of it shoved in our face without WARNING???? on our Friday evening relaxing at home??? Now.. I don't know about anyon else but in ,my opinion.. this is a scene I would HIGHLY recommend NOT viewing if you  EVER want  have a good night's sleep again. Take this review seriously. THANK YOU FOR THE NIGHTMARE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC! This is ONE viewer that will NEVER come back again!",1294358400,4,1539,4.695167286245353
4257405,5,B0043SS2EQ,"While Jeremy, who rated Great Migrations with a ""2"" (out of five) is entitled to his opinion, one should not anticipate phenomenal resolution to display on a monitor (as he admitted) that does not display high definition. His other point of discontent was that this epic was too similar to the BBC's Planet Earth! The fact that these two monumental creations are similar is a great compliment to both. Having spent this past July (2010) in East Africa's Great Rift Valley, and having witnessed the greatest migration on the planet, I can attest to the fact that National Geographic has excelled in their presentation of this breathtaking spectacle! I would not hesitate to highly recommend all that both the BBC and National Geographic have produced over the past few years. Without these two dedicated resources, the world would be much more ignorant regarding science and nature.",1294185600,,881,5.041095890410959
4257406,5,B0043SS2EQ,This is a very well done documentary by National Geographic that explores migrations of different kinds of creatures. The video technology used is top notch with some breath taking scenes. Alec Baldwin's narration is also good and goes well with the documentary. This is NOT to be compared with Life or Planet Earth since they are not just about migrations. Treat this according to its own merit and you will see that this is indeed a good production.,1294099200,,451,4.794871794871795
4257407,3,B0043SS2EQ,"The picture, sound and photography are quite outstanding, but the editing ruins it for me. Unlike the BBC nature studies, where stories are presented in a logical time frame, NG have chosen to offer their stories chopped up into mini cocktail bites in an ad-hoc fashion. This is intensely irritating as one is just getting interested in an animal's struggle when the scene suddenly jumps somewhere completely different. There is no way to view the whole event, one must just wait for the next bit to pop up somewhere else later. Crocs attacking the unfotunate wildebeest for example probably turn up a dozen times throughout the programs and never do we get a full and continuous report on this.

The narration is not well written in my view and is not helped by a somewhat pompous presentation. The credits are another oddity: so speedy they cannot be read without frequently using the pause button. There is no point at all to offer data like this.

This a deeply disappointing release. So beautifully photgraphed but so stupidly put together. I strongly suggest renting or watch it on your local NG channel before buying. If you can stomach this hodge podge of wild life cocktail sticks then go for it.",1293926400,61,1205,4.788461538461538

4257411,4,B0043SS2EQ,"I have watched snippets of the episodes on the NatGeo channel on satellite service on our nice flat screen TV.  Beautiful, what I've seen so far.  Last night my daughter and I watched the music only episode.  I want to buy just that, it was wonderful.  My 7 year old thought it was great, we laughed, we tried not to cry.  The special portions of music from modern bands/artists is what I really want to get.  Does this DVD set include it?  So my 4 star rating is for that particular episode, minus one star because I cannot find a good description of what the DVD set includes.",1292284800,2,578,4.296296296296297

4257413,2,B0043SS2EQ,"As with most highly anticipated products, sometimes the high expectations they create can diminish the pleasure of the final outcome. Having followed the build-up to Great Migrations via National Geographic magazine and TV, I was expecting two things that would differentiate it from its predecessor, BBC's Planet Earth - improved video quality/techniques (as one would expect after 5 years of technology development) and a more connected theme and message. As I explain below, neither of these really materialised, leaving me slightly disappointed in the outcome.

High definition seems to be the main selling point for technology. However, in order to really appreciate this, you must have a very high quality monitor/television screen, which I do not. Having viewed this DVD series alongside Planet Earth, I can ascertain little difference between video quality on standard computer monitors and television sets. Perhaps some of the slow-motion sequences are even slower thanks to high capture rates, but the one area I can give NG a bit of credit on is their forest cinematography - BBC relied on balloons and vertical movement, but NG really does well in rigging horizontal flying foxes for the cameras to capture some unique footage like the monarch butterfly sequence.

But my main problem with Great Migrations is that its thematic message is much better described in the magazine, while the television series is inconsistent (making it similar to Planet Earth, which had no connecting theme besides the beauty of nature). I understand the intended message to be a desire to transcend the conventional boundaries of biodiversity protection (typically species and habitat conservation) to also consider the spatial needs of animal life and the hidden danger that confined spatial conservation presents. While this message is very loud in the ecological community, there hasn't really been an innovative way of presenting it to the general public. In short, the magazine presents this argument well, but the TV series is inconsistent, often demonising human development in general. In the end, I felt the message of the TV series was ""animal migrations are interesting, complex, beautiful, and under threat because of human development"". That's certainly true, but is disappointing to me, who expected a message that would go deeper than this.

Overall, for these reasons, Great Migrations ends up as too similar to Planet Earth. I prefer Planet Earth, perhaps for two rather subjective reasons - it came first, thus presented a more radical departure from lower-budget wildlife docos, and the narration of David Attenborough just sounds more appropriate than the Great Migrations narration, which is surprisingly weak.",1291852800,29,2725,5.392018779342723
4257414,3,B0043SS2EQ,"I really enjoyed watching the images throughout the documentary, but from the start two things bothered me. First, the paused and dramatic narration style does not reach the standard expected for this kind of show. Second, as an ecologist, I was surprised with the approach taken by the director. True migrations involve long distance movement of animals from one place to another and the return to the starting point, as is the case of the monarch butterflies. However, several cases shown in the documentary do not match the concept of migration, and should be treated as simple dispersal.",1291766400,10,591,5.040816326530612
