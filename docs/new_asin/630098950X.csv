7808698,5,630098950X,"Easy to follow for the beginner or brush up for the seasoned dancer.
Good music gets one moving.  You will be dancing in no time.",1307145600,,129,4.16
7808699,4,630098950X,"I use this as an option for bonus with my students when we do a basic dance unit. I am not a dancer, but I try to expose my junior high students to some basic steps. If they want to take it further for bonus I allow them to use the videos to learn more dances. They LOVE it!",1222214400,,274,3.6610169491525424
7808700,5,630098950X,"I found this type to give a very quick demonstration of various ballroom dances that will do to give you the basic steps which you should practice in our own time to make them ""yours"".",1122940800,,184,4.285714285714286
7808701,3,630098950X,"Not bad, though the instructions are not that easy to follow at times, and you have to rewind the damn tape to view it again. Overall, you get your money's worth.",1037059200,5,162,4.258064516129032
7808702,2,630098950X,"This tape is good for someone who wants to get to know the most basic steps in the 5 or 6 ballroom dances. If you don't know a thing about the ballroom dance and want a sanppy demonstration of the most primitive steps, go ahead and spend the... [money]. But if you are looking for at least a couple of moves in each dance so that you don't look like a robot on the dance floor, this tape will greatly disappoint you.",1014076800,13,416,4.085365853658536
7808703,2,630098950X,I bought this tape for my husband who has no idea how to latin dance and he got more out of watching the movie Dance with me than he did the tape.  It is very very basic and is very brief on each style.  I recommend picking a dance and getting a tape related to that style and learn that way.  This is just to basic.,978134400,13,316,3.757575757575758
7808704,1,630098950X,"My partner and I bought this tape in an effort to learn to dance for our wedding.  Boy, were we disappointed!  He tries to do too many dances on a VERY short tape, and it gets confusing.  The foot patterns were somewhat useful, but there were no instructions on how to actually dance together.  Learning the line dances was easier but the instruction section is so short and then he immediately moves on to doing variations.  It's frustrating to have to rewind the tape every three minutes to practice each segment.",970531200,35,515,4.615384615384615
