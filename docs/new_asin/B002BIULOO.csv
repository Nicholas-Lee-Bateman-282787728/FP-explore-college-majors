3894516,5,B002BIULOO,"""NFL: America's Game--Pittsburgh Steelers: The Story of Six Championships"" has a singular distinction for me. It is the FIRST sports-related DVD that I have EVER bought, and nearly the first sports-related item of any kind. I'm not really a sports fan--I don't even have ESPN! However, as a native Pittsburgher, I do watch Steelers games whenever I can. So I happened to be wandering through Sam's Club one day and spotted this DVD on display at the end of an aisle (see, product placement does work). The brilliant yellow-and-black package practically leaped off the shelf at me. I picked one up and read the blurb on the back. It looked pretty interesting--a set of 6 DVDs covering each of the Steelers' Super-Bowl-winning seasons from 1974 through 2008, with game highlights, coach and player interviews, etc. So I ordered it from Amazon (the price was a little better, plus no sales tax--a no-brainer).

All I can say is ""Wow!"" This is one of the slickest, best-produced, most remarkable documentary DVD sets that I've seen in many years. Each season gets about an hour of coverage, with a 45-minute-or-so feature program plus 10 or 15 minutes of special features. The set is everything I hoped for and then some--fascinating archival game and training footage, rare photographs, relevant interviews, outstanding narration, vibrant transfers, and on, and on. The quality, production values and sheer amount of information presented are outstanding. I haven't even watched all six seasons yet, and I'm still completely enthralled. What a great buy!

If you're a Steelers fan and own a DVD player, you should buy this set. Oh, and make sure you pick up a Terrible Towel for Super Bowl XLIV...(or XLV or XLVI...).",1258675200,34,1714,5.010526315789473

3894545,5,B002BIULOO,"""NFL: America's Game--Pittsburgh Steelers: The Story of Six Championships"" is the best collection of sports DVDs I've ever seen! I've been a Steelers fan since 1971, when I moved there as a small child. I vaguely remember the first two Super Bowl wins and remember well the next two. Of course the most recent two are fresh in my mind. Each DVD presents a synopsis of the Super Bowl season mixed with commentary from old Steelers like Mean Joe Greene and Mel Blount. It was awesome to see these old heroes of mine talking about the games. The DVDs also gave me a greater appreciation for Chuck Noll, who was undoubtedly a genius. I couldn't recommend this product more for all Steelers fans, and even if you're just a regular football fan, you'll probably find these DVDs interesting. I'm so glad I bought this.",1366588800,3,811,4.638888888888889

3894554,4,B002BIULOO,"This disc set is okay,IF you can get it cheap.  I actually LIKE the overly dramatic style of the AMERICA'S GAME series.  The problem with this DVD set is, I saw these first on NFL Network in HD.  They're beautiful, with only the vintage Steeler footage in 4:3 and everything in excellent picture quality.  So, I want an affordable blu-ray set.  Could be two discs.  C'mon, people.",1338422400,,380,4.597014925373134

3894558,5,B002BIULOO,"My husband and I bought the America's Game DVD's after the Steelers won superbowl XL and we just purchased the newest one from Superbowl XLIII and we couldn't be happier. If you are a true Steeler fan and you love the team's history, you will love this DVD. The quality of the films are amazing. There's something about the music and the way that they are shot and edited...it's very dramatic and really get's you pumped up for the season! We love seeing all of the past players and their commentaries. We play it during every season and have never been disappointed.",1296518400,6,567,4.568627450980392
3894559,1,B002BIULOO,"If you are a long-time Steeler fan, don't waste your money on this re-hash of NFL films clips.  Here's what you get: 1) The usual few slow motion clips set to dramatic-sounding orchestral music, 2) Old interviews that have been around for decades and have been sold on other videos.  The total package is great for: 1)People who have never seen the many other productions containing this stuff, 2) Hero-worshipping little children. I wish the NFL would realize that there are many longtime football fans who just want to watch the old games (before VCR taping of games was common) in full, rather than this sort of BS. The game really can stand on it's own!  The DVD collections ""Steelers Road to XL"" and ""Steelers Road to XLIII"" are both great--nothing but the uncut, uninterrupted playoff games from the 2005 and 2008 seasons. However in the age of DVRs, many fans have these games taped already.  The same does not hold true for the great games of the 1970s.",1293408000,28,961,4.668639053254438

3894561,3,B002BIULOO,"In an age where NO ONE can buy an old school 4:3 TV anymore and HDTV has been the norm for almost ten years, I find it ridiculous that the NFL can't put out a widescreen DVD set.  Or, even a Blu Ray disk set at 1080P.  All of these shows were recorded in and shown on the NFL Network in High Definition....why just full screen DVD's?

The content, formatting aside, is incredible and I think these are some of the best Super Bowl documentaries created.  Steelers hold the most!",1290556800,5,477,4.266666666666667

3894563,5,B002BIULOO,"Yes - these have all been shown on NFL Network, but it's nice to have the whole collection without taking up a ton of room on my DVR. I was disppointed to see that the DVD's were not widescreen, but they look just as good on a big screen HDTV as they did on NFL Network. Each episode also includes around 10 minutes of bonus footage.
