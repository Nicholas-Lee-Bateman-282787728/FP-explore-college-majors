After watching this episode (Secret weapons of the Third Reich) on TV, I was amazed by what I have seen, I started to look for this DVD and bought it without any hesitation. Believe it or not, the German was the first to have cruise missle, first generation ICBM, first to lauch missle thru submarine, fighter jet and many more. If the German could start WWII after all these weapons were ready, Germany would be the only super power in this world. Don't miss this DVD, it's worth [the price] and more.",1017360000,10,567,4.40952380952381
