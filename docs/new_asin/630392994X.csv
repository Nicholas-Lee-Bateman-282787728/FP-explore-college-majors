732224,5,630392994X,"This is a rare find for die-hard Thomas Jane fans that has not been released on DVD. One of his early films in which he plays a gay pool hall ""hustler"" complete with leather pants and attitude. A must see.
TLA Video has this to say about the film:
""Made for under $100,000 by Bravo as his thesis film for UCLA, this somber and searing drama, set in queer twentysomething L.A., revolves around the lives, loves and sexual relations of a group of friends and acquaintances. Serious with occasional flashes of humor, the film delves into the loneliness, self-deception and self-loathing of its several gay male characters with an unflinching realism. Described as ""Pinter-on-Fire Island"" and ""a queer Big Chill,"" this thought-provoking tale, filmed in shadowy black & white and which captures the tensions of today's post-AIDS male youth, is alternately compassionate and gritty but always perceptive.""",1195862400,11,899,5.122448979591836
732514,3,630392994X,Meh....,1418947200,,7,7.0
732515,1,630392994X,I was really hoping this was a forgotten treasure. What I found was a forgettable piece. Being in black and white it should have been artistic but the lighting made it muddy and hard to distinguish one character from another and therefore difficult to follow.,1418860800,,259,4.777777777777778
732516,3,630392994X,"A bit interesting as an artifact to a successful and somewhat odd career. But the pacing is slow and the quality of the video is not great. It's what one might expect from a very low budget independent, but it has loftier ideas not always executed fully but I admire it for that.",1417651200,2,279,4.283018867924528

732521,1,630392994X,This is one of the poorest films I have ever experienced.  Everything from the actors to the grainy black and white camera is a complete waste of time.  The story line is absolutely confusing.  The viewer seems to be expected to follow it almost by osmosis. I have empathy for actors who are given such a script to follow.  Don't waste your time or money on this dismal hour-long production.,1408147200,2,391,4.542857142857143

732633,1,630392994X,"This film is fraud, the characters are not representative of anything, and thank God for that. If you want to watch a bunch of dull and boring chain smokers and alcoholics, who will be completely sexually impotent as a result by age 30, then go for it. These guys are ugly too and the B&W seems to accentuate their ugliness. There is no plot, there is no dialogue, and there is no acting to be seen here, the film is just another gay genre ripoff.",1404950400,,447,4.270588235294118
732634,1,630392994X,Did not care for the movie...no plot to follow...barely a 1 star movie...don't waste your money or time...there are better movies to watch...,1402531200,,141,5.173913043478261
732635,5,630392994X,"I loved this movie back when it came out in 93 -- it seemed so different then with its dark depiction of LA and Palm Springs and the f%$#ed-up (and very realistic) relationships of a bunch of LA gays. A lot of people complained about the dark cinematography, but I thought it was very beautiful and an interesting contrast to the superbright technicolor of Southern California we always see. Definitely a slow movie -- and I usually hate slow movies -- but I really felt for the main character and really all of the characters. Not a lot happens, not a lot is resolved. It's definitely more of an art film than a gay film, but watching it again I have to say I liked it just as much as I did 20 years ago.",1402012800,8,705,4.229629629629629
732636,3,630392994X,Watched because a fan of Thomas Jane. He was only in it about 10 minutes. The quality of the picture was very dark. Probably representational of a time when things were quite different than they are now. Attractive cast when you could see them?,1401235200,,244,4.568181818181818
732637,3,630392994X,"What this film gives us is a sad tale of a group of pathetic young gay men for whom sex is the only distraction from their meaningless lives.  Shot in black and white in very dark places, I was squinting through most of the film to make out the images, and also straining to understand dialogue.  The young men all looked vaguely alike, so it was difficult to remember who was who.  Even the sex was not sexy.  Thomas Jane has a somewhat interesting but fairly minor role near the beginning of the story.",1401148800,5,504,4.329787234042553
732638,1,630392994X,"After watching ""Plan B"" and ""Hawaii"" this is a real letdown. Couldn't get involved enough to care for the characters or what happened to them. Most scenes are so dark it's difficult to tell who's who. Plot flops all over the place. Thomas Jane is a favorite actor, but he's unrecognizable in any way here. I'm glad he went on to better things.",1399161600,,343,4.4603174603174605
732639,5,630392994X,Thoughtful and moving.  It's also nice to revisit the early 90's (now so long ago).  Excellent performances by a strong group of actors.,1397433600,7,136,4.869565217391305
732640,1,630392994X,this was about the worst movie/doc that i have ever watched. didn't even finish it and i never not finish a movie if i pay for it. nothing to it at all.,1397347200,6,152,3.78125
732641,1,630392994X,"I'm sorry but this film was boring and dragged out. None of the characters were likeable and I don't know what they were thinking with Thomas Jane's weird hairdo. I like Mr. Jane and have seen every film he has ever been in, but in every scene he was in all I could do was look at his hair and not pay any attention to what he was saying. If you like seeing some goodlooking guys shirtless and do not care about the plot or dialog, then this film is for you.",1397088000,5,458,3.989130434782609
732642,2,630392994X,"Don't waste your time. Hard to watch, with characters you don't care about and not much story. Money wasted for sure.",1396483200,,117,4.619047619047619
732809,4,630392994X,"I found the portrayal a bit confusing. The hunk wasn't that hunky to me and the portrayal of gay guys as those looking for one night stands or sugar Dadies with f*** buddies on the side is questionable. Except for the message, the acting was creditable and the characters likeable.",1394755200,2,281,4.64

732811,1,630392994X,"This is an old b/w picture. I watched a few minutes, however, the picture quality was so poor that I just gave up on it. I mean it was so dark and fuzzy that the action was undistinguishable.",1393804800,,191,4.052631578947368

732814,1,630392994X,"Some flicks are just so pointless and depressing, disconnected, they make you want to shoot yourself out of frustration. This poorly-lit, low-production-values, pseudo-1940's B&W ""gay Noir"" film fit *that bill* perfectly. So obtuse, terse, meandering script and plot-less time-wasting one-line, angry/ambivalent dialogue made me want to stop at about 2 minutes into it. It was like a gay-teen's F-grade, low-budget, out of focus, poorly-lit rant. A rant made while on ""downers"". That should've been the title. says it all. Almost *ANY* of the totally-free Amazon-Prime GLBTQ films are better than this $1.99 24-hour rental. Trust a stranger!",1393113600,3,641,5.618556701030927

732816,1,630392994X,"What made this difficult to watch was not only the camera zooming into closeups with no lighting and the sometimes out-of-sync sound but the bland and boring over-the-top dysfunctional characters who all basically looked and acted the same. Seriously, it is really difficult to distinguish one character from the next. Yep, that was the '80's alright! Smoke-filled bars full of men who all look the same and who are all looking for the same thing; someone to spend the night with and they are not very picky. It makes me wonder what the director was thinking about trying to portray lives that were little changed from 1980 in 1993, the date of the release. At least 21 years later, many of us have stopped looking for ourselves outside of ourselves and the smart ones no longer look to drugs and booze for the answer. I found no value in this whatsoever. It was a waste of $2.11.",1392768000,2,880,4.611464968152866
732817,4,630392994X,"This independent Black and White film, has a lot going for it, about some gay

732818,5,630392994X,"Saw this film (the director's cut) about 10 years ago in a theater and was impressed with the performances and story. It is a story about bittersweet redemption and the journey one takes to resolve their past while dealing with their present.

Gay or straight, man or woman, you are drawn to these flawed characters as their needs for love are like everyone else. The story and characters have a haunting ring of truth about the patterns we repeat over and over in our own relationships.

Highly recommend for anyone who wants to see great performances and a realistic story.",1294099200,17,575,4.74

7855802,3,630392994X,"I do not like black and white films, films that hinder a clear view of the characters through many scenes filmed in almost total darkness, and films that are very sparing with information; however, this is a good film because it portrays the tormented world of people that find themselves coldly used by others. While we do not learn a lot about the main character Ethan, we realize that he is a survivor. His dark childhood has hindered his ability to achieve intimacy with others and be happy. He may spend the rest of his life as a loner as a result of it. Our sharing a few days with him gives us strength and encouragement to be survivors as well. It is also great to see the early work of a great star like Thomas Jane. I believe that Ingmar Bergman would have liked this film if he had seen it: it has recurring themes and symbols like Ethan taking showers and pictures and walking on bridges over busy highways.",1420416000,2,919,4.380116959064328
