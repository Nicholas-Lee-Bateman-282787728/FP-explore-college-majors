8558152,5,B00AW27N10,I am a huge fan of FMoF and of course of Uncle Forry. I love the interviews with him and all of the history.,1475625600,,108,3.5416666666666665
8558153,4,B00AW27N10,"Fun and fascinating.  It's an amateurish production, but that kind of fits the subject matter.  I appreciated that the filmmaker included details about the seamy side of people like Ackerman and Asimov, but be warned that it does get lurid for a bit.",1473033600,,250,4.790697674418604
8558154,5,B00AW27N10,"I grew up reading ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"" magazine and then going to the movies to see the films mentioned,  so for me, watching this video brought back some really great memories of those experiences that I cherish to this very day. Mr. Ackerman or ""Uncle Forry"" as he was sometimes called (along with his other monikers ""4sJ"" and ""4e"") was someone that I always wanted to meet and never really had the chance or opportunity to be able to do so. The video is very informative concerning Forry's life and is something that I highly recommend to anyone interested in wanting to know more about the man who contributed to the ""monster craze"" which began around 1957 (ending in the early '70's) when Universal released their classic monster films to television for the first time in what was called their ""Shock Theater"" package....",1458604800,,835,4.798611111111111

8558156,5,B00AW27N10,"I picked up Jason V Brock's new documentary ""The AckerMonster Chronicles"" while I was at the World Horror Convention in New Orleans, Louisiana, 2013.

It's just a terrific film, I highly recommend it; featuring some great interviews with William F. Nolan, John Landis, Forry Ackerman himself, and the late, great Richard Matheson. The film provides a very in-depth study of one of the most important periods in American literature, film, and genre culture. Brock doesn't shy away from digging deeper into his subject matter, either, and his bravery produces some unique perspectives about life, fandom, and sexuality from the people he is interviewing. Also, his persistence to remain original in the stylistic and artful presentation makes sticking with the film a breeze, as the visuals and sounds (superb editing as well!) make it easy on the eyes and ears.

There's no time like the present to pick this DVD up and get yourself educated on some of the most interesting and influential figures in the history of genre fiction.",1373328000,2,1029,5.0828402366863905
8558157,5,B00AW27N10,"This is a topnotch labor of love, for a brilliantly quirky, beloved, and inspirational figure in the world of fantastic storytelling, whether in book form or realized as film, Forrest J. Ackerman.

For those of us who found him through Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine--later shortened to Famous Monsters--in the late fifties, early sixties, he helped deepen and direct our already fertile imaginations. Many are interviewed or mentioned in this documentary. His inspirational power goes deep into the late twentieth century and beyond, and that reach is quite apparent both in term of cinema and fiction. Ray Bradbury and Stephen King are the most prominent examples of the latter, though many writers of my acquaintance hold a cherished spot in their hearts for this generous man.

In my early teens, I bought at the drug store and sneaked home under my jacket not Playboy but Famous Monsters, forbidden by Mom and the only time I defied her. That magazine helped seed my nascent creative urges and feeds into the fiction I have produced since.

A must-see for anyone interested in these matters!",1361491200,6,1102,5.043956043956044
8558158,5,B00AW27N10,"Some time back Jason and Sunni Brock wrote and produced a wonderful documentary about the writer Charles Beaumont. It was a freshman work that remains one of my favorite documentaries.

So I have been eager to see their follow-up work, THE ACKERMONSTER CHRONICLES, a film about Forrest J Ackerman.

To just about everyone in science-fiction fandom and the related fields, Forrest J Ackerman is one of the most famous personalities the genre produced. He was a classic huckster with a powerful ego who was as instrumental in the promotion of genre literature as Stan Lee has been to the comic book industry.

""Uncle Forry"" as he was commonly known was a true character. He was often generous, always friendly, and a natural born promoter.

This documentary--as the name implies--chronicles Forry's life. Unlike the Beaumont film, this one contains interviews with Mr. Ackerman, the project having been initiated a couple of years before his death. So we have Ackerman himself dictating a part of the proceedings.

Added to this we are treated to conversations with many of the people with whom he lived, worked, and influenced. And Forry was one hell of an influence to several generations of artists who went on to create much in the world of fantasy, horror, science-fiction, and films. Brock was good enough to give us interviews with many of these people--some well known to most of us, and some more obscure.

If you were a long-time fan of Mr. Ackerman, this documentary will  be a pleasure. If you're unfamiliar with his life and works, then you should see the film. As David Schow once said, ""All of us are Forrest Ackerman's mutant children.""

It couldn't be better said.",1359417600,10,1679,4.908127208480566
