331286,5,6301408977,"If you grew up in the 80's, or just really like the horror genre, then you CANNOT have a complete collection without this movie! Many people don't appreciate dated or lower budget horror, but in my opinion you cannot be a true horror fan without at least a respect for the B movie. The original NOTD has been a tradition on Halloween for me since I was renting it from the video store as a teenybopper. My taped copy wore out, and I was deprived for years of my Halloween tradition, so I was overjoyed when it finally came out on DVD! It features Linnea Quigley doing one of her awesomely awful acting jobs, showing off her absolutely perfect body with supreme bonhomie (her butt makes it into the movie way before her face does!) and the lead blonde is a deliciously horrible actresses who never made it past high school drama quality. Of course, the male actors are a standard array of 80's stereotypes....the blonde, preppy jock who's only after One Thing from the heroine....the smaller, wisecracking buddy....the fat jerk...and the bad boy, complete with a Brooklyn accent in this case, even though NONE of the other actors seem to be growing up in the city...and, last but not least, the requisite black guy(who is luckier than most by a long shot!)...Well, the acting may be cheesy, and the dance scene with Angela overchoreographed, the demon face may still something like a Cthulhu prawn on steroids, but this is still a classic 80's horror flick.... and watching that nasty old man get HIS still makes me chortle with glee.",1452211200,3,1533,4.681481481481481

331293,5,6301408977,"This has got to be by far 1 of my favorite horror films of all time,the entire series of films from. 1-3 & the remake as well.
But this film is where it all started,Angela and a girlfriend are throwing a party at an old rundown mortuary & all of her friends are invited. The movie starts with an old man prepared to get even with the kids on Halloween by putting razors in apples. Angela has her friend(played by Linnea Quigley) to distract these 2 nerdy store owners while Angela robs the place with enough party goods for all her guests..but they never get a chance to eat any of it. The party takes place at Hull House and a bunch of random goons and hooligans as well as a few squares show up and wake up an evil presence that lives in the furnace,the 7 souls of demons searching for new bodies to inhabit. The bodies seem to start piling up and the demons start to take over,as the party goes sour they start to realize Angela is posessed and soon transfers the evil to her girlfriend. That is when the crazy starts to unfold and the evil goes from 1 body to the next,the 1 kid there tries to hide in the car until he is forced back into the house. As the burning,biting and bleeding of all the guests starts to happen
 the 1 girl(the promqueen)& the scared kid hiding in the car
escape by the daylight appearing and they only need 1 body left
to take over and rule the earth. They finally escape and they get themselves over the fenced in brick wall. They run into the old man from the beginning and he gets upset about the crazy kids and their ""parties"" so he groans to his wife and she gives him the fresh baked apple pie...the leftover apples from halloween night. The old man ingests a razor and the wife goes ""Happy Halloween dear"" This is by far 1 of the best original stories in the horror world,filled with intense fast-paced action,gore galore and lots of very scary scenes filled with blood. The scenes of violence are killer and they are really advanced for their time,this is a film i highly recommend to newcomers to the series. Maybe you saw the 2009 version but never saw the oldschool ones,this is where it all begins. This is a set of films you should not pass up,you will NOT be disappointed.",1427414400,,2216,4.314148681055156

331304,5,6301408977,"This is a pure 80's horror movie.

Are the special effects awesome? Not really.
Is the acting superb? No.
Is the plot complex? No.

So a bunch of high school kids (played by actors in their 20's or 30's) have a Halloween party at an old funeral home way out in the sticks. You know this won't end well.
As you might expect, demons possess the house and much chaos ensues. There's plenty of gore and death - and of course female nudity.

This movie is enjoyable in only that way that 80's campy horror can be enjoyable. It doesn't take itself too seriously and you really shouldn't either. Often overshadowed by the slasher movies of the 80's, this one is a classic. If you're looking for one of those quintessential 80's horror movies, this is it.

This is rated R for a reason - brief full frontal female nudity, additional topless nudity, language, gore, and plenty of scary situations.",1413849600,,888,4.53125

331459,5,6301408977,"Outside of the low budget horror from the 90's, there's really nothing more enjoyable then what the 80's had to offer up. The art of being able to sit back and crack up at a fine B is one of Sid's favorite past times, and certainly a quality not everyone is capable of. For the pretentious movie watcher a film like Night of the Demons will be pure garbage. But for those who appreciate the beauty behind a low budget poorly written movie, then something like this will satisfy your inner beast. Within the first few minutes of the film rolling you know exactly what you're in store for. Pure un-adulterated laughs thanks to horrific acting and a budget of no more then $500. Loaded with laughs and some legitimate creepy moments, this one had exactly what we were looking for in a nice Halloween time B. It's most notable quality was the fact their were no lulls at any point. Totally watchable all the way through.

From the opening credits we are introduced to a high school crew of party goers getting keyed up for a night of 80's fun. The crew consists of 2 loose chicks, a young punk ginzo, the token black guy, the prude goody girl, a couple non discript characters, and a big fat party animal wearing a pig snout maske and lighting bolts buzzed in his hair. He was obviously our favorite. It's Halloween night and the crew has planned a party at some old creepy house which just happens to have a demon force living in the basement. Once they arrive the horrible 80's music starts pumping and everyone takes the floor like Tony Manero. All of a sudden their boom box, he it was made in 1988, stops working and the fun slows down. Now the only choice seems to be starting up a sceance. Obviously not a smart choice. Now the demon spirit breaks free from the basement and posses the two easy chicks. From here on out it spreads like wildfire through the house. In the end there are a couple survivors who stumble home bewildered as if they just watch the elf scene for the first time.

We honestly couldn't find one thing wrong with Night of the Demons. Well the entire movie was horrible, but in that perfect blend of so bad it's good. And trust us this one was more then good. It's essentially a perfect late 80's low budget horror movie. The acting is so horrible that sometimes it almost seems that there wasn't a script and they were just going with the flow. With that also add in the charm of the 80's and some creepy demon transformations and you have yourself a load of laughs. Oh and about an hour in you all of a sudden get some nice rack action going on, which was a staple of any young Sid viewing. So it met that criteria with flying colors and also hit us with an unsuspecting DMF of 3. Yeah haven't heard that one in a while. This one is perfect for your Halloween time movie viewings and a new favorite for Rogtober.",1319328000,,2839,4.354716981132076

This is a horror movie with lots of drinking, sex, and drugs, and many many moments of ohh my god did she just?! Did they just do?! Honestly as a shock value horror flick very few movies surpass this one. I'm probally a bit nostalgic for it, but only slightly I think alot of the shock moments in this movie will get more people than most of the ones in Saw or Hostel, Which are movies I do enjoy, I have the Elite Hunting Club dog tattoo'ed to my left peck.

331489,4,6301408977,"I would say that one should watch this movie for the awesome animated title sequence, even if they have no intention of watching the rest of the film.  That was what I was planning on doing when I found this old polished turd on Hulu a good sixteen years after I saw it on cable TV.  But it just sucked me in, and I remembered why I liked it so much to record it on VHS, and why I tape-recorded the music of the opening sequence.

First off, if you are a serious horror fan that likes really frightening movies then maybe this is not for you.  This movie is cheesy... really cheesy... I mean REALLY REALLY CHEESY.  And the funny thing is, it's not the special effects.  The special effects are great, and well done.  You see the work of excellent makeup artists, who really know their craft, great crafted props, and a rather disturbing scene with a lipstick tube.  The cheese comes around with the somewhat mediocre acting, canned sound effects, terrible synthesizer sounds for added shock value, and awful one-liners.  You begin to see rather ridiculous stereotypical personalities from the moments the opening credits stop rolling.  Stooge is a fat and pig-headed rock n' roll bully, who is adequately represented with his cheap-ass pig nose costume.  And Stooge's first victim of his personality and a drive-by mooning, not counting the others in the car with him, is another ridiculous stereotype... The unnamed old man, who is convinced that all teenage kids are rotten and going to hell.  There's a lot more I could say about the others in the medium-sized group, but let's just say that almost all the major characters in this movie have some sort of vice and you will end up waiting to see ""who gets it next"".

The premise is simple: A simple Halloween party being thrown by the typical goth girl, who everyone thinks is weird and that ""Halloween is like Christmas for her.""  The party is at an old abandoned mansion that used to be a funeral home, until one of the owners killed their entire family inside and then committed suicide.  Don't worry, the whole backstory is introduced by one of the partygoers, as though he was reading verbatim from a script.  One by one, the guests are killed, possessed, or mutilated then killed.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  The movie does start to fall apart once most of the cast are killed off, with lots of running around and girly screams, but you got this far.  Why not go all the way.

331492,5,6301408977,"Caught your attention, didn't I?  LOL.  This is pretty much my FAVORITE Halloween Horror movie to throw in the DVD player as I turn the lights off, light the candles, and plop myself down on the couch with a jumbo bag of reese's peanut butter cups and vanilla frappucinos to gorge out on all night.  AAaaaahhhhh... the sweet, sweet moments and the divine pleasures of The Halloween season--which I, myself take VERY seriously, I might add, being a MAJOR horror movie fanatic and a child at heart and all.  It's simply my favorite holiday!!  You guys can take Christmas anyday.  Okay, I'll STFU now.

Of course, this movie is a super cheesy 80s horror flick, but there is actually somewhat of a plot in this movie, believe it or not.  Miss Angela, the hostess, decides to throw a harmless bash at Hull House, the infamous haunted mansion located on the outskirts of town.  The house also happens to be an abandoned funeral home.  The town residents know all too well about it.  Basically... the smart thing to do would be to just to stay away.  But this being a horror movie and all--we wouldn't have a horror movie if that happened, would we?  Anyway, it's all fun and games during the party until a demonic entity starts to possess the guests one by one, leaving the 'leftovers' to fend and fight for their lives, as they risk it all to get the HELL outta' there!  Easy as pie, right?  Wrong.  What they soon find out is this haunted house is very much alive, and has a secret plan of its own.  This house wants to keep them there.  FOREVER.

Not only is ""The Lipstick scene"" one of the most bizarre scenes I have EVER witnessed in a horror movie--(Yikes)--But I'm going to have to say that my favorite part of this movie has got to be ""Angela's demonic dance"" she performs for well over a good 2-5 minutes or so towards the beginning of the movie.  It hallucinates you with the flashing strobe lights freeze-framing her every twisted move.  As she mindlessly loses herself to the hardcore-demonic music... This entire effect and scene is just amazing, IMO!  It definitely sets off the eeriness in the film.  And after her demonic dance, you're left there thinking... ""OOkkaaaaayyy, now WTF was that all about..???""  Then the film moves on to the lipstick scene and so on and so forth, lol.

Whenever I look at the cover of this DVD, I just wince at how damn FUGLY Angela is as the demon, LMAO.  In part 2, when she was human, she was pretty hot, though.  Sexy and ""Killer"" looks.  I like both 1 and 2 ""Night of The Demons"" movies about the same for very different reasons.  The original, of course, cannot be replaced and will carry that novelty along with it forever.  But sometimes a surprisingly good sequel or two will follow through afterwards.

331542,4,6301408977,"Its Halloween night and you're too cool to attend your school's dance so what's a stereotypical teen to do? Apparently, go to a party at a desolate funeral home that is being hosted by the creepy girl from history class and start getting wasted! It's a time tested recipe for dead teenagers that's been roasted to perfection in Night of the Demons. The party is going swell until an impromptu sance unleashes a demon from the basement's crematorium. Don't you just hate it when that happens?

The setup is just laughable. First off, Angela (Amelia Kincade), the gothic chick, throws the party and she only invites seven people! Worse yet, none of them seem to really like one another. It quickly becomes apparent that everyone is just one bad decision away from becoming demon fodder. For fun try to figure out who will survive until the end! Character development is non-existent, but surprisingly some of the teens do slightly break away from their stereotypical roles.

Angela is the star of this freak show and after her interpretive dance to Bauhaus's ""Stigmata Martyr"" the movie bursts into high gear. She turns into a demonic hag and I'll admit its creepy watching her glide across the dilapidated floors searching for fresh meat. One by one new victims become possessed and each has their own devilish persona. Watching survivors flee in terror from their former classmates is mean and just plain fun.

The minute Night of the Demons started up with its modestly animated credits I knew I was going to enjoy it. It's full of clichs, laughable (read: quotable) dialog and amateurish acting, but the entertainment factor is through the roof. There is a superfluous boob or beaver shot seemingly every few minutes and it's loaded with imaginative gore effects. We're also treated to a scene with a pair of breasts and tube of lipstick that simply must be seen! The claustrophobic atmosphere is perfect and it's coupled with a fun metal and synthesizer driven soundtrack. If you can't tell, Night of the Demon's is one wild movie that exemplifies all that is good about horror in the 80s.

Night of the Demons is a great movie to break out around Halloween. It's a self aware low budget schlock-fest that knows to keep it focus on R rated material. Director Kevin Tenney employs some of Sam Raimi's camera tricks which give this the feel of a poor man's Evil Dead. Younger horror buffs might find this atrocious, but those that lived through the 80s will undoubtedly enjoy this one.

331595,4,6301408977,"I really struggled with how to rate this film.  In cinematic terms, it really should be a 2.  Bad script, inexplicable story, high school acting, slightly better than amaturish camera work. But then you watch it and amazingly, you have a good time (at least I did).  So I add another star for the ""fun factor"".  Now, this is a DVD. So what is that worth?  A pretty fair production with good quality picture.  So, add another star.

That's how I got to 4 stars.  I can't add a fifth star.  That's just not fair to the truly good horror films out there (I'm talking ""Alien"" 5 stars).  Now you might ask; ""Alien"" is only one star better than ""Night of the Demons""?  Well, no.  Not really.  ""Alien"" is, at least, twice as good as ""NOTD"".  But don't forget the entertainment value of this film, (which is why people supposedly make these things).  So lets get to the point. Here is a list of points that cause me to really enjoy this film/DVD:

-There is a plot, a story, even a tiny back story.  It's all very clumsy and fairly pointless.  The writers don't really try to explain anything too fully.  Why fill our heads with all that mess anyway.  The goal here, apparently, is to build a scaffold upon which many cool and scary moments can be thrown together.

-Nudity is frequent enough.  In the extras, it is mentioned that the nudity had a point and was not there as exploitation.  YEEAAH, RIIIGHT.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy they exploited the actresses.  But there was very little point to it.  But that's entertainment and sells tickets/DVDs.  We all know that's why it's in this film, and WE LIKE IT!!  It does add some very crazy moments to the film too.

-The acting was just bad enough that you chuckle inside.  Nobody is taking this too seriously and it pays off.  Unbelievably, I actually started liking some of these poorly pieced-together characters, and you know very early who's going to get it.

-Camera work and edditing were pretty OK.  Very cliche angles and trick.  This really worked well for me.  It takes about 10 seconds into the film to realise:  ""I'm watching a teenage, nudy, monster, horror film from the 80s"".  Knowing this, anybody who lived through that era totally is on board with this style of film. Some pretty effective scenes too.  The dance scene is pretty creepy for instance.  You actually question whether or not you're seeing things right.

-The sets/funeral home were surprisingly pretty good.  This is a great spook-house and it works very well for this film.  I think the settings inspired alot of the films story/scenes(just seems that way to me).  All the set-pieces were pretty memorable and effective. I've seen this film twice and I remember most of the rooms in the funeral home and what happened in them.  Not bad with my poor memory.

-Overall, this is honestly a scary movie.  I like the characters the bad actors are playing, I forgot about the wide open story/plot(or lack there of).  I liked the cliche camera work in a nostalgic sort of way. I thought the sets were really creepy.  I liked how the film never took itself too seriously with many goofy one-liners.  I liked the makeup and gore affects (actually pretty good job there).  I enjoyed the pointless, yet bizarre nudity.

In the end it all comes together in the surprisingly scary, tacky, visually effective, wierdly charming cheese-fest.  Even the clumsy attempt at a ""Creep Show"" like ending was pointless fun. It seems that the film makers basically made a film with as many of their favorite horror movie bits and pieces thrown together so that they could have a film with all the stuff they liked.  It worked for me.

I don't know if I'm making any sense of this.  I can't defend this film artistically. The point is this is a pretty cheap, scary horror film with just enough plot to hold it together that I happened to enjoy quite a bit.  Go figure.",1190592000,2,3874,4.575182481751825

this is a good 80's horror film watch it.",1174780800,,184,3.717948717948718
331623,4,6301408977,"Ah, the 80s! Funny clothes and even funnier haircuts. Still, there is a certain charm about it now. Take NIGHT OF THE DEMONS for instance. It starts out slow and fairly lame, then BOOM! Linnea Quigley (Return Of The Living Dead, Graduation Day) gets possessed and it's party time! Yes, I'm a Linnea loon! She has a way of turning just about any movie into a must see classic! You've all seen or heard about the infamous ""Lipstick Disappear-o"" scene and Ms. Q's tendency to shed her clothes like nobody's business (praise the Lord). However, she is also great in her demonic persona. She is pretty creepy and menacing for a SoCal gal! Check out her face when she says, ""Stop looking at me!"" Yikes!

The special effects are great for their time and there are some genuine ""boo!"" moments that make you jump.  Definitely a fun movie to watch and an essential part of a decent horror movie collection.",1171843200,2,323,4.440677966101695
331625,4,6301408977,"Overall, this is one of those late 80s horror films with cheap actors and low-budget settings. But, the script did not need high-paying actresses like Julia Roberts or Susan Sarandon in order to be successful. The film is trictly about the average horny teenagers who are looking for a cheap scare for the Halloween night at an abandoned parlor home. It was the sight of a gruesome massacre, according to the story. Apparently, the house is POSSESSED and the spirits living inside of it are considered demons. So, here comes the spirited crowd of partiers with a willingness to raise some hell. And, of course, you can predict the storyline as of what happens. The only thing that I can say is useful out of these B-horror films, just as I commented on ""Puppet Master"" and ""Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives"", is that these movies provided some hintful ideas for women who might be having some sexual difficulties regarding getting their mates ""in the mood"" as frequently as they are. If you women are experiencing that problem or would like to spice it up, then pull out your debit card and order some horror flicks mentioned. Some of the best ideas have been pulled out from these films, not Playboy pornography. One peculiar scene is where two lovers are getting it on in a coffin. Out of all the women I have personally dated, maybe only one or two would be possibly open-minded enough to elaborate in some different settings for sexuality. Key word: POSSIBLY!

 So, take a glance at some of these horror films. You might catch an idea. But, in reality with all due respect to the fellas, I don't think the majority of us will get very lucky. As my father always said, ""Only in the movies!""",1170806400,2,1696,4.612582781456954
331626,5,6301408977,"i gotta admit, when i first saw this movie back in 1989 as a kid,i was pretty scared! now as an adult, this movie was so funny! but its still a great 80's movie for any horror fan! i just love when ""angela"" the demon says where you going roger, the party just began!",1170028800,3,266,3.9444444444444446

But now as I watch it as an adult I realize how funny it is especially the line about the moms underwear and the lipstick thing.  Oh yeah anyway the teenagers go out to party on halloween night in and old house on a hill that was once a funeral home.  Low and behold the teenagers awaken evil spirits that then begin to possess a couple of them and then the killing starts.  This movie is very cheesy with bad acting but very worth buying if you are a horror movie fan.,1169164800,,552,3.9909090909090907
331628,4,6301408977,"Night of the Demons could easily fall into the category of forgettable, cheesy, 80's horror films, but it manages to deliver on most accounts despite it's flaws.  Taking a well worn plot, a group of teenagers have a Halloween party in a supposedly haunted house and awaken the demons lurking within, Night of the Demons ends up being a pretty fun ride.  One by one the teens end up becoming possessed by the evil spirits until it's down to a handful of survivors who survive the night, and there's gorey mayhem in between to boot.  80's scream queen Linnea Quigley (Return of the Living Dead) is here in quite a memorable role, including the memorable use and hiding of her lipstick.  For a low budget horror film, Night of the Demons still manages to pack in a good amount of nicely done gore effects, which are reason enough alone to check out this hidden little gem.  Since the DVD is from Anchor Bay, you can expect a decent amount of extras to be found, including commentary by director Kevin Tenney (Witchboard), trailers, and an interview with Quigley about her work on the film and career frequently getting naked in horror films.  All in all, though it may be cheesy, Night of the Demons still manages to pack enough goods for some horror fun, and don't forget to eat your apple pie.",1168819200,9,1292,4.571428571428571

331644,5,6301408977,"Night of the Demons is a good horror flick.  Stooge and Sal are worth the price alone of the DVD.  There is one hilarious scene that takes place in a grocery store where one of the main female characters is bending over to distract the goofball store clerks while her friend steals them blind.  This scene is suppose to be sexy but I it was anything but, the girl bending over makes the walls jealous.  Good buy though.",1148860800,3,419,4.333333333333333
331645,4,6301408977,"If you are looking for a heckleable time, watch ""Night of the Demons"". Demonly annoying in the beginning but demonly entertaining as it goes on with Angela's sexy spider dance, the lipstick in the nipple disappearing act, and very witty but severly unamusing lines delivered by demons--such as, ""I was just warming my hands by the fire"", ""STOP LOOOOOKING AT MEEEEEE!!!"", and especially the guy getting locked in the coffin by Stoog, who pleads, ""Wait, Stoog, NOT NOW!"".

All in all, some scenes just make no god damn sense. But thats why we call it demonly and ummmmmm......well yes. It is after all, ""The Night of the Demons---DUUUUNNNNNNNNNNN!!!""",1148515200,3,648,5.0
331646,2,6301408977,"Yes, Mimi Kinkade is as white-smoking hot as a firecracker on an Alabama tin-roof in high summer.

Yes, Linnea Quigley is as white-smoking hot as the fender of a '57 Chevy left out in the middle of Death Valley on a 135 degree day.

And yes, if the intro animation were the whole flick, ""Night of the Demons"" would rock.

But it isn't. And that's why ""Night of the Demons"" is what Carbon Dioxide gas would be if it were a movie: odorless, colorless, tasteless, scareless, and deadly dull. How can you go wrong with a late-1980's horror flick featuring a Halloween party held in a decrepit mausoleum with a dark and fatal past, a passle of booze-snookered high-school hooligans, with a few bored and hungry demons tossed in for good measure?

Kevin Tenney proves you can go very, very wrong. Despite heaps of atmosphere, a moody setting, the coolest animated credits in horror movie history, and two red smoking hot leads (Mimi Kinkade and Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), ""Night of the Demons"" is all set-up and zero pay-off. This is a film in which you constantly hiss ""Great Crom, this *has* to get good any minute""---right up to the final credits, when you deflate and sigh ""that's all there is?"".

The only exception of the final ""Apple Pie"" Sequence, at the very end of the film, in which a misanthropic old geezer gets his just desserts, quite literally. To be brutally honest, apart from the brief eye-gouging scene, the little fun you'll have with this turgid flick---assuming you love horror movies, that is---is if you fast forward to the end of the movie, where you'll see what happens to nasty old men who hate Halloween.

Had Tenney capitalized on the film's final four minutes of Grand-Guignolesque nastiness throughout ""Night of the Demons"", this would have been an unabashed four-star romp. Alas, ""Night"" is bloodless and toothless.

If you're a horror movie completist, you'll check this thing out---I realize that.

I'm writing this review simply as a warning beacon: do not go into ""Night of the Demons"" unarmed. Do not go with high hopes. Do not expect a gore-encrusted goulash a la Dan O'Bannion's ""Return of the Living Dead"", as I, seeing Quigley's name on the credits, did. Do not think that the cool intro animations, the Borgo Pass 1980's Bauhaus tunes, the red smoking hot presence of Kinkade & Quigley, and the awesome glory of the mirror shot promise you a satisfying horror flick.

In summary: Do not crash this party with high expectations or you won't be ""partying hearty"" when the credits roll. First off, director Tenney took out a big bloody scalpel and ripped off the infinitely superior Italian gore maestro Lamberto Bava: ""Night of the Demons"" is basically Bava's disgustingly satisfying ""Demons"" & ""Demons 2"" without the fun, the scares, or the gore.

In those films, it is true you have to suffer idiotic dialogue and excruciating dubbing, but you are rewarded for your patience. By contrast, unless you like watching complete idiots wander through darkened hallways crying out for each other, you'll never get a satisfying payoff from this well-appointed, searingly dull waste of time and celluloid.

Yes, Mimi Kinkade's dance to the sepulchral ""Stigmata Martyr"" made me run out and buy the Bauhaus ""Singles:1: CD. But style aside---and at times, ""Night of the Demons"" has style in spades, leaving the viewer in the hellish limbo of always expecting that the film is about to get good---what's the point?

What's the point of a horror flick that never delivers the tricks and treats? What's the point of a movie about demonic possession when the red sauce never really flies? How is it possible for mere mortals to evade demons merely by walking down a hallway a few feet and turning right, while the supposedly rampaging demon ambles on in the other direction?

Why is it that the high school sweethearts, murdered while making out in a coffin buck-naked, dutifuly don their clothes as undead demons before slaughtering their schoolmates?

I'm a lenient horror fan and gorehound; I don't ask much. What I ask for is this: goop, gore, blood, and scares. ""Night of the Demons"" is about as scary as a haunted house held at a local church. Two stars for the delicious Quigley (with her extra-storage space for lipstick) and the luminous Kinkade (who devours the camera every second she's on), 1/2 star for the eye-gouging and razor blade finale. This is the rare instance in which you should ditch Angela's ""party"" and hit the high school stomp instead. You'll be glad you did.

Sure it isn't a classic like Halloween or Nightmare On Elm Street but, it has what a lot of them don't have...It's Fun To watch. Now I'm not saying that the previously mentioned films are bad on the contrary. What I mean to say is that alot of times a horror movie although scary can get rather boring after a few viewings. That is what makes this film so great. It is scary yet it has humor, interesting characters, T&A, Excellent soundtrack, Beautiful opening credits & is fun to watch in a group of friends during the late night hours. It never fails to entertain upon multiple viewings. It doesn't have to be ""Oscar"" material but, lets face it most of us will remember this film long after ""Oscar"" winning films like Million Dollar Baby are forgotten. My Top 5 Horror Films:

Kept waiting for something to happen to get my attention. Had the definite 80's feel of Hell Night and Return of the Living Dead etc. but lacked in almost everything that makes a standout horror flick. The demon's voices sounded as though the person doing them was going to start coughing in the middle of the sequence. A little too cartoonish for my tastes.",1120089600,,508,4.3578947368421055
331679,5,6301408977,"Story:

Goth chick Angela decides throw a party on Halloween night at the old Hull House. Hull House comes with a gruesome past. Evidently, a series a gruesome murders occurred there several years before. When the party guests arrive they unleash the demons that have been lying dormant. One by one they each fall victim to possession. Will anyone escape?

Review:

Night of the Demons has to be one of the coolest B movies from the 80s. Bad acting, gore, and nudity are all present in this flick. The make-up effects are very impressive and still hold up 20 years later. I actually believed that the party guests were demons. I don't know where they found the actors for this movie. It has to be some of the worst acting ever captured on film. Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley are the only ones with some decent acting chops. I loved how the movie borrowed elements from other films. It mainly borrowed from The Evil Dead. This is the perfect movie to put on during your own Halloween shindig. Don't expect a serious film. The film is absolutely outrageous and is not intended to be taken seriously. So pop some popcorn and have a groovy time! I'm looking forward to the remake coming out this Halloween.

Pros:

Angela's (Mimi Kinkade) sexy dance was one of the greatest moments of the film. The film is extremely low budget, but it was filled with great effects. The strobe light, the lipstick scene, and the possessions were all pretty slick. The film also managed to keep up the creepy atmosphere throughout the whole 90 minutes.

Cons:

It did take about 40 minutes for people to start getting possessed. But that really didn't bother me.",1118361600,,1643,4.644827586206897
331680,3,6301408977,"Great intro animation, cool goth-punk soundtrack, a lively collection of 80s teen stereotypes (goth chick, slut, punk, priss, preppy, etc.), and demonic possession in a decrepit mausoleum ... how could you go wrong?

Well, for one thing, ""Night of the Demons"" takes a loooooooong time to get off the ground - I'm talking 45 minutes or so before the first sign of demonic possession. In the meantime, we're forced to muddle through all the eye-rolling dialogue, bad acting and nonsensical plot that you'd expect (and I've come to love) in any low-budget 80s horror flick.

The body count is also low and fairly uncreative. One partygoer gets his eyes gouged out. Another has her neck broken. Somebody loses an arm. Another guy falls on a picket fence. Unless I'm missing something, that is it for the violence in this movie. When I saw that ""Night of the Demons"" has been compared to ""The Evil Dead,"" I expected graphic bodily dismemberment. Instead, throughout most of the movie we watch a few nameless survivors run around a creepy mausoleum while gibbering demons chase (or levitate) after them. The demon makeup is pretty solid, but I expect more blood in a horror flick.

So why did I give this three stars? Partly because of the animated intro, neato soundtrack and the cheese factor - ""Night of the Demons"" doesn't take itself seriously, and it doesn't want you too, either. But the real reason I gave this movie a decent grade is the liberal doses of skin.

One nice bra shot (excellent rack on the blonde priss). One nice panty shot (nice rear on the blonde tramp). Excellent scene featuring a smoking hot goth chick flashing her thigh-highs and garters while dancing to Bauhaus' ""Stigmata Martyr"" and a strobe light (could be the highlight of the movie). Two scenes of above-waist nekkedness; one scene of below waist frontal nudity. That - along with some corny good fun - is worth at least three stars in my book.",1108944000,2,1924,4.768768768768769
331681,1,6301408977,This movie is absolutely the worst movie ever made. Not only was the acting something out of a junior high play but the demons could not have sucked more. They float around and breathe loudly at people and well that's about it. And seriously what was with the lipstick in the boob thing?? They must have known people were getting bored and boobs were the only way to save the movie. At least the second one was funny. This one just made me want to stop living. Dear God I want those 2 hours of my life back!,1106697600,2,507,4.183673469387755

331684,5,6301408977,"Overwhelmingly entertaining, spooky, supersexy, atmospheric, bloody-good horror ride.  The basic story - a bunch of kids sneak into a funeral parlor for a Halloween party and accidentally awaken an ancient demon.  Nothing especially original here - substitute 'funeral parlor' for 'abandoned house' or 'musuem' or 'dorm' or whatever, and occasionally substitute 'sneak into' for 'are invited into', and you have an oft-used idea, sometimes well-done and sometimes not so well-done.  From the opening credits of ""Night Of The demons"", though, with its immediate establishment of atmosphere and its superb musical score, you know you're going to be in for something a cut above.  In the next few minutes, it becomes so clear that it's not going to matter if the same kind of thing has been done before, this is going to be done at a level that irrelevates questions of originality.  It's like ""True Lies"" - that movie, about an undercover operative keeping his baddie-fighting activities hidden from his family and maintaining a secret life - there's nothing especially original about that, it's just done SO much better than 95% of the action movies that previously treaded similar ground that it doesn't matter.  And like ""True Lies"", which actually incorporates alot of innovative scenes into its familiar prescence, ""Night Of The Demons"" actually innovates in its individual scenes to a fine degree, aided by superior camerawork, superior special effects, and just plain superior movie-making.

  Tremendously fun without becoming a horror-comedy and Certainly not a spoof; manages genuine tension and fearsomeness to keep things from becoming lightweight, this'll remind longtime horror fans why they fell in love with the genre and may win a few non-fans over in spite of themselves.",1098921600,6,1787,5.330960854092527

This is a pretty funny and surprisingly solid B Horror Film. The story is by the numbers, and the acting by now seems a bit dated, but when the fun starts in the house, the film takes a creepy turn.
A group of kids hang out at the abandoned Hull House on Halloween night. Hull House is a house possessed, so the demons that inhabit it are pure evil. They kids have their party until someone decides to play around and summon the demons. And one by one they begin getting posessed by a demonic forces.
It's up to Judy to out live, and out last her demonic attackers.
Amelia Kinkade plays Angela. Watch for her creepy dance sequence. It's pretty memorable and what happens right after elevates Amelia's character, Angela from B Movie character to a horror powerhouse like Freddy and Jason. But unfortunately the 2 sequels that followed are inferior and wound up botching her character. Linnea Quigley does something very interesting with a tube of lipstick. And the gore effects are pretty cool.
It's a solid film that is finally getting the DVD release it deserves. If you are a horror fan you'll be happy to own this little known film. It brings back memories of the golden days, when horror had it's own full fledged section in video stores with hundreds of titles to choose from.",1089676800,19,1300,4.583690987124464

The set-up is familiar: A group of high schoolers have a Halloween party at what turns out to be a haunted house (or in this case a possessed funeral home). One-by-one they become possessed by a demon and murder their friends. What makes this film a classic is the acting and dialogue. It's fantastic! Seven out of the ten kids at the party are the most obnoxious people you will ever see on film. The one-liners and cut-downs they throw at each other still have me laughing out loud. They're so obnoxious, in fact, that it didn't bother me watching them get killed. I'm able to just sit back and enjoy the very good make-up and special fx as each of the kids meet their gruesome end. That is until the near end of the film when only two ""good"" kids are left. I want to see them live and the film becomes somewhat intense as they have to fight their way through the demons and past the funeral home walls to safety. The music is great. The setting is great. The dialogue is great. The T&A is great. If you have even the slightest affection for horror films, you won't regret purchasing this `80's gem.",1048032000,3,1279,4.333333333333333

Yes, it has all the teen horror sterotypes to be expected (it was made in 1988 when the sub-gene had been well hammered out). There's the pig-man, there's the outside, the nerd, and the african-american guy that to my memory has no reson to be friends with them.

331776,5,6301408977,"In the land of forgettable B movies spawned in the 80's, we sometimes find castoffs that have been unkindly disregarded and, by many, forgotten. Night of the Demons is one such film, mixed into the lot because of its budget restraints and somewhat predictable approaches to horror (people in ""possessed home"" being slaughtered by spirits, demons, etc.) Still, this movie did possess one thing that most of these showing lacked. It had atmosphere that was simply eerie and a playground (Hull House) worth of a classic demonic killing field.
For anyone who doesn't know about the film (without spoiling anything), its Halloween night and some teens decide that they want to spice up their lives a bit.  So, they decide to party at Hull House, built upon the scene of brutal slayings predating colonization of the area. Soon, the teens discover that its not all fun and games when dealing with a possessed house, and have to struggle to leave with their lives.
Personally, I find this to be one of the more appealing products from this time, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a little comedy, some decent special effects that play off the horrific setting, and loads of characters ripe for the plucking.",1021593600,41,1210,4.845410628019324

Right from the start(when the music starts) you know your going to need to hold onto something tightly. For the first half hour of the movie...it's the funniest thing you will ever see!! Stooge (Hal Havins) is the not so typical foul mouthed party animal. The director had a really good feel on what would appeal to an 80's teen.(and 90's teen in the near future.) Hull House is by far the best environment for a movie like this. The music is the greatest horror movie music ever! Far surpassing that of Nightmare on Elm Street's. It throws alot into the atmosphere of the movie. The first time I saw this movie, it gave me that trapped feeling. No escape. I loved it! The special effects are amazing, done by the same man that did them for Ghostbusters and Nightmare on Elm Street. Beautifull. Dennis Micheal Tenney did an incredible job recording those awsome party songs! Kevin Tenney is a great director who had his sights set on scaring the world with Night of the Demons. Did a good job too! The movie is just too much for some people.

The sun dried poodle terd line was most definitely oscar worthy. the makeup is actually really good which caught me off guard the first time i saw it on showtime.

Angela, one of the teens, is among the first to be possessed and turned into a fanged monster. One by one, each teen is infested by the evil until only two are left to battle them all.
Okay, so the acting isn't great and plot wears thin after about 15 minutes, but the visual and make up fx are worth watching alone. Linnea Quigley's infamously shocking ""lipstick tube"" scene still packs a punch, while the other kids demon faces give Linda Blair a run for her money.
