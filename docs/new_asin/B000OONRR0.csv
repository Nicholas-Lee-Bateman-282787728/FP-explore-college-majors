8343263,1,B000OONRR0,"I was really excited about getting this DVD and had it on my Christmas list.  It was a big disappointment.  The quality ia not very good and the content appears to be outdated.  I have taken Iridology classes and I was looking for something that would show the Iris and how to look for certain conditions, kind of like a show and tell.  Instead, it was an Iridologist practioner who seemed more concerned about talking about how great that he was and how much experience that he had.  There were no pictures of eyes.  There was just the practioner looking into a patient's eyes and talking about his observations.  What a disappointment.",1262131200,8,637,4.633928571428571
