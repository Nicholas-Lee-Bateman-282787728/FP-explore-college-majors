8484037,3,B005R2S3XM,"Let's start with this: This presentation is hard-core pornography. When I purchased this I had assumed that it was soft-core fare, like most other releases labeled ""grindhouse"" that are out there these days. Au contraire. So if you don't care for hard-core, move along.

Also, if you like hard-core but don't want to see sex between ugly, hairy, fat people, you probably will want to move along too.  I had to fast-forward several times because I was basically grossed out.

However, if you're fascinated by this strange and very brief era in American cultural and cinematic history, this one is worth a look--primarily because of its extras, which include a commentary (!!! how many pornos have that?) as well as an interview with the director. Carter Stevens is a delight; seems like a really cool, funny, well-adjusted guy and sounds kind of like Danny DeVito.",1358640000,4,863,4.937931034482759
