3877086,5,B0029LD2PS,"I just saw this movie on the Speed Channel and, like other viewers, enjoyed it greatly. It is the story of a man's love affair with a car he first bought years before.

But the movie is so much more than that. It is a love affair of good friends, family, and, of course, the car and the racing. The car is not the star of this picture; the human spirit is.

Unlike other car films, the story of Eric Bana and his life covers so much more than the usual celebrity hobby nonsense. The cameo appearances of Jay Leno and Dr. Phil are well done. You see a slightly different side of Jay here. The sub-plots of his parents, his own young family, his career in the movies, and his life-long friendship with his ""mates"" makes this picture the best thing I've seen in a long time.

Maybe Michael Moore could watch this and finally learn how to make an accurate film.",1262563200,10,857,4.245398773006135
3877087,5,B0029LD2PS,"""Love the Beast"" is one of the finest car movies to come out in the past decade. Forget ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise, ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" or some of the other offerings, this movie is the real deal. I was shocked to discover this airing on the Speed channel as this is a movie I would have seeked it out. It just flew under my radar for some reason. But what you have here is a love story to a car, Eric Bana (who I had no idea was a car guy) and his Ford Falcon Coupe). But this movie touches on many levels, the friends and family that surround Bana because of his love for his car, the philosophy of machines having human like qualities, the experience of racing cars, the peaks and valley's of motor sports, and just plain joy. This movie was very important to me as I race cars and love my cars and have relationships with all of them. But really this movie is accessible to anyone, that is the beauty of it. It isn't simply a ""car"" movie or a ""race"" movie, it is a total ""journey"" movie. This movie tells a personal story that we get to experience with Bana, it is really great and human and wonderful. I equate this with two of my favorites ""Long Way Down"" and ""Long Way Round.""",1261958400,20,1194,4.150862068965517

If not, you might still get something out of it or better understand your family and friends that love their muscle cars sooo much!  Eric Bana is a very nice and decent guy.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, but as I said, the car people will LOVE THIS!! The story goes from young lad to modern day actor and his relationship with his Ford.

It is such a stable one's libido at a fast car modernised and advanced since Eric Bana The Aussie-actor-in-Hollywood had his stuff acquired at a teen age of fifteen (seventeen, according to father of him???), that movie looks&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/quite-sexy/dp/B000B9E2M2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">quite sexy</a>&nbsp;and surprisingly entertaining if even a viewer had gained only the feeling of seeing a top-class advertisement of big fast American second-hand vehicles.

3877120,5,B0029LD2PS,"This movie reminds every gearhead/petrolhead why they are the way they are. It should help those whom know those car nuts why they are so crazy. A movie made with a lot of HAH-art (proper Ozzie pronounciation?)

I am crazy that way. I have a mint (looking) Infiniti G35 Coupe that is modded to the gills for the track (Nissan Skyline 350GT Coupe for you JDM/Ozzie types.) I am at my happiest, I am most in the moment when I am at 9/10ths coming into the Canada Corner at Road America with the VQ and its Greddy exhaust roaring, the Yoko R-DOTs squealing and the course marshals edging behind the nearest guard rails. I finish every event exhausted and ready to fall out but also with a big grin and much larger appreciation of life.

Eric Bana is crazy that way. He has a mint (real) Ford Falcon that is beyond modded to the gills for the track (no equivalent in the USA since the original Falcon design from the USA had long since been abandoned. This Falcon is NOT your Dad's Falcon!) He looks the happiest, he is most in the moment when sliding that big monster into a Targa turn with 600 horsepower trumpeting off the far-too-near trees and guardrails with his friend and Navigator shrinking into his seat. He finishes each event totally satisfied and can go back to his career as a film actor with that much more appreciation for life.

The love and dedication to a life with cars drips from every frame (pixel?) of this movie. The story of a young Eric thinking his mates' dad was his mate and showing off the acceleration and bouncing the car off its' suspension much to the dismay of the poor pop is priceless. Love The Beast is full of such wonderful stories, whether they come from the lips of celebrities like Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear or Jay Leno of the Tonight Show. What unites them/us all is a love of cars.

What also resounded for me was Eric loving a car so much that he can't sell it. It makes no sense to keep it, it increases expenses, it takes up space, it causes problems - but he/you/I just cannot part with something that reminds you of how intense and fulfilling and just damn fun life can be!

This all reminds me of a fellow car nuts wife telling me (and her hubby) that the only thing that had changed in her husband since they met as teenagers was that the amount of money he spent on cars - he was still the same grinning kid wanting to squeeze another second off a lap time or wanting to squeeze a couple more horsepower from an engine. It also reminds me of taking my friend out on an autocross run - she thought it was going to be a relatively calm swing around some pylons - what she got was 90 seconds of terror and enough invented expletives escaped her mouth to equal the previous three months output! But, she still loves shoes more than cars. Women! ;)

That wild, happy craziness is what this film describes and it inspires you as well - it is not just about a bunch of cars going fast, it is people living in the moment and enjoying themselves around the camp fire that their car has made for them. Very, very few films about cars - fact or fiction - have touched at the heart of what it means to crave automobiles and most especially performance automobiles. Love The Beast does that superbly.

Five stars - before I watched this film Eric Bana seemed to be a real nice guy - this film confirms that in spades and then some. Highly, highly recommended.",1368057600,,3397,4.348580441640379

3877125,5,B0029LD2PS,"Man and machine. It seems like a simple story, but it's not. This movie details the love affair film star Eric Bana has with his Ford Falcon XB Coupe( it's an Australian Ford if that name isn't familiar), that he bought at 15 and kept. This movie chronicles his relationship with his car, but also how the car strengthened the bond between him and his friends. From a rusty, worn out wreck to it's full fledged rebirth into a racing machine, it's an amazing story of a man, his friends and a car.

 For those of you not in to cars as a hobby, it gives you a bit of a window as to why car people love their cars. Why do us revheads, petrolheads, or whatever term you want to use, love our cars? They can't love us back, they are fully capable of killing us and they can get expensive quickly. I'm not a sports fan, so I don't understand why people get so worked up over sports. But I do understand the concept of ""for the love of the game"". We love driving, we love what it takes to get from point A to B. We love keeping our cars clean and running as a source of pride. Many of us believe machines have a soul of sorts.

Not so easy to explain, is it? Watching  this movie will bring it into a sharper focus. Fellow motorheads Jay Leno and Jeremy Clarkson make appearances, with Clarkson being his usual abrasive yet on point self.",1361404800,,1331,4.167315175097277

Bana and company are brilliant. I do have one major complaint, in that through most of the last third of the film I was watching through tears.

Easily one of the most true to life car movies ever made, an instant classic which should have won every award possible...my hat is off to the entire crew.

The documentary was very well delivered, and some of the family scenes had a great sense of genuineness without the reality TV goofiness.

We have all had those favorites and as they have become grains of sand in our life, it is Good to go back and look through them again.
Enjoyed the film bought a copy to send to another gear head.
Wonderful shopping experiance at Amazon, Good Job!

3877148,4,B0029LD2PS,"Very surprised by the quality of Eric Bana's first documentary.  For car fans (either late model or historic) this move is a must see.  I agree with a previous reviewers comments about sitting your gf/bf, wife, hubby whatever down with you to watch the movie and get a glimpse into the mind of a car fanatic.  Eric does a good job in connecting the link between the observed behaviors of the car nut and the psyche to help them (and potentially those close to them) understand why they share a deep seated passion for an inanimate object made of steel, leather and rubber. And why they must embrace this passion.  For a movie that was made on a budget, Eric does a good job blending in old family reels of film, in-car action shots of his 'beast' and interviews with some of the more well known car guys in the world.  While I'm not normally a fan of Dr Phill of his over-hyped appearances or even his own shows 'shock' content, he does a good job of helping connect some of the dots for why we do some of the things we do in a quality 1-1 interview.  Its a good buy and a movie that I think you'll watch multiple times over the years to help you feel better about your car addiction.",1276387200,,1184,4.263392857142857
3877149,5,B0029LD2PS,This movie totally transcends it's subject matter. I'm a huge car nut but the movie quickly becomes about so much more than a mans love for his car. It's more about the things that we are passionate about and how we can draw friends into us through our passions. It's about how the real love of a passion gives us zest for life. I've had a car in my garage for 15 years that has been waiting for me to rediscover my zest for life. After watching this movie I went to the garage that night and started giving it the respect it deserves. I'm happy to say this movie helped me find the passion that's been missing in my life foe far to long.,1275868800,4,638,4.112

I watch it not only to see Eric but to feel the passion and determination that I need sometimes to go forward. That rush that I need to take the next step. To go fearlessly.

8357918,5,B0029LD2PS,"If you are a car guy, this movie just makes sense. If not, it may shed a little light on why car guys can be so crazy about an inanimate object. Eric Bana is every man who ever had a car that meant something special. I can't think of another movie which is a more fitting tribute to a man and his car.",1471305600,,301,3.7936507936507935
8357919,5,B0029LD2PS,"I've been watching reruns of Top Gear, getting ready to  watch the new version (sadly, it's rubbish) and the Bana movie was mentioned  whsn Bana was driving the ""reasonably priced car"", so I rented it. As the movie mentioned, if you're not a motorhead, you can't understand the link between a man and his car. This is a wonderful production, which lets you feel that tie between Bana and his Aussie muscle car. When he wrecks it during a street race, you feel his pain. At the end, you don't know if he'll rebuild it again .. but you hope he will. Two thumbs up .. (going to the garage now to pat my beloved Miata).",1465430400,2,615,4.293103448275862
