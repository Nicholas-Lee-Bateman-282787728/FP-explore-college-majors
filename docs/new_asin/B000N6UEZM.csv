2757093,5,B000N6UEZM,"This is such a good little side story that any true fan or newcomer would enjoy. It is hilarious and adventurous. From stepping into action to stepping in poo-just buy it. It's good.

Squad 7(Kakashi, Sasuke, Sakura, and Naruto) are assigned a C-Rank mission to escort Shibuki to his home: the Land Hidden Behind/In the Waterfall. He is the so-called ""hero"" of their kage-less village, yet he is a comeplete coward. In his village, a village with no Kage, supreme ninja, they have hero water, water extracted from a sacred tree every 100 years to build up one's chakra,which fends off intruders. But a rogue ninja from the same village is after it. You will have to watch to see what happens. WIll Shibuki overcome himself and try to defeat someone who taught him everything he knows and who knows his every move, or will Naruto and the gang have to butt in.",1183680000,3,858,4.607843137254902
2757094,4,B000N6UEZM,"This seems to fall between the 2nd and 3rd seasons, before the Chunin Exam story arc but doesn't really have a specific timeframe stated. A good Naruto storyline. Nothing spectacular, but not disappointing either, just more Naruto. That's not a bad thing...",1181779200,17,257,5.142857142857143
2757095,4,B000N6UEZM,"This dvd should be considered a mini-movie.  It exsists outside of the series story arcs.  I think this a fun and dramatic story within the Naruto universe.  This dvd contains both the english televised version and the uncut original with japanese audio, which is always a pluse for me.  Any true Naruto fan would find this dvd to be a must have.",1181174400,11,346,4.532258064516129
2757096,2,B000N6UEZM,"I saw this in T.V (The 'Lost story) and it wasn't very good. It had a few laugh out loud moments, but other thne that it was very boring. Don't buy this movie. It was trash. It should of stayed lost.",1180915200,4,199,3.8780487804878048

2757176,4,B000N6UEZM,"Pretty fun story. My boys have watched it a few times now. These side stories are a fun look at the in-between times. If you're a fan, you'll like it. If you're just starting out I'd say get to know the characters a bit through the show before jumping into this. You'll appreciate it more if you have some background in Naruto's story.",1368748800,,335,4.333333333333333

2757180,4,B000N6UEZM,This was a very nice story. Kakashi isn't in it much though. its Naruto and Sasuke's time to shine! The story moves along well and the characters stay true to form in this lost episode as well. It was fun to watch.,1360540800,,214,4.119047619047619

2757183,3,B000N6UEZM,"Everything I read about this DVD/Manga Pack lead me to believe it was a manga of the story described in the DVD.  However, as it turns out, it's the first volume of Naruto.  Save your money and just buy the movie by itself.  Otherwise, this is a great DVD.",1271030400,4,256,4.183673469387755
2757218,3,B000N6UEZM,"People don't seem to know what this is, I don't think there really is such a thing as a 'lost episode'. This 40 minute episode is really just a video which was only shown at a special Japanese event called Jump Fiesta. This was never, and probably will never, be shown on TV, as it is not part of the Naruto saga really. You should be happy that something only shown at Japans exclusive Jump Fiesta screenings is dubbed and released so people who don't know Japanese or live in Japan can watch it!

The episode/movie/OVA isn't really that exciting though. It's not terrible, but the jokes weren't particularly funny and it was all predictable. I'm happy it was released in Australia with a bonus Jump Fiesta short ""Naruto: Find the Crimson Four-Leaf Clover!"" :) It was slightly better than this waterfall one.",1230940800,2,809,4.6573426573426575
2757219,4,B000N6UEZM,"The Lost Story is a 40 minute special episode that sees Naruto and the other Genin Ninja escorting Shibuki, the young leader of the Waterfall Village back to his home. Seems like a pretty straight forward mission, yet predictably the mission soon becomes complicated. Shibuki's Village is attacked by the outcast Suien who is after the hidden waterfall treasure ""Hero's Water"" which increases the users chakra tenfold.
What follows is a stand alone Naruto feature that runs for the length of about 2 episodes. Despite the short length, this OVA (original video animation) manages to fit in plenty of action, comedy and some morals about courage and responsibility as Naruto has to show Shibuki what it means to be a true Hero.

The action is pretty decent with some nice fight scenes and jutsus, which are nicely animated by the studio pierrot. Fans of the series will recognise all of the music as it is all recycled from the TV series.
Love it or Hate it, I only watch the english dub of Naruto, and I was impressed as usual with the quality. Fans of the series may recognise that the voice of Shibuki has been done by Steve Staley, the voice of Neji Hyuga in the series. I was pleasantly surprised with this as he is actually one of my favourite voice actors having provided voices for Heat Guy J, Tenjho Tenge and Buso Renkin.

Newcomers to the series may feel lost while watching this one so it is better to check out the television series beforehand. The Lost Story is definetly NOT the best Naruto DVD out, and it doesn't set out to be either... It doesn't really provide anything new in terms of character development or story, it is just a nice addition to any Naruto fans collection. So if you're looking for that extra bit of Naruto fixation after watching the series then you should check this DVD out.",1226880000,,1814,4.613003095975232
2757220,3,B000N6UEZM,I bought this item a little while ago and haven't watched it since. It's plot strays from the main plot of the series. It also took to long for it to get moving and it seemed like the battles dragged on and on. But there were a couple parts where I laughed pretty hard. It's worth the money but don't expect anything too great. 3 out of 5 stars!,1213142400,,345,4.0144927536231885
2757221,5,B000N6UEZM,My son loved these dvd movies and I would recommend them to anyone with children.  The quality of the movies are A+.,1211328000,,116,4.2727272727272725
2757222,1,B000N6UEZM,"Ok this one might just just be one of the worst Naruto movies ever. No Kakashi, no 9 Tailed Fox, no sharigan. Just some stupid water. So yeah basically this was a waste of time.",1210723200,4,177,4.085714285714285
2757223,3,B000N6UEZM,"The lost episode unfortunately should have stayed lost, not a very interesting story or fight scene.  i wouldnt recomend it but if you're a die hard naruto fan like me, don't take my word for it, see it yourself",1203638400,2,211,4.410256410256411
2757224,4,B000N6UEZM,"Only two types of people should watch this OVA... Hardcore Naruto fans, and possibly people that have never seen Naruto and want a preview of what the series has to offer. If you hate Naruto, you'll hate this. If you don't mind Naruto, you won't mind this, but you'll wish you didn't buy it. This OVA is purely worth the money for hardcore Narutards. And with saying that... I'm glad I brought it. It's a good fix for fans of Naruto wanting just some good dumb Naruto fun.

Taking place between the Zabuza arc and the Chunin Exams arc, it offers nothing new... but if you like what Naruto already offered at that time, you'll like this.

Coming from a hardcore Naruto fan... I'd give it a B.",1199318400,4,691,4.390625
2757225,1,B000N6UEZM,"When I first read it, I was hoping they made a video about how Kakashi got his Sharingan, since it wasn't covered in the anime but was in the manga, and is therefore missing from the main section.  Instead we get this tripe, another chance for Naruto to show off instead of something actually interesting, characters other than the main doing ninja battles.  I mean, this is what was so cool about the Hokage's last battle, it showed how top class ninjas react, rather than amateur Naruto using shadow clones.",1192579200,5,509,4.644444444444445
2757226,2,B000N6UEZM,"I am a Naruto fan somewhat, and I had high hopes for this. However, it fell short of my expectations. The story is about Naruto and the rest of his team escorting a cowardly leader named Shibuki to his village, but things get mixed up when an old enemy named Suien appears in the village and tries to steal it's treasure, the Hero's Water. While this may seem exciting, it's actually quite boring once you actually watch it. Naruto and Shibuki talk for an extended period of time, which takes out a lot. So far, this is bad. Very bad.

I won't spoil anything, but if you're a Sakura fan, don't buy this. She's tied up half the time. While the fight scenes are at least decent to good, they don't last long enough to hold your attention for very long, Thus comes to the conclusion of my review. It may seem good to some people, but to most, it's just some practical joke created for a good series. A very bad pratical joke.",1188259200,7,922,4.2988505747126435
2757227,3,B000N6UEZM,"Though it fell a little short of my expectations, it might have been better if it was released to the American market at an earlier date, I did like the DVD much better than when it aired on Cartoon Network and would recommend that Fans of the show add this disc to their collection.

For those looking for answers to certain questions raised during the show this doesn't have any. It also doesn't build on any other story lines the show has produced.

What this OVA does offer is another adventure showing Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura using their skills in ways that have become common. Apparently this takes place sometime after the third Hokage dies, but there is no mention of his death.",1184198400,3,689,4.59349593495935

8175153,4,B000N6UEZM,"this story is a good one, its to bad that it didn't make it to being air in the series. Naruto and the team are sent to a small village to protect its leader. when a former ninja of that village returns to take a jug of special water Naruto most remind this young leader that anyone can be a hero by trying to face their fears.",1510185600,,327,3.8955223880597014

8175157,5,B000N6UEZM,"i am a forever naruto fan, this show holds such lovely memories for me, i was a loner without any friends for the longest time, and in my youth i saw the series on tv for the first time and i could not keep my eyes off of it, but eventually the broadcasting of the show was canceled on the air, and i hadn't even learned the name of the show. I had never seen it again for 4 years, when i told a person about it, trying to find out what the name was. That person not only opened my case, but she also opened my eyes to a whole other universe of anime. She became my first true friend and through her i met other people like me. the deeper i got into the anime universe the more friends i made, and i was finally happy for the first time in my life. Due to my other issues in life i was able to relate to naruto in several ways, i was put into foster care for most of my life, so i knew what it felt like to not be wanted, or need or loved, and it wasn't until one person who cared enough about me to take me into her family that i was able to see a little light. Also i was born with a physical abnormality, a cleft palate and because of it i was shunned by my school mates and i was all alone for quite some time and that didn't make my life any better, until that one person who became my first friend out of our similar favoritism of this show. I love Naruto and i will never forget just how much it has changed my life for the better. Thank You Misashi Kishimoto for creating such a wonderful manga and anime.",1450224000,,1513,3.8681672025723475
