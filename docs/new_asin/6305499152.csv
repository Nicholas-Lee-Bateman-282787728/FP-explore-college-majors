7891996,5,6305499152,"I am not very familiar with all the different power rangers incarnations, but I picked this one up recently for my son who has developed a liking for all things power ranger. I was pleasantly surprised at how different this one was from others we have seen together. The power rangers in costume don't even make an appearance until more than half way through the movie.

This one takes place in the future, and Earth is apparently at was somewhere in space, the details aren't clear. The five who will eventually become the power rangers all make it in one way or the other to a distant planet, where special swords that have been laying in wait for thousands of years chooses them to be the new rangers.

Normally, I find that the show is cheesy and melodramatic, but this one took itself a little bit more seriously. My wife said it reminded her of starship troopers, but I wouldn't go that far. Interestingly enough, even thought its the best I've seen, my son (age 5) was not as into it as he was Power Rangers Samurai, for example",1399766400,,1035,4.470899470899471

7891998,5,6305499152,"Back in 1999, The Power Ranger series was basically reaching its peek with creative plotlines with the multicolored laytex characters portrayed by actors who haven't been teenagers in who knows how long. You probably won't be seeing them in any other shows or movies (except maybe Archie Kao - who has appeared on an episode of ""CSI: Crime scene investigation"" and in a few episodes the newer seasons of the Hospital Drama ""ER"") besides other later Power Ranger series. If anything, I was beginning to reach the teenage years. Although I was far off from it, my interest in Power Rangers was waning because naturally I mentally instilled in my mind that I had seen all that Power Rangers had to offer. After The ""PR In Space"" series, I was basically ready to look at something else. FOX-KIDS and Saban managed to reel me back in with yet another space incarnation of Power Rangers called ""Power Rangers Lost Galaxy"" (notably mis-titled as ""Power Rangers in the lost galaxy""). The show basically focused on the adventurous teenager Leo Corbett - (Danny Slavin) and his galaxy hopping mishaps through the universe on the space colony Terra Venture. The series followed more closely to its Japanese counterpart ""Super Sentai: Gingaman"" & lasted about 45 episodes before ending with 3 part finale. The story goes like this: Leo Corbett stowaways on a shuttle to Terra Venture (against his brother's wishes if memory serves) and ends up in training program on the moon where he runs into his brother Mike Corbett after meeting Kindrex and Kai. Upon being reprimanded by his big brother, a portal opens up and a girl dressed in practical rags comes tumbling out begging for help to boot.

The girl, Mya (Cerina Vincent) pleads for help for her planet Mirinoi who is under attack by a creature by the name of Furio and Mike decides to oblige to her pleads and help her out, but wants Leo back on a shuttle to earth [I think]. Naturally, things don't work out  the way anyone wants them to and Leo follows his big brother through the portal with Kai hot on his tail. From there the storyline and plot springs off into several different sagas/arcs (Leo Corbett becomes the Red Galaxy Ranger, Kai Chen, The blue galaxy ranger, Kindrex Morgan, The pink galaxy ranger - Mya, The yellow galaxy ranger - and Damon, (Reggie Rolle) The green galaxy ranger) that aren't properly explained until halfway near the end of the series. While ""Lost Galaxy"" may not have been the most popular in the Power Ranger series, it held more of a --dare I say it -- mature atmosphere to it, and is the only series that kills several of its main characters, thus reintroducing one character from ""Power Rangers in Space."" Leo's brother Mike Corbett becomes the Magna Defender later on in the series.

While its almost downright hard to watch Lost Galaxy now without going red in the face or laughing, I've noticed that inbetween the episodes there were a lot of pointless character/filler episodes (Double Duty, Green Courage, Blue to the test, Loyax' Last Battle, A red romance, etc.), and only one episode that gave me the creeps as a kid (The Rescue Mission. In which Mike, Leo, and the GSA military force answer a distress call from abandoned shuttle drifting through space. The only episode in which the characters don't transform). Most of the episode arcs that spanned over 2/3 episodes. The ""THE LOST GALAXY/CAPTAIN MUTINY"" arcs that spanned over three or more episodes were probably the most boring arcs because it took them maybe longest time to get through, though it cannot be denied that it did tie up loose ends within the show. The acting is the usual B-movie type acting. The music didn't help the dramatic scenes much either, I just found myself brought to tears trying not to giggle at the US voiceovers dailouge (which was probably the silliest I'ver heard. A trademark for Power Rangers) when the Japanese actors were in the power ranger costumes.  That's not to say that LG didn't have good moments in when the acting never seemed B-moveish (most of the time provided by Russell Lawrence/Mike, Archie Kao/Kai, and Valerie Vernon/Kendrix. Aside from commander and the higher ranker officer that was shown in the 3 part finale. ""Then Terra venture will freeze."" woman. But the others  do a bang-up job themselves) that even surprised my older self --- I never paid much attention to the acting as a kid---, that was few and far between basically. The martial arts and fighting was/is the best part of the show, its the reason you watched the teenagers transform into their colorful personas even though watching men dressed up as the big monsters fighting the Power Rangers is something to laugh at.

The characters have more of dynamics to them than the previous characters of previous Power Rangers seasons (Excluding Mighty Morphin, Turbo, and Space. These seasons included Ninja Storm/Dino Thunder/S.P.D./Light Speed Rescue, etc.); There is a dramatic atmosphere with the teenage heroes of Terra Venture, especially with Leo Corbett. He's the red galaxy ranger that carries the weight of his responsibility as leader - the supposed death of his brother - and blaming himself for almost every mishap that happens to his comrades, its more or less like a soap opera mixed into the series. The most characters that get the least attention are Daemon and Mike, who have less character/personality in the series because the storyline focuses so much more on the Red - Blue - Pink (no. 1 - Kendrix Morgan) - Yellow - Trakeena (Amy Miller) and her father's ---Scorpius--- exploits to destroy them. Which is sort of a sad thing when you get tired of the Red/Blue/Pink/Yellow drama episodes. The animation was naturally low budget and poor. I wonder if put any effort into the animation or did just make something up and slapped onto the screen along with the live action? This will forever remain a mystery to me. But all in all ""Power Rangers Lost Galaxy"" has shaped up to be my absolute favorite out of the previous seasons of POWER RANGERS. I only pray FOX HOME VIDEO decides to put all 13+ seasons of Power Rangers according to episode, on DVD soon before anyone who has watched it is gone with the wind. This VHS contains four or more episodes from the beginning of the season of PRLG ((Quasar Quest, Quasar Quest (2), Race to the Rescue, Rookie in Red)). Its been awhile since I've seen any of them, but if my memory serves me correctly they were pretty good and left me giddy for months when I was younger anyway. Now its just a nice feeling of nostalgia. ---------[a 5 out 5]",1125878400,,6565,4.769569041336851
7891999,4,6305499152,"This video is pretty good, but the action is nowhere near the action-packed first and second movie. This does have its bad moments, but all in all, it's pretty good. It explains everything (pretty much) and has no huge plotholes. Speaking of plot...
Leo Corbett stows away in a space settlement called Terra Venture and is on the run. Acidentally, he bumps into Kendrix Morgan and Kai Chen, two GSA officials. When asked by police, Kendrix makes excuses but doesn't answer Kai's own questions. Long story short, Leo stows away again on a training exercise and saves Kendrix's life, Kendrix and Kai's commanding officer Mike (guess) Corbett tells Leo off for following him, a portal opens up and a girl called Maya falls through. Mike and Kendrix investigate her world but Leo jumps in at the last second. What will happen? That's for me to know, and you to find out. So get the movie!",1002844800,2,884,4.709677419354839
7892000,2,6305499152,"Seems that Haim Saban can never stop those ""Power Rangers"" from being on the air. Even with all those new monsters and characters and improved special effects, he hasn't really regained the popularity he had in the beginning, except with his more recent Digimon. The PR came to America in 1993 and immediately they were a major hit. Austin St. John, Thuy Trang, and Walter Emmanuel Jones, however, left the show in 1995 because they were dissatisfied with payment (them greedy cowards!); thus, Karan Ashley, Steven Cardenas, and Johnny Yong Bosch took over. The release of the first Power Rangers movie in summer 1995 thus didn't do well at the box office at all, our once favorite superheroes were going downhill. Making subsequent spin-offs didn't help.
Now what? First they were the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (everyone knows who they were), then they transformed into Zeo, shifted into turbo, conquered space, forged through lost galaxies, and traveled at the spped of light to the rescue. Now, there'll be ""Time Force"" like, next month, but I don't think it'll be any more fun than Lost Galaxy may have been. Power Rangers in Space (1998) was SO much better than that. What the heck....it's 2001 and with the Digimon garnering high ratings on Nielsen like mad (yet their movie wasn't very successful either), what WILL be these guys' future? I guess there won't be no future for them now that they're no longer #1. Even the mystic knights of tir na nog were never the popular warriors the PR were. I don't care anymore. It's only a TV show.",978652800,2,1547,4.797752808988764
7892001,4,6305499152,"This tape is a bit short, running just under an hour, but if you're interested in seeing how the Lost Galaxy Rangers came to be, it's worth the purchase.  The only downside is since the tape doesn't run very long, you don't get to see the full range of the Rangers' powers and their Zords' abilities.  To see that, you should check out the Power Rangers Lost Galaxy Video, The Return of The Magna Defender, which is 90 minutes long, and more bang for your buck.  But for a Power Rangers fan, this tape is worth the buy.",976060800,3,519,4.275510204081633
7892002,5,6305499152,"I haven't seen this video, but I have seen the original airing of the first three episodes this tape contains.  But know this, this isn't the Power Rangers you might expect.  When the series debuted in 1993, it drew the attention of the public because of its fast pace, uniqueness and likable characters.  But, despite all that, it was really a kid's show.  This fact was vagued with this incarnation of the series.
  When Power Rangers:Lost Galaxy debuted in 1999, it had a diferent look.  It seemed more mature.  Yes, the flash and extreme pacing of action was still there, but a sense of a more adult storyline followed suit.  Decent storytelling along with a semi-solid science-fiction background, caused this series to be quite enjoyable. In short, this version of the series finaly forced a seven year franchise to grow up a little.  With a little open-mindness, adults might discover this tape/series to be a very enjoyable guilty pleasure for themselves and kids alike",969753600,7,976,4.896341463414634
7892003,5,6305499152,"This series is so extreem, it's almost as awsome as Star Wars. It has awsome special effects, awsome action, great villains, and great rangers. I'm glad to see that the Power Rangers are now into the more modern age  now. Watch Power Rangers Lost galaxy. You may or may not give it 5 stars  but I did.",952732800,,301,4.2631578947368425
