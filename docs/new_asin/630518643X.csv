7886169,4,630518643X,I remember seeing the movie on cable and enjoyed it. I'd like to see it again but why in the HELL is it so damn expensive? It was a good movie but far from great.  Why is this always so ridiculously priced?  Makes zero sense.,1501286400,,225,3.977777777777778

7886171,4,630518643X,"Jeez! Someone torrent this crap already! No movie is worth that much , unless it the original print of say Casablanca!

Greedy people, it's only softcore porn! Sure that ONE seen is very hot (if you love Kari Wuhrer)  but man All her movies should be available for free by now on the internet. Ashame noone is archiving them.",1183248000,,325,4.491525423728813
7886172,3,630518643X,It is a movie for Kari fans although it is not bad!! It is an adventure that shows how a woman can influence a man and it is my first time to see a woman on a high speed truck trying to kick the driver's a** instead of a man as usual...Interesting! Also Kari is really hot ans even for the female viewers the protagonist is said to be cute..i don't but my female friends say so! A nice movie to have anyway...,1036713600,4,409,3.9397590361445785
7886173,2,630518643X,"Exploitation movies get redefined every ten years or so. Changing tastes is not so much the reason as the changing ways to deliver this stuff to its public. In the era of direct to-video, and made-for (late night) cable, the  genre has become fragmented, but prospered as well.
One consistency  throughout the ages is the need for a sexy woman-she needs to act a bit,  but not too much because her actions should always speak louder than her  words.
Kari Wuhrer, once of MTV's Remote Control, is moving to the  forefront here, She's a better actress than Shannon Whirry, younger, hipper  than Shannon Tweed. Keep an eye out for her.
At 86 minutes ""Hot Blooded""  as it was titled for DVD is not a major waste of time. And if you keep your  finger near the `fast forward' button you can probably cut the time spent  in half.
As for David Keith, your 10 or so minutes are not worth whatever  pittance they paid you. Step up to the plate son, or step away all  together.",952732800,11,966,4.431818181818182
7886174,4,630518643X,"The plot is pretty lame, but if you like Mustangs and sexy ladies, this movie shows many scenes with a green '68 Mustang fastback {Bullett clone} and the very sexy Kari Wuhrer.",944956800,8,176,4.53125
