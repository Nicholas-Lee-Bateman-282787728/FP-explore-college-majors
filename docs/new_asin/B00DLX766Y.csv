5832174,4,B00DLX766Y,"This DVD is a great introduction to some yoga poses and stretches, for those unfamiliar or beginning with yoga; more advanced yoga is found elsewhere, this is a DVD of sessions to calm, stretch and yoga exercise, intended more for those just starting or restarting in yoga.  The sessions are a great length, the instructor seems knowledgeable, and I really enjoyed this exercise DVD: would recommend!",1383436800,,400,5.0606060606060606
5832175,5,B00DLX766Y,"I have never done yoga.  But I have heard good things about it and wanted to check it out.  This DVD offers yoga positions for strength and flexibility, and also has a section related to meditation.  I believe this is a great vehicle to introduce myself to yoga through the guidance of a great teacher.",1383350400,,302,4.454545454545454
5832176,3,B00DLX766Y,"My teenage daughters and I have been enjoying the Yoga for Strengh and Flexibility DVD. I have done yoga on and off for years but my daughters are new to it so this DVD worked well for us. I like that we can choose just the flexibility or strength sessions for a shorter workout. The flexibility has been espeically nice to do in the evening to help us wind down. But when we have time for a full workout, we can do both sessions together. The instructor was easy to follow and had a nice calming voice. THe flexibility was a little disappointing to my daughters who are working their way into the splits that there wasn't more hip/leg flexibility. A pigeon pose would have been nice. But the DVD is enjoyable enough.",1383177600,,717,4.398496240601504
5832177,5,B00DLX766Y,"I haven't practiced yoga in many years and have been looking for a place to start. This DVD is it. I started last week and rotate between the two sessions. I am not (yet) able to do it well, but I am doing it. She makes it look so easy! I like that she explains alternate (easier) ways of performing some of the moves, that helps. If I fall behind or am unable to do something I can pick up in a minute or two, so I am not totally lost like with some videos. Perhaps in 6 months or a year this may be ""too easy"" but I am happy with it right now. I  also love the background, I wish that was my yard!!!",1383091200,,601,3.7698412698412698
5832178,5,B00DLX766Y,"Both the strength and the flexibility segments live up to their names. The good thing about it is that if you have the time, you can do a good all around yoga routine.  When you don't, an approximately 30 minute workout is better than no yoga at all.  It is an intermediate level routine.  As another reviewer stated, it's not impossible, but in the strength section, you will work up a sweat.  I have done all four of Ashley Turner's available Element yoga DVDs.  In order from most challenging to least challenging, I would rank them Power Yoga, Yoga for Strength & Flexibility (this one), Yoga for Weight Loss, and then Yoga for Flexibility and Stress Relief.",1382918400,,662,4.6239316239316235
5832179,4,B00DLX766Y,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can read a more complete version of my review on that site.

Yoga instructor Ashley Turner has been featured in several previous Element yoga videos, including another DVD with a title very similar to this one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Yoga-for-Stress-Relief-Flexibility/dp/B00429C1W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility</a>.  This DVD has two routines of approximately 30 minutes in length, with Turner practicing alone in an attractive poolside garden setting showcasing the Pacific ocean in the background. She teaches via voiceover and provides mirrored cuing, using a combination of Sanskrit and English terminology.  Her only prop is her yoga mat, and throughout each practice, she mentions modifications for some of the postures (sometimes shown in inset).

The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following options:

*Play Yoga for Strength

*Play Yoga for Flexibility

*Play Meditation

I have broken down each of the practices in greater detail below (times are approximate).

YOGA FOR STRENGTH (33.5m)

Turner begins standing, with a focus on breath and setting an intention (sankalpa).  For a warm-up, she performs some neck rolls.  Coming to the head of the mat, she moves from a forward bend to plank to side plank, with long holds of the latter on either side.  Transitioning through low cobra and down dog, Turner comes to a lying position for core work, including several variations of crunch/leg lower moves with the legs in the air.  Following the core work, Turner rocks up to a squat position and then into a standing forward bend.  Next is a crescent lunge series where Turner moves in and out of the lunge, adding arm movements, and then continuing into warrior 3 and standing splits.  She performs a chair sequence before repeating the crescent series on the second side.  Turner concludes the standing work with warrior 2 and side angle postures.  She then returns to the floor for what she calls ""bow"" pose (actually a version of locust) and more abdominal work, lowering and lifting into boat pose.  Returning to the back, she performs boat pose with the option of going up into wheel ""if you are familiar with the pose.""  The final posture is a cross-leg twist, and Turner concludes the practice with a short (1 minute) savasana before returning to seated for an affirmation and single ""ohm.""

YOGA FOR FLEXIBILITY (31.5m)

Turner again opens by initiating ujjayi breathing and engaging in a few stretches, including neck rolls, arm rolls, and side bends.  She then encourages setting a sankalpa that focuses on flexibility, and she chants a single ""ohm.""  Continuing the standing warm-ups, she moves from standing to a squat position to generate some heat, then performs hip circles.  Using a half sun salutation, she transitions to hands and knees.  From this position, Turner moves through thread-the-needle, cat/cow, leg extensions, and hydrant hip circles.  Next she starts with runner's lunge, comes up to pyramid pose, and then opens up into triangle pose.  For the second side, she takes these postures in reverse order, and the transitions felt awkward to me.  Wide-legged stretches follow, including an inner thigh stretch and a twist; Turner then gradually moves into lateral splits.  The final postures include revolved head-to-knee and twisting forward bend.  This time, the affirmation is included as part of the savasana (1.5 minutes) before concluding seated.

MEDITATION (7.5m)

This is a guided, mindfulness-based meditation practice.  Turner provides instruction for finding a comfortable seated position and arranging the hands comfortably as well.  She encourages use of a ""witness mind"" throughout the practice.  Turner recommends engaging in meditation on a daily basis.

As an instructor, Turner is pleasant and encouraging.  While her practices do not provide a level of teaching that would be sufficient for those completely new to yoga, these routines are likely to appeal to yoga students within a wide range of experience levels.  Personally, I did not enjoy the overall flow of the practices on this DVD, which was disappointing since I do particularly like Turner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Yoga-for-Stress-Relief-Flexibility/dp/B00429C1W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility</a>.  However, this may be an idiosyncratic preference--other users may find that they prefer this newer release.",1380153600,23,4639,5.588825214899713
5832180,5,B00DLX766Y,"I have just started doing yoga and found that it helped with my back and neck problems.  I started doing the Ashley Turner Element Yoga For Strength And Flexibility hoping it would relieve some of my neck and shoulder, plus lower back problems.  Right after the first workout, I could notice my shoulders were not as tense and sore..  i am at the age where osteoperosis is a huge problem so I need to do everything I can possibly do to prevent this.

The one thing I liked about Ashley as an instructor is she doesn't go so fast that I can't keep up with her.  She gave me a very intense workout.  I could feel my abs and back muscles responding to stretches designed for specific areas.  After I am healed, I will continue to do yoga for maintenance.

She has a couple of other DVDs I am interested in like the Element Power Yoga.. and for my Hubs there is one for weight loss.",1378252800,2,878,4.246987951807229

I consider myself an advanced exerciser, and I have been looking for an alternative to using weights to mix up my strength training.  While there is not much for arms and shoulders, this Strength segment has some great core work and the leg work is killer.  Ashley's narration is perfect - good cueing, no silly conversation.",1467331200,2,393,4.666666666666667

I was looking for a quick (~30mins) and challenging power yoga workout to include in my bodyweight training and the Strength section of this DVD fits the bill perfectly. The Flexibility portion is gentler but also much appreciated and I tend to do that one on rest days. For a longer workout (~60mins) using this type of yoga, try the Element: Power Yoga DVD from this same instructor. The two are my all-time favorite workout DVDs and doing one or the other about 5x a week on top of my daily cardio has got me in the best shape of my life.",1454889600,,621,4.504424778761062

5832201,4,B00DLX766Y,"I was looking for a short yoga DVD for busy days; this one has two 30  min. programs, and a short guided meditation.  I like both workouts, and the meditation is relaxing..  The workouts are not a flowy-type of practice, like I've done at studios, or like you get from Baron Baptiste, full of sun salutations and traditional yoga poses.  They are more like a series of exercises (or stretches in the flexibility workout).  I definitely felt the strength segment in my arms the next day from all the ""yoga push-ups"" and there's some good core work on that one, too.

Ashley Turner has a nice soothing voice and I didn't find her at all annoying.  She is the only one in the DVD.  There are no models showing beginner or advanced variations, but Ashley does demonstrate some modifications along the way.

This probably won't be my ""go to"" yoga DVD, but I'll use it on days I need a little Zen, or use the flex segment at night to relax before bed.",1424649600,,945,4.416184971098266

5832204,4,B00DLX766Y,"I got this DVD to try to learn Yoga at home. I have some significant health issues from various injuries over the years and wanted to try to build my strength and stamina at my own pace. I found the various instructions to be relatively simple and fairly easy to follow. I can't do all of the things that are shown in the videos, but the ones that I can do, seem to be helping me make the gains that I wanted in both strength and flexibility.

I intend to continue these lessons and hope that I'll be physically able to do all of the exercises some day. Others have mentioned that these instructions aren't for a novice and perhaps that is true. Perhaps that is why I can't do all of the exercises. I don't know, but as a complete Yoga novice, I'm happy with these DVDs.",1412208000,,770,4.202702702702703

5832206,5,B00DLX766Y,I have 4 Ashley Turner yoga dvds (6 workouts) and have been pleased with all of them! I have a lot less pain and tension in my body than I used to and her method makes it easy to finish the whole workout and not feel like I have to do it perfectly or be a spiritual guru.,1406678400,,271,3.689655172413793
5832207,5,B00DLX766Y,Just as expected.,1405296000,,17,5.0
5832208,5,B00DLX766Y,"I love Ashley Turner's dvd-s. This is my third one, and I've very happy with my results. The changes in my mind and body are unbelievable.
First I want to say that this dvd is not for beginners, as it is fairly intense and challenging. The first time I tried the program I was sweating bullets and sighing quite a lot- I've been regularly practicing yoga for about 4-5 years now, 3 times a week on average, just to give you an idea, so if you are looking for something for beginners, Ashley has ""Yoga for stress relief and flexibility"", which would be more appropriate.
This dvd has 3 parts which you can use in one session or separately. 2 parts are workouts- about 30 minutes each, and then you have a meditation. I prefer doing one workout at a time+ meditation. From the title you can tell that one session is more ""strength"" focused- a lot more exercising, moving fast, trying harder, the flexibility is more about stretching,m which is fairly intense too. Both programs are very balanced, and you can totally get ALL your muscles to shape nicely and your mind to be stronger too. I am actually amazed at how my body has transformed with this, never looked better. If you do everything right, and listen to the instructor, you'll get toned fast.
Highly recommend this DVD, and other programs with Ashley Turner!",1401753600,7,1316,4.580508474576271
5832209,5,B00DLX766Y,"Love Ashley Turner.  She always gives a great workout and in a lovely surrounding, outdoors and with some soft music to soothe the nervous system.  I would say that this routine is just a little easier than her DVD for stress relief and flexibility.  All in all however I am glad to have it in my collection and will use if often.  I always feel renewed whenever I work with Ashley.  There is a guided meditation at the end which makes for a good ending to either of the two workouts, but it is optional.  It seems appropriate for some beginners and most intermediate students.
Namaste.",1396828800,,586,4.481132075471698
5832210,5,B00DLX766Y,Each pose is held long enough for her to describe how to get in the pose and how it should feel. Then she moves on to the next one; she's very direct and to the point! None of this twenty minute long pose with a speech about the great universe like other videos. This is the perfect instruction video!,1395619200,,301,4.11864406779661
5832211,5,B00DLX766Y,"I really liked this yoga DVD. The strength section included but was not limited to: planks, side arm balances, warrior three and some great core poses. Ashley gives modifications if the poses are too advanced but does not go into great detail about the particulars of the poses. I think a little exposure to yoga is necessary for this section. I would recommend it for Advance Beginner and Intermediate yogis.

The flexibility section of the DVD opened up almost every part of my body - shoulders, hips, hamstrings - you name it. I think this section would be appropriate even if you have never done yoga before but is still a great practice if you're experience.

There is a bonus guided mediation section. I feared that by guided, it meant Ashley would ask you to picture a meadow or something cheesy like that. It's not that at all. She talks about letting thought go and not dwelling on them. I liked it.

This DVD will definitely go into my regular rotation of yoga DVDs!",1393372800,,976,4.597701149425287
5832212,5,B00DLX766Y,"Ashley turner is one of my favorites! I love her approach & flow in every one of her practices & she always knows what to say at the right time; they are all well thought & very unique. Her voice with the music is very nice & she packs a mean yogi workout. When it ends, I feel challenged yet satisfied.
The ""Strength"" practice is tough if you're a beginner. If you're looking for more of a vinyasa flow I'd recommend her ""Yoga for Weight Loss"" practice, even if weight loss isn't your #1 goal.",1393372800,,494,4.2105263157894735
5832213,5,B00DLX766Y,"I received this as a gift to help me overcome my limitations from hip surgery. I really like how Ms. Turner explains each pose and move. She goes slow so the inflexible can get into the positions. I do recommend doing her session for flexibility for as many days as you want until you feel not so ""shaky"" while in the poses and moves. She does express that if you can't move well don't force it, just relax and go as far as your body will let you. This, I like about this instruction DVD. The strength section I have not done yet, but I have watched it. I'm doing the flexibility section first then moving on once I feel less ""shaky"" and able to do all the moves and positions. **For those who are disappointed because it's not a power yoga or more in depth DVD, please realize this is mainly for the beginner.**  I recommend this DVD to any beginner!",1391817600,,851,4.253086419753086
5832214,5,B00DLX766Y,"I really like every single Element dvd I've tried.  This dvd provides a decently challenging Strength workout followed by a nice relaxing Flexibility session.  I love to do them back to back.  The first lets you work up a nice sweat whithout wearing you out followed by a nice soothing session that that leaves you feeling relaxed yet invigorated.

The instructor is clear and easy to follow and does a good job of focusing on breath and the more meditative side of yoga.  This is essential to me in a Yoga workout.

You will  need to have a basic understanding of poses and proper form but I think this is a great dvd for a wide range of people from beginner to advanced.  Highly recommended.",1389830400,,693,4.488
5832215,5,B00DLX766Y,"I have most of the element series, and I have all of Ashley Turner's. I thought the Power Yoga was the hardest, boy was I wrong. Although the Power Yoga series was almost an hour long and incorporated more vinyasa, the strength portion of this video alone was harder. What I enjoyed was that not only in 30 mins can you get a more powerful workout, but that it also really concentrates on the core and glutes. The next two days I was sore from head to toe, and I practice yoga 4 times a week and run no less than 3 miles at a time. So I'd say that even if you are in decent shape, this video will kick your butt. No it is NOT for beginners, but I like that about it. This is the video to give those pesky friends, husbands, or brothers that don't believe yoga can be a challenging workout. I made my brother do this video to prove it's worth and he was huffing and puffing. I haven't fully used the flexibility part yet because I'm so worn out after the strength series, but I just absolutely love it. It does lack some of the yoga familiarity of warm ups and sun salutes etc. However it is definitely a nice addition to rotate in for a challenging day. I think a follow up of flexibility after the strength portion could be just about the perfect session. On a more stressful day I might stick to power yoga or yoga for weight loss instead, but this one rocks.",1389052800,4,1361,4.159090909090909
5832216,5,B00DLX766Y,I love Ashely Turner's yoga style. I have her other two DVDs and this one is just as great as the previous two. I look forward to buying any of her future DVDS.,1388620800,,160,3.878787878787879
5832217,5,B00DLX766Y,I have 3 yoga videos by element and they are all great.  The poses are explained really well and they aren't so difficult that only experts could do them yet they are challenging.  I highly recommend them.,1387670400,,205,4.513513513513513
5832218,4,B00DLX766Y,"Yoga for Strength & Flexibility consists of:  1. Strengthening, focusing on core (30 minutes); 2. Flexibility and range of motion (30 minutes), and  3. Guided meditation (8 minutes).

This video isn't for the absolute beginner.  However, if you've had even five beginner yoga classes you can roll through it, albeit slowly,  (pause, play, as needed).  There are modifications for your fitness level, allowing everyone to perform the exercises.  Instructor Ashley Turner makes everything look easy, so keep in mind fluidity is the goal, not expectation; she's the expert.

I've been practicing yoga, on and off. or about six years. At first viewing, I found Turner's narration a bit difficult to understand; her diction and modulation could be better.  After running through the program once,  my future practices were intuitive.

One qualm I have is with the limited number of basic sun salutations and warm-up poses.  The video is meant to be brief, but it's just something to keep in mind if your body isn't used to the exercises or you aren't practicing regularly.  She does make sure to mention the all-important proper positioning for each pose (shoulders over elbows over wrist, etc.), which prevent injury and ensure that you're getting the full benefit of each pose.

The brief, guided meditation is a nice addition and distinguishes this video from the hard- core, physically-oriented practice.  The idea is that you feel calmer, more focused and in control, if your mind is centered through meditation, rather than worrying about achieving absolute perfection in each pose.  About meditation . . . . try it before you judge it.

""Yoga for Strength & Flexibility"" is useful for a person who has had some training with a live instructor and wishes to supplement classes with more guided flow at home.  Even someone who has quit for a while and is just getting back into the yoga could benefit from this video. It's convenient to have a personal trainer in your home, even if it's on screen, and the beach setting is so relaxing.",1387411200,,2036,4.9733727810650885
5832219,3,B00DLX766Y,"I've done yoga sessions at multiple studios throughout my town, and while my attendance is too sporadic for me to be considered anything but a beginner, I do have a sense of what a traditional yoga workout is.  This isn't it.  This is yoga as a workout, designed specifically to make you sweat.

The DVD has two main programs, one for strength and one for flexibility.  The strength workout was surprisingly intense; I was sweating and I actually had to stop and rest for a few moments about two-thirds of the way through - I've never had that happen during any yoga session before!  There are no sun salutations or other ""warm up"" poses - the instructor jumps from head rolls straight to plank exercises, which may be part of why this was so exhausting.  I actually liked the faster pace, but for a yoga purist I imagine this might not be appealing.  The flexibility workout was a little less physically demanding, but it was still a decent workout, especially for a couch potato like me.",1387324800,,989,4.5852272727272725
5832220,4,B00DLX766Y,"I have to admit, I've only used this once so far, but I really like it.  I like the woman who runs/hosts the workout.  She seems very down to earth and seems to relate well to her viewers.  The strength building workout is challenging and after only one session, I can already feel my muscles a little bit sore.  Of course, I haven't done any workout in about 4 months, so my fitness level is a little pathetic.  It's good to have some experience with yoga before using this video -- it's not for a complete beginner, but it's pretty easy to follow along.  I'll update this review after using it for a few weeks, but looks like it's going to be a winner.",1386806400,,654,4.233870967741935
5832221,3,B00DLX766Y,"While the moves here seem ok, there is something lacking in the mood and tone of the video production.  For me, it seems to turn yoga into calisthenics, and is lacking the kind of inspiration of other yoga videos. From the style of diction and music, it could have been a DVD demonstrating a vacuum cleaner.

Additionally, it would be more useful if there were better indexing, and more details about the two programs (e.g. lengths, list of moves).  It is crying out for supplementary materials -- once I've done the routines, it would be nice to have a summary booklet that I could take with me while traveling, for example.",1386633600,,625,4.612612612612613

Yoga for Strength - 33 min
This has a fast tempo piano music that doesn't quite fit with the session. I felt some poses she repeated too many times back/forth like a pilates program instead of holding them longer. I understand the back/forth to add flexibility, but felt she did it too much here, such as planks to low push-ups, or raising on your toes & down in chair pose. It can also be physically demanding with holding planks, push-ups & side planks all at once. This class is better for those who work out at least a little semi-regularly or more often.
Yoga for Flexibility - 31 min
I enjoyed this music more, it had some piano, but had a good tempo for the movements & had more Enigma feel to it then jazzy. Here, she really focuses on opening up your shoulders, spine, pelvis & hips in a more relaxing way, but not boring, nor so easy you don't feel anything. Her program is unique (I have viewed over 100 yoga dvds at minimum), and I really felt the difference in my joints after, the muscles felt more stretched out/looser.
Meditation - 7 min
I didn't care for this short meditation, though others might. The music was fast tempo jazzy & she repeated herself too often, saying the same thing over again, many times not even changing the wording.

Overall, her style is a combination of the old, true style of yoga with saying the Sanskrit pose names, teaching Ujjayi breathing before each session, and a few spiritual ways of saying how to move your body, and words of encouragement to enjoy the moment and where you are. She also names muscles in their common Western way, and can be very descriptive on how to move your body, and where to feel the stretch, but also leave out some important information for those who are truly new to yoga. I'd say her style of teaching is 3/4 Western & 1/4 Eastern in .
This DVD is best for experienced beginners or more of yoga, and those who workout semi-regularly or more.

Collagevideo & Totalhealthdvds both have clips on their site, or you can also view them on Youtube.",1386201600,,2162,4.457070707070707
5832223,3,B00DLX766Y,"Let me start off with the fact I'm 64 yrs. old and have been doing yoga for the past 15 yrs.  I would consider myself at the intermediate level and have primarily practiced the Vinyasa, Hatha and yin styles of yoga.

I agree with other reviewers who said this is definitely not for the beginner just starting out with a yoga practice.  There was not much of a warm up to begin with or a cool down at the end in either the strength or flexibility routines.  Few modifications were given or basic alignment reminders for those not so familiar with basic yoga poses.  I did like the mediation segment, although would have liked it to be a bit longer and slower coming out of it.

Having said that, I found the routines challenging but for the most part did like them and felt I was getting a pretty good workout and if you're looking for a 30 minute, faster paced workout with some yoga incorporated, each of the segments on strength and flexibility provides that.  If you truly want a more yoga based practice with full instruction and modification for different levels of ability, there are better yoga DVDs that will provide that as well.",1386115200,2,1138,4.495145631067961
5832224,3,B00DLX766Y,"Background: Regular yoga practitioner for several years. I always seem to fall back to my favorite, Ashtanga, but like to try DVDs and local classes for some occasional variation.

Pros:
Pretty girl with a pleasing background
Good length for a quick ""Flexibility"" or ""Strength"" workout, or for a longer combined workout. (30 and 30 minutes)
Gives good modifications for postures
Good pace
Nice guided meditation

Cons:
Sorry, but her tone of voice is too upbeat for me. I like a relaxing/calm voice to guide me through my practice.
""Strength"" section is more of a floor routine.
Warm-up doesn't seem adequate to me.
Background music... too loud/annoying

Finding yoga videos you like is a very personal thing. David Swenson has my favorites for a long, 90 minutes session, and his short forms DVD for 15, 30, and 45 minute sessions (Ashtanga).

This is not a bad DVD, just not to my taste.",1385856000,,889,4.867549668874172
5832225,3,B00DLX766Y,"Element Yoga for Strength & Flexibility with Ashley Turner offers 2 30-minute practices, one for strength and the other for flexibility, as the title suggests.  There is a bonus meditation practice as well.  Turner is a good yoga instructor, offering clear and specific suggestions.  This DVD, however, is not for beginners.  No yoga modification tools are used.  You will need a yoga mat, obviously.

The flexibility practice is simple, mainly staying on the mat and not demanding too much by way of strength or balance.  Modifications are suggested but I did not find them necessary, although they are appreciated.  The practice uses easy dynamic movement to lead into deep stretches, starting with some standing poses before moving onto the mat.  The transitions are smooth and logical, and it is easy to immerse ones self in the practice, moving with the breath, which is what a yoga practice should be.

The strength practice is too difficult for me and I doubt many will find it easy.  Moving from Crescent Pose into Warrior III.  This is followed by a deep chair pose which is held for a long time.  Its definitely not easy.  No doubt, this will build strength but how many people can do these things with ease?  Perhaps a few people who have been practicing yoga a long time but I have my doubts.

The bonus meditation practice is a brief 10 minutes, not as long as I would like. It is a mindfulness meditation, focusing on the breath.  I found the background music to be a distraction and am disappointed that the DVD doesnt offer the option to turn the music off altogether.  However, I can see where this would be a lovely introduction to a meditation practice for those who are not already meditating on a regular basis.

All in all, I like this DVD although I don't think I will ever be able to work through the strength practice without significant modification.  I am sure Ill enjoy doing the flexibility practice occasionally but I would imagine that Ill pass this DVD along to someone stronger, with better balance, and maybe more experience with yoga than I.

To the DVD distribution company, however, I have one very clear complaint.  I see no point in added a cardboard sleeve to the DVD case when the content on the sleeve duplicates what is on the case.  Less packaging, in this day and age, is not something to be taken lightly.  While I would not think twice to buy a DVD with this instructor, I would think twice before buying a DVD from your company for this reason.",1385856000,,2492,4.649885583524028
5832226,4,B00DLX766Y,"Three tracks: one for ""strength"" (half hour), one for ""flexibility"" (half hour) and one for ""meditation"" (eight and a half minutes).

The instruction is soothing.  The meditation is simple and basic, it should be easy for everyone to enjoy and benefit from (and then easily do on your own without guidance).

The strength and flexibility tracks are good, but expect your first run through to be a bit confused.  It's difficult to watch a screen and perform the positions at the same time.  At first the workouts will probably be more than you can handle so just use them as an introduction and gradually increase your strength and skill.

Don't expect any detailed, technical explanations, these are straightforward guided routines.",1385856000,,732,5.058333333333334
5832227,3,B00DLX766Y,"In the past year, yoga has become a favorite way to work out for me, and I am always looking to become more flexible and strong. This sounded like the perfect DVD for the way that I like my yoga. While the routines themselves aren't necessarily bad, I've experienced so many more yoga DVDs that are taught better and flow smoother.

As you will find when you pull up the extremely basic menu, there are three segments to this DVD: yoga for strength, yoga for flexibility, and meditation. The two yoga workouts are about 30 minutes each, and the meditation is about 7 minutes. They are all done with the same background; a seemingly garden-like area with a pool nearby and the ocean off into the distance, a relaxing albeit strange setting (I'd never expect to see a pool in a workout video).

The workouts are definitely NOT for the beginner and are more toward the intermediate yoga student. The moves are sometimes tricky, and the instructor does not verbally explain them well at all. In fact, her cuing isn't that clear or in sync either. Often she doesn't call yoga moves by their actual name, and she'll say something completely ambiguous such as, ""Pull your inner thigh to your outer thigh,"" and I have to look at the screen to see what she's talking about. More often than not, when I do look at the TV, she's already coming out of the pose that she's just now telling you to get into; this lack of synch is really inexcusable considering that this DVD uses a voiceover format of teaching! Also, she never tells you which leg she's talking about; she instead just says ""your leg"" instead of specifying right or left. Obviously, with more repetition, I'll predict how to stay in time with her and how she wants me to do the poses, but my first few views leave me very confused.

Another reason that the workouts aren't very beginner is because they move very quickly. You will NEVER see a child's pose on the DVD, because she very rarely slows down or breaks, which I think you should always do in yoga, even if the focus is on strengthening.

Other reviewers have done a great job describing the segments, but I'll throw my two cents in. I do agree with several reviewers that complained about there being no warm up/sun salutations. It was very unnatural for my body to go straight into full on poses without first gradually waking up my muscles.

YOGA FOR STRENGTH - I did feel like this routine did a sufficient job of challenging my entire body. She begins by breathing with you for a few moments then doing some neck rolls. Then she moved on to poses which included the following: planks, side planks, crunches, bicycles, tricep pushups, crescent lunges, warrior III, split stretch, deep chair, warrior II, side angle, boat, bridge, and corpse. She ended the practice like I've never seen before: by emitting a very loud, jolting ""ohm"" hum. I thought it was odd to end the practice this way.

YOGA FOR FLEXIBILITY - Although there were a few good stretches, I honestly didn't feel like this did that great of a job in helping me attain a greater flexibility. Again she starts by breathing and doing some neck circles before moving into arm circles and standing side and back bends. She then emitted the weird ohm hum again and went into some moves that included the following: wide squats (very reminiscent of second position plies from ballet), standing cat/cow, hip circles, hamstring stretch, triangle pose, inner thigh stretch, half straddle stretch, and corpse pose.

It should be noted that during each corpse pose, the instructor attempts a motivational talk about being yourself in the moment. Unfortunately, it felt less genuine and more Hollywood/cheesy.

MEDITATION - I thought the meditation segment was excellent. I've attended several live meditations very much like this one. She instructs you how to sit cross legged and tall. She all tells you exactly how to breathe and hold your hands. It's a very relaxing few minutes that I honestly wish could have lasted a bit longer.

Overall, it's not a HORRIBLE yoga DVD; the teaching and cuing are just a bit sub-par, and I've seen many better yoga DVDs on the market. Crunch - Candlelight Yoga is an excellent relaxation/flexibility option; Crunch: Yoga Body Sculpt is a wonderful lower body strengthening workout; and 10 Minute Solution Yoga is great for total body sculpting, flexibility, and relaxation. I would definitely NOT recommend this DVD to beginners, and I would recommend that intermediates and advanced only try this DVD if they can't find anything else that works for them. While it does give a decent workout, it doesn't seem to capture the true essence of yoga and isn't very well produced at all.",1385769600,2,4688,4.742331288343558
5832228,3,B00DLX766Y,"These two yoga programs (Strength & Flexibility) really didn't do it for me. I think that they are probably good for what they are, but not quite what I prefer. I'm unaccustomed to yoga videos with voiceover like this, where the instructor is silently going through the sequences and apparently talking through them later in a sound studio. It felt impersonal and sort of bizarre.

The exercises themselves were okay, and somewhat challenging at times, but not all that appealing to me. I'm passionate about Kundalini yoga, and I'm much more satisfied following Sarah Kline's videos on YogaToday. This video may be most suitable for fans of other types of yoga, or perhaps Pilates.",1385510400,,681,4.973684210526316
5832229,3,B00DLX766Y,"As others have said, this is more of an intermediate level dvd set.  Beginners will probably find this a little too strenuous.  I don't do yoga frequently enough to consider myself 'intermediate'. A nice set however if you are a regular practitioner.",1385424000,,250,4.928571428571429
5832230,5,B00DLX766Y,"I am new to Yoga and some of Ashley Turner's practices are a little beyond my ability and scope.  I also have some health issues that warrant Yoga but also make some of it more difficult (Multiple Sclerosis and Fibromyalgia).  Ashley presents some options for various poses that provide a lighter and less stressful pose for muscles that might be tight or in spasm.  All of it should be taken with a grain of salt and worked at with one's own comfort level.

I enjoyed Ashley's voice, tone and pace.  Following along was very doable even if working on some of the poses and exercises is a bit beyond my reach right now.  I have hopes that in time, I will be able to do some of these poses.  The music was soothing, the setting for the DVD is gorgeous and a great vacation away from the soon to be Winter doldrums of Upstate New York.  I enjoyed the meditation as much as I did the two programs.  I see great potential for this Yoga program and I look forward to using it often and gaining some flexibility and strength.

In my opinion, this DVD is done very well and seems geared towards the beginner to intermediate Yogi.  A healthy beginner could take these exercises on but I think that like any program, talk to your doctor and don't push it.",1385424000,,1246,4.35064935064935
5832231,4,B00DLX766Y,"I figured since I just tried Pilates for the first time and really liked it, I'd give Yoga a try. I liked the dvd a lot and I plan to alternate between this and my Pilates dvd. I did prefer the flexibilty section more than the strength and really enjoyed the meditation afterwards. Backdrop is serene and the music is very calming which I liked. Modifications for the poses were a big plus and Ashley was easy to follow along with. I can't wait to see how better my body feels after a couple months of practice.",1384992000,,511,4.278350515463917
5832232,5,B00DLX766Y,"This is a good dvd to add to my exercise library.  It's a very calming yoga routine, but by no means easy.  There are three separate routines, one for strength, one for flexibility, and a guided meditation.  You can do just one or all in a work out, depending on what you want.

These workouts are easy enough to follow that a beginner could do most of it, yet they're challenging enough for an experienced yoga practicer.  I like how she gives options to make it harder, but still tells us how to do the poses the basic way.  The poses will definitely increase both strength and flexibility.

One of my favorite parts is the guided meditation.  I want to and need to meditate regularly, and this guided relaxation will help me get into the routine.",1384905600,,749,4.455882352941177

This DVD has been helpful in achieving those goals. The pace and type of moves taught are at the right level for beginners. I'm able to keep up, but still feel like I'm increasing my flexibility and improving my muscle tone. The meditation section was a little short compared to the first two parts, but other than that, I'm happy with this program and it has given me the confidence to take a yoga class and not worry about feeling like I have no idea what I'm doing.",1384646400,,620,4.4

Both classes are over thirty minutes long and both are a good workout! There is also a bonus guided meditation - under ten minutes - included that I liked as well.

The background is beautiful, a garden overlooking the ocean and the classes good. The only thing that was a bit difficult for me was the teachers narration. It was a bit mumbled and hard to understand, especially the first time I did the classes. It got easier after that. I also liked that there are modifications shown, if you are not up to the full poses. I found this to be two good classes on one DVD.",1384300800,2,772,4.475177304964539
5832235,4,B00DLX766Y,"I was frankly a bit worried about adding this CD to my work out regime. I have been practicing yoga for almost 15 years and love the practice but not so much the ""be one with your leg"" blather I have run across from time to time. I was unfamiliar with Ashley Turner and the California blonde psychologist bit just about put me off. I am really glad it did not. This CD includes two really solid programs:

Ms. Turner is a bit more mature than she appears on the CD cover and not quite as eye-crossingly perfect either. She is a lovely woman but more accessible in CD-Person. She has a melodic voice and she uses it to effectively guide you through both practices. (She does advise the viewer to dedicate their practice and uses the standard yoga-speak but it does not disrupt the flow.)  I typically work out very early (5-5:30 am) and don't bother with lenses at that hour. I was easily able to follow along with both programs largely using Ms. Turners verbal instructions. I did watch through most of the Strength practice prior to attempting this, mainly to evaluate the quality of the production and Ms. Turner's technique. (Both are quite good.)

Strength Practice - Ms. Turner takes you through the standard poses (Warrior 2 & 3, down dog, up dog, chair, standing split, plank and so on.) I like that she uses the ""strength in stillness"" concept in many of the poses.* There is little to no advise here on basic yoga forms and anyone new to the practice would be well advised to start with a different CD, this is intermediate work.

Flexibility Practice - This program really works the kinks created by the Strength Practice out of your body. It is a solid stretch. I did enjoy some of the quirkier stretches, I just might have done a slow motion twerk  for the first time in my life! Again, this is really not a place for a beginner to start but not as difficult as the first program for sure.

Meditation - This is a relatively short little meditation that is a nice add on to either programs or for one of those ""chill"" days we all have from time to time.

All in all I am very impressed with this CD and plan to add it to my yoga/pilates rotation.

The two 30-minute workouts are filmed in a lovely outdoor setting.  The instructor is likable with a pleasing voice.  I liked that she offered modifications for many of the poses.  However the music is distracting, monotonous, and downright annoying.  Think electronic elevator music.  It's also too loud and almost drowns out the instructor.",1384214400,,558,5.111111111111111
5832238,3,B00DLX766Y,"I taught yoga for a few years while I was in college, and therefore I'm really picky about the yoga videos I incorporate into my own practice.  Ashley Turner has a very nice voice for yoga instruction; her voice is middle-pitched and easy on the ears, though at some points (particularly during the breathing exercises) I felt like she was talking too much.

When it comes down to the yoga, however, I found myself wondering what kind of yoga she's teaching.  Some of the sequences felt more like aerobics modified to fit yoga, and I'm personally not a fan of that.  It definitely warms your body up, which is a good thing for helping prevent injury during deeper poses, but they just felt awkward and out of place in a yoga practice to me.

If you're a yoga beginner, I wouldn't recommend starting out with this DVD.  I've fallen off the wagon for a couple of months and started back out doing this, and I ended up with seriously shaky legs during the strength practice.  Turner offers great suggestions for modifying the poses if you find them difficult, but I would recommend going to a studio first until you're comfortable with yoga practice in general.  Then, you can add this to your home practice if you want some extra yoga time.",1383955200,12,1238,4.570135746606335
5832239,4,B00DLX766Y,"This was my introduction to doing Yoga, and my motivation was mainly stretching and increased flexibility.  I appreciated the thorough and clear instructions throughout the exercises.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to follow along and properly do (to some extent) the positions.  Most of the positions have a range of stretches, so as a beginner, I could experience the work and see a goal to shoot for in the future.

What I noticed is that both programs help with stretching and strengthening, even though each focuses on one more than the other.  My muscles were sore after doing them...I felt like I had lifted weights but also felt loose.  I am eager to continue using this dvd.

I was not interested in any of the guided meditational work--either the separate video or during the other two.  I found that part of the program a bit corny and ignored them and just did the physical work and breathing exercises.",1383523200,,928,4.720496894409938
5832240,5,B00DLX766Y,"Having prior purchased a Yoga lesson by Ashley Turner, I was prepared to sweat.  I was not disappointed.  As before in the prior lesson, though the routine for the Strength portion was tough, it was doable. She also provides some modifications, if sections are too difficult. I have had some other instructor's routines, to not be doable for beginner to intermediates.  This is not the case here.

This was one heck of a core/leg workout.  Your lunges and warrior poses will be all that much stronger for it.

The flexibility routine, though not a cinch also was doable.  You will sweat here too.  The first part is predominantly upper body (shoulders/chest) and the latter concentrates on lower body (hips and hamstrings).  While I'm sure beginners (like me) and intermediates may not be able to go as deep in poses as the instructor, there is much room where they can do all the poses.

There was a meditation section about 8 minutes long, that while good suffered from the inclusion of too noisy music. It missed the point of the meditation.  In fact I think the whole DVD, could do without the music.

If you watch this DVD on a laptop like I do, there is no way to turn down the music separate from the voice.  I know I looked.

Her instruction is very good, you don't always have to watch what she is doing to understand what is next. I also like that she looks like an athlete and not a twig.",1383436800,,1399,4.478260869565218
