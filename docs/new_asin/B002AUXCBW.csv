8360427,3,B002AUXCBW,I purchased all three seasons of this show for my daughter who is a fan.  Each season is a three disk set but what I didn't know is each season only includes six shows totaling only two and a half hours of programming!!  No need to waste money on expensive packaging when you could put them all on one disk.  But then they couldn't charge the high price they do.  Good quality video but not enough value for the price!  Not enough cake for me!!,1255305600,7,444,4.176470588235294
