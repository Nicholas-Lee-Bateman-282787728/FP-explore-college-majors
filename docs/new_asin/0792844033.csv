155311,4,0792844033,"Memphis is the setting, and the specter of Elvis pervades a trio of stories in ""Mystery Train,"" written and directed by Jim Jarmusch.  The three episodes that make up the movie are told separately and in their entirety, though they happen simultaneously in time, and share nothing more than a common local which serves as the hub around which the stories revolve.  And with them, Jarmusch does what he does best:  he invites the audience in to share some time with the individuals who populate his landscape, as he places them under the microscope to study the minutiae of their lives.  In his hands, the details of everyday existence become fresh and new, like the first time you see a new city or make the acquaintance of a total stranger who forever after becomes a part of your life.  It's an intimate style of filmmaking, almost voyeuristic, wherein the camera becomes the eyes of the audience and makes the viewer more than a mere onlooker; it places you in the scene, which allows you to experience what the characters are experiencing, to live what they are living.  When someone is walking down the street, you're on that street with them, feeling the pavement beneath your feet; in the train depot, you drink in the atmosphere, feeling the texture of the walls, of the aged wood of the benches, smelling the age-old scents of time that hang on the air.  You're there with the young couple from Japan, in Memphis to see Sun Studios and Graceland; and with the young widow from Rome, passing through with the casket of her late husband awaiting transport at the airport; and with three young men who have too much to drink and within a few hours find out how quickly life can become so complicated.  Jarmusch works with such precision that it makes everything that happens seem spontaneous; it's an innate sense of knowing what works, and how to make that necessary connection with the audience by making all that transpires real.  He's a skilled craftsman who knows what he wants and exactly how to deliver it.  He creates the proper atmosphere, then introduces you to the characters through which his story will be told.  And once the stage is set, Jarmusch knows that ""who"" these people are and what makes them unique is as important as the story itself, for in a sense, the characters ""are"" the story.  It's an examination of human nature; of traits and of how people function under certain circumstances.  And through each character the viewer gets a different perspective on what is happening, along with some insight into how we all relate to one another in a given situation, from the mundane to the bizarre.  To tell his tale, Jarmusch has assembled a talented, eclectic cast of actors, including Masatoshi Nagase (Jun) and the charismatic Youki Kudoh (Mitsuko), the couple from Japan with opposing perspectives of Memphis; Nicoletta Braschi (Luisa), the widow awaiting a flight back to Rome; Elizabeth Bracco (Dee Dee), a young woman whose life is in transition; Tom Noonan (Man in Diner), a man with a menacing presence and a strange tale to tell; Steve Buscemi (Charlie), a regular guy led astray by trusting indifference, along with Rick Aviles (Will Robinson) and Lowell Roberts (Lester); Stephen Jones, a dead-ringer for Elvis who is extremely effective here as his ghost; and the two whose characters are pivotal to the story, Screamin' Jay Hawkins (Hotel Night Clerk), and Cinque Lee (The Bellboy).  And--heard, but not seen-- Tom Waits (Voice of the Radio DJ).  Thoroughly engrossing and highly entertaining, ""Mystery Train"" is vintage Jarmusch; a director whose minimalist techniques and style make for a satisfying and rewarding movie-going experience.  He will not dazzle you with ILM F/X or feed you endless lines of witty dialogue; instead, he gives you more:  A film that is artistically and cleverly rendered, with an engaging story and characters that are ""real.""  An independent filmmaker who stays true to his personal ""vision,"" Jarmusch gives you that which is rarely found in Hollywood.  A film that is truly original.",976147200,6,4056,4.8934306569343065
155312,5,0792844033,"This movie is awesome!  It, at times, can be so off-base and bizarre, that it is just hysterical. (E.G., ""I wouldn't eat that if I were  you."")  Outside of the (clueless) Japanese couple, my favorite actor  awards would have to go to Screamin' Jay Hawkins as the hotel manager and  Joe Strummer (ex-Clash).  They are incredible!

It's a neat effect, the way the trilogy connects the stories. I got it the first time I  watched it.
In the first story you hear something seemingly out of place  and you wonder why it ends without any further explanation. When you hear  it in the second story you realize that's what's going to connect the  trilogy. And of course through the whole third story you're expecting it to  happen any minute.

155316,4,0792844033,"I recently got this DVD and was dismayed to find that the English subtitles were missing (as the last reviewer pointed out.) I just found a fix that may work for some people. The ""Subtitles"" screen lists only French and Spanish as choices. But the remote for my Toshiba 3109  player has a ""Subtitles"" button that can be used while the movie  is playing. With ""Mystery Train"" this button brings up four  choices: ""1 Fre"", ""2 Spa"", ""3 Fre"" and  ""4 Spa"". The first two will bring up French or Spanish subtitles  as expected. But choosing either ""3 Fre"" or ""4 Spa""  will cause English subtitles to appear for the Japanese portions of the  film!

True to form, Buscemi gets a raw deal, but not as severe as the Coen brothers mete out (one comes to dread his character's death in almost every film, right?).

The story follows three different stories, all connected by the thread that the characters in each spend the night in the same hotel. The acting is fantastic, as most of the cast is unknown to American audiences. A young Steve Buscemi shines as usual, showing why he would become a major character actor.

155364,5,0792844033,"A delightful trudge through Memphis with a couple of jaded Japanese tourists.  The fact that they speak practically no English just adds to the charm and surrealism.  It's actually a collage of three or four more or less independent stories, a form that I am particularly partial to, sort of like waking up from a dream into another dream several times.

This is one of those movies I saw ""cold,"" having no idea what it was about.  It turns out that that's the only way to see a movie.  It is said that Gene Siskel would never read about or discuss a movie before seeing it, wanting to absorb its full impact (or lack thereof) completely free of prejudice.  The only problem is that we civilians can't afford to see every movie and we need to perform a modicum of triage to avoid wasting our limited resources on the clinkers.

Seeing Mystery Train ""cold"" was an experience I won't forget, though I've watched it many times since.",1403308800,2,930,4.532934131736527

I know for continuity that some artistic license is necessary, but it was odd to me that they got off the train and a bit later were walking past Sun studio and were then down on south main.  Sun studio is quite a walk from south main.  If you're ever in Memphis, visit the south main area, there are several galleries and they have trolley night the last friday of every month.  Take Beale toward the river and turn left at Main, it's a short walk.  Pearl's oyster bar is a must see as well, you'll be going right by it.",1391990400,,664,4.15625

I was so happy to see it was out on Blu-ray that I had to update my collection with it. I mean with a cast including... Joe Strummer, Tom Waits, Steve Buscemi, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Rick Aviles, Cinqu Lee (brother of Spike), Elizabeth Bracco, Nicoletta Brachi (often seen in her husband Roberto Benigni's movies and along with him in another Jarmusch flick, Down By Law just 3 years earlier also with Waits), and others, it gets an interesting jump start before the first scene (which is pretty quirky-funny from that point on).

155373,5,0792844033,"Mystery Train is probably one of Jarmusch's least well known films, but I would estimate that it is his most influential, primarily for its apparent influence on Tarantino.  The movie is really three loosely interconnected substories, that run roughly parallel in time and can be related to one another through two audial landmarks: a gunshot and the Elvis song Blue Moon.  Actually, the first of the three stories is the weakest, in my opinion, and as a result, I found the beginning rather slow, a complaint that was more than made up for by the second two substories.  The innovative, nonlinear story line is one of the neatest aspects of the film, and I'll wager that this was the inspiration for the similar device in Pulp Fiction.

Besides this, Mystery Train is full of quirky, humorous characters who give entertaining, Tarantinoesque soliquies.  The mood-setting soundtrack also harkens back to Tarantino's better films, probably also the inspiration for them.  There is a strain of Elvis mysticism that runs through the film, with hints of numerology--how much would Elvis have weighed on Jupiter at the time of his death?  Also, the number ""22"" is repeated again and again in different contexts--the age of Buddy Holly's death is the only association I can make.  The homoerotic fixation of Christian Slater for Elvis must derive from this source as well, although it is oddly out of place in True Romance.

This is a delightful find for any fan of Jarmusch or Tarantino.  Highly recommended.",1363219200,,1503,4.976

I personally like this film alot, it's set in Memphis Tennessee, and has alot of Elvis Nostalgia in it. The film has three stories that are all different than the other, but all weave and interconnect to each other in the film as it goes on. It is a slow paced movie, with a little humor and a little darkness and also a little tired feeling. If your a fan of Jim's work than I would say you would like this film alot.

I watched the movie with my thumb on the fast forward button. Some of the silence and pauses were effective, but after awhile they become annoying. A little editing wouldn't hurt the overall pacing.

The hook of this film - or at least what got me - was the tie-in to Elvis. Actually, Elvis and Memphis could have been any celebrity and any city. Point being, if you're an Elvis fan, don't watch this film for Elvis. With that said, those who know the Memphis area and/or the Sun Studio history, will appreciate the locales, as well as references to Sun artists (as a Carl Perkins fan I have to give props to Jarmusch for mentioning Carl during the movie, as well as admitting in the Q & A feature to being a Perkins fan). Rufus Thomas has a much too short appearance. Though not a Sun artist, Screamin' Jay Hawkins is fun to watch.

Having not been familiar with Jarmusch's style, I didn't know what to expect from this film. While I found the film somewhat appealing, I couldn't take the slow pacing.",1339200000,2,1173,4.47196261682243

I particularly like very original movies with amazing photography. This has some of the best photography I have seen in a movie.  It's just beautiful and artsy.

It's far out, different, funny and exhilarating.  Japanese Elvis freaks touring Memphis,
complete with eerie night photography of neon Memphis, the lonliness, the mystery of it,
shadowy, off kilter, spooky, things are not what they seem, but hauntingly beautiful.
Gave me some delicious goosebumps.  Sex in the night in a fleabag motel, the very idea of Japanese imitating Elvis, getting so into it, wandering around soaking up the atmosphere,
like aliens from another planet trying to fit in.  The clash of cultures so subtle here,
ups the intensity, the strangeness.

The idea of three interconnected stories interested me until I realized only at the end of the film that the stories of course were not interconnected at all.  Although not director Jarmusch's fault, he could have really improved the film by incorporating a few techniques from Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", with its brilliant use of interconnected characters and non-chronological story telling.

155392,4,0792844033,"Released in 1989, MYSTERY TRAIN was Jim Jarmusch's third film. The film consists of three independent but interlocking vignettes which take place in a Memphis hotel run by Screamin' Jay Hawkins with the help of bellboy Cinque Lee.

In the first scene, young Japanese tourists Mitsuko (Youki Kudoh) and Jun (Matsatoshi Nagase) pass through Memphis to see the monuments of 1950s rock 'n' roll. Their relationship isn't going so well, evoking tragedy. The second vignette introduces us to a recently widowed Italian woman (Nicoletta Braschi) who has to spend a night in town before she can depart with her husband's coffin. Finally, the third vignette follows the post-layoff bender of a couple of newly unemployed locals (Joe Strummer, Rick Aviles) and a local barber (Steve Buscemi). In spite of armed robbery and murder, this is actually the most straight-up funny portion of the film. It's a typical Buscemi part of a nice guy caught up in scandalous events beyond his control, and Joe Strummer has a gift for comedic acting. Between these three plotlines, we are treated to great deadpan interludes between Hawkins and the bellboy.

Some filmmakers evoke the natural beauty of their country. Who doesn't want to visit the windswept coasts of Bergman's Sweden or the feverish urban nights of the Italian auteurs? Jarmusch's first three films, on the other hand, portray the United States as a blight of weeds, empty streets, grafitti and failing infrastructure. American by birth, I left the US years ago and this film only makes me grateful I did. But even if the landscape is hideous, with its fairly harmonious relationship of characters of different races, MYSTERY TRAIN does depict a beautiful society that I hope is out there somewhere.

I wouldn't rank MYSTERY TRAIN as highly as certain other Jarmusch films. The three stories here are clearly independently conceived, and though they are reconciled into a single plot, the film as a whole doesn't seem so epic.

155393,4,0792844033,"Released in 1989, MYSTERY TRAIN was Jim Jarmusch's third film. The film consists of three independent but interlocking vignettes which take place in a Memphis hotel run by Screamin' Jay Hawkins with the help of bellboy Cinque Lee.

In the first scene, young Japanese tourists Mitsuko (Youki Kudoh) and Jun (Matsatoshi Nagase) pass through Memphis to see the monuments of 1950s rock 'n' roll. Their relationship isn't going so well, evoking tragedy. The second vignette introduces us to a recently widowed Italian woman (Nicoletta Braschi) who has to spend a night in town before she can depart with her husband's coffin. Finally, the third vignette follows the post-layoff bender of a couple of newly unemployed locals (Joe Strummer, Rick Aviles) and a local barber (Steve Buscemi). In spite of armed robbery and murder, this is actually the most straight-up funny portion of the film. It's a typical Buscemi part of a nice guy caught up in scandalous events beyond his control, and Joe Strummer has a gift for comedic acting. Between these three plotlines, we are treated to great deadpan interludes between Hawkins and the bellboy.

Some filmmakers evoke the natural beauty of their country. Who doesn't want to visit the windswept coasts of Bergman's Sweden or the feverish urban nights of the Italian auteurs? Jarmusch's first three films, on the other hand, portray the United States as a blight of weeds, empty streets, grafitti and failing infrastructure. American by birth, I left the US years ago and this film only makes me grateful I did. But even if the landscape is hideous, with its fairly harmonious relationship of characters of different races, MYSTERY TRAIN does depict a beautiful society that I hope is out there somewhere.

I wouldn't rank MYSTERY TRAIN as highly as certain other Jarmusch films. The three stories here are clearly independently conceived, and though they are reconciled into a single plot, the film as a whole doesn't seem so epic. The middle vignette is rather lightweight, although Tom Noonan's bit as a scam artist is creepy and memorable. Still, the film is entertaining and fairly well put-together, and the visuals provide a new strong aspect that one doesn't find in the two earlier efforts.

155396,5,0792844033,"In MYSTERY TRAIN (1989), writer/director Jim Jarmusch ties three separate stories together using a run-down Memphis motel and an Elvis song on the radio (his SUN Records slow ballad, ""Blue Moon""). Night manager of the hostel where everything converges is Screamin' Jay Hawkins, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Put-a-Spell-on-You/dp/B003CLT2RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""I Put a Spell on You""</a>&nbsp;fame. This song was integral to an earlier Jarmusch feature (and short) called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STRANGER-THAN-PARADISE/dp/0792846664/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STRANGER THAN PARADISE</a>&nbsp;(1984). (Hawkins BTW does a fine job here.)

First of the trio is two youngsters from Japan who make a Memphis pilgramage to visit the home and environs of Elvis Presley. The seedy part of town where they bed down for the night may in hindsight come as a culture shock, but these two are so ""into"" the experience of the moment, they only spend a brief time discussing the contrast to Yokohama. Her devotion to the King and his contrary preference for Carl Perkins, plus her sweet nature and his dour one would seemingly be incompatible, yet they're very much in love with each other and this American adventure. The sound of a pistol shot is the only actual link to the other stories.

Next is an Italian widow who's just passing through on her way to Rome; her husband's casketed body awaits at the airport. She meets a chatty NJ gal who's just left her boyfriend and has nowhere to go. They spend the night at Screamin' Jay's motel, where in the small hours the ghost of Elvis appears to the widow. The two also hear that gunshot.

The final segment is darkest yet most comic of all. The jilted boyfriend of the previous vignette robs a liquor store and accidentally shoots a clerk. He and two buddies tie one on, then seek refuge at the workplace of one of their cousins, yes, the same motel. The bellhop cousin gives them a wrecked room. Later, one is shot in the leg, which leads to a car chase finale where  principals of the earlier segments pass by on a train.

For those unfamiliar with his work, Jim Jarmusch's pacing and sense of place and detail can be daunting. MYSTERY TRAIN offers a most approachable way to experience his unique cinematic style. Highly recommended!

155397,3,0792844033,"""Mystery Train,"" the third film directed by Jim Jarmusch, is a trilogy of stories set in the train station waiting rooms, dingy diners, pool halls, motel rooms, and cheap liquor stores of Memphis.  In ""Far From Yokohama,"" two Japanese tourists arrive in Memphis by train determined to find the King of Rock `n' Roll.  In ""A Ghost,"" an Italian widow awaits transit arrangements for her husband's coffin.  And in ""Lost in Space,"" a depressed Englishman, who has been dumped by his longtime girlfriend and laid off from his job,  drowns his sorrow in drink and then goes on the run with his luckless would-be brother-in-law and a work colleague.

Jarmusch often manages to make Memphis look like a ghost town, focusing not on the city's history or its status as the music capital of the United States but on its darker, sadder aspects, complete with characters that life seems to have passed by or at least not given a fair shake.  Jarmusch's pace is slow and that's OK at first, since he gives us interesting characters to figure out and interesting locations to entertain the eye, but ultimately ""Mystery Train"" doesn't really hang together with the assorted characters and stories blending thematically.

Blu-ray bonus extras include an original documentary on the film's locations and rich social history of Memphis, a Q & A with Jarmusch in which he responds to questions sent in by fans, and a booklet featuring critical essays.",1278201600,4,1431,4.912863070539419

In the way of special features, there is a ""Q&A with Jim."" As he has done for past Criterion editions of his films, Jarmusch answers questions submitted by fans in lieu of an audio commentary. They are by no means restricted to the film but the bulk of them do pertain to it. Jarmusch confirms that Tom Waits' D.J. heard in the film is in fact the character he played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Down-by-Law-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005JKFX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Down by Law - Criterion Collection</a>. He talks about how he worked with the Japanese actors and the origins of their segment title. He also talks about his favourite Elvis era and addresses the barren and bleak look of Memphis in the film.

""I Put a Spell on Me"" features excerpts from a 2001 documentary on Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Jarmusch is interviewed and talks about when he first heard Jay's signature song, ""I Put a Spell on You,"" how he used it in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stranger-Than-Paradise-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000SFJ4HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stranger Than Paradise - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;and then cast him in Mystery Train.

""Memphis Tour"" revisits many of the locations used in the film. We get a brief history of each location and what happened to it since filming. The restaurant used is the oldest in the city. Unfortunately, the hotel featured so prominently in the film was torn down a year after it was made. This is a fascinating extra that takes a look at how these locales have changed over the years.

155416,4,0792844033,"I'm not much of a fan of Jim Jarmusch, but 1989's Mystery Train (his fourth film and first one in color) is quite engaging in they way it tells three minimalist stories occurring in what is presumably the seedier side of Memphis. An Elvis motif runs through all the episodes, which are set mostly in a rundown hotel during one night (Blues legend Screaming Jay Hawkins plays the clerk). In the first episode, a young Japanese couple arrives in the town which gave birth to rock and roll (she is quirky, he is impassive; she loves Elvis, he Carl Perkins). In the second episode, an Italian woman (Niccoleta Braschi) whose husband has just died has to spend a night in Memphis. She shares the room in the hotel with a talkative American woman (Elizabeth Bracco). During the night, she imagines or sees the ghost of Elvis. In the third episode, a British guy who is called Elvis by his lowlife friends, and who has just broken with the woman of the second episode (and is played by the late Clash guitarist Joe Strummer) more or less accidentally shots a liquor shop seller, and has to take refuge in the hotel, along with his brother in law (played by Steve Buscemi). A gunshot heard during the night sort of links the three episodes. Nothing much happens, but Jarmusch shows his love with American pop culture and his fine ear for the way the American working class talk everyday.",1201564800,,1379,4.587044534412955
155417,5,0792844033,"This movie, woven around two Japanese kids looking for Elvis more or less, in some nondescript Southern city - I don't know what to say.  The city itself is protrayed emotionally flat - kind of like what you'd see on a trip to your own drugstore.  But that makes it all the more intriguing.

There's several stories going on, woven around the quest for Elvis.

The places seemed too familiar - and I found myself wondering if I'd been to those place, met those people ... but I haven't - and won't - until I watch this flick again, which I will.

It's too much of a friendly place not to return.  Set off by hints of larceny, physical danger and sex, and where we find that we can take these people's quest for Elvis in stride.",1190419200,,727,4.2700729927007295
155418,5,0792844033,"Mystery Train follows three stories through the heat of dreary summertime Memphis. Two Japanese teens dressed to the nines in 80s couture explore Memphis on a quest to determine once and for all whether Elvis or Carl Perkins was the true king of American rock and roll. They are awkwardly out of place amongst the townsfolk, but even more out of place with each other. She constantly jokes and jokes with him, at one point smearing lipstick across his face, only to be continuously ignored as he stares coolly into the distance. Their depressing love making scene in the seedy hotel where all the characters end up underscores the distance between them.

An Italian woman has an unexpected layover in Memphis related to the seemingly sudden and unexplained death of her husband. She tries to quietly navigate her way through the town, but is faced with con artists at every turn. She ends up sharing a room in the seedy hotel with a chatty local girl on the run from her allegedly crazy boyfriend and, as the only character indifferent to American pop culture, ironically ends up being woken in the night by a vision of Elvis.

The local girl's boyfriend sullenly drinks himself belligerent at a local bar with two friends. After being kicked out for getting too rowdy, the three take off in a pickup truck and rob a liquor store, unexpectedly shooting the clerk. They hide out in the same seedy hotel. Steve Buscemi is, as usual, a fabulous loser everyman who gets the brunt of the punishment for all their half-witted schemes.

The highlight of the movie for me was the bold and hilarious Screamin' Jay Hawkins who mans the desk at the seedy hotel. He continuously torments his bellhop, making fun of his hat and tricking him out of the Japanese plum he receives as a tip from the Japanese tourists. ""You got any more Japanese plums? Or other exotic fruits from around the world?""

Overall, the movie is fun and watchable whether you want to read meaning into the connections between the storylines or not. It's an elegant collage of cultural clichs and a humorous look at the pursuit of superficial dreams.",1157328000,,2109,4.7228260869565215

It takes place during a single night in Memphis, and revolves around three unconnected storylines: a Japanese couple on a ""pilgrimage"" to Elvis shrines, an Italian woman whose flight back to Rome has been delayed, and a trio of young sleazes who get drunk and shoot a liquor store owner. They all spend the night at a fleabag hotel (The Arcade, run by Screamin' Jay Hawkins!). Jarmusch's use of flashback, a la RASHOMON, is clever and inspired. But Jarmush also likes to use long takes of scenes in which virtually nothing happens, which can make the movie feel long and ponderous.

The stories are so orginal and flat out hilarious, all three taking place in Memphis, Tennesee and involving Elvis Presley in some way. The best story is the first, Far From Yokohama, involving the young Japanese couple (Masatoshi Nagasai & Yuki Kudoh) visiting Memphis for the first time. Though the other two stories, A Ghost and Lost In Space are also funny. Music legend Screamin' Jay Hawkins is terrific as the night manager of a run down hotel.

155421,4,0792844033,"The roads to a town usually bring people home or people away from home.  The road in Mystery Train is a railroad where the Amtrak delivers people through a city where some get off.  People arriving to the town come there for different reasons and they leave for different reasons.  Mystery Train is a study of people in the same place at the same time.

Memphis, Tennessee, is the destination for a young Japanese couple that arrives to see Graceland and other tourist attractions of the 1950s American music.  Disoriented and detached from the American society, Jun (Masatoshi Nagase) and Mitsuko (Youki Kudoh) experience a drastic culture clash, as they compare their home Yokohama with Memphis.  The space between them and Memphis continues to grow, as they speak broken English muddled by their Japanese accents.  Nonetheless, Jun and Mitsuko find a dirty and shabby hotel where they decide to spend the night.

Stuck for a night in Memphis the audience gets to follow the Italian woman Luisa (Nicoletta Braschi) who attempts to find a way to pass time while wandering around in the town.  People try to take advantage of her innocence while preying on her kindness and the dollar bills in her purse.  In order to escape a possible dangerous situation she arrives in the same shabby hotel where the young Japanese couple is spending the night.

The third story that the audience gets to follow is about Johnny (Joe Strummer) who recently has lost his job and his wife.  In drunkenness Johnny escapes the reality of Memphis, as the pain that he suffers is all too real while hiding a gun tucked away in his belt.  An acquaintance calls his friend Will (Rick Aviles) who calls his brother-in-law Charlie (Steve Buscemi), as they are worried about him being drunk and having a gun.  Johnny brings his two friends on a hazardous journey with the gun, which ends at the shabby hotel where the foreigners are spending their night.

Mystery Train provides an insightful and thoughtful venture for the audience while three different stories converge in the same hotel.  Some are arriving to Memphis as others are trying to leave while some are stuck there without the notion of leaving.  The different characters are all unique.  Their uniqueness brings them all different experiences despite being at the same location at the same time.  Jim Jarmusch provides an outmost clever depiction of the convergence of people in time and place, which of course provides an unique experience to all the people involved due to their own uniqueness.  This trivial notion turns into an existential philosophical debate through Jarmusch's eye, which offers something for all to contemplate.",1112572800,4,2673,4.95067264573991

So I got online and saw that other people could see it with English subtitles. I tried what C Kueny said back in like 2000 on this very review page, and it worked.  I had to push the subtitle button on the remote that came with the DVD player, and there were different French and Spanish options. I selected each of them, and sure enough, the third and fourth ones gave me English subtitles.

So now I need to watch this film again because I get the jist of what happened in the first part, but I don't understand it as well as I should.

I was so captivated by it, I went out and rented another VCR so I could dub the copy of it on to a VHS tape.  Perhaps that will shed some light on how good this movie is.  Perhaps.
I now have it on DVD and, since purchasing it, have watched it repeatedly.  This movie sucks you in and never lets you go from the very opening shot.  The cinematography, the dialogue, the direction...all are simply amazing.  The humor too...it's a level of humor that is never loud or brash or ""in your face.""  It's a witty sense of humor and it fits perfectly.
Another thing that bears mentioning is the cast.  The actors are amazing.  Screamin' Jay, Joe Strummer, et al.  All are just incredible.
Definitely check this movie out.  It has a very ""Night on Earth"" feel to it, if you've seen that movie.  Basically four different story-lines, all inter-woven and inter-related, that sort of all come together in the end.  Things happen from one point of you (i.e., the Japanese tourists hearing the gun shot while in the hotel room), then later you see what has happened from the other individual's point of view (i.e. the gun shot ""victim"").  Maybe that's done nothing but confused you, but take my word (for what it's worth) that it all comes together perfectly.
I'm certain you will enjoy this one.  Also, Tom Waits fans take note...you'll get to hear him in this flick.  As an aside, I mentioned ""Night on Earth""....if you like Tom Waits, get that movie as well.

As a ""foreigner"" in a strange, yet strangely familiar, country I  immediately connected with the three tales in MT. Of course, I didn't have the language obstacles the characters have in the film, but I could understand their awe and curiosity about every little thing. Besides that, I felt lucky to be exposed to Jarmusch's style and his filmic vision. I would also see DOWN BY LAW while I was there, and later, while back in the States, Jarmusch's first classic STRANGER THAN PARADISE.

7792511,5,0792844033,"A great film. Quintin Tarantino wishes he had the talent to make films like this. Stellar cast.
I still crack up thinking of the scene where Braschi's character wakes up in a strange bed and sees Elvis's ghost
materialize at the foot of her bed. Elvis is about as surprised as she is and promptly excuses himself.

Thank God there are people like Jarmusch out there who make great films otherwise we'd all have rotten brains
from watching all those rehashed remakes that Hollywood s*its out.",1490745600,,491,4.709302325581396

7792515,4,0792844033,"The film tells three stories, basically unconnected except that the characters all check into the same hotel in Memphis. The hotel is a flea trap with just the most minimal furniture in tiny rooms; at check-in  ""No TV.""

There are just the barest necessities: a bed, two chairs, a night table, a portrait of Elvis on the wall.

The director Jim Jarmusch takes his time with almost every shot, lingering on the minimalist scenes and in no hurry to move the story along. As Roger Ebert writes: ""Notice how some of his traveling shots in ""Mystery Train"" seem to dictate the movements of characters, rather than following them. See how he isolates a portion of an interior rather than ""establishing"" a whole location. Notice the unobtrusive manipulation of time when the drunks are riding around in a pickup.""

Each of the three stories are interesting; the two clerks in the hotel provide comic relief and a bit of tissue connecting the stories. I enjoyed the stories, but found the director's decision more interesting, so much so that I watched three times, once for the stories, once for the technique, and once just to enjoy an off-beat movie in which the seedy side of Memphis becomes a character in its own right -- and ties everything together.
