8764934,5,B01HC26L4M,"Questar, Inc. re-released this unique and imaginative series in a new packaging design (6-DVDs within a case the size of a single-amaray case), which is great because, for a moment there, I thought it was no longer available.  The subject of miraculous occurrences have been around probably as long as humanity, and this series touches on that subject through 13 very creative, well-done episodes.  Great job to those who had a hand in its creation-",1477008000,5,449,4.973333333333334
