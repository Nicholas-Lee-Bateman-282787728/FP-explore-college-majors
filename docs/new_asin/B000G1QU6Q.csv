8128495,4,B000G1QU6Q,"ROMA CITTA LIBERA, something of a fizzle in its day and virtually unseen for over fifty years, has turned up in one of No Share's spiffy DVD transfers, providing many pleasures for fans of 40's Italian film.  Filled with too many formula picture touches to really qualify as neorealism, ROMA nevertheless features many familiar faces from the great movies of the period -- de Sica and Valentina Cortese, for starters.  The actors, writers, director, cinematographer and composer (you'll recognize Rota's principal song here from its reuse in Fellini) may have all achieved greater glory elsewhere, but ROMA's wry wit and wistful humanity cast a melancholy spell that's frequently pure magic.  If this picture piques your interest, chances are you'll find it quite enjoyable.",1171584000,8,774,5.276422764227642
