5079041,5,B007D53JIA,I  had a food mover years ago and did not know they were still available. I ordered it on Amazon. It was just what I was looking for! I am very happy!,1362787200,16,150,3.6875
5079042,5,B007D53JIA,"I had this sent to my son's house because he' Pre Diabetic and he needs help losing weight. It's like the plan the Diatition gave him and I lost 48 pounds in 1988 on this program, so I know it's balanced and works.",1362700800,22,214,4.0
5079043,5,B007D53JIA,"its a great tool,teaches you have to eat more fruits and veggies and less starches,i like how the windows shut too control your eating .and the amout of water you need,and how you change charts has the weight goes down,i tell all my friends how great it is,",1361750400,14,257,4.375
5079044,4,B007D53JIA,"(I haven't viewed the DVD).  The ""mover"" unit is real unique.  It comes w/cards for 1400-1800 & 2000-
Calorie diets; you slide the chosen one into the unit's slot.  On the front, there are numerous sliding
Windows which display the icons/emblems on the chosen card.  As you use one of these foods/liquids,
you close the window.  (Of course, by the end of the day, I still have water & veg. windows to use, but
have ""overdrawn"" the starchs or fats!  You DO have to be your own ""scorekeeper"").

The kit also contains (besides the DVD) 2 books--one explaining how to use the unit & the other giving
more details & food lists.

Until they come out w/something that has a Tough-love Genie inside, this is a pretty good method.
Oh, & the unit (minus books) is apx. the size of a slim wallet, so you can carry it in your purse.",1360886400,5,820,4.3841059602649

5079046,5,B007D53JIA,"I think this is an easy plan to follow and to enjoy while you are doing it.  You can choose all of your favorite foods and learn to eat them with portion control so you will never feel deprived.  The exercise part is straight forward and fun.  His exercise videos include you in his classes so you never feel alone and he shows you on all of them how to use them to what ever level of exercise that you are able to do.  His motovational tape is very sincere and inspiring.  I recommend this and some of his exercise videos to anybody at any weight, you will be able to do them in your own home at your own pace.",1343174400,37,611,4.016528925619835
5079047,5,B007D53JIA,"How can anyone argue with the food mover?  It is all diets in one!  The only things I did was take a sharpie and put the calories above the food, like ""30"" about extras.  Then if I have a mixed meal or casserole, etc, I can be sure all my calories are accounted for.",1440201600,,266,3.888888888888889

5079050,3,B007D53JIA,The motivational dvd is great.  I love it.  The reason I rate this 3 stars is because the motivational dvd was all I got.  There was no food mover or anything else.  Just the dvd.,1434067200,,179,4.0285714285714285

5079062,4,B007D53JIA,"I think this is a very useful tool for keeping track of what you eat without counting calories.
I would recommend this if you want to keep track of what you are eating to lose weight.",1402531200,,183,4.111111111111111

5079064,5,B007D53JIA,I absolutely love this program. It has to be honest the only real lifestyle change that ever worked until of course I had another baby and started eating everything in sight. I would highly recommend it.,1400457600,2,203,4.666666666666667

I would  tell every one to get one even the people who don't have problems dieting because you forget during the day what and how many veg and fruit you have had and this will remind you what you had and what you have to have yet.  Great item",1399161600,2,335,3.7714285714285714
5079066,5,B007D53JIA,"Richard Simmons really know how to lose weight.. You are never hungry, and if so he makes you not feel guilty snacking.. Thanks Richard.. Lost 12 pounds in 1 month..",1398729600,2,165,4.533333333333333
5079067,5,B007D53JIA,"I bought 2 of these; for my husband, who has never dieted, and for myself.  I had enjoyed success after using his system years ago.  Hubby gave us a scare recently with some chest pain that took him to the hospital.  Dr's orders, He MUST change his lifestyle and diet.  I am changing right along with him so we can enjoy his upcoming retirement!  Working with someone who has never dieted before, this makes it simple to explain the process!  Lots of common sense in this plan.  Having ""dining out"" rules detailed is a bonus.  I was using an online program to track calories, carbs, sodium, etc. It works but takes lots of time each day.  I was very happy to find this option for an amazing price.  It will simplify my days.",1398211200,,724,4.37593984962406
5079068,5,B007D53JIA,New in package. Arrived within the time frame given. Would recommend this to anyone considering a helpful way to track food portions and to get a variety of food groups without eliminating any.,1397952000,,193,4.878787878787879
5079069,5,B007D53JIA,Made weight loss easy and sensible. I lost about one pound per week but have kept it off. It forces you to think about what you eat. You need to be mindful of portion sizes in order for this to work. I downloaded a visual list of portions for common foods and stuck to those portion sizes.,1394409600,,289,4.087719298245614
5079070,5,B007D53JIA,"I ordered 3 of these, one for me and one for each of my parents. This is an excellent product. No more counting those dreaded calories, fats, sugars, carbs or proteins. Just slap the appropriate card into the food mover and you're good to go. This little gadget does all the thinking and calculating for you. It breaks down your food for the day into all the food groups (veggies, fruit, grains, proteins, fats and dairy). Pick and choose what you want and close the appropriate window. Once all your windows are closed, that's it you're done eating for the day. What's nice is that you even get a little booklet that you use as a reference when picking your food choice so that you know exactly which window and how many to close. This program works because you are finally accountable for your food choices and weight loss goals.

The reference book you get with this even will help you to pick healthy choices when going to a restaurant.

I also would recommend buying Richard Simmons Party off the Pounds DVD to go with your food mover. Results are better if you combine the Food Mover with exercise. In just 1 month I dropped 6 pounds and 2 inches off my waist. The DVD is fun and makes the workout go by fast sweating to the 80s.

As usual Richard makes everything concerning weight loss fun and this is another example how he turns our battles with weight into a positive, easy and affordable program.

This works, give it a try, you have nothing to lose but pounds!",1393891200,4,1473,4.4646840148698885
5079071,5,B007D53JIA,This is very easy to follow and there's no counting calories or carbs. I've lost six pounds in two weeks by following this plan. Need I say more?,1390780800,,145,4.214285714285714
5079072,4,B007D53JIA,"I had been using My Fitness Pal on and off to track calories.  I noticed that using it made me a little too obsessive and compulsive about manipulating the numbers, if you have seen how MFP calculates calories.  I would constantly change my goals and obsess over exercise calories, and basically live on the site switching numbers.  It would set off binge eating for me.  Not really a healthy relationship with food that way.  The forums were not really supportive either.  I've tried just paper and pen but that doesn't seem to work for me.  I've tried low carb with no calorie counting, that just doesn't work for me.  I can put away A LOT of steak, like half a cow, and eat an entire rack of lamb in the blink of an eye the same day, all covered in butter of course.

I had originally purchased this for my husband who wouldn't log into his MFP account regularly.  He didn't use this regularly either.  He had a lot of frustration figuring out the portions and how many windows to close.  He was self-conscious about pulling this thing out outside of at home.  So this is not for everyone.  You really have to want to make an effort to track what you eat.  It won't do it for you.  You have to also be ok with pulling out a purple contraption people will ask you about in public.

So, I decided to try it to see if it was really that hard.  I've found that for me, this works.  I have modified it ,though, to suit my needs.  I think there are way too many starch portions on the card.  If I ate that much starch and fruit, I would have a very very hard time losing weight.  I am trying to halt pre-diabetes, so the cards don't work for me as they are.

Right now, I have the 1800 calories card in there, but it is highly customized.  I crossed out all the starches and keep those windows always closed.  I scratched out two of the fruit windows and keep those closed.  I opened all the protein and fats windows and added a little drawing for the blank protein window.  For the extras, I wrote in the star values as 100 calories each to make up for the closed starches.  I found it easier to write the calorie values in the boxes as outlined by the food guide.  That way, instead of trying to figure out exchanges, I can google the calories and then close the windows accordingly.  I made it so my windows add up to 1430 calories.

So why not just use an online calorie tracker to do the same thing?  My answer would be this, if you are the kind of person where physically doing something like shutting a window makes it more final in your head, compared to manipulating numbers on a computer, you will probably stick with this better.  Yes, I could just flip up the windows and cheat, but to me, once I put the window down, it's down, that's it.  I also find the motivator windows helpful.  When I first saw them, I thought they were totally cheesy.  My husband never used them because they were silly to him.  To each his own.  I am an emotional eater, these little reminders can take the edge off because you have to actually look at them each time you look at the foodmover.  The little statements will float into your head at some point in the day just by virtue of seeing them, even if you don't even touch the windows on them.  I think that is helpful.

The vegetable windows are the last to get closed for me, so I end up eating vegetables at night, thereby having a smaller night time meal than I normally would  That is an unexpected positive for me.

I think this is worth a try for the price.  The dvd was ok.  If I was having a horrible food day, it might motivate me to keep going.  I could take or leave the dvd.  The foodmover itself can be a great tool.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't think it's perfect the way it is, I had to make my own changes.  I could also see how the windows could be annoying to deal with.  My mother has arthritis in her hands and couldn't deal with the windows.

I need to add that I have had to keep this off limits from my kid who likes to play with the windows which messed me up when first starting out.  But, by now I have enough grasp on my system that I know what windows were open or not.",1390348800,25,4153,4.166246851385391
5079073,5,B007D53JIA,"The Foodmover is a Godsend (so is Richard Simmons).  This is a great program that will not leave you starving.  It is all about portion control and eating the way you should.  It is so simple.  It works. Please get it.  Also, you need to exercise daily, so get one of Richard Simmons's DVDs.

5079083,2,B007D53JIA,I wasted my money on this one thinking it could be used as some guide to my portion control when dieting. The keys on this gadget or in the little windows showing what you can eat get stuck often that I have put some pressure on it and the window flaps can easily open up whenever you move it making it impossible to keep tract of what food groups you at already and need to eat...too much work with this gadget and a waste of money.,1366070400,,433,4.046511627906977
