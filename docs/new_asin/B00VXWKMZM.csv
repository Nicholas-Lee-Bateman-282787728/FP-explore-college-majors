8711713,2,B00VXWKMZM,"Micah Brock and his Whirlwind Action team are just a few folks looking to share how cool the martial arts can be. Their vehicle of choice for doing so was the Slug Street Scrapper series - a collection of four films of varying lengths that simulate the experience of classic fighting games. This second volume of the series  containing the last two features  represents the franchise as well as the first, and Im sorry to say that its not very good. Brocks vision is unique, but its delivery is questionable and so is the action content. Established fans will love this and may be happy to pay the price, but everyone else is better off finding the series online, lest this be an expensive disappointment.

Beat Em Up  This is the only installment of the entire series that would universally be considered a feature film, given its 79-minute runtime. Sadly, this is a little long for a pseudo-comedy that stretches out its video game gimmick from the title to the credits: the bad emoting and curious interactions so common in games are recreated faithfully, but its the films only joke and it gets old quickly. The characters are colorful, but theres way too many of them to keep track of. The nine fight scenes are occasionally creative, and I love the clashing of distinct martial art styles, but their presentation is very basic and the choreography is limited to them fighting upright in open spaces. Brocks made a big deal about how these fights are choreographed full-contact with the performers actually striking each other, but this really does not come across: I cant recall a single instance wherein I winced at how painful a particular blow must have been.

Goodbye Goddess  This is the superior of the two features, not the least of all because its 25 minutes shorter and thereby has greater success focusing its odd storyline. Additionally, the film chops its character roster in half, eliminating some of the cooler personas but giving the remaining performers more room to shine. The goofy stylistic choices are not only still present, but accentuated by how Brock apparently decided to screw his established storyline and begin the last feature of his series with totally different plot points. On the plus side, the fights are looking a lot better: they're still completely bereft of stuntwork or anything exceeding the basic abilities of the performers, but not only is choreography more creative, but theres also a good deal more ingenuity in how the fights are presented, including some interesting point-of-view camera angles.

Individually, I would rate Beat Em Up two stars and Goodbye Goddess three stars. On a good day, I might rate the set higher than I do now, but because the time I spent being bored while watching eclipsed the time I spent being intrigued, I have to be honest and give this one low marks. I hope that Whirlwind Action is not done producing action flicks, because they have a lot of potential  all they need now is a better director.",1449360000,,2980,4.818003913894325

8711717,5,B00VXWKMZM,"The amount of skill on display is jaw dropping. The witty repartee will make you squirt a beverage up your nose. Trying to follow the story line will require a chiropractor... ok it's just fun to say that...  Great to watch with friends and family as a noisy occasion. I wouldn't throw toast, if you get that reference, but watching all your friends try to do some of the kicks and combos after should cause a bit of hilarity. Enjoy! -AG",1430006400,,437,4.395061728395062
