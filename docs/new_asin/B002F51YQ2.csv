8368779,2,B002F51YQ2,"I love these kinds of videos.  Got this becuase I watched some of their YouTube videos and wanted more.

This DVD is pretty boring.  Tons of bad camera shots, the same stuff over and over, and bad techno music.  The entire video has techo in the background.  Beyond these guys being idoits, you can't even enjoy the sounds of the engines and exhaust.

I can't recommend spending $20 on this.",1362441600,,391,4.514285714285714
8368780,5,B002F51YQ2,"I thought this was fun to watch and will watch again.  It is not a movie about professional racers, but rather a group of people with expensive cars driving them like they are rentals.  I enjoyed seeing the Ford GT in action, (that was one of the main reasons I bought this.) This movie shows the ""Bull Run"" across the US and other high speed driving.  If you are expecting non-stop police pursuits, that is not what this movie is about, although there are a couple of police chases.  Not a video for your teenager learning to drive because of the disreguard for the law ( and some bad language.)  I gave it five stars because I would buy it again and this a love it or hate it type of movie.",1358467200,,692,4.212121212121212
