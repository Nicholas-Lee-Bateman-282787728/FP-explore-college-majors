7562843,5,B01953CL7W,"Was lucky enough to see this on television. I believe the selling price is more if you contact pbs for it, so this is a good deal. They did a great job here, including interviews with the pair's living relatives. On her grandmother not allowing them to be buried together, Bonnie's great niece said something like, ""She [the grandmother] said he had her life, he couldn't have her in death."" Was very cool to hear about them from such a perspective... What honestly surprised me most was how compelling this story was; I can see now why the two are considered Outlaw legends.

One thing that I wish I could've heard more about is that of Clyde's brother and his wife. They were traveling with B&C when they were ambushed by police. Although Bonnie and Clyde escaped, Clyde's brother was killed while his wife was blinded and subsequently arrested. I was interested in hearing more about her, but I guess there wouldn't have been much else to say about that.

All in all, this was very informative and engrossing. I would probably pay this price to see it again if I had the money. (C'est la vie.)",1453593600,6,1096,4.558375634517766

A really good documentary that provides the watcher with insight into the time period, and who these people really were.  Never understood why they were seen as folk heroes.  This program provides one with a real understanding of the desperate  times and the affects of the depression on average people. Even today many people don't like banks, but in Bonnie and Clyde's day, there was a real hatred for banks and admiration for those who robbed them.  Well worth watching.",1484697600,2,506,4.905882352941177

7562918,4,B01953CL7W,"Excellent documentary that humanized two wanton criminals without mawkishly excusing the heinous nature of their crimes.  This documentary also did an excellent job of conceptualizing Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow and placing their crime spree in the geographical and economic circumstances of their times.  Crime seemed almost inevitable for Clyde Barrow, given the poverty and crime-ridden family he was born into, but it was not for Bonnie Parker.  Parker's affiliation and love affair with Barrow seems to have been the impetus for her life of crime.  This documentary is a solid and very interesting look at the lives of these two American criminals.",1476230400,4,656,5.339805825242719

It gives much insight into why and how their lives were formed which led to the life of crime that enveloped them later on. We see where they went from petty crimes that came out of boredom and the hard times during the depression. Even though their love for each other was a bit twisted, they were totally devoted to each other and were together until the very end. They started with what could be called petty crimes, but ended up being rather cold, calculating with a penchant for killing. The show described the excitement they experienced by being on the run on the road to the redundancy of always having to keep moving and watching over their shoulders for the law. I may watch this one again.  Remember children, crime doesn't pay!",1470787200,4,908,4.469879518072289

7563006,1,B01953CL7W,"As do most such ""documentaries"", this one glorifies and romanticizes these two criminals.

I understand the importance of reporting how they were romanticized in the context of the time, but as viewed from today, they were just a couple of criminals. Their ""love affair"" is, in my opinion, greatly exaggerated and overblown. Maybe I'm cynical, but I expect that it was an affair of convenience as much or more than it was true love.

What, exactly was the purpose of putting the two nephews in cowboy hats? Was the story not glamerous enough? And where were family members of the murdered victims to tell their side?

I suppose this was okay for entertainment, but as far as historical documentaries go, it was sadly lacking.

I love the way this program refuses to treat historical characters as flat, 2-dimensional players in a world where it's good vs bad, black vs white. While there is no defending the crimes committed by these two, there are definitely factors about their backgrounds, and the workd they lived in, that one should consider, when learning about their story. As usual, The American Experience looks beyond the surface, and fleshes Bonnie and Clyde out in such a way that they feel like real people - not heroes or villains...just deeply flawed human beings.",1469923200,3,621,5.038834951456311

7563027,5,B01953CL7W,"Sometimes I see a five star rating and wonder concerning the qualification of the person who gave the rating.  When it comes to popular history I just personally like to get more information than what I had access to before.  This documentary did that for me, so I was pleased for that reason.  Obviously there is always more to a story than a film or documentary will focus on.  Back during my high school years in east Texas I saw the Hollywood movie with Fay Dunaway.  That would have been about 34 years after the actual events.  As a more seasoned adult, I can easily remember back far longer than 34 years.  My high school drama teacher back in 1968, who was likely born right about the time of these events, and whose parents likely had a much better feel of the popular perception during the period of Bonnie and Clyde's infamy, had a far less romantic impression of Bonnie and Clyde than the Hollywood movie painted.

Thus after seeing my teacher's disgust, my curiosity was piqued, and I read a book, but that too did a bit of romanticizing.  This documentary filled in some gaps.  As horrific as some of the pictures in the documentary were, I remember seeing far more horrific pictures in a  book I read at a public library when I was in Southern California back during the summer of 1970.  Those photographs in that book made it very clear Bonnie and Clyde were were shot dead!  This may well have been in keeping with popular sentiment at the time.",1469577600,7,1462,4.492424242424242
7563028,5,B01953CL7W,"I expect high quality programs from PBS, and I wasn't disappointed. The video was informative and engaging without being salacious. I appreciate that it established the historic context to explain how criminals like Bonnie and Clyde could not only exist and thrive, but even rise to a nearly celebrity status. It was interesting to see that the biggest difference between the media coverage then versus now is the speed at which it was delivered. It was more interesting to realize that there is no difference at all in the public's insatiable appetite for it. In a sense, Bonnie and Clyde were the precursors of, and prototypes for, that portion of reality television that celebrates bad behavior.",1469491200,2,698,5.025862068965517

8743987,4,B01953CL7W,"This documentary was more in-depth with more photographs and footage than others I'd seen before. The duo remain mysterious to me, even now, especially Bonnie. I can understand her falling in love with a career criminal, but the reasoning behind her joining him on and participating in his exploits escapes me. I understand she was bored. But she was also intelligent and a good writer who could have furthered her education, pursued writing, and led a longer, more fulfilling life. On the other hand, she was also clearly somewhat wild and lacked direction, I do not understand why she chose to jeapordize everything over a man. Perhaps there was an emptiness inside that she believed only Clyde (or romantic love) could fill.

Another reviewer said his North Texan ancestors sat up at night standing guard with shotguns when it was believed Bonnie and Clyde were in the area. Folks were more frightened than proud of them, apparently, the whole ""Robin Hood"" image being largely a myth. You don't hear stories of locals hiding or aiding them. It appears they were quite on their own.
