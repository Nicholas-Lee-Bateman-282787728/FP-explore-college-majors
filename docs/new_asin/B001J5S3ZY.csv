8311971,4,B001J5S3ZY,"if you totally suspend belief and focus instead on what can be done with an inverse ratio of good taste to money, this movie is worth a watch. The ideas aren't fresh, but like letting the talented cook in your family use your leftovers, there are unexpected tastes. Everyone has the lottery example, such as how against all odds, Bad Taste led to Lord of the Rings, Evil Dead to Spiderman, etc, artfully choosing to forget how much more likely it is that for every shot to video labor of love is a bankruptcy and ruined family. This is more like a couple guys enjoying themselves AND getting a movie out of the deal, without having to use air quotes and learning experience in their justifications of what they have done.",1455580800,,721,4.511450381679389
8311972,5,B001J5S3ZY,"It is what it is, a low budget ""B"" indie movie.  If you want an over the top Hollywood blockbuster with overpaid actors & advertising then find something else.  The acting and story line are OK, the gory effects are as cheesy as they come...it is what it is.

I gave this film 5 stars because it was exactly what I thought it would be when I was looking for a low budget indie ""B"" movie.  There are plenty enough reviews on the film including YouTube clips to decide for yourself if it is ""right"" for you and your taste in bad films. If you research it, buy it, then get mad....don't blame the movie, blame yourself and get over it.

I'm looking forward to the next release from cafedeath just because they take the time to make a movie (no matter how good or bad it is)instead of just sitting back to see the next flop to come out of Hollywood.",1304985600,3,845,4.191358024691358
8311973,1,B001J5S3ZY,"How bad is this movie? Let me count the ways. The production value looks as though they had about $100 for the budget, and spent $75 of it on cheap beer for the crew. They surely didn't spend it on the acting, which is atrocious. How inbred hillbillies have a hard time acting like inbred hillbillies is beyond me. Also, the movie is ridiculously unfunny. It's as if there's an inside joke somewhere, but I can't find it, so hopefully the filmmakers can, at least. I saw this flick for free at a horror convention years ago, and I actually wanted to walk out after 20 minutes, though I never do that because I always want to give a movie a chance. So my buddy encouraged me to stay, and I'm glad I did. And I encourage any and all of you that are minutely interested in this movie to see it. Don't pay the astronomical price that they're asking here because it's not worth the DVD it's printed on, but see it nonetheless. See it and tell the world. When someone says that the new Michael Bay blockbuster or the new Disney flick is the worst film they've ever seen, show them this and sit back and relax as they're taken on a journey to just how low movie-making can go. Just make sure you warn them in advance.",1282953600,,1210,4.265217391304348
8311974,5,B001J5S3ZY,"I just wanted to clear up a few details about this movie.

But first a few quotes:

 ""Best described as Pink Flamingos meets Redneck Zombies""
  ...Pericles Lewnes (Director Redneck Zombies & LOOP)

 ""It's like a Tex Avery cartoon spun out on meth!""
  ...b-independent.com

The movie is presented in Widescreen format.
Running Time is 98mins.

The extras include:
*Outtakes
*Director Commentary
*Cast Interviews
*Short Film

For those interested here is the whole review from Pericles:

""I watched Better Living Through Killing, which is best described as Pink Flamingos meets Redneck Zombies. Director Brendan Deininger has a unique style and has created three franchise characters - Brothers Otis and Welford and their bad influence, Professor Bonaparte, all of whom I certainly hope to see more of in future sequels. BLTK is a back-lawn barbecue of arterial spray, glistening guts, ample bosom and cheap beer.
You'll go back to this movie again and again.""

That's about it - if you want more head over to [...]

One final note - while influenced by many - this movie is an homage to the great Nathan Schiff - specifically 'They Don't Cut The Grass Anymore' You should check him out.",1231372800,2,1185,5.005128205128205
