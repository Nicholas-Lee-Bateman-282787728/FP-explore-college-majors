2002841,5,B0001HAGQK,"Aaron Sorkin is a prodigy. Nobody can write dialogue that simultaneously sounds so polished and natural like he can. He also can write well for people: his characters are believable, flawed, and heroic, and his view of the world is realistic, yet optimistic. I find myself missing my weekly dose of Sorkin's West Wing these days, but there is a prescription that can help: the West Wing DVD sets of yesteryear.
The West Wing's second season had the show really hitting its stride. The season starts in the aftermath of the previous season's cliffhanger, with the President and Josh being shot by white supremacists and everyone else struggling to get through it all. Interspersed throughout the episode (In the Shadow of two Gunmen) were flashbacks to Bartlet's presidential campaign, a framework which really worked for the episode, although I cannot put my finger on how. Then, we were off to the races. I'll never forget Bartlet's vitriolic speech to the Dr. Laura-type pundit in ""The Midterms,"" good material to remember if you ever get engaged in a debate with someone who likes to pick and choose which parts of the Bible they like to follow. ""Do I have to kill my brother for planting different crops side by side?"" Great stuff. Among the rest of highlights: Emily Procter begins her recurring role as Ainsley Hayes, a Republican lawyer working in the White House and constant sparring partner for Sam. Her best episode here was ""And It's Surely to their Credit,"" which evoked much empathy for the poor soul. Plus, an impassioned speech at the end by Sam really got the juices flowing. The episode that just blew me away was ""Noel"", a haunting and poignant foray into Josh's head that really showed his pain underneath the facade of composure. The scene with Yo-Yo Ma alone was unbelievably intense. Perhaps the defining moment in the season is the discovery by Toby, and subsequently everyone else, that the President has Multiple Sclerosis, which is impressively explored in the episode ""17 People"". The episode takes the form of a series of fiery dialogues between Toby and the President and is filled with tension, but is lightened up by its subplot of staffers trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with jokes for the President. The juxtaposition is inspired, and the episode sets up what would become a key issue in the show for the upcoming season. ""Two Cathedrals"" was another episode with such raw emotional power -- the president announces his M.S. and contemplates whether or not to run. The final shot alone will send chills down your spine. This was surely Sorkin's best season on the show, in terms of narrative power (and that says a lot). It's what he does best: portraying the complex and jagged emotions that pervade us, consciously and subconsciously. Lord knows I miss him. Come back, Aaron. Please! We need you now more than ever.
In conclusion, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative (or whatever in between), this is a show that you can enjoy. This is substantial entertainment, there's comedy, but also pathos, problems to solve and the interplay of emotions, ideas, and forces outside our control. Words cannot convey my deep respect for this show (and I don't even consider myself liberal). Get it, and see television as it once was, and as it might again be one day.",1082073600,24,3323,4.883185840707965
2002842,5,B0001HAGQK,"... the best drama episode ever seen in the history of television - probably.
Counting the days.",1080345600,3,96,4.705882352941177
2002843,5,B0001HAGQK,"The last season ENDED in a brutal cliffhanger with an attempt on the President or Zoe. The last scenes were the staff and bystanders diving for cover as gunmen shot from windows in a nearby building. This season opens trying to untangle the confusion of that night and opens a rich, second season of the best drama on television. We are also treated to some great pre-first season moments, when the staff was managing Bartlet's presidential campaign. From my count there were 17 Emmy nominations this season - for writing, acting, and more - I've noted the episodes that were winners. My only complaint is that they're making us wait so long for these sets, when people overseas have had them already for almost a year - come on, it's OUR idealist leadership. But to quote the deputy press secretary, ""let's forget that you're a little late to the party and just embrace the fact that you showed up""

2002844,5,B0001HAGQK,"I think that in many cases, the second season of a TV show is its best season.  Why is TV so often completely opposite from sophomore efforts in music and movies?  From my own observations it's because in the second season of a TV show, the actors have gained a comfortable grasp on how to portray the deeper parts of their character.  At the same time, the show still has the freshness of a new show, the same rich texture that won it a debut to begin with; the writers are still developing plots that don't feel stale, so the show hasn't lost that ""new car smell"".  Of course there are exceptions: shows that run out of steam soon after they start, and shows that just seem to keep getting better even after the second season.
I don't know if The West Wing's second season is its best, but it definitely includes some of the best episodes.  Great writing, great acting, great sets and music, all come together to form what has become my favorite TV show ever.
Season Two includes these episodes:
In The Shadow of Two Gunmen (Part 1)
In The Shadow of Two Gunmen (Part 2)
The Midterms
In This White House
And It's Surely To Their Credit
The Lame Duck Congress
The Portland Trip
Shibboleth
Galileo
Nol
The Leadership Breakfast
The Drop In
Bartlet's Third State of the Union
The War at Home
Ellie
Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going to Jail
The Stackhouse Filibuster
17 People
Bad Moon Rising
The Fall's Gonna Kill You
18th and Potomac
Two Cathedrals
(You can look up an episode guide if you want a quick summary of the plots; I didn't want to spoil any surprises here.)
I doubt Warner will include the special episode ""Isaac and Ishmael"" in this set.  This episode was written after the 9/11 attacks, and aired a week before the start of Season Three; thus, if it is included with a regular season, it will probably be the third.",1077494400,80,1840,4.477611940298507

I bought this last year but didn't watch it until a month ago (June 2014) since I moved out-of-state and am still unpacking.

You can learn a great deal about the real difficult decisions that go on in politics as they often explore many sides of an issue or the trivial nature of how major policy is proposed and supported. Compromise of ideals are the challenge in every episode. It is smart and fast and addicting!

Too bad Amazon Prime view is no longer free. Is this the bate and switch? Not for me. I will never pay $2 per episode to watch. So I guess it the show is just not worth the money since I have already seen it before. However, a competitor has it available for less than $8 per month , which is worth it.

2002997,5,B0001HAGQK,"West Wing is a superior script by Sorkin and Welles.  It underscores what the problems are that all White House staff members face and presents them in a patriotic and focused manner to remind everyone of what America was meant to be.  My family was very disappointed when the series went off the air.  There is little that fills the void in ""thinking programs"" that both provide ACCURATE information about the role of government and instill a longing for the American Dream.",1403222400,,475,4.7682926829268295

I really enjoy this series. I find it entertaining, educational and a reinforcement to my inherent pride as an American patriot.
Scripts are diverse and you don't need to see every episode in order to follow along. I really enjoy the writing, except that the dialogue is essentially a monologue. Other than differences in roles and a little personality, any character could say any line... I do enjoy the series but it becomes apparent early on that this is a unilateral effort and there is really only one character.",1402358400,,704,4.595238095238095

2003009,5,B0001HAGQK,"I had forgotten how much I love these characters with their humanity, intelligence and incredible dialogue.  I watched 11 Season One episodes while headed outbound from Boston to Africa and eleven more coming home.  Fourteen hours on a crowded plane with babies crying and I was a content, if not happy, traveler.  My grown son once referred to this series as ""democratic soft porn.""  I agree and I am so addicted that I am consuming the second season at a maintenance dose of one a night as a reward for productive activity during the day.  The scripts by Sorkin and Co hold up better than you would expect and occasional preaching is immediately mitigated by laugh-out-loud one liners and even physical comedy.  I didn't remember how many pratfalls they managed to include. The so-called special effects are showing their age as we are now accustomed to more sophisticated computer generated imagery.  But now I am nitpicking.  Go for it, especially if you have a liberal bent and missed this series the first time around; but start at the beginning with Season One.

Managed carefully, regular visits with the president I always wanted to have in the White House will see me through until the autumn return of ""The Newsroom"" to HBO.  I hope Sorkin lives forever.",1402012800,,1265,4.814814814814815

these it seems to be only at work, since they work all the time.

Sorta like Riker's beard.) and it includes the all-time best episode ""Someone's goin' to Emergency. ..""  The Bartlett Administration's take on McCarthyism, proto-Occupiers, and socially responsible cartography.  And it's cheesy in a good way.

Except maybe the last episode that uses flashbacks to explain some of Bartlett's struggles with faith. These three episodes should be on any West Wing top ten list. Sorkin is in prime. This rivals the first season for the best year. Noel, the tenth episode, finds Josh still suffering from the shooting's aftermath. And I found Shibboleth touching.",1391990400,,474,5.012658227848101

It is a show that I go back to every so often because of the writing and acting in it.  It shows us the inside story of the White House. It doesn't make any difference which party is in power.  it make you think of all the deals that our leaders have to face before a major decision.  You can't fine any better actors for the roles they are in.  West Wing is one of the very best series that will go on for a long time,1391558400,,562,3.810344827586207

2003104,5,B0001HAGQK,"I am surprised at how much I value watching ""The West Wing"".  Mostly it's intelligent discussion about surprising events in search of identifying the right/best decisions for how to handle complex circumstances.  Don't let that put you off as the writing is so engaging.  I think the best thing about it is that all the main characters are lovable individuals who truly respect each other.  They are together sincerely trying to do the right thing and most of the time the best answer is unclear but the consequences are serious for the nation.  Sometimes they end up gratified and sometimes they get it wrong and tear themselves up over the course of events that ensue.  Don't let the first episode put you off as there are so many characters to introduce.  By the second episode you will be enthralled.  It's surprisingly uplifting to watch.",1390867200,,843,4.805555555555555

Update July 2014:  Much to our surprise and consternation, Amazon has removed ""The West Wing"" from its Prime offerings.  I can understand why more recent shows might not be included in the paid-for Prime membership, but a show this old and this good was a valuable benefit of Prime.  One week we were watching it frequently, then BOOM! We noticed yesterday that it's pay-per-view.  We're very disappointed in Amazon for doing this.",1390089600,,657,4.972477064220183

2003144,5,B0001HAGQK,"Aaron Sorkin's writing and the cast are exceptional. The politics in the stories in every episode ring true even in 2013, when I am watching this series.

2003176,5,B0001HAGQK,"The West Wing, like many serial dramas, stretches story lines over several episodes or entire seasons. In addition to these larger story lines, each episode also contains smaller arcs that usually begin and end within an episode.
Most episodes follow President Bartlet and his staff through particular legislative or political issues. Plots can range from behind-closed-doors negotiating with Congress to personal problems like post-traumatic stress disorder, from which Josh suffers during the second season. The typical episode loosely follows the President and his staff through their day, generally following several plots connected by some idea or theme.",1383091200,,659,5.804123711340206
2003177,5,B0001HAGQK,I love the West Wing. The humor is fantastic. The only season I could do without is the last one (7?) but the rest of the series is really top notch. I highly encourage anyone on the fence to buy.,1383091200,,196,3.925

This series never gets old for me. The writing is crisp, and just when you think it is getting too wonky, boom. Sorkin brings in something that will make my heart burst, and I am reaching for the tissues.
I love the performances and I love the characters. I miss them, all of them, and getting to see them, even in the 21st century version of ""reruns"", is like spending time with old friends... friends you know so well that you can finish their sentences.
Thank you, Mr. Sorkin and Cast.",1382745600,,517,4.34020618556701

How I wish Aaron Sorkin stayed on as the lead writer for the West Wing. His departure after season 4 was obvious. The show was completely different, and I just couldn't watch it after that.

This is a collection I will watch again and again, and I'm so glad to see my kids finding interest in the series and in the process becoming more knowledgeable about our democracy.",1380844800,,469,4.379310344827586

2003190,4,B0001HAGQK,"Such a fantastic show.  Shows simply are not written as well as this any more.  Probably said the same thing when I reviewed season 1 but its that good.  I do not often ""Agree"" with political points this show makes, but first of all, I'm choosing to watch a political show so I can't assume there wouldn't be that.  Second, they write so well and evidently research a ton, so even the people making points against my views are doing so very intelligently which is so opposite of real life that its actually NICE to hear opposing views backed with real fact.  However, I cannot say the same for their Christian bashing.  Only one or two episodes each season, but when they do, they come down HARD and only show the ""Crazy"" extremist position vs the ""logical"" opposition.  Plus the arguments are terrible.  Get off the religious bashing soap box and this Show would be PERFECT.",1380499200,,875,4.564102564102564

2003192,5,B0001HAGQK,"I am probably a little biased but I have always loved this show. I know that some people feel it is very liberal and idealist, but I don't mind that because it is tv show not real life. I also love Sorkin's writing, particularly those quick back and forth conversations he does. Quite frankly I love the conversation in any setting, including his Studio 60 and Newsroom or a show with a less liberal setting.",1380153600,,408,4.453333333333333
2003193,5,B0001HAGQK,"This is one of my all time favorite shows.  Intelligent and brilliantly written with a terrific cast.  It might not be your thing if you're a staunch conservative, because it definitely appeals to a moderate or liberal base.",1380153600,,224,4.868421052631579

The end of the season got bogged down in President Bartlett's MS, who knew what, when did they know it and the pace of the action was slow and sluggish. 5 stars for the first 2/3 of the episodes, 3 stars for the last of the episodes. = 4 stars for the season. The writers seemed to have gone to a dark place and just sat there churning dark thoughts. This is not what I enjoy in entertainment.",1379116800,,444,4.0

2003206,5,B0001HAGQK,"I came to the West Wing late....I never saw it on television, but only later through Amazon and Netflix. How could I have missed a show so extraordinary? The writing is funny, smart, quick and thought provoking. Unlike popular shows today, there is a mix of humor and drama. There are no pat happy endings; the characters are complex and three dimensional, like all our dear but imperfect friends....like ourselves.

Anyway, I love love love this show, and it's probably a good thing I didn't find it until Amazon came along, because I would have gone out of my mind waiting for the next installment. I've watched the whole series through, devoured it truthfully and now I'm starting again, at a more leisurely pace....like good sex or a sumptuous meal. Aaron Sorkin is a genius, but much credit should also go to the people who decided to make this show, and kept it going after Sorkin left in Season 5.  They all are heroes in my book, and I am grateful.",1378252800,,956,4.584795321637427

It touches my heart every time I watch it. The acting is spot-on, terrific, awesome, fantastic!!!!

If you have never watched even one episode, you owe it to yourself to do so. I think once you do, you will be hooked.

Even though I had watched it when it was on TV, I was totally engrossed in the story again and especially enjoyed noticing little things I had completely forgotten.  This series is so superior to most of the continuing TV programs on now.  I guess I am too old to enjoy repetitive adultery, vampires and werewolves, deviant sexuality and grisly crimes.
I can imagine a bunch of mediocre writers sitting around a table and pondering what to throw into a story next to keep the audience's attention.  Usually I am embarrassed for the actors.  They seem to be trying too hard.

I am now finishing series 2 and look forward to more.",1376092800,,788,4.539007092198582

2003231,1,B0001HAGQK,I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD. One of the DVD's was continually sticking and very difficult to view. Another of the DVD's (there were 4 in all) would not load at all or play. Had no difficulty with other DVD's so the West Wing product that I received was defective.,1375833600,,285,4.296296296296297

2003239,4,B0001HAGQK,"After having watched the Complete First Season of this series, this second season was a bit of a dissapointment.  By now the pattern of handcam-led groups of people briskly threading the maze of Whitehouse corridors while hammering out convoluted solutions to world stunning problems has become cliche, and kind of distracting.

2003300,5,B0001HAGQK,"the west wing shows are almost mirror image of today's news & politics. I know it is fiction, but the writers were fantastic. I love Josh! The episode dealing with his PSDT was like what military dealing today.",1369440000,,210,4.552631578947368

If you want bright, witty, intelligent engaging, lyrical dialogue that will raise you up and fire up your grey matter for a change, delivered with master craftsmanship by every actor on the screen, no mater how large or small the role, this is the series for you.  Don't lose the remote because if you have to leave the room you'll want to pause the play to be sure you don't miss even one priceless second.  There isn't a single episode that will leave you wanting less, only more.  Some will break your heart, some will make you want to learn more and aspire to be a better person yourself.  One thing is certain, you won't be ambivalent or bored.",1369353600,,702,4.369230769230769

2003315,5,B0001HAGQK,"Aaron Sorkin, America's finest story teller (A Few Good Men, Social Network, Moneyball, Charlie Wilson's War), wrote one of the best television series ever.

2003317,5,B0001HAGQK,"Entertainment with a strong dose of contemporary governmental history.  This show's episodes explore just about every political / governmental scenario and event.  Though it is now over 10 years old, it seems that little has changed in the political arena of partisan politics, political shenanigans, and the good / bad / and ugly.  But this show does a much better job at exploring the how and why of it all than you ever get in our news media.",1368144000,,445,4.67948717948718

2003322,5,B0001HAGQK,"The West Wing season 2 is the gold standard for television and writing. It starts with the most dramatic season opening ever, and ends with a season finale that I still think is the greatest single hour of television in history.",1367625600,,228,4.585365853658536
2003323,5,B0001HAGQK,"Yes, it is fiction. It is idealized. It must be. If our politicians really were like Bartlet and his team, and had ""Cliff Calley""'s ethics when things became adversarial, and on and on... we would as a nation be in an extraordinarily different place. The writing is outstanding, the tensions palpable and (likely) realistic in the majority of scenarios (though not all of them), and the characters are well developed, really consistent, and understood with their flaws, talents and frailties. We recently began watching the eniter series and we look forward to two episodes a night....",1367366400,,585,5.104166666666667

2003327,5,B0001HAGQK,"We are big fans of The West Wing. Well-written, well-acted, and as politically relevant as ever!  Scary to think that we are - 10 years after the show first ran - still grappling with the same issues (taxes, gun control, terrorism, conflicts in the Middle East, women's rights, a failing educational system, etc.).

2003339,5,B0001HAGQK,I started watching and couldn't stop...I finished all seasons and all episodes.  I think I have a better understanding of how things work in our government.  This show was very interesting and well written and the performance of the cast was over the top.  I can't believe how many great actors/actresses were in this.  I could have enjoyed seven more years of it.,1366329600,,364,4.73015873015873
2003340,5,B0001HAGQK,"Can't believe I didn't watch this show when it was on tv.  Love, love, love.  It is great to be able to watch all the episodes for free with my Amazon Prime membership.  Well worth the cost of the membership.",1366243200,,208,4.15
2003341,5,B0001HAGQK,"It's smart, funny and takes on the big issues.  Doesn't dwell on romance and babies.  A grown up series for grown ups who like watching smarter than us, competent people making difficult, scary decisions that protect us",1366243200,,219,4.891891891891892
2003342,5,B0001HAGQK,I have seen all of Season One and the first episode of Season Two. I am savoring each episode and taking my time. The action is so fast paced and interesting. It also seems current which is surprising. I intend to see it all eventually. The acting is great...,1366243200,,259,4.3061224489795915

2003368,5,B0001HAGQK,This season continues to build on Season 1 with the disappointments that come when you can't get as many things done as you'd hoped in your first term. The MS disease story develops as the President is forced to tell the nation he has the incurable disease. Great work by Sorkin and his team. Basically every season is great except for 6 which drags.,1365811200,,350,4.484375
2003369,5,B0001HAGQK,There's no way to review the SECOND season of a TV show. All I can say is that this is the second time I have had to buy a copy of Season 2. I wore out all of my favorite episodes so that they kept skipping and stopping. I think Aaron Sorkin is the most creative writer for TV and movies who is working today.,1365724800,,309,3.769230769230769

2003389,5,B0001HAGQK,"The writing regarding both character development and their situations together and individually, added to the acting chops of the cast, kept me watching ""The West Wing"" sophomore season.  This season's well-crafted writing includes significant casting changes that unfolds within the scope of the story, exemplifying yet again why this series is ""must-see-tv""..  If you're a fan you don't need me to convince you, if you're not yet a fan, you only need to be curious enough to see what's the hub-bub.  I can honestly say, we've seen worse, but this ranks amongst the best.  May I add, I am thrilled to have this show offered within the PRIME instant videos program.

2003393,5,B0001HAGQK,"The rhythm, humor, intellect, sarcasm, quick wit, ideas, subject matter and depth of talent on this show, in my opinion, is unsurpassed. I have to hit ""pause"" several times a show, either because I'm laughing too hard and long to catch the next lines, or blown away by the moment, and have to say out loud, ""Oh my God, this this a good show!""

2003396,4,B0001HAGQK,The writers do some great research when developing the screenplay.  I enjoyed the early part of the season more than the later part.  It seemed the story line was weak in few later episodes.,1364515200,,190,4.5588235294117645

2003415,5,B0001HAGQK,This show is great!  The second season delivers as good as the first.  The writing is witty and charming.  You will instantly fall in love with all the characters if you have not already.  In addition there are a few more characters that add to the entourage of this great cast.,1363737600,,278,4.392156862745098

2003420,5,B0001HAGQK,"In the age of Honey BooBoo and the Kardashians, it is wonderful to have a show that is fast-paced, funny, heart-warming, and mind-broadening.  Though we have seen all the episodes of West Wing, Aaron Sorkin's writing demands that you watch again, this time picking up the tidbits you missed.

Except for a couple of misses, the casting is perfect.  Dialogue is thought provoking, as it presents multiple sides of a controversial issue.  This show gives Americans real insight into the workings of politics.",1363305600,,506,5.0602409638554215
2003421,5,B0001HAGQK,I like how this series doesn't seem to age though it is sad that we are still dealing in reality with a lot of the same issues today that were current a decade ago.,1363305600,,164,3.8529411764705883

2003425,5,B0001HAGQK,I watched all the episodes when they aired and am loving them once again.  Great program and I can watch them from my Kindle Fire.,1363219200,,130,4.2
2003426,5,B0001HAGQK,"What I said about season one which applies across the board:

This is a show all about politics, obviously. But it's so much more. It's touching, inspiring, witty, funny, intelligent, and thought provoking. And with all that it offers insight into all kinds of people's lives and political ideologies and helps to recognize that there are many different valid viewpoints, but underneath that we can still find common ground and work together.  It might be the best television show I've ever seen. I lean conservative, but as far as empathizing with the difficult lives and jobs of the white house, and thinking about how morals apply in difficult situations, this is it. But if you're looking sheerly for entertainment, every episode is quick paced, funny, and snappy.

On season 2:
I love that they don't replay story lines, they are doing a very good job of coming with original material. I feel that the characters are developing and changing which I appreciate. I like it when their personal lives come into their job and I'd like to see a little more of both that and the character development. The shooting from season one is great in showing their pasts, how they all came together and also how they deal with their jobs after the shooting.",1363219200,,1247,4.790697674418604

Powerful men and women caring to solve issues and striving to do it with integrity are showcased in The West Wing.  You feel as if you're walking with them as they visit the oval office and hash out foreign and domestic affairs. So Fun!,1362614400,,306,4.527272727272727

2003437,5,B0001HAGQK,"I saw the West Wing series a few years back, and enjoyed them. Now I'm watching them over again with someone else, and I'm enjoying them again. They are educational, witty, thoughtful, well-written and well-performed. What surprises me the most is that the issues addressed in the series are still applicable today in the real world, how sad is that considering the state of affairs of our government.",1362528000,,401,4.911764705882353

2003441,5,B0001HAGQK,"Slightly tongue in cheek, I'd say my religion is ""The Church of Aaron Sorkin"".  I personally relished each time I caught a musical comedy or Gilbert & Sullivan reference.  The episode pertaining to maps in our  American-centric view of the world should be required school viewing.  I loved the three space exploration/NASA- themed episodes.  Of course, I am Liberal, New Age, vegetarian, middle-aged woman, so, yeah, folks, I am a huge fan of the show.  I have scarcely touched on the series' role as an ongoing political and history meditation; surely we paid attention to President Bartlett's pronouncements the way we never did in Civics class.  Well, dang it all, I miss the show, I have watched the entire series at least three times; it is simply a benchmark of perfection.  I urge fellow TWWs to read (or, best option, to listen,  via Audbile.com) Rob Lowe's excellent memoir,  STORIES I ONLY TELL MY FRIENDS.  Mr Lowe's view on his role in TWW, and the skewed direction he felt it took, is -- put politely -- critical.  Actually, with everyone (me, too) falling all over themselves virtually glassy-eyed with adoration, Mr Low's sharpish remarks took me just enough behind the scenes of creation and production to remind me ... helloooo, it's television!  Final comment:  Alison Janney is my Heroine.  Not just the role ... the actress!  Brilliant!  Love to see her do Shakespeare!",1362355200,2,1389,4.918103448275862

2003443,5,B0001HAGQK,"Aaron Sorkin is possibly one of the greatest writers in the industry.  Combine that with the exceptionally talented ensemble and you're destined for success.  This is also one of the highest regarded shows in recent history, and you can tell why that is.  The show manages to capture powerful scenes filled with intensity and emotional resonance.  The only real issues I have with it are the inappropriate casting of Mandy (who was forced into the casting) and the amount of depression that comes from knowing that the level of intellect and wit that make this show so engaging don't occur in real life. . .",1362182400,,607,4.752380952380952

2003449,5,B0001HAGQK,"West Wing was my favorite show when before and now I enjoy it even more. The exchange between the cast is both funny and at times thought provoking. I always feel good after watching an episode. This show expresses a great example of what a team does when it is focused on one general cause. Regardless of the situation, the disagreements what have you, they come together because they are there to serve together. I love the dialogue.

The dialogue is so witty and entertaining. And relevant. and touching. There was only one year which struggled. That was the year that Aaron Sorkin stopped personally directing the show. However, it got back on track the next season and continued its run successfully, although I think it didn't ever quite measure up to those first four years, which I would say we're perfect.",1361836800,,527,4.728260869565218
2003452,5,B0001HAGQK,The first three seasons are maybe the strongest. Loses its way a tiny little bit in seasons 4 and 5 only to finish strong in seasons 6 and 7. Great acting and super strong writing. Works even after repeated viewing.,1361836800,,215,4.4
2003453,5,B0001HAGQK,The ease in resuming an area was a plus. The closed captions were of great help when the diction was no clear.

After being off the air for several years now I was in search for something to watch one evening and came across this in my library.  I loved this show and missed many episodes when working late, especially back in the day prior to TiVo and DVR.  I had the 1st and 7th seasons and purchased the remaining ones.

2003468,5,B0001HAGQK,"I never watched The West Wing when it was actually airing. But during the last month or two, I've been making up for that. This is a great show to watch. Aaron Sorkin's writing is known for one very wonderful thing: the ability to create complex, multi-layered and intelligent characters who are also interesting. Watching these people interact together, especially the nonverbal interactions, is just fun. This isn't a show to watch if you like a lot of action. Mostly it's dialogue and walking around the office, first with one person and then with another. But if you enjoy seeing people interact, and it does not bore you to listen to a lot of conversation about ideas and politics, this is a show you should not miss. It's also kind of interesting to compare what happens on the show with how things are now. I like the stories that are explored, I like the people, and I really like seeing everything through the lens of the last ten years or so.",1360627200,,952,4.573099415204679

2003477,5,B0001HAGQK,"While The West Wing may not be for everybody, those who enjoy snappy dialogue, compelling characters, and some good drama will find this show worth the time (and occasional effort). In addition to taking an engaging approach to the US political system, the writers of this show make great pains to illuminate both sides of many controversial social and political topics. They accomplish this while avoiding the pitfalls of one-dimensional characters (i.e. the ""bleeding-heart"" liberal, or the ""hothead"" conservative). And if the complexities of politics and social issues aren't really you thing, you can always just sit back and marvel at the writing and quick wit of  Aaron Sorkin (and his team). Give this show at least three episodes, and I imagine you will be hooked.",1360454400,,772,5.126984126984127

It's a shame broadcasting of this quality no longer exists. Although a left leaning show it depicts both left and right positions. It's uncanny that they were dealing with many of the same issues as we are today. I say bring it back with a new cast and deal with current events and issues.  Maybe more of our population can learn something. Unfortunately now it's about demographics. The smarter and or older watchers aren't in demand by the advertisers. Instead we just get more crappy reality shows. They better wake up soon because the population is getting older and wiser. We can cut the cable cord and watch the great shows of the past like The West Wing without their commercials. This show alone has made my Amazon Prime account a fantastic deal.

2003485,5,B0001HAGQK,"This season starts out explosively, with fast paced action, and ends with tragedy. We learn more of the personal history and motivation of each character including the President. Smart writing keeps the dialogue interesting enough that you could turn your head away for a few minutes and not miss the storyline.

I bought this one to replace a previously damaged one.",1356480000,,105,4.3
2003494,5,B0001HAGQK,"First, I must say that I bought the second season of ""West Wing"" (hereafter WW)  because I was missing ONE disc from season two; I own the entire Boxed Set, with early screenplay notes by Aaron Sorkin.  That is how MUCH I adore the WW, I consider it television, and all that TV could be, at its very finest. I could NOT be without my complete set.

When one considers that shows such as ""According to Jim"", and ""CSI:Miami"" made it far past WW's seven seasons, I believe we are in the ""plastic"" age of television, and I'm not referring only to all the breast implants on so many popular shows, although, now that I think about it, that's a pretty decent comparison.

The West Wing offered an insight, albeit, slightly biased, on how our government SHOULD work, and how real people DO work in the White House, every day, just as they are as I write this piece.  During President Clinton's time in the White House, Aaron Sorkin, the creator of WW, was given complete access to the White House in order to replicate authentic sets back in Hollywood/  I felt I truly was in the White House residence, Situation Room, Roosevelt Room, the White House Press Room, etc.

Sorkin created the ""walk and talk"", so common now, but unprecedented in 1999, characters actually talked while they were walking -  presumbably, they had PLACES TO GO. These were the President's closest aides, after all, and there was no time to waste. Sometimes, the talks were funny, sardonic, many were about serious stuff, as one would expect of ""stuff"" going on in the West Wing of the White House.

The superlative ensemble cast, which stayed almost intact (except for the unwise departure of Rob Lowe after season four - does anyone remember ""The Lion's Den""?), for seven years, worked hard, loved their country, and felt they were doing a great good. And they were doing television a great deal of good, simply by showing up, and speaking the lines in Aaron Sorkin's brilliant screenplays on a weekly basis.

I wish I could say the same for the lawmakers of today. I must admit, that for the last two presidential election years (2008 and 2012), I have gotten out my ""West Wing"" boxed set, watching what government COULD be. I am too sad for my beloved country to watch the ""real thing"" unfold.

Of course, there were episodes that were ""lesser than"", but, I will be forever, and collectively, grateful to actors Martin Sheen, the late John Spenser, Allison Janney, Rob Lowe, Bradley Whitford, Richard Schiff, Stockard Channing, Janel Maloney, Dule Hill, and others who rotated in and out,  until Jimmy Smits was tapped to replace President Josiah Bartley (Sheen) after eight years of duty.

To those who have never seen the West Wing, you may think I am waxing way too rhapsodic. I think not. Aaron Sorkin and the WW cast won many numerous Emmys during its short seven year tenure, and Mr. Sorkin went on to win an Academy Award for ""The Social Network"" in 2010. He now writes ""The Newsroom"" for HBO. ""West Wing"" it is not, however, I will take whatever crumbs Mr. Sorkin, Tommy Schlamme, et al, have left to offer me on what is now thrown up as ""television"".

Oh, if you DO decide to buy just one season, buy season two. It is worth it alone for the episodes, ""The Fall's Gonna Kill You"", ""18th and Potomac"", and Not at all last, ""Two Cathedrals"", which was hailed as one of the finest episodes of writing, cinemtography, sets, etc, in the HISTORY of television.

I kid you not. This was a ""Golden"" television series.",1354406400,4,3489,4.613893376413571

2003503,5,B0001HAGQK,"Back when I had money, I invested $75 in Amazon.com's Prime feature, which among other things lets me stream live video from a variety of sources, including movies and TV shows.

Being a would-be screenwriter, I am always looking for ways to improve my scripts, so I have been watching various TV shows over the last few months. In the last few weeks I have rediscovered 'The West Wing,' a show about a fictional President of the United States, Jeb Bartlett, played by Martin Sheen.

I have watched the season in order, so as not to break continuity, and I reached the end of season 2 just yesterday.

Before I continue, a bit of background on the series might be useful. President Bartlett has MS, but has hidden it from the public. Up until the second to last show of season 2, only 16 other people knew about his condition, including his doctor wife, who had been treating him. He had made a deal with her that he would only serve one term as president.

Now, as we come to the end of season two, his secret is about to come out, and he faces a choice of whether to run again and face the ire of not only his wife, but likely the Republicans and his own party. Not to mention the fact that he or his wife could face perjury charges because of mistakes made along the way, and impeachment too.

Into all this drama, we have a hostage situation in a foreign country. It is an extremely tense time and the drama is palpable.

Then, at the end of the second to last episode, the president's secretary, Mrs. Lanningham, is killed by a drunk driver.

My first thoughts on hearing that was 'WTF?' What on earth would make writers kill off a sweet old lady like that just as the drama of everything else was reaching a climax? I mean, really?!

As a writer I couldn't see the point of killing off a character like that. So it was with a degree of indignation that I watched the next episode, 'Two Cathedrals.' By the end of that episode, hell, even a quarter of the way through it, I was in tears. It takes a lot to make me cry.

We see Jeb at Mrs. Lanningham's funeral, and after it's over, he asks for some time alone in the cathedral, where he blames God and his lying about MS for her death and for everything else that has gone wrong. Then he tells God he can have the Vice President as the next candidate and leaves.

A tropical storm is now showering rain, lightning and thunder on the Capitol. President Bartlett asks one of his aides if this was unusual for May, and was told it had never happened before. He adds this to his list of things he blames God for, and when he is left alone in the Oval Office, the windows fly open suddenly and it storms and rains. He calls for Mrs. Lanningham out of habit and there she is.

She chastises him for blaming God for her death and tells him if he wants to blame anyone but himself for his problems, and the choice he has to make, then she doesn't want to know him. Then she's gone and the president is soaked.

He now goes before a press conference to discuss his disease and of course, the first question asked is 'are you going to run again?' He pauses, asks to repeat the question and then puts his hands in his pocket, having made up his mind, and then the camera fades.

Now, as I said, through most of this episode I was in tears, and since I was in the library at the time, I must have looked and sounded strange, but I couldn't help myself.

That was the single best episode of any program that I have ever seen, and all it cost was the life of a minor character.

I have to wonder, in whatever writing I do in the future, could I do that? Could I kill off someone small and unimportant to set up the best writing I could do?

I just don't know.",1345248000,4,3700,4.204802259887006

West Wing is a look into the (fictional) lives of the President, his family, and his closest advisors/staff as they navigate the Executive Branch's many pitfalls.  From wars to dinner parties, West Wing shows it all in a fascinating story.

You'll grow attached to these characters, from ""Lemon"" Limon to crazy CJ, and the rest of the team.  You'll feel proud of some of the choices they make, and stand disappointed alongside them when some things just don't work out the way they intended.

If you've never given West Wing a shot due to the recommendations of others, or simply because you feel it doesn't fit with your particular political outlook, I humbly suggest you give it a watch simply to formulate your own opinion.  I have the feeling more of you will be impressed than not.

2003523,5,B0001HAGQK,"I had the highest bid in a Playwrights Horizons auction for an autographed copy of the Noel episode and have been fascinated to compare the written version to what was actually shot. I bought it because I'm a huge fan of the series, of Playwrights Horizons, but especially of Aaron Sorkin. His dialogue is like music and I've heard actors refer to the specific rhythms created by the words and the importance of getting each syllable, line and interaction exactly right while making it sound real and unforced. The snarky people at Television Without Pity have a great term for it: speaking Sorkinese.

Reading the words was fascinating. 90% of what's said was what's written on the page. It was really fun to figure out what was happening with the other 10%. There are some minor deletions, I assume for timing constraints. There are also some changes of characters who are given the lines and it's really interesting to infer why: why does having Leo say the line make more sense than having Sam say the same words as originally written? Finally, the editing is as much a part of the story telling as the script or actors, and much of the impact of this episode came from powerful juxtaposition of visual images that were only briefly suggested on the page.  Schlamme does a masterful job here, especially at the end when he is interweaving images of the assassination attempt, the therapy session and the congressional Christmas party, all over the haunting Bach cello piece.

Whitford was dazzling here and won the Emmy for this (and one other season 2) episode. Arkin is brilliant here as the therapist. It's 2011 and I still miss this show!",1326672000,,1646,4.748251748251748

The HD downloads are only incrementally better than what can be achieved viewing a DVD, so I'll be waiting for a full Blu-ray release.

The West Wing is by far my all-time favorite series, so I'm itching for a full HD release, but this just doesn't cut it. The picture quality is just marginally better than DVD with a good quality decoder. Mind you, you need to know you've got a quality DVD player with vector adaptive deinterlacing, and a decent upscaler in your DVD player or TV to get to HD.

I use a HTPC, so I compared this episode amongst the Amazon download using the Unbox player; the DVD played in PowerDVD, Windows Media Center 7, and ArcSoft Total Media Theater 3; and a TiVo playing the Amazon download. In the HTPC, I have an ATI Radeon HD2600PRO that can handle the decoding, vector adaptive deinterlacing, and upscaling in hardware, if the playback software takes advantage.

The TiVo playback looked the best, but only marginally better than the DVD in TMT. The Amazon Unbox player doesn't seem to use the video driver's display preferences (brightness, contrast, etc), so I haven't been able to get a good picture using it. I preferred the DVD in TMT to the download in the Unbox player.

WMC uses a software decoder and deinterlacer, and the picture appeared soft and clearly inferior compared to the HD download. PowerDVD uses the hardware decoder, but either isn't capable of using, or didn't choose to use, the video card's vector adaptive deinterlacing. PowerDVD was also clearly inferior to TMT and the downloads.

I would rank the picture quality as follows:

1. TiVo playing Amazon download
2. TMT playing DVD
3. Unbox playing Amazon download
4. PowerDVD playing DVD
5. WMC playing DVD",1303948800,,1857,4.766355140186916
2003533,5,B0001HAGQK,"I generally agree with Newton Minow of the FCC who, in a speech to the National Broadcasters Ass'n. in 1961, said of television, ""You will observe a vast wasteland.""
In this year of 2011, I couldn't agree more.  Yet, every once in a very great while, there comes along a show which is really worth watching.  The West Wing (TWW) was such a show.  The members of the White House staff are portrayed as smart, energetic, and principled, which is of course at variance to government in general.  Jon Stewart once described The West Wing as ""Total ******* bull****.""  In a sense, he was right.  These characters aren't really true to life, particularly when it comes to the issue of integrity.  But we wish that's how our government operated. And that's why TWW was, for me, appointment television.

Noel has particular interest to me as a therapist.  It is well-written, the hallmark of Aaron Sorkin's work, with excellent character development.  The stages that the character Josh Lyman goes through with metamorphoses in his issue of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder are very true to life.  All of the symptoms he shows are textbook, and they were very well acted.  Add to that his reliving of his shooting with Yo Yo Ma's rendition of the first movement of Bach's 1st Cello Suite as a backdrop, made for a stunning presentation.",1297555200,4,1325,4.788546255506608
2003534,5,B0001HAGQK,"`The West Wing: Season Two' is an exceptional political TV series that follows a Democrat President and his senior staff as they make various decisions and run the U.S.A. This series follows on exactly from the cliff hanger that the first series ended on and the opening two episodes focus on the aftermath of the shooting. It then progresses to look at various events in the year of the administration, including the hiring of a republican lawyer to work in the White House, a Haitian election crisis, a Columbian crisis involving kidnapped American drug officers, an inspiring filibuster, post traumatic stress affecting staff after the shooting and the presidents own situation where he has MS and didn't tell anyone before he ran for election. In fact this last story dominates the second half of the series and makes for engrossing viewing as the ramifications, politically, legally and personally, become clearer. Like the first series this is very well written, with intelligence and humour and I love how the audience is respected to understand the political concepts with minimal explanation. This may be mildly biased and patriotic towards America (as you would expect from an American show), but it doesn't shy away from the more unsavoury aspects of American politics and this makes for quite a well rounded show overall. The standard here is easily as high as the first series and if you enjoyed that, then this won't disappoint.

2003537,5,B0001HAGQK,"For those of you who haven't had the pleasure, the West Wing was an Aaron Sorkin produced episodic drama that ran during the bulk of the Bush years. Or should I say, it ran as an antidote to the nightmare that was the Bush administration. The West Wing is a fantasy, but a beautifully realized fantasy. It's a picture of the American Democratic Republic as it should be, not as it was and, unfortunately, not as it, all too often, still is. The West Wing was a polemic on the Audacity of Hope. It's a demonstration of what happens when dedicated public servants work to overcome the intractability and, often, the pettiness that breeds in Washington. That pettiness, unfortunately, still holds sway in the offices of figures like Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, but it was a nice dream while it lasted. Season Two of The West Wing is, to my mind, the finest of the lot. It begins with an attempt on the President's life and it ends with that same President declaring his intention to run for re-election. In between are remarkable fictions like Shibboleth, about a group of Chinese Christians who cross the sea in a cargo trailor to escape religious prosecution, and The Stackhouse Filibuster, about an old man fighting a quixotic, impossible fight for justice because nobody else will. The seven years of this series were filled with gems, including a live Presidential debate between Alan Alda and Jimmy Smits in the closing season. That was something to behold. Magical as the series was, however, I don't think The West Wing was ever better than it was in its second season.",1280102400,,1580,4.728260869565218

With repeated viewings I've come to critique the writing and acting in a new way, but theres never a blatant let-down from episode to episode. Theres a handful of 'devices' in the writing that are used to convey the intelligence of the characters that gets repeated a lot.. and theres the over riding tendency of all the characters to, you know, use the same key phrase ('you know'.)

I thought to come here to see if others might have posted that they had the same problem, and I see indeed they did.  It is far far too long in time to expect Amazon to replace this season, but if the skipping is a known issue, it would be nice if they would.

I have the entire series on DVD and I cannot tell you how many times I've watched it. This series has massive replayability so it's worth the buy. It is also not ""dumbed down"" so they deal with a lot of hot-button topics and you can actually learn a little of how the government actually works and how cutthroat life is like in Washington, D.C.

The first few seasons and the last two seasons are the best. There are a good deal of special features and this season was amazing. It has a liberal bent so if you are conservative you may not like this show as much as someone who is more liberal.

2003576,5,B0001HAGQK,"I recently started watching the West Wing on DVD again after a long layoff. Season two is where they really hit their stride. From the suspenseful 2-part conclusion to season one's cliffhanger to the amazing finale where we say goodbye to a dear friend, Aaron Sorkin, Thomas Schlamme and crew fire on all cylinders with witty dialogue and great characters dealing with realistic issues and storylines that could have been ripped from the headlines (most must be loosely based on actual events).
The series is not afraid to have fun at the same time, like when Press Secretary CJ Cregg spends ""The Portland Trip"" wearing a Fighting Irish baseball hat because she dare make fun of President Bartlet's alma matter. Charlie spends most of the ""Shibboleth"" episode (directed by Laura Innes of ER fame) trying to pick out a knife for the President to carve his Thanksgiving turkey.
Aside from the superb regular and recurring cast there are guest stars galore from Adam Arkin to Marlee Matlin and so many more. I really enjoy Aaron Sorkin's work, including Sports Night and the West Wing - it's clever, smart and witty (three things that mean the same thing, but if you watch you will understand).",1214956800,,1191,4.8431372549019605

2003578,3,B0001HAGQK,"This is an EXCELLENT SERIES! Like others I absolutely recommend purchasing any of the series. However, I wanted to offer a warning.

I have all of the seasons. I received them all from Amazon (most were Christmas gifts).

4 of the sets had defective disks. There would be at least one episode that you could not play without it skipping. Please make sure you watch the episodes completely within the 30 return period to be sure that there are no defective disks. Amazon is very good about replacing the set if there are defects but there is a time limit. It is hard to get through 20+ hours of tv watching in 30 days!

Also- Sets 1-3 (and maybe 4) have programming on both sides of the disks. Seasons 1 & 2 are my favorites and have been watched many times. Over time the disks seem to ""split"" in the center and skipping occurs now throughout the programming. There are no scratches on the disks and the skipping is inconsistant (always happens on the disks now, but not always in the same place).

This issue does not seem to occur with the later sets (programming only on one side). There is no way to replace the disks once this starts happening. If you have a way to ""backup"" the first few sets I would recommend it if you plan to watch them often. Not an issue if you are only likely to watch them once.",1209427200,10,1308,4.326530612244898

He is amazing.  After Leo, he has the last word with the rest of the staff and is usually right, unless it's CJ, and she's usually right.  He rarely ever pulls rank with her, even though he's her boss.  I like that immensely.

2003596,5,B0001HAGQK,"I remember watching the finale to the First season, and thinking ""How are they going to top that?!!?"". Much to my amazement, they knocked it out of the ballpark with ""In the Shadow of Two Gunmen"". And then it was all uphill from there, right up until the final few magnificent moments of the season finale ""Two Cathedrals"".

What makes this series so creatively daring is Sorkin's injection of humor and whimsy. In 'Shibboleth', the CJ gets stuck with pardoning two turkeys which have taken up residence in her office. In 'Galileo Five', the President is reluctantly dragooned into attending a concert with the Finnish Symphony. Aren't TV series about the White House meant to be serious all the time? Obviously Aaron Sorkin and co. never got the memo.

The West Wing is a rarity on modern television. It is neither grim, nor gritty, nor postmodernist. It does not present a cynical view of the world, or revel in the 'bleak reality' of modern life. Instead, through its excellent writing and outstanding performances, it encourages us to actively and constructively engage with the world. For that alone, this series should be commended.",1189641600,,1138,4.921875

The characters are, as always, wonderfully drawn, and the dialog continues to be the strong point of the series.

This time around, the continuing characters include Emily Proctor (pre-CSI Miami) and the plots take a more conservative tilt at times. The episode where she is introduced is, in my opinion, one of the funniest in the whole series (people who think the show was serious didn't watch it very much: it's at times very very funny).

The acting is, as it was throughout the show, wonderful, and the characters are very well-drawn. I enjoyed the second season a great deal, and would recommend it.",1173744000,,820,4.85

I added these comments, however, because while some reviewers suggested this was the best season, there was no direct comment on what I thought was the single best episode of this single best season. I have watched a lot of television, and it is my opinion that the last episode of the season, ""Two Cathedrals"" is probably the best piece of drama ever on television. And the dramatic climax (next to the last scene) is written, acted, and produced (including the musical soundtrack accompanying it)at least as well as any scene from a feature film.

The two-part season premier is as good as it gets, giving flashbacks and providing how President Bartlett's team came together. I especially enjoyed the scenes between Sam and Josh and how the two of them happened to join Bartlett's campaign. The whole season is full of great plotlines and culminates near the end with Bartlett revealing he has MS. The season finale is one of the best I've seen, and the final scene with 'Brothers in Arms' playing in the background brings chills to anyone who watches this show. The West Wing is simply one of the best dramas ever made and this season is the best of them.",1150243200,2,759,4.547445255474453
2003608,5,B0001HAGQK,"A year or two ago, I watched the first season on dvd, and was amazed by the difference in quality from the first season to the last few.  When Aaron Sorkin was writing (the first four seasons) it was the best show in the history of TV.  In the final three seasons, it went from the best to being just a decent show.  There were still a few very bright spots in each season, but it was nowhere near the quality of the first four seasons.

I just started watching the second season and it was deja vu all over again.  I can't take my eyes off the screen when I'm watching these shows.  There are so many good lines in each episode that you can't help but appreciate it.

Normally, I'm not a huge fan of the commentaries and the other extras on dvds, but with this show I love them.  They give you so many interesting facts and stories about the show that it's worth the cost of the discs, just to get these extras.

If you didn't get hooked on the show from the beginning, do yourself a favor and buy the first four seasons on dvd.  If you like this show and haven't seen Sorkin's other show, go out and buy Sportsnight on dvd too.  The show was only around for two years, but it was one of the best shows ever.",1148515200,,1209,4.080508474576271

I recommend this second season or any other season highly. The direction, script, characters, acting, drama are absolutely stirring. Once you see a couple of these stories you may develop an inability to recall any other show or program that was nearly as good during your TV watching lifetime.

This is a story of our government and how our government should operate, with characters that have ideals instead of agendas, whom you can trust, and trust not to play dirty tricks. I wish everyone in the current West Wing could be made to watch this over and over again!

The episodes of hiring the young republican counsel, Mrs. Lanningham, and the treatment of PTSD are funny, dramatic, tragic, and powerful. This is not just a cut above American Idol or survival shows (which could whip The West Wing viewer into a hypnotic trance), it is a cut above the very best of the best in TV history.

You will watch these episodes over and over again. You will feel like you own a set of classics when you purchase this season or any other, and you will no longer feel the need to apologize to European viewers for our commercial interruptions.

2003624,5,B0001HAGQK,"The West Wing is a look at the operations of White House and current events from a Democratic point of view.  This season was filmed during the last year of the Clinton administration through the beginning of the Bush administration.  They tend to center around social issues and never criticize the actual administration.  They also have a tendency to bring up general issues from a political view that the general public never thinks of when they listen to the evening news. Now I am a die hard Reagan Republican and I have never taken offense with the show (I sometimes disagree with their stance but never thought that they were malicious.)

This is a generally brilliantly written and directed series.  The only complaint that I have is at times the writting gets a little smug.  The lines are a little too ""look at how smart I am.""  I think that they are trying to copy David Mamet's style of writing.  The only problem is that despite how brilliant Mamet is 22 episodes of Mamet will get on anyone's nerves.  I want to empisize that this is a minor flaw in a great season.

As we left season 1 of The West Wing, the President, his daughter and the White House staff were leaving a lecture when gunmen opened fire.

Season Two is presented on 4 double sided DVD's (Twenty two episodes on discs 1 -3 and extras on disc 4).  The following is (hopefully) a brief summary of each episode and extra:

Disc One Side A:

In the Shadow of Two Gunmen - The aftermath of the shooting.  The President and Josh have been shot.  This turns into a flashback on how the West Wing staff came together.  Anna Devere Smith makes her debut as the National Security Advisor.

In the Shadow of Two Gunmen Part 2 - The ground spotter is arrested and it is discovered that Charlie not the President was the target.  The flashbacks continue.

The Midterms - The midterm elections are impending and it looks like democrats might take back the House.  The staff is still recovering from the attack.  Sam fields a Congressional candidate only to have the candidate's past come to haunt him.  The President obsesses over an old candidate who is running for a local school board seat.  The best scene is at the end when the President uses the Bible to take down an ultra conservative talk show host.

In This White House - Sam appears on a political talk show and gets trounced by a Republican woman.  The President has her hired on staff.  An African leader (Zakes Mokae - one of South Africa's greatest actors) comes to the White House to discuss AIDS drugs for Africa and his country is overthrown.  Emily Proctor joins the cast.

Disc One Side B:

And It's Surely to Their Credit - Ainsley's first day is nothing to write home about.  The President has recovered from his wounds and is ready to be with Abby but can they find time?  A retiring General wants to public criticize the President.

Lame Duck Congress - The WW needs the Senate to ratify a test ban treaty.  But after looking at the new Senate make-up, they decide to look into a lame duck session.

The Portland Trip - Press junket on Air Force 1.  Josh discusses a ban on gay marriage with a gay senator who voted for it.  Leo deals with a ship with possible contraband oil.

Shibboleth - Thanksgiving is coming and CJ must pardon a turkey.  Chinese refugees arrive by container ship in San Diego.  Leo's sister is put up for appointment.

Disc Two Side A:

Galileo - The President has scheduled a video conference with 60,000 students for the Galileo Mars landing but NASA loses the signal.  Josh and Donna must choose a stamp (which comes down to a debate on Puerto Rico statehood.)  This was undoubtedly the episode that Alison Janney submitted for the Emmys as she is brilliant.

Noel - Josh is forced to see a trauma counselor (Adam Arkin).  The White House prepares for Christmas.  A fighter pilot breaks formation and crashes his jet.  A White House painting is discovered to be from Nazi plunder.

The Leadership Breakfast - The staff plan a bipartisan kickoff breakfast which becomes the first volley in the reelection.  Sam is sent on a reconciliatory dinner with a writer Leo accidentally insulted.

The Drop-In - The return of Lord John Marbury (Roger Reese).  The President is to address an environmental group.  CJ must ask a controversial comic to turn down an honor.

Disc 2 Side B:

Bartlett's Third State of the Union - This episode is what happens after the President gives the State of the Union.  Additionally, five DEA agents have been abducted.

The War at Home - The post State of the Union continues.  A mission to save the DEA agents turns out to be a trap. (Great performance by Stockard Channing)

Ellie - The Surgeon General makes a controversial comment about marijuana.  And First Daughter Eleanor (not Zoe) gets into the act.  The President is quoted about denouncing a film he's never heard of.

Featurette: Constructing Two Cathedrals - A 18 minute documentary on the episode with writer Aaron Sorkin and director Thomas Schlamme and production staff.  This is an interesting look at the making of a turning point episode.

Access Granted - This is a unique way of setting up the photo gallery by area.  You start with a blueprint of the White House and navigate to each room that has a photo gallery.  At the beginning there is a 15 minute documentary on the production design with designer Jon Hutman and producer Thomas Schlamme.  It's a good look at the actual production design for the series.

Gag Order - just over one minute of bloopers - fun but too short

Deleted Scenes - 10 minutes of 9 deleted or abridged scenes - The only problem is that there is no setup for these scenes, so we don't know why this was deleted or just abridged.",1135728000,12,7583,4.597159940209267
2003625,5,B0001HAGQK,"Season two of the West Wing is fantastic.  Each episode tackles political issues ranging from women's rights to a political leaders obligation to disclose a mental illness.  Although the show is more left leaning than right it does try hard to give both sides a voice.  The president hires a conservative lawyer to counter arguments made by the administration.  Ultimately, what I like best about the West Wing is it seems that the people are working to help the American people and not for special interest or themselves.",1135382400,,522,4.8977272727272725

2003632,5,B0001HAGQK,"With the benefit of retrospect over the past four years of the West Wing, years that have ranged from uneven to irrelevant to awful, it now becomes clear the show climaxed in season 2, a rousing, magnificently plotted, unforgettable season.  The first half of the season - that is, after the jaw dropping how'd-we-come-this-far two parter ""In The Shadow of Two Gunmen"" - is occupied by the weekly duties of the righteous - i.e. granting asylum here, falling satellites there.  That sort of thing could get tedious and self-aggrandizing easily, but with Sorkin writing at his fluid best, it makes for the stuff of compelling left wing fables.  That's true even when they include the right wing - the addition of Emily Proctor's spunky and endearing Ainsley Hayes is an inspired setup that, out of nowhere, brings into focus all the dreams and hopes of people that work in Washington.  Of course, the first half of the season is just there to get us complacent for the long narrative of the season - the unveiling of President Bartlett's run for a second term and the admission of his MS.  This plotline, stretched as it is, never lost dramatic momentum and had the rare ability to bring out the fiery best in every single cast member, from Toby's stirring discovery in ""17 People"" to Abby's ferocious and heartbreaking scream of ""We had a deal!"" in ""Bartlett's Third State of the Union.""  The build of this plot is so involving, that by the time it reaches its elegant and even understated conclusion in ""Two Cathedrals,"" we can scarcely remember ever seeing anything like it.  And, to put in my two cents for the best West Wing episode ever, may I cast a vote for ""The Fall's Gonna Kill You,"" an episode that, in barely trying, brings out the complex moral middleground of its great female characters CJ and Abby.  The moment CJ, with cold focus, finally answers the question ""Have you ever lied about the President's health"" feels like the foundational moment for arguably The West Wing's most memorable senior staff member.",1122854400,3,2025,4.765714285714286
2003633,5,B0001HAGQK,"Premiering in September 1999, the original NBC series West Wing built an instant cult following with its seemingly realistic weekly excursions into the inner sanctums of the White House. The series became such a hit that some pollsters claimed that certain people actually believed Jed Bartlet was the real president (although, if true, this is more of a negative reflection on the intelligence of the electorate, and not necessarily an indication of West Wing's realism). But regardless, the truth of the matter is that West Wing definitely strikes a chord with certain audiences, providing entertaining brew of action, suspense, and drama on a weekly basis...

Seasoned Hollywood actor Martin Sheen plays the lead role of President Jed Bartlet. The day-to-day affairs of Bartlet's administration are run by a number of individuals who surround him, among them are: Claudia ""C.J."" Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), Leo McGarry (John Spencer), and Charlie Young (Dule Hill). West Wing follows these dedicated staffers as they work extended hours behind-the-scenes to help keep the White House running smoothly. Along the way, the stress of the job and the characters' personal lives make for an interesting glimpse into what many believe is an accurate portrayal of a real-life White House administration...

The West Wing (Season 2) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the season premiere ""In the Shadow of Two Gunmen: Part 1"" in which the staff awaits news relating to the gunshot wounds suffered by Josh Lyman and President Bartlett, prompting them to reminisce about their initial involvement in Bartlet's campaign and how they all came to know each other. Meanwhile, Leo, Toby, and C.J. examine the formal inquiry into the Secret Service's policies as well as the legal implications of Bartlet's surgery and the transfer of his executive power... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""In This White House"" in which the White House staffers host a contingent of pharmaceutical executives and leaders from Africans nations in relation to ending the AIDS crisis, and ""The Leadership Breakfast"" in which the staffers participate in a bi-partisan breakfast which they hope will actually substantively tackle an issue...

2003644,5,B0001HAGQK,"Season 1 of the West Wing was a bit uneven at times, and lacked a season-arching continuity.  Season 2 does not suffer this problem, and so makes for enjoyable watching from end to end, with recurring plotlines stretching over the entire season and consistently high levels of quality in acting, directing, and screenplays.

So what is going on at the White House?  Well, it turns out that the President has multiple schlerosis, which could cause him to lose consciousness at unpredictable times.  This is obviously a problem for someone with the nuclear launch codes, but is early enough in the disease that it's not an acute problem.  Unfortunately, if the president intends to run for reelection, there's the issue of whether he maliciously covered up the fact that he has MS, and what the public should know when voting.  In fact, very few of the senior staff (only Leo, the VP, and a couple cabinet members) know, and as the others are let in on the secret, they do not take it well.  Toby takes it particularly badly, and some of the best shows (17 People, the Stackhouse Filibuster) focus on the relationship between Leo, Toby, and Bartlet.

Then there is the question of reelection - should the president, with his MS, actually run again?  If not, should he even finish his term?  What about getting his legislation through?  What about international crises like a military coup in Haiti?  What about the aftermath of the assassination attempt?  Will Leo gain any converts to the idea of ""Big Block of Cheese"" day?

Oddly enough, special mention must be made of both the (2-part) premier and the final show, which are flashback episodes.  ""In the Shadow of 2 Gunmen"" gives us flashbacks to the hype and excited optimism of Bartlet's winning of the Democratic nomination for president.  In a nifty contrast, ""Two Cathedrals"" at the end of the season provides a flashback even further back, when Jed was in high school and first debating politics with Mrs. Landingham, which helps shape his decision on whether to seek reelection.  Viewers who pay attention during the episode will be rewarded with the answer to the question ""Will you seek reelection,"" even though the show stops before Bartlet verbally answers.

So, pick up Season 2 of the West Wing for the best examples of the show's wit, relatively even-handed politics (Ainsley, the Republican lawyer, scores not a few points for the Right in a number of episodes), and fast-paced verbal action.  It well deserved the Emmy for best drama.  Unfortunately, there are precious few extras on this DVD package - don't be fooled by the box's list, they are quite short and deal entirely with the mechanics of the show.  Again, I have to ask, where are the extras on actual politics?  Why not do documentaries on the issues in the show?  Why not show us some of the ""extra material"" the producers supposedly make available to schools that use the show as a civics lesson?",1113782400,,2927,4.798403193612774
2003645,5,B0001HAGQK,"The West Wing pulls together all elements of great ""shows"" - writing, directing, acting, sets, costumes, lighting and music - in a way that always has me at rapt attention.

At the end of Season one the cliffhanger had gunmen raining a hail of bullets down on the President's entourage leaving a televised town meeting - the shooting and editing of that sequence was intentionally confusing and as season one faded to the final credits a voice cried out ""Who's been shot? Who's been shot?""

The 2-part opening of Season Two tells us who was shot, and the motivations of the shooters - and the scenes following the shooting are intercut with scenes from the beginning of the Bartlet campaign, back when Senator Hoynes had the nomination all sewed up and Jed Bartlet was only a liberal intellectual Governor from New England.  We get to see how Josh and Sam and Donna join the Cinderella campaign.  We get to see how Tobey goes from the guy who has overseen a half dozen losing campaigns to trusted advisor to the President.  We see C.J. go from press secretary for Hollywood's fattest egos to the job she was meant to have - as President Barlet's Press Secretary.

The writing has always come from a liberal/democrat perspective, but I think Aaron Sorkin and his team have also tried to show a balanced perspective.  Ainsley Hayes, a brilliant young Republican Lawyer, is first shown trouncing Sam on a Sunday morning talk show over education.  President Bartlet recognizes her intelligence and fire and has Leo ask her to become a White House lawyer - which provides more opportunities for ""opposing viewpoints"".

The season progresses in a realistic manner, and although I've been a Republican my entire voting life - going back to Reagan's first election against President Carter - I only hope and pray that the men and women who are actually running my country are doing it with as much intelligence and compassion as the fictional Democrats of ""The West Wing"".

2003646,5,B0001HAGQK,"The day my family finished season one, we ran out and bought season two. This season has one of my favorite episodes of all time in it, Noel. I can remeber seeing that episode on tv when i was about eleven. Even then it took my breath away. That episode has some of the best editing I've ever seen. It is a work of editing art. ""In the Shadow of 2 gunmen parts one and two"" are also two of the best episodes all season. I highly recommend this Dvd.

2003647,5,B0001HAGQK,"First of all, I'm a political science/history major and I'll still be the first to admit that I was a bit sceptical of this series.  I just didn't think that they could make this show as interesting, informative, and especially funny as it ended up being.  After watching about the first disk of the series, I was hooked and it had become my favorite show.  The first season just blew my mind.  I've now watched the rest of them, and they haven't let up a bit.

This is anything but watching an hour of Capital Hill voting on CNN, though.  There's an incredible cast including Bradley Whitford, Allison Janney, Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe who take you into the show and the world of politics.  It's nowhere near stuffy; full of humor, love interests, and interesting information.  From the first frame of the episode, you'll be glued to the TV.  If you're interested in politics, or even if you're not, give this series a chance.  You won't be sorry you did.

I would strongly recommend against buying this on DVD until there is another DVD printing available from the distributor.",1107648000,9,440,4.653846153846154
2003650,5,B0001HAGQK,"Has there ever been a season of television quite like season two of ""The West Wing""? The cast and crew--masters of their crafts to start--hit their peaks here, striking a virtually perfect balance of drama and comedy, from the pulse-pounding energy of the two-part season opener, ""In The Shadow Of Two Gunmen,"" straight through to the sheer power of ""Two Cathedrals."" Those two, along with ""Noel"" and ""17 People,"" are easily at the top of the short list of best-ever ""West Wing"" episodes, and ""Two Cathedrals"" may very well be one of the best hours of television, ever, period.

""17 People,"" I'd argue, is really the quintessential ""West Wing"" episode. It's certainly all you need to know about Aaron Sorkin's talents as a writer: on the one hand you have the emotional gravitas of the President revealing his M.S. to a staff member (Toby) while assessing a national security threat; on the other hand you have the rest of the gang trying to ""find the funny"" in a boring speech. And yet the lasting emotional sting comes from the Josh and Donna storyline, in the form of some of Sorkin's greatest rapid-fire dialogue.

Favorite moments from the second season...

--The revelation, in the teaser of ""In The Shadow Of Two Gunmen (Part I),"" of the fallout from the first season's cliffhanger

--Bartlet presenting Charlie with a gift in ""Shibboleth""

--Yo-Yo Ma in the climactic scene of ""Noel""

--Josh and Sam attempting to start a fireplace in ""The Leadership Breakfast""

--Meeting Oliver Platt in ""Bad Moon Rising""

--The superb marriage of song and theater at the end of ""Two Cathedrals""

9/11--which happened between the second and third seasons--had a strange effect on this show, in that while other forms of entertainment became escapes for us, the fictional world of ""The West Wing"" suddenly felt hopelessly pass. Which is to say, I think that the levity and optimism of the first two seasons renders them a cut above even the later seasons of this show. And to watch them over and over again is to enjoy unique and unparalleled television.",1104883200,,2046,4.85632183908046
2003651,4,B0001HAGQK,"Aaron Sorkin is a genius and it shows in each and every episode.  That said, the special features on this DVD set are pathetic.  The few commentaries are banal and the gag reel is a whopping three minutes long.",1094947200,,210,4.358974358974359

2003653,5,B0001HAGQK,"I first purchsed season one with skeptical thoughts spinning through my head like, ""It's a TV show, how good could it possibly be?""  Well, it was a very impressive first time around looking more like an extended film with a phenomenal cast growing into their characters with some splendid writing and interesting stories.  While by the end of the first season the plotting was becoming a little repetitious with a main story involving the entire cast and a sub-plot usually about one of the characters on a personal level.  In the second season most of this predictability is thrown out the window, the cast is expanded to include some great guest acting, the acting and writing are much sharper, and the classiest of all moves is that the show is now being shot in Widescreen.  But I do have a question: What happened to Moira Kelly?  She is absent from the entire second season with no apparent explanation for her absence.  Also, during the first season it was fairly frequent that sub-characters were discarded for four or five episodes at a time and I was left wondering just where those characters have gone.  In the second season, just when I began to wonder when I would see a certain character again, the actor would promptly return to the West Wing to let me know they haven't gone away.  In other words, none of the sub-characters are ever discarded or forgotten, giving the show a transfusion of energy and newness just when it needs it.  This exceptional cast has finally gelled and completely embraced their characters with depth of emotion and nuance of characterization.  The second season has the show in full flight.  Don't miss out on the Air-show!",1093564800,6,1667,4.753472222222222
2003664,5,B0001HAGQK,"The second season, is absolutley wonderful, probably my absolute favorite of the 5 seasons that presently exist. Seasons 2 and 3 are, in my opinion, the peak of what Sorkin has given us. Especially now that John Wells has really taken over.

 But this season goes beyond any expectation you could have for a show giving you sincere drama and Grade A acting that really pulls you into the story.
 There are a few episodes in this season that would make it worth the money alone, which i list below.

 In the shadow of two gunmen - pt. 1 & 2 - A great two part episode, detailing the previous choas of the shootings and incorperating flashbacks of the senior staff. Definetly not something to be overlooked.

 Noel- My absolute favorite episode of the season. Being forced to see a therapist,you gradually see how Joshs' trauma is affecting him more and more. It really shows a great detail of the complexity and metally unsettled he is underneath his placade surface. You're being brought inside the persons mind and feeling what he is going through. He doesn't find the therapy nessecary and throught the session he continually resists with witty remarks agasint Stan, the therapist. He doesn't like the idea that someone he doesn't know is delving into a disturbing part of himself that he wants to stay away from. Compelling music and cinematography bring the episode to a climax when Josh and Stanley are going over what happend at the Yo-Yo ma concert. Incredibly moving episode.

 The Stackhouse Fillibuster- A lighter episode, still containing great entertaining qualities. CJ, Josh and Sam all write emails to their fathers in the time of the fillibuster, and the scences gracefully move in and out of action and the self-narrative characteristics of the emails.

 Ellie- Dealing both on a personal and professional note, this episode entails the relationship of the President and one of his daughters, after her comments on the Surgeon Generals position in politics.

 18th and Potomac - This episode begins with the tensions of a planned admission to the public that the President has MS. Leaves you hanging a tad when you learn that the Presidents seceratary and long-time friend has been killed in a car accident by a drunk driver.

 Two Cathedrals - If 18th and Potomac left any sort of wanting, Two Cathedrals more than makes up for it in so many ways. The White House Staff awaits the presidents desicion of wether he will be running again or not. Things come to an apparent low when it seems that he might not run.

 The funeral that proceeds most of the episode is very touching, moving and disturbing at the same time. One of the more powerful scenes in the season occur when the President stands alone in the Cathedral, denouncing God as a thug, exclaiming in Latin - ""Am I really to believe that these are the acts of a loving God? A just God? A wise God? To hell with your punishments. I was your servant here on Earth. And I spread your word and I did your work. To hell with your punishments. To hell with you.""

 The entire episode, Pesident Bartlet has flashbacks of his teen life, from when his relationship with his secratary first started off.

 Things get darkest before dawn towards the end of the Episode, where a distraught Bartlet calls for his dead secratary, and realizes she isn't coming. When suddenly he she walks through the door and ""consoles"" Jed on what he is going through.

 There are little things in this episode that you absolutley have to pay attention to if you want to get the full affect. If you pay attention, you don't have to wait untill Season 3 to know what his answer is to wether or not he is running for a second term.

 Overall, the best drama i've ever watched. Stunning and remarkable achievments in television, and well worth buying. You don't have to interested in politics to love this show, even though i think it helps.

 It's shows like this that reaffirm your belief that there is still quality programming out there, don't let this season of remarkable episodes evade you.",1091404800,14,4041,4.695035460992908

His angry monologue to God is something I don't think will every be repeated on a television drama. The chemistry between Donna and Josh is just so well played out. I never get tired of watching my DVDs of Season 1 & 2. It was a true mistake on NBC's part to let Aaron Sorkin leave as head writer. Season 5 demonstrated that the show is not the same without him. The network has commented that the rating have slipped compared to prior seasons.

I have read on TV guide.com that season 6 may be the last season for The West Wing. This show has brought so much acclaim to the network and it wrong for the network to treat the fans and actors this way. How many emmys has the show won ? The West Wing has much life left in it only if the writing returns to the qualitly of seasons 1 & 2. This show should not be allowed to go out on a low note.

For political junkies, it is Manna from Heaven. Aaron Sorkin is a dedicated Democrat, as is the star's show, Martin Sheen. It is a show that attempts to make Democrats look like idealistic, well meaning, courageous, 24/7 workaholics. These people do exist, but in light of the recent death of Ronald Reagan and the new Bill Clinton book, it is instructive to recall that this show, along with ""The American President"", was an attempt to disuade the public from the realities of the Clinton Presidency. If the Democrats were all like the ones shown in ""The West Wing"", they would get 90 percent of the vote.
Th show does try to stay balanced on occasion, but a comparison between President Bartlett and his wife and Bill and Hillary Clinton provides a dose of reality that is not of help to Clinton apologists.

2003671,5,B0001HAGQK,"Words cannot express the sheer euphoria that one feel after watching the season finale ""Two Cathedrals"". It was drama at its finest, pure unadulterated form. Heck, I would become a US citizen if it had a president and senior white house staff as what Bartlet got. It shows what we aspire our politicians to be, what we hope they would turn out to be, in the annals of power.
Aaron Sorkin has conjured up an array of characters and their stories which defy description and blows away every other show on TV. I have never loved a series such as this, Seinfeld and CSI comes close but still nowhere near The West Wing.
Once again, you don't have to be an american to enjoy what this series has to offer. It would help to understand the political scenario a bit, but you just need to be capable of enjoying a good drama. And once in a while if you forget its all fiction and actually begin waiting for the day for people with integrity and character to serve you from the West Wing, then get out there and vote them in to power.",1087689600,2,1024,4.310880829015544
2003672,5,B0001HAGQK,"OK, so its hopelessly idealistic president leans left of center.  And the score often resembles that of an afterschool special.  Look beyond it, because ""West Wing"" is simply great television.
What made this show, and set it vastly apart from the rest of network television, from the first shot of the pilot was the peerless writing.  The always witty dialogue, at equal moments sarcastic and sincere, comedic and tragic, delivered at breakneck pace is a sheer delight.
I've long felt this show to be the best comedy on TV.  The moments of humor are deep, biting, and uncontrived; in other words, completely unlike any so-called ""comedy"" program.  ""And It's Surely to Their Credit"" is a brilliant episode:  Great humor, great drama.  I laughed more often during this episode than in two entire seasons of ""Friends.""
Others have listed the 22 episodes. All are above average; most are excellent.  Season Two has more polish than Season One; less of a liberal infomercial-feel than Season Three or Four (though Three and Four's allusions to Bush are entertaining.)  This is the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the finest program network television has offered in the last decade.",1087084800,2,1180,5.041237113402062
2003673,5,B0001HAGQK,i really love  the west wing so much it is so wonderful to watch i have been hocked on the west wing since 1999 i love the actors all of them,1086739200,,141,3.5483870967741935
2003674,4,B0001HAGQK,"This box set is great. I have been a fan of the west wing since the pilot episode, and watch every episode on NBC and the Reruns on Bravo. I ordered and recieved my copy of the season 2 box set on release day, and have watched the episodes again and again.
Only complaint is that the screen goes ""funky"" during the title sequence, where it is boxed into a small square on the screen. I think this may be because the entire set is in a 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen in laymans terms)  This problem corrects once the episode starts, though..
Other than that, though, this is a great set. every episode, from in the shadow of two gunmen, to Two Cathedrals, is absolutly gripping.
I would recommend (to save on the shipping) that you buy the first season WITH the second season if you don't own it already, because you will want to buy it right away.",1086652800,2,846,4.320754716981132
2003675,5,B0001HAGQK,"You simply don't get things this good very often. The show itself is unmatched with exceptional writing, acting, directing, and even the more unappreciated things like lighting and editing are superb! This DVD has everything that someone that loves this show would expect. A must buy for any serious DVD collector or lover of this show.",1086307200,,336,5.017857142857143
2003676,5,B0001HAGQK,"After viewing this season's DVD set numerous times, I'm convinced that it represents not only the best season in terms of the WW series, but also some of the finest television today. Starting off with a bang (no pun intended), we see the roots of the Bartlet campaign as Josh Lyman holds on for his life following the VA shootings that ended season 1. As the characters slowly recover from the traumatic experience, the series shifts to President Bartlet's MS and his bid to run for reelection. You get the feeling that Aaron Sorkin picked up on some of the criticisms of last season's so-called grandstanding and soapbox sermonizing, as he delved deep into the personalities of each of the cast members to show a kind of pain and longing that binds them together through thick and thin, this time through standing behind Jed as he admits to the country that he lied about his health. The season (along with Season 3's two-part opener ""Manchester"") takes a swooping bow into the reelection year with the kind of heart and vigor that's rarely seen by movies nowadays.
The highlights are a plenty throughout the magnificent season, peaking with the focus pieces on each staff member: Sam's father in ""Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going To Jail"", Josh's post-traumatic stress disorder in the emmy-winning ""Noel"", Toby's ethical battles and toe-to-toe face off with POTUS in my personal favorite, ""17 People"", and a look into Jed's past with what has to be one of the most sublime and superbly acted episodes in the season finale ""Two Cathedrals"".
We get a gentler and smoother hand guiding us this season, a contrast to last season's desperation leading up to the semi-forced ""Let Bartlet Be Bartlet"" that finally brought the gang ready to play. In season 2, you see a more serious and deeper exploration of above all things, a surrogate family struggling to survive and depending on eachother as things get tougher, leading up to Jed's announcement for reelection, done with such great skill that you want to cheer, you want to cry, you want more.....which is a shame, since Season 3 just can't compare to the first two...
Especially this one.",1086220800,3,2154,4.871934604904633
2003677,5,B0001HAGQK,"Before I get to my review, I just want to say that this talk of widescreen not working for the credits is mistaken.  The reason why is that the second season of the show was originally filmed in widescreen, but it was shown, at least in the US, in fullscreen.  Therefore when they made the masters of the credits and the ""previouslies,"" they were done in fullscreen.  Later, in order to match them with the widescreen shows on the DVDs the fullscreen credits are ""boxed"" with black bands on either sides.  You may or may not like the effect, but it's not a mistake, and the widescreen does work, if you watch the actual show.
Now, to get to my actual review, the second season of ""The West Wing"" is simply some of the best television ever made.  If you can only own one season, this is the one to get.  The season is bookended by some of the best episodes of the entire series, with gems such as ""Shibboleth,"" ""Noel,"" and ""Somebody's Going to Emergency..."" in between.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll learn, but most of all these episodes are just a delight to watch again and again.  ""The West Wing"" has the perfect blend of comedy and drama that is so rare in TV today.  The picture and sound on this DVD set are just gorgeous.  In short, I can promise you won't regret this purchase.",1085875200,4,1288,4.373949579831932
2003678,4,B0001HAGQK,"I was disapointed with the commenteries on the season openers ""In the Shadow of two gunmen"". They added nothing to the story. I was hoping it would be more in depth with the story. It was more like having the guys over and made little chit-chat.
The commentary on ""Noel"" was a lot better. It told the story behind the story.",1085443200,2,324,4.327868852459017
2003679,5,B0001HAGQK,"I have recently re-discovered this show with season 1 and 2 on DVD.  The show is fast paced and has many stories and situations in every episode.  In that respect, it is much like ""E.R."", another great show on DVD.  What I like about this show is that, while it often goes into serious and deep discussions about social and political issues, the writers are smart enough not to bog it down in constant heavy drama.  Something funny will always happen or an off the cuff remark from one of the main characters.  I lost interest in this show after Rob Lowe left and I do think that is when the show 'jumped the shark' but what do I know...I haven't seen this show much beyond the first 2 seasons.  Great show, great acting, great writing & thought provoking.  What more do you need to make you buy this DVD? Highly recomended",1085097600,4,823,4.375
2003680,5,B0001HAGQK,"While I may not be an experienced critic, I like to think I'm capable of distinguishing the good shows on TV from the, well, not so good shows. Put simply, The West Wing is an amazing television show which provides for a viewing experience unparalleled. As I say in my title, this is television at its finest. Without trying to sound too corny, the West Wing allows for escape--to a place larger than life (so much for not sounding too corny). To me that's what entertainment is all about though. And that's why I recommend The West Wing wholeheartedly to all of you reading this review. I don't just recommend it because the acting is amazing, though it is. Nor do I recommend it because the direction and production of the show displays such polish (It does). Even still, I don't recommend it because the writing is, at times, truly inspiring; trust me it is.  I recommend it because the amazing acting, the polished direction/production, and the inspired writing all mesh together to provide for a show that is above all entertaining at its core. With that said, go buy West Wing. You won't regret it.",1085097600,3,1104,4.63265306122449
2003681,5,B0001HAGQK,"As a self-professed ""Wing Nut"", I was beside myself when I got the first season on DVD for Christmas. To know that I can now get Season 2 is the best news!! Seasons 2 and 3 are, in my opinion, the best. Especially ""Debate Camp"", ""Game On"", and ""Election Night"". Those are where Bartlet's moxy comes out! I actually already have every episode on tape (thanks to Bravo), but the DVD is obviously much better with the special features, commentaries, and lack of commercials! This is a must-have!",1084924800,2,492,4.6022727272727275
2003682,5,B0001HAGQK,"This is one of the best shows that television has ever come up with.  It gives one a feel for what it is really like in the White House.  I'm glad they picked a democrat to be president.
Martin Sheen is one of the best actors of all time. (West Wing fans may be frightened, though, when they see Sheen's peformance in Stephen King's ""The Dead Zone.""
Watch ""The West Wing"" and you become addicted, but it is a positive addiction!

2003683,5,B0001HAGQK,"If you're looking at this, then you obviously have season 1 and you know that this is the best television show of all-time.  It sounds cliche, but you will laugh and cry in the same episodes.  I always yearn for more when the black screen comes up at the end because the story lines are so interesting and the characters are so endearing.  I consider myself a borderline republican and I still love this show.  Most of the political issues are background to character development and the way the characters deal with those problems.  Don't be frightened off if you are not a liberal; this show is for everyone.
P.S.  Season 5 is not ""The West Wing"".  It is a show WITHOUT Aaron Sorkin and without any real merits.  If that is you're only experience with TWW, then please check out Season 1 or 2.  The first 4 seasons are incredible.  My favorite is 4, but we all have to wait for that.",1083283200,7,885,4.374233128834356

8012878,2,B0001HAGQK,"Years ago I bought the West Wing box set from Amazon.  A while later I realized some of the discs were missing. I emailed the publisher and they replaced them. I had watched the whole thing a few times but the discs weren't over used and were kept in the case. First just one disc wouldnt play, then before I knew it several were defective, from each season. They would get stuck sometimes before the main menu.  They weren't scratched, it looked like something in the middle was wrong. I love this show but cant afford to just buy a whole other set all at once. I saw the seasons were pretty cheap so Im trying to get one at a time so that I can actually watch ALL the episodes. This replacement season is fine but Im not happy that so many discs need replaced in the first place. Dont know if its an Amazon thing or who ever made those box sets. Some seasons are all of a sudden not through prime. Id better be able to replace the rest cheaply!",1494720000,2,946,4.163934426229508
