1957889,4,B0000WN0NM,We live in Asia and my daughter got exposure to Franklin through books and when my grandmother sent me Franklin - Homemade Cookies we watched it all the time and I felt it was time for another. This video is equally loveable and actually has more stories on it that we had previously read together as a family. My daughter loves it.,1168646400,,332,4.370967741935484
1957890,4,B0000WN0NM,Our two year old son LOVES Franklin and this was the perfect video for our flight to Maui.,1125878400,2,90,4.055555555555555
1957891,1,B0000WN0NM,"I once read that this DVD gets defective, and it's true.  Our boys watched this a couple of times and all of a sudden it started repeating and skipping.  I think it's a manufacturer's defect, but it makes it sooooo annoying.  It's not good quality.",1125360000,8,248,4.466666666666667
1957892,1,B0000WN0NM,"NEVER GET THIS DVD FOR YOUR CHILD! MINE HATED IT!!!!!!  THE DVD BROKE IN HALF IN THE MACHINE!!!!!!!  THE BOTTOM WAS ALL SCRATCHED!!! (BY THE WAY,THE REASON MY NAME IS FRANLOON IS BECAUSE MY CHILD PUT IT LIKE THAT!!!!)",1111881600,,217,4.538461538461538
1957893,5,B0000WN0NM,"My 3 year old loves this video.  It is eight episodes on one DVD - great!!!  It is annoying how they won't let you skip through the previews and I have to get out the remote to fast forward through them.  Other than that, I would highly recommend this video.",1102636800,14,258,4.12
1957894,3,B0000WN0NM,"This first-ever DVD release of ""Franklin"" television stories includes a nice range of stories from the first through third seasons of the show. Included is the very first story, ""Franklin Plays the Game,"" as well as other great stories like ""Franklin's Camp Out"" (in which Franklin learns about doing things for himself) and ""Franklin's Birthday Party"" (in which he and his Dad come up with a creative solution to entertain his extravagant birthday plans.)
There's nothing to complain about as far as the story selection goes, but the DVD also promises exciting special features. However, when I went to take a look at them, it turns out that these so-called special features are actually an exact duplicate of what was included on the ""Back to School With Franklin"" DVD, right down to the song from it. They're nice and all, but I've seen them before.
Also, each time you pop the DVD in, a promo track for other DVDs and such starts up. It does let you fast-forward it, but it won't let you skip it, which tends to grate a bit. On the positive side, the problem with the captions that existed on the ""Back to School With Franklin"" DVD has been fixed. On that DVD, the captions had a problem in which they tended to extend off the edge of the screen, and they were also riddled with punctuation errors. On this DVD, captions for longer lines are split into two rows, so that they don't extend off the screen. (Note that rather than the traditional caption format, these captions look more like subtitles, with larger text and no black background.)",1086048000,36,1547,4.670329670329671
1957895,5,B0000WN0NM,This is a great collection of stories for toddlers/ young children. It's clean and cute.,1243900800,,88,4.933333333333334
1957896,4,B0000WN0NM,"Franklin is a favorite at our house and this DVD, with its eight episodes, is a nice addition. It's nice to have so many episodes on one DVD and they play continuously without end credits which is a nice feature for my child. However, a big negative is that when the DVD is initially loaded, we are forced to sit through ALL the previews which takes about five minutes. While a message states that one should be able to get to the menu to skip the previews, at least on my player this is not possible. I haven't had this problem with other DVDs so it may be unique to this disc.",1239494400,,578,4.169642857142857
1957897,5,B0000WN0NM,"I was happy to find the Franklin DVD. I looked in Walla Walla and was unable to find. My granddaughter fell in love with the Franklin turtle books at Christmas. She likes watching videos, so I thought this would be a great gift for her. She opened package and we had to watch immediatly. It was an instant hit. Thanks for having the video.",1237420800,,339,4.3125
1957898,4,B0000WN0NM,We put this dvd on for him to help him fall asleep. He love this show so he would giggle all night if we let him.,1217548800,,113,3.3846153846153846
1957899,5,B0000WN0NM,"Very good, lovely, and interesting stories for kids to learn English from.
Amazon's service is also good and reliable. It replaces the shipment immediately which was lost by the post office.",1207353600,,190,5.161290322580645
1957900,5,B0000WN0NM,I bought this DVD for my 2 year old granddaughter.  She loves it.  Her mom says she has to watch it every morning before going to the nursery.  She has learned different behavior lessons from this DVD.  I've watched it with her and I actually enjoyed it myself.  I recommend it for any child.,1200182400,,292,4.333333333333333
1957901,5,B0000WN0NM,The Franklin books and dvd's are great for kids.  They are wholesome fun for children.,1199577600,,86,4.733333333333333
1957902,5,B0000WN0NM,"My grandson age 2 1/2 Loves Franklin so needless to say this was his favorite when we played it for him on Christmas day.  One of the series is not being played anymore on TV so it was a great treat for him.
Grandma does it again",1199059200,2,229,3.872340425531915
1957903,5,B0000WN0NM,"This is the perfect gift for any child. My daughter loves Franklin and so do I. Unlike most cartoons for children that I can not stand to watch because they are so irritating, I enjoy watching Franklin with my child. A must have for anyone with a young one.",1184976000,3,257,4.26530612244898
1957904,5,B0000WN0NM,"The Franklin stories are wonderful for 3-6-year-olds. I live in Switzerland, where we don't get shows like this very often, and I find the lessons heartwarming and valuable. Franklin's perspective is always realistic for a child, and more importantly, easy for kids to identify with. The Blanket episode perfectly fits my 3-year-old, and the story about learning to ride a bike actually inspired my cautious 5-year-old to go back out on his own bike and try again. I'm disappointed to see the low ratings based on such things as a possible defect in a particular DVD, rather than the content of the shows themselves. I highly recommend this DVD.",1170979200,7,645,4.926605504587156
