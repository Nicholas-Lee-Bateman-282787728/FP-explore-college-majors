8168701,5,B000MGAXXG,I let my students see the alcohol and all. Of course I tell them for adults only and to use responsibly. I don't see any reason to sheiks them from this. They see it in tv and in the culture at large.,1491868800,,200,3.7857142857142856

8168705,5,B000MGAXXG,"I loved the Mexico City episode- but all of these on the main disc were quite good.  Be careful if you plan to show these to classes if you are a teacher- there are a few scenes that reference/focus on alcohol- but there are many many other worthwhile scenes, including on the bonus disc- especially the market and food parts.  PREVIEW FIRST- unless you want to have your students watch the travelers taking tequila shots!",1417651200,3,422,4.613333333333333
8168706,2,B000MGAXXG,I am a middle school Spanish teacher and have used a lot of Globe Trecker films.  This one would be five stars if it were not for the part on Acapulco.  It is just sleezy.  I could not use that part.  The guide shows himself runing while wearing a speedo.  It is absolutley vulgar.  Then he says one of the major reasons for coming to Acapulco is for sex!!!  Then dancers that look like strippers get a few seconds of air time.  I could not use it for my classes.,1400716800,,463,4.066666666666666
8168707,5,B000MGAXXG,"The Southern Mexico episode could have been much better if the host had gone to Oaxaca and done more cultural things.  The Baja California and Copper Canyon episode is fascinatingly surreal with beautiful scenery and cultural aspects.  The Mexico City episode is probably the best of the three.  And the Globe Trekker extras on the bonus disc are also quite entertaining, especially the one on Mexico's food.  For the latter two aspects, ""Globe Trekker: Ultimate Mexico"" is worth the buy and a better choice over ""Globe Trekker: Destination Mexico.""

However, BE WARNED: As mentioned by other reviewers, the Globe Trekker series is not designed to show you how to travel as a tourist who barely gets to know the culture in which they find themselves.  Instead, it is a series with a very backpacker-type oriented bent aimed to entertain rather than show you the best hotels and beaches.  Great music, as well.  5 stars.",1385164800,5,919,4.922077922077922

8168709,5,B000MGAXXG,"Although some reviews indicate that this DVD shows the extreme side of a trip to Mexico (including old busses, questionable hotels, etc.), these videos have a great mix of tourist attractions and culture. If you want to understand more about the country than just nice hotels and premium beaches, this is a great DVD",1196208000,11,316,4.87037037037037
8168710,1,B000MGAXXG,"A friend and I are preparing for a trip to Mexico and I purchased this DVD thinking it would provide video footage and appealing ( educational and quirky?) insight into Mexico. The film footage was from the 3rd Century - edited in without attempting to change the dated color or create some semblance of context. Ian Wright spent most of his time lying on the side of the road waiting for ""fun"" - as if, we too were going to relish his hitch hike to hell. I would love to say that there was an element of camp - or anything worthy of passing this DVD on to fellow travelers, but it was poorly written, filmed, edited, and way too much money for such a lifeless production! Next time I will definitely pass on Globe Trekker DVD's as a source of inspiration for travel.",1192752000,10,767,4.333333333333333
