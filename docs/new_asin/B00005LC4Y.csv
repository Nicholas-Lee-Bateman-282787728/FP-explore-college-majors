1620757,2,B00005LC4Y,This film is a low budget skin flick.  I will not say that it is low quality and I certainly can not say it is high quality. The actors are good looking and the script is average at best.  I ordered it thinking it was a different film.  It is not one I would recommend.,1323648000,,269,3.8545454545454545
1620758,1,B00005LC4Y,"""The Arena"" revolves around 2 points: (1) a pyschopathic Roman governor in the northern Barbarian hinterlands who is obsessed with gladiator battles, and (2) two absolutely beautiful but talentless former Playboy Playmates who play slave girls molded into female gladiators.  That about sums it up.  The movie really brings home that depravity of the Roman empire and the complete and total lack of value of human life in that era.  For that reason, it's worth watching once.  The violence is graphic perhaps by necessity, given the subject matter, but it seems that the subject matter was chosen to showcase the violence for a target audience.  The movie appears to have been filmed in a Slavic language and overdubbed in English (except for the Playmates, who speak in their native English).  Don't buy this movie for the Playmates.",1120521600,2,834,5.0510948905109485
1620759,2,B00005LC4Y,"This film isn't exactly what I expected. It wasn't nearly as trashy and gratuitous as I expected ( which is a shame ), but it is reasonably well filmed and some of the acting isn't all that terrible. The Arena offers a fairly historically credible depiction of  a military outpost in Roman Britain. The costumes are quite good, and although I find it heavy handed, there is an attempt to utilize a cinema-graphic atmosphere. This film certainly does not resemble a cheap made for TV film. The two female leads ( former Playboy Playmates ) look great, whether naked or not. That doesn't hurt, but there is considerably less nudity than one would anticipate. What a shame....

Oddly enough, I think that the film's higher than expected quality to be it's downfall. It's neither fish nor fowl. However, if you're a fan of this genre, you would certainly want to add this flic to your collection.",1103414400,7,892,4.711538461538462
1620760,2,B00005LC4Y,"Here is a film that obviously tried to ride the coattails and cash in on the enormous success of Ridley Scott's magnificent GLADIATOR.  Try as it might, however, at the end of the day it's still a low-budget, badly put together, half-baked movie.
The highlight of the film is that it stars two playmates:  Lisa Dergan and Karen McDougal.  While there is some gratuitous nudity, it is brief and not nearly as erotic as it could have been.  However, as you probably imagine, both girls are lookers and have exquisite bodies (especially McDougal).
Beyond that, there is not a whole lot that is redeemable about this film.  The script is absolutely horrid and the acting is not much better.  Dergan has some decent facial expressions that could pass for acting, but everyone in the film looks like they're reading off of cue cards.  Some of the scenes are so silly that I swear they came straight from Monty Python.
The story also fudges history a great deal.  As indicated in the film, Rome was sacked in 410CE.  However, I can assure you that gladiatorial games had nothing whatsoever to do with the impetus of this incident.
Rather, the real story was that the Visigoths were trying to escape from the Huns in the late 4th century.  The Huns were sweeping westward and invaded the territory of the Visigoths.  So, the Germanic tribe requested to come under the umbrella of the Roman empire for protection from the Huns.
The Visigoths were betrayed by the Romans and tens of thousands of them starved due to Roman empty promises.  This led to furious resentment and ultimately a rebellion that overwhelmed the resources of Rome.
In the end, the Germans sacked Rome in 410, as is stated in the film.  However, Rome did recover from being overrun and it was not officially ""over"" for the western half of the empire until 473CE.  People who watch this DVD need to be aware that the story seriously fudges this so that history may cater to Corman's plot.
To be fair, there was one subtle aspect of the film that had undeniable historical veracity.  In the final sequence, Dergan wears gladiator mesh that extends down her right arm.  This was normal fare for gladiators as it protected their sword arm.
The Romans wanted the contests to last awhile, and one of the best ways of doing that was ensuring that the gladiator had maximum protection on the arm which held their sword.  Otherwise, if the fighter lost the faculty of his sword he could do little to defend himself / herself (the Romans considered this to be very boring).
However, the filmmakers hardly went overboard in their familiarity with the games.  While the trident / net was a common feature in the games, they would be apt to go up against fighters who had extensive armor. The point was to pit opposites together:  one with light armor but a long reach vs. the other with lots of armor but a much shorter reach.
Also, one of the gladiators in the film has a shield that's about as big as a dinner plate.  I'm pretty sure that was not normal fare in the gladiator arsenal!
When I purchased this film I figured I would be getting a poor man's GLADIATOR, and that's pretty much what I got.  While there really were female gladiators in the Roman empire, I would think that any women who looked like Dergan or McDougal would have been spared the arena.  Unless you have an insatiable curiousity about this movie, I would recommend that you spare yourself from ARENA as well.",1079222400,8,3434,4.622734761120263
1620761,4,B00005LC4Y,"I purchased this film on DVD even though I had read bad reviews of it, I was very surprised! I had none of the audio, nor visual problems, and had a very crisp and clear picture. I even tested it on a high definition TV, with outstanding clarity. I have never seen the original version shot in the 70's, but I intend to. First, Karen McDougal and Lisa Dergan both give fine performances for first time acting stints. the cinematography was well executed, and the film well paced, along with other fine acting of the foreign actors. The McDougal/ Dergan  commentary/ interview is very nice and insiteful. Version reviewed is presented in widescreen format.
  I disagree with the other reviewer's view on the nudity, it was not gratutitous, nor degrading, and fell in line with the story. Yes, there is some nudity, but to give a negative review just because there is not ENOUGH nudity is too harsh.
  I give a thumbs up for ""The Arena"", and highly recommend this film for those who enjoyed ""Amazon's and Gladiator's"" a superior film of the same time period. Amazon.com ships very quickly, and safely, with excellent pricing!",1063238400,6,1123,4.7384615384615385

1620763,1,B00005LC4Y,"Sure, the only reason I bought this movie was because my favorite Playmate/PMOY is in it.  I wasn't expecting much, just something worth seeing.  So, is there anything worth seeing in this film?  Simply put, no.  The acting is terrible, the costumes are cheap, but there is mindless nudity from both of the featured playmates.  I hate to say it, but Ms. Mcdougal can't act to save her life.  Sure she was great in her playboy video, but she didn't do anything other than prance around naked. I only paid $12, so it didn't hurt me in the ol' pocket.  I bought this one to add to my growing collection of Mcdougal merch, and that would be the only reason to own this one.  Don't even bother renting it, it's not worth the money.",994723200,8,726,4.365671641791045
