5004897,5,B006MIVX8W,"Having watched and enjoyed the whole ride on this movie I can't say I get the other reviews posted. This movie is obviously intended to be a B movie and having watched the other Asylum films such as Dino Croc vs Super Gator this literally flies over the head of them all. The story line is entertaining and the action sequences are well filmed and produced. Special affects & actors and fun and enjoyable to watch. If you're looking for some serious drama I would suggest looking at Liz Adam's others shorts that will literally leave you shaking in your boots. Lighten up people, this is great to watch & giggle. I'm glad I've purchased.",1336435200,3,637,4.547826086956522
5004898,1,B006MIVX8W,Its a sick planet when you can have millions of people starving in the world and millions can be spent making a movie like this.  If I gave my baby sister a 1980's VHS recorder and sent her into the backyard I don't think she could have done much worse!!!,1335744000,,255,4.1
5004899,1,B006MIVX8W,"Let me say right up front, I llooovvvveee ""Disaster"" flicks. Being a nurse who has worked
at a Level I Trauma Center that sees the 'worst of the worst' of human injuries & illnesses, and having been through many disasters of my own, working in war-torn countries, surviving a major earthquake to having to make an emergency landing in Tokyo when we were re-routed by a cyclone & a few other disasters in between, our family enjoys these shows immensely. Even the ""B"" movies we love to laugh & take apart the mistakes. But, ""Air Collision"" is beyond a ""B"" movie. Is it possible to go down to""Z""? The best part of the movie is the first 30 seconds (NO Spoilers given), then it goes downhill from there.

I wasn't sure whether to give this DVD a 1+ rating for being the worst film ever, or a 5+ for being the worst film ever! It was a hard call. For those who may not be aware, there really is a ""Rotten Tomato"" Award Ceremony, a spoof of the Academy Awards for the WORST film of the year. Sandra Bullock won both an Academy Award for ""Blind Side"" & a ""Rotten Tomato"" Award for ""All About Steve"" in the same year. But, I digress. This film should truly win a ""Rotten Tomato"" Award for 2012. Let's just say, none of the actors should give up their day jobs waitressing, valet parking, etc.

To say this had moments of being ""politically incorrect"" is putting it politely. This will insult every pilot, air traffic controller, flight attendant, and, well, humans who may suffer through its 90 minutes of content. Just how many pilots would be the FIRST off the plane before the passengers if it were finally able to land back on terra firma?! I could name 2, but I don't want to take any suspense away from seeing if anyone survives ""Air Collision""! When you're not holding your breath from wondering what will happen next (every pun intended), to falling asleep from sheer boredom, then this is the film for you.  But, don't say I didn't warn you, when you look back on your Life & wonder ""what happened?"", this film will be the first to come to mind of what a 'wasted Life' you led, by having spent even a moment watching it. I did it for you (you can hold your applause until the end, for the sacrifice I made to all), so you don't have to.

If this film had humor in it, it could be another ""Airplane"", but, we the viewers are not that lucky. I was hoping the ""Special Features"" would have some redeeming qualities. Nope. With the Director/Writer smiling at the camera & saying, ""I hope you enjoy the movie"", I just wanted to take her hand & lead her off the plane...that big step all the way down.

Remember...you were warned.",1335484800,3,2626,4.395061728395062
5004900,1,B006MIVX8W,"This show has a good plot, but it is very low budget. I can only say it is watchable ! It was the normal cost for a new release, but the cost should have been half that.",1333756800,2,169,3.5945945945945947
5004901,1,B006MIVX8W,"I was more than upset with myself for making this puchase and in blu-ray no less!  This ""film"" is a ghastly excuse for entertainment.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1333324800,3,159,4.448275862068965
5004902,1,B006MIVX8W,"One star is too many. I love action movies, especially anything involving airplanes & ATC. The acting is terrible! The film must not have bother with a technical adviser or just ignored them (I am a retired controller and a pilot). Very little resembles the truth in this movie, and you must have a little to make it seem watchable. If I didn't get to watch it for free, I would have spent too much. But I did waste my time, hope you don't make the same mistake.",1333324800,3,462,4.261363636363637

Feeling,It's time to end this review,One last cast to hold up,Gerald Webb,'Damn Man',Finally a leading role,You get to grow as a character and get the girl...IN THIS FILM ?",1333152000,,929,4.974025974025974
5004904,1,B006MIVX8W,The trailer makes this movie look good. The first 30 seconds of the movie will show you that the movie is absurd. I've seen some low budget stuff but this is the worst I have ever seen.,1333065600,2,185,4.027027027027027

5004906,4,B006MIVX8W,"In disaster movies there some ""im"" laws that are suspended, namely those of improbability, implausability,and impossibility. Granted those suspensions I found this a solid piece of work. Invoking Murphy's Law, yes, everything that could go wrong did. There were lots of bang for the buck. Wasn't the hero Air Traffic Controller the dude Steve Erkel used to drive nuts? Not bad at all for a low budget movie.",1516665600,,407,5.0

5004909,3,B006MIVX8W,There are SOOOO many things wrong with this that it's almost a comedy. I think if they had gone in that direction it would have been much better.,1515369600,,145,4.214285714285714
5004910,5,B006MIVX8W,"Glad I didn't let the poor reviews stop me from watching. Great for a ""B"" movie and I could watch again. Plenty of excitement. Of course there are more people on Air Force One than seven! Give it a chance and watch, you just might like it, just keep in mind it's not a blockbuster.",1515110400,,281,4.127272727272727
5004911,1,B006MIVX8W,It started out ok but then the sound didn't match their lips. So it made it really hard to watch. Other wise it had great action and a lot of great diaster. I'm glad I didn't pay for this movie.,1511740800,,194,3.875
5004912,1,B006MIVX8W,Do not waste your money on this movie. Very slow and actors looks they were making the dialogue as they go,1496102400,,106,4.095238095238095

5004915,2,B006MIVX8W,"The government has built a super-computer controlled satellite system which controls all plane movements. The system has just been switched on and one of the first planes to take off is Air Force 1 (an obvious choice.....). There is an explosion on one of the satellites which causes a cascade failure of the system, resulting in a loss of control of the planes. The result is two planes on a collision course, Air Force 1 and a commercial jet.

The premise of this film is obviously ridiculous but the filmmakers don't seem to realise or care and just keep making the idea more and more ludicrous. The planes can't be properly controlled by anything other than the system, communications are all routed through the failing system, everyone running the airports is incompetent except one controller and his apprentice. The list goes on and on. Yes, I understand this is an Asylum film and they churn out cheap films like this all the time, but this one is worse than their usual efforts in the story department. Not that any department gets a good rating - the acting is truly awful, particularly the load of actors and extras in the planes who sway violently in their seats and put on silly faces. The script is horrible, sounding ad-libbed much of the time. The casting is terrible also - the US president is the most unlikely character you can imagine as president.

The film is around 90 minutes long and it is absolutely frenetic but somehow it still manages to be dull and feels far too long. The Asylum are playing their regular game of thinking that playing lots of urgent-sounding music and having people running around aimlessly, screaming, constitutes good pacing and makes for an interesting story.

OK, so what is good about this film? The blu-ray is a lovely glossy digital production that the Asylum actually do remarkably well. And the sound, while only a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 affair is easily able to handle the subject material

There's really not much to like about this film. If you buy it, good luck.",1483228800,3,2024,4.7252124645892355
5004916,4,B006MIVX8W,"You could tell it was a B type movie, but it was still interesting to watch and pretty good actors in it. We're keeping this.  The seller sent this overnight; fast service, good quality DVD.",1469404800,,190,4.428571428571429
5004917,3,B006MIVX8W,So-so movie and doesn't get to the collision until near the end of the movie.,1463443200,,77,4.2

5004919,5,B006MIVX8W,"I loved this movie. Granted this will NEVER be equal to Strategic Air Command,  Crowded Sky, or any of the multitude of other movies. Even Air Force One was better and more realistic. But this is classic Sci-Fi channel. I don't know for a fact, I have no proof, but I could swear this was made for Sci-Fi channel, if not it has the look and feel of one of their movies.

I am getting off the point. I liked Air Collision. It was exciting, but realism was lacking, except for management dismissing the controller's warning that something bad is going to happen.",1445644800,,560,4.427184466019417
5004920,3,B006MIVX8W,"The movie was a bit campy, but was entertaining on a good rainy Saturday afternoon.  However, it does make you stop and think for a second can this really happen???",1440806400,,164,4.466666666666667

5004922,3,B006MIVX8W,"Air Collision keeps you on the edge of your seat more than you'd first anticipate.  I thought all the storylines for air disaster movies had been used up, but I was wrong.  I recognized the plots of several previous storylines thrown together and it worked out surprisingly well.",1438300800,,279,4.791666666666667
5004923,1,B006MIVX8W,"Clearly, one of the worst movies ever made. I'm torn between giving it one star because it's so awful, or five stars because it was so horrifically awful that I was engrossed with it, waiting to see if it kept getting worse... and it did. Seriously, the writing was so bad, the acting so wooden, the special effects so cheesy, that I found myself sucked into the vortex of completing it.  I could feel my IQ dropping by the minute. Spoiler alert: Reginald Veljohnson survives. I actually liked that part.",1427587200,2,504,4.6
5004924,1,B006MIVX8W,Just another example of actors are desperate to get any job out there no matter how bad the project. It sickens me to see how many good actors fall into this catagory. I guess if it puts bread on the table.........,1427587200,,214,4.2439024390243905

5004927,1,B006MIVX8W,"I often find myself on a lonely friday night, watching c rated syfy originals whilst commenting on their poorly constructed CGIs and actor choices. Rarely does a movie give me such feelings of detest and loathing such as this film. this movie made me want to hurt people. this movie gave me suicidal thoughts it was so bad. I could have made this movie in my back yard with a paper plane, an iPhone and some string and it would have been more respectable than this abhorrent piece of cinema.",1389312000,5,491,4.466666666666667
5004928,3,B006MIVX8W,The show was ok lots of action. I think you love it if you love model airplane you will this movie.,1388102400,2,99,3.761904761904762

5004932,1,B006MIVX8W,"Too many faults with the movie to list. The military rank was all wrong, a Captain in the army is not called Colonel and the ""Colonel"" was much too young to have ever reached that rank. Normally when a T-tail aircraft bumps it's tail against the bottom of another aircraft moving at high speed, the tail falls off. Glad I only paid $2.00 for the movie, it was incredibly awful.",1354838400,,377,4.4
5004933,4,B006MIVX8W,"I'm glad I don't listen to people's opinions on films or I would have missed out on this good film. From the beginning to the end this film was exciting. The story was feasible, and really made you think about letting machines take over humans on jobs. The acting was not that bad like some people claimed and the action scenes were good. It was not a high bugeted film, but some money was used in the making of this film. I would say give this movie a shot.",1352332800,,458,4.157303370786517

Leslie Nielsen where were you.  Would have been a great Leslie Nielsen comedy. Still chuckling.",1526256000,,359,4.5625

The premise, effects, cinematography and acting are all garbage, and it adds up into this beautiful little dumpster fire that I greatly enjoyed watching.  The hilariously overblown deaths of some of the passengers had me laughing out loud, but the best part by far is near the end.  ""Ambulances"" pull up to the downed plane that are obviously just cut out of a video, and there is a large amount of the original background all around them from the sloppy editing.

The best/worst part was the missile hitting the plane and landing in the aisle but not exploding, or doing cpr on a guy who was still awake and breathing (initially), or all the fake screaming when passengers had oxygen masks on.  Everything those planes hit should have torn them to pieces.  I don't think air traffic controllers would say ""two-forty"", they would say ""two-four-zero"".  I've never seen so many inaccuracies in one movie before.",1518739200,,611,4.672897196261682

Air Force missile hits commercial plane, people throw missile out the hole and destroys bldg., hole is plugged by baggage ( that is a good one), lots a fake screaming (really fake).

From cheesy sets, poor dialog, improbable physics to some really bad acting, this has all the makings of an amateur film. The script writers obviously did little to no research in writing this movie. Cleveland is not located near any mountains, and an airliner's wing would never survive gouging a building or demolishing a signal tower with out causing the whole plane to cartwheel out of control and break up. Only because i was too tired to turn the movie off and too amazed that anyone made this movie expecting  to make money did I watch it to the end.
