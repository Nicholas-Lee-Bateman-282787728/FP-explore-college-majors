8148831,4,B000J3EBG2,"Each of these movies is an excellent example of Mr. Infante's breadth of talent.  Like any great actor, he had the ability to play everything from serious drama to very appealing comedy.  Add to that, his excellent voice, and one can understand why he was such a legend amongst several generations of latin americans.

Most of the videos are shot from projected film, and some cases, the remaining prints must be badly deteriorated.  I don't so much blame that on the DVD production studios, as the fact that these films have not been well preserved.  They could use a film preservation and restoration effort as has been done with so many American Classics.",1363392000,,658,4.787610619469026

8148834,5,B000J3EBG2,"""Tizoc""

One doesn't usually associate director Ismael Rodriguez with Technicolor and CinemaScope, rather with the earlier b&w Pedro Infante films like ""Nosotros los Pobres,"" and ""Los Tres Garcia,"" but this film has brilliant color, spectacular scenic vistas, and is gorgeous to look at, and one wishes it would be released in widescreen to fully appreciate the beauty of its Oaxacan landscape and the many historic landmarks. ""Tizoc"" is also special because it stars the two most renown actors of the Epoca de Oro of Mexican filmmaking, Pedro Infante and Maria Felix. Infante plays Tizoc, a humble but noble native of royal bloodlines, hated by the rest of the Mixteca villagers because he is not from the same tribe, and despised by the white man because of being ""indio."" When Tizoc first sees Maria, the headstrong, artist daughter of a landowner, he thinks she is the Virgen Maria, and then when Maria, ignorant of a local custom, gives him her handkerchief to wipe some blood from an injury, he falls hopelessly in love with her. Maria is engaged to handsome Capitan Arturo (Eduardo Fajardo), and trying to sort out the confusions and errors of many is Fray Bernardo (Andres Soler, excellent as the ""Padrecito"").

A lot of the dialogue is in a semi-dialect but is understandable, and the film has a certain stiffness to it, but nevertheless it has loads of charm, and is endearing due to Tizoc's sweet soul and his ability to converse with animals, which makes him poetic and intuitive. Maria Felix as always looks like a goddess, and her presence fills the screen like few superstars have managed to do. With the exception of one short scene which alternates betwen being a little too dark and a little too light, the film is in very good condition. Alex Phillips did the glorious cinematography, Raul Lavista the interesting score, where birdsongs are the main focus of the soundtrack, and ""Tizoc"" won a Golden Globe Award in 1958 for Best Foreign Language Film, as well as many other awards, like a Golden Ariel for Ismael Rodriguez, and a Silver Award for Best Actor at the 1957 Berlin International Festival, given to Infante posthumously. Pedro Infante (1917-1957) crashed his plane near Merida in the Yucutan, and 50 years after his passing, still reigns supreme in the hearts of millions.

""Los Gavilanes""

Of the many Pedro Infante films I've seen (which is practically all of them), ""Los Gavilanes"" for my taste has the most beautiful songs. 2 of them are huapangos written by Jose Alfredo Jimenez, and are sung with exquisite tenderness by Infante: ""Ruega por Nosotros,"" and my all time favorite ""Cuando Sale la Luna."" The settings for them are also wonderful, as the film has excellent Epoca de Oro cinematography by Agustin Jimenez using a lot of soundstage sets. The other songwriter for this film is Ruben Fuentes, and there are many memorable musical moments.

The complex plot is centered on a mother's dark secret, and the class struggles between the poor workers and the tyrannical leading landowner, who rules with an iron fist (and has the army on his side). When the son of the landowner attacks Infante's girl and she kills herself rather than submit, he becomes a ""Robin Hood"" type of rebel, with a gang who call themselves ""Los Gavilanes."" There are a lot of action scenes with stupendous horses, and one can always admire Infante's amazing horsemanship, and he looks very dashing in his black Gavilan outfit.

Other reasons to cherish this film is the cast, which includes Lilia Prado, Ana Bertha Lepe, Hortensia Santovea as the mother, Infante's brother Angel as the rich man's son (there's a plot clue there!). Most of all, there is a delightful performance by Angelica Maria, about 10 years old at the time, and it's a lovely remembrance of this most beloved star as a child actress.

""Los Gavilanes"" was the only film director Vicente Orona did with Infante, and it is a special one. Very entertaining, quite moving at times, and worth it for the music alone, especially ""Ruega por Nosotros"" and ""Cuando Sale la Luna.""

""Cuidado con el Amor""

This romantic comedy has a confused but amusing plot, and a marvelous cast. The story is about Salvador (Pedro Infante), who when he leaves his father's ranch for the big city, is given 2 letters of introduction to his father's old friends. Played by Oscar Pulido and the inimitable Eulalio ""El Piporro"" Gonzalez, the 2 friends turn out to be a couple of hard drinking gamblers, and give Salvador some lessons in life and make him less of a greenhorn. Enter gorgeous schoolteacher Elsa Aguirre, who captures Infante's heart and plays very hard to get. There are funny scenes as the 3 guys dig for treasure in Elsa's house, and lots of fine music, to make this an entertaining entry from the Epoca de Oro of Mexican cinema, with lovely cinematography by Raul Martinez Solares.

Written and directed by Miguel Zacarias, ""Cuidado con el Amor"" is one of 7 films he made with Infante, and though not the best of their work together (""Ansiedad"" would take that prize for me), it's an enjoyable film for Infante fans. The songs are all sung by Infante except for ""Corrido de Agustin Jaime"" which is sung by El Piporro and Ochoa. No subtitles are available.
Songs: ""Ifigeo El Sombrerudo"" (written by Severo Miron), ""Corrido de Agustin Jaime"" (dominio publico), ""Cien Aos"" (Ruben Fuentes), ""Serenata Huasteca"" (Jose Alfredo Jimenez), and ""Si Tu Me Quisieras"" (Alberto Cervantes).
I have yet to see ""El Mil Amores,"" and am looking forward to it! One can never have too much of Infante.",1214784000,12,5554,4.861522198731501
