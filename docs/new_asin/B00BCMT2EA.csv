5578402,5,B00BCMT2EA,This documentary produced by National Geographic highlights the important historical events of World War II from 1939 to 1945. Most of the documentary is combat footage from the European and Pacific theaters of the war. It does an outstanding job of the intensity of combat and how the Allies were able to stop the evil empires of NAZI Germany and Imperial Japan and Facist Italy. With millions of casualties World War II was the biggest and most destructive war in history and after watching this DVD I can understand how intense it was over the six years it was fought.,1376352000,,571,4.72
5578403,5,B00BCMT2EA,Excellent source of history. The stories told by actual soldiers in the field gives the film authenticity. I enjoyed it!,1375401600,3,120,5.05
5578404,2,B00BCMT2EA,"World War II is hardly a subject that can be adequately covered in a single DVD so my expectations weren't terribly high for this offering. The conflict is flashed over so quickly that anyone with even a passing interest in the war will find nothing new here. There were some video clips that were new but even many of those were oddly colorized for some reason. (Luftwaffe aircraft insignia colorized red for example...why??).

An example of the ""inside"" history...the story of Stalingrad consisted of the Germans got close, the weather got cold, soldiers froze, the Russians won the battle. There are much better choices out there for WW2 history. I took a chance on this video as National Geographic usually delivers an excellent viewing experience. Not in this case in my opinion.",1374624000,4,784,4.9393939393939394
5578405,5,B00BCMT2EA,My husband collects true World War 11 material and he enjoyed this one as it had some different information that his other 100 or so movies and documentaries didn't have.  Karen Mentzer,1374105600,3,185,4.78125
5578406,5,B00BCMT2EA,I am so interested in WW2. Watching this makes it so much better to know what really happened in WW2. My grandpa served in Germany and its too bad he passed away I never gotten the chance to ask him what he experienced everyday. Call me crazy but I wish I could've lived through that era.,1373155200,2,288,4.160714285714286
5578407,5,B00BCMT2EA,"These actual combat films bring home the true reality of armed combat.  There isn't  anything glamorous about it, it's kill or be killed by your'e enemy.  There were certainly acts of great bravery performed during WW11, but most of the actions were performed by ordinary frightened men, who were ordered to do a job.  These men suffered greatly during this conflict, many came totally changed, never to be the same men who left to fight the war.  THese films are important, because they show our history, be it good or bad.  I think it is important to preserve these films for future generations, so they understand this era in our history.  The authors did a fine job in putting this dvd together.  I would recommend it to students of WW11.  JRV",1372982400,14,747,4.641221374045801
5578408,5,B00BCMT2EA,"I taped this on NatGeo and watched it twice. Once by myself and again with my mother who was born during the war years. I thought I knew quite a bit about World War II, but nothing to this extent. This program features the war from beginning to end in chronological order, following each battle as it happened, switching from the German front, to the Allied Forces, to the Japanese. I appreciated that because it really gave me a good idea of what really happened.

The program is very graphic. I sometimes had to look away and some of the things they tell you (many veterans and survivors speak in this film) made me sick. However, it should make you sick, all of it. It should also make your proud of the soldiers who fought to win this war (and not just the USA, but all of the Allied Forces). I feel that if the USA had entered the war sooner, it would have ended sooner, but we'll never know.

All the images and footage are real, no re-enactments. The veterans are brutally honest and often graphic. The pictures don't hide anything, literally. There is only a smart part on the Holocaust, which is fine, as there are many, many documentaries and books just on that subject alone. I have been to the Holocaust Museum in D.C. and I learned a lot there, so I knew going into this documentary what that was all about. However, for anyone just learning, I think a little more information could have been provided about the Holocaust. However, if you've been through Junior High, you've read Anne Frank's Diary and have a general idea of what that was all about.

This doesn't include everything, I think it would take a lot longer than 3 hours to do so. However, if you have at least a basic knowledge of WWII history, it covers enough. It does not however cover the various smaller attacks on Australia, which surprised me. That was after all part of the war, why was it not included?

Either way, I'll be adding this to my collection and hope to find more documentaries as good as this one to build upon all the information garnered from this documentary. I've seen many informative documentaries about Hitler and the Holocaust on NatGeo, so keep an eye out for them if you want something more centered just on Germany/Hitler or on the horrors of the Holocaust. There are also a lot of books on both subjects that go into great detail. This is a basic overall look at how the war played out.",1371600000,30,2395,4.461187214611872
5578409,5,B00BCMT2EA,"Just finished watching this show on NatGeo channel. What a great documentary. To me WWI in Color and this documentary are the two best videos on both wars. This is similar to WWI in Color in that it uses living veterans (many of whom are mentioned in Band of Brothers) to tell their story. I really like the way this film is organized. Easy to follow and the maps and explanations show how massive this war was. I have read many, many books on WWII and seen countless videos - this one ranks as one of the bests. It is long but too me, not long enough. Very touching, dramatic, surreal and horrible at the same time. I am putting this video on my wishlist hoping that one day I will get it for Father's Day, Christmas or any celebration (or if I can scrape up the bucks, which, by the way, is a really good price). All the major battle are covered but this film does not get bogged down with military strategy with hard-to-understand maps with arrows. There are some but they work with the film. There is a lot in this documentary that I have not seen or heard before. One interesting tidbit is that when Allied forces were in England it was an enlisted person who figured a way to attach a device on the front of a tank to plow through the hedgerows (they called it a rhino). Highly recommend this documentary.",1370908800,16,1311,4.3117408906882595
5578410,5,B00BCMT2EA,"Just caught this on National Geographic channel, and immediately hopped onto Amazon to look it up. Of course, I can't speak for the DVD quality (as it hasn't been released yet), but as for the content this is a well-done start-to-finish encapsulation of a very complex and eventful (and IMPORTANT!) war. It includes lots of footage, presents the major events chronologically and in a realistic manner (i.e., no PC spinning/weighting). For those newly discovering WWII, the enormity of the war and what winning and losing would've meant for America and the future of the world is well-represented and portrayed. Included are many tales told by (strikingly modest) war heroes, lots of sadness and loss, conflicting emotions, and difficult decisions amidst the horrors of war, culminating in the sheer elation having been victorious over tyrants and maniacal regimes bent on ruling the world. Unlike many documentaries that cover a specific battle or player in the war, there are very few, if any, dull moments in ""Inside WWII"". Being relatively short and concise, this would make a great introduction to a really important milestone in American history for high school students. I've pre-ordered the DVD to have for my kids when they reach the appropriate viewing age. Highly recommended.",1370131200,10,1286,5.217391304347826
5578441,5,B00BCMT2EA,"I'm a big WWII buff and it shows some footage I have never seen. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in WWII or in history
in general. Have to warn people it has some graphic footage!!! My father fought in WWII so that makes this DVD even more special.",1455494400,,262,4.26
5578442,3,B00BCMT2EA,Not the best summary of WW II history.  Tends a bit toward PC.,1453852800,,62,3.769230769230769
5578443,5,B00BCMT2EA,This DVD is awesome. Lots of great videography about WWII. My Uncle loved this. I was pleased to receive this on time and packaged safely. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves history.,1448841600,,201,4.611111111111111

5578447,5,B00BCMT2EA,We should never forget WWII.  Nowadays the youth is too busy playing with their toys and really not understanding what occurred in our past that could again arise.  Let's hope we never have another world war.,1421712000,2,208,4.75

5578464,2,B00BCMT2EA,Good but I've seen much of this in other films. Really it's just a film for beginners who don't know much of WW2,1396569600,2,112,3.9130434782608696
5578465,3,B00BCMT2EA,"Good primary source interviews for the men who fought in the war is the one saving grace for this series.
The story is told from the US viewpoint, which is fine with me since Im a US history teacher.  But then who is the audience for this show?  Its not a very good introduction to the war.  Series like Ken Burns The War and WWII in HD do a much better, albeit longer, job of describing and explaining the war.  Two hours is just not enough time to do a chronological version, at least with stock footage, narration and some interviews.  This should have had more big ideas and themes rather than a list of what happened.
The transition effects and extra footage after-effects were weird.  There was a mix of color, B&W, and colorized B&W, almost all of which Ive seen before.  Thats fine but couldn't they have used the footage more effectively?  The footage was so chopped up with no more than five seconds for any one shot and sometimes as little as 90 seconds on a topic/event. While the war claimed the lives of 60 million people there as a huge over-emphasis on showing dead bodies, death and carnage.
Throughout there was very little to no context and few homefront scenes.  The narration was sufficient but lacked bigger ideas and context.  There was no real context for Holocaust just, you guessed it, a lot of dead bodies and there was little more for the A-Bomb.
Despite the intro claiming to talk about why we fight the program does little to build on themes or ideals and just seems to be interested in showing the body count.  Have you ever heard someone say that war is boring?  Programs like this are the reasons.",1389139200,,1630,4.488135593220339
5578466,2,B00BCMT2EA,"This is like a mountain dew commercial approach to an important historical event.  I did like some of the accounts from the soldiers, however this documentary is very fast paced and very narrow in scope and perspective.  America fought a bunch of bad guys and won.  Well, ok, that might be how to explain it if you're speaking to very young children.  Anyone who paid attention in high school history class won't learn anything new.  This is a topic that should be treated with respect, not whisked through like a commercial.",1380067200,2,525,4.725274725274725
5578467,5,B00BCMT2EA,This is a nice chronologically order explanation of WWII fun for both enthusiasts as well as someone who could use a cliff note version of the war.  Great and entertaining.,1377820800,,172,4.733333333333333
5578468,3,B00BCMT2EA,"There is nothing in this DVD that hasn't been seen before. It is way to short. They try to give you a 5 year history in 2 hours. Save your money. There are much better DVDs out there e.g. BBC History of WWII, WWII in HD, The World At War (11 volumes). The World at War is without doubt the single best history of WWII. Forget Inside WWII, there are many others out there which are much better.",1377302400,8,393,4.051282051282051
5578469,5,B00BCMT2EA,My husband loved it.  The interviews with the survivors and real footage were so interesting.

8566183,1,B00BCMT2EA,"""Shocking may be the best single adjective to use for this abomination, because it contains twenty part of shock for every one part of useful information. But the overthetop, insensitive exploitation of images of carnage is not my primary complaint.

My primary complaint is that this program possesses nearly zero educational value. Enormously important historical events are covered in one or two sentences with zero context. The supremely important subject of the rise of Nazism, for instance, is given a mere superficial gloss which fails to even comment on the conditions that contributed to the rise of the horror of Nazism. Nor is there anything approaching an intelligent discussion of such major events as the German annexation of Austria or the green-lighting of Germanys incursion into the Czech Sudetenland at the Munich conference of 1938. As for the GermanSoviet nonaggression pact, the narration ludicrously states that Germany and the Soviet Union joined forces, implying a military partnership. In fact the pact was a matter of convenience between two enemies who knew they would eventually fight each other.

Instead of thoughtful, informationbased narratives, we are given rapid cuts in music video style with pounding background music meant to shock. Kids should not see this, nor anyone who has been a kid.

I bought this because of my faith in the Nat Geo brand. Their America Before Columbus, for instance, is an outstanding historical documentary. However, this dreck has cut into my trust of the brand. Ill be far more circumspect before clicking Buy on a Nat Geo history doc next time.",1460332800,4,1611,5.188461538461539
