8234170,5,B000YV20ZS,"This movie used great story lines, detail to the actions leading to the story of 4 different women, and a funny while unique twist to the frogs you kiss while finding your prince. I would recommend to those who are dating and unsure what they're looking for as the one woman is clear on being rooted in Christ and not prejudging one before you get to know them. I'd love to see more work from Trinity, Bud'da and Pastor Cole (Titus Pollard).",1362960000,,441,4.390243902439025
8234171,1,B000YV20ZS,"The movie starts with a bathroom scene of a couple having sex which was a bit offsetting. As the movie progressed things got worse the same scene was played back over and over. The acting was horrible and there was no cohesive flow to the story- line, the point of the film was danced around, but was not clearly defined and expressed which left the audience frustrated and disappointed. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS FILM.",1276560000,3,420,4.613333333333333

What a wonderful movie. I've also read Purposefully Made by I. Fountaine Allen and it is a print for of the movie.",1204675200,,266,8.851851851851851
8234173,5,B000YV20ZS,"I must say that Trinity, Bud'da and Kevin did an excellent job on this movie. Thanks, Jean Claude, for the opportunity to act (as Pastor Cole) in what was my movie debut!

I look forward to more films by the duo of Trinity and Bud'da!
