8053442,4,B0007XIW3C,"Jerusalem with Bill and Gloria Gaither and the Homecoming friends is an unforgettable live concert filmed at the Tower of David Museum - David's Citadel in Jerusalem.

Cherished stories from the life of Christ take on a new significance as the Homecoming friends visit the places where Christ lived, ministered, was crucified, and buried. Imagine the excitement of visiting the empty tomb - knowing that He has risen.

The concert opened strong with the Hopper Family singing ""Jerusalem"" and Guy Penrod featured with an arrangement of ""Resurrection."" The Mighty Ones of Israel"" gave a local feeling of the music of Israel. Sung by Bekki Smith with Anthony Burger playing the accordion and a group of dancers featured in the background

Memorable musical numbers that linger with me include:

* I Walked Today Where Jesus Walked featuring Larnelle Harris
* El Shaddi featuring Janet Paschal
* Peace Be Still with the Homecoming Friends - Filmed on the Sea of Galilee
* Holy Ground sung by Joy Gardner
* Then He Bowed His Head and Died featuring Larry Ford
* It Is Well With My Soul featuring Guy Penrod and David Phelps
* He is Jehovah with Ernie Haase  and Signature Sounds

Background scenes with descriptive narrations by several from the cast included the Mount of Olives, the Mount of Beatitudes, the Garden of Gethsemane and many more.

This is a Homecoming celebration we will watch often to enjoy the music, the worship experience, and the warmth and inspiration if the participants. A meaningful, enjoyable evening.",1306972800,,1523,4.97244094488189
