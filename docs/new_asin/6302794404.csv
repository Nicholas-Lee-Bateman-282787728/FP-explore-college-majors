514606,4,6302794404,"This special, while being a warm, funny, and imaginative take on what happens to toys once kids leave the vicinity, contains a surprising bite of frigidness; the fear of being caught by humans, and the resulting death-like state that awaits all toys who step out of line, make this show unique, and timeless. Peppered with heartbreaking moments throughout, Christmas Toy also captures the tender feelings experienced by children on Christmas Day. This is not standard kiddie stuff, and adults should not shy away from watching this one. This story is about a roomful of toys and their adventures on Christmas Eve. Rugby the Tiger Cub is the little girl Jamie's favorite toy, and Apple the doll, Jamie's former favorite toy, is trying to make Rugby understand that a new favorite toy will be coming to replace Rugby tonight. Rugby refuses to believe it and ventures out to the living room to take his rightful place under the Christmas tree, but Apple and the rest of the toys know that if Rugby is found out of place by humans, he'll be frozen forever. There is genuine danger and suspense, as the toys actually ""die"" if caught outside the playroom by a human. For me, this film contains the suspense and excitement of Christmas Eve itself, the possibility of being caught, or catching Santa in the act - feelings I felt as a child sneaking down to the tree on Christmas Eve myself. I've always felt this film perfectly captured the magic, joy, and terrifying butterflies which reside in all children on Christmas Eve. I had a VHS copy of this when I was younger, but was ecstatic to find it on dvd a few years ago. The film is filled with life lessons, excitement, suspense, songs, laughter, and tears. Even as an adult, I still cry upon viewing. By far, one of the best Jim Henson movies ever made, though pretty much everything he made was the best. I think the last time they showed this was in 1993 or around that time, which was/is really heartbreaking, as it really is an excellent movie. I have been racking my brain for the past 10 years or so (around the holidays) trying to remember the name of this movie. Finally, just a few minutes ago i decided to put in a search engine, ""jim henson christmas movie about toys"" as i had to do with the obscure jim henson tv show called what people? ""The Storyteller""If you weren't a video-phile like me, you wouldn't be able to tell this was shot in the 80's, the quality was perfect - not grainy or faded or anything! Unfortunately, I'm not much of an audio-phile, so I could not provide much on the sound quality except for the fact that it says on the back it is Dolby 2.0. The only thing that gave away the fact this movie was shot in the 80's was the types of clothes the people were wearing!!
My one and only complaint is that the ending is a bit sugarcoated, the happy resolution is sudden, and seems to contradict several ""rules"" in the toy universe; however, I understand Henson's choice, as Christmas should ultimately be a happy, joyous occasion free from fear and sadness.",1459987200,2,3033,4.56697247706422
514637,5,6302794404,"This is a great Christmas movie. My family ranks it right up there with ""Elf"". We recorded this off the tv when my children were kids and watched it every Christmas therafter. Then the video was lost for a while, and everything went to DVD, and for some reason, it never appeared on network tv again. When I saw this was available, I purchased *two* (in case something happened to the first). We still all love ""Meteora"" and now we can enjoy this with my grand-daughter.",1458086400,,470,4.476744186046512

514642,5,6302794404,Very entertaining!  My granddaughter was very interested in the story line about the last year's Christmas toys feeling left out with new toys to be under the tree this year!  She is only 3 1/2 yrs old and felt empathy for the old toys.,1454976000,,236,4.340909090909091

514689,5,6302794404,"This was my favorite Christmas movie as a child.  I saw so many reviews saying that the loss of Kermit was a huge deal.  Yes the intro with him is missing, but it still starts off just fine.  And the ""Old Friends, New Friends"" song at the end is still there.  So I am not sure why people are complaining about that.  Kermit is missing yes, but this movie wasn't about him.  Rugby Tiger is my all time favorite and this copy was still as amazing as I remember it!  I bought three copies which arrived very quickly for myself and two of my friends with young children.  Gotta spread the Rugby Tiger love!

It was one of my favorite Christmas movies as a child (only behind Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas and the original Miracle on 34th Street). I felt as if I had just watched it recently and was flooded with memories and happiness! I still love Rugby and Mew the most, and still think it's messed up that these toys essentially ""die"" when seen unfrozen, but also crack up at it now. Sadly, the joy of this particular Christmas show was missed by my sister and cousin when they were younger so showing it to them now they just thought it was totally messed up and bizarre...

514972,1,6302794404,"This is a sweet and beautiful holiday special made by Jim Henson, unfortunately Disney now has the rights to the muppets so nearly three very large scenes where Kermit The Frog narrates the story and even joins in the singing are cut out because this film is owned by The Henson Company but the Muppets are owned by Disney.

This is shameful. They actually cut Jim Henson, himself, out of a Jim Henson holiday special because of the internal politics of Disney / Jim Henson Company.  Disney, of course, did not wand this 1986 Holiday special released because roughly eight years later Disney released a film with a very similar plot known as Toy Story.

One company should make a deal with the other to fully restore this sweet, holiday film to the way it was when Jim Henson first made it, the way he intended it.",1391040000,4,814,4.523809523809524

I much prefer the uncut version as well as the uncut version of A MUPPET FAMILY CHRISTMAS. The U.K. DVD release of that special has parts my vhs version didn't have and it has the full version of THE CHRISTMAS TOY (2 full specials in one DVD). So that is why I got that DVD over ebay. Even though it is region 2, I have been able to play it on all my players so I recommend getting that version of the 2 specials.",1386892800,,572,3.8559322033898304

I still have it on VHS and it feels strange not having the Kraft commercials and the other old Christmas commercials.",1384300800,,349,4.17910447761194
515070,5,6302794404,"This Jim Henson Christmas special is short- I think about 40 minutes long- and is just as good today as it was when I first watched it 20+ years ago. I realize they edited out the parts of the movie that included Kermit, which were just an introduction at the beginning and a song at the end where he joined in with the rest of the toys, but the most important part of the film is still intact. This story is about a roomful of toys and their adventures on Christmas Eve. Rugby the Tiger Cub is the little girl Jamie's favorite toy, and Apple the doll, Jamie's former favorite toy, is trying to make Rugby understand that a new favorite toy will be coming to replace Rugby tonight. Rugby refuses to believe it and ventures out to the living room to take his rightful place under the Christmas tree, but Apple and the rest of the toys know that if Rugby is found out of place by humans, he'll be frozen forever.

The message of friendship is simple, beautiful and poignant. This was my favorite Christmas movie as a child, and now I'm able to share it with my 3-year-old son, who loves it as much as I do. Jim Henson's legacy lives on and continues to touch new generations.",1383782400,,1173,4.3076923076923075

515103,2,6302794404,"Just so there's no confusion, I love The Christmas Toy, and the 2-star rating has nothing to do with that.  However, this October 2013 release (catalog number HE9377) suffers the same problem as the previous DVD release: the intro and summary by Kermit the Frog have been cut!  I was hoping that with this new Vivendi-Henson licensing and release agreement we'd see a full version on DVD, but no luck.  It looks like the only option for a full copy of The Christmas Toy is still the old 1998 Columbia Tri-Star VHS release.

Aside from that, however, it's still a good-looking transfer at a budget price.  It's a minimal production, with no booklet or special features, but the video and audio are just as crisp as I've ever seen them.  So, as long as you don't mind missing out on a few minutes of our dear Kermit dressed up like Santa setting the mood, I'd say go for it.  But, if you want the real deal, dust off the old VCR and start hitting up eBay!",1381449600,13,953,4.380681818181818

515203,5,6302794404,"I saw The Christmas Toy when I was just little when it first premiered on television. To this very day, it remains my absolute favorite Christmas special of all time; I generally watch it every Christmas Eve. I am a huge Jim Henson fan, but do not expect Kermit, Piggy, and friends here, although Kermit does narrate the story. Our main character is a stuffed Tiger named Rugby, who, along with a doll named Apple, and a cat toy named Mew, goes on a very dangerous mission on Christmas Eve to get downstairs and wrapped beneath the Christmas tree, as he does not understand that he will not be this year's Christmas toy. I find this special very adult in nature, which I highly appreciate. There is genuine danger and suspense, as the toys actually ""die"" if caught outside the playroom by a human. For me, this film contains the suspense and excitement of Christmas Eve itself, the possibility of being caught, or catching Santa in the act - feelings I felt as a child sneaking down to the tree on Christmas Eve myself. I've always felt this film perfectly captured the magic, joy, and terrifying butterflies which reside in all children on Christmas Eve. I had a VHS copy of this when I was younger, but was ecstatic to find it on dvd a few years ago. The film is filled with life lessons, excitement, suspense, songs, laughter, and tears. Even as an adult, I still cry upon viewing. If you're looking to share the magic of Christmas with your children, I most highly recommend this virtually unseen masterpiece.",1356825600,,1513,4.607407407407408

515249,4,6302794404,"A Christmas Toy is a family favorite Christmas special that was originally released as a TV special back in 1986.  I was fortunate enough to record the special on a video tape.

Being a family favorite we did watch the video over and over again and the tape was beginning to show its age.  So I shelved it for 5 years in the hopes that I would get a new tape.  While a tape was released in the 90's, I pretty much all but forgotten about the special, until I thought of it again around the time I bought a DVD player.  Alas, at that time the special wasn't released on that format, BUT was on VHS.

Having kids of my own now, I decided to once again play the waiting game in favor of getting the show on the more 'permanent' DVD format since I know I would be playing it often.  And as my memory has it, once again, I ended up forgetting about the show.

Enter Christmas 2011 and the show came up in a family discussion 3 days before Christmas.  Naturally I hopped on-line to see if the show was released on DVD.  I was thrilled to find out that it was.  So I immediately placed a rush order on the DVD so I would have it for Christmas.

It was THEN after the fact, that I did some reading on the reviews to see what others thought about the special (in general), when I read that the beginning and ending were cropped from the DVD to remove the scenes that contained Kermit The Frog.  While I was disappointed, I still decided to go through the purchase.

Tonight (12-27-2011), I viewed the DVD with my sons and I must say that it is still a good purchase.  The editing is done tastefully and in good places, so for those that never seen it before, you would really not know that there were deleted scenes.  Still, I know they are gone.

Doing a bit of research to find out why the DVD was released this way and not the VHS, I found out that the VHS release was done by Walt Disney Studios, which at that time owned the rights to all of Jim Henson's work.

Today, Jim Henson's work is released under the Lionsgate name.  However, the rights for the Muppets is still owned by Disney.  Apparently it must have been too costly for Lionsgate to license the presence of Kermit The Frog in The Christmas Toy, so they probably did the next best thing...edit Kermit out.

Now, would I have paid more to cover the licensing so that the special would be scene in it's entirety?  Yes, probably.  I like to see shows...especially those that have memorable meaning to my (and my family's) past, to be seen complete.  So I have mixed feelings about the removal of the scenes with Kermit.

That being said, the rest of The Christmas Toy was left intact.  Nothing else was removed from the mid section of the show.

I do know that Lionsgate tried to save a buck here, but as I said, in a case like this I would have paid a little extra just to have the special shown in it's entirety.

For those that bought the DVD and have not seen the sections with Kermit, basically in the beginning, the show starts with Kermit the frog sitting on the edge of the chimney on the roof of the house where the story takes place.  He begins his narration when he accidentally slips and falls into the children's playroom.  He continues to describe to the audience the playroom and what happens when no one is around.  He crawls back up the chimney exclaiming that it is ""Harder getting up this thing than getting down"".  The scene then shifts to a mobile on the ceiling that starts to spin around and the opening number starts...this is where the DVD starts directly.

At the end of the show, the song, ""Old Friends, New Friends"" had a reprise right after Jamie (the girl in the story) leaves the room.  (The DVD ends right at this point).  During the reprise that was cut out...Kermit enters the playroom and joins in.  The main thing that I miss with this scene being cut out is that after the song ends you can see the old toys interacting with the new toys.  For example, Meteora finds the Barbie doll and starts to chit chat with her.  It is a major loss that the scenes are missing?  No.  But it would have been nice to have the show complete as I remember it.",1324944000,3,4135,4.26478149100257

It's unfortunate that it no longer airs on TV during the holidays because I consider it a classic, and something that this generation of kids should be introduced to. The Muppets are timeless, and I'm proud to be the owner of this DVD, as I look forward to introducing it to my kids in the future.

Sometimes when you see the stuff you remember fondly from your childhood, it can be disappointing because it used ""stupid"" more than you remembered (Like Charlie Brown!!) or it was REALLY boring!  This is GREAT!!  It is lively and entertaining... a 1980's Toy Story.  Though it has no reference to Christ, it teaches that if you think of yourself as better than others people's feelings can get hurt.  It has a great moral story, and it uses Christmas to convey the message.  Again, no reference to the birth of Jesus, but a good message in putting others before you.

515314,5,6302794404,"I recall this film well and we already own the old British release but the fact that Disney has not allowed Kermit to appear on this dvd is yet another example of how Henson's creative spirit is ultimately usurped by the market place. We all remember how much overlap there was between Henson's worlds; Fraggles would appear in Muppet films, Sesame Muppets appeared along side Fraggles and Muppets and this conveyed the most important thing in Henson's world, the family unit, his family was reflected here and what Disney and Hit should know by now, is that one product will support the other; these are old films, just waver the rights and someone take note, the Muppet franchise works at it's best when the Muppet family supports each other. These are old films, just leave them alone ..... by editing this film they have spoilt it, Kermit and the cast end the story in a huge sing song and musically, they have butcher the ending.

What made the magic of such Muppet specials is that they were part of the Muppet family and as an audience we were invited in to this family and made to feel apart of it. That was the magic of such work and I find it hard watching this version now, it just doesn't gel well for me. The Christmas Toy was released on to dvd in England as an extra bonus feature along with The Muppet Family Christmas dvd (in 2001 as a Columbria/Tristar release), so the original is out there still, if only second hand.

I am not a Henson purist at all and Jim Henson was a man who understood the balance between art and business, however he isn't around now and cutting up these old films spoils something of that creative spirit. I will be careful as to the Henson dvd's I buy in the future, now knowing the legalities which prevent imaginative work enduring intact and live with my childhood memorabilia as it is because that time when Henson's stories ruled the airwaves will not return again with the same level of panache and enlightened idealistic rebelliousness.

It does have heart, as all Muppet productions during the Jim Henson era had, and imagination. A lot of creativity went into developing the puppets to look and feel like toys. So that makes it watchable, but not a must-have.

since then, i had always wondered when they were gonna release it on dvd and, for a long time, thought it would never happen. i figured it was too obscure a movie to put money into a dvd release.

come to my surprise, i randomly found it at best buy this last christmas. i literally felt like a 2-year-old again. i was slightly disappointed by the movie jacket, as i didn't see kermit anywhere. he is the narrator and introduces all of the characters in the beginning of the movie. i put the dvd in and found out that they cut him out of the movie completely. i assume there were some sort of copyright laws and the company releasing it would have to pay to have him in the movie.

if you've never seen the movie, i highly recommend picking it up. it is a wonderful movie and a lost gem in the henson family. if you still cherish analog technology, i recommend picking up the vhs copy as well<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Christmas-Toy/dp/B001EN5I40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Christmas Toy</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jim-Henson-Muppets-The-Christmas-Toy-VHS/dp/0767815971/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jim Henson Muppets: The Christmas Toy [VHS</a>] so you can have the full christmas toy experience with kermit the frog dressed as santa.

My kids (12, 10, 6) thought it was creepy too. The girl doll takes some getting used to... she'd be cute if she didn't look like the sister of Chuckie (from the Halloween movies). I can't imagine Jim Henson using some of the mean words either, which you hear over & over: ""stupid"", as the toys refer to each other; & ""brats"" & ""monsters"", as the older sibling (not seen, only heard) refers to the younger siblings. And, that Barbie... OMG - she could not be any MORE superficial (& creepy!)! (What kind of message was THAT for girls?!)  Maybe we expect more in this day & age, but I've only ever known Jim Henson to be GENTLE & KIND with his stories for children. This was EXTREMELY disappointing!! Even the way the toys treat each other... they're rude, inconsiderate, & the main character/the tiger is repeatedly condescending... & that's how it treats its BEST friend (another toy)!! Yes, there was a 'lesson', but we found it to be totally lost behind all the negativity. And,there wasn't much about it that was at all Christmasy. Most of the show is set in the playroom & the darkened hallway. It's all about a selfish tiger who doesn't want to lose his spot as the 'favorite toy' when the kids get new toys for Christmas. And, that new toy... did it have to be a rough, villain type of doll? Were they trying for a model of a 'powerful' girl doll? Bcs it missed its mark!! Yes, the toys helped each other; yes, the tiger learns his lesson, but there was really no explanation for HOW the tiger learns its lesson. Suddenly it just understands the nice doll & realizes the error of it's condescending ways. And, the quality... NOT at ALL what we would expect from Jim Henson puppets!! The caliber of this show was not in Jim Henson's league in any way whatsoever. These are NOT the Muppets! And, I never thought I'd be negative about a Jim Henson production!

Unless you have throttled your inner child, the heart warming story of a toy learning what it means to be selfless and to think of others while on his search to stay the most important one in the heart of the child that owns him will still leave that warm spot in your heart.

515402,4,6302794404,"After many years of fans begging, HiT entertainment has finally given us a DVD of one of Jim Henson's great forgotten specials. ""The Christmas Toy"" tells of a stuffed tiger named Rugby, one of many toys that come to life when their children aren't around (this a full 10 years before ""Toy Story,"" I should point out). It's Christmas Eve and Rugby, who was Jamie's Christmas present last year, thinks it's time for him to get back into the box and be the center of attention all over again. But there's a new, less cooperative toy already there, waiting to be opened.

The special hasn't lost a bit of its charm. It's heartwarming, beautifully made, and full of great music. The only problem is that -- thanks to the fact that the Jim Henson company no longer owns the Muppets -- they had to cut the host segments with Kermit the Frog. It makes the beginning quite abrupt, as if you tuned in after the first commerical break or something.

The special is wonderful. The DVD is another story. The transfer is weak -- it looks like it was taken from a well-preserved VHS tape. And there's absolutely nothing in the way of special features, not a scrap.

As a fan of this special, I'm ecstatic that it's finally available. People who remember this special, parents looking for something new to show your kids that they've likely never heard of before, this is definitely worth getting. But it just seems they could have put a little more effort into it.",1228608000,,1449,4.565384615384615

I'm just happy I can share this story with my kids and it brings such warm memories from Christmas when I was a kid.  It is truly The Original ""Toy Story"".
Now, I love Pixar, but they completely ripped off the idea from Jim Henson.  I wish credit was put where credit is due.
Enjoy this one, it truly is a Christmas Classic!

Here is a synopsis of the story from IMDb:
When no people are around, the toys still play in the playroom. But since a toy will be frozen forever if a person catches it out of position, they have to be very careful. It's Christmas Eve, and Rugby the Tiger remembers how he was the Christmas Toy last year, and thinks he's going to be unwrapped again. And it's up to Apple the Doll, whom Rugby supplanted as favorite toy, to tell him what's in store. But Rugby won't believe her, and tries to get into the Christmas package and lets Meteora, Queen of the Asteroids loose. Unfortunately, she doesn't know she's a toy, and thinks she's landed among aliens. And it's up to Apple, Mew (the Cat's toy mouse), and the other toys to get Rugby out of the box and Meteora back in it before they're found and frozen.",1227657600,,1441,4.272058823529412

515408,5,6302794404,"How sad is this...? My sister and I, who are 27 and 30 respectively, think this is the most fun Christmas movie to watch together around the holidays! When our mother taped it off the TV (and we still have that...and every single commercial is for some kind of margarine, which they don't do anymore [that is, run only one product's commercials during a program]) we watched it over a few Christmases and then forgot about it. In high school we rediscovered the tape and thought the story was really stupid and childish...but then, despite ridiculing the idiocy of the stinking mouse ""Mew"" and the wide-eyed vacuousness of ""Apple"" the doll (maybe Gwynnie Paltrow liked this movie too and named her poor daughter after that character...?), we ended up watching it every Christmas since. And of course the busty Meteora, who is as close to a villain as this show has, is particularly worthwhile, with her outrageous ""outer space"" breastplate and diva-esque song. In truth the songs are memorable, like ""Old Friends, New Friends"" and of course, as it's a Muppet production, one would be hard pressed to find even the most jaded Gen-X'er who wouldn't smile at the antics of Jim Henson's creations.

For those who have never seen the 1986 original, this will make no difference.  For myself and my kids, who fell in love with the original version, this Kermit exorcism is quite sad.  Plus, the song finale was an important closing celebration of the show.

The DVD transfer is pristine, but one star is missing, in tribute to the missing green frog dressed in a Santa suit.  I'm sure there are purist Henson fans who will not be as generous as I.

515425,5,6302794404,"I recall this film well and we already own the old British release but the fact that Disney has not allowed Kermit to appear on this dvd is yet another example of how Henson's creative spirit is ultimately usurped by the market place. We all remember how much overlap there was between Henson's worlds; Fraggles would appear in Muppet films, Sesame Muppets appeared along side Fraggles and Muppets and this conveyed the most important thing in Henson's world, the family unit, his family was reflected here and what Disney and Hit should know by now, is that one product will support the other; these are old films, just waver the rights and someone take note, the Muppet franchise works at it's best when the Muppet family supports each other. These are old films, just leave them alone ..... by editing this film they have spoilt it, Kermit and the cast end the story in a huge sing song and musically, they have butcher the ending.

What made the magic of such Muppet specials is that they were part of the Muppet family and as an audience we were invited in to this family and made to feel apart of it. That was the magic of such work and I find it hard watching this version now, it just doesn't gel well for me. The Christmas Toy was released on to dvd in England as an extra bonus feature along with The Muppet Family Christmas dvd (in 2001 as a Columbria/Tristar release), so the original is out there still, if only second hand.

I am not a Henson purist at all and Jim Henson was a man who understood the balance between art and business, however he isn't around now and cutting up these old films spoils something of that creative spirit. I will be careful as to the Henson dvd's I buy in the future, now knowing the legalities which prevent imaginative work enduring intact and live with my childhood memorabilia as it is because that time when Henson's stories ruled the airwaves will not return again with the same level of panache and enlightened idealistic rebelliousness.

Rugby the tiger is my very favorite, along with Mew, the mouse! Rugby isn't very nice to Mew at first because Mew smells like catnip, which makes Rugby sneeze. Rugby calls him a cat toy, which makes Mew feel sad. But Mew comes in handy when he helps Rugby get to the Christmas tree! Rugby thinks that he will be Jamie's Christmas toy again this year, and doesn't quite understand that there will be a different toy in the box this time. Apple, the doll, along with other memorable characters, come to rescue him from the living room because if he gets seen by humans, he'll be frozen forever. The songs are darling in this movie, especially ""Try the Impossible"", ""Toys love to Play"", and ""Old Frinds, Dear Friends."" My favorite part of this movie is when Rugby sings to Mew and then they give each other a big hug.  Rugby and Mew are very darling characters. It's a wonderful movie that's nifty for not only Christmas, but all year round!",1100476800,6,1370,4.3062015503875966
515470,5,6302794404,"How sad is this...?  My sister and I, who are 27 and 30 respectively, think this is the most fun Christmas movie to watch together around the holidays!  When our mother taped it off the TV (and we still have that...and every single commercial is for some kind of margarine, which they don't do anymore [that is, run only one product's commercials during a program]) we watched it over a few Christmases and  then forgot about it.  In high school we rediscovered the tape and thought the story was really stupid and childish...but then, despite ridiculing the idiocy of the stinking mouse ""Mew"" and the wide-eyed vacuousness of ""Apple"" the doll (maybe Gwynnie Paltrow liked this movie too and named her poor daughter after that character...?), we ended up watching it every Christmas since. And of course the busty Meteora, who is as close to a villain as this show has, is particularly worthwhile, with her outrageous ""outer space"" breastplate and diva-esque song.  In truth the songs are memorable, like ""Old Friends, New Friends"" and of course, as it's a Muppet production, one would be hard pressed to find even the most jaded Gen-X'er who wouldn't smile at the antics of Jim Henson's creations.  Merry Christmas!",1094428800,31,1216,4.878640776699029

This movie makes me feel like a child again. I also reccomennd A Very Muppet Christmas, if you like this movie, as in that movie they have all of the muppets, maybe ABC Family will play this as a christmas Special as part of thier 25 days of Christmas, now that Disney has rights to the muppets.",1086220800,2,528,4.038095238095238

7831628,4,6302794404,It's cute my daughter enjoyed it but pretty juvenile if you're looking for a classic but worth the money and enjoyment it brought her. Jim Henson puppets are always cool. Only lasts about thirty minutes which is about long enough for the atoet,1515888000,,243,4.674418604651163

7831631,5,6302794404,"I grew up watching this movie on a VHS tape.... my dad had recorded the show when it was on tv in the 80's. Well now I have children of my own (1 & 2.5 year old). So we pulled out that VHS tape & let's just say it was in rough shape. I was so surprised that I could purchase it on DVD. Now if only it included the commercials from the 80's like the one my dad recorded. Anyway, it's a cute movie. It's not a long movieMy girls love watching it & they love the songs the toys sing.

This movie is everything. I watch it year-round. It still cheers me up. I wish the Jim Henson company would have created plush animals, my life would be complete! I think I've bought this for everyone who has children who would appreciate it [or I at least hope they will!]

You're children won't be disappointed!",1492732800,,469,4.269662921348314
7831636,5,6302794404,"Potentially the best Christmas film of all time. For many years as a child I took on face value this film's assertion that stuffed animals come alive while we are not looking, and always took care to warn them before I came in so I would not accidentally murder the souls of my own toys.",1491350400,,287,4.236363636363636
