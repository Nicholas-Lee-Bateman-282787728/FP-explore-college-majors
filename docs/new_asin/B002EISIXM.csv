8367743,5,B002EISIXM,"JACK BENNY 'TREASURE BOX' COLLECTION. Don't let the flimsy packaging fool you. This DVD contains a live one hour special with Jack's guests The Beach Boys, who take part in comedy sketches and perform a couple of their latest hits. I have not found this special in any other Benny collection. Also contains two TV episodes.",1499299200,,323,4.785714285714286
