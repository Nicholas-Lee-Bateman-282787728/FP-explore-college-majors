I had just started using coupons and was successful in that I was saving money (around $50/month).  However, I wanted to save more and receive more for my money.  So, I decided to purchase this DVD to see ""if I was missing anything"".  I found this DVD so incredibly helpful.  It gave me tips I wasn't using and showed me how to stack coupons for items!  What was stacking?!  I wasn't using the store coupons and manufacture coupons like I should; thus, wasn't saving as much money.  After watching this DVD, taking lots of notes and using their tips, I went from saving $50/month to $300/month!  Wow!  Now, that's saving!  It is so much fun leaving a store and realizing you only paid .99 for cereal or that you paid nothing at all!  I love it!  My husband was skeptical at first and thought I was spending too much time on this (there's a learning curve, of course) until he saw how much money we were saving as well as we had reserves for our groceries!  I don't worry about not having anything on hand; we always have a stock pile of our items!  Yeah!

6191380,5,B00HNL27F0,"I began living Frugally last year and with the information available via Fabulessly Frugal website, their video and personal contact back & fourth I am extremely successful.
My husband & I are nearing the end of retirement and every penny we save goes directly on our mortgage so every penny counts.  There is no better feeling cashing out at the register and hearing the cashier say you saved $80 or more.  That is the best payback for any amount of time it has costed me.
I receive 5 papers on Sunday & Wednesday and have learned from the experts how to best utilize all of those coupons and how to pass them onto others so nothing is wasted.
