[Perhaps it's telling that the negative reviewer used ""it's"" when meaning ""its"".]  There are always questions in movies that the viewer spots as, ""How did so many coincidences take place""?  It's just a movie; there is no perfect movie.  It is also important to listen to/read what the director and each actor say in Special Features. This is a keeper for me to view over and over again, enjoying even the important German mathematician's creating the original Mobius.  One has to have a sense of politics, intrigue among nations, history, to name a few.  The film is similar to ""The Patriots"" and ""Notorious."" Count me in on this one...and I do not write reviews often.",1431129600,,774,4.7388059701492535
8572140,3,B00BPBTGCG,"Something seemed very wrong. The film did not deliver it's message until 2/3's of the way in. I understood that this was a film about spies and espionage, but had no real sense of what the plot was. A French film with English sub-titles, is fine with me, love it. The actors handsome, Jean Dujardin, playing a Russian spy meets a beautiful woman, played by Cecile de France, in a bar. Neither says they know what the other dies for a living, and that part I believe. Cecile works for the CIA, and Jean, it's Russian counterpart. Cecile is into high finance, and Jean a journalist.

Into this world come the low lives of Russia, the CIA, and nothing good is going to happen. Cecile and Jean,we are to believe fall madly in love after two meetings and heavy love making. Murders, beatings, threats, high living and money are the name of the game.  Lots of action that doesn't make too much sense in the scheme of things.  Tim Roth plays a ruthless Russian tycoon, and is completely overshadowed in this role. I did not believe his role for a minute.

Not an enjoyable film, nor a believable one, nor one I would recommend. The last scene was the best of the entire film.

Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 04-26-14",1398470400,,1210,4.4818181818181815
