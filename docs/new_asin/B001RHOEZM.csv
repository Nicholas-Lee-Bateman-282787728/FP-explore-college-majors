8338023,5,B001RHOEZM,"Rev. Collins is not only a talented musician, but more importantly for those wanting piano and music lessons he is a remarkably gifted and talented teacher - and is arguably the best piano teacher on the continent. The DVD is expertly shot so that you see exactly what is going on, precisely where to place your fingers on the keyboard, and how to follow the lesson plan without confusion or lack of clarity. He moves at a pace that keeps things simple even as the ideas become more advanced, and the way he explains things and shows how to play is as simple as dirt. There are more famous and popular music teachers out there, but this one can outshine them all and the price of the DVDs he produces make this kind of investment worth its weight in gold.",1251849600,3,755,4.4
