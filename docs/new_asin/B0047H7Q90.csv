8418133,3,B0047H7Q90,"A group of divers aspire to dive on five ships that sank during the Roman Empire to inspect their cargo as the ships have rotted away.  In depths that range from 300  to 500 feet it is three times the depth of a recreational diver (DANGEROUS!)

Was a bit underwhelmed by their finds, it does recreate with computers what some buildings on the island probably looked like. Some insight.",1461456000,,385,4.550724637681159
8418134,4,B0047H7Q90,"Yeah yeah I know that isn't the record or anything but for the average recreational diver that is darn impressive!

What you are getting here is a documentary about a five day expedition to study a number of sunken Roman Empire era ships that were discovered near a small island off Naples. As such you are getting a bit of a history lesson, you are getting some archaeology and you are also getting some interesting dive action (as well as some discussion of ancient recipes!). The whole documentary slots in at just under 60 minutes and the narration is not overblown in its attempts to dramatize the action.

Overall it was nice to see the way that the above different aspects were woven into one show. It was nice in a way to see that the expedition had some successes as well as some challenges. There is no 'Disney' ending to everything here and some failure is experienced. One is left with a fascination for the ancients, a respect for the divers and probably a thirst to learn more about some of the subjects touched upon - such as the role of some of the important women of Rome.

I guess the main issue here is that with so many things thrown into the mix you aren't really getting a lot of the history, nor are you getting right into the nitty gritty of the archaeology and nor are you getting into the technical aspects of the diving.

A nice diversion for any diver or history buff. And if you are both then you'll probably rate this offering around the four star mark.",1377734400,2,1483,4.4212454212454215
8418135,5,B0047H7Q90,"Bought this for use in my classroom.  This documentary is excellent and multidisciplinary: art, history, archaeology, even a bit of biology and scuba diving facts.  Definitely not for young children, but appropriate for juniors and seniors.",1375660800,2,240,5.638888888888889
8418136,4,B0047H7Q90,"I am in awe of Ancient Roman technology. The way they were able to build a harbor on the island of Ventotene, and to provide fresh water to the island through a system of cisterns and tunnels is amazing. I enjoy looking at ship wrecks and the divers take such risk to go down into the water several hundred feet. It's amazing that they have to spend hours decompressing before they can come to the surface.

It would have been nice if they could have explored the shipwrecks more extensively, I wish they had had more footage and more in-depth coverage of what they found. I like the narrator's voice, the film was clear and straightforward, and I liked how they made garum and tasted it.",1351036800,,688,4.4603174603174605
8418137,5,B0047H7Q90,"The only thing I don't care for is the whole pottery segment,except that Long Before the Modern Shipping Containers we have now of Steel in 20'40'45'48'53'(seagoing Containers being 20'40' /40' Highcube,45')there was the Containers the Romans(brilliant as they were)used to stow under their ships in a crazy fashion(the ship could tip over if rough seas.)to store their Foods,Liquors,Wine,etcera. There is also a Segment on Augustus and his Immoral daughter(who some Feminists were defending and trying to excuse by saying she was a Popular Rival to her father Back In Rome.)She was Banished to Exile to the Island Of Ventotene,Italy(Boo hoo,looks like a nice Island to me. Spoiledbrat.)It shows How Genius the Romans were with Engineering for the Roads,Sewer Systems and How they got Fresh Water on The Island such as Ventotene. Augustus Was the First in 18 B.C. to put into Law the Lex Iulia de adulteriis (""Julian Law concerning acts of adultery"")Which considering How Immoral And disgusting Romans were for all their Genius and Contributions(not to mention The Greeks and many other Savages Before Christianity,Aztecs,etcera.)Augustus along with the Greek Aristotle and Of Course Constantine should be considered the Best Ancient Times Gave to us Before Christ. Finally,The Documentary shows the Ingenuity of A Roman Engineered Port that was made.
Very Fascinating indeed and worth watching.",1329091200,2,1395,5.462962962962963
8418138,5,B0047H7Q90,"I thought this documentary was very well done and quite informative.  The footage is beautiful.  I felt that the program had a great balance between the underwater footage, history of the site and objects, and communications and personal interaction between the crew. The computer imaging of objects, etc. and recreation overlays over the remains of the ruins of Julia's exile villa really helped bring the site to life.  Also, showing the modern usage of some of the ancient objects and recreating some Roman dishes brings the subject home; the Romans no longer seem so ""ancient"".

As a scholar of ancient Greece & Rome, I found this documentary fascinating. However I think that anyone interested in underwater archaeology, Roman civilization, or history in general would find this documentary quite entertaining whether you know anything about the subjects at hand or not.  Check it out!",1306886400,2,890,5.195804195804196
8418139,2,B0047H7Q90,"Sonar was used to detect five Roman ships that sunk near a small Italian island.  Some investigators dive to find objects left on the floor of the sea.

I'm wrestling with the purview of ""Secrets of the Dead.""  I assumed the series was about corpses or how ancients died.  Well into the work the narrator says no Roman sailors were found near these sunk objects.  I guess the ""secret"" is what were the objects and ""dead"" doesn't mean the death of a human is the subject of series installments.

This work can be seen as interdisciplinary.  The living serve two ancient Roman dishes; this could be shown on Food Network.  Augustus' daughter Julia was exciled on this island.  Much is said here about her.  This was ancient history and perhaps women's studies.  There is also engineering discussed here.  Romans made a port and they had to move tons of stone underwater to do so.

They only pull up two items when it seems like thousands of artefacts are down there.  You never learn concretely what the third pile sought was.  The excursion was over five days and I didn't get why they didn't just spend more time there or not make the doc until they could have completed multiple dives.  The narrator stated that the items were 300-plus feet underwater.  Is that a lot?!  On an individual level I see it.  However, if others could raise parts of the Titanic, then why was this so difficult?  Yes, humans might not survive down there, but why not just use machines with arms, again like with Titanic?

I appreciate learning and growing from this installment.  However, this episode just wasn't as exciting or revealing as other ""Secrets of the Dead"" presentations.  Though I don't blame the doc makers in the slightest, the objects were dull and junky-looking too.  This was not like looking at the revealing paintings on Ancient Greek pottery.  This was a good effort, just a little ho-hum.",1297987200,5,1890,4.689024390243903
