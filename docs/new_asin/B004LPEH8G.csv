8434553,4,B004LPEH8G,"I am a fan of the Benoit family and their approach to deer hunting.  I don't hunt the way they do, I don't have the skills.  But, I do admire folks who hunt land open to the public and routinely take big bucks as they do.",1388793600,,221,3.782608695652174
8434554,4,B004LPEH8G,"The Benoit family has been referred to as the ""First Family of Whitetail Deer Hunting"".  I would agree.  I have read their books and enjoyed them.  This was my second of their video's, so that should be an endorsement in and of itself.  I admire the family.
They hunt the old way; on land open to the public for the most part, no game feeders or others to find their deer for them.

They shoot big bucks.  I have often thought the only animals allowed in the record books should come from land accessible to the public.  When you hunt a ""farm"" no matter how big, where the herd has been ""managed"" through feeding programs, select culling, and genetic manipulation it seems the deck has been stacked.  If you hunt the farms don't call yourself a hunter, you are a shooter.  The Benoits are hunters.  I am a shooter for the most part.  I do a lot of preseason scouting, so I pretty much know where the deer are going to be.  I usually get skunked when I ""hunt"" the big woods.",1388793600,2,973,4.285714285714286
8434555,5,B004LPEH8G,"I had hunted Maine
 a few times before buying this video ,it taught me Quite a bit about Maine woods hunting,swamps,Bogs etc.
I have hunted with a master guide, who has since retired. the quality of deer they harvest is amazing. I think I had snow 1 time.
It's hard to pattern a deer, hunting 1 week at a time.the video has very good footage of some of their best adventures...
Good Job...",1370649600,2,389,4.328767123287672
