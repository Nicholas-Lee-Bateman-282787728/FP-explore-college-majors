8183454,2,B000O76TK4,"The first ""Kung Fu Mahjong"" was funny and silly. After the first on, the gags became risqu, and just gross. This series could have been a great cult classic if not for the vulgarity.",1393459200,,182,4.382352941176471
8183455,4,B000O76TK4,"This is a fun  and very funny movie, if you like Majhong and if you know chinese it is helpful biut if you don't there are subtitles and just watching the move can make you laugh",1226793600,,178,3.9444444444444446
8183456,4,B000O76TK4,"While not as funny as the second installment of the Kung Fu Mahjong franchise, Vol. 3 delivers enough laughs, silly humor, slapstick and Mahjong action to keep this Mahjong enthusiast happy. It's not suppose to be serious....just entertaining, and...it's cheap. Cheers",1216771200,,268,5.560975609756097
