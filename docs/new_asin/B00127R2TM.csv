8244625,5,B00127R2TM,A great story and series which doesn't get enough recognition sometimes. This volume is awesome and the slip cover is so damn cool with Top cow illustrations on the front and funimation illustrations on the back.,1388707200,,212,4.916666666666667
8244626,5,B00127R2TM,"I was interested in the series which was view on TV. I enjoy collecting good anime, yet due to the economy purchasing the anime I enjoy from the retailer is not an option due to the value & price range of the items. I am gald amazon has reasonable prices & a wide range of seller who can meet the buyers demand.  More impressed with the arrive time of the my order & how well the merchandise was package with care from the seller. Many times online purchasing can be rather hesitant but I am planning to make furture purchases with amazon & its vendors.",1360022400,,553,4.266666666666667
8244627,5,B00127R2TM,this is the next to last installment and you can tell because issues are being resolved with each story and they are building to a climax unlike anything you expected.,1337472000,,167,4.6
8244628,5,B00127R2TM,"Super sexy anime based on the graphic novel line that Top Cow has been faithfully producing for many years, now. Linked closely to the Darkness in the books, and thus Magdalena, there is no tie-in to the traditional myhtos here: slightly disappointing, but still a ton of hot action. Definitely not suitable for young viewers, gratuitous violence, sexual content and adult situations. Superb anime.",1228176000,,398,5.234375
8244629,3,B00127R2TM,"personally I like alot of action in my anime with a decent story, for me the story dosn't have to be all that great. Witchblade on the other hand has a good story but in this volume I feel the action is lacking. The writers chose to concentrate more on having the characters doing other thigs rather that have them fight and I was dissapointed because of that. and because of that I don't think I will watch this series again or at least not for a long time when I'm bored and I've forgotten what this anime is all about. I just love lots of violence in my anime thats all.",1208131200,2,573,4.125
8244630,4,B00127R2TM,"You will enjoy the continuation of the series
there were some twist that i did not see coming
and that was a good surprise.",1207180800,,123,4.166666666666667
8244631,5,B00127R2TM,"This is one of the best volumes yet in my opinion. Now, with the Witchblade series near the end things heat up as Douji Group Industries comes under fire and a new clone blade emerges. Masane finds out how powerful the Witchblade truly is and an unbelievable plot twist takes place at the NSWF. This is sure to get the audiences attention as Masane now fights for her life, love, and freedom to live with her daughter in peace.",1205971200,2,427,4.417721518987341
