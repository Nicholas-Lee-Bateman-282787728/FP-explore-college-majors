work. If you are interested of knowing Jesus the way the Gospel shows Him, instead of what religion thought us...",1320451200,11,362,4.671875

7801661,3,1933207531,"I have several John Eldredge books and he is a very good author.  His material is scripturally accurate and his writing style is easy to read and understand.  I purchased the book, along with the DVD series and found that the DVD is word for word, read from the book.  If you have not purchased or read the book then the DVD series would be great, but definitely not a useful addition to the book.  I thought it was going to be a study with further insights to the book, I guess I did not read or understand the descriptions or all the reviews thoroughly enough.",1408492800,,562,4.273584905660377
7801662,5,1933207531,I offered this series as a small book study group. The material is excellent! The DVD is an excellent accompaniment to the book. John Eldredge stirs up topics to discuss and also helps the book to come alive!,1398643200,,208,4.5
7801663,1,1933207531,"Please, DON'T take this as a review of content of the book/dvd.  I was really disappointed in this DVD.  I was part of a Bible Study in which we all purchased the book ""Beautiful Outlaw,"" (which is excellent and I'd recommend to anyone!) We also purchased this DVD, thinking it would have a little more expounding on the book.  All the DVD is, is John reading sections of the chapter, word for word, as whats in the book.  It could be nice to have a little refresher as to what we've read in the week before, but in my opinion, NOT worth the $25 we paid for it.  That's what I use my highlighter for.",1363132800,15,600,4.182608695652174
7801664,5,1933207531,"I read this book and fell in love with Jesus all over again.  Next week we will begin our first small group study using this material.  I'm really excited to share this passionate, personal look at Jesus with my friends.",1356912000,2,220,4.475
7801665,5,1933207531,great small group item. fantastic summarization of key parts to each chapter. if you want to share this amazing book with family or small group then you need this dvd set,1337731200,3,170,4.516129032258065
7801666,5,1933207531,"This 18 part series is an excellent way to study the personality of Christ Jesus.  Eldredge does this in a personal way that is very enjoyable for those involved.  This would be an excellent DVD study for a small group at your church or for individuals in your home.  I would recommend the book to read along with the study, though it is not required it will enhance the study as it will cause each individual to personally contemplate the chapter being studied prior to the lesson presentation.

I love that John Eldredge explores the multi-faceted character  of Jesus in a way that opens the individuals eyes to the richness of his Character.  This series will cause people to see that Jesus was not an always smiling, cookie cutter Rabi, but a Savior filled with intensity, passion, love and humor - A Savior driven by the spirit to reach the wayward of this world, love the hurting, mend the broken and bring chastisement to the arrogantly proud rebellious of the time - as well as of this time.

Wonderful DVD  curriculum.

Thank you Zondervan for this review copy.",1333584000,,1070,4.648936170212766
7801667,5,1933207531,My wife and I were so impressed with the teaching series by Ransomed Heart that we purchased one for my brother and one to keep to show friends. This is an amazing exposition of the New Testaments description of the personality of Jesus Christ. John Eldredge debunks so many of the myths that have been presented as doctrine over the centuries about who Jesus Christ is. He uses the Holy Scripture to do this. I believe he (John) is anointed by The Holy Spirit in this presentation. Ransomed Heart has put out so many wonderful teaching resources over the years. Beautiful Outlaw is the best of the best. I urge you to buy this DVD series if you want a more developed and closer relationship with Jesus our Lord and Savior.,1324166400,,723,4.526717557251908
