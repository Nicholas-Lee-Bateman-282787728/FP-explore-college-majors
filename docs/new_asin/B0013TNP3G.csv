8252805,1,B0013TNP3G,The last four cds didn't work.  The labels were poorly installed and would not allow them to play in multiple cd players.  The material was great.  I wish I could have listened to all of the CDs.,1461110400,,195,4.216216216216216
8252806,1,B0013TNP3G,3 of the 10 CD's in the set were unplayable. Made me very upset. Should never have bought from this vendor.,1461024000,,107,4.142857142857143
8252807,5,B0013TNP3G,"If you are in sales this is a MUST for you!!  The approaches are known in the sales community but usually carry a different label.  However, Tony gives you the recipe for doing it in the right order and gives you example (role playing) to make it real.  I have been through other selling strategy classes and never got as much as I did from this set of tapes.  To me, it is worth every cent!",1222128000,29,391,4.105263157894737
