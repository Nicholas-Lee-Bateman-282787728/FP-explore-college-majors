To me it is refreshing to see scooby and shaggy in a normal situation that they act like their crazy clumsy selves. It is still a great movie to watch with kids or just to enjoy the cute and funny stories that are told.

And after watching 20 minutes and seeing none of the rest of the gang, no mysteries or puzzles to solve, my 5yo asked to turn it off. That was a first. And I had to agree with him...this movie is just plain boring, and certainly not respectful of the culture.",1356307200,2,542,4.43
1840930,1,B00008DP49,This is not really a scooby doo movie. I watched it with my kids for 20 minutes and did not even see the familiar characters. this was not even a cartoon series i had even heard of before.if you are looking for something long and dull this is it.,1344988800,,246,4.040816326530612
1840931,1,B00008DP49,"OK, so I've always liked Scooby-Doo since I was young, so I rented the VHS tape when I first saw it at Blockbuster almost 10 years ago, wondering what this movie was like. I was expecting it to be more like the fun (if cheesy) 1987-1988 Hanna-Barbera Superstar TV movies (there were a few Scooby-Doo ones as well, such as ""Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf""), but unfortunately, this movie is not up to par with those or the earlier Hanna-Barbera productions.

With that said, this entire movie is pretty much unrecognizable as a Hanna-Barbera cartoon, even if it has Scooby, Shaggy, Yogi Bear and Magilla Gorilla! During the nineties, Hanna-Barbera was trying to catch up with the competition (mainly from Warner Bros. and Disney), and began making shows and movies that barely resembled their own distinctive output (""Swat Kats,"" ""Once Upon a Forest"" and ""The Halloween Tree"" especially come to mind.) Instead, this movie looked and sounded more like it was ripping off ""Animaniacs,"" and a bit of Disney as well.

Scooby and Shaggy only appear for 15 minutes out of the film's 70-minute running time, and it's in ""bridging"" segments of stories Shaggy is telling to a geeky Mandark-esque caliph. Shaggy doesn't narrate the two long stories of ""Aliyah-Din"" and Sinbad the Sailor, so it's like it goes into a total different cartoon altogether! These two segments are rather long, and drag out, they're not funny, and the Sinbad/Magilla segment has a bad habit of repeating the same running gags over and over (and this was before ""The Fairly Odd Parents"" was created!) Scooby and Shaggy are a tad out of character, seeming even more cowardly than they originally were, and Yogi constantly keeps begging for food every few minutes (he wasn't ALWAYS doing this in the classic years), and Magilla Gorilla has been drastically dumbed down.

The music is also out of place. Much of it sounds very similar to the energetic and fun music scores from ""Animaniacs"" (same composer and some of the same musicians), and has those Carl Stalling vibes ala the great Looney Tunes shorts of the 1930s to the 1950s. But Hanna-Barbera usually did not resort to that kind of music style. If you look at their older stuff, the music just simply plays along in the background, underscoring the action, yet still helping move the story along. In this, the music keeps stopping and starting, it has to keep moving with each double take or eye blink, and as a result it sounds awkward hearing it under Scooby or Magilla instead of Babs Bunny or Yakko Warner.
Some of the voice talent is pretty good, but it's too bad they were wasted on this movie. This was the final time Don Messick voiced Scooby-Doo, and here it sounds a tad weak compared to the 1980s cartoons. Alan Melvin also reprises his original role of Magilla Gorilla, and many other familiar cartoon voice actors are heard, including Brian Cummings, Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche, Charles Adler, John Kassir, Tony Jay and Kath Soucie.
The sound effects are also often misplaced. For one thing, it doesn't use as many of Hanna-Barbera's famous sound effects, and when it does, they're either sped-up or in bad sound quality. Other times, it usually uses Treg Brown's classic Looney Tunes sound effects, along with the other usual generic sounds nearly every other cartoon produced in 1994 was using, and half the time they are not being used correctly!

The animation is also surprisingly sloppy for 1994 standards. I know Hanna-Barbera's animation usually isn't so great, but here it's just plain bad. The characters look really flat and wonky (even Shaggy and Scooby are drawn quite off-model), the backgrounds are overstylized, the colors are bright and occasionally gaudy, and there are a lot of crude computerized pan-and-zoom effects throughout the movie that actually cause it to blur for a second! You'd think if they could spend all that money for the orchestra music, they could spend more money on animation by shipping it to a decent Japanese company like TMS instead of the cheaper animators at Wang Film Productions in Taiwan.

So, in short, if it weren't for the ""What a Cartoon Show"" premiering the following year, this movie could have meant the end of the line for Hanna-Barbera. No more Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. No more Iwao Takamoto. No more Hoyt Curtin and the rest of the crew. Even sadder, this was the final Scooby-Doo -related cartoon Hanna-Barbera produced, as Warner Bros. Animation had taken over by 1998 beginning with their excellent ""Zombie Island"" movie. Even if you are a hard-core Scooby-Doo fan, I recommend skipping this one.",1332806400,,4602,4.902439024390244
1840932,5,B00008DP49,"Very good Scooby-Doo show, had it in VHS needed it in DVD, found it on Amazon and at a great replacement price that fit my budget and it got to me quickly and in great shape.",1330905600,,174,3.861111111111111
1840933,5,B00008DP49,"I first rented this film at a local Blockbuster Video, expecting another Scooby-Doo adventure (I was on a Scooby-Doo fanatic period.) I was originally disappointed that they are not truly the stars of this story, despite the title, but taken on it's own, I enjoyed it more than expected. They should have titled it as ""Hanna-Barbara Arabian Nights"" hosted by Scooby and Shaggy. Scooby and Shaggy help set up the main stories, however. The movie begins when they travel to Arabia to become ""Royal Food Tasters"" for a young Arab Caliph (voiced by Mandark himself, Eddie Deezen.) who is preparing to choose his bride. Needless to say, it seems to be the perfect job for the two eternally-hungry buddies. By the end of their first day, they have scarfed down the entire Caliph's royal lunch. At this point, they face two problems. First is the fact they the ""Royal Food Tasters"" are not supposed to see if the food is good, but if it is poisoned, but that is small compared to the second problem, that they finished the royal lunch (instead of just sampling each dish.) Finding out the penalty for eating the entire royal lunch is off with the (oh, you know). Scooby and Shaggy try to hide from the Caliph and his goon guards. Unfortunately, they decide to hide in the harem. Remember, the Caliph is supposed to choose his bride that day. Shaggy disguises himself as one of the brides which fools the Caliph (who does not have his glasses) and hatches a plan. He will tell stories to the Caliph which will put him to sleep, so he and Scooby can escape.

From then on, the rest of the film focuses on the two stories that Shaggy tells the Caliph, only briefly returning to Shaggy and Scooby's predicament. The first story is a female version of Aladdin, with the genies played by Yogi ""smarter than the average"" Bear and Boo-Boo. They are no Robin Williams' Genie, but they are Yogi and Boo Boo, and that is good enough. I also liked the new twist on Aladdin being a girl named Aliyah-Din. The second is a variation of Sinbad the Sailor starring Magilla Gorilla and the sailor who ends up instead as the cabin boy of a greedy selfish captain who is searching for treasures such as a eagles egg and a (can you believe it) golden toothbrush. Will each of the stories reach a happy resolution. Will Shaggy and Scooby escape the Caliph, who after one story is convinced that Shaggy is the perfect ""bride"".",1330387200,3,2396,4.572093023255814
1840934,1,B00008DP49,"I love Scooby and have most if not all of the DVDs.  but this one was so bad, i'll not even keep it.  I was glad they tried to join Magilla and Yogi in it, but they did't even inter act with Scooby and Shaggy.  and Scooby and Shaggy are in the whole thing for about 10 mins. A major rip off.  and the animation?  the worst.  The whole thing lookd  like a cheap  sat morning animation dud.  Pass on this.",1319155200,,403,3.876543209876543
1840935,4,B00008DP49,"I was afraid to see the cartoon because of all the negative ratings. So I tamed myself and got the cartoon. I was prepared that there wouldn't be much of Scooby and Shaggy. They run time for the cartoon is 1 hour 6 minutes 31 seconds. Only 14 minutes of the cartoon are dedicated to Scooby and Shaggy. But the point is, it doesn't matter. Yes it confused me at first, but I got used to it after the first 10 minutes. They play the royal food tasters and they will tell two stories in this cartoon which will take the rest of the time. I liked the first story and found the second one quite funny. Although, I didn't like much the drawings. It looked as if a little of a time was spent on drawing. Overall I liked the stories, and I don't consider the time wasted. But the fans of the cartoon will probably find a lot of negative things about the cartoon. If you want to see Shaggy and Scooby through out the whole cartoon, then Arabian Nights is not for you.",1316822400,,958,4.155913978494624
1840936,1,B00008DP49,"This isn't a real Scooby movie.  Scooby and Shaggy are only in it for a few minutes, and the rest is completely unrelated.  I don't recommend at all for Scooby fans.",1315872000,,165,4.290322580645161
1840937,1,B00008DP49,"This is a rip off and Islam propaganda.  Since when do we have cartoon characters praying to Allah?  I guarantee you would not find one praying to God or to Jesus unless it was a Christian cartoon. I was watching this with my grandchildren and was very offended.

1840940,5,B00008DP49,Good movie overall for the kids. If you're an adult...read a good book while they watch it. They will stay entertained throughout the video.,1282867200,,140,4.875
1840941,3,B00008DP49,"I am kind of surprised that this movie was entitled ""Scooby-Doo"" as Scooby (Don Messick) and Shaggy (Casey Kasem) are only in the movie for a few brief moments. Scooby & Shaggy are hired to be the new food tasters for a snotty young Caliph, but they eat all of his food so they have to hide in the harem and pretend to be women. Of course, the Caliph picks Shaggy to be his new bride (his glasses are broken), so Shaggy tells him some stories to stall him and persuade him not to marry him. Scooby tells the Caliph the story of Aladdin/Ala-Din featuring Yogi Bear as the genie and the Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor featuring Magilla Gorilla. Both of them are cute stories that have lots of funny moments and grand adventures - even a little romance! - but neither one of them are Scooby stories.

I did not like this movie nearly as much as the newer Scooby-Doo movies, but I still gave it 3 stars because the children I watched it with really enjoyed it. It was fast-paced, full of action and changing characters so their attention did not flag. I found the quality was not as high as what I expected from a DVD as the movie looked quite pixilated. The kids did not notice this at all and thought everything was great.

The story of Aladdin is turned into Ala-Din as a woman finds the genie's lamp and rescues the prince from the evil vizier. Yogi (Greg Burson) & Boo-Boo (Don Messick) were very cute genies and I enjoyed watching them try and persuade everyone who got the lamp to wish for food. The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor was pretty funny. Magilla Gorilla (Allan Melvin) thinks he is going on a luxury cruise ship, but he really ends up sailing with Sinbad (Allan Melvin) by mistake. Sinbad cons Magilla into going on a scavenger hunt for all of the treasures he wants to find. It was pretty funny to see what the characters got up to, but the story is fairly simplistic - and well known - for adults. If you have young children who like watching animated feature-length films, then they will enjoy this. If you are Scooby-Doo fan, you do not need to watch this as he is only in the movie for about 10 - 15 minutes tops.",1274745600,,2134,4.345864661654136
1840942,5,B00008DP49,"So, you're like me, an absolute Scooby Doo fan and you think that this will be like any other Scooby movie, but when you buy the DVD you find that this is not your run-of-the-mill Scooby Doo adventure. Shaggy and Scooby are going solo in this adventure and wind up in an Arabian palace telling stories to the prince (whatever you call him) and the stories are the main focus of the movie. So be it if this movie has few moments with the amazing duo, the stories that involve loveable characters such as Yogi Bear and Magilla Gorilla are spectacular. This is actually one of my favorites, and while it does take the Scooby Doo brand name a little out of its normal realm, I believe it is a neccessity to the Scooby Doo collection and absolutely worth the couple dollars you would spend to buy it. Don't be so quick to dismiss this one.",1220832000,6,834,4.352564102564102

1840944,1,B00008DP49,"Like countless others have said... It's a dud.  Not worth the money spent or the time wasted.  So boring and even though i love scooby doo and my collection is huge... I would have not have even bought it for the collection if i had seen it first.  I don't care who you are, NOT worth ""5"" stars.  EVER!!!  Please save your money.

7982154,4,B00008DP49,I received this film in the mail today and watched it. I have wanted to see this film ever since watching a three minute clip from it on youtube. I love the character designs used in this movie. Shaggy and Scooby look radically different in this incarnation but in a good way. They finally found the middle ground: not as superbly designed as Where are You but infinitely better than the nauseatingly amateurish stylings of A Pup Named Scooby Doo. This ties with Boo Brothers concerning great vocal talent. Casey Kasem gives his most enthusiastic and distinctive voiceover for Shaggy during his career. Charlie Adler is even tolerable here as a psychotic captain. The sound effect design is the best of all the franchise and the music is definitely some of the best they have ever used as well. The ink paint team did great with their broad outlines and flat colors. Kudos to the background department for their minimalist UPA inspired designs. The film boasts a witty script despite the first story being too long.,1493856000,,1015,4.7727272727272725
