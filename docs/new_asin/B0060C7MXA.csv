I would love to see this documentary - but $30?!! I'm on ssdi - who has $30 for this. Not a good way to share the abuse, which many don't believe happens. I'm hoping for cancer the pain is that bad - and with cancer, people listen, pay attention, believe! Please make this more affordable before I die.",1462665600,,434,4.240963855421687
8494460,5,B0060C7MXA,"This is an amazing film that will open the eyes of many people. I believe that even those who were not affected by mother-daughter sexual abuse can still relate to this film. This documentary is groundbreaking in the fact that this topic is overlooked and often hidden. Who Will Love Me? is a film that will make history and let survivors know that there are people out there just like them. A big thank you to the 4 brave women who participated, you are all courageous and beautiful women.",1320192000,4,490,4.51685393258427
8494461,5,B0060C7MXA,"This is an amazing documentary on a subject that few people want to address. It is emotional to watch these powerful women tell their stories. Anyone who helps others, knows someone who has suffered maternal sexual abuse, or is a survivor themselves ought to watch this film. It touched a deep part of my soul and I am so grateful it is out there for others.",1319846400,6,358,4.4393939393939394
8494462,5,B0060C7MXA,"I was honored to have attended the premiere of the documentary held at Monmouth University and meet these astonishing women.  What an inspirational documentary!  I was shocked to learn that such abuse exists, and at the same time inspired by the strength of these brave women.  They've come forward to bring awareness to all and help others in the same situation.",1319760000,6,363,4.918032786885246
