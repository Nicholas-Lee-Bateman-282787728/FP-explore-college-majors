8314559,1,B000GB72DQ,"This movie was not what I thought it was going to be. The audio and video quality is below poor. Even as a B-skin movie it does not meet the mark. Honestly, I could not watch the whole movie even skimming through it. I threw away the movie but kept the DVD case so that my purchase would not be a total loss.",1211068800,13,308,3.9047619047619047
8314560,4,B000GB72DQ,"I rented this film years ago on VHS. It was on the TZ Video label. The one thing about TZ video,was that they tended to edit their stuff. I had seen ""Emmanuel In Bangkok"" on cable TV and then ran into a copy sometime later on TZ Video. It had been cut to some degree. When I watched School Girls Report II, I had the nagging feeling that it had been cut. It still was a pretty good film with some substance. I thought it was an interesting concept, and seemed to be taken from actual case files. If you liked School Girls Report I, then I'm sure you will like this one as well. I will get it upon release to see if there is any ""new"" footage added, although the movie was good otherwise. The transfer to tape wasn't all that great and hopefully the DVD version will be of better quality. It has its funny moments as well as its serious moments. It runs a broad range of situations from Rape and drug abuse, to having your clothes stolen while having sex in the woods and dealing with the thief. That was the funnier side of this movie. Again it is worth a look for those fans of this genre. Charlie S. Richmond Va.",1189814400,42,1114,4.138248847926267
