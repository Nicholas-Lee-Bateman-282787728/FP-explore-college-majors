3945491,5,B002L9N4N8,"Watched the series way back in 76 when I was 10 yrs old.  Think it was Season 7 Ep Two Thousand that really left an imprint in my memory.  It is now 2010 and what surprised me is that my son 12 yrs old is now hooked on the series.  He had seen some re-runs on TV when younger but probably could not understand the plot.  I was surprised he got interested in this as he grew up with Ethan Hunt the movie version & I thought he might find this TV series archaic.  Regardless, we even named him Ethan after the movie's lead character (Dan, Barney or Paris did not appeal to us!) but I personally think the TV series has much more substance than the movie franchise. The opening Montage of scenes from the current episcode  with the classic theme song is another nostalgia moment so typical of the 70's shows like Space 1999. My son is also hooked on that tune humming it on and off.  Strangely, I failed to convert him to Space 1999.  What is missing though would be some Extras , Behind the scenes etc.  I own the Space 1999 box set and though produced much earlier in 2002, it comes with these and a SFX section on how the Eagle models were filmed.",1267660800,3,1147,4.177272727272728

TVDVDOutlet dot com, a Chinese pirate advertising on web, sells complete set for about half price but it is a poor copy from cable tv channel TV-Land.  I regret I purchase theirs which is not very good with bad package and long wait.

3945505,2,B002L9N4N8,"Bought this for a present. Tons of content, all the seasons including the 88 and 89 later seasons. My only complaint is the cost, very very high and the quality of the packaging. it looks amazing in the pictures, the TNT casing and all, but when you get it you will find it being very cheaply made cardboard, the fuse falls out and it's very difficult to handle the dvd's in their metal cases. it would have been better in a booklet. I can appreciate the design trying to be part of the overall intro theme to the show but sadly the quality negates that and is definitely not worth the cost for that poor quality presentation. If you want the complete season collection though, unfortunately your at their mercy just to get the discs.",1458000000,4,734,4.444444444444445

3945509,3,B002L9N4N8,"Some good. Some not so much. All are stored in the worst packaging from China ever devised. Some of the episodes are very interesting especially some of which starred Barbara Bain. Too many are similar and became boring to watch. The most common, at least so it seems, were of a bad guy who was the leader, or attempting to be the leader, of a foreign country with a weirdo name. This got to be very stale after episode after episode of the same theme. Overall there were enough interesting episodes to justify the price when it is marked down.",1451260800,,544,4.45
3945510,5,B002L9N4N8,"As another reviewer has commented, excellent packaging. Each season is packed in a hinged snap-lid sheet-metal case containing soft sleeves which protect the disks very well. The tubular container snaps shut; it seems to use concealed magnets in order to hold shut effectively. This is a fairly compact arrangement for storing so many disks.
Disk quality appears to be impeccable; no scratches, no finger prints, no visible defects.
The encoding is beautiful. No video artifacts whatsoever were visible on playback. The episodes seem to have been scanned from film. Except for the pilot episode, which evidenced some mild scratches in the print, all other episodes I've viewed were in pristine condition, the colours quite vibrant.
A much more entertaining show than what I remembered from having watches these originally as a kid some 45 years ago. You will likely have a much greater appreciation for these as an adult.
The first thing I do when I receive DVDs is to test them all for defects, as one must return them to Amazon within 30 days if a disk is bad. I use a free little utility app named ""VSO Inspector"" to scan the disks for errors. This must be used in combination with copy-breaking software such as ""AnyDVD"", or VSO Inspector will erroneously report all of the disk's sectors as defective. I tested all 56 disks I received in this set and found not one containing any defects or even marginally readable spots, so again, excellent disk quality. Note: Checking disks on a computer using the method I described will not guarantee that disks will play defect-free on a set-top DVD player -- a different drive may still choke on a disk which played impeccably on your computer's drive.
Very pleased with my purchase, considering that Amazon.ca had the whole set on sale for 115$ (Canadian dollars! -- which at the moment are worth slightly more than the Ruble relative to U.S. dollars.).",1450224000,,1900,4.885448916408668

3945524,5,B002L9N4N8,"i don't have this DVD set. i wish i had it. i had to download these on torrent because if i knew about these, i would have bought them. i am watching it now and i can personally tell you as a huge fan of film and classic TV, that this show somewhat has held up. but you have to watch it differently. considering the age of the show, you might think at first ""the show doesn't match the visual quality of shows today and it is old"" but that's not the way to watch. watch them like classic films. why i said that is because each episode feels like an old school espionage thriller. the acting and writing is REALLY good and on par with something you would have seen in the theater at the time. in fact better than a lot of shows during the era it came out in. Martin Landau is absolutely a standout and we all know he is one of the greatest actors of all time. Barbara Bain plays Cinnamon Carter so seductively. She is an actress of the classic mold. Greg Morris is instantly likable. Peter Lupus was good but he doesn't have too much of a presence on the show (but my assessment is based on the first season and i forgot how it was during the later seasons since i seen them as a kid where TV (especially reruns)was king in the 80's) Steven Hill plays Dan Briggs brilliantly. Speaking of the show, the score is also what makes this show great. For god's sake, the theme (some of the score) was done by great Lalo Schifrin (he did the score to Enter The Dragon, That alone gives him major respect in my book) and the care they taken to clean up the footage is top notch. the audio was definitely clear. I highly recommend Mission Impossible. As a fan of film, i highly recommend it because it is textbook film techinques sprinkled in these episodes and as a fan of TV period because this is one of the best presented materiai i ever seen on a TV show. I also like to add that i love how some missions will require different people so you will see a rotating cast. should you accept this mission, your mission is to buy this series ASAP and witness a classic at its best....this message will self destruct in...",1444608000,,2108,4.207407407407407
3945525,5,B002L9N4N8,"The packaging is a gimmick and easy to break.

But the discs are good.  0 issues so far with any of them and I am more than 1/2 way through them.  Good audio, good video, simple and fast menu structure.  Like with so many DVD products these days, I suggest you leave the packaging on the shelf for show, and move the discs to alternative storage.",1441843200,4,346,4.196969696969697
3945526,5,B002L9N4N8,"I watched this series as a child in the late 60s and got hooked on it again when I realized it was available on Netflix. However, when Netflix suddenly pulled it from their lineup earlier this year, I was in the middle of Season 5 and was pretty disappointed that I hadn't been able to get thru all the episodes. This was an impulse buy for me on Amazon, and an expensive one at that, but I'm enjoying it so I'm glad I bought it. In my opinion, the first few seasons--the ones with Martin Landau and Barbara Bain--are the best, and some of the ""hippie/pychedelic-era"" episodes are a bit weird and dated. But the series reflects what was going on in society at the time, which is interesting to kind of re-live, and it's still fun to watch if you enjoy the spy genre. This set is done very creatively. The case looks like a time-bomb, and it even includes the two seasons in the late 1980s when they attempted to revive the series. It would make a great gift for someone who likes this show.",1441324800,,990,4.2994652406417115

3945543,5,B002L9N4N8,"In 1966 MISSION IMPOSSIBLE premiered on television and this group of five people worked together like a well oiled machine to accomplish their mission my two favorite episodes are THE TOWN AND THE EXCHANGE. In THE TOWN Jim the team leader is medically drugged motionless in bed without being able to use any of his senses, except his sight, watch and see how Jim is able to communicate with his team members, and in THE EXCHANGE Cinnamon is captured and tortured, and the IMF(IMPOSSIBLE MISSION FORCE) has to figure out a way to save her. The enjoyable aspect of this show is that the technology expert Barney did not have the high-tech gadgets of today, he had to create and improvise on the seemingly ancient technology of the 1960s, and he did a masterful job of it. The MISSION IMPOSSIBLE of the 1960s is and will always be my favorite version to watch, buy this DVD set and see for yourself, I have two trivia questions for you: 1.can you name the actor who played the IMF team leader in the very first season, the answer is Steven Hill, 2. can you name the actor whose voice is on the recording at the beginning of every episode, I don't know the answer to this one I finally stumped myself.",1422403200,,1197,4.470319634703197
3945544,5,B002L9N4N8,"Packaging is unique.  While the outer plastic packaging did have some bends and slight cracks, the dynamite shaped case holding the disks was not damaged.  Personally, don't like the foam pieces that separates each season's can, as they make it difficult to place cans back in case, but they do protect cans from damage and are necessary The disks are well protected inside cans with plastic soft lined sleeves.  Haven't had time to watch but 4 disks of 1st season, but these were pristine and played perfectly.  Other disks were visually checked and had no damage, so I expect all to play just fine.  Look forward to watching them.  Only thing that puzzles me is that all photos of case in all promo shots opens opposite from the way case is hinged in set I received.  Tried to open case the way it was shown in promo photo and realized it was hinged on opposite side.  Assume promo photo was done this way to better highlight set contents.

3945545,5,B002L9N4N8,"Mission Impossible was the ground-breaking TV show whose legacy still continues to this day (I think the 5th installment in the motion picture series is coming soon). I used to watch Mission Impossible as a kid back in the late 70s. (on Turkish TV, the show was called ""Danger is our Mission"" LOL). I picked this up right around Thanksgiving in 2014 and the first thing that struck me was the picture quality. The picture quality is amazing. 5.1 Digital Surround Sound quality is also fantastic. The picture looks so good it is even better than some of the Bluray movies that I own. I own hundreds of movies (most of which are Bluray, many Criterion Bluray titles) and TV shows and I have to say this is the best picture quality of any of the TV show during that time and even after. Some of the TV shows from 1990s and even 2000s do not look this good. With that said, if there was a Bluray release of the show, I would probably buy it as well.

It takes a us while to get through this many seasons, but just wanted to say again what an enjoyable series this is. Our kids range from 15 to 22 and they all thoroughly enjoy watching it with my wife and I.

The packaging is holding up well, and while it doesn't necessarily fit on the shelf as nicely as a standard dvd, it just fits the idea of the show so well that it is easily overlooked.

The series is so unique in that it has almost no character development, as most modern series, IMHO, get overrun with.
It is just action, ingenuity, creativity, drama, suspense, and intrigue at its finest.

Original review:
Great show! Can't say enough good things about this show. Very intriguing, suspenseful, and enjoyable to watch. Very good mix of actors, who play their parts very well. Hope I don't offend Steven Hill fans, but I was glad to have Peter Graves replace him after he decided to leave the series.

This is a great and complete collection of this tv series. It is a must for those who remember this sixties, seventies and eighties series.

I really enjoy the ""Dynamite"" packaging as well.",1395964800,,1117,4.537313432835821

3945577,5,B002L9N4N8,"and awesome theme and incidental music! Top-notch acting from the cast and guest stars. Ahead of its time in a way as no title cards are used for the episodes. Love how there is absolutely ZERO interest in the characters personal lives, only the plot and mission at hand. Today Jim Phelps would be divorces, Rollin Hand would have a parent with Alzheimer's. Willy might have a wayward daughter and Barney might have a harmonious home life beyond compare. Love the teamwork aspect of the show and the sets at the ""Forty Acres"" Desilu lot are to guess at over and over again. I watched this with a young friend and they could not accept the validity of the show, calling it ""preposterous."" They want more ""reality"" when in the end a TV viewer should just be concerned with being entertained. All in all, the packaging is great and the price was right, less than a buck per episode. I am working my way through season 3 so perhaps my opinion may change by the time I reach the 80's revival of the series but for now I am all eyes and ears.",1388620800,3,1036,4.373056994818653
3945578,5,B002L9N4N8,"My parents have been telling me for years that the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible movies were nothing compared to the original series. I did not understand them until my mom bought me the 6th season of Mission Impossible earlier this year. After watching the first episode of that season I was hooked. I watched the episodes back to back whenever I had a chance.
Since I finished that season I looked for the complete series and  found it, but after seeing this collector's edition that includes the remake seasons of the 80's I knew that I had to buy this particular box set.
After the very first episode you will be hooked, sometimes I choose to watch these episodes instead of current shows on TV.  While the Mission Impossible movies are good, I do not think that they do the TV series justice. After watching the original TV series ,I totally understand the outrage from fans over the movie version of the series. I love the packaging, it is quite clever.

Hate when people say a show is far fetched its an.escape a fantasy a wish I could have an adventure like that, and this show provides that without the stupid 3 d effects there shoving down our throats these days.

I knew it was only a matter of time before I got to the one that was scratched by the tiny pieces of plastic. Sure enough, the next to the last disk is damaged. It's really frustrating because these were sold to me as NEW and now 6 months later it's hard to know how to replace this one disk.

8372494,2,B002L9N4N8,"This was a birthday gift for my husband. The discs are fine each season is in a round metal case....However, the dynamite replica to hold the discs is POORLY MADE. First set  the bottom fell out and was torn. Amazon did replace promptly after his birthday! :(  I realize Amazon did not design the set but, the manufacturer shouldn't have put such a cheap outer holder considering it is a collector edition. Amazon should should drastically reduce price for this set. I fear over time it will fall apart as well. As a matter of fact the inner sponge pieces to separate the seasons are all unglued therefore serve no purpose now.
Big disappointment with packaging. Cute idea of making a dynamite chamber to hold discs but POORLY executed and overpriced.",1491696000,4,751,4.7251908396946565
8372495,4,B002L9N4N8,"I love this show. It was clever sophisticated, and entertaining - and it still is. Other than the technology being old (I sometimes forget how much smartphones and the Internet have changed our lives) it holds up very well.

This is a great collection - it's all there.

The only bad thing about it is the cute container. It is clever, but it does not fit my standard shelves and the DVDs are not easy to get in and out.

If you are a fan, I recommend this collection.",1482192000,,468,4.235955056179775
