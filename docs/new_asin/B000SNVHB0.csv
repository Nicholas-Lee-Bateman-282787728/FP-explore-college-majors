8325721,5,B000SNVHB0,"In a moment of panic before attending my brothers wedding, I began to scour the internet for quick and easy to follow lessons to bring me up to speed.  Not only did I have 0 dance ability, but I couldn't even tell you the names of common types of wedding dances.

The video was great and easy to follow and after just a couple weekends, my girlfriend and I felt very comfortable being on the dance floor with everyone else.

When anther wedding invitiation came in the mail this year, a weekend refresher with the DVD brought me right back up to speed.

This DVD is actually fun.  It might sound weird, but there are so many cheesy wedding dance DVD's on the market, this one was a breath of fresh air.",1324339200,,702,4.287878787878788
8325722,5,B000SNVHB0,"I can't believe this DVD isn't on the first page when you search Wedding Dane on Amazon. We've been through four other tapes and they were all sappy and lame.

I like Daniel and Tiffany's other dance DVD's (like swing aerials and lindy hop) and I didn't know that they had made a Wedding Dance DVD. But I saw it on the ML website and checked it out. It's definitely the best Wedding Dance DVD out there. At least of the handful that we tried.

Seriously, just go with the tried and true teachers and from a good company. The others will just leave you disappointed. And that's the last thing you want when getting ready for your big day!!",1307577600,2,638,4.308333333333334
