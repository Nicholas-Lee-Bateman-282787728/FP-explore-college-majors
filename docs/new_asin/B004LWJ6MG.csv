4405153,4,B004LWJ6MG,"Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava"": Although compelling and well-acted, I have strong feelings about this film and don't want to create a series of spoilers. A couple loses their child to a serial killer and hatches a plot to exact revenge on the man who didn't get what he deserved in the justice system. Actually, I've seen all the 'banned' films, including HC2, Salo, Serbian Film, and I didn't have to put something over my face and turn down the sound like with this film. The moral I came away with is that I couldn't go to those lengths no matter what was done to me or my family. Looking at the man's face during the 'action' was very sad, disturbing and real.

***Possible Spoiler: There is something to being 'right up with the lens' to the torture and atrocities here that makes it worse. It made me hate the parent/torturers more than him for what he had done at that point, interestingly. If it came to it, hypothetically, just execute the guy, people, be done with it! lol. The twist ending will have you shaking your head.",1338336000,,1042,4.5132275132275135
4405154,4,B004LWJ6MG,"This seems like a remake of the French film 7 days although not as good and there are changes such as the twist.
I liked it mainly because Bill Moseley was so good in it and I love him as a villian. Jesse Metcalfe was not as convincing in his role as the distraught father although he was better than expected and fun to look at because he's obviously beautiful.
Erika Christensen's character as the grieving mother and was pretty convincing and desperate. The young couple have a son about 6 who is playing outside with his father and during the few minutes it takes the father""Metcalfe"" to go inside to get sun screen a van has pulls up and snatches the young boy,Metcalf comes out just in time to see this occurring and chases the van to no avail then calls the police..
They find the boy dead inside the home of a child serial killer ""Moseley"" who has a strange ritual in which he puts on make up a tiara and plays the song Hush little baby then terrorizes the child ""very ,very disturbing and creepy""..
They don't show any actual abuse to the child but the crime scene leave little to the imagination as to what has happened.
The mother and father go all rouge and take out the van that is transporting him to prison they cause an accident,get him then lock him in a cabin in the woods strapped to a table,luckily Metcalfe's character is a doctor so he can torture him and keep him alive even kill him and bring him back to life. I myself didn't see the twist coming and it was pretty shocking.

4405167,5,B004LWJ6MG,"All these ""so called"" critics don't have a clue!  Yes cinematography was a bit lack luster and the actors AND their lines fall short, BUT...The premise behind the movie was perfect and just maybe our 'justice system' should probably take notes!  I mean really, as a parent I can't even BEGIN to imagine what dark places my mind would take me to in avenging my child's tortured death if I were in that situation.  If you can stomach horror flicks, every parent should see this movie AFTER the kids go to bed!  Spoiler alert though...the ending kind of sucks. Simply because the 'parents' goofed bad! I mean a doctor, and he didn't do anything about the larynx to keep the screams from being audible?  They also should have gone from there to the hands and feet to prevent escape.  That sick tool needed much more torture instead of being able to escape and take his own life.  As a personal footnote: Comment or don't I don't care, I won't read them!  My opinion is just that, my opinion...and I wouldn't be swayed anyway!",1370131200,,1021,4.540983606557377
4405168,1,B004LWJ6MG,"I could see how a tragedy like this losing a child in such a manor would drive you to that breaking point **** SPOILER ALERT**** and you can realate to the parents if you yourself have children. But for it to be the wrong guy and the actual Child Killer got away without a scratch on him and the wrong guy being tortured whom suffered from amnesia so he believed what they said was true and he was only in there for tax evasion so he killed himself. That just out right sucked. The movie would have been way better if the child killer was the one who got what he deserved. To the writer it seems if you were okay with the child killer of a 6 year old boy in such a brutal manor was okay so you yourself are sick you should have at least let him have been the one to have been tortued just has he tortured the little boy because he did get a light sentence and the parents knowing in 10 years he could get parole. This country does not take a big enough stand on crimes against children there is not a punishment big enough for those who prey on the innocent, weak , and children. The worst crime in the world is to hurt a child and to know you can get more time for mail fraud then crimes against a child that is just an outrage. Prison is to good for someone who hurts a child it should be in those cases we would adopt and eye for and eye. There is nothing worse then having to bury yur child. So I urge you not to watch this movie the writer must have wanted a twist to this story but for 2 parents to have there child taken and then killed in such a horrorfic way and to hit their breaking point when he may see the light of day again even though there was countless childs size mutalated bodies in his back yard and one day he could be free again to hurt more innocent kids so to kidnap him and torture him to release the pain they felt from losing a child and then to hurt again to know you tortured the wrong man an inncoent man that is to much to bear and the writer is sick for even thinking that was okay that people would like this movie it makes me wonder what are the secrets in his house for someone to think of this story and let the bad guy win over grief stricken parents. Scary movies are one thing suspense is one thing but this is in a class by its self it is just sick and so is the mind who wrote it!!!!! I wouldn't have watched it at all if I knew what it was about a friend picked it saying They thought they had heard of it and we were both shocked and appalled. SO PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS, RENT IT, OR EVEN WATCH IT FOR FREE. TAKE A STAND AN HELP STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN AND TO STOP IT BEING GLOIFIED EVEN IN THE MOVIES. IF YOU LOVE CHILDREN AND AGREE TO HELP KEEP THEM SAFE AND LOVED THEN BOYCOTT THIS MOVIE PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU.",1367280000,3,2773,3.9892086330935252

4405170,5,B004LWJ6MG,"WHAT the??  The Tortured satisfies that secret urge most of us have for revenge, *especially* when it pertains to a little child being kidnapped and ultimately killed leaving the parents grieving and crying for justice.  If you DESPISE the idea of seeing what was once a normal, happy and innocent family suffer through several years of emotional sadness over such a tragedy, oh boy, you will *love* the Tortured.  Sort of unusual to see Erika Christensen -who plays a significantly more peaceful and rational parent in the hit TV show Parenthood- star as a ruthless mother out for revenge.  She really surprised me in this role!

So what's this movie about?  Imagine getting the opportunity to physically torture the person who kidnapped and killed your child.  Would you do it?  Would you torture the man until he's almost dead but make sure he's drugged enough to keep him alive *just* for the purpose of torturing him some more?  I have a feeling several parents would.  After the husband and wife spend way too long accusing and criticizing each other over who's to blame for their sons eventual murder, they come up with a plan to break that murderer out of a prison van, kidnap HIM and bring the man to a personal torture chamber in the basement of some house in the middle of nowhere.  From here, they tie the man down and strap him in real tight and well, what's the name of the movie?  Yes, TORTURE HIM AND MAKE HIM PAY!!!  Even Erika Christensen's character almost reaches a point of remorse when her husband gets a little *too* into torturing the man.

Oh man, I'm not even going to mention all the twisted and sickening techniques used to make the man suffer, but needless to say, you'll probably feel a little bit of satisfaction and justice by the time this movie is done.  Anyone that hurts a child is a horrible human being.  My only quibble is that the movie is only 75 minutes long.  Really too short and somewhat rushed in several respects all so the plot can focus hard and heavy on the actual torturing.  The ending was too quick as well.  I don't have a problem with the way the events wrapped up at the end other than -without spoiling it- words can't exactly bring back that child.  Small complaints since this is *unquestionably* a 5-star suspense.",1362441600,3,2274,4.609452736318408
4405171,4,B004LWJ6MG,I did like this movie even though there were parts that were a little too graphic for me. The end had a bit of a surprising twist.,1362268800,,130,3.8518518518518516
4405172,1,B004LWJ6MG,"Being a parent, I understand one's hatred for those who would harm their child.  Of course, many would want to torture or kill this killer.  Elise and her husband were no different from many of us with that kind of hatred inside of them.  Justice was not served in the courtroom.  How unrealistic to serve a killer with only a 25 to life sentence for the hidious crime of this child.

(Some Spoliers Below):

From reading some of the earlier reviews, I found this movie to be unrealistic at times as well.  Were they too full of hatred to not notice the man they were torturing as not the killer?  It would never be that easy to spike the officers drink with a drug.  Did he not wonder why she was standing so close to him without saying anything?  When did the so-called killer have time to get some paper and write a suicide letter for a crime he did not comment.  This was after his escape from the couple.  I guess from all that torturing, they convinced him that he did it.

The ending was disappointing for me also.  It made the movie twice as sad. Now we have a couple who's life are not only destroyed by the death of their son, but now they are criminals themselves.  These types of movies are not my cup of tea.  I fast forwarded most of the movie.  I could not watch or listen to the torturing.  It was more than my eyes and stomach could take.  The story was wrong all around.  Clearly, no one should kill another, and the killer should not be kidnapped and killed by their victims as well.  A sad movie indeed.",1360368000,,1523,4.255244755244755
4405173,3,B004LWJ6MG,"I used to always love watching those old ""Death Wish"" films, where Charles Bronson went all, well, Bronsonian on all those thugs.  Fun.  There were clearly the bad guys -- whomever Mr. Bronson was enacting his punishment -- and the good guys, or rather guy -- Mr. Bronson.  It was a couple hours of escapist fun.

Now, I guess that his films fell into the vigilante justice category, while this film falls into the revenge category, kind of like ""I Spit on Your Grave.""  Personally, I liked the original ISOYG film; I believe that there was a remake as well.  But the original was ""fun"" in the sense that, there were people who truly deserved whatever they got, and so you didn't feel much empathy -- heck, forget even the lesser sympathy -- for them and so you didn't mind watching some guy lose something of importance in a shoulda-been-but-actually-wasn't-horrific bathtub scene.

While watching films such as ""The Tortured,"" I always create a list of possible endings in my head early on, and then stack rank them to figure out which one is most likely going to happen.  And then of course, if I guess correctly by saying, ""This is what's going to happen!"" and then I am later right, I pat myself on the back for a job well done.  Perhaps that's the intent of directors and writers of these films.  But in reality, that's kind of annoying, because it takes away from the movie experience for me.  I spend more time thinking about plot than thinking about theme.  And this happened to me while watching here.

It seems that this film is making the same-old-lame-old you-can't-bring-him-back-by-exacting-revenge theme, and it almost works here.  There were issues though, of course.  1.  The dialog kept bouncing back and forth between the two main leads, who wanted revenge and who didn't, and each of their opinions seemed to change many times.  That was inconsistent to me.  2.  The movie started too late in the family's story, not giving us any reason to care about these actors.  3.  The movie actually was a little too short, oddly, at I believe only about an hour and 15 minutes.  I think if they would have added fifteen minutes to the film -- at the beginning -- this would have fixed two of their problems.

While the female lead -- Erika Christensen -- is actually surprisingly good here with the dialog and action she has to work with, I'm going to have to say, ""Don't torture yourself.  Take this film off your Wish List.""  I'm going to exact some revenge myself on this film for an hour or so minorly wasted, and give it a minor pass.",1359849600,,2551,4.603104212860311

You'll see what I mean when you watch this.  Horror lovers won't mind sitting through this even if it is just an ok flick.  I'm not sure its even horror, more of a suspenseful graphic crime story.

8434988,4,B004LWJ6MG,"This sad, heartbreaking and utterly disturbing movie is truly torture porn. What should you expect though, from the producers of SAW?
Unlike a lot of torture porn movies, ""The Tortured"" really can't be lumped into that category. It plays out more like a really gory and intense episode of TV's ""Criminal Minds"" than a traditional torture porn movie. The premise is simple. A child killer abducts a child right in front of his father, from his own front yard. He tortures and kills the little boy. Despite being caught red handed, but sadly, after he had freshly killed their son, he is apprehended. The killer pleads innocent but is found to be responsible for the death and mutilation of countless other child victims. In order to give the families of the dead children closure and under pressure from the DA, they strike a deal with the killer and he only receives 25 years to life. Meaning, he could be set free in as little as ten years.
Fearing that he could be set free to repeat his atrocities, the young parents of the slain child devise a plan to abduct, torture and kill their son's killer.
It stars well known TV actors Erika Christensen ( Parenthood), and the smokin' hot Jesse Metcalfe ( Desperate Housewives) as well as a gaggle of several other familiar TV faces.
The torture and gore are amped up to some very unsettling degrees. At times, I found myself literally squirming in my seat.
Though Erika Christensen and Jesse Metcalfe's characters are essentially the victims in the equation, their eye for an eye approach, makes you question, who is the real bad guys here.
I think this would be a great movie for the victims of any crime that they feel was unjust and the perpetrator was not fairly punished.
However, there is a major plot twist or in this case, a red herring that you could never have seen coming, that will make you sick to your stomach. I'll be honest with you, I'm still not exactly sure of what happened? You think you know because they show you. But then, at the last minute, they flip the script on you and end the movie cold. It leaves you with many questions and wondering what did you just watch? If you think the ending is as simple as they show you at the end in the recap, rewind the ending again to the revelation and then you'll see. I can't tell you what I think happened, because it might ruin the movie for everyone. However, rather cryptically, I will say, things are not necessarily what they seem and people might be more guilty of things that they haven't even being convicted of yet. See, I've already said too much.
""The Tortured"" is a good movie, especially if you like shows like ""Criminal Minds"". But, make no mistake.. there WILL be blood!",1464480000,,2698,4.553497942386831
