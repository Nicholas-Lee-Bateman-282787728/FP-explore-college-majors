8452387,4,B00516I0IW,"The Cleveland Show is hilarious, in its own way. Yes, there are occasional toilet and bodily function gags that are not to my liking, but on the whole I enjoy this show(suprisingly, I am no fan of FAMILY GUY). Cleveland's nasal voice is hilarious and likeable, more Hank Hill than Peter Griffin or Homer Simpson. A good comical everyman. Funniest scene is the second episode where Roberta's boyfirned challenges Cleve to rap and our man rips with the funiest freestyle on record. Nick knack paddywhack (see it and you'll get that last line).

HOWEVER, while the content is great, the DVD is the problem. You cannot navigate away from the annoying previews and wait forever for them to end before enjoying the episodes! Whose DUMB idea was this? That aside, its great.",1333929600,,767,4.8106060606060606
