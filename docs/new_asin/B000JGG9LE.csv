8150360,5,B000JGG9LE,Awesome!,1447372800,,8,8.0
8150361,4,B000JGG9LE,Very useful for auto learning if you have bought some of the other titles in the Trevorn's collection of books about bongos. Very instructive to see him playing.,1374451200,,161,4.785714285714286
8150362,4,B000JGG9LE,"Its a good DVD which gave me new ideas what else I can do with Bongos, especially the Bolero pattern.
It could be more detailed for absolute beginners but if you have already percussion experinces then it is well suiteable. The tunning part could be longer. Especially the explanation of the tunning details should be longer. All together a good DVD which is worth to buy.",1276128000,2,372,4.651515151515151
8150363,1,B000JGG9LE,"The DVD lacks exercises. Salloum talks too much. He does not tell you what is that he is going to do as if you are supposed to know the stuff. I wouldn't want him for teacher. He does not show much of anything, only few basic things that do not go anywhere. The quality of the clips from other players is poor.  The annoying rhythm seems to be longer than the portions that he actually demonstrates. At one point he states that what he is ""teaching"" is covered in his book, that does not come with the DVD. If so, the book should have been included.
Waste of my money. Now I have to buy another DVD to learn to play Bongo.",1257120000,7,622,4.098360655737705
8150364,4,B000JGG9LE,"If you're trying to self teach, and know little of percussion as I do, this is a ""Must have"" with ""The Bongo Book"".  Some of the explanations in the book just weren't getting into my brain.  This cleared it up quickly.",1183507200,16,218,4.2926829268292686
