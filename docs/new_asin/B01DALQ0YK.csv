8755410,4,B01DALQ0YK,"I got this bluray for Circus of Fear, I have already seen Five Golden Dragons and have reviewed that film elsewhere on here. this is about the Circus of Fear from 1966. We have a cool old movie and I think it is a hammer film Production, not sure but could be. Seeing as how this is primarily a mystery there is very little that I can tell you. I will say that this was fun and I think you will have fun too. The British cast is superb for the time and I really think you will enjoy this.",1494547200,,488,3.89
8755411,5,B01DALQ0YK,Great combo of Wallace thrillers. Afternoon fun! The great Christopher Lee and Klaus Kinski make for enjoyable romp in 60s crime drama. The transfers are good but not blemish free. But at under $20 this is a great bargain for collectors of what I call Saturday Matinee thrillers. Fun way to spend a rainy afternoon.,1488067200,,315,4.745454545454545
8755412,5,B01DALQ0YK,"two films on one disc.  If they did more of this more people would actually buy blu rays. That beings said. this blu ray has fwo films that look restored to me.  I actually own this blu ray and it's a good one. Circus of fear"" is a outstanding mystery movie and the other one is more a curiosity from that period.  The late sixties that is.  However this twofer is a good deal because that film is not that bad imo.  It's not exciting as many action flicks from the era; but it does have good performances and a rarely used location , hong kong And at that time the hideous Mao was still ruling China and was very much still a factor in world affairs.  Lets see MANY more twofers like they used to do on dvd.  Few people will ever spend 25.00 for a old movie on blu ray. but two films are a much  better deal.",1483315200,,809,4.0125
8755413,4,B01DALQ0YK,"The Blu-ray is incredibly good looking for films that old. Blue Underground keeps doing such great work in that area and i love watching those older hard-to-find movies when they look probably better than when they originally came out.

As far as the movies go, Circus was a minor revelation. I had seen a Pan&Scan Black&White version before which i did enjoy because of the story and Christopher Lee, but the movie just looked terrible. Here we have a pristine print in wide screen and color. I really like the story itself, if a bit convoluted of course, but it's very entertaining.

As far as Dragons is concerned though, i found myself yawning way too often. I was just bored. It could have been a cool action adventure, all filmed on locations in Hong Kong. Instead, the premise is tortuous, the goofy humor is off-putting, and overall, it's really not that interesting imho.

In the end, i would recommend it just for Circus Of Fear due to its fun story, good performances, and incredible restored quality. It'sa not a great movie, but it's fun, especially if you enjoy British 60's crime thrillers.",1472428800,4,1105,4.744791666666667
