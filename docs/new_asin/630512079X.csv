7884267,5,630512079X,"I first started using this series back in 2000 when I had to lose weight to join the Air Force.  I started with the Workout Challenge and gradually progressed to this one, which in my opinion, is the best one.  I ended up losing 27 lbs.  I recently started using the series again to help me with my stamina for Kickboxing and have lost 20 lbs. I've read other reviews that were negative and they seem to focus on the video quality.  I think that people have to remember that this workout was filmed in the mid-90's.  Overall, I enjoy the entire series, and more importantly, it works.  The Industrial Strength PT is awesome for days in which you don't have enough time to complete the longer Burnout PT...and the Deathwish PT picks right up where the Burnout PT left off.",1260835200,,771,4.432624113475177
7884268,5,630512079X,This is a very difficult workout even for people such as myself that our in shape. After completing the workout challenge for 2 months I thought I needed a higher challenge. This workout has half the talking and much more demanding workout repetitions. I only recommend this for anyone who desires to be physically fit or who wants to join the seal team. And to think that there is a third part of this series that is even tougher.,1211673600,2,431,4.468354430379747
7884269,5,630512079X,"This is a very demanding workout, for people who are already in good physical condition, who want to be even better. If you're not already in good condition and want a video workout to help you get there, I recommend Caracci's first workout video, The Navy SEAL Workout Challenge.
While leading you through the workout, Caracci motivates and encourages, and teaches you how to push to your true physical limits, way past the point where most people would quit or give up. It won't just make you physically tougher, it will make you mentally tougher.",1074643200,11,549,4.7894736842105265

I have been told burnout PT is very close to actual SEAL PT.  The workout challenge is a bit slower with a lot of instruction of hows and whys.  The Burnout is a bit much for me.  Deathwish PT is just nuts.  Seriously.  If you can do it start to finish, rethink your calling in life.
The Loti group produces several tapes like this one.  I would start with the Workout challenge and move my way up to Industrial Strength.  Then, if your still not challenged, Burnout or Deathwish will do it.
I also recommend Shotgun CQB.  It is a ""how to"" of using a shotgun in a defensive manner in a private residence.  Chris was a member of SEAL team 6 counter terrorism unit.  It shows in this tape.
Have fun!",1026000000,4,811,4.304635761589404
7884271,4,630512079X,"This is the PT regimen that I use in the house or hotel-room when getting to the gym is difficult.  In fact, it's the only instructional ""fitness"" video that I've found both effective and convenient.  Most of the exercises can be done in a small space, eliminating the need  for moving furniture prior to workout.  I really appreciate the basic  callisthenics of this program.  (I also appreciate the  ""eye-candy"" visual aspect of the video: C J Caracci is quite the  impressive physical specimen!)  The instructor alternates between  stretching techniques and strength-building routine with particular  emphasis on abs and upper body.  I would suggest a beginner get Caracci's  ""Navy SEAL Workout Challenge"", in which he demonstrates the  proper technique of each exercise.  Then, use this faster-paced video for  your burnout sessions.  After the first viewing, you'll probably want to  fast-forward past the introductory scenes of Caracci scaling a cliff and  get right into the PT program.  This video would get five stars if its  production quality were better.",963792000,8,1066,5.263473053892215
7884272,5,630512079X,"Simply the best workout tape out there! This tape works you to the ground! This tape is very ""Raw"" from a production standpoint, which makes this tape so GREAT! No dancing, No Models, No Lycra, Just a man with some  knowledge of what it takes to get in shape, stay in shape, and then train  some more. When the instructor ""Falls off the cliff"", it doesn't  slow him down a bit, he gets up, recovers, and goes right back into  training! Pure honesty with the veiwer, by the end of the video you feel  that you can acomplish anything. I Highly recomend this tape to those who  want a challenge.",946339200,8,592,4.336363636363636
