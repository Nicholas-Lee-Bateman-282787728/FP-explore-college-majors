3445933,5,B001A7GOE8,"We just picked up both volumes (season one's volume 1 and 2,) and my son can't get enough of ""Eon Kid!""  Marvelous animation, pretty good kid-friendly story line, and techy enough to keep the interest of a ten-year-old boy.  Two thumbs way up!",1242604800,,243,4.627906976744186
3445934,5,B001A7GOE8,"I enjoy the Eon Kid and would purchase the rest of the volumes when they become available.  The storyline is written very good and the cast is original, I highly recommend this show to all ages.",1240531200,,194,4.388888888888889
3445935,5,B001A7GOE8,"My guys (early-elementary-aged) both really like this series, and the toys that go with it.  They watch the two available dvds again & again.",1239753600,,141,4.875
3445936,5,B001A7GOE8,"It was great to find this available on DVD.  My boys, 5 & 7, LOVED watching the show.  When it was taken off TV, they were sad.  '

Now we are enjoying watching the shows again.  We are hoping more of the shows are released soon!",1233964800,,229,3.891304347826087
3445937,5,B001A7GOE8,"As usual, the amazon service was wonderful, and our grandkids loved the dvd.  Keep up the great prices and service.  I've purchased my professional books, Leslie Sansone dvd's (she's awesome!), dvd's for the kids, spiritual books and more-have never had a problem-that is GREAT
service-prices are great also!",1233619200,,308,5.395833333333333
3445938,5,B001A7GOE8,"If you have children who like robots, martial arts, or both, then they will like ""Eon Kid.""  A good feature of the series is that the hero learns to master his new powers gradually. The stories show that training and thinking are required; he doesn't become an instant superhero.

My kids (early elementary aged) like this show.",1232928000,,328,4.7368421052631575
3445939,5,B001A7GOE8,"Prior to receiving Volume Two Season One of the Eon Kid, I had never heard of the series.  I must say, that I am impressed with it.

The 5 episodes on the DVD include Orange Mama, Grand Wrestling Tournament, Fight Goes On, Escape From Orange Valley, and The Maxes Attack.  Marty (he has an iron fist), Ally, and Buttons find themselves in the clutches of Orange Mama and the only way out seems to include Marty battling in the Grand Wrestling Tournament.  Ally plays companion to a lonely little girl while Buttons spends time in doggy solitary.  To the back story for a moment.  Marty was just a regular 11 year old boy until he found a fist that he donned with dramatic results.  Ally is an 11 year old genius with a talent for getting into trouble and fixing robots.  Orange Mama is on the trail of the Fist of Eon, and once Marty has shown mastery of it during the robot fights, she wants it even more.  Marty becomes the most popular fighter in the ring, taking on opponents many times larger and stronger than he.  Will their escape from Orange Mama be complete?

As a more `mature' viewer of animated adventure, I enjoyed the simple storytelling and uncluttered artwork.  While the art is computer generated, it is not so overwhelmingly complex and special effect laden that it still lets the story come through.  While Ally interacts with the little girl, the pathos of the situation is very clear, and the art reflects that.  Even the sound effects and music are appealing.
I give Eon Kid, a clear powerfist to punch rating!

3445941,2,B001A7GOE8,"The first season has 23 episodes. We as a family really do like the series, we would like to have the whole complete season. Not just a teaser of 5 shows.",1223769600,,154,4.0
3445942,5,B001A7GOE8,"He's Got the Power of an Iron Fist... and the Courage to Master It!

One hundred years after The Robot Wars, a boy named Marty discovers the legendary Fist of Eon. When Marty tries the fist on for size, it gives him amazing fighting powers and Marty suddenly finds himself in the middle of a centuries-old battle between good and evil. Can the new heir of Eon - with the help of his robotic dog Buttons, mysterious friend Ally, mighty guardian Gaff and more - now escape the wrath of The General's dark forces and protect a legendary warrior's legacy? Eon Kid is packed with bounty hunters, desert bikers, battle-bots and secret agents. Experience the heroic adventures of the only 11-year-old who can save our world: The Eon Kid!

This single disc dvd release include 5 episodes from season 1. They are:

Episode 1 ""The Legendary Fist""
Episode 2 ""The Heir to the Fist""
Episode 3 ""The Journey Begins""
Episode 4 ""Strength Isn't Everything""
Episode 5 ""Ally's Secret""

The interesting thing about this release is that during the original US airing of the series (on the now defunct Kids' WB!), episodes 4 and 5 were combined together. That episode was simply called ""Ally's Secret"" so it's nice to be able to see the original episodes without being edited.

As for the special features, this disc includes a nice photo gallery, extended trailer for this series, a downloadable mini-poster and sneak peeks. Overall, the special features are better than nothing but I would have liked to see a behind the scenes featurette or episode commentary.

The DVD itself comes with a removable sleeve the matches the cover and the back. Inside the case, a single sheet ""Eon Kid"" mini-poster (different from the one that can be downloaded via the disc) is included and on the back, a list of episodes is included. Also in the dvd are stickers from the Nick Jr. series Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!

All and all, it's a highly recommended set and I can't wait for future releases.",1219622400,2,1952,4.723529411764706

They even sang the theme song when not watching the preview. Prior to my boys discovering it, I had never heard of the Eon Kid. So I got them this dvd from Amazon.
