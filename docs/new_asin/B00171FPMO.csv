8264603,5,B00171FPMO,"THE BEST TV LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOW.
PROMOTES LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT FROM WRONG, BELIEF IN GOD AND JESUS CHRIST.
HELPS YOUNG KIDS TO SEE RIGHT FROM WRONG AND LIVE A GOOD LIFE.
PROMOTES A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
SHOWS DRUG DEALERS THEY WILL NOT GAIN ANY THING BUT TIME IN THE BIG HOUSE.
TOO BAD THERE ARE NOT MORE WALKERS AND TRAVITTS IN REAL LIFE RANGERS.
TEXAS RANGERS ARE THE BEST LAW ENFORCEMENT IN AMERICA. THERE SHOULD BE MORE THAN 99 RANGERS.
I WISH CHUCK NORRIS HAD CONTINUED THE SERIS.
CLARENCE GILLYARD, NIA PEEPLES, JUDSON MILLS WOULD HAVE CONTINUED A GREAT SHOW. ALL TEXAS RANGERS REACH AN AGE WHEN THEY HAVE TO RETIRE, BUT THE YOUNGER RANGERS HAVE TO REPLACE THE RETIRES.",1222732800,6,697,4.721311475409836
