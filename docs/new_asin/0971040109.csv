8474470,5,0971040109,"Because of so much misunderstanding about ""Method"" acting training, I not only wrote the book Amazon carries, ""Strasberg's Method As Taught by Lorrie Hull: A Practical Guide for Actors, Teachers and Directors,"" but an Actors'Studio member since 1952,  William Smithers, some of my students and myself decided to produce a 2 hour video demonstrating some common  domain method techniques as a new and separate work independent of my book.
  In 2005, we produced a 2 hr. DVD, ""The Method with Lorrie Hull, Ph. D.,""  also carried by Amazon:  UPC:689076281522 and ASIN:  B0008EWRAE. The DVD is  REGION 0-viewable in ALL countries with printed and picture menus for easy access to any section.  The video and DVD  could also give more information about Stanislavski learned by myself and Dianne, my daughter,  when we were  master teachers at the 1988 Pompidou Centre Paris Stanislavski Conference.
  Elia Kazan's directing techniques are explained in all 3 formats:  the book [Part III], video and DVD.  My Santa Monica teaching partner, Dianne Hull, was discovered by Kazan who cast her  in a film and onstage. Dianne and I were privileged to have long directing observations and explanations from Kazan, the award winning, finest director of our time in our opinion. We teach Kazan techniques as well as methods described in our book, video and DVD listed above and sold by Amazon.
  The representational relaxation and sensory exercises demonstrate how we, who teach method acting and directing, teach the world over.  All the demonstrations have been used over the years by most Actors Studio members and method instructors [including Smithers, who won the Theatre World Award for the role of Tybalt in ""Romeo and Juliet,"" and the Obie for portraying Treplev in ""The Sea Gull."" William Smithers is perhaps best known for the character of Jeremy Wendell on ""Dallas,"" and guest starring on ""Bread and Circuses"" for ""Star Trek.""]
  I eagerly learned more about Stanislavski in 1988 from his granddaughter, Cyrilla Falk and from members of the Moscow Art Theatre, who had copies of my book. The book is also displayed at the Vakhtangov Theatre in Russia.
  For the DVD and video  William Smithers and I wrote  completely new scripts complementing  my book, as well as  based on his many years as an actor and also on our teaching method techniques. We divided the video and DVD into sections, so teachers, and others interested, could assign and/or work on short segments separately. As Martin Landau and Smithers point out on both works, ""The video and DVD  complement the book.""
  Additionally, the student co-producers { such as Daniel Val Verde, Cory Riback, Linda Watt, Regina Puksar, Sandra Butler and others too numerous to mention, but all on the credits) encouraged me to be on the video and the DVD  actually instructing  students in an acting and directing class situation. They wished to capture how I not only taught for 12 years for Strasberg and 5 years for the Public Service programs of the American Film Institute, but also how Dianne Hull and I teach today.  They particularly wanted to capture  new techniques evolved by me (mostly learned from Smithers and by Dianne from Kazan when she acted for him) which were not included in my book.
  Since Cloris Leachman had been a guest instructor in my classes for 10 years, we felt that the scene work guided by this amazing Emmy and Academy Award winning actress was invaluable for actors, directors and teachers. Hopefully, not only people in the honorable profession of acting, but also the average audience member will find Cloris' work with our students on the video  and DVD inspiring, enjoyable and interesting.
  The students at our Hull studio in Santa Monica claim that the video and DVD tapes are of great value to them as they work along with the film  as if they were in a class. People living far away from Santa Monica also claim the tapes guide them in acting and directing  training and knowledge.

  Others, not involved with acting, have written to us or told us that the video or DVD have  contributed to their appreciation and pleasure as audience members of other productions.  Lorrie Hull, Ph. D. One of many co-producers! All of us co-producers hope that others will find the video and DVD useful, as well as beneficial in class situations or as interested individuals.",988761600,6,4354,4.942068965517241
8474471,5,0971040109,"Until Lorrie Hull's 2-hour videotape ""The Method"" was produced, the only place one could hope to see the ""method"" in practice was in a reputable ""method"" acting workshop (and those are rare), or as a student at the Strasberg Institute, where tapes of Lee Strasberg teaching are kept under lock and key for use by a select few. Lorrie Hull has created an invaluable teaching tool for actors, directors and teachers which is also easily understood by anyone in the general public with an interest in ""how actors do what they do"". To read Ms. Hull's best selling book ""Strasberg's Method As Taught by Lorrie Hull"" is to understand the ""method"". To view this dynamic video is to experience it. No theatre library is complete without the inclusion of this video.",987638400,5,757,4.786259541984733
