Still controversial today; 'Love Thy Neighbour' would be indefensible if it wasn't so funny. The writers go to great pains to make sure that the black guy usually gets the upper hand in the juvenile pranks and schemes that 'snowflake' thinks up but there is an invective incongeniality to some of the confrontations.
Whether you'll be offended by this depends on whether you think childish phrases like 'nig-nog' and 'white honky' are acceptable in a comedy context.

What's really interesting is; the two protagonists are at each others throats virtually the whole time, except when they're trying to put one over on their wives. If there's a darts competition, a booze-up or a football match on the horizon and their wives are trying to put the mockers on it, they're suddenly the best of friends. This cynically suggests that the writers are of the depressing (but probably true) opinion that the gap between the races is nowhere near the chasm that exists between the sexes. But that's another series. (and another, and another....)

In short 'Love Thy Neighbour' is nave, archaic, sexist, horrendously stereotypical and rude.
It's of it's time (1972 -1976) and rightly or wrongly, commanded huge audiences when it was first broadcast. We used to sit down as a family to watch it, it was all innocent and accepted. But times change, and it was left out in the cold, castigated and reviled as the champion bete noir of the 80's PC brigade.

Now it's 'retro'. We've come full circle, it sneaks out on dvd, rising from the grave like a vampire. (a useful analogy seeing as the movie version was produced by Hammer Films!) We can laugh now, but in an ironic, post-modern sense.
And 'Love Thy Neighbour' is really funny whichever way you look at it. The white guy is an absolute buffoon, (he's a bit proto-Al Bundy, to tell the truth) the black fella is obviously his better in every sense, but is driven to distraction and despair by his infantile antics.

So if you're after a chuckle, and aren't bothered about the baggage, on you go, but if you're stuck on the politics - best leave this one well alone.",1219190400,,2223,4.778645833333333
