6097559,1,B00GOYHSTC,"The cover does not adequately portray the quality of the movie.  This is way below a 'B' rated movie.  Although I'm a syfy  junky, I do have to draw a line somewhere.",1406592000,,166,4.125
6097560,5,B00GOYHSTC,It was a great end of the world movie. If you like to see stuff like this it is a must have.,1405987200,,92,3.227272727272727
6097561,3,B00GOYHSTC,"I bought this because I like Victoria Pratt. It was an okay movie, but worth seeing to see her. She's transitioned well from the hot/buff period of her career to a really hot middle-aged woman.",1404345600,,193,4.542857142857143
6097562,5,B00GOYHSTC,I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE ON SYFY BACK IN 2010 AND IT WAS SUCH A VERY GOOD MOVIE.  I'VE SEEN A LOT OF TWISTER MOVIES BUT ONE ABOUT AN F6 TORNADO WAS SOMETHING TO SEE AND I LOVE IT THAT IS THE REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE.,1402876800,3,220,3.5833333333333335
6097563,4,B00GOYHSTC,"This one is kinda fun if you like disaster movies.  I hope people really aren't as stupid as some of the characters in this film.  You get out of your truck because it quit running.  You see a tornado coming towards you.  And you get back in your truck and try starting it again?  No go, then take off running down the road still directly in its path.  I guess that speaks to the writing and not the acting.  Still, I liked this movie.  I continue to search for another first rate movie like Night of the Twisters.  That one is A+",1400371200,15,530,4.117647058823529
6097564,1,B00GOYHSTC,Not a very good movie. I thought it might be because of Casper Confirm but I was very wrong. Don't waste your money on a poor script and poor acting.,1397692800,,149,4.0
6097565,5,B00GOYHSTC,made you roost for the actors/actoress as when fight mother nature.. good movie that kept you in suspense. will watch many times,1396137600,7,128,4.863636363636363
6097566,4,B00GOYHSTC,"I just finished watching the Movie for the 3rd time. I enjoyed the Flick. It was kind of slow and lame in a few spots, But to me the real story stands out. I have been thru a few Tornadoes in my day and I take the warnings seriously. Living in Nebraska, Its not Texas but we have our share of the finger  of God. I have seen people that do not pay attention and that scarces me. I am not a person that really agrees with Global Warming, But I would definately watch this movie again.",1395705600,7,483,3.979381443298969
6097567,1,B00GOYHSTC,"This is one of the worst movies I have had the misfortune to watch. My brain screamed 'turn it off' but it was so bad I had to stick it out. The plot is derivative, cliched and dull. The acting is wooden and amateur, but you have to sympathise with the cast given the deficiencies of the script. We see grief at the death of a boyfriend that lasts all of 30 seconds, then Brian, hurled into the maelstrom of a twister, is forgotten and we are ready for the next dollop of ersatz emotion.

The special effects appear to be of the 80's variety, with widely improbable scenes of a train being whirled into the air by a twister while two chasers sit and watch nearby with barely a zephyr of a breeze to disturb them.

The apparent hero of the movie does little more than drive about in, inexplicably, a Range Rover with low profile tyres. In Texas? Why? Apart from making weather forecasts and chasing after his children he does little else.

The nadir of tho movie is the series of truly dreadfully, yet hilarious, post disaster slo-mo scenes as civilians collapse about the place with injuries sustained for no apparent reason.

Best advice, don't buy it and wait for it on cable when you are suitably desperate or drunk.",1392336000,8,1219,4.452914798206278
6097568,5,B00GOYHSTC,"Actually a cute movie! The digital effect are staged and corny but it's a fun ""disaster"" movie. Came on time and was cheap. Love Casper Van Dien, he did some good work back in the day.",1500508800,,184,4.138888888888889
6097569,1,B00GOYHSTC,"This was the worst ever. I would be embarrassed to even say I was in this.  The Father and Daughter were horrible and stupid. When the Tornado hit they never even cared about the poor Dog never looked for him before or after.
The Daughter acted like she was 7 years old. Father ran around Mall have you seen my Daughter, like people knew who she was when the Son got lost he did the same. Waste of money and time.  If you want a movie for sound to take a nap this is perfect you can fall asleep and not miss anything. After the Tornado they are cooking, swimming laughing never looked for poor Dog.",1499731200,,598,4.146551724137931

6097577,2,B00GOYHSTC,"Lots of Twister copies from 1996 with Helen Hunt. Poor research. Guess this could be good movie for people that know nothing of Texas. This was obviously filmed in California. I'm from area in film and there is absolutely zero realistic area shots. Plus, Texas twisters come with lots of rain and hail--none of which is in this movie. This area in Texas is large and developed--not tiny delapitated towns.  There are zero hills and mountains and no palm trees. Roads are highways. Not dirt  roads. This is also an insult to Texas weather forecasters. We get awesome warning for storms. Script is lame. Mall (which is in California) locks  doors when twister comes!!?? Malls would not do this. People in Texas know what to do in tornado. It's not jump in car. It's not stand and wait. Kids in school basement?? There are no basements in these schools. This is a ridiculous movie.  Don't waste your time or money.",1482451200,,911,4.675

6097605,4,B00GOYHSTC,"A Christmas movie of a sort, F6 Twister stars Casper Van Dien as a misunderstand weather `scientist' and part time chicken little known for making inaccurate weather claims.  He has the misfortune to be paired with a less than agreeable wife/reporter (Victoria Pratt) who would rather listen to the expert advice of a TV station's meteorologist (Richard Burgi) than her overexcited worrywart husband.  Even when the twisters start happening at an alarming rate, his naysayer wife (with an obvious grudge) would rather ignore her husband's dire warnings.  Can poor Casper convince anyone that doom is on its way?  Can he salvage his marriage, save his children, the dog, the town, and make an impassioned rant about climate change/global warming/environmental abuse!?!?!?!  That, and a whole lot more.

As disaster flicks go, this one isn't terrible.  It accomplishes what the filmmakers intended, providing a requisite amount of entertainment.  It has a few fun moments.  Most of the dialog is inane.  The characters do stupid things and rue their decisions briefly.
I liked this movie because it had all the expected elements one hopes for in these types of movies.  One of the few instances where familiarity doesn't breed contempt.",1425168000,2,1234,5.213197969543147

6097609,2,B00GOYHSTC,"I LOVE bad disaster movies and this is one of the worst.  Why Hollywood uses names of real towns but shoots them in California, I'll never understand.  Tornadoes are dropping all over North Texas, but local meteorologists aren't noticing or reporting because it's December and not tornado season?  Most ridiculous premise ever!  Only the down and out climate scientist who was disgraced in Chicago because he had put out a tornado warning and they evacuated a town (Who evacuates a town for tornado warnings?)  sees what's coming and nobody believes him!  But I have to admit because I have family in the towns mentioned in the movie that were destroyed by the tornado I bought several copies just the the laugh factor.",1418601600,,719,4.852459016393443

8625851,5,B00GOYHSTC,"Accurately shows how your iPhone will NOT work in an emergency, disaster, or an attack.

For a variety of reasons Mobile phones won't work in a widespread disaster. Always have a backup communication plan, (amateur radio etc.).

A pretty good story with decent special effects.

As someone that lived in Texas for a while some things that stood out as completely wrong.  First, a true Texas accent is virtually gone in Texas, there are so many people that have moved there from California and other places it's quite unusual to come across a Texas accent. I wish I could develop one, women seem to go for it.  Newscasters in Texas never have Texas accents.
