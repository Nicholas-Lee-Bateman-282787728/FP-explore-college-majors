8742681,4,B018QRGMKU,"When a man is killed who has a coded journal of a drug location...killed by Amil Nitrate and Vin Dictive, this causes problems for their crime boss Alpohnse Dente. The journal is found by ex-cop junkie Mason Jars who is seeing the Donny Valens, the daughter of the dead man.  Meanwhile shocked reporter Anna Falactic is interviewing a man who claims he has proof intelligent life exists on planet ND 10835 circling Antares ""40 light years away."" (Actually 550-604 light years away.)
