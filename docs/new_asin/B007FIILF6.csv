5082418,5,B007FIILF6,"I have used this with clinicians to help them learn the language to discuss working with families struggling not just with RAD but other childhood presentations needing the SPACE approach.
Thank you ..",1377216000,,201,5.121212121212121
5082419,5,B007FIILF6,"An amazing and important resource for parents with children who have experienced early childhood trauma and/or have attachment disorders. It teaches an outside-the-box way of responding to these childrens' incredibly challenging behaviors that isn't punitive or shaming. It is based on some of Daniel Hughes' work on using playfulness, acceptance, curiosity and empathy as the basis of parenting hurt children, but builds upon it in a way that is healthy and healing. It also teaches some of the basics of attachment and how the normal attachments formed in early childhood are broken or damaged for many of our kids. A must-have for any adoptive or foster parent. I found out about the DVD through House Calls Counseling's amazing conference called Parenting in SPACE for parents of kids with trauma. It happens every year in the Chicago area. The therapist and therapeutic parent in this DVD are both involved in teaching and leading this conference.",1345593600,7,952,5.188311688311688
5082420,5,B007FIILF6,"I've had a girl crush on Christine ever since I found her blog welcometomybrain.net a zillion years ago.  She parents and blogs with grace, humility and humor.  Add  in the inestimable Billy Kaplan and you have a therapeutic parenting powerhouse.  Watch the video, then watch it again.  Drag your significant other in the room and make them watch it.  Order a pizza tomorrow night and... you guessed it, watch it again.  It takes repeated exposure and practice, practice, practice to get this down and make it feel authentic.

Celebrate your mistakes, accept your own imperfections and humanity.

Rent it or buy it, whatever your circumstances allow.  Just make sure you watch it.",1332892800,6,680,4.991071428571429
8515744,1,B007FIILF6,"The most boring tape on childhood trauma I have ever watched.  They talked too fast, did not give real life examples of someone's trauma experience, and made themselves seem like the most perfect parents in the world!",1527897600,,217,4.864864864864865
8515745,5,B007FIILF6,As a therapist this has helped both me and my clients have a better understanding of how to work with the special needs of traumatized children. Thank you for a great video.,1458259200,,173,4.4375
8515746,5,B007FIILF6,This is a great resource for anyone who is parenting a child with trauma and or attachment disorders.  The parenting styles would actually work with any child and if used your home will be much more calm and so will you!,1442880000,,220,4.365853658536586
8515747,5,B007FIILF6,"I am very skeptical of most of the RAD advice out there. And my kids don't have RAD, nor have they experienced trauma in early life--they were adopted as newborns. BUT so much of this video's wisdom applies even to adopted children dealing with the loss and grief and broken ""myth"" of the perfect nuclear family. The more I learn about ""therapeutic parenting"" the more it just looks like what I try to do on my best days, even when we aren't in a crisis. I would recommend this to any parent as a way of helping kids develop social-emotional skills regardless of their overall mental health base line. I would highly recommend it to any parent by adoption, regardless of how little trauma you judge your child to have suffered. Healthy, newborn, open adoption does NOT protect children (and the adults they become) from the hurts of that loss of the first attachment figure.",1437264000,3,874,4.645161290322581

8515749,5,B007FIILF6,"This is one of the best resources I've come across that is helpful for therapeutic parentingtrue therapeutic parenting. We are foster parents to a ""spirited"" young lady, and the combination of therapist and therapeutic parent is a winning combo for seeing how these tools can be actually used in your home. So often, we read and attend conferences that give the theory on how to reach these kids, but actually doing it falls apart when we get home and try and actually implement them into our daily life that is such a struggle!",1421366400,2,528,4.688172043010753
8515750,4,B007FIILF6,"Practical suggestions and ideas on how to parent children with RAD.
Liked the presenters especially Christine. She keeps it real.",1395273600,,129,5.5
8515751,5,B007FIILF6,"I love this video I've watched it several times and I religiously follow Christine's blog. We have three girls that we adopted from foster care ages 5, 7, and 9 they all have been diagnosed with RAD and our house stays pretty ""interesting"" to say the least. This is the hardest form of parenting that I've researched but I do believe that it's the best and that it's our girls' only chance to heal, truly heal. We fail miserably on a day to day basis but still our goal is to become better parents to help them. Those looking for help with your hurt children please watch this!",1386892800,4,577,4.351851851851852
