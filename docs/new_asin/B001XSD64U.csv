8347712,4,B001XSD64U,"I had been looking for a video to help teach my son, who is an above average player.  Not finding much on defense, I decided to try this video.  It was very good.  It had a lot of skating drills geared toward defensemen.  My biggest complaint is that it didn't have a lot of information on positioning.  Playing on a power play, killing penalties, 2 on 1's, 3 on 2's, etc.  Also, I would have liked to have seen instruction on body checking.  Overall, this is a good video for those players just starting to play defense and for those who would like to improve their defensive skill.",1258416000,5,583,4.342592592592593
