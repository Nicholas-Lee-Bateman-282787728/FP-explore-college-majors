7973918,5,B0000714DO,"I saw this movie in a theater in Hooksett NH and immediately raved to my friends about it. I kept looking for it for a year, eventually receiving information from Marc Sandler the writer/producer/star (after telling him what a great job he did with it) about it's coming release and I picked it up as soon as it became available. This IS Shadow Glories, critically acclaimed (info at [web address]) and the new advertising and jacket are deceiving because it's SO much more than a movie about 'the fight' CJ faces. It's a great character driven story, very dynamic, soulful (to steal fellow reviewer's words), and Marc/Penn's struggle to overcome his own darkness captivated me more than any other aspect of the movie. Incredibly well written, directed, acted. Once you see this film you'll understand my comments, this is far more than your average kick the snot out of 'em movie. I rave about very few movies, this is worth your time regardless of whether you're looking for action or for a powerful character driven story. One of my favorite movies of all time, as well as director and producer (credit also must be given to Hamzeh for powerful direction as well).",1041811200,2,1167,4.782178217821782
7973919,5,B0000714DO,"I saw this movie when it was in limited release in Maine, USA under the title SHADOW GLORIES.  As a 3rd degree black belt and a lifelong martial artist I've got to say its one of the truest, most soulfilled representations of the art and kickboxing I've seen in years.  I've been waiting for over a year to see it again.  Having kept tabs on the film via its website (ShadowGlories.com) I understand its won awards in Los Angeles.  The fight scenes are on par with those in Raging Bull, putting you right in the ring for every bone crushing blow.  But its the story, written by its star Marc Sandler, and Ziad Hamzeh's brilliant direction that make this movie a standout.  And wait till you get a load of Killer Kuzinski!  Gritty and unrelenting, I'm making it a MUST SEE for all my students!",1038873600,2,792,4.4206896551724135
