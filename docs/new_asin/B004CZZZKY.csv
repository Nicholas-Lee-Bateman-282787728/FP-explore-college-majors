4331147,5,B004CZZZKY,"Like the title says, Glad to see this released on a decent DVD. The transfer was very good. I am a fan of 50's Sci-Fi and this movie makes the cut. No review here, there are many reviews in other places.",1382659200,,203,3.975609756097561
4331148,3,B004CZZZKY,"Don't underestimate the simpler joys of a hokey film, especially if you're watching it with your sarcastic friends. Take 1961's Valley of the Dragons, a prehistoric sci-fi picture that posits this premise: In 1881, in northern Africa, just before the count of ten, two pistol-wielding duelists are swept away onto a passing comet on which surface roam primeval creatures... and gorgeous, scantily-clad cave girls. Can French Captain Hector Servadac (Cesare Danova) and Irish soldier-of-fortune Michael Denning (Sean McClory) belay their feud and work in concert for survival? Well, yeah.

The opening credits hullabaloo not once but twice that the film bases itself on the Jules Verne story, ""Career of a Comet."" But Verne-heads should be aware that it's very loosely based. It's too bad Ray Harryhausen or George Pal didn't get their mitts on this film. As it is, what we get are fairly standard cave man/dinosaur thrills. In quick order, our two Earthmen are attacked by laughably googly-eyed sub-humans and witness two gigantic beasts tear at each other. One glance at that looming satellite and we're exposed to Servadac's crazy scientific theory. That heavenly body hovering over them turns out not to be the moon but, rather, the Earth. Servadac supposes that a thousand centuries ago their comet had glanced off our planet and ripped away a piece of the Earth and an envelope of its atmosphere. Very much pals at this stage and seemingly very calm about their situation, Servadac and Denning munch away on prehistoric partridge.

Speaking of heavenly bodies, Joan Staley (most notably from The Ghost and Mr. Chicken) as ""Deena"" and Danielle De Metz as ""Nateeta"" make for fetching cave girls. We're in for mild tittilation during one underwater sequence as Joan Staley's near-revealing swimming escapade apparently had them boys at the theaters in 1961 howling and hooting. And if you're a fan of dusty old creature features, then maybe you'll recognize several stock footage lifted from One Million B.C. (1940) and, I think, Rodan (1956). That spider monster suspiciously looks like the same prop from Cat-Women of the Moon (1953).

If nothing else Valley of the Dragons reaffirms modern man's superiority over squabbling tribes of spear-waving primitives. If you were ever temporally flung back to the Stone Age, then rest easy in the knowledge that your ability to manufacture gunpowder and to teach the local brutes our good English language will serve you in good stead. So, thanks, Valley of the Dragons. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",1379808000,2,2536,5.135593220338983
4331149,2,B004CZZZKY,"Even by the standards of sci fi in 1961 , this was a silly but fun shlocker. Shlock movies do not try to be silly , they are earnest and awkward.  This is a good spirited flick of that vein.  Two duelists are swept up to a comet , which then flies into outer space. the comet is full of giant lizards and mammoths, and a volcano , because as one of the men speculates , 'the earth had much more of them when the comet picked up parts of the earth last time it came close."" Well , now you see it.  It's pure sci fantasy from the pulps of 1900. Which by 1961 , is amazing it was being made in films. But then , ""first men in the moon' was made a few years later and it was like this and a 1800's type of story too! that one was actually a very good film, this is what it is,  But this is fun. Of course there are sexy women with shaved legs on the comet! And Rodan from the Japanese film series flies by. (they use  a lot of stock footage from other films in this one!""  It would be easy to just pick this apart. But it's of it's time and not so bad in a schlocky way! So the other two people are right , this is a three star flick for them. As it is entertaining and kids back then could identify with the two heroes. Especially boys!  The cave and river women are very hot indeed!.  And they take to our heroes with relish.  I am sure at least five other films footage is used in this one. That's how low budget it was. But the earnestness of the actors is very good. They knew that this was not sci fi but complete kid fantasy stuff. And they did their best. Cheers to them for that. But this is still shlock. It's really dumb in so many ways. But still fun. I can put aside all that has come since this flick and enjoy it. But most people unfortunately cannot.  But then , even the very good 'first men in the moon' would be easy to poke fun of by todays standards. But they didn't make these films for today, they made them for then and in this case , they cobbled together several films to come up with a plot.  It's  what it is. And  if you can enjoy that sort of thing , then this is for you. I did get a smile from this. But dare not give it a three star as it is shlock.",1379808000,,2178,3.8456375838926173
4331150,3,B004CZZZKY,"I remember this film from childhood, seeing the coming attractions at the local theater for what seemed like months before it finally came. I realy loved this dino-drama at age 6 and have been searching for it on DVD for years.  Unique ""comet sweeps up two dualing men"" plot, with old stock footage of iguanas playing dinosaurs  from ""One Million Years B.C"".  Sentimental value only, but worth the price to me. An added bonus: Joan Staley from ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" looks much hotter here than in that Don Knotts classic, something I didn't notice back then.",1323216000,6,564,4.73469387755102

8424560,4,B004CZZZKY,"Entertaining, but silly prehistoric romp.  A pair of 19th-century duelists, one French (played by Italian Cesare Danova) and one British (played by Irish Sean McClory) are swept off planet Earth just before they plug each other.  It seems some sort of small planetoid side-swipes Earth periodically.  Now these two Earthers are stuck on Earth Jr. with dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, gorilla-like Neanderthals, cave-dwelling sub-humans and two separate tribes of primitive Homo-sapiens.  The black-and-white photography is crystal clear and sharp.  The Columbia Classics DVD-R is excellent quality.  Recommended.",1463788800,,612,6.058139534883721

8424562,5,B004CZZZKY,"I saw this movie available in a combo pack but opted for the single version to add to my collection of Jules Verne story's made into films.  While this deviates quite a bit from the original story I think its for the better.  This is a great movie for lovers of Dinosaur movies!  Critics could spend hours tearing this movie apart, but if you enjoy escapist fantasy you will most likely enjoy this prehistoric adventure.  This is by no means a B rate movie its just dated.  This is the kind of movie that would drive members of P.E.T.A. totally crazy, because there is a lot of footage of real lizards & alligators in prosthetic make up in real combat !!!  You definitely will not see a disclaimer on this film stating ""No animals were hurt or injured in the making of this film!""  I am no fan of animal abuse but this pre-code movie is filled with action & adventure if the sight of reptiles in combat is to disturbing for you to see you might want to steer clear...however if you can handle that then this is a great escapist fantasy film for a rainy afternoon.  The sound & picture quality are great, and this is truly a gem for lovers of Jules Verne's stories adapted for film!!!",1444694400,,1183,4.345454545454546
8424563,4,B004CZZZKY,"I love old black & white sci-fi flicks from the 50s & 60s era.  Most made precious little sense but were fun to watch, a staple as I was growing up.  I had never heard of this particular opus before this but since it had Dragons featured in the title, I thought it was a safe bet.  Turns out there are no Dragons and as for a valley, hard to tell considering the terrain.  The movie begins with an ode to Jules Verne, who they blame for the story idea.  It was taken from a novel titled Off on a Comet.  Whether or not they even bothered to retain any of that novel I can't say (I've got the book but as of yet I haven't read it).  In this case, two men are about to duel over a woman worth dying for.  As they fail to show said creature, we're left to take their word for it.  Thus, Hector Servadac (Cesare Danova) and Michael Denning (Sean McClory) square off, prepared to shoot the other, when a celestial body comes zooming by Earth, snatching up both men and depositing them on a comet bound for................?  To their amazement, the place is filled with prehistoric critters (cut and paste scenes from other movies).  There are also warring tribes of cave people.  Through an imposition, Servadac gets chased by a mastodon and ends up going down the lazy river, abiding for awhile with a tribe on beachfront property.  Denning ends up in a cave with another tribe.  They each claim a woman and prepare to settle down when an eruption requires they join forces.

The critics weren't kind to this feature but I thought it was a hoot.  It's exactly what you'd expect from a movie of that era.  It's low budget (they saved a ton on FX, swiped from other films, and spent nothing on their wardrobe!).  I quite liked it.",1438819200,,1724,4.334375

8424567,5,B004CZZZKY,"I ordered this becouse I saw a teaser on U Tube. I thought a lot of the old one million bc footage was used. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. The picture was clean and crisp. The sound needed to be turned up, but It was good quality. The footage from one million was very well placed into the film. If I had not seen one million so many times I would not have known it. For old timers I recomend this movie. You will enjoy it.",1400198400,3,447,3.869565217391304
