890012,5,6304490399,"I don't like motorcycles but I do like this movie! Bruce Brown's ability to wrap a viewer up in a blanket of entertainment is uncanny. He approaches this documentary about motorcycle racing and recreation with a zeal and  thoroughness that leaves you wanting more by the film's end. Featuring  Steve McQueen, Malcolm Smith and Mert Lawwill - coupled with a snappy and  involving music score by Dominic Frontiere (The Outer Limits series), On  Any Sunday is sure to please.",945820800,53,472,4.936708860759493

890016,5,6304490399,"This movie was a surprise on its first viewing, and continues to delight.  The film maker is able to capture, in spite of his documentary style, the joy, spirit and courage of his subjects.
At the time of its first  release, Lawwill and Smith were known to but a few ""hardcore""  hobbyists. However, the movie gave them, and other characters, an  immediate, universal appeal.  I was fortunate to see the film in its first  release.  The audience was comprised of many non-motorcyclists, not really  aware of the movie's content.  Most were surprised, intrigued and  delighted.",917568000,4,575,4.957894736842105

890235,5,6304490399,"I absolutely LOVE this Movie! This film has had a huge impact for me and my two brothers!
Our Dad is in this film! He was born and raised in California and began riding motorcycles at a very young age. He made Pro AMA by age 18! Sadly by the young age of 21 he went blind from complications caused by juvenile onset diabetes, along with both kidneys shutting down. Obviously this put an end to his motocross career. He stayed on dialysis for 3 1/2 years and eventually received a kidney transplant. After receiving the transplant by age 25 he lived the next 19 years as healthy as possible....while raising us 3 kids to have the same passion and love for motorcycles as he had!
We love you Dad!

P.S. in case anyone was wondering....his name was Mike ( Blindmike ) Orman. His # was 36!

I'm now ordering this movie for my kids!",1492214400,2,827,4.329032258064516

My old Husqvarna CR400 Cross and Bultaco Pursang models are represented in this movie.

I love bicycles, but know next to nothing about motorcycles, and I'm sure that the machine has changed a lot in the intervening decades. But this documentary does a fantastic job of sharing some of the exact same thrill and joy of riding that people experience today. I suspect that even people with no interest whatsoever in any kind of two-wheeled things will, when they watch this film, feel at least a hint of that same excitement and wonder at the world of motorcycle dirt racing.",1456444800,,643,4.6

891545,3,6304490399,"This was a decent movie for it's age.  Perhaps it was the subject matter, but it didn't quite capture the feel and magic that Bruce Brown's original Endless Summer did.  You could really tell they were trying to get there but it just fell short.  We watched the whole movie and enjoyed it but certainly don't anticipate sitting down to watch it again.  My sole reason for watching this was due to wanting to see the scene(s) early in the movie where the kids were pretending their bikes were motorcycles while racing each other.  It's rumored that this was essentially the first ever documented 'BMX Race' of sorts.  Not a real, sanctioned race of course, because it was definitely long before the NBL, ABA, etc and the height of BMX racing in the 1980's.  That was kind of cool to see.  Those kids were crazy too, jumping like madmen on their old banana seated, super-tall-handlebar bikes!

I'll tell ya though, that cheezy old theme song from this movie has been stuck in my head for the past week!

If you like motorcycles and/or Steve McQueen or want to see the bicycle racing at the beginning, it's certainly worth a watch.",1437436800,,1128,4.595

I still ride and race. I watch this movie at least once or twice a year and feel it is THE most classic motorcycle movie ever and will never be surpassed.

There are a ton of good ones and a few that are great, but for my money this one is the most natural, artistic and inspirational. Maybe that has to do with it being made in 1971, before documentary makers started trying too hard to make stylistic statements (although this doc is plenty stylistic). The two sequels to this are good but this one remains in a category unto itself. I've already re-watched it once and suspect I'll return to it periodically. This is a feel good doc about riding and about those who ride. I suspect most people will want to jump on a bike after seeing this.

892623,5,6304490399,"In so many ways this movie has affected my life.

One of the only memories I have of myself and my older brother doing something together is from going to see this movie at the theater as a kid.  From the first scene - a bunch of boys on old Schwinn Stingrays racing in an empty lot - to the last scene - three friends going motorcycle riding together, I was mesmerized. I saw my future in the movie.

Somehow, I think it made me what I am today. I raced my friends on bikes in an empty lot just like those boys;  The scene of the guy working on the parts of his engine to make it a little bit faster may be one reason I went to engineering school;  The scenes of the desert racing and all the different ways the guys and gals have fun riding motorcycles turned into adventures for me and my own son - Over the years, I've had to try many of the things depicted in the movie.

It affected my brother too - one time, many years later we talked about our choice to ride motorcycles and the possible danger from it.  We both decided it was worth the risk.

I have enjoyed the activities it stirred in me even long after I'd forgotten the movie

Then one day several years ago on Speedvision, or Speed Channel, whatever they called it, I saw this movie - and it all came back.  Although the movie is old now and I'm older too - the passion it invokes is just as strong.

Every once in awhile I pull the DVD out and slip back into the trance once again.  Reliving the enthusiasm of my youth, but more importantly the vision of the future I had when I was young.

It's a simple movie about motorcycles - but somehow it's about more than motorcycles.  It's about the ability of mechanical objects to tie to the human experience.

If you don't care about or hate machines it might not be for you - but if you have any hint of gearhead in you, you will enjoy this movie.",1404950400,9,1861,4.102209944751381

892630,5,6304490399,"I was lucky enough (and now am old enough) to have seen this movie when it first appeared in theaters.
I was enthralled from the beginning to the end.
Even ""back then"" it was obvious that this was a classic movie that captured a rapidly-changing era of off-road motorcycling.
In the years afterward, the Japanese and European dirt bike companies began getting more and more serious about supplying world-class racing bikes. Soon, every kid could ride what the pros had been riding a year earlier, and the technology continued to provide more and more of what the riders' skills lacked.
But ""back in the day"" when this movie was made, it was more rider than machine and to my way of thinking more fun and less serious.
No matter what your age, if you love anything two-wheeled on dirt, this movie will get your blood pumping and get your throttle-hand twitching!
Bruce Brown worked on a shoestring budget, but that only helped him to put more heart and less theatrics into the movie. What he had done previously for surfing (""Endless Summer""), he did again for dirt biking.
I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",1402012800,,1105,4.642857142857143

The film makes me feel happy and I can watch it when I can't ride and it helps calm me. Weird I know but hey this movie had a big impact on me like I said. Malcolm Smith is still my favorite all time rider. This movie is definitely worth the money and if you appreciate the old bikes then you should love this movie.

Great documentary about the pros and talented (and the not so talented) amateurs on the race circuit.  Made in the '70's, it's a throwback in time.  And refreshing in the sense that crass commercialization is largely absent from it's content.  Steve McQueen, Mert Lawwill, and Malcolm Smith are great.

Seeing what those guys could do on such primitive machines makes you really appreciate just how manly you had to be to do this stuff before there was a Monster or Red Bull sponsor to fly you around the world and give you a new bike and equipment for every race. If you like motorcycle racing then get this movie and really watch it and think about what these guys did and how different things were back then.

  The way he captures the personalities beneath the helmets, and the span of emotions within the racing world, can not be matched.

I now live in Utah and fly paragliders and hang gliders at the Point of the Mountain - the site of the Widow-Maker!

It covers Moto to Trials to Ice racing and everything in-between.

892878,4,6304490399,"On Any Sunday still holds true after coming out over forty years ago. This is the only documentary that covers all forms of off-road motorcycle riding in one film.  The bikes are classic, the riders are the best the sport had to offer in the early seventies, including one famous guy named Steve McQueen.  As a modern day motocross rider, I am a bit envious that i wasn't around during that time period in Southern California.  With virtually no regulations and tens of thousands of acres of available open space, this was truly the prime time to be a motocross or off road rider.  On Any Sunday does an excellent job highlighting the racers and the skill required in each unique event.  The stars of the movie are Mert Lawill, Malcolm Smith, and Steve McQueen.  Malcolm Smith was the top rider in a variety of different riding disciplines and the movie makes you jealous of his amazing skill.  Steve McQueen was one of the best amateur racers of his time when he wasn't starring in his own movies.  You could be lining up to your local race in San Diego on a Sunday in 1970 and Steve McQueen could be the guy right next to you in the gate.  Mert Lawill owned the dirt track championships of the late 60's and into the 70's.

If your a fan of off road motorcycles this is a must see movie.

The only downside is that the streaming quality is far from the HD we are all use to, but its hardly distracting once you get into the film.",1376352000,,1431,4.342105263157895
892879,5,6304490399,"I don't own this movie at the moment, and I probably won't order it because I'd rather get it on bluray if it ever comes out. But I used to watch this movie all the time with my father when I was a kid. My dad is a life-long motorcycle lover and he loves this move very much. It was a bit of a father-son bonding thing, watching this movie together was.

I used to ride my bicycle and pretend to be my favorite racers from the movie. It's one of my most fondly remembered movies.

If you like ""Endless Summer"" I'm sure you would like this one, they are both filmed in a very similar way, the narration is written the same and it has the same general feel. The premise of the movie is to just show all the different kinds of motorcycle racing that is going on around the world at any given time, On Any Sunday. It shows the different styles and presents them in a way that makes it feel very relaxing and pass-timey. The movie really makes you want to go grab a motorcycle and go for a nice, stress free, relaxing ride on a lazy Sunday. The social aspect is of course presented (the same as with Endless Summer) where you really get a feel like these guys live for Sunday, when they can leave the worries of life behind, and just go riding with their best friends.

Some of the people in the movie are weekend warriors, others are professionals, but you can clearly see that they all share the same love and passion for the sport.

Even if I never actually get around to buying it and having it on my dvd rack (I've seen it about a million times over my life, so I don't feel an urgent need to own it right now) It will always hold a special place in my heart and being a bonding film with my father.

If you are a father who likes bikes, and want to share something cool with your son, or even if you just want to watch a cool movie about bikes, you really cannot go wrong with Bruce Brown's ""On Any Sunday""",1374969600,,1907,4.101876675603217

I had initially been the Account Executive on the Yamaha motorcycle account with two Los Angeles advertising agencies and this is what got me in to racing. I met Malcolm Smith and Steve McQueen once at the Indian Dunes MX track. A friend and I had been play racing when those two got on the track. The blew us away and in a short time were about to lap us. I signaled me friend to get of the track and we waited until they got off. Who are these guys? We went over to meet them and recognized them when they took off their helmets. I was with Yamaha and Harley Davidson for nearly ten years. After my racing days I became an avid street rider and rode across America for the HD 75th Anniversary.

I have since owned a few motorcycles and ride as much and as often as I can. When I heard this video was being re released, I purchased it for my dad who got me started with bikes.

The video is great, quite an interesting look back at how ""real racers"" had to do it all themselves. Yes, there is a skill to what the modern day riders do, but not sure how many of them would have faired compared to the guys that did it way back.

I bought the film to see Steve McQueen. McQueen financed this classic film and can be seen in a few scenes racing. He was a highly ranked amateur motorcyle racer in his day and it is fun to watch him participate in races.
The film follows several racers on the circuit. There is a lot of racing footage which in many ways is more thrilling that race car films. These men are risking their lives with little protection in the pursuit of a dream of winning. The constant ""wipe outs"" are right out of AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS but these are not stunts. It's amazing to see these guys getting back on their bikes and continuing their grueling races. It's fun to watch. There is not a lot of technical jargon or background--it's just a story about motorcycle racing. The movie ends with a delightful scene of McQueen and two buddies just out for a fun ride. If only life could be that enjoyable,
If you are a Steve McQueen fan, be sure to get the two disc version with extras. There is a heartwarming tribute video to Steve McQueen that shows a lot of outtakes and behind the scenes stories of McQueen.",1345420800,2,1249,4.530973451327434

893424,5,6304490399,"On Any Sunday
by Bruce Brown

Every kid needs a hero. Movies and sports work hard to supply.

Adults seek people to respect. Talent, humility, and integrity are fine beginnings.

Bruce Brown became known for his visually arresting surfing documentary Endless Summer. His camera captured the same sense of danger--and the people who respond to it--in another of film titled On Any Sunday. Much of it was shot at motorcycle competitions that were held over many weekends. It is colorful, and noisy--and quite instructive.

Viewers follow American Motorcycle Association Championship contender Mert Lawwill as he drives his van full of Harleys to dirt and road courses across America seeking to again earn the AMA championship laurels. Brown's film makes it plain that this is a lonely journey, filled with long hours, hard work and few luxuries. As we watch, it is impossible not to be impressed with the quiet, determined Lawwill.

As it happens, Lawwill also has a famous riding friend and supporter in movie star Steve McQueen. McQueen had established his riding bona fides (on-screen and off) in The Great Escape. Here in On Any Sunday we see him riding in local enduros and desert runs under a false name in order to stay under the radar of other riders and the studio bosses who didn't want their investment damaged.

Almost incidentally, we are introduced to a third character who rides with McQueen. At the time, Malcolm Smith was only known to those who followed Trials-type competitions. In Trials, riders compete, one at a time, against the clock over an extremely difficult obstacle course. Only the best ride trials. Successful competitors need patience, judgment, strength, and imagination to win. Malcolm Smith is an International Trails champion.

From the moment the slight, bespectacled, quiet Smith rides into the picture, you know that Brown has found a ""natural"" and the story moves from Lawwill and McQueen to this extraordinarily gifted rider. Brown is obviously awe-struck too as the tone of his very engaging narration reflects. He has crafted a film that allows us to cheer for three quite different characters, each of whom is striving toward a different goal in this dangerous and very exciting sport.

Those of us who watched this film in the theater when it first came out expected to see a movie about a movie star who was one of us and an AMA Champion. Not surprisingly, forty years later, riders remember it as the movie about the extraordinary Malcolm Smith; even today, a hero who does not disappoint.

I can't leave this commentary without relating a recent personal experience. I was being interviewed in my cluttered office by a reporter from the Providence Journal. At the conclusion of the formal interview, just as he was leaving the young man inquired about the posters on the walls. I explained to him that I had posters or pictures of the five men whom I most admired. Some he recognized but others he didn't so he asked me to identify all five. I replied, ""In the realm of the arts, there are William Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, and Giuseppe Verdi. And in the world of motorsports: Juan Manuel Fangio and Malcolm Smith."" Sad to say that young interviewer had never heard of Malcolm Smith.

But you have, and through the magic of the VCR or CD/DVD player, you can watch On Any Sunday as often as you desire.

Bruce Brown teamed with Steve McQueen, and their love of motorcycles and film-making produced a movie of rare style, vision, and heart.

The word went out that there was this movie that the makers would like to have reviewed by some real racers.  So many of us convened at the old Sacramento Memorial Auditorium for a private showing of the film.  We then were asked to rate it.  (I was surprised, but not that surprised to see a guy who had been a temporary guest at our house in the Steve McQueen MX section, leading Mr. McQueen - (the one with the tire marks on the yellow jersey whose initials are JH))!  So we all gave it our approval and the rest is history.  Later, at the 1971 Saddleback Park InterAm, (or Trans AMA by then) the filmakers took a parade lap in a dune buggy before the race started - in silence.  I was there for that too.  30 plus years later, I saw the film again and thought that it was a little condescending to everything but professional AMA racing, poking a lot of fun at the grassroots - sportsman riders.  But regardless of that, this film represents a historical document when MX was quickly becoming a popular race form in the U.S. It is good to have it as it is, but it would have been even better if more personalities of the day had been included rather than focusing on a handful of favorites.  (I always liked Steve McQueen, but he was not a champion racer ever).  But I don't wish to look back into a gift-horses mouth, we are fortunate to have ANY film from that period - and a sort of arbitrary McQueen document also exists because of this film.

My father was a professional Flat track racer in the Midwest for over 45 years, and he only recently retired from racing at the age of 63. I literally grew up with the racers and their families in this film and I had the priviedge of being my dads motorcycle mechanic during each race we were at. I got my AMA mechanics lisence at the age of 16 and this allowed me to be in the ""PITS"" with all the racers and their teams. I was the only girl mechanic at that time, and I remember very well waiting in line before the races with Dick Mann on one side of me and Jay Springsteen on the other...... this movie brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it. I miss those days so much.... The life of a biker family is a special one and this AWESOME FILM captures all the smells and tastes and feels of the race track and the wonderful people who race and live to enjoy the sport of flat track motorcycle racing. If you love any type of motorcycles, whether just riding or racing, there is no other movie that will ever compare to this original version of ""ON ANY SUNDAY"".",1127606400,30,1169,4.154185022026431
893627,5,6304490399,I have looked a long time for this movie. Saw it at the movies  3 times when it first came out and haven't seen it any where since. Any one who loves motorcycle racing will love this movie.,1121990400,2,189,3.973684210526316
893628,5,6304490399,"From what I have read, not many of the reviewers saw this movie when it was first released. I did. I saw it at the Drive-In about 8-10 time, yes Drive-In Movies. I've seen it about.... 30 times, atleast. It remains fresh and new. I remember these guys, guess I've dated myself.

In short if you die not having seen this film, well, sorry about that. You die.",1119225600,2,358,4.264705882352941
893629,5,6304490399,"This documentary style snapshot of motorcycling culture of the 1970's is inspiring.  It makes you want to ride, and for me it makes me yearn for times when motorcycles were simpler, liability was less of a concern, and fewer people populated the earth (so riding areas  were easier to find).

This is an important film to have watched to impress your friends with esoteric knowledge of a time period in which you did not even live!",1115769600,3,431,4.644736842105263
893630,5,6304490399,"Please, please, please buy this movie as a gift to yourself.  Once you've seen it you'll probably buy it for many others.  It makes an extremely inexpensive and extremely enjoyable gift for anyone.

My wife is the person least interested in motorcycles in the world.  She absolutely loves this movie, along with my 17-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter.  My 5-year-old twin daughters love it most of all.  They call it the ""voom-voom-movie"" because that's the first sound you hear.

Everyone from grandma to motorcyle freaks to babies will love this film.

It is so much more than just a motorcycle movie.  It's about the love of leisurely and competitive motorcycling all around the world.  It's about the only superstar actor ever who was a bona-fide competitive motorcycle racer, Steve McQueen.  It's about $2.00 parts costing tens of thousands of dollars in prizes.  It's about paying for the love of a sport with your life.  It's about the poetry of a group of cyclists going incredible speeds within inches of each other.  It's about taking a ride on the beach or on a horse trail with your buddies.

It has an original and very catchy 70's sound track which you'll never forget.

I give this movie ten stars.  It's the all-time top under-rated film in my opinion.",1099526400,37,1273,4.819444444444445

893632,5,6304490399,"This is a good video by Bruce Brown Films. I Purchased this because I was allready getting into motorcycles and recently purchased a Honda Shadow. Music was a bit out-dated, but strangely enough, I now hum some of the musical themes from the movie.  (Very Carpenderish type 70's music).  I enjoyed the movie and found myself replaying it over 10 times and it is always nice to come back to it again. I especially liked the last bit at the end where all three bikers are riding around what appears to be a desert area near the coast of California.  The music meshed nicely with this part and that old Hammond B3 Organ.  The video is a good history account of racing in late 60's early 70's.  The theme of the movie appears to be that Motorcycles are both fun and dangerous, and shows the variety of racing approaches to the sport.",1073952000,19,829,4.427631578947368
893633,5,6304490399,"That's what I was thinking as I watched this movie.  Sure, the music is corny, but the footage is fantastic!  It had me itching to get my bikes out of the garage.  The movie awakens that urge to compete!  A really superb film-if you love motorcycles, then you'll love this!  (Just don't watch it when you can't ride, I did and had spring fever big time from it!)",1052265600,,362,4.264705882352941
893651,5,6304490399,"What can anyone say about this movie except that it is the definitive documentary about American motorcycle racing circa-1970, before big-bucks changed the sport.  Regular guys like Mert Lawill driving along in his Ford Econoline van with his racing bike in the back.  On the way to a race they would stop and test their bikes on farmer's side roads!  Nowadays racers ride around in Gulfstream jets and their (many) race bikes are hauled around in huge corporate-sponsored semi trucks. As an airline pilot, I frequently fly over what's left of the old San Jose Fairgrounds and I always remember seeing my first Mile there in 1977--the dirt clods from the racer's back tires flying through the cyclone fence at turn one where we were standing!  A must-have, especially now that it's on DVD.",1018828800,12,789,4.865671641791045
893652,5,6304490399,"Excellent documentry on motorcycle racing and recreation in 1971.  Although contemporary competition is faster, the footage of 1970-era machines is still exciting to watch in this movie.  Several well-known racers are featured, and Steve McQueen appears in much of the movie, participating in desert and enduro competitions, displaying respectable riding skills.  Flat track, dirt and desert racing dominate the film, but other forms of competition such as hill climbs, trials, drag, and road racing are included.  There's a lot of excellent footage and it's well put together to provide an entertaining film for motorcycle enthusiasts.",996278400,7,636,5.663157894736842
893653,5,6304490399,"My nostrils burning of sweet 'Blenzol'; vibrations in the pit of my stomach as the riders ready at the starting line. (My ex-late husband was a ""motocross racer"" among other stuff; so I saw it all) He and his pals soaked up renewed energy after seeing the movie; hence, our friends and we drove, bikes in tow, to the Cal Am in Sacramento or any other track or bunch of hills containing mud, dirt, sand, whatever ON ANY/EVERY SUNDAY! (every weekend I rode equipped with boots, gloves, helmut, pads on every corner of my body, kidney belt; tear off's if we played in the mud puddles over in Coyote Hills area; so I related on a personal level) The camera follows Mert and Malcolm and a great bunch of guys through six different kinds of competition. Mert Lawill and Malcolm Smith hang out with Steve and you see the bond and respect they developed over the years.  The DVD is excellent.  For every soul whose ever sat on a unicycle or a bicycle, tricycle,  Yamaha, Bultaco, Honda, or scooter. Seeing it last night brought back my youth; not the grandmother I am. Bad days and dissapointment abound, when I see Jim Rice come back and try to finish the race, it kills me. Riders soak off their casts weeks early to complete....dedication or nut cases; I'm still not sure.  Camera shots of ice racing in Canada with two inch spikes spinning at 120mph.  Spanish trials, 0-1mph; tons of fun. Guaranteed to excite the whole family.  The Widow Maker Run is one of the funniest clips.  ""G"" for GGGGRRREAT.",986774400,8,1495,4.5559701492537314
893654,5,6304490399,"On Any Sunday is, simply put, one of the best sports documentaries ever produced.  It was one of the first movies I saw as I kid, and since then I have watched it whenver I can. Affectionate and witty, OAS gives a clear overview of the sport of motorcycle racing, showing the both its beauty and its brutality.  We see motocross, speedway, dirt bikes, desert racing, superbikes, ice racing, hill climbing and trials riding, plus a few things I probably forgot.
Of course, the film was shot about 30 years ago (it can't be that long!) so it only shows the sport as it existed in 1970 or so, but as snapshot of a time and a group of people, it is nothing less than brilliant.
When I saw it was out on DVD I pounced immediately.  The only quibbles I have are with the opening titles (cheesy 80's-vintage video) and the sound.  The narrator's voice only comes out of the left speaker.  Still, considering that this was not produced in dolby surround sound, it's a very minor complaint.",978393600,13,981,4.4581005586592175
893655,5,6304490399,"On Any Sunday is an outstanding effort by Burce Brown.  It combines motorcycle action, humor and an indepth look at the exciting and sometimes dangerous world of professional motorcycle racing.  Having recently seen it  again for the first time in almost 30 years, I was inspired to write a  letter to Mert Lawwill thanking him for some wonderful memories of my own  dirt bike riding days and the Harley I owned.  In turn, he wrote me back  and included an autographed copy of him hanging it out sideways on a flat  track in his hay day.  What a great deal.  My wife even enjoyed it enough  to watch it with my twice in the two days we rented it.  Rent it, buy it,  watch it.  You'll enjoy it!",961977600,36,693,4.3125

There are minute indications in the DVD that  the film stock was starting to deteriorate, thank God it was rescued for  posterity by DVD.
