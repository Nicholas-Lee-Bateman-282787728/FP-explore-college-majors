1835172,4,B00008DDUY,"This movie is actually really good. The acting is amazing. The direction is good, the script is well done, the dialouge is also very convincing. Although I was young in the mid 80's (I was about seven or eight) I rember from the music videos and from how older kids dressed that this movie captured that era perfectly. This movie is extreemly authentic. Being a drug dealer was a lot easier in the 80s than it is now. Less competation, less attention from the cops, etc. Also Cocaine was not nearly as plentiful and was thus much more expensive....The star of this film plays Avon Barksdale on the HBO series ""The Wire"". In this movie he is a lot nicer than he is on the wire, more of a buisness man and less of a gangster. Michael Phifer, who plays Mitch, is practaclly a staple now of any movie invovling the hood but he is defintly a good actor. Nither ""Avon"" or Phifer give their best perfomances in this movie but they are both solid. However, Camron is amazing. I know, I know, he had the juiceist, easiest part, the least complex character, etc. However, no one can say he did not impress in this movie, he blew me away! Wow! And I did not even know that was Camron until the ending credits, the whole movie I was thinking, who is this guy, how come I have never heard of him before, etc. Only when I read the credits did I know who he was, I did not Camron was so big and diseal. He has unbelivable screen presence, the viewer canot take their eyes off of him. He outacts everyone is this movie. Even though he had a less challanging role than everyone else in the film that does not change the fact that his performance was incrediable. Not since Tupac Shakur died have I seen an a rapper act that well. (Dont get me wrong, he does not compare to Tupac, but he is the closest thing we currently have in terms of acting ability)I really cant say enough good things about his perfomance, so convcing as the loudmouth, obnouxious, but incredibly dangerous gangster. His only weakness his overconfidence and love of the spot light. What a character contrast to ""Avon"" the the guy who played Ace in this movie. Ace was smarter than Rico though and thats why he managed to avoid jail while Rico got played. I liked the ending too, the kidnapping out of nowhere was great, showing that just because these guys are drug dealers does not mean they are the only low lives in the hood. All three main characters paid the price for all the easy money they made, no one gets off unscatheed although justice certainly does not prevail. Ace goes on the be a legitimate entrapuner, although he got his foot in the door with blood soaked drug money, but hey, thats life. If Ace had stayed at the laundry he would have been poor for ever, he did what he had to do to benefit himself, however, he caused untold misery doing it. Life is no fairytale and taking the moral highground will result in poverty and hopelessnes. However, choosing the dark path of narcotics sales results in a parinoid existence of betrayal, murder, and incarceration. Their are no easy choices or clear moral distinctions in this movie, this movie is the truth!",1060128000,6,3127,4.44
1835173,5,B00008DDUY,"This movie was shocking, realistic, and that's all that mattered to me. If you enjoyed Empire, then you'll love this one as well!",1056499200,5,129,4.6521739130434785
1835174,5,B00008DDUY,"One of the reviewers from D.C. said two things I want to comment on:
*First he said in d.c. they weren't driving saab's, well in NJ and NY, everyone was trying to get their hands on a saab.  Saab's and Audi's were the thing, and even volvo's were making a come back. Ballers or drug dealers had them, or pushed to buy'em.
*Second, the clothes were also on point.  Who ever picked the clothes, etc. were so on point it was pathetic.  Back in the day if you weren't making money, that's what you wore.
And when they were all making money, they dressed just like that. Girls were wearing Fendi this, and Gucci that, and guys were dressing back then.  No Tee Shirts, and jersey's or army fatigues like they do now with $15-$20,000 in their pockets.
That movie made me cry in the theater and thereafter.  I really had to pull it together.  It reminded me of my brother.  My brother was Mitch, all the way.  From the clothes, and everything else.  It was exactly like that for us here in NJ.
There wasn't one scene in that movie that differed.  Even when their friend turned on them and got jealous, it was the exact same way.  As a matter of fact, Mitch died in the same manner that my brother died, at the hands of his boy.  His own friend that he was there for.  That's just how it was, with street codes, and crazies that went against the street codes, and those who lived by them. Everybody made money except the crackheads and dope feins.  Yep, that's how it was.
And as usual it ended when you had enough of it, and you had enough when someone close to you died and it scorned your heart. (although some went to jail or were killed.)
Paid In Full was right on time, and the song was the establishing touch, as we all said we were getting, ""Paid in full.""",1055721600,15,1755,4.246987951807229

1835176,4,B00008DDUY,"This indeed has to be the best inner city gangsta flick since Menace II Society, Clockers and New Jack City.  The fact that Damon Dash had anything to do with it, makes this even more astonishing.  Anyway I've been a big Wood Harris and Mekhi Phifer fan for years so it was good to see these brothers hook up.  Cam'ron did well playing his part eventhough I thought his part didn't take a whole lot of skill to do.  Anyway, I enjoyed the film very much and would recommend this to anyone who loves inner city gangsta movies.  The problems I had with the film were small and minor.  Like those up to date cell phones in a pre-minute cell phone era (1985-1986).  Man, cell phones then were the size of standard size 900 MHZ cordless telephones.  Dem joints were huge back in those days.  As far as the convertible SAAB's go, well let's just say that ballers here in DC weren't pushing them joints until 1989-1990.  I didn't even know Saab's made them joints that early.  And some of the clothes definitely didn't look early 80's to me except for the kicks.  However, the music was bangin and to see Doug E. Fresh perform along with hearing Kid Capri, and of course at the very beginning, hearing the GOD of rap, Rakim rap ""Paid In Full"", well what else is there to say.  LL may be the G.O.A.T. in record sales amongst his peers from that day, but we all know Rakim is the G.O.A.T. when it comes to being a lyricist.",1050624000,4,1413,4.326996197718631
1835177,4,B00008DDUY,"Ace (Wood Harris) is a young man working in a dry cleaners in 1985 Harlem. His friend Mitch (Mekhi Phifer) sells cocaine, drives flashy cars, and has cash to burn. When Mitch goes to prison and a couple of coincidences leave Ace with a ball of cocaine in his pocket and customers waiting to buy, Ace decides to enter the drug-dealing business that he had previously shunned. He quickly rises to prominence as the cocaine kingpin of Harlem. When Mitch is released from prison, Ace brings him into the business as a partner, along with Mitch's volatile acquaintance from prison, Rico (Cam'ron). When violence erupts, Ace begins to question whether the money that his cocaine business has provided him is worth its cost.

At first look, Paid In Full seems to retread a lot of territory that has already been covered in a slew of films about inner-city drug-dealing since the 1980's. There are a couple of things that set this film apart, however, and make it worth seeing. This film emphasizes the characters' development and inner struggles more, and the trappings of the gangsta lifestyle less, than most films on the same topic. And Paid In Full is based on a true story: the story of AZ, Rich Porter, and Alpo, three young men who controlled the cocaine trade in Harlem in the mid-1980's. (Called Ace, Mitch, and Rico, respectively, in the film.) Azie Faison, who was AZ back then, cooperated with the film and wrote an early version of the screenplay. He has since criticized the film for glamorizing the gangsta lifestyle too much and not being a strong enough cautionary tale. I don't find that Paid In Full glamorizes the lifestyle all that much, but its criticism of gangsta life is not heavy-handed either. Perhaps it is better that the film did not moralize as much as it could have because that tends to alienate the audience. You will have to see it and judge for yourself.

The film's faults are more annoying than serious. I found it slow in parts. And there is a lot of carelessness with accuracy. The film states at the outset that it takes place in 1985-1986. But the Saab sports cars that the drug dealers are so fond of driving are not 1980's models. And someone talks on a cell phone in one scene -a little, modern cell phone, not a huge 1980's model. First-time feature film director Charles Stone should try hard to avoid this sort of sloppiness in the future, as it can ruin a perfectly good movie.

I recommend Paid In Full for its realistic depiction of a particular lifestyle -and its consequences- in a particular time and place in American History. It is especially interesting because the events are seen through the eyes of someone who actually lived them.",1050192000,9,2684,4.682203389830509

1835681,3,B00008DDUY,"""Paid in Full"" is the story of three Harlem drug dealers - AZ, Rich Porter and maniac serial killer Alpo.  It is loosely based on their exploits, mainly concentrating on AZ's story.  Some things are embellished, others simplified for film purposes, but it more or less captures the essence of events surrounding their criminal ways.  Not even emphasis on their killing people or having to pay off cops to stay in business!

As far as the BD quality goes, this is up their with the worst of them.  There is no HD pop or quality to it, it still looks like it did when watching it on cable back in the day.  Now is this was an artistic thing by the cinematographer or director to make it look older, then fine, but if not, this is horrible.  The colors are over saturated, there is noise, but softened and not much is sharp or detailed.  It has a picture quality like ""Juice"" on DVD, but not as sharp.  The sound is decent but do not expect a masterpiece!

Camron was pretty good as Alpo - a sick serial killer.  This guy admitted to killing 14 people - many his closest associates  and he would speak with joy about the killing.  I swear, this guy may have used the cocaine biz as an excuse to kill as many as he could.  He spoke less about his money and more about the killing!  He is locked up, but since he snitched, this psycho killer will be up for parole in 2018 for 35 year sentence!  Even if he does not make parole, he will still be out of prison!  That is sick.

This disc could have had extras on the real life situation, a making of or something to go along with the story, but there was nothing.  They need to remaster and re encode this one.",1405987200,,1653,4.207006369426751

The video 'Soul Survivor"" by Young Jeezy was based on this film, so if you've seen that then you have some idea of what the movie is about.  It's a drug related story about a simple guy, an under-dog, who becomes ""the man"" on the streets, a character that you would've never thought had it in him.  Cam'ron gives a wonderful performance in this film and brings his character, Rico, to life.  This movie, however, is somewhat of a tragedy.  I love this movie and I've watched it over fifty times.  I recommend this movie to everyone who's seen Scarface.

1835929,4,B00008DDUY,"Paid in full isn't your typical ""ganasta"" movie. This one has some depth to it. It's starts off on the stage. The stage is a strip of Harlem that all the big time cats show off there wealth to the ladies and their competion. The movie is really good. Ace is a hard worker at the local cleaners. His friend ""Money Making Mitch"" is the local big time hustler. Mitch's sister is Ace's girlfriend. Ace knows of the game but doesn't want to involve himself in it. Mitch always clowns him by calling him the ""George Jefferson of the projects"". Ace then picks up a guys cleaning from his apartment and notices that the gentlemen has left him a present in his pocket. When Ace sells it, it clicks in head. Why spend time sweating in a sweatbox making pennies when I can make serious dollars. So he starts in the game. But his friend Mitch gets busted for taking care of someone who messed with one of his employees. While on the inside, Mitch hears that Ace is blowing up. Making big money. Then Rico (Cam'ron) befriends Mitch when someone made a phone check on him. They both get out and hook up with Ace to make serious money. They are the kings of harlem. Mitch is flashy but chilled with it. Ace is on the downlow. Rico is the wild one. Its one scene when he is taking pictures with a robe on with a piece in the air and when he shows his homeboys how he gets down on videotape. I fell on the ground laughing. But in the end, Rico was a snake and kills Mitch but Ace sets him up to get busted by the FEDS. Overall a pretty good movie. I had a flashback.

1835930,5,B00008DDUY,"for a black gangsta movie Paid in Full is really the best you can have. It is no Hollywood level/and flair in those kind of movies but that is what make them so special and this movie knows how to use that. It got Mekhi Phfifer staring and also Camron who gives a good performance. Mekhi Phfifer for is part is very credible in the role as local drug-dealer Mitch.

this movie is about a regular guy who is flashed by the drug-dealers lifestyle and takes the chance to join when it is offered.

what i like most about this movie is the realism,no movie where 50 people getting shot by one guy and so...but a movie that really tries to show every aspect from the life of a drug-dealer in a passionated way.

the movie is not boring at any minute and every leading actor plays a very good role. The last 15 minutes  of the movie make it an end you wouldn t have expected,at least not like this.

so 5 stars but if you would take gangster movie like the Godfather Trilogie,Casino or Goodfellas in the rating it would turn down to 4 stars.",1125187200,,1035,4.233502538071066

1835932,5,B00008DDUY,"I can understand many of the bad reviews that I have read surrounding this film. Many have refered to this movie as a typical hood film and it is; but, at a level that captures the realm of economic prosperity (due to the crack-cocaine epidemic) that saturated ghettos everywhere. Unlike New Jack City, it was more realistic. It opened the project doors and windows for America to see.

It was based upon a true story, and presented cameo of each of the 3 actual hustlers (drug-dealers)that conquered Harlem in the mid 80's. Excellent film.

In order to really be able to appreicate the film at a height, I think that it is beneficial to have some knowledge of that time period ... and maybe even some knowledge of the hood.",1115856000,27,724,4.561538461538461
1835933,4,B00008DDUY,"The one thing I appriciate about this movie, is it's feel to realisim, and the feel of old harlem hood movies.  It's not another State Property, Baby Boy or some horsecrap gangsta movie.

This movie is about Ace(Wood Harris) and his best friend Mitch(Mekhi Phifer) who get good buisness going out, but Mitch is put behind bars when he tries to get a nusience off his block.  So Ace makes his move, and makes everyone happy becoming the top dog around.

But in the world of Harlem drug dealers, there's always a load of backstabbing snakes filled with envy.  They try to get their way by kidnapping, jacking, and murder.  And this movie tells that in a very balievable way.

This movie is highly underratted, and should be seen by everyone in the intrest of hood, or gang movies. Even Cam'ron's preformance is nice too.  This movie delievers with actors who can act, and not crap like State Property run by rappers.

1835934,5,B00008DDUY,"Wood Harris, Mekhi Phifer and Cam`Ron brought eighties back to life for me in this film.  This film is almost like watching a documentary.  I was sixteen in 86 and living in Harlem.  I remember cell phones the size of bricks and beepers with no read outs.  This was the age when only doctors and drug dealers carried beepers.  I remember when ""The Rooftop"" was Harlem's hottest club.  And if you had the dough Dapper Dan could make you a Gucci or Lois Vuiton jacket or suit.  When Timbs were strictly an ""uptown"" thing.  You could go to the club or ""The Pro Rucker"" (a famous harlem B-ball court where summer league games were held), and see these cats upclose and in person.  Ghetto superstars Alpo (Rico), Richie Rich (Mitch) and yes the likable character AZ (Ace).  Now remember im only sixteen broke and working at Mickey D's.  So I don't know the story behind the glam.  Just what I see and ofcourse the ghetto gossip.  I say gossip because in the hood by the time the story reaches you, ""he had a 38"" some how manifests itself into ""he had two chrome UZI's"".  I also remember the late model  European  whips.  The truck jewelry and the wads of cash these dudes carried around as pocket change.  I went to school with Alpo's lil sista.  She had a gucci bag for every day of the week and wore a mink coat in the winter.  It was crazy.  In the Seventies Harlem belonged to Nicky Barnes.  The eighties belonged to Alpo (Rico), Richie Rich (Mitch) and  AZ (Ace).  In closing, this movie isn't quite ""Scarface"".  But a great gangster flick none the less, based on a true story as told by AZ.",1110240000,33,1591,4.384879725085911

1835966,5,B00008DDUY,"Paid in Full is one of the greatest hood movies ever made, although this film goes far beyond just being a hood movie. The realness of the characters and situations enables the viewer to feel the characters emotions. Their happiness, hopes, and fears. The actors and directors really meshed together and this is evident in the quality of the film. Most of the film was actually shot in Harlem where all these events took place so the movie has a certain roughness to it that really helps the viewer to understand the environment and the atmosphere of the time.
  This is definately a five star film. The drug dealing, violence, and  sex are great aspects of this film because these aspects give the film edge. Overall this is a good story and the actors in this film really did a good job of allowing the viewer to develop a relationship with them and their feelings.

It's the new school New Jack City and Belly all in one. This is a very real portrait of life in the big cities. It takes place in the late 80's and they have everything down to a science, even how we used to wear our pants cuffed at the bottom and those big glasses we thought was the bomb. This movie makes you reminisce. With special apperances by Doug E Fresh you forget it 2004. If your into movies like Belly and New Jack City this is a must see!",1097971200,,592,4.02542372881356
1836003,5,B00008DDUY,"Paid in Full was a true story based around 3 drug dealers that are faced on the daily basis with the consequences of this lifestyle.  They have plenty of respect from the people around them, but some just couldn't respect them because of their expertise in the field.  After awhile, everything goes south and jealousy messes up everything. One ends up dead, one ends locked up, and one ends up just fine being rich in the longrun. Drugs and the love for the money were what brought these 3 together and it is what tears them apart.

  When I first heard of Paid in Full I wasn't really interested.  Then, when I sat down and actually gave the movie the time of day I was amazed. This movie had some things in it that wouldn't strike the average viewer because of the things that they have todo to survive, but it was excelent.  This was a true story and what made it so good was that it gave such a good insight as to what life was like for these 3 men.  Then after seeing the documentary I was able to appreciate the movie so much more bacause it was so accurate.",1097452800,3,1064,4.232673267326732
1836004,5,B00008DDUY,"I was cautious about renting this movie at first.  I thought it would be another sad attept to make a modern day film about the life or druglords.  Plus, I've never been a fan of rapper Cam'Ron, so when I saw he was in the film I was even more cautious.

But after watching this film, I am amazed.  The emotion was there, the humor too, and the realism was unquestionable.  Cam'Ron is actually a pretty good actor, and is very surprising in his role as Rico, who's similar to a modern day O-Dog(Menace II Society).  Overall though, I found Mekhi Phieffer(Mitch) to be my favorite in this.  I could really connect with his emotion, like I can with a lot of his films.  Wood Harris was great to as Ace, a kid working at a dry cleaners place until he is corrupted by the drug world.  The scene where Ace sees ""Scarface"" for the first time was really impressive.  I liked the way that while Tony Montana was defending his empire in the movie, Mitch and his gang are retaliating against another gang.

Overall, this isn't a life changing film, but it is definitely up there with ""Boyz N The Hood"" and ""Menace II Society"".

Did you'll peep that it was Scarface that they were watching?

You got your Mans Ace tryin' to be righteous.  Work a gig, help mama, be legal.  It didn't stop the gleam that he had from watching as his Mans was rolling in nice cars, and new gear.

It's by pure LUCK/MISFOTUNE that Ace, gets a connection into the cocaine world.  He goes from no chance in hell to being the Man whose feeding the block.

This is a true story, that doesn't plug the game.  This movie shows you how these 3 young boys seized HARLEM, and like always money/power tore up the foundation.

from rags...to riches...to ruin...

Figured Cam' to be a shady guy off top!  I mean isn't it always one in the mix.  Mekhi really blew me away with his performance as a loving big brother, and friend.

1836006,4,B00008DDUY,"My fascination with gangsters on film continues. In Paid In Full, the most telling scene is the Harlem young people in a movie theatre watching Al Pacino's, Scarface.  They love that movie, cheer the crazy, bloodthirsty, self-made, only-in-America bad guy. When poor and black Harlem residents get a handle on the new drugs in the early eighties like cocaine and crack, money rains down. Wood Harris goes from delivery boy to kingpin of the Harlem drug trade.  His buddies are more flamboyant than he.  That youthful enthusiasm for easy money in the face of ""The Man,"" proves to be our hero's downfall.

1836008,4,B00008DDUY,"When I first check the summary on the back cover of this DVD casing, I'd figured, ""Aw, man.  Not another movie about drug dealers at the projects"", but after watching PAID IN FULL, there was more to this movie than from my previous expectation.  This movie was based on a true story, and it was depicit on that true nature pretty well.  It was about a typical brotha' narratin' his life as a low-down homeboy named Ace working at a low-down dry-cleaner shop in the mid-80s, and later he decides to walk down the road of ""drug-dealership""; coincidentely, he follows the road the way Al Pacino does in SCARFACE.  He starts his ""business"" cheap for the ""consumers"", hire peeps to control marketing order in the streets, so ""everybody can eat"" and Ace can bring love and respect for the people on the streets and his family and friends, while at the same, keeping his business discreet from 'the man'.  Sadly, as good as how he keep everything organized for the good of his fellowship, he hasn't a clue to the hardship and sacrifices he's going to face as he walks down this easy road.
As recyclable and semi-predictable this movie can be, PAID IN FULL is deep, and it does wonders on showing the experience on a drug dealer's life.  For a company that makes Jay-Z LPs, Roc-a-fella did a good job making this movie, and for brining a good selection of cast, not to mentions collaboratin' few of the rappers like Cam-ron and Doug E. Fresh.  Wood Harris did good with his narration and portrayin' Ace, but I got to give it up to Mekhi Phifer.  He show a lot of passion with his role showing how much he supports his friends and his younger brother hoping his bro' would be a better person in the future, and for that, I'd say his acting was very good.  It's not wonderful, but he did a pretty strong performance.  The music score is good as well, but strangely, in one certain scene, the movie's playing a Phil Collins's song in the background.  Why did they even put that song in a movie like this, I'm not so sure.
I would've wanted more from this movie after watching it, but the extras in this DVD are lacking, since it only has a commentary and trailers for other films.  To 'da point, PAID IN FULL isn't gonna put a gunshot through my chest and into my heart(in a positive remark), it isn't provoking enough to see this different than any other films of the same theme, but with its above-par actors and true-to-life nature of 80s uptown, this movie has paid in full and served me well to enjoy it.",1074902400,,2498,4.442013129102845
