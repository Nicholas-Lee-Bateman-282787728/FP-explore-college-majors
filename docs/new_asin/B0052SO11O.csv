4530918,3,B0052SO11O,"Loved the band performances and the feel of the movie.  The date rape portion was disturbing and the relationship between the father and daughter was corny.  The ending was contrived, but I have been meaning to see this movie for a long time based on the historically accurate portion of the movie that deal with the confrontations between the police department and the pre-hippie kids hanging on the Sunset Strip.",1461715200,,414,4.9
4530919,2,B0052SO11O,"This movie was kind of hokie and the acting was poor. I didn't get any real feeling for the time and place depicted. In the late 60s, when I was a teenager, I'd hitchhike over Laurel Canyon Blvd. to the Sunset Strip. It wasn't at all like how this film portrayed it, but this film was an earlier time period.  There was one band in the film where the singer sounded somewhat like Mic Jagger. The movie was amusing at best.",1412208000,2,422,4.209876543209877
4530920,5,B0052SO11O,"What a funny/ridiculous film!  It was probably created by some washed-up middle-aged screenwriter who took an illegal drug (or two) back in `67 (after the actual Sunset strip Riots took place) and banged-away on his ol' typewriter until he finally passed out.  An American International director somehow found this masterpiece and created this wildly inaccurate exploitation movie.

It kicks-off with stock footage of the Sunset Strip and long haired Vietnam Era kids in their teens and twenties enjoying themselves by wandering up and down the boulevard--much to the chagrin of the oily-haired World War II generation.  The on-duty deputies kept repeating to the kids, ""Move along, move along.""

Suddenly we're transported into Pandora's Box, a teenaged nightclub long since demolished, featuring a mediocre band making rude noises.

Next stop: ""An ordinary high school, with ordinary kids just like yours or mine"", except these are twenty-something actors and actresses posing as teenagers in expensive hip clothes. And one of them is Mickey Rooney's kid, the late Tim Rooney.  Poor Tim, even with his SAG Card, he never had much of an acting career.

Back in the Box and our faux teeners have left the schoolgrounds and are now enjoying listening to yet another talentless local band wanging-out some song about a gal named Jolene that did them wrong...or something.  The short-haired club owner catches the teeners with a bottle of ""sneaky pete"" and gives them a mild lecture.  Meanwhile, at the same time, the cops catch a group of untamed youth smoking wacky tobaccky.

The plot thickens.  A local teevee newsman representing the local business owners (huh?) informs the cops that the businessmen want to form an association to exclude ""longhairs"" from ruining their neighborhood by taking ""acids"".

Again, we're back in the Box and them longhairs are still listening and dancing to substandard rock `n' roll...and on and on it goes.

Eventually poor-girl Andi (Mimsey Farmer, who like Tim Rooney, who never had much of an acting career) and her friends break into a ritzy house.  She takes LSD-25, does a slow motion interpretative dance, with colored lights shining on her.  And for her troubles she gets a PG-13 gang-rape by three spoiled rich kids and then she's taken off to the hospital.  In the waiting-room  her law enforcement father overhears the perpetrators bragging about their latest conquest, while inquiring, ""Who's the rat fink that put the finger on us?""  The Cop/Dad/WW2 Vet gets angry and beats-up all three while the duty nurse does a wonderful job of overacting.  And this overreach of police powers, of course, caused the riot on the Sunset Strip.  (What a lie!)  But, according to the Los Angeles Chronicle's glaring headlines: Strip Seethes In Wake Of Police ""Youth Beating""  And now we finally know why the kids went crazy out in West Hollywood so long ago(but do we care?).

I was lucky enough to see this movie for 35 cents back in 1967, in an actual motion picture theater.  For almost an hour and a half the entire building was convulsed with laugher, in all the wrong places of course.  I definitely got my monies worth watching this exploitation misfire, which I highly recommend!",1384560000,10,3218,5.0359168241965975
4530921,4,B0052SO11O,"I had no idea this would ever get released on DVD; I will definitely be ordering one. I taped this off cable (TCM?) in 2000. I'd read about the movie but never saw it until then. When I bought a VHS to DVD converter, that tape of ""Riot"" was the first thing I tried it on. I still watch the resulting DVD-R occasionally, mostly to hear the music. I'm familiar with the Standells and the other groups in the movie, but I've always wondered what the music is that's playing while Andy starts tripping at the house. ""Put some records on the hi-fi,"" Tim Rooney's character says. I don't think it's the Standells or Watchband, and I know next to nothing about Enemys. I've asked on message boards and everywhere else I could think of but no one seems to know.",1383782400,3,753,4.347517730496454
4530922,4,B0052SO11O,"Peculiar but entertaining exploitation movie.  It's a combination of mental hygiene film, dull police drama, and juvenile delinquent sickie.  Troubled Mimsy Farmer gets involved with the wrong crowd and winds up confronting her estranged cop father, Aldo Ray.  What makes this film worth watching is the music - garage rock monsters The Standells, The Enemies, and the great Chocolate Watchband all perform at cool L.A. club Pandora's Box.  Also, Mimsy Farmer's LSD freak out is awesome.  When I saw this movie on TV as a teenager, I thought it was the best movie ever.",1326153600,13,569,5.01063829787234
4530923,5,B0052SO11O,The acid trip scene is worth the price of admission alone; a perfect teen/parent clash of what life was like in the late 60's.  A must-own for people age 50 & over,1318982400,9,163,4.09375
4530924,4,B0052SO11O,"[RIOT ON SUNSET STRIP - (1967) - Widescreen Presentation - Directed by Arthur Dreifuss] Props to MGM for finally releasing this campy cult classic on dvd. The film opens in a Sunset Strip (where else?) niteclub with The Standells playing the garage-band anthem title song (ignore the MGM and Amazon product details error regarding this predating their Top Ten hit 'Dirty Water', which hit the charts in July '66 and this flick wasn't released till '67) while the opening credits roll, setting the stage for the entire movie that follows. No joke - listen to the lyrics, and there's the entire movie in a capsule for easy digesting. The acid cubes come later...

The story involves the clash between the newly-empowered hippie youth that took control over the Strip, the assorted business owners who wanted nothing more than to see them destroyed, and the tightly-wound police who tended to get cracking with their billy-clubs a bit hastily. Soon the entire Strip becomes a powder-keg fueled by drugs, alcohol, underage offenders, bastardly business owners and underpaid and over-anxious cops. A nice crescendo is built up gradually by director Arthur Dreifuss, and the performances are efficient and true to the times which were a'changing.

The cast is led by Mimsy Farmer (who played similar roles in the mid-60's before heading off to Europe to star in several effective giallo films) as a straight-laced 17 year-old chick who gets involved with a 'bad crowd' (led by Mickey Rooney's son, Tim) who cavort around in hopped-up sports cars, drinking and drugging and breaking into homes to throw acid parties - good times indeed. Under this influence of rowdy rebels, ridiculous clothing, revolt and rebellion, we watch as she spirals down into the den of decay that culminates with a spiked LSD drink followed by liberated and libidinous dancing, then being sexually violated by five, count 'em, five denizens of this depravity. Part exploitation film, part cautionary tale and all psyched-out to the glorious max, the film ends remarkably upbeat when daughter and police lieutenant father (played by Aldo Ray) are re-united for the finale. Trust me, it plays out much better than it sounds, but you probably have to be over 40 to enjoy to its fullest. Screw youth.

The soundtrack is a psych sunspot, with the Chocolate Watchband and (now-forgotten) The Enemies appearing in addition to The Standells two opening tracks, the club scenes are hilariously campy while not being too far from the truth, the dialogue rich with 60's buzzwords, and the babes are go-go-ing, shimmy-ing and shaking in the hippest threads - it's a gas, man, a real gas. A true cult film in every sense. It ought to come with a headband and love beads. I had a blast watching it, and if you're still reading this nonsense, odds are you will too. It's a riot.",1317340800,25,2833,4.947478991596639

8454375,2,B0052SO11O,"Riot on Sunset Strip is a movie filmed around a soundtrack, which is not as effective or enjoyable as an actual movie.  Too many scenes are dominated by lengthy musical performances (either live or playing in the background), cutting dialogue to a minimum and undermining whatever drama the script was trying to create (see nearly every scene in Pandora's Box and Farmer's slow-mo, acid-trip dance).  The films plays out as would a more sensitive episode of Dragnet, a sentimental square's view of protest-era pubescence that never really gets around to examining much of anything.  The father-daughter drama at the heart of the film is given far too little time, and the conclusion is clipped and without much substance.",1488412800,,721,5.093220338983051

8454381,4,B0052SO11O,"The runtime is just 86 minutes, but this topical 1967 programmer masterminded by producer Sam Katzman has over 30 minutes of source music and original scoring, coordinated by Fred Karger. Because of the marketability of the Standells, Chocolate Watchband and the Enemies, there was a highly collectable soundtrack vinyl originally released by the Capitol subsidiary Tower Records, and the band tracks--some 22 minutes--are suddenly very hip once again, especially in Watchband frontman David Aguilar's maracas-wielding Jagger impersonation. This is cool stuff, and the music needs the film's visuals--both a cut above AIP's usual indie standards--for full retro impact.

In a lumpen way RIOT is a Metro musical, commissioned by that studio but successfully rushed into theatrical bookings by AIP. (Katzman, Mimsy Farmer and Laurie Mock simultaneously filmed HOT RODS FROM HELL, which did undeservedly receive drive-in promotion by MGM.) RIOT's great setpiece--and the real reason for owning this widescreen remaster--is Mimsy Farmer's extraordinary acid-freakout dance solo, choreographed by Hal Belfer and showily photographed by Metro's Paul Vogel. Farmer writhes and gyrates, dancing with her big hair, for over seven minutes (there are only five cutaways) to a blues jam based on Paul Butterfield's ""East-West"" that morphs seamlessly into Fred Karger's original full-orchestra scoring. This is a stunning (and riotous) keeper sequence in great musical films, and the music track does not appear on RIOT's soundtrack releases.

Mimsy and Laurie are terrifically groovy as miniskirted hippiechicks, and there are surprisingly perceptive, nonjudgmental turns by Michael Evans and Anna Mizrahi Strasberg as liberal, understanding grownups. The great Aldo Ray--before stardom an elected constable in Crockett, California--plays Farmer's estranged parent, a beleaguered LAPD division chief stressfully charged with conciliating between Sunset Blvd. freaks and straights, and beefy Aldo has a great cartoonish revenge punchout with the daughter's abusers.

Besides its Metro-musical leanings, RIOT also mimics Warners' Nick Ray masterpiece REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. Aldo plays a variation on Jim Backus (without the apron), Mimsy a variation on Jimmy Dean (without the teeshirt but with bigger hair). The misunderstood teens ""appropriate"" a house on fictional Diego Drive, for Mimsy's dance spectacular, and the groovy party would be even more complete if Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood popped in with candlesticks and incense. In the end, after Farmer's humiliation and degradation, father and daughter reconcile, and Aldo Ray superintends a balanced and peaceful coexistence between the Strip's uptight straights and the dance-crazed freaks.

The film simplifies its issues and stereotypes its players, but the music unites and heals, and unlike most AIP topical quickies this one has permanent popcult value because of that generation-spanning music, which makes the film larger than the sum of its parts. Farmer's dancearama is alone worth the ticket price, ensuring her cult status in Europe with a followup film for Dario Argento and her subsequent reinvention as a sculptor.",1470787200,,3171,5.754797441364605
8454382,4,B0052SO11O,I allways find the 1960s interesting especially when Hollywood tries to do anything about the drug culture. Although this movie can be a bit drag net like its a fun time capsule.,1469923200,,178,4.59375
8454383,2,B0052SO11O,"For a movie that was advertised as tantalizing, this one is dated like so many teen flicks (a great exception is Village of the Giants). that AIP did. They attempted to be so ""spot on"" for the times that they were dated the year they came out, and this  like the Beach movies seemed barely watchable. I'll try again, some night when I have a more tolerant mood for it. Certainly has more star wattage than you'd expect for Roger Corman, and it seems less dark than so much of his stuff.",1464566400,,486,4.282608695652174
