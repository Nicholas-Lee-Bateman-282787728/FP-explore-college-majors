4383980,5,B004I654W6,"First, be aware that if you are a sicko into torture-porn, this movie is not for you.  It's a fun horror flick for people who normally don't like horror movies.  It's a fun roller-coaster film of laughs and screams.  While not a parody in the genre of ""Scary Movie"", you will find yourself laughing at the intentionally funny dialog when you are not on the edge of your seat wondering who will get taken out next.  And the main characters are rather unsympathetic, so you are left not sure who to root for as the film progresses.  Is the villain really a villain or did the victims have it coming?  So if you don't take it too seriously, you can sit back and enjoy the ride.

Though the movie is not rated, it would most likely get an R for language, implied (off camera) sexual situations (though no nudity unfortunately), drug use, and brief graphic violence.",1309564800,2,861,4.480769230769231
4383981,5,B004I654W6,"I bought this movie to support my long time friend Ashley Watkins who plays Jenny. But I was surprized to find out that the movie was actually pretty funny! It sorta has a ""Scream"" feel to it, comedy and horror.",1306022400,2,211,4.3
4383982,5,B004I654W6,"I don't usually watch scary, gory movies but a friend of mine wanted to watch this one.  I was very pleased because it wasn't grossly gory, and was surprisingly funny in parts.  Definitely worth watching!",1300492800,2,204,4.8
4383983,5,B004I654W6,"I was expecting a blood and guts horror movie but I was surprised at the amount of humor in it. I loved being able to laugh at someone even though I knew they were about to die. Reminded me of some of the horror movies I saw when i was younger, but I wouldn't let a kid watch this as the humor is ""adult"" humor and there is more than enough blood and gore to give a kid nightmares. Definitely worth watching again to see what I missed the first time around.",1300147200,2,457,3.9782608695652173
8430153,2,B004I654W6,"My rating is taking into consideration all movies ever made (probably unlike all the overrated reviews, which make one wonder if those came from friends and family of the actors and producers of the film).  As just one entry in the plethora of low-budget horror movies, it's mildly effective and at least has some style (a heavy metal soundtrack instead of scary sound effects), if not much imagination, with the poop, fart, and sex jokes being a bit much, and unfortunately there's a decided lean towards gore and away from genuine scares.  It's scary to think that movies like this may be the future of the horror genre (no pun intended).  Only recommended if your WiFi/Internet and cable are down, if your car is in the shop, or if you have a couple of beers in you ;)",1479340800,,771,4.572463768115942
8430154,4,B004I654W6,"Released in 2010 and written/directed by Richard Swindell, Pelt chronicles the misadventures of six obnoxious youths in Kentucky when they embark on a backpacking hike deep in the unknown woods and evidently tick off some inbred whack job.

Considering that Pelt is a micro-budget movie compared to 2003 Wrong Turn, I was impressed with how well-made it is. Sure, the youths are mostly annoying at first, but their arses are all humbled in good time, BIG TIME. Moreover, the three girls are appealing in a girl-next-door type of way (despite their initial obnoxiousness), particularly Ashley Watkins as Jenny and Amber Marie Bollinger as Jessica. Unlike Wrong Turn, the movie tries to mix-in comedy and parody, like 2007s Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, with uneven results. Nevertheless, while nothing great, Pelt is worth catching if you like backwoods slasher flicks. I actually like it better than Wrong Turn and its close to being on par with Wrong Turn 2.

The movie runs 87 minutes and was shot in Northern California, which is a bad stand-in for Kentucky because anyone whos been to Kentucky knows it doesnt look like Northern California.

8430155,5,B004I654W6,"The film started lackluster but ended up pretty good. I like the bond these young hikers developed by the time they were trying to survive. A unexpected ending with heart wrenching scenes, this is an above average slasher movie.",1461283200,,228,4.871794871794871
8430156,4,B004I654W6,"The story is a fun, modern nightmare that puts fuel into the ""camping/in the woods"" horror film. I really didn't expect a lot from ""Pelt"" but was pleasantly surprised. Swindell creates a very suspenseful chiller that plays with elements of slasher, grindhouse and splatter horror. The cast commit to their characters and pull off some pretty authentic personalities that I connected with. ""Pelt"" does find itself battling through some pretty standard clichs, but never gets marred down completely by the stereotypes. Even with a few of the characters coming off a bit abrasive, (douche-bag daddy-o's) , the actors give convincing performances that does take the characters into caricature territory.

The special effects are strong, realistic grue that explores elements of exploitation, and splatter without pushing the kill scenes into sensationalized depravity. There is a nice balance between the horror elements and the psychological suspense that makes ""Pelt"" a very strong horror film. The soundtrack and sound effects create a tense, thrilling atmosphere that carries the story arch from the first scene until the credits roll. Honestly I went into this film expecting to be disappointed or bored, but instead I was captivated and chilled. ""Pelt"" is a film that I will be watching over and over.

There is some downer moments to ""Pelt"". The dialog is weak in some scenes, with characters feeling forced into conversation with one another, instead of seeming natural. It does ad a bit of a hokey vibe that disrupts the intensity and drama of the story. Honestly that is really the only hiccups I had while watching ""Pelt"". The kills are bloody, there is screaming and crying, running through the woods. Brutality is the theme de jour for ""Pelt"" with some truly nightmarish moments. I will be referencing this film the next time I decide to explore the hills and back roads in my neck of the woods-believe that!",1431907200,,1917,5.101910828025478

8430160,3,B004I654W6,"The film opens with three rude, crude tank top cuties calling a bikers names. Some young men join them as they hurry off to a private trail to hike on for some reason or another. Then the title of the film plays a spoiler as they meet a non-introduced character who collects human pelts.

I liked the girls who I thought were going to lose their tops at any moment. The language was crude and rude but fitting for the film and was perhaps the high spot. The killings were not graphic. It looks like someone broke a realistic looking blow up doll and decided to call it a pelt, make a movie about it so they could get another one.

The pajamas was a nice touch.

Parental guide: F-bomb. Brief sex. Fake corpse nudity.",1404777600,,716,4.288888888888889
8430161,5,B004I654W6,"at first i had a hard time getting interested in this film but after a few minutes this movie became a whole lot better. the storyline and filming were fantastic and the mood and feel of the movie was super. so a quick breakdown of the film... there are 3 really hot and sexy chicks and 3 horny hunks that are intent on bedding them. they go hiking deep in the mountains and set of camp complete with tents and sleeping bags. the girls were quite enticing and did a great job with their lines and acting. the couples fool around several times and spy on one another, drinking beer and smoking joints. a really hot chick who claims to be a nymphomanic teases and has sex with most of the guys. more sexiness and perhaps nudity would have really spiced up this film. a sex scene of one of the chicks running around half dressed was provocative but she meets a quick demise after accidentally jumping in front of a truck, what a shame. the killer captures the chicks and takes them back to his cabin where he locks them in small cages. i am curious thou, as to what abuse/torture scenes hit the cutting room floor, but one can only hope that there will be a later version complete with previously deleted scenes full restored.
overall a great movie for guys and gals.",1371427200,,1264,4.382978723404255
8430162,2,B004I654W6,"Pelt isn't much better than most horror flicks that go straight to video. It's plagued with overused slasher film ideas, and a healthy dose of bad acting.

There are only three redeeming features about this movie. One is that the wilderness shots (Northern California in place of Kentucky) are nice. The other is that the budget seemed a bit better than most horror flicks that go straight to DVD. And finally, it features the extremely sexy Amber Bollinger.

Aside from that, there isn't much to this film. The characters are meant to be hip 20's kids, despite the cast all noticeably being in their 30's. The dialogue is weak, and there are a number of sub-plots that are never addressed as the film moves forward. Much of the plot is noticeably lifted from the ""Wrong Turn"" movie franchise.

There's a decent amount of gore, though some of it is off-camera. There's a good bit of eye candy, but there's oddly no nudity. The only things that really helped the film stand out was the soundtrack, and at least one truly suspenseful moment involving a confrontation with the villain.

The only reason I'm rating this two stars instead of one is because Amber Bollinger running around the woods in her undies is one of the few reasons this movie was even worth watching. Give this one a watch only if you have time to kill, otherwise I'd recommend against buying the DVD.",1310774400,5,1369,4.668049792531121
