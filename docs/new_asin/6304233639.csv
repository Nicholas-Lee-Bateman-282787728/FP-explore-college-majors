810624,4,6304233639,"I SAW THIS THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT ON THEATRES.  I BAUGHT IT THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT ON VIDEO!  NOT REALISTIC, BUT VERY ENTERTAINING.  WHY WRITE A REVIEW NOW? BECAUSE IT'S COMING ON TELEVISION TONIGHT.  I REALLY ENJOYED  THIS PRODUCTION, WHICH I THINK, AND MY FRIENDS THOUGHT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO  RESULT IN A HIGH 4 OUT OF 5.",915926400,,328,4.209677419354839
810625,5,6304233639,"Anyonw who saw Men In Black and liked it is sure to love ID4. Although some parts of the script are impossible most veiwers overlook that (David could never have sent them a virus through computer unless the aliens had  Microsoft Windows) just because they want to see a funny, action-packed  movie with great actors and charectors(Bill Pullman, Will Smith). I  recomend this film to anyone who likes science fiction or comedy.",912902400,,427,4.902777777777778
810626,2,6304233639,"One can only guess at what the producers of this were after: comedy? Not that funny. Drama? Not particularly interesting.  Homage or spoof of 50s sci-fi? Maybe - although the contrived script and plot loopholes read as if  they were trying to imitate rather than parody cheesey 50s flying saucer  movies.  The first part of the film holds up well with lots of suspense and  tension, but after the aliens start to pound earth the whole thing just  comes apart.  Entertaining only if you're willing to put your brain on hold.",912816000,3,523,4.681318681318682

810870,4,6304233639,"What I liked most was Bill Pullman, the special effects, the storyline of all remaining humans putting their differences aside to work to survive the attack of an enemy from outer space. What I did not like, and did not see as necessary, was the continual cursing and lack of respect for God and Jesus by misusing their name. Sad to see a scene of the world trade center and the capital being blown up as many people died to keep that from happening on 9-11. So good to see many beloved stars. I enjoyed the storyline. Aliens were really horrifying. Good sci-fi movie. I am really not a fan of those but had a good time just enjoying the ride. Enjoy!!",1515888000,,651,4.344262295081967

Although a bit preachy about the environment in some scenes, the acting is good, the visuals spectacular and the mixing of a love story make this one of my favorite movies. The 4K conversion has worked well with the movie as subtle sharpening of some scenes and overall brighter colors has made a worthwhile improvement over the blu ray version. The extended version, included in this set, is an added bonus and what's not to like about Brent Spiner's mad scientist.",1509580800,,546,4.697916666666667

810993,3,6304233639,"Obviously, Independence Day is a great movie so we knew what we were renting. However, we rented it to this to watch with a Rifftrax audio background that makes it like an episode of Mystery Science Theater. The Rifftrax audio was recorded using the original theatrical version, which is what I thought I was renting. It turns out that this is the extended version and we kept having to pause either the movie or the Rifftrax to be able to get caught up.
So nothing against the movie or the quality. Everything was great there and renting it was easy but I wish Amazon would have put on the description that it was an extended edition. It would have made the purchase a 5 star.",1507248000,,677,4.424

811129,4,6304233639,The picture was spectacular but the audio was not equalized.  The voices were very low but the sound effects were very high so you had to crank up the volume to hear the speaking normally but then when the action hit it would blow you out of your seat.  When they master these older movies for 4K they need to remember to put just as much effort into the audio track as the picture otherwise it ruins the full effect so I reduce a star for audio issues but the picture was great.,1501545600,,479,4.139784946236559

811230,5,6304233639,"""As you can imagine they... they don't let us out much""; so says long- haired freaky Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner, was Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation).  These are the kind of gag lines sprinkled throughout the nonsense that is Independence Day, 1996 smash hit summer blockbuster that magnified 50's alien invasion B-Pics to superstardom with gargantuan special effects (which all seem to be drawn from those wonderful Amazing Stories we ate up as kids).  Don't get me wrong, I love this movie, as inane as it really is, elsewise I would not have rated it 5 Stars.  Let's get real here.  Movies are for suspension of disbelief, a recreation to take us away from the monotone lives most of us live, otherwise summer blockbusters would all fail because we would all be out DOING SOMETHING if we hadn't been standing in line for the great escape.  Independence Day is rife with problems and logical non-sequiturs that cannot be avoided on close inspection.  It is also stocked to the brim with every stereotype person you can imagine, all of them positively dripping with the character assassination of cardboard labels.  BUT, they move the picture and you along as the recycled sci-fi disasters flash and wellspring to the undeniable apocalyptic end.  There is prerequisite one-liner comedy relief, tragedy, romance, and of course every action-adventure spectacle you can imagine from aerial dog-fights to metropolitan annihilation by ray beams.  The movie did happen to launch Will Smith into superstardom along the way as well.  It also launched a 20 Year To The Day Sequel (Independence Day Resurgence, no relation to the Divergent series...) which as it turned out (I bought it and have watched it once) attempted to use the same formula in a pitifully weak gurgling of last dying breath and I am sure there will be a third ID to nail the coffin shut securely.  The original ID was pure fun and it works still, an inexpensive treat for you and the kids, break it out with popcorn and have it accessible instead of waiting for a commercial-laden showing on the Sy-Fy Channel.  Turn up the volume, turn down the lights, and watch how they blowed it up, done blowed it up real good!",1500508800,,2182,4.804812834224599

All of the other 4K disks I own look MUCH better than this one, and I would also recommend to people that unless you have a 4K that is capable of HDR playback you should NOT invest in 4K disks.

811419,5,6304233639,"The 90's was a great era for movies, there's no doubt about that. We got gems like Crimson Tide, The Rock, Dante's Peak...and the one and only Independence Day (the ""sequel"" isn't canon to me). The movie was met with some fairly positive reception back in 1996, but in modern times, it's gotten plenty of flack. While it's not a perfect movie, I think most of the negative comments are undeserved. Everyone's entitled to an opinion, including me, and in my opinion, this film's aged quite well for the most part!

I won't waste time telling you the entire plot, because chances are anyone coming here has already seen the movie. But what I can tell you is that in my honest opinion...ID4 is not a stereotypical summer popcorn movie. Is it a cerebral sci-fi flick like, say, Close Encounters or Interstellar? No...but at is core, it does raise some interesting questions. How WOULD we humans react upon seeing a fifteen-mile-wide starship floating over our cities? How would we cope if they decided to attack? How would we ultimately defeat them in the end? And also, the screenwriters really made us care about the characters. We have three that stick with us through the entire adventure: Steven Hiller (Will Smith) Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum)--all of whom feel and act like real people we'd encounter at, say, a restaurant or a grocery shop, or (in David's case) a library. None of them make it out of this invasion unaffected; though Whitmore seems to get put through the most trauma (more on that later). While he's a side-character, even Russell Casse (Randy Quaid) is well-developed enough that his epic sacrifice at the end is poignant, and who could forget that epic line, ""Hello, boys! I'm BAAAAAAAACK!!!""?!

The movie also doesn't disappoint in the dialogue and acting departments. Smith does a good job injecting humor and sarcasm at just the right areas while still managing to act like a hotshot jet pilot. Goldblum's his usual energetic-nerd self, and he does well as our voice of reason/genius. Last but not least, Pullman...that speech of his is absolutely epic! Let's face it: we all react in a positive way to it! At most, we cheer. At least, we have a big grin on our face. Either way, it stirs you emotionally. Speaking of emotions, this movie can and WILL put you on a trip with those. The only other 90's action movie that's affected me in such a way was Armageddon. Steve and David will have you snickering/laughing/smiling at their playful banter, for instance. By contrast, First Lady Whitmore's death will put a lump in your throat...

Last but not least, the action! It mostly consists of air battles and alien ships vaporizing cities, but that doesn't disappoint in the least. The air combat feels fairly realistic; you could imagine it playing out as such in real life. Also, to me, the explosions in this movie were so realistic, you could practically FEEL the heat!

Well, that's my review for a classic. Some of you may disagree with my glowing praise of the film, and that's fine. We all think differently, after all!

PS--please avoid Independence Day: Resurgence like the plague...",1491955200,,3154,4.822550831792976

This movie succeeded, because people took it for what it was... A solid summer blockbuster flick!!! A popcorn flick!!!

I give it 5 out of 5 stars, just because like I stated in my brief review, it is what it is. It is not perfect, but it is enjoyable. And for 1996 standards, it was very acceptable.",1484697600,,465,4.458823529411765

I remembered enjoying it, so I decided to watch it again recently (2016).
DO NOT DO THIS!
This simply did NOT stand the test of time at all... Everything about this, and I mean EVERYTHING is weak or worse.
I like Bill Pullman, and he's poor in this.
I like Will Smith and he's bad in this.
I like Jeff Goldblum, but in this even HE is lame.
The writing is truly terrible.

Nuclear weapons are used without success, so the heros turn to cyber warfare. They succeed and attack the aliens just as the aliens close in . My best pert in the entire film is pilot Case's final lines ""I'm Back"" just before he destroys the alien craft ( Can't say the rest of the line in the review-see the film -it is that good) So, in closing, I heartily recommend this feel good film. It really does live up to it's billing.",1477094400,3,730,4.258992805755396

I know all the words to basically the whole movie, and can quote the presidents speech word for word. This movie is one of the best ever created, and although people think it is ""cheesy"" and ""unrealistic"" I say this: put this movie side by side with any movie of late that is also described by those works and Independence Day will blow them out of the water. Movies like 2016, San Andres, and Sharknado are cheap knock off compared to this amazing movie that was one of the first of it's kine to look at an alien invasion in this way.

All the campers in the desert were a nice touch.  And the establishment of ""Plausible Deniability"" in the common lexicon was perfectly executed.

The cast is strong (despite a couple of glaringly stereotypical characters), the script is quippable, and there's just enough CG to make it interesting. Plus there's the infamous Mac OS7 in-joke.

This is kind of a let down as I do have a 7.1 sound system and was eagerly anticipating the great sound. The 5.1 audio was very good...but I was hoping for the 7.1.

815078,5,6304233639,"In 1996 America, citizens all around the country are preparing for 4th of July weekend, however before that day, several strange events take place leading up to it. On July 2nd, communications systems worldwide are sent into chaos by a strange atmospheric interference. It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species.

After attempts to communicate with the aliens go nowhere, David Levinson, an ex-scientist turned cable technician, discovers that the aliens are going to attack major points around the globe in less than a day. The last hope to stop the destruction is an unlikely group of people united by fate and unimaginable circumstances. Soon, they will all be forced to fight for the one thing that defines the 4th of July: freedom",1467590400,,921,4.941935483870968

CGI could be better at times, but 1996-cut some slack here. On my huge screen, I notice Bill Pullman has red blood spot in lower left eye towards end of film-anybody else catch this?

815176,5,6304233639,"It's been 20 years and I still love this movie. It holds up well even after 2 decades. I watch it every year around the 4th of July. I love everything about it.

The special effects are largely real world miniature models rather than CGI. So the special effects just look better than modern movies.

The story holds up. It's wildly entertaining. If you've somehow never seen this classic, you need to make it happen.

As for the DVD, the special features include 1 really interesting option. You can watch either the theatrical release or the director's cut. (On the same disc, not using 2 separate disks.) Now, like every single other director's cut ever made for any movie, the theatrical release is a better more entertaining movie. It's not even a contest. The deleted scenes form Independence Day were rightfully deleted. The editor earned his paycheck. He cut out the right stuff.

However, despite not flowing well with the film, some of the deleted scenes add details that make the story makes a little more sense. For example, you get a little more of the back story on how Miguel and his siblings came to live with Russell Casse (Randy Quaid). In the theatrical release it's clear that he's not their father. But it's not clear why he has custody of these kids. The deleted scenes clarify that.

Ultimately the director's cut is worth watching once to learn the missing story elements then can be ignored for the theatrical version your next time. Once you know those details, you'll retain that knowledge and the story will make a little more sense in the future.",1467590400,,1574,4.709090909090909

815439,4,6304233639,"An invasion may be unlikely, but if space aliens do exist, and they probably do, its a scenario Earthlings may indeed have to face one day. That day happening to be the fourth of July and the American military being as effective fighting them off as they are in this movie is patriotic hogwash, more unlikely than the invasion itself, but this War Of The Worlds is at least fun to watch.

Id prefer a more serious tone; characters drop one-liners when they should be fearing for their lives; but the jokes are funny. The plot? Entertaining. An alien mothership flies 90-billion light years not just to kill every living being on Earth but to consume its natural resources before going on to the next planet. Thats where a Marine pilot and a cable repair man come into play.

I'm all for giving it humor, but at least make it semi realistic - there were far too many close calls, especially during flight scenes. I know this movie was produced some time ago, but I couldn't get over the sheer lack of realism.",1467158400,,507,4.3936170212765955

This movie has always made me feel good about the USA and the people you meet everyday. In the face of adversity, people join together and make do. Sure, it's science fiction and in parts played for just fun, but that just demonstrates how one can find humility and even some humor in dire straits. To sum it up in a cliche, it's the American Spirit.

816438,3,6304233639,"With the sequel finally coming out, it felt like time to revisit the original. Airplane! with aliens, this is one deeply, deeply stupid movie, and a lot of (presumably) unintentional fun. Randy Quaid, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Harry Connick Jr. and several others give hands-down the worst performances in a major motion picture since, um, ever. Then again, their characters are ridiculous cartoons. The dialogue is so relentlessly dopey it seems intentional, with Quaid getting the honor of saying some of the very worst lines in movie history, though others get their share. Some of the action sequences -- especially the jet fighter scenes -- look like they were conceived and staged by five-year-olds. The absurd patriotic hoo-hah at the end is a clear sign that Roland Emmerich was having a Starship Troopers go at Americans. Yet both despite and because of all that, you kinda gotta like it, if for nothing else than as one of the biggest-budget MST3K cheesefests ever made. In the words of my generation, it sucks, but in a way that's so gigantically awful it's fun. It's also sort of historically interesting as an artifact of a pre-9/11 universe where enemies knocking down some of our biggest landmark buildings was still the stuff of summer blockbuster fantasy.",1466035200,,1273,5.009433962264151

I had to set the volume on 85 to hear the actor's conversations. When special effects took place, I had to reduce volume to 20. Initial thoughts was my TV had something wrong with it.

To ensure it wasn't my TV, I changed to Air TV and Vure volume was 20. I was able to hear conversations and special effects without these audio issues.

816814,5,6304233639,"I remember going to see this at the movies when it debuted, yes, on the fourth of July 1996.  One of the great sci-fi movies of our time, Independence Day is a roller-coaster ride of a movie. Action, Adventure, Humor, Romance, you name it this movie has got it. Anyone that thinks this movie stinks does not deserve the honor of being a movie fan. It is an excellent and powerful ride of a movie. It's even better widescreen.  his movie has it all action, romance, aliens, space ships, jet fighters, nuclear bombs and great special effects! the heck with writing - if you want writing go read a book. If you want thrills, spills and good fun then this is your movie.
Oh yes, the point that I feel this movie makes is that humans may not be the center of the universe (even though we think and act like we are) and if we keep blindly advertising our existance with radio waves etc. we just might attract a life form that is higher on the galactic food chain than we are and we had better be prepared!",1464912000,,999,4.28042328042328
816815,3,6304233639,"Only July 2, a mysterious object shows up near the moon. It broadcasts a signal that's picked up on Earth. No one can understand it--not scientists at S.E.T.I. (the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) or the Pentagon. Soon enough, the object releases over a dozen 15-mile wide saucers that fly over various capitals (London, Paris, Moscow, Washington D.C., etc) and important cities (like Hollywood, I mean, Los Angeles). One down-on-his-ambition scientist (Jeff Goldblum) figures out the signal is really a countdown, so he rushes to the White House where his ex-wife is serving as Press Secretary. He just barely convinces the president (Bill Pullman) to flee before the attack happens. All the alien ships attack at once, wiping out cities across the world in spectacular displays of fire and destruction. Fighter pilot Steve Hiller (Will Smith) leads his squadron against the Los Angeles ship where they utterly fail. He is able to knock down one alien fighter ship and takes the alien pilot captive. The Americans regroup at Area 51 (the US Government has been hiding an alien space ship fthere or decades) where they plot to defeat the alien menace.

The movie is a pastiche of other science fiction films, borrowing from War of the Worlds, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, and the television mini-series V. I had the problem (which I had twenty years ago when I saw it in the theater) of being reminded of all these other better films. The eventual solution is almost completely implausible and an awkward blending of War of the Worlds and Star Wars. Even so, the movie is enjoyable as an action romp if you set your brain in neutral and enjoy the ride.",1464912000,,1688,4.9020979020979025

Not only did this version have missing scenes, it also had added scenes that were not part of the theater release and for good reason.  The added scenes did not make sense nor did it flow (IMO).  If a person never saw the original, you would probably think the movie was okay.  I complained using the feedback button on the webpage for this movie, as I was logged in with my account email address.  However, the reply I received was nothing short of idiocy.  Amazon customer service said they could not resolve the issue since the email address which I used is not associated with an Amazon account.  Yet, the reply WAS sent back to the ONLY email address I have used for Amazon for the last 6 years.  And I made sure to specify the name of the movie....  Just wow is all I could think.  And on top of this, they made sure that it was no possible to reply to their email, since the reply bounces.  All I could think was just... ""wow"".

So if you already own the older copy and do not care about the bonus features disc, don't re-purchase this.  If you don't already own the blu-ray, definitely go for this one.

If you get the 4K version of the blu-ray, it has a DTS:X soundtrack, for those that have receivers with that technology.  And it sounds amazing.

After 20 years, you all must know the story line so I will skip right to what I myself would have liked to see in a simple review.
The transfer is superb on a Samsung UHD 65"" with equivalent Samsung up converting blu ray 3D player. On a par with quality of movies like The Martian and such. One big ding for the HD download only available in theatrical version (have email from Fox confirming same). The experience itself will not disappoint. Enjoy it like you have never seen it before!  Shame of Fox for the poor decision of going so far but not quite making it to the finish line with the download.

817836,3,6304233639,"Released in 1996, ""Independence Day"" (or ""ID4"") chronicles events as the earth is threatened by malevolent aliens who wipe out entire cities. Bill Pullman plays the US President, Margaret Colin his aid and Mary McDonnell his wife. Will Smith plays a hotshot pilot and Vivica A. Fox his babe. Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, James Duval and Brent Spiner are also on hand.

I saw this movie when it was released while on vacation during the height of its hype (incidentally, at the very theater in Aurora, CO, where The Dark Knight Rises Massacre would occur 16 years later). While fun and entertaining as most blockbusters are, it didn't match the hoopla, so I've had mixed feelings about it ever since.

On the positive side, the main characters are likable and there's a warmth to their relationships. I also like the feel-good quality of the movie in that it brings the whole world together to face a common enemy, despite our differences. In other words, it's not just Independence Day for America, but for Planet Earth. I also like the tie-in with Area 51, which shows that some thought was put into the script beyond just blowing up iconic buildings and whole cities. The scene where the captured alien utilizes Dr. Brakish Okun's vocal chords to speak is well done. Also, Margaret Colin looks great throughout.

What I don't like is the mixture of serious sci-fi with overdone comedy and the numerous ""Yeah, right"" moments. Comedy works with serious sci-fi/adventure/drama/thriller/horror as long as it's not overdone. The Terminator flicks are good examples, even Star Trek. In ""ID4"" too much of the comedy and inanities take you OUT of the story rather than take you IN. The comedic asides seem disjointed from the plot rather than enhancing it.

Despite the likable characters and warmth thereof, they too often come off empty and adolescent. The story focuses on the alien threat and human response so there's little character development of value. I enjoy a sci-fi flick even when its fantasy extends into the absurd and far-fetched, so long as there is some payoff -- some message of significance, some portrayal of what might or could possibly be, some character development that draws the viewer into the story and provides some basis for caring about what's happening. There's not enough of this in ""ID4.""

That said, there's a lot to enjoy as a shallow sci-fi blockbuster with a likable cast and some thrilling sequences. The key is not taking it too seriously since it doesn't take itself seriously.

The film is overlong at 145 minutes and was shot all over the USA with establishing shots from around the world.

I was 11 years old then. I'm a little older now, and my criteria has changed for what makes a film great. With that being said, I enjoyed it immensely. The explosions and thoughts of intelligent alien life made for quite the experience....

The actual acting was marginal, almost like a parody of the Independence Day I watched all those years ago. But the nostalgia of the good old days. It was a simpler time then...

20th century fox are finally releasing both versions over 2 Disc blu-ray Discs in standard blu-ray case
Disc 1 has the Theatrical version & the Unrated extended version which has all the Deleted scenes inserted back in the film
which makes it 10mins longer than the Theatrical version
both versions have been given the same 1080p HD transfers in 2:35:1 ratio with new 5.1 master audio mixes
the back cover says 7.1 master audio mix, well that's bulls*** or a print error both versions have 5.1 mix & 2.0 stereo mix only
i watched the extended cut version, the picture quality looks beautiful, very sharp & clear picture quality for sure
hardly no Grain or Dirt plus the sound quality has been boosted aswell which sounds excellent
the Theatrical cut i assume has been transferred over from previous blu-ray release anyway
Disc 1 extras are the usual audio commentary tracks taken from the very old 1999 special edition dvd
Disc 2 has all the special features, i mean all of them from the old special edition dvd
20th century fox have made lots of effort with the extras
there's a new 30min retrospective featurette A LEGACY SURGING FORWARD
which has new interviews with Director Roland emmerich, Producer Dean Devlin
Actors Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Bill Pullman, Vivica Fox give their recollections acting in the film
first 15 mins is about the recollections of the Actors on the film
the last 15mins is about the special visual effects in the film comparing 1995 Visual effects to 2016 effects
and the last 4 mins is aboout the new sequel
plus all the very old extras from the special edition dvd release
the 30min making of featurette CREATING REALITY which was filmed way back 1998 1:33:1 ratio
the HBO FIRST LOOK making of ID4-33mins from 1995 TV broadcast 1:33:1 ratio
ID4 invasion which is mockumentary on the Alien invasion 22mins
plus Gag bloopers reel, Stills Photo Gallery, the usual Theatrical trailer
so definitely time to throw out the very old special edition dvd
and gets this new 20th anniversary blu-ray reissue the picture qualities of both versions look amazing
much better than the old Digital remaster dvd for sure

818310,3,6304233639,"Independence Day is a film that is pretty average at best.  Will Smith seemed to be the It man of the moment at the time of the movies release.  The whole cast is full of pretty good actors who I liked seeing in other movies, but for whatever reason I seem to be the only person living in the United States who is not wildly crazy about this movie.  I always found the film highly overrated.  I would definitely not call this a classic sci fi movie, not even a great action movie.  But after frequent viewings the movie does get better over time.  I felt like the movie itself never lived up to the hype/promotion surrounding it.  The movie had all the effects but no real substance or story to back it up.

I actually prefer Will Smiths later films In Pursuit of Happiness, I-Robot, Hitch, films along those lines dealing with more serious subject matter.  But that is just personal preference.  For a popcorn action flick the movie will satisfy.  I think the movie never reaches the wow factor like the original Predator, Aliens, Die Hard, The French Connection, Dirty Harry, Terminator 2, Star Wars (Original Trilogy) action movies of the highest caliber.

Jeff Goldblum plays the mad scientist probably better than anyone in Hollywood.  He was pretty convincing for his part.  He was excellent in The Fly, and very good in Jurassic Park.  In this film he kind of plays the status quo although in a good way.

Bill Pullmen is also an excellent actor he probably should have won an Oscar for Spaceballs.  Here in this movie he is kind of ""eh"" as the president. Take it or leave it.

Independence Day was the 1996 summer blockbuster and it raked it money by the boatload.  It was similar to Titanic during that time period.  I remember my friends and all the media touting the movie as a must see.  There seemed to be a ton of buildup and hype for the movie.  After finally going to see the movie in a theater, I thought it was a pretty basic Sci Fi action movie with a bigger budget.  Nothing seemed to be overly special about it.

I always thought some of the acting and movie lines were pretty cheesy.  Anyone who has ever been stuck in L.A. traffic wishing the city would be obliterated its not a bad thing to see.  A similar film that I liked much better was 2009s District 9.  It had a very similar subject matter with a lot less cheese.  I also think the new Tom Cruise film Oblivion stole some of the ideas from Independence Day, but overall was a better movie just a lot slower.

Either way if you are a Will Smith fan you will probably like the movie.  I would stop short of calling it a classic.  I would rate the movie 3 stars.",1452038400,,2640,4.37037037037037

818762,4,6304233639,"Roland Emmerich.  The name is synonymous with epic-level disaster movies.  From Godzilla 2000 to 2012, Mr Emmerich has made the majority of a career of making movies on the edge of largest as possible.  He has created a model that has allowed the return of disaster movies and it started with Independence Day.

 The movie depicts a struggle between humanity-reeling from devastating attacks and highly advanced alien invaders.  The story follows a select group of these survivors enduring attacks on a genocide scale.  Mr. Emmerich was able to put together an all star cast to complement the Oscar-winning visual effects.

 Bill Pullman leads the cast as the President of the United States, a steady youthful figure who falls into the standard profile of a cinematic President.  Jeff Goldblum continued his trend of playing the scientist figure who suffers in life due to his lack of emotional expression.  Will Smith in a role that cemented his meteoric rise to acting stardom plays an air force pilot.  Costars include Robert Loggia, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and musician, Harry Connick Jr.

 While the movie's theme coincides with it's release weekend, July 3rd; the movie itself tends to pay homage to films such as Star Wars, The Day the Earth Stood Still and other classic science fiction movies.  This is done primarily through familiar camera angles and setups that were pioneered during the classic era.

 While Mr. Emmerich's cast does a good job of moving the plot forward and showing appropriate emotion as needed; Independence Day shows it's weaknesses during predictable plot twists and the lack of a singular identifiable antagonist.  The movie now nineteen years old has stood the test of time and compared with today's blockbusters still is able to show it's quality.",1440374400,,1785,5.0756013745704465

820205,5,6304233639,"Independence Day (1996)
  Will Smith has matured from the teen age Fresh Prince of Bel-Air into one of the most bankable movie stars of his time.  Independence Day begins his climb not simply to stardom, which kicked off a year earlier with the very successful Bad Boys, but an association with movies of eternal value.  I remember seeing Independence Day 20 years ago in the theater and the enormous impact the film had visually and emotionally.  Seeing it recently on TV reminded me just what a great film director Roland Emmerich can make and sometimes does make.
 German born Emmerich has directed some amazing films, including this one but also Moon 44, Stargate and The Patriot.  But sometimes he has a tin ear, artistically in my opinion, as shown in his films that I found hollow and unsatisfying such as Godzilla (1998), 2012 and 10,000 BC.  In Independence Day he manages to get everything just exactly right.
 The story races around the invasion by aliens looking for a nice rich planet to plunder.  First of course the local vermin (humans) have to be scrubbed off the globe.  Smith plays a Marine fighter pilot, perhaps the finest example of self confidence and heroism anywhere and Smith pulls it off with magnificent, intense aplomb.  When he knocks out an alien in a hand to hand fight he says Welcome to earth which a Marine might well say in the context.  There are many other excellent performances by first rate actors even down to the third level of characters.
 For instance, Brent Spiner (Data on Star Trek)  plays an area 51 scientist, isolated for security reasons for years, with precisely the right balance of psychological neediness and brilliance.  He accomplishes this acting feat in maybe a minute of dialog.  Fivica A. Fox plays the Pilot's love interest, beautiful and complicated.  Bill Pullman and Mary McDonnell are President and First Lady, again not central roles to the Marine major's story but solidly acted.  Judd Hirsh, Jeff Goldblum and Rober Loggia all bring something extra to this particular film.  Randy Quaid plays Russell Casse, a hero who we know has a sever drinking problem and may very well be mad as well.  None the less, the President sends him on a crucial mission.  Quaid does drunk and crazy so well we start to wonder about him.
 I have a theory that actors, writers, the vast crew that we never see behind the scenes and yes even the producers can sometimes sense when a project goes beyond a simple by the numbers building of a movie and aspires to the extraordinary.  I think it happened here.  Every one involved brought his A game to the park.
 That surely applies to the writing.  The dialog has a crispness about it layered by sincere authenticity.  Roland Emmerich himself did the writing himself, as has did for many of his films.  His writing partner I think added an extra dimension to the script.  Dean Devlin wrote and produced  for such TV shows as Leverage and the Librarians, both shows known for sharp dialog.  He also wrote for Stargate which Emmerich directed.
 Independence Day won an Oscar, which always makes it a movie one to watch.
 This rates a solid four and a half saw blades and a long two hours and 25 minutes.  It carries a PG-13 rating and my highest recommendations.
 Part of the genius of directing and producing movies of timeless value includes the knowledge of when to step back and let the camera role.  Most of the interchange among Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith and Judd Hirsch came from the actors themselves, not the script.  It worked wonderfully, as did the movie as a whole.",1432857600,,3573,4.7216828478964405

I have the DVD with the Special Edition choice, which I always click on. The theatrical edition is in Blu-ray and leaves some holes in the story.. I want to get the Special Edition in Blu-ray with the something like 10 minutes that the theatrical edition lacks. So, I watch the DVD version in a 1080p upconversion. Unfortunately, the DVD version in this package is of poor quality both in video and audio. I'd rather have the Special Edition in the Blu-ray format but don't know which of the Blu-rays has it. I have a suggestion to film producers. Trust the director. The director knows what the story is all about and the point to get across without leaving unanswered questions. Make the director's cut and the theatrical version the same thing.",1430524800,2,899,4.521472392638037

820560,5,6304233639,"This is by far one of my absolute favorite films, and thee film of the ""90's"" next to ""Jurassic Park"" & a few others.

 Basic plot: Every day normal people living in America from the poorest, middle class, the wealthy and up to the President of the United States himself wake up one fine summer morning to a catastrophic close encounter with super sized flying saucers strategically placed around different areas of the world.  This off the scale alien invasion alarms all who are mesmerized by this event, except the only man paying attention to the satellite fed data by cable television news & former MIT student physicist and mathematician David aka ""Jeff Goldboom"" (playing a similar role he had played in the timeless Jurassic Park, & Buckaroo Bonzi)

 Will Smith plays a hot shot U.S. Marine who wakes up in Los Angeles after sleeping over his girlfriend's house to see his world has changed forever, and his skills as a Marine combat pilot will be put to the ultimate test.

 Goldbloom figures out what these aliens true intention are, and during the course of the extreme action eventually finds himself teamed with Will Smith in Area 51 of all places, devising a super global co-operation plan for humanity to fight back against these super high technological monsters when all seems helpless and it is clear human kind is doomed.

 Randy Quad plays a drunken down and out retired Air Force pilot who has become a homeless bum, even rejected by his children, to find new positive meaning in both is life and service to his country and the people of Earth.

 The first act of ID4 is very cool, the giant flying saucers enter Earth's atmosphere then one hover's over Manhattan Island (where else would the galaxy's most powerful space creatures go except crazy New York?).  The President, Whitemore played by Bill Pulman, tries to ensure calm in society addressing to the world his desires for a peaceful dialogue with who ever these mystery creatures are.  Pullman's, along with Goldbloom's David and Marine Will Smith, is an awesome character I think many would wish an American President to be like character & guts wise.

 Act two is more complicated and might leave some people confused or not caring anymore plot wise on how what ever is left of America & her armed forces will unite with other countries to engage in an effective counter attack measure striking back against the ruthless & evil creatures from beyond the stars.

 The late Gene Siskel & late Roger Ebert had both given thumbs down to ID4 because the lack of plot and character development of the alien villains in the film, when one scene in particular an Alien mind melds with ""Star Trek"" star Brent Spiner (Mr. Data) expressing little articulation other then the screeches of an other worldly monster movie.  They had a very serious point with that issue that cannot be debated much, but never the less I found this film to be remarkably exciting regarding special effects stunts, and the very enjoyable (if not completely delusional & unrealistic) super battle between the military jet fighters against the aliens's ship & mini ""Tie Fighter"" like vehicles themselves.  Personally I thought the air battle scenes themselves had been the coolest part of the movie, allowing the film maker's imaginations to ponder how would a Navy F-18A Super Hornet fair against an alien spacecraft.

  The musical score is quite awesome, and very exciting espousing the joys and exuberance of the 4th of July holiday through the medium of a Hollywood blockbuster sci fi action epic.

 The science in the film is quit flawed, and the plot has some big holes one can drive a train through but never the less like other films such as , ""Avengers"", ""Star Wars"", & ""Terminator"" it really does not require hardly any intellectual insight for what this product is, simply a fun and enjoyable summer action movie.

 This movie is a must for me around the 4th July season, my favorite holiday, & I really never get tired of it though now that it is dated.  A lot of energy and new found exhilaration had hit the scene in the summer of 1996, making this movie one of the 90's best big money makers.  Two thumbs up and A for ""Independence Day"", a movie that stands alone with no need for a sequel.",1426636800,2,4253,4.734056987788331

821801,5,6304233639,"Whenever this film comes on TV I pause to watch it, or at least do the manly thing and frequently channel hop it it. There are only a handful of films I do this for. I have watched it twice in a month, once ignoring Rachel as she explained how the Democrats really won that last election.

This is a film that has been duplicated and spoofed. What makes this ""B"" action film so iconic are the numerous subplots that are done well and then brilliantly come together. The film type casts all the characters. In spite of that it takes time to build character to reinforce those stereotypes. Jeff Goldblum as a geeky scientist, Will Smith as a cocky pilot, and Randy Quaid as a nut case.

Even minor scenes such as the one with Harvey Fierstein were excellent as the individual scenes were well scripted. The special effects were top notch for 1996 and still beat today's low grade CG nonsense. The film produced a few memorable lines, and many memorable scenes.

On the down side...the speech given by the President at the end of the film was a bit dorky. I noticed the last time I watched it on a premium movie station, they had cut it to make time for ""Mar Attacks."" I am the guy who prefers it that way. Sorry. Also for purists, the film holds 100's of factual errors, continuity errors, and goofs. It seems they took so many takes shooting this film to ""get it right"" they ended up with things out of place from scene to scene. Most people won't notice.",1415232000,,1454,4.377777777777778

Set in the present day where technology rules and reigns, computers somehow turn on their owners and computer programming, worldwide. Resulting in the intended destruction of the whole of mankind and the entire planet Earth, as well. Space aliens who respond to these computers..., do as they are instructed, kill and destroy. While getting their invading space ships into their strategic placements, the hostile aliens observe and gather informational data while simultaneously blocking earthly communication systems, learning what they can and killing only, sporadically. That is, until the alien mothership decides to home-in over Washington,D.C.. Then, the United States President who once flew in the U.S. Air Force as a Combat Pilot, decides to step into his old Air Force uniform and together with a team of Jet Fighter Pilots, sets out to blow the hell out of the hostile aliens. But, having lined up with his target, he is left without any missiles. All the while, a computer scientist tries to upload a virus into the alien controlled computers to scramble the 'death code', and cancel the global command to 'kill', worldwide. That, and a direct hit from the Fighter Jet missile, would save the Earth and the whole of mankind. Then, comes the U.S. Presidents' exasperated and endearing plea, of: ""Doesn't anyone have any missiles, left?!"" Is heard and responded too, by the seemingly least and most unlikely of Fighter Pilots, flying around with ballistic missiles on his Combat Jet and ""late"" on top of that! But actually, he was 'just in time' with not one but two missiles, that were primed, pumped and ready to be fired off from aboard his U.S. Air Force Fighter Jet. Nearing the target, the first missile jams. And, in order to fire off the second missile, he had too have discharged the first one. So, with all of humanity and the entire world hanging in the balance, what does he, do? And, was the Computer Scientist and other U.S. Fighter Pilot simultaneously able to upload the crippling computer virus and cancel the order to 'kill' the whole of mankind? Watch and see, as this melodramatic action and adventure packed thriller that's filled with pockets of humor, is played out on your viewing screen. It's not a heavy drama that is played out between Earth and space, or a documentary. Rather, it is an enthralling fictional depiction of space creatures together with computers that mankind has programmed, turning on all of humanity and the entire planet and bring both to the brink of annihilation, by way of it's hostile, alien, mothership. And, how mankind with it's indestructible 'will to survive' fought back and saved the planet, as well. This Fourth-of-July, movie favorite, comes to it's audience in color with awesome special effects, on 2-DVD disc's complete with lots of Special Features. So, pop the popcorn and gather your family and friends, around. You'll like and enjoy this keeper. Especially, if you're an American :) !!! Nina Kish",1412985600,,3128,5.017307692307693

821994,3,6304233639,"Roland Emmerich has never been one of my favorite directors, mostly because he has been making the same type of movie now for about 20 years (not unlike Michael Bay in some respects). Still, he does have a great eye for visuals and can create spectacle like few others out there. INDEPENDENCE DAY was one of his first forays into the ""disaster"" genre, and as a large-scale blockbuster, it largely succeeds. Sure, there isn't a lot of attention paid to character or plot, but it delivers on the action and visuals. The ensemble cast is also great, and each person gets their own moment to shine. At first glance, one might be tempted to compare this to ARMAGEDDON, but I think that this film edges it out by a small margin. Both movies have essentially the same story beats, but the emotional arcs in this movie feel more genuine and there isn't a sappy Aerosmith ballad, either. The special effects in this movie are incredible, considering it came out in 1996 and I thought that the alien and spaceship designs were creative and nice to look at. Overall, I think that this movie has had, and will continue to have more staying power than ARMAGEDDON, if only because it did it first. Generally speaking, I enjoyed it, and if you're looking for a fun, turn-your-brain-off type of movie, you can't go wrong with this one.",1412208000,,1319,4.617021276595745

Both versions are widescreen (letterbox) and have either exhetended or new scenes including those that show Russell's family dynamics.  The aliens are coming and they are certainly not friendly.  After firebombing all the major cities and capitals , including Washington D.C.,  the Americans led by Bill Pullman playing an idealistic president, Jeff Goldblum as a computer expert beyond compare, and  Will Smith who is a cocky, yet competent pilot who can be serious when he needs to be.  After disastrous attempts to destroy the insectoid invaders, they come up with a way to destroy them from the other ship.  Back on Earth, ship to ship combat ensues and it appears they cannot destroy the smaller ship hovering above them.  That is when  Russell shows his true courage when he does a kamikaze like maneuver that destroys it and his selfless actions are relayed across the world  so the other hovering spacecraft can be destroyed.  The world now has an Independence Day all mankind can celebrate.  Science fiction fans and those who like films starring Will Smith will undoubtedly enjoy this film.  When the scene.where President. Whitmore is giving his impromptu speech before the brave pilots went to fight, even  the audience saluted and cheered!!",1410134400,,1396,5.034934497816594

This films is one of the best of the decade, not simply because it works so well in an all-over scheme, but it provides some kicks that no other film had up to then (1996). Aliens arrive in gigantic spaceships and blow up a bunch of major cities. That's all I need.

822760,5,6304233639,"This is one of those films you must have in your film library.
The plot is tissue thin, which makes it all the better.  We are invaded by advanced aliens who have no intention of dealing with us little creatures.  They are in ships of astonishing size and power and we have no chance, unless they have a flaw.  Therein lies the thread that developes the human response to stave off utter destruction.
Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are the lead characters in a large cast with huge vistas(mostly computer generated) showing the plight of Mankind when so confronted.  They are insufferable people and it's irksome that they do an 'I Spy' turn in being blase' and flip while controlling the fate of us all.  The film is saved by the supporting characters who take turns being funny, touching, or panicky.
This film is an answer to ET and the optimism it expressed.  As Stephen Hawking has warned us, it's by no means a given that the aliens we first contact will be warm and fuzzy.  And as this film portends, they might not only be unfriendly but equipped to show us how unfriendly.  The odds of us meeting a similar civilization and have 'wars' with them would be precisely -0-.
If there were two hidden gems in the film, they had to be Brent Spiner(Data from Star Trek-NG) and Harvey Fierstein.  They were absolutely brilliantly cast and a lot of fun...",1404691200,,1352,4.553719008264463

I have always understood the criticisms and I've never given a darn - I love ID4 and care not who knows. In the years since it has been available on DVD, it has been a 4th of July weekend tradition at my house. It's practically a ""Rocky Horror"" experience: we recite the script and talk back to the characters; but we still laugh, and cry, even as we acknowledge that we're being manipulated in the most blatant big-Hollywood-movie fashion.

If you hate ID4, then you hate it. Don't watch it. But if you like it, the Five Star Collection remains the only format that includes the extended cut. It's only 10 or so minutes longer than the theatrical version; but it's 10 or so minutes of footage that flesh out certain characters and relationships (in particular, Randy Quaid's character's relationships with his stepchildren) just enough to make them a bit less cardboard, making for a far better movie than the theatrical version.

823186,2,6304233639,"An unintended parody of Star Wars/ soap operas/ Men in Black/ disaster movies.

The whole thing is absurd without being funny or even interesting.

E.g, the ETs are octopus-like but they speak creditable English with a good accent. Does everyone in the universe speak English?

Eg. one of the pilots flying the fighter planes against the ETs is none other than the US President.

The pilot who finally saves humanity is a bum alcoholic (but a patriot) whose job is crop-dusting.

The crack US fighter is flying an ET fighter plane which he has never seen before this battle. Fortunately piloting a US jet prepares you to fly any UFO in the galaxy (as it happens, UFO panels have labels in English, the cosmos' universal language).

It is a FANTASTIC homage to Hollywood movie-making of the 1940s in that it worked the angle of strong characters who band together to over come odds, etc. and with a focus on the love relationships between the main characters. This one had the triple-whammy with the President and his wife who dies and the soldier and the computer guy and their ladies. The bad aliens are REALLY bad and it plays up peoples weaknesses but shows there's hope for everybody if they can let go of their fears. Wonderful piece of work.

I know a lot of people enjoyed this action-packed movie, but sadly it did not live up to my expectations.  It didn't take long for me to discover that there were others (i.e., my brothers and friends) who felt the same as me.  If you really think about it, the movie was pretty lame.  It started off with a blastliterallythen kind of fizzled out.  You have indestructible spaceships equipped with impenetrable force-fields that can be taken down with a parachute (yes, I said parachute!), a massive alien that gets knocked out with one punch (cheesy), and an intoxicated scientist who immediately sobers up the moment hes needed without any ill-effects (the last time I looked it took hours upon hours to sober up), to name a few.  Of course there were many more issues that I had with this film, but these just highlights some of the major issues that I had with the film.  From an entertainment perspective, the movie was moderately entertaining at times.  It just wasnt

Their mother ship is a quarter the size of Earth's moon, the smaller ships are 15 miles in diameter, and an army of space fighters. And all of them are protected by energy shields preventing any damage to them. A person watching this for the first time would wonder how Earth could possibly defeat such a deadly threat, especially when the 15 mile diameter ships use a weapon that decimate entire cities.

In the end, they are able to defeat the aliens by uploading a computer virus in the mother ship. After that, the entire planet unites in a final attack against the aliens. A crowning moment came when one man sacrifices himself to destroy the city destroying weapon, thus destroying the ship itself.

It's patriotic, has lots of action, some humor regarding the humans involved, bigger than life scenery, good alien creations, some romance and true love between family members.  One of best movies with alien beings that looked reasonable and not comic while being strange.  The world pulled together to face a common enemy.  The good guys won.  Can be enjoyed over and over, by the family.  Can appeal to lots of different interests.  It's a movie you can get involved in feeling the struggles, and the joy of winning, yet it is not emotionaly draining.  It's fun and exciting.",1385769600,,596,4.7745098039215685

He is 100% a man, (a huMAN) and a Marine.  Plenty of action, both cg, and live.  There is violence, but it is thoroughly justified by the aliens' actions.

I do own the Standard Def DVD 5 Star Collection of Independence Day but this is not a side by side comparison of the video/audio quality of the two.  That said, I bought Independence Day on Blu Ray for $7.99 in Walmart's bargain bin.  How bad could things be for such an inexpensive cost.  Well, that depends upon  your expectations.

The Standard Def 5 Star Collection had both  the theatrical release and the extended version along with a ton of cool extras like alternate endings and alternate scenes which I always enjoy far more than endless commentaries and performers telling the camera how great every other performer or director was.

The Blu Ray has only the theatrical version , a useless Ultra Violet download which will not go into iTunes, a silly game where you find objects during the course of the film and it brings you to additional scenes, more commentaries, a trivia track and trailers.  Not impressed with these extras at all.  This is also the first time I have mentioned the extras in a film before I ever got to the film's review in the first place.
Okay, here we go...the Theatrical Release of Independence Day on Blu Ray
  VIDEO.....The transfer is really very clean with good contrast, realistic lighting and skin tones.  Though much of the color grading produces a softer effect unlike the color popping you might find in a Transformers movie, the color reproduction is very good.  I saw no artifacting whatsoever nor stair stepping in any part of the film.  The standard def version was pretty clean and watchable so I do not see a massive difference between the two.  4 stars on the Video.
  AUDIO...The lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 is the star with great audio steering and panning for both the front and rear sound stages.  The audio levels are very good and there is a fine balance of volume between the dialogue, foley audio and soundtrack; no need to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control.  The lossless audio creates a very transient bounce of audio as it moves around the sound stage and your LFE channel will definitely get many opportunities to work out.  5 Stars on Audio

The question remains, should you wait until there is a remastering of the film and the extended version also put on Blu Ray or settle for an excellent transfer of just the theatrical release without any of the extras that came with the 5 star collection.  There is a part of me that wishes I had waited but then I might have found myself waiting forever for that to happen and it hasn't happened yet.  Only you can make that decision and I have decided to keep both the Standard Def and the Blu Ray in my collection.  When they come out with the extended version on blu ray, I would probably buy that and then give away the SD copies.

All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.

Not exactly a great film, it nonetheless serves the purpose it was designed for: a rousing, gung ho, jingoistic, alien butt kicking sci-fi flick.  With no shortage of macho posturing from the likes of Harry Connick Jr. (a cringe worthy performance providing the sourest note in the film), Will Smith (I like this movie in spite of Smith's appearance), and Robert Loggia as General William Grey.  While that type of stale braggadocios can be expected from the likes of the military portrayed, it isn't always appreciated as great dialog.  It is, in fact, quite corny and not a little silly.  Fortunately, the action and the Oscar winning special effects make up for what's lacking in pesky areas like character development.  In those instances, the personalities of the actors takeover and shine forth (Harvey Fierstein, Judd Hirsch, Adam Baldwin, and Brent Spiner).  Regardless of its shortcomings, this is an enjoyable fun ride.  (I was happy to learn that there might be two sequels in the works.

825203,5,6304233639,"When I first decided to watch this movie, I was hoping that it wouldn't be a flop, or something boring about aliens. To my surprise, I was impressed with the acting performance of Will Smith, and basically the entire cast. Acting was absolutely superb. The story entertains from beginning to end, and I mean from the very beginning. The pics of the spaceships and aliens are astonishing, and sound effects are awesome. ""Independence Day"" is not only about fighting for the right to live, but within this story are also special relationships of different people. A father, who bonds with his children, and at the end becomes a hero. Will Smith and his relationship with a woman and her young son, who survived the horrific alien attack. The president, who lost his wife, during the invasion, and bonds with his young daughter. Another couple who reunite during the terror of alien attacks, and who work hard against the invaders to prevent the end of mankind. I have watched this thrilling movie over 15 times, because I enjoy the acting. There are emotional moments that bring silence, and tears to your eyes. In addition, there are extremely funny moments such as Will Smith screaming at an unconscious alien, while dragging him through a burning desert. This scene is laugh-out-loud entertainment. Then there are very serious moments, because we wait until the very end to find out who survived from the final attack. Exciting, chilling, and fun-filled entertainment. Highly recommended!",1364256000,2,1489,5.008064516129032

I saw it in theaters the night before it was officially released, and it blew my mind!

Look, by today's standards the effects are (somewhat) dated, this was the 90's, and CGI was starting to be used more and more (unlike today where it's practically the standard).  The movie has everything that a movie of this type should have: action, humor, good acting, a decent plot, and -POPCORN!

As I've stated for ""Battleship"": this is NOT ""2001..."" -there are plot holes and goofy things you'll find wrong with it, but if you watch it for what it is; an ""aliens invade us"" movie and not worry about being too serious, you might just enjoy!",1348876800,,841,4.441558441558442

825725,3,6304233639,"We've been watching the 1996 DVD for 16 years, and it gave up the ghost.  The price was right, so why not get the Blu-ray?

PROS:  The visual clarity and detail were obvious immediately.

CONS: The menu was nifty, but they never created anywhere for it to go.  It may as well have been an ol' DVD menu.

We had to crank up the sound much higher than with the DVD to get the theater experience.  We didn't notice any additional clarity in the sound until we were listening to the music during the credits.

From our WHAT THE HECK WERE THEY THINKING??!! department, a minimum of three scenes were cut from the DVD we'd been watching all these years:

Judd Hirsch is driving, against the panicky traffic flow, with Jeff Goldblum riding shotgun, when they experience a near head-on collision, forcing them to crash through wooden barriers and careen down an exit.  This scene is absent, with them having a nice Sunday drive, winding up off the highway and on a side street.

In the scene at the White House, Margaret Colin's character tells Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch, ""Don't touch anything,"" in the Oval Office.  Later, when everyone runs out to attend to the creature, the techs leave Jeff Goldblum alone in the spacecraft, telling him, ""Don't touch anything,"" which prompts him to touch every reachable surface.  This comedic moment was cut.

While Vivica A. Fox is driving survivors through the rubble, a street preacher (Barry Del Sherman) has this exchange with Vivica:
Street Preacher: The end has come! He speaketh his word and the end hast come!
Jasmine Dubrow: Hop on! We're headed out to El Toro.
Street Preacher: You cannot defy what has come. It is the end!
This scene, too, was cut from the Blu-ray.

A fun homage to the ""Samuel Z. Arkoff Presents American International Pictures' Hubcap-on-a-String-Against-a-Blue-Sky-Background"" black & white alien invasion epics of the 1950s, INDEPENDENCE DAY has all the requisites: The goofy scientist who's been locked in his lab too long, the cynical government official, the smart general, the President willing to save the world by leading the good guys into battle, the cocky superheroic fighter pilot, the discredited scientist who saves the world by discovering that the aliens are fatally allergic to room freshener, the wise elder, the washed-out nutcase claiming to have been abducted by the aliens, and the pretty girl who knows it all (as an added bonus it actually has TWO).

It also has really yicky-poo-poo slimy yuck aliens who are a cross between arthropods, cephalopods, and human beings. They want to do nothing more than kill us, of course, and to do so they have a Destructo-Ray of some sort that makes Hiroshima look like a clambake.

After the Y.-P.-P.S.Y. Aliens wipe out four-fifths of humanity, the Discredited Scientist (played by Jeff Goldblum) comes up with his world-saving idea, which inevitably requires that he and Cocky Superheroic Fighter Pilot (Will Smith) have to sneak aboard the aliens' orbiting hubcap while the World-Saving President (Bill Pullman), who, by the way hates Discredited Scientist, leads the rest of the world into an alien-distracting battle. The day is saved by Washed-Out-Nutcase (Randy Quaid---thanks commenter!---who is maybe not acting at all). And it all happens on---wait for it!---the FOURTH OF JULY!!!!  Yay, America!

Think these are spoilers? Don't despair. If you watched CREATURE FEATURES, CHILLER THEATER, or FRIGHT NIGHT growing up (or MST 3000, if you're younger), you've seen INDEPENDENCE DAY in one form or another. No cliche is left unused. No gaping plothole is filled in.

And even if you've seen INDEPENDENCE DAY itself, it's a picture that, miraculously, never wears itself out. You can watch this thing 500,000 times and it's still amusing, exciting, and even, cornily, moving in spots. And though it's corny and flaky and even corn-flaky, it never fails to entertain, and that's the sign of a REALLY GREAT FILM. It's the CITIZEN KANE of its genre.

Considering that it was budgeted at $75,000,000 and that it's brought in almost $820,000,000 since its release---we can assume that a few people have seen this movie and liked it. And, oh wait! It's on AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO too!",1343606400,2,2720,5.14027149321267
825734,2,6304233639,"I saw ""Independence Day"" (here after ID) way back 16 years ago when it exploded onto theaters.  I haven't seen it since, on cable or TV or otherwise (and have no burning desire to do so again); therefore this brief (by my standards, anyway) review will be based on my memory of that ""epochal"" event.  As a synopsis, I would hazard to guess that my opinion of the movie is probably summed up by the majority of the 1-star and 2-star Amazon reviews of this movie.  Superficially, this alien invasion movie is exciting, loud, and suspenseful, as long as you keep your brain from participating.  However, once you start thinking about the cliches, inconsistencies, stereotypes, inexplicable coincidences, and blustering macho, xenophobic, Ameri-patriotism the 1- and 2-star posters have so colorfully and thoroughly illustrated, you realize ID is a flashy but useless piece of junk - like a Cadillac without an engine.

  Of all the illogical concepts ID heaps upon us, I think the most irritating one is this:  Earth is invaded by astronomically large spaceships and pod fighters with unfathomably superior alien technology.  Later in the movie, the captured alien admits that purpose of their arrival was simply to decimate the Earth and its inhabitants.  THEN WHY DID'NT THE ALIENS DO JUST THAT AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVED, INSTEAD OF FUTZING AROUND AND DESTROYING A BUILDING HERE AND THERE (E.G.THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING  AND THE WHITE HOUSE) WHY?

David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) who is a communications expert sees a hidden transmission in the TV signals overriding the communication satellites. He tries to tell his ex-wife who works for the President of the United States but she blows him off thinking he doesn't really know what is going on. Suddenly dozens of large flying saucer shaped craft the size of a large city drop out of the mother ship and hover over the major cities of the world.

Meanwhile Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is a military pilot on leave and gets up out of bed to see a flying Saucer as large as downtown Los Angeles hovering over the city. He leaves his girlfriend to return to the military base as he is recalled for immediate action and security....

What follows is a pretty good Sci-Fi movie with some laughs built in. You have to take some of the movie with a grain of salt as parts are really far stretched but what good Hollywood movie isn't these days. The special effects are pretty good and the story line is not bad if you take out the alcoholic crop duster that can fly an F 18 Hornet with no flight training since the Vietnam War.

There is a lot of action, special effects and some decent plot lines within the movie. If you just look at it as 2 hours of entertainment you will enjoy it. It shows mankind rising up in the face of total destruction at the hands of aliens who want our planet.

This movie has aged well, it does a much better than average job of telling the story of an alien invasion. Since its release there have been numerous additional films based on this topic, most of which do not really measure up to ID4.

Clearly Judd Hirsch, Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith carry away acting honors, presumably because their hallmarked styles could not be repressed entirely by their stereotyped roles. The stunts, impressive on normal TV must be  pretty spectacular on updated equipment. The score does an excellent job of reinforcing and enhancing the plot, and the supporting actors do a good job in roles that were well delineated from early in the life of films. As for depth of thought, enlightenment on the problems of mankind, the dilemmas inherent in weapons of mass destruction already available to us, forget it, this was not a vehicle for initiating thoughtful deliberation about them.

A monstrous starship had approached the Earth from behind the Moon; mankind had no idea what was coming until its transmissions were picked up after it rounded the moon.  It decelerated, settled into a synchronous orbit, and dispatched dozens of enormous, dark, organic, blister-shaped ships which dove toward the Earth . . . .

They plunged into the atmosphere, friction heated them to hell-fire temperatures, until they became cocooned in a fiery trail of clouds.  Frightened citizens of Earth looked up, unable to take their eyes away from the roiling clouds approaching their cities.  When the blister ships emerged, they glided overhead, darkening the sky, an eerie twilight on the horizon . . . .

The plot is fairly straight forward, aliens are here and they do not come in peace. With their overwhelming technology (remember, they brought their entire civilization light-years across the vastness of space in ships 1/6 the mass of the moon), they should be able to easily wipe out mankind and just take what they want, but they obviously didn't count on Will Smith (a very self confident fighter pilot) and Jeff Goldblum (an under achieving technical genius) to team up against them. There are a lot of plot devices to move the show along, mostly in the form of a string of improbable coincidences, stereotypical characters, and unlikely technical wizardry.

All that taken into consideration, this is still an incredibly watchable and enjoyable movie (we own it on DVD, Blu-Ray, and have even used ""On-Demand"" to watch it on my PC when stranded in an airport).

826116,5,6304233639,"During the hot Summer of 1996, my siblings and I saw Independence Day on a Tuesday morning in a cool, air-conditioned movie theater. Director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin struck gold with this action packed popcorn movie. Human beings spend three, daunting days fighting off malevolent alien beings! Roland Emmerich shows off his love for 1970's disaster films and 1950's sci/fi B-movies. ID4 is one of the movies that turned Will Smith into a movie star. David Arnold's ID4 music score is very loud, epic, and energetic. A year later, he wrote music for the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies(1997). I bought a David Levinson action figure from the unsuccessful line of Independence Day toys! Some TV stations show this film during the 4th of July. There was a Mad Magazine spoof called 'It's Depends Day'.
 ID4 does have some detractors. They claim the film is ""mindless"" and it ""shows human stereotypes fighting alien stereotypes"". I guess it's true. The DVD version of ID4 preserves the 1996 theatrical version and a special, longer, re-edited version of the film.

826118,3,6304233639,"So I'm a little slow sometimes.  I watched Independence Day the other day for the first time in years, and finally noticed that the invading aliens were a metaphor for mankind despoiling and stripping the earth.  Jeff Goldblum's scientist character is one of those nags constantly pestering people to pick up their pop cans and rattling on about saving the earth.  And there are the aliens, here to take earth's riches, just like we humans are doing now.

The movie's green obsession takes it down a spectacularly dumb alley.  When all else fails to stop the invaders, a nuclear strike is ordered up with great reluctance by the doofus president.  The scientist basically has a two-headed cow, because of the havoc a nuclear bomb will unleash.  Mind you, the aliens have already wiped out a couple of hundred million humans at least, and everyone knows after the alien/president mind meld that the invaders will strip earth of everything it has anyway.  But the scientist whacks out nonetheless.  Better mankind should die for nothing than that it make a mess defending itself.

The president joins in this nonsense.  (Giveaway alert, if you have no idea what happens in the movie.)  When the nuclear cruise missile attack fails, he simply gives up and refuses a mass attack of serious proportion.  Now this makes a lot of sense.  Facing certain defeat and extinction of humanity, and knowing exactly what the invaders have in mind (remember the mind meld?), the president just calls the whole thing off as the spacecrafts go about their business erasing cities.  I can gladly suspend belief for entertainment's sake, but even a fictional movie must make some sense.

I.D. had state-of-the-art special effects (in its day), solid acting, humor, and action.  It's fun to watch.  It's just that it makes no sense at crucial junctures and pushes a preachy message at the same time.  An entertaining movie with a few serious brain-dead parts.",1305158400,,1938,4.925925925925926

This movie makes me think of Demi Moore's ""Striptease"": coulda/shoulda/woulda...go for the biggest possible gate and later for the reputations of the performers.

There *are* some very entertaining scenes, however: Will Smith ejects from his fighter plane and runs towards a downed UFO - he punches out the alien inside, then lights up a stogie - ""Now that's a close encounter!"". Another fun sequence is at ""Area 51"", where the President encounters a humanoid still hanging out after about 45 years; and a scientist who's equally...spaced out. These serio-comic expositions really work; loaded with timely symbolism.

 The film is about a group of aliens who wreck havoc on mankind, killing people and destroying buildings, as humans fight desperately to save themselves from being destroyed by these evil forces. ""Independence Day"" is a combination of the movies ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"", and many of the neat disaster epics from the seventies, but produced on a much more high-scaled level where money was obviously no object for the studio: the producers wanted to make an extraordinary ""disaster"" film, and they succeeded. Both terrifying and jaw-dropping, ""Independence Day"" leaves the viewer wondering ""could this really happen someday?"".

To me, it is a worthwhile upgrade because overall, it is a nice improvement over the standard DVD.  Certain well-lit non-action scenes look really incredible in blu-ray.  Other action or FX shots just look pretty standard.  Overall, though, it is an improvement.  Sound is good, too.  Only complaint that I had was that the scene menu was really slow and it tooks eons to scroll between scene previews.  This could just be my player though.

Sadly, that scene where Russell flies his biplane into the alien's giant laser is not on here, but that's not that surprising because this disc is pretty short on special features.  If you are looking for the extended version, it's not here.  But for me, the fact that this disc doesn't have it or many other features isn't that big of a deal.  Most of the deleted scenes were deleted with good reason (including the subplot of Russell's youngest son having some disease and not being his biological child...or something).  Honestly, ID4 is one of those movies that I don't really want to think about that much, so I don't care that there isn't some one hour behind the scenes thing about how they made a miniature White House to blow up.

826284,4,6304233639,"More then a decade after the release of 90's mega-hit Independence Day, I'm still amazed, and amused at the people who insist on questioning the science behind. I have heard it all: The physics are wrong, those ships couldn't possibly hover above those cities without causing damage, military jets can't do that and don't even get me started on the nukes... you get the picture. It really brings a smile to my face. Then there are those who question the film's virtues on plot, story, characters and acting. Those people (even if they have a point) also make me laugh.

Quite simply, those people simply don't get it. Independence Day is not, and was never meant to be ""scientificaly accurate"". In fact, it was never meant to be taken as high drama or be an award contender (although those special effects deserve mention). Independence Day is a campy, tongue-in-cheek tribute to 50's sci-fi and you know what? I'm fine with that. It's the perfect pop-corn film. Before Roland Emmerich found success (thanks to this film) and tried to make the end of the world his ongoing obsession (along with taking himself too seriously) he made two gems that us movie fans will love forever: Stargate and this film. The merits and flaws of this film have been discussed ad nauseaum so let's look at the blu-ray release.

First the transer which, I think, is pretty outstanding. Considering this film was made way before the advent of HD, the film looks quite beautiful. Colors are bright and natural, textures are well defined. The military uniforms are a perfect example of this. There are a few flaws here and there but nothing major. There is some grain but I'm fine with that. It is film after all. A scene or two might look soft but again, unless you are looking for the specifics you will hardly notice. Even the effects, which were done right before the onset of CGI hold up very well. All the model work, motion control shots and blue screen compositions look seamless. This is especially noteworthy because High Definition has a tendency to reveal stuff that filmakers thought would stay hidden thanks to the ""character"" of traditional film. In this case, the hiding was very well done or the people who transfered the film really did their homework. By the way, if you own any type of Home Theater setup, get ready to get your senses attacked. The mix is pretty outstanding too.

On the special features front, this release has a major flaw: It does not include the extended version of the Ultimate Edition DVD. It only includes the theatrical version which is fine but here is the thing: The best extra by far in the package is the pop-up track that gives you little details of the film and it's production as you watch the film. The track is very insightful and fans of the film will really enjoy learning all the details, bloopers and stories. The problem is the track mentions the extended scenes of the DVD several times and makes you wonder why the heck didn't they just include them. In fact there is a lot of extras missing that were in the Ultimate Edition. One could argue that some of that stuff is outdated but they did include the original commentary track from the DVD and that certainly has not aged well. So what gives? My guess? Independence Day: Super-Mega-Ultra-Ultimate Blu-Ray 15th(or 20th) Anniversary Edition. You know how it goes.

Independence Day is a very entertaining film and it has aged very well. The transfer is awsome and looks great in HD. Some might hesitate knowing that there will probably a bigger release with more and newer features down the road but in my opinion the price of this blu-ray disc has come down enough to not feel too guilty about it.",1263513600,13,3687,4.676425269645609

826405,4,6304233639,"This review is for the blu-ray version of the movie.  I've found that the video quality is significantly better than the DVD.  However, it is important to keep in mind that this movie was made in 1996, and some of the effects that looked cool then are less impressive in high-def.  The sound is also wonderful.

As to the film itself, if you haven't seen it, it's a typical Roland Emmerich summer blockbuster movie.  A lot of landmarks getting blown up, unlikely everymen become heroes, etc.  The are plot holes aplenty, which are glossed over by a rising musical score.  The characters are thin and many are nothing more than caricatures.  Regardless, it's amusing and impressive in parts and is a good ""popcorn movie"" that offers 2 1/2 hours of mostly mindless entertainment.

Some reviews have complained that the blu-ray disc does not have the ""extended version"" on it.  This is true, and normally this would upset me.  However, I've watched both the theatrical and extended cuts on my DVD, and I firmly believe the theatrical version is the better cut.  It's better paced and doesn't get lost with storylines relating to minor characters you really don't care about.  The extended edition simply feels bloated.  Also, on the DVD the scenes added in the extended version are of a noticeably lesser quality than the remainder of the film, which is distracting, so I really don't miss not having the extended cut on blu-ray.",1263254400,6,1426,4.814814814814815

826410,1,6304233639,"The most positive aspect of the movie was the fight scenes.  I have to say that the fight scenes were very well done, and I actually found them preferable to the space fights in the newer Star Wars movies which are famous for their special effects.  There was an element of believability in the Air Force vs. Aliens which minimized the need for suspended disbelief.  Another strong point in the movie was the way they depicted the reactions and mass hysteria to the aliens hovering over the cities.  The looting, and the congestion due to a disorderly panic induced exodus was a very believable and realistic reaction.  Finally, the blasting away of those alien worshiping hippie types was a nice touch, which also added realism.  My beliefs about aliens notwithstanding, if a group of aliens came to earth in a conspicuous fashion, no matter how menacing, twisted, or downright evil they appeared there would certainly be groups of hippies coming out with the ""take us with you"" blather.

Now for the weak points...  To make for easier reading I am going to divide the negative elements into subsections.

The Plot:

The best way I could describe the movie, is that it was like a comedy or spoof with all the humorous elements taken out.  I did not laugh once throughout the entire thing.  I have never cared much for Jeff Goldbloom, never found him funny, and Will Smith is usually funny, but not in this movie.  The humor, like every other attempt to generate an emotional reaction from me, was forced.  The plot is simplistic and dry.  The story is that a hostile civilization is coming to earth to eliminate humanity and drain all of earth's resources.  The aliens go to a planet, use up all the resources, then move on and repeat the process elsewhere.  They begin by destroying some major cities, and then they reposition themselves to destroy more.  They can't be stopped because they have forcefields, but fortunately Jeff Goldblooms character manages to create a virus to sabotauge their computers, they upload it, and then they blow up all the aliens.  That is the plot, a simple story which could be wrapped up in less than an hour.  Instead, they choose to prolong it, and they way they do so is by adding lots of characters and showing how they all react to the crisis, which amounts to many long protracted scenes of boring pointless dialogue.  One thing that was never addressed is what sort of resources the aliens were after.  Are they after material resources or energy resources, or both.  If all they are after is ore and building materials they could find that anywhere, there is no reason for them to go to earth or any other inhabitable planet for that.  If they are looking for an environment to grow crops and raise livestock (food production), then they would need a habitable planet, but the resources involved in that are renewable, so there would be no need for them to continue migrating unless they are either explorers or migrating to compensate for a growing population.  If they were looking for habitable worlds to compensate for a growing population then that would actually make sense, and it would allow the aliens to be a continual threat even if the humans won because they are in the business of colonizing.  Instead what they have is an enormous plot hole which probably exists for the purpose of getting across some environmentalist message.

The Characters:

I did not identify with a single one of the characters, nor did I particularly care about any of them.  Having lots of characters does not work for a movie.  For a movie it is ideal to have about two or three main characters, plus a few ancillary characters.  The reason for this is that in order to generate concern or an interest in the characters there has to be character development.  It takes time to develop characters, and the more characters there are the less time there is for development.  I did not care whether Will Smith or Jeff Goldblooms characters got blown up with the alien space ship or survived.  I also did not care if Will Smith's stripper girlfriend survived, nor was I in any way moved by their wedding.  They interjected that wedding as time filler, why not just have them be married at the onset of the movie, and give her some other occupation besides being a stripper?  Then they would not have had to waste time with a wedding.  The only time having lots of characters works well, is when you have a TV series.  A TV series offers more time to properly develop the characters and build up concern for them on the part of the viewer.  The proper way to develop characters is to show them working together, interacting, solving a variety of problems over an appropriate time span (as opposed to cramming a lot into a short period), and gradually making their nuances evident over time.  In the first episode of Battlestar Galactica I did not care if any of the characters died, and some of them I actually hoped would die, but as the series progressed and the characters interacted with one another, faced different problems and overcame them, and as background information was added at moments where it was immediately pertinent, I came to care about the characters.  In Independence day it was as if they said, ""here are a bunch of characters, you don't know anything about them but you should care about them and their plight...""  Well, I don't.  I did not care at all when the presidents wife died, she was just there.  They added her in and gave her a death scene to add drama and create an emotional stir, but I had no connection to the character because of the complete lack of development, and I didn't watch that movie for drama I watched it because I wanted to see a good story plus some cool fight scenes.  There were parts of the movie were I considered fasting forward through the lame drama and boring speeches to get on to the scenes where something is actually happening.

The Aliens:

The design of the aliens was highly unoriginal and cliche.  They basically took the stereotypical alien design, and added a large useless protuberance at the back of the head.  Maybe they tinkered around with the geometry of the limbs, but it was hard to tell because the only full body shots of the aliens were the ragged remains of the crash victims.  But regardless of that, the same overused cliche of the grossly disproportionate head relative to their bodies.  They also have the same overused, repulsive, demonic, stereotypical and cliche ""alien"" face.  I put ""alien"" in quotations because I do not at all believe that the stereotypical ""alien"" face is what aliens would be like if they existed in real life.  On the surface, I would say the grossly enlarged head relative to the body is based off of evolutionism, which has often taught that brain size, and consequentially head size, will increase in the future as it has allegedly increased in the past.  However, I also say that the features are demonic because there are ancient cultures which have used those features to represent evil spirits.  The fact of the matter is, it's overused, it's ugly, it's unoriginal, and it's a poor design.
The structure of the aliens is a poor design because there is no way they could walk.  The size of the necks could not support the weight of their grossly misproportioned head.  And the large pointless protuberance only exasperates the problem.  It is true that the tricerotops had a large bony protuberance emanating from the back of the skull, but that animal had a much larger body and thicker neck.  To hold up a head that size and to be able to turn it would require a much thicker more muscular neck.  The people who ""designed"" the aliens could argue that the aliens typically operate in low to zero G settings normally, except that given that an abrupt turn could easily result in a snapped neck.  It's a poor design, and it's unoriginal.  It is also insulting to my intelligence that they expect I would buy into the notion that such an absurd and poorly designed creature could even walk.

The Message?:

There is a question mark because I am not 100% certain that this movie even had a message, but most movies usually do and there were some elements that could be inferred as messages.  What I saw in this movie was a makeshift one world government formed, and it appeared to me as though one world government was being touted as a good thing.  I am 100% opposed to one world government, and I do not particularly care for propaganda which advocates that in any form.  When the president was giving his speech about a world ""independence day"" it almost initiated a gag reflex in me.  In real life a one world government will inevitably lead to a regime worse than Hitler, with the added bonus of having no place to flee to.  I am very leery of anyone or anything which so much as appears to advocating a one world government.  Generally people who advocate a one world government hate freedom.

Conclusion:

This movie is not worth the time, it's a complete waste.  If you feel that you just HAVE to know about it because of peer pressure, then just read my synopsis and watch the fight scenes.  Skip over everything in between because it is slow, boring, pointless time filler.",1260057600,,9227,4.654107473749228

826494,1,6304233639,"Let's examine the premise of this movie for a moment, shall we? Extraterrestrial craft have been visiting the earth for millennia. There were craft painted onto walls by prehistoric peoples. The nearest star is four light years away, meaning at the level of technology possessed by humans currently, it would take centuries at best for them to arrive here even from the NEAREST of an infinite number of stars in the universe. So, they must have craft that can considerably exceed the speed of light. If any civilization in possession of that kind of hugely advanced technology had wanted to destroy humans, it could easily have done so long ago. However, they have not.
  No, dear people, the threat is not extraterrestrials. It is ourselves. Humans are doing a magnificent job of threatening the survival of humanity, thank you very much. Films like this, not to mention its upcoming sequel by another name, are nothing but a low-ball attempt to whip up a frenzy of militaristic paranoia so that people won't notice that they're being robbed blind every day by the same military-industrial complex portrayed as our great salvation in movies like this. In fact, I suspect that that same establishment had some major role in the making of this film.
  Do you want to be horrified? Leave this film behind and look instead at what humans are doing to their habitat and to one another. THERE is the real shocker! Movies like this do nothing but dumb down the masses, who unfortunately seem to like being spoon-fed this kind of mindless, idiotic drivel.",1252800000,3,1548,4.8522727272727275

Director Roland Emmerich, who has pumped out exciting sci-fi like Stargate and not so great sci-fi such as 10,000 B.C., combined a 4th of July holiday with an alien invasion story.

The plot attempts to gain our sympathy with broken relationships, healing and desire as well as attracting our fanboy side with lots of explosions and air fights.  The aliens themselves are almost inconsequential.

The film has plot inaccuracies and just plain silliness: uploading a computer virus to an alien craft that has Windows -- how cool is that? Or an unknown force field technology that somehow shows up on Earth's radar screens.

But despite the quibbles on the hackneyed dialogue and inaccurate science, there is a lot to say about Bill Pullman's acting. He is an ineffective president who not only rises to the occasion, but takes command and even goes into battle himself.

The drunk test pilot who sacrifices himself and regains his children's respect.

The old Black & White Day the Earth Stood Still plays momentarily on a TV screen in homage.

Most of those wanting to buy this film on Bluray are those who have already seen it and liked it, so I won't comment on the movie content itself, but rather the technical and supplemental aspects of this release.

I borrowed a friend's copy of the BD version of ID4 just a few weeks ago, as I was contemplating whether to add this to my small but growing blu-ray collection. The picture and audio are superb, and watching this on my new LCD at 1080p with the lossless DTS-MA audio track really transported me back to the July of '96, when I watched this on the big screen. This movie has certainly aged well these thirteen years, and the special effects are still terrific even today. While watching, I was pretty much set on adding this to my collection.

That is, until after I finished watching the movie and wanted to see the extras in HD.

The DVD version I have contains two discs and a lot of extras, including an alternate ending, making-of feature, trailers, and cast/crew interviews. Sadly, in this BD release there are none, not even in standard definition. The only ""extra"" is a commentary track, which, as an another reviewer already pointed out, is laughably outdated. At $25, I would expect more than just a movie and nothing else.

The Dark Knight BD had two discs plus a digital copy for the same price-  that was justifiable, even in this economy. This... isn't.

FOX is notorious for double-dipping their DVD and Blu-ray releases. I would imagine that a two-disc or dual-layered ""special edition"" version will come out over the next year or so.

It isn't a movie to watch for social commentary or anything like that: pop it in, grab some beer and pizza and enjoy.

The Blu Ray version of the movie is *very* impressive.

This particular movie helps show how nice hi def can be on a big screen, better than most. There are details I just never could have made out on DVD.

826787,3,6304233639,"Before superpowered crimefighting men in tights dominated the summer movie landscape, there were asteroids (Armageddon, Deep Impact), tornadoes (Twister), and giant lizards (Godzilla) destroying national landmarks that caused people to flock to their air-conditioned movie theaters in the summer months. But the film that seemingly started it all was 1996's Independence Day.

Directed by Roland Emmerich and produced by Emmerich and his partner (or in most cases, co-offender) Dean Devlin, the ""masterminds"" behind the so-so sci-fi film Stargate. While on the press junket for Stargate, they were questioned about their belief in aliens, which they responded that one day we may wake up to find alien spaceships in the sky. At that moment, the concept for their next film was born.

Some call Independence Day ""the Star Wars of the 90's"", but Independence Day lacks the religious mysticism and homages to Westerns and samurai films. What it does have is a love for old sci-fi B-movies like The Day the Earth Stood Still, movies made to be more fun than based in heady subtext or scientific fact.

The story takes place over the span of three days: July 2nd, July 3rd, and July 4th. The film begins on July 2nd with the ominous shadows of the invaders' massive spaceships slowly enveloping everything they pass, and we're introduced to a number of characters and their own storylines, so many that I might not be able to list them all here. You have President Whitmore (Bill ""I'm Not Bill Paxton"" Pullman), a former Gulf War fighter pilot whom the opinion polls are turning against for his seemingly ineffectiveness and lack of resolve. You have M.I.T. grad turned cable guy David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) whom is still coping with his divorce and uncovers the aliens' secret plan. You have Air Force pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith), who applies to be an astronaut but is rejected because of his relationship with his girlfriend, a stripper and single mom named Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox). Oh, and then there's Randy Quaid's Russell Casse, a Vietnam War veteran who spends his days in a drunken stupor, supporting his three children as a crop duster and recalling his own alien abduction. All of their destinies somehow intersect throughout the film as the extraterrestrials launch their attack,

The aliens attack on July 2nd, blasting blue-green rays of energy down on major cities around the world, causing tidal waves of fire that kill millions and leave the cities in flaming ruins. The Earth forces mount an aerial counterattack on July 3rd, but are vastly outnumbered and quickly overwhelmed by the swarm of technologically-advanced aliens, whom then take out most Army bases. Frustrations mount as it becomes more and more apparent that the aliens seem unstoppable. The remaining American forces retreat to the modern-day mythical Area 51, where they organize one final strike at the aliens on July 4th.

Many of the characters are stock and cliche, like the science whiz no one wants to listen to but who is always right, or the trigger-happy government suit whose only response to a problem seems to involve firing all available weaponry at the enemy despite the repeated failure of said weaponry. (Emmerich and Devlin are known for falling back on these very cliches in their other movies, as evidenced by their Independence Day follow-up Godzilla), and several of the plot points seem highly contrived and unlikely. A simple computer virus being compatible with advanced alien technology seems ridiculous, so the possibility that said computer virus being capable of taking down technologically-advanced alien force fields is even more ridiculous, and that's saying a lot when you're talking about a movie about an alien invasion. But the special effects are the real stars here (though some shots do look noticibly green-screened if you look closely), and the underdog story of outgunned and outmatched Earth forces taking on a seemingly invincible alien threat is a crowd pleaser. And you can't help but cheer a little bit when poor Russell Casse gets his revenge. This is probably the best film by Emmerich and Devlin to date, something that doesn't look to be changing anytime soon.",1221177600,3,4196,5.084179970972424

Will Smith got ""jiggy with it"" as a hotshot F/A-18 pilot in the movie; Randy Quaid (the older brother of Dennis Quaid) proved to be the comic relief; Bill Pullman's character transformed from a President with the problem of a nation into a reborn veteran; and Jeff Goldblum became more brilliant than ever! The only difference between ""Independence Day"" and ""Top Gun"" is that the 2 adversaries were humans and aliens instead of Americans and Soviet pilots. Independence Day is really just patriotic drivel in means of plot and adventure. But the film comes into its best moments when the action sequences hit the screen.

People say that with movies like this you have to leave your brain at the door, the problem is, they don't tell you just how much you have to leave behind. Well....With this movie, the only way you can accept it, is to bring 10% of your brain. Any logical aspect of your mind will be thoroughly insulted with the whole concept and the lame a** storyline with an unbelievably predictable plot.

In this movie, the director and writers are saying ""Your so stupid, that we can feed you any crap and bull and you'll take it like a fish"". And by looking at the reviews here, it certainly seems to be just that. Here is SOME of my list of amazingly craptastical issues I personally had with the movie. Lest I had accidentally brought 15% of my brain had been a mortal life changing mistake.

(Wife/Tunnel/Fireball) Wife in car sees fireball coming at her, has time to get out of car, run long ways down tunnel, find a door in tunnel, try to open door but locked, kick door down and get in all while the exploding blast took 5 min to get to here, but it didn't end there. When she got in the door she realized her dog was missing. Still fireball blasting in her direction had time to call her dog. Dog responds and starts running in her direction and jumping just in time to miss the fire blasting behind him.

(Wife/Husband/Desert) Husband wandering aimlessly in desert just happens to run into his wife who happens to be caravaning with America finest trailer trash park.

(Amazing Virus compatibility) Mac is a great computer, but it's amazing just how the aliens had the same operating system as we do that we could download a virus to their computer. AMAZING!

(Trailer trash F-14 pilots) All our skilled highly trained F-14 pilots are all dead, but the planes somehow all survived.
""Any of you trailer trash have flight experience?""

(Highly Skilled Alien Pilots out piloted by trailer trash pilots) I have nothing more to say on this one.

I honestly looked forward to this movie and am more than willing to leave my brain at the door, but there are some movies, as such, that is so horribly written and insults your intelligence so bad, that even when leaving your brain behind that you just can't get by how dumb they think you are.

On another note, I'd like to accredit the people who had done the special effects. Where the people who had put months into perfecting the explosions and overall graphics of the movie, the screenwriter had only spent a half day on writing his quality script. It's sad to see so much hard work done, only to be insulted by a half as* job of writing.

Although, the video does show some grain and artifacts occasionally - like during the dark scenes, open sky, or just the desert sand. I only notices these imperfections on a 70-inch(at 1920x1080).

826976,5,6304233639,"First off, I can tell you that I have always loved this movie for what it is and always has been...... a better than average sci-fi movie. It actually has a plot that makes sense, and the writers succefully intermixed the story line of 4 different groups of people until they merge at the end to 'save the world'. The effects are great.... way ahead of its time in 96. And it's got IMHO one of the best written speaches that ever hit the big screen (the president's speach to the pilots). Kudos to the writer who wrote that....it almost brings me to tears no matter how many times I watch it. And Bill Pullman does an AWESOME...let me repeat...AWESOME acting job in this movie (ex: hospital scene where he is 'loosing' his wife -the first lady).

HOWEVER...this review isn't to try and sell you on the movie. LOL! The movie is from 96, and chances are, you already know if you love or hate ID4. My opinion is not going to change that. ON THE OTHER HAND, if you love this movie....if you watched it 10 times over when it first came out.... if you were one of the crazy people who saw it at it's midnight release (*raises hand*)...then you ABSOLUTLEY HAVE to see it on Blu-Ray.

Now I already own numerous upon numerous Blu-Rays and I will be the first one to say that the technology is well worth the price tag of these disks and getting a new player. ALSO... a lot of people don't know that to properly see Blu-Ray in it's highest quality, you not only need the player and the disk...but you better be hooking it all up with HDMI cables or you are going to be loosing quality in the process. Again... it's another expenditure, but if you love your movies and are a big QUALITY FREAK...it's worth double it's price tag. It really does make a BIG difference (and the HDMI cables will even help the quality of non-blu ray's if you use them for your normal dvd player too).

But I digress...  For me, ID4 is no longer even watchable in any other format other than Blu-Ray. When I bought this I had my doubts as to whether or not it would be true 1080p since it was originally recorded in 96 before the technology was even a glimmer in anyone's eye (and remasters aren't always what they are cracked up to be). But trust me... they out did theirselves on this one. But don't take my word for it.... DO THIS: Buy the movie, watch it in blu-ray...and THEN go to the special content menu and watch THE ORIGINAL TEASER TRAILER. It's played in it's original format. You know? The format that we all thought looked out of this world on the big screen back in 96? Well, OMG....the difference is MIND BLOWING. STAGGERING, even! Seeing the original format after watching the blue ray version brings it all into perspective. The detail on the new Blu-Ray version in the space ships...the fire...even the buildings.... all I can say is WOW!

And apparently I'm not the only one who noticed this. I'm in the Chicago area....and I had a heckuva time finding this Blu-Ray in regular stores. Eveyone seems to be trying to get their paws on it (-May 08). Grab it thru Amazon...save yourself a headache. :)",1211500800,8,3084,4.422535211267606

With a 1080 122"" screen, it's painfully evident: you can pause the movie and watch the entire picture bob up and down two or three pixels by scanning forward frame-by-frame. The shot where the shadow crosses the World Trade Center is a big offender, but you can even see it during the closing credits. It's almost as if the projector that was used to do the transfer couldn't hold the picture steady from one frame to the next. I have another 20th Century Fox movie that does this during the opening Fox fanfare (Ice Age), but the movie itself is perfectly fine since each frame there is computer animated.

826981,1,6304233639,"This is a really stupid movie.  It's not original in any way, a bad montage of tired science fiction and action comedy cliches that make the movie both highly predictable and completely unexciting.  The epitome of special effects without sensible plot.  Even the talented actors in here go to waste with foolish lines, impossible physics, over the top action sequences, the movie is just bad in every way possible.  It's interesting how the high minded science fiction with the cheesy special effects in the 1960s (Star Trek envisioned a future where we somehow cured poverty and racism), and the feel-good triumph of good over evil (Star Wars made us all cheer) of the 70's, gave way to the explosions for the short attention span audiences at the close of the 20th Century.  To enjoy any science fiction movie, you have to buy into the fictional science of the movie, it has to seem realistic.  Well that wasn't too hard in Alien, because we can all relate to being scared of something we don't really know or understand.  Here's a typical problem in Independence Day.  You ever rent a car, and find you can't just pull out of the airport parking lot because you can't figure out how the unfamiliar car starts up, gets into gear, where the headlights are, the wipers, the seat controls?  And yet, in this movie, you can apparently hop right into an alien flying vehicle and not just take for a spin, but save the planet.  The only time I saw this horrendous movie, I saw the ""I sure picked the wrong day to give up drinking"" line coming from a mile off, and the fact that the script writers would try to pull this off years AFTER ""Airplane,"" well it really makes it clear that Hollywood doesn't think very highly of the typical American moviegoer.",1209340800,5,1749,4.612903225806452

827093,5,6304233639,"This film about freedom from the destruction and colonization of aliens is more fun than any movie before. Although there's probably no chance that a virus uploaded into an alien mothership would shut down its systems, this movie has plenty of epic explosions and classic science-fiction to make this a grand movie.

While the special effects in this movie nowadays looks a little dated, people have admired this movie for director Emmerlich's arrangement of humongous saucer U.F.Os shooting laser beams out of the center of the bottom. No one could forget that frightening explosion of the White House in the movie. And while I have no idea how they opened communications with the president, this film really sets a positive mood.

It helps to have a great orchestral score by David Arnold, as well as great actors such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Vivica Fox. And boy, Will Smith had fun with this movie. He shows off his bravado literally beating up aliens, firing rockets into spaceships and shouting ""Peace!""

Okay, this is a silly movie. However, because ""Independence Day"" has so much fun being a destroy-the-aliens movie, it has been one of the best science fiction films in the 90s, more fun than ""Armageddon"" or ""Godzilla"".

Roland Emmerich trots out every clich and stereotype imaginable, yet it is impossible to take offense at any of them. It is a ""B"" movie in every sense of the phrase, save for big name stars and a big, big budget. There are good guys and bad guys and evil aliens and loads of twists and turns.

In that respect this is a much better movie than 'War of the Worlds' where Spielberg tries to avoid the genre cliches. Seeing the huge alien spacecraft creating their own mini weather systems was pretty cool even though the science behind such huge spacecraft is unfathomable and imposiible. If we are ever to be attacked from space it will most likely be tiny robots in nano spacecraft nurturing their species'DNA,or the alien equivalent of DNA. Physics,space and time render what you see on this screen quite impossible. To travel thousands of light years in machines like you see in Independence Day would require millions of years assuming you could build such monstrosities in the first place. The original craft was 1/4 the size of our moon. How do you build something like that? Perhaps by hollowing out a huge asteroid or the moon of another planet and then manipulating the orbit of a comet to break the spacecraft free from it's orbit. Or you could use Hollywood's trump card when it comes to science fiction; a mysterious technology that is simply beyond our comprehension. Somehow these aliens have developed warp speed technology and yet Jeff Goldblum can disable their defenses with a simple computer virus so earthlings can win the day and return to bureaucratic corruption as usual. If anything as big as what you saw in this movie was approaching the earth bypassing the moon it would result in the second biggest catayclism in earth's history and sterilize the planet of all life, even bacteria.

827317,5,6304233639,"The existence of life outside of our planet is an idea that has long captured the minds of many people. The thought that maybe their might be some other forms of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is a concept that is both alluring and somewhat frightening at the same time, mostly because no one knows what the aliens (if they exist, which I don't believe they do) would be like. In the movies there are a few instances where aliens are depicted in a benevolent manner; examples would be films like, ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"", ""Men in Black"" (the good aliens), and even the 'Star Trek' series at times. However, the majority of the time when aliens are featured in movies they are malevolent creatures bent on our destruction, such as; ""Men in Black"" (the bad aliens), ""War of the Worlds"", and ""Mars Attacks"". One of the most successful entries into the alien invasion sub-genre of science fiction would be the visual effects blockbuster ""Independence Day"" starring Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum.

""Independence Day"" begins on a day when all seemed to be normal in the world and another run-of-the-mill 4th of July weekend was upon us. However, when giant saucers begin to fill the skies above numerous big cities across the globe, everything quickly shifts from average to extraordinary. As humanity attempts to contact what is believed to be aliens residing in these giant ships, one former scientist turned cable repairman (Jeff Goldblum) discovers that these aliens are anything but peaceful, and as he warns the President of the United States (Bill Pullman), the aliens strike with deadly force. Now, with the attempted annihilation of the human race in full swing, our last hope rests upon humanity's ability to work together in the face of adversity, and on a daring mission led by a cocky pilot (Will Smith).

Here is a movie that beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely lives up to the term 'summer blockbuster'. What makes ""Independence Day"" such a great movie is not the fact that it is one of the best alien invasion movies ever made, of course that helps, but the mass appeal it has to such a wide audience. The film contains something for everyone; there's action, drama, romance, comedy, and of course, what would an alien invasion movie be without the prerequisite element of science fiction. All of those components when mixed together leaves audiences with an out of this world movie experience that they will undoubtedly want to enjoy time and again.

The acting for ""Independence Day"" was completely solid throughout, which was a pleasant surprise given the material of the movie and the fact that some of the actors aren't exactly known for their high-quality skills. Two actors that really surprised me by how good they were here were Bill Pullman as the President and Randy Quaid as a former alien abductee who's a little off in the head. Pullman surprised me because I hadn't really seen him do a whole lot of dramatic work, which was primarily his job in this film. All I'd seen of him were comedies, one was the Mel Brooks spoof ""Spaceballs"" and the other was ""Casper"", neither really tested him as an actor though, so I was surprised with how good he was in the role. And Randy Quaid, well he's done plenty of screwball comedies as wacky characters, so I knew that he could handle that aspect easily enough, but my fear was that he would ruin the movie by taking it too far into the stupid direction. Surprisingly, Randy played things with just the right amount of crazy without going overboard, and he even handled the dramatic aspects of his character, that appear later into the movie, with an earnest sincerity that was refreshing to see. Probably the biggest surprise in the movie was Will Smith's performance, though he was but one part of an ensemble cast, whenever he was on screen he made the movie his own with relative ease. I wasn't convinced that Will could truly handle a somewhat lead actor role for a big blockbuster film, since his previous movie was the highly successful actioner ""Bad Boys"" with Martin Lawrence carrying half the load. But once things got going, Will proved that he definitely had what it took to solidify his place among Hollywood's A-list stars, and his continuing success within the film industry is evidence of that.

Now on to the one thing that all reviews of science fiction movies require, the critique on the special effects work within the film. Top-notch special effects work is a key component to making any good science fiction movie, if you don't get the effects right and just wow the crowd, the audiences will turn on you in an instant. But for the folks that worked on ""Independence Day"" this turned out to not be a concern for them. The effects in this film were so top-of-the-line at the time the film was made, that most hold up very well to this day, a little over 10 years later. There are a couple of scenes that don't look so hot though, one would be the scene in which Vivica A. Fox's dog must jump into the hallway to avoid being burned alive, when the fire passes behind the dog it's a really obvious green-screen effect, of course there was no other way to do the scene, but I've seen better work done in plenty of other movies. Secondly, the scene where the alien attacks the doctors that are examining it within Area 51, the alien's movements look a little too hokey. Too much like stop-motion animation with all the tendrils whipping around, the movements felt choppy, kind of like when you watch some of the old Christmas TV shows that use stop-motion animation, the movements are fluid for the most part, but there's a slight choppiness that makes them feel somewhat awkward. But, other than those two times, I really can't come up with much else that hasn't held up from the special effects department, which is why this movie is still a favorite for many movie fans, and continues to hold its place as one of the best alien invasion movies ever made.

827389,3,6304233639,"In every single one of the 900 million aliens-come-to-earth movies that had come before it the aliens were malevolent, bent on man's destruction, but Independence Day changed all that. Yes, the alien's were once again malevolent, but this time Judd Hirsch was in the movie! Never before had this even been dreamt of, putting Judd Hirsch in a film. It was a brazen move, one almost as stunning as casting Bill Pullman as the president of the United States as opposed to taking the obvious path and casting him as a guy at a Rapid Oil Change who says, ""Ahead. Little more. Little more. Okay, stop."" And never before in screen history had a person named ""Vivica"" done anything let alone attempt to act credibly in a movie role.

Not only that, Independence Day dares to feature one of the most ineffective inspirational speeches since those delivered in a bunker in Berlin in late April 1945.

827390,2,6304233639,"It is amazing that George Pal's War of the Worlds still is one the best alien invasion movies ever. ID has little of the drama, dread or cool war machines that WOTW had. ID is little more than a poorly written (the bad humor that was present in Godzilla is also present here) SFX fest where it ends with little if any afterthought of ""hey what a great ending"" or ""thank goodness they upped the ante in the effects and pacing because that really worked."" Unfortunately it didn't work. The solution of how the aliens were defeated was especially disappointing. The solution in Hollywood nowadays is to ""up the ante"" within the movie itself AND from movie to movie. The results are more and more effects just for the effects sake. Many scenes go on too long (a la Peter Jackson's King Kong) and the story suffers. History now shows us that Devlin and Emmerich were a lousy script writing team. Enough with the excuses of ""what do you expect from a popcorn film?"" A lot of the best Sci fi were also popcorn films too. WOTW. When worlds collide. Day the Earth stood still. Time Machine. Planet of the apes. Soylent green. Forbidden planet. Alien. Star Wars trilogy. (not the lousy ""prequel though""). This movie is a ""bad in a bad way"" popcorn movie. I walked away forgetting most of it right away. A good popcorn film always stays in my memory.

Alien invasions in the form of city-sized spacecraft had everybody very interested in the beginning. Too bad that after about an hour and a half or so in the movie the writers decided to wrap it up before the movie ran too long. I guess the writers figured that since we've already impressed the audience enough with our special effects, let's just tack on a quick and happy ending where our heroes easily fly into the mother ship, blow it up, fly out and then crashland the same ship that killed three aliens back in the fifties by the way. Then walk away smoking cigars without a scratch on them. Okay, everybody's happy.

827604,5,6304233639,"This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.

The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.

Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.

This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.

Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon.

827605,3,6304233639,"1996, a presidential election year with a very much criticized President, Bill Clinton, and a strong conservative movement building up in the wings to impose later on a republican president that would sell a vision  of the world drawn from the apocryphal gospel of some christian born again that is no saint at all. But you have to put this vision on the market, peddle it to innocent customers and prepare the public to the total war it would justify and bring upon Americans, with eventually thousands of dead totally collateral victims. This film is part of this  cultural  strategy to make us believe the US are under attack and has to go to war and pay the sacrificial price of this war and its victory. In other words it was paving the way to the election, by the Supreme Court first and later with a minority of the popular vote, of George W. Bush and his war on terrorism, on Afghanistan and on Iraq. Luckily the infernal mechanism seems to have come to a gripped halt, to a citizen-inspired grasp of reason, in time to avoid two or three more wars on who knows what and whom. The result is a schmaltzy waltz with invading extra-terrestrials. Nothing is orginal. The basic idea comes from Ronald Lafayette Hubbard and his Battle Earth, without the basic idea that human beings are slaves and must not be destroyed because they can be exploited, without the long and fundamental initiative coming from the deepest depth of the human species to build up a counter-offensive and the reconquest of liberty. The Extra-terrestrials are copied from so many other productions that it is nearly an icon of visual and pictorial plagiarism. And the victory is borrowed from H.G. Wells and his War of the Worlds in the form of a virus, this time a computer virus. That's a creative twist, isn't it, in other words spam ? The actors try to do what they can but it is so incredible that they seem to be acting with a tongue, or maybe two or three tongues, in their cheeks. When Hollywood goes to war in the political field, it can be pretty bad and unbearably unethical. Every producer and director is not Charlie Chaplin, not even Jeff Goldblum, thanks God for it, otherwise we would effectively, efficaciously and effectfully be sold any kind of adventurous caper on the international stage. Though in this case this campaign succeeded quite well, even if it seems to have come to an end.

The special effects were unquestionably spectacular. Unfortunately, that was all it had going for it. Right off, I saw that the producers were out to make a quick buck without actually thinking about such basic things as good storytelling, decent acting, character depth, and credible dialogue. They didn't care that their so-called story had plot holes the size of lunar craters. They didn't care that their so-called script was riddled with moronic dialogue and annoying, unfunny jokes that kept repeating. They didn't care about anything, except the special effects, and the profits.

And now, this. A tenth anniversary edition that only serves as a numbing reminder to the thinking moviegoer that the same people who made this one of the most commercially successful movies ever still think it's a great piece of filmmaking. I for one thought, and hoped, that people would soon enough wise up to the fact that ID4 is a huge dud. I actually hoped they would realize that after the novelty of the special effects has worn off, what you're left with is garbage. I really believed that after being exposed to the likes of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, films which combined terrific special effects with good storytelling, they would see ID4 for what it really is: an enormous pile of dung.

Sadly, I was mistaken. Emmerich and Devlin are still making big bucks out of this singularly awful attempt at filmmaking. And what I find particularly disturbing is, the fan base for this movie has apparently not only remained loyal, it actually seems to have increased in number.

Know this, I have nothing against mindless fun. I am fully capable of appreciating a movie that allows me to leave my brain at the door and just sit back and enjoy. But see, mindless and stupid are two different things. Even the Abrahams brothers, who gave us no-brain belly laughs with the likes of Top Secret, Airplane and Naked Gun, should be credited for thinking up all those gags. And mind you, that takes a lot of imagination. Emmerich and Devlin, on the other hand, clearly made no such effort. And therein lies the difference between mindless and stupid. The mindless enjoyment should be on the part of the viewer. The producers still have a responsibility to think through their story. When they fail in that responsibility, what they come up with, more often than not, is stupid filmmaking.

I remember a behind-the-scenes featurette wherein Emmerich, in an interview, said, ""I don't care about critical acclaim. I just want to have fun."" Fine, who doesn't want to have fun at his job? But if his idea of fun is inflicting stupid films like ID4 on the movie going public, well, that's something I simply can't endorse.

Of course, there are strong indications that a lot of people have no problem at all with this type of attitude. To these people, I say go ahead and buy your copy of this tenth anniversary DVD release. Just be aware that you are contributing to the bank account of someone who didn't care about quality filmmaking, and just wanted to have fun. And know that he's succeeding at your expense.",1161561600,15,3397,4.692953020134228

Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious.

As usual, Jeff Goldblum is the scene stealer as a quirky genius, and Will Smith does his usual tough, smart, funny persona bit. Bill Pullman is alright as the President; his wife is played by the lady from ""Dances With Wolves"". Judd Hirsch is fun as Jeff's dad.

Maybe there are too many characters and maybe the film is long, but this isn't a terrible crime. The film isn't BAD.

827702,5,6304233639,"I know many films with stronger plots, better writing, more balance. However, for sheer spectacle and fun, it's hard to top this one. Many stars appear here, and several give top-notch performances. Judd Hirsch gives a great turn as Jeff Goldblum's dad, and Will Smith gives a star-making turn as the air corp pilot who heroically helps save the human race. Jeff Goldblum gives his usual intense performance as the lead scientist who happens upon the code the aliens are using and also helps save the human race. I know this sounds VERY hokey, but it's all part of the special charm of the film. All this is secondary to the special effects here. This film won the Academy Awards for best visual effects and best sound, and believe me, it richly deserved them. The destruction of New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. are as awe-inspiring now as when the film came out in 1996. So many Sci-Fi movies seem to disappoint in one way or another, most of them take themselves way too seriously to be enjoyed. Believe me, this film is a fun ride from start to finish. Never mind the glaring ridiculousness of some of the plot lines, the movie just scoots along happily, and you just need some suspension of disbelief to thoroughly enjoy this. The tranfer to DVD is flawless, the picture is razer-sharp, and the sound is staggering. Several bonus features are here, and all are your basic bonus stuff. Check out the original biplane ending feature, it's so great to see that something so outrageous as an old biplane taking out a huge alien ship was actually considered at all!

827703,4,6304233639,"I wonder if it says anything significant about me that I waited 10 years to see this particular blockbuster.  I mean, I always figured I'd get around to this film at some point, so I'm not a TOTAL cinema snob and distainer of all things commercial. Those clips of the White House getting zapped were pretty attention grabbing back when I first saw the previews back in the day.  Or just seeing those megalith space ships hovering over every major city in the world was pretty darn ominous.  So deep down, I always wanted to check it out.  But I guess I just was never in that much of a rush to.

Now critical analysis is sorta my game, and as the Amazon reviewer notes above, INDEPENDENCE DAY is mostly a pure fun movie--and not one many people are going to subject to intense critical scrutiny.  So why bother to review it all? At this point, it's available in so many different formats that probably all most consumers want to know is which is the right one for them and for their player. They already know whether they want to purchase it or not.  Reviewing the film as film may be virtually pointless when most consumers likely only are looking for a product review at this point.

Well, what can I say? I'm a critical analysis kind of guy, so I really can't tell you about the merits of the Digipak over the double or single disk anniversary versions.  To tell you the truth, I watched the thing on plain ol' VHS--that I picked up on sale, no less.  But I still liked it, even without all the DVD bells and whistles.  And, yes, the visuals were stunning even in this antiquated format.

But just an apercu or two.  Watching any film in which iconic American buildings get zapped from the sky is no longer the innocent escapism it was in 1995.  I even winced at seeing the twin towers standing tall (and unharmed) in some of the early, pre-catastrophe scenes.  We watch such things with more of a jaded eye these days.  Or is it more of a horrified stare?

Escapist fare is usually centered around a big ""What If.""  These days, we pretty much KNOW ""what if.""

Before seeing this movie, I had always wondered how well Bill Pullman (an actor I genuinely like) would pull off being presidential.  Was he a little TOO young? A little too callow? Cleverly enough, the screenwriters have made him a struggling, almost failing Commander In Chief, whose prior life as a hero pilot in the first Gulf War may have gotten him electec but left him ill prepared for hardball politics.  He's presidential in that youthful John F. Kennedy/Bill Clinton kind of way.  Unlike them, however, he's not much of political pro at all.  But also unlike Kennedy, he's still young and able enough to enter into actual battle once again himself--and  (many would opine)unlike Clinton, he has the guts to do so.

And that's something blockbuster films like to play on, isn't it--our almost innate, primitive desire to have our leaders be actual heroes?  Of course, we're just (post-)modern enough to want those heroes a little bit flawed, to say nothing of a bit conflicted.  Pullman is all that and more.  But there is never any doubt that he won't pull off his counter-offensive.  He's got that cute and newly motherless little tyke (the one who later showed up on CHICAGO HOPE) to take care of, so he cannot allow himself to fail.

And neither can the crazy crop-dusting pilot Randy Quaid, whose very family has pretty much written him off as a loco loser.  Somehow Quaid is able to inject some humanity and some wit into his stock loser-who's-gonna-show-'em role.  But still, there are times when you find yourself mouthing his lines along with him and wondering just how he pulled this off with a straight face.

Which you could also say about the rest of the cast as well.  These mostly very good, widely respected actors have their work cut out for them if they want to move their characters at all beyond the level of the stereotype.  Funny thing is, most of them do.  Mary McDonnell suffers and dies admirably.  Margaret Colin is stunning and sassy as a Presidential Aide.  Her performance is good enough that you have to wonder why she never became ""Then Next Big Thing"" after all, and I say this with utter conviction, even though I must admit that at the same time, I still keep mixing her up with Elizabeth Perkins.

And in the face of almost certain annihilation, she decides to put aside her feud with (still devoted) ex-hubby Jeff Goldblum.  Good thing too, since it is Goldblum's character who has figured out the alien invaders weak spot.  Now all he needs is the ear of the president...But how? But how?  Wait a minute, I know...!

Ok, so it's a bit cliched.  But in a tongue in cheek way, you understand.  The beauty of latter-day Sci-fi flicks is that their dazzling special effects are so overwhelming that you really don't want to be bothered with much else.  INDEPENDENCE DAY, like so many other S-F films, wants to come across as 50s flick with killer effects AND enough of a sly self-awareness so as not to appear hopelessly cornball.

It's akin to being part of the base of support for your favorite politician - you're part of the cadre of true believers - and then becoming angry when he or she strays from cherished core principles to troll for votes.

The sad fact is there are never enough purists to sustain any cause, no matter how well-intentioned.  I know - I'm a hard-core baseball fan who hates furry mascots, the ""lets-make-some noise"" exhortations, baseballs that race across the Jumbotron as fans cheer their ""favorite"" and the animated clapping hands prevalent at most major league ballparks. But I also understand that baseball's a business and franchises have no choice but to try these ancillary gimmicks to attract casual fans. Hey, maybe they'll notice the actual contest on the field.

Lest we all forget folks, ID4 is a product of the business of Hollywood. I get the sense that many of the one-star reviews of ID4 are coming from the sci-fi purists who expected the second coming of War of the Worlds.

Wasn't gonna happen. ID4 was an unabashed for-the-masses production. Thin plot? One-dimensional characters? Lots of pyrotechnical special effects? Of freaking course! I'm not a sci-fi fan. I don't particularly care for most of the dreck Hollywood puts out. But I happened to enjoy this flick immensely, and I consider myself someone with an IQ far above plant life.

Why do I love ID4?

One day in July huge alien spacecraft settle over the major cities of the world, without any warning or indication of their plans they just hover over the cities. In an effort to communicate with the alien spacecraft the millitary send helicopters out to them to try and gain some type of positive reaction, but the reaction they got wasn't planned or wanted. They attacked and destroyed the helicopters and then initiated their initial plan, the center of the crafte opened and revealed a weapon that could destroy miles of the city. Within minutes New York, Washington, Moscow, London, Berlin and other major cities where wiped out in a matter of minutes, this sparked the millitary to launch a counter attack whith no effect whatsoever because they have a shield that cannot be penetrated.

That is all i am going to tell you about the movie as i feel i may have ruined the best part of it for you but i must say this that this is an incredible movie and for it's time had some of the best special effects.

As I watched it, I thought of the book, ""Operation Hollywood: How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the Movies.""  ""Independence Day"" served all the interests of our overgrown military establishment - lots of joyful explosions, jingoism and rallying around the warrior president.  There's even a scene of a US suicide bomber, thrusting his jet into the core of the ""mother ship.""

There was a review of this film in the satirical paper, ""The Onion.""  They mentioned how the representation of aliens as invaders who are going to destroy us helps to engender a pattern of thinking that frightened US citizens apply to people in other countries, immigrants, socialists or whoever our military state is targeting for oppression.

If people are interested in learning more about how some of us are being manipulated by these sorts of films, I'd highly recommmend Eugene Jarecki's documentary ""Why We Fight.""  It's an expose of the military industrial mafia that Eisenhower warned us about, and the culture that helps the Pentagon profiteers get away with their crimes.

This quote from ""Patriotism"" by Emma Goldman is dedicated to Will Smith, who in the movie is a pilot who is driving the new jet-fighter, and exclaims, ""I've got to get me one of these"" -

""The powers that have for centuries been engaged in enslaving the masses have made a thorough study of their psychology.  They know that the people at large are like children whose despair, sorrow, and tears can be turned into joy with a little toy.  And the more gorgeously the toy is dressed, the louder the colors, the more it will appeal to the million-headed child.

An army and navy represent the people's toys.  To make them more attractive and acceptable, hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent for the display of these toys.""",1149897600,15,1945,4.966049382716049

Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.

The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.

Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.

This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a terrific alien invasion film and well worth having in one's collection.

Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.",1147824000,3,2592,5.006960556844548

The acting is a bit of a stretch at times (the best performances seem to be given by the supporting actors/actresses instead of the mainstay people, save for Will Smith's comedic role as Captain Hiller).  Vivica A. Fox provides a touching, well-acted and believable role in the movie, as does Mary McDonnell as the First Lady; environmentalist and scientific genius David Levinson is a bumbling and comedic, though unbelievable especially during his ""drunk"" rants and raves about blowing up the earth, when really someone that wasted wouldn't be able to talk that fast or in such detail (interestingly, the actor who plays him is the same as Jurassic Park--and his characters speak under their breaths as well).  Thoroughly entertaining in many ways.  Of course, the aliens have two legs and two eyes, making them more human--which is something they wouldn't be scientifically because they'd be somewhat related to the human race if they were so; they also look quite familiar to last year's War of the Worlds.  Overall, Independence Day is brilliant save for some acting.",1142294400,2,1130,5.0864864864864865
827796,4,6304233639,"There sure is a lot on this DVD...all one disk.  The picture is quite nice.  The branching seems to work well enough, though there might be slight pauses during the extended version.  The only serious defect here is the DVD mastering engineer's use of dynamic compression on the 5.1 mix.  It's as if they were trying to compensate for people not having 5.1 systems and good DVD players or recievers that could fold-down the sound properly for 2 speakers.  During the loudest portions of the film, particularly with a lot of bass, the overall volume has been brought down...you can hear it happening, like an old 1950's pop song with a bad mix engineer.  Again, any compression is only necessary if you are listening to the 5.1 mix in 2 channels and your decoder doesn't bring down the volume overall for you, which it should be able to.  I'm not sure of any unit that doesn't already do this in some form for you automatically.  You don't master DVDs with this ahead of time, so it's puzzling.  Perhaps what the engineer/DVD authoring people actually did was accidentally encode the Dolby Digital Night Time compression schemes on the main soundtrack, rather than simply keeping them as an optional encoding.  The only other way I can think of would be if the engineer was stupid enough to play the entire 5.1 soundtrack after discrete decoding back through a mixer that combined all 6 channels into 2 channels manually for playback and monitoring through a single 2-channel meter and/or 2 speakers. In that case the idiot could have been incorrectly monitoring the levels.  I've got more sound expertise in just one of my butt cheeks than someone like that.  Regardless of how or why it happened, it's kind of distracting at the end and certainly doesn't represent the way the film was originally mixed.  4 stars for this ""Five Star Collection Edition"".",1141862400,4,1854,4.774294670846395

827799,2,6304233639,"It is still amazing to me that this film was the top grossing movie of 1996, followed by ""Twister"", which in many ways was equally cheesy. I remember seeing the ads for this movie before it was released, and even a well-polished advertising campaign could not hide the schlockiness of it all.
The dialogue is completely forgettable, the plot is thin and obvious, and even if you CAN suspend your beliefs and assume that an Apple laptop computer can do all of the stunts that Jeff Goldblum's character's computer can do and that a cropduster suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (Randy Quaid) can learn how to fly late 20th century state-of-the-art military planes basically by instinct, there is one final piece of posturing that is too much to take. NEVER would the President of the United States both endanger himself and allow himself to become a spectacle by putting on a flight suit and piloting a plane in a time of war ... Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about that incident 3 years ago...oops...my bad.
The reason I am even giving this film two stars is for one, the special effects are impressive in a movie that has precious little else going for it. Secondly, and most of all, the only thing that makes this movie remotely watchable is Will Smith. Even with what the writers/directors give him to work with he steals the show. Plus, the ""buddy"" thing he has going with Jeff Goldblum's character when they go to deliver the computer virus to the alien spacecraft comes off well. I'm just glad that Will Smith got to showcase what he is really capable of the following year when he starred in a quality film about alien life on earth, ""Men in Black"".",1140566400,3,1670,4.664406779661017

Look, I'll give you the fact that it's not a deep, meaningfull, piece of art. But if you go into watching it that way, then you've got the problem.

If you saw a preview, the ads make it perfectly clear: this is a movie where aliens come down and blow suff up. PERIOD. duh.

Yes, we don't really care about the characters (espescially the kid in the baseball cap - I think that character is a movie pre-requisite, even though it's so annoying). Yes, the story is simple and in many cases predictable. But you don't go on a roller coaster ride because the seats are comfortable.

Stuff blows up. Stuff blows up a lot. And it is good. It's pure mindless fun. If that's not ""mature"" enough for you, then you would bewrong to think that it would be. You don't turn on a rock and roll radio station hoping to hear Beethoven.

By the way, to all of those who are reading this: All the other reviews on this movie are POSITIVE. Except for that one guy. Just for the fun of it, go see all his other reviews. Guess what?!? He hates EVERYTHING! 7 out of 7 movies! He even goes so far as to give ID4 a bad review two different times!

So much for the plot. In this version the acting was good, and the dialogue was perfectly OK. The story moves along at a great pace, and there's always something interesting to gawp at. This is exactly what I like to see: heroes saving the world, baddies coming to bad ends, leaders leading from the front, family values and true love conquering. Just the stuff to fill in some time with a bit of escapist fantasy, humour and entertainment. Fortunately I'm not gifted with the genius of all those one-star reviewers, with their giant intellects, who are able to explain all the technical faults so excellently, but sometimes I think it's a bit funy that thy knt seme to spel to wel.

Really, it's that awesome. the play between Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith is fantastic.

The story is about aliens invading our sordid planet but the director has a deeper meaning in store for us in this classic film. For example, when the President of the United States was giving encouragement to the people of the world, he said that he demands independence not just for America but for the whole world from the aliens. His speech of world unity in the face of catastrophic crisis is an inspiration for world peace. Moreover, the use of nuclear weapons in this film is a reminder to the viewers that weapons of mass destruction can be useful if used correctly.

827960,4,6304233639,"This movie has a really cool base plot, over-the-top special effects, and an ending that is nearly plausible.  The pacing of the movie is so fast that you tend to forget that the movie is full of far too convenient coincidences and more lucky breaks than any one race should deserve.  Regardless of how many times I have seen this movie, I am always up for one more.

Our main characters see some strange things at the beginning of the movie.  It turns out that the strange things are aliens entering our atmosphere.  The generation that grew up with ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" decides that the best thing to do is to say hello to the new neighbors.  However, it appears that our alien visitors are more akin to the aliens of ""Starship Troopers"" than to E.T.  We eventually learn that the aliens have two things in mind; our extermination and the rape of our planet.

However, because we have lots of macho, manly, men running about, we are not going to wait for the aliens to exterminate us.  We have President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman, who has had a number of experiences with a variety of creatures, such as reptiles in ""Lake Placid,"" scary dead people in ""The Grudge,"" ghosts in ""Casper,"" and Sandra Bullock in ""While You Were Sleeping""), David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, who managed to hold dinosaurs at bay with biting wit in two ""Jurassic Park"" movies), Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith, who has more macho in his little finger than most guys in their whole body), General William Grey (Robert Loggia, who just exudes macho, in a grandfatherly sort of way) and Russell Casse (Randy Quaid, who has lots of macho, it's just hard to find), along with a cast of hundreds of other macho people (including some women) who gamely sacrifice themselves to beat off the alien attack.

Things initially look pretty hopeless.  The aliens have a game play and they are sticking to it.  Everything looks like they are on a tight schedule, and the aliens smack our high tech equipment as though they were gnats, and ignore nuclear weapons as though they were nothing more than a brief puff of wind.  Ah, but we know something the aliens do not.  Well, a couple of somethings.  First, we have all the macho, manly, men.  Second, we have a spacecraft that crashed in Roswell, and it is kept in the place that does not really exist, Area 51.

How can we combine the two things that we have and end up with an alien exterminating play?  Well, it helps to have wise Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch, who has little alien experience), David's father.  An amazingly simple statement by Julius suddenly triggers a brilliant thought in David, and bingo, a solution to the alien problem is created.  Of course, we need aspiring astronaut Captain Steve Hiller to fly the spacecraft to the alien mother ship so that David's computer (with homage to HAL-9000 on it) can talk to the alien computer.  They also are carrying a nuclear missile to attempt to wreak a little havoc on the alien mother ship.

The rest of the movie is aerial battles and a huge self-sacrifice that makes you want to salute an American flag somewhere.

This movie is full of corn and coincidence, and yet it is darn fun to watch.  The action is so fast that you rarely have a chance to think too much about the numerous coincidences, or that your emotions are being deliberately manipulated.  Unless you spend too much time analyzing movies, especially science fiction movies, and you like a lot of action, then I think you would absolutely love this movie.",1124582400,,3533,4.641479099678457

All that would be OK though, if the script and characters were up to scratch. But trust me - they ain't. Will Smith is in ""cocky but loveable"" mode, chomping on a cigar and talking about ""whoopin' E.T's ass"", he has a doting wife and annoying (or, ahem, ""adorable"" child), the President's wife can talk and relate to a stripper, the guy from Taxi is in it as the Stereotypical Jew, and Jeff Goldblum is, admittedly, the only good thing in the entire movie.

The effects are awesome, of course, but then you would expect that when a film costs more than the third world debt. Famous buildings get blown up, spaceships whizz around and everything is shiny and nice.. if only they'd bothered to put a story in there.

Again, it's really annoying. With this money the producers could really have given us something to remember (a ""Star Wars for our generation"", as some dimwit before me put it) but it's just another in a depressingly long line of empty headed, expensive popcorn flicks for stupid people to whoop and cheer along to.

828055,3,6304233639,"A former co-worker of mine used to say that this film was really just a B-Movie that had a big budget, and I have to agree.  I was psyched to see this film when it came out, having shades of ""War Of The Worlds"" and ""V"", but was ultimately disappointed in what turned out to be an unintelligent film with a ""you gotta be kidding me"" ending.  A big departure from their previous film, ""Stargate"", which was in many ways a polar opposite.  ""Independence Day"" is entertaining if not taken seriously.

The DVD also includes commentary by producers/writers Dean Devlin and Rohland Emmerich.  Each of them says ""This is my favorite scene"" about 3 times each, and Emmerich sounds like he learned English in the valley (""Like, y'know, this is, like, my favorite scene, y'know?"").

Must've been the cool, textured metallic skin of the alien ships (stolen from Star Wars' Death Star), the way things shake and rumble when the aliens arrive (stolen from ""Close Encounters""), Will Smith's patter (stolen from ""Fresh Prince""), Jeff Goldblum's sincere scientific nerdiness (stolen from ""Jurassic Park""), the disc-shaped alien attack ships (Battlestar Galactica), Judd Hirsch playing a loquacious Jewish man (Taxi), the mass exodus from the doomed cities (The Day After), the migration of survivors through the ruins of Los Angeles (Earthquake), big beams of light incinerating entire metropolises (Star Wars again!), debating nuclear options in the bunker (Dr. Strangelove), the alien using nerd scientist as hand puppet (Star Trek), and the temporary unification of all the people of the globe through the force of a common threat (War of the Worlds).  While when viewed from a distance, and appreciated for all its logical and scientific screw-ups, this movie clearly sucks, you can see why folks were take in by it.  It's not a movie by itself, it is simply a montage of many other, better movies masquerading as an original effort.

And yes, the world would not be the same in the morning after several dozen fifteen-mile-wide behemoths crashed into the ruins of most of the globe's major cities (not to mention the ""rain of fire"" that would follow the detonation of the orbiting alien mother ship...oh my!).",1118707200,10,1595,5.099616858237548
828058,1,6304233639,"In case I forget to mention it, Independence Day flat out stinks.

Very briefly, I agree with most of the other one-star reviews.  First, this picture is horribly mis-cast--Bill Pullman as the President and Robert Loggia as a general?  Ptooie!  Next, all trace of story logic is kicked aside so we can quickly move on to another ""Awwwww"", ""Yee-Haw"", or ""Gobbless Amurrica"" moment.  And last, the plot devices are so thin that I started having nightmare flashbacks of Sean Connery in Outland.

Still, Will Smith is an amusing guy and the special effects are as good as advertised.  What's the harm in cranking suspension of disbelief up a few more notches and enjoying the ride?  This attitude carried me up to the point that the valiant US Air Force bravely attacked the scum-sucking aliens in defense of a grateful world.  These bold pilots closed with a target the size of downtown Los Angeles and let 'er have it with a devastating salvo of Sidewinders.  As if a bunch of air-to-air missiles with 20 pound warheads are going to affect a saucer covering the lower half of California!  To say nothing of why get close at all?  Are they afraid of missing?  I fled the room at that point and could only finish the movie after the brick-to-the-forehead feeling went away.

People got paid money to write this dreck.  I recommend you don't give them any more.  If you feel you must experience the special effects or Mr. Smith's comedy firsthand, borrow your friend's copy.

Finally, I'm amazed that there are five or six different ""special"" DVD editions of Independence Day.  No matter how many times you rub it, you can't polish a cow pie.",1118102400,14,1637,4.704225352112676
828089,1,6304233639,"This is on my top 10 list ""All time worst movies""!  I can't understand how anyone can compare this movie to Star Wars.  Star Wars took some imagination.  George Lucas paid attention to details and he cared about his story.  You get none of that with Independence Day.  There is no attention to detail, logic, facts or reality in this film.  I could go on all day with the problems with this film.  The casting, acting, story are horrible.  What was the point of making a ""Sci-Fi"" movie ultra-politically correct?  Does anybody actually care that tokens for each ""minority"" group are represented in this film?  After the first 20 minutes only morbid curiosity kept me watching.  When I saw the surface of the moon vibrating from the approaching alien ship, I knew I was in trouble.  I guess the genius writers couldn't figure out that vibrations don't travel through space.  I guess I shouldn't be too hard on them, since they were probably still in elementary school when they wrote the script for it.  I kept wondering how much worse can it get.  If I had seen this in a theatre, I would have walked out.",1117756800,8,1105,4.566326530612245
828090,4,6304233639,"Huge alien ships descend on Earth, wiping out whole cities with their death-rays while themselves remaining safe behind their impenetrable energy screens. Those left by the death-rays are annihilated by swarms of enemy fighters that fly in huge, insect-like clouds (and are similarly shielded). Not even nukes can stop these guys. But one man has the brainstorm that may save the world.

It's easy to say that this was THE popcorn flick to catch in 1996, but nearly 10 years later, it's easy to step back and see what else went right besides millions in CGI.  ID4 combined the right mix of FX, can-do ingenuity and patriotism missing from follow-ups like ""Godzilla"".  Bill Pullman plays the President, an ex-fighter jock who starts off telling his aides that ""we have no cause to fear"" until the alien baddies demolish the White House in the now classic money-shot. Jeff Golblume plays one of his stock characters - the brilliant-but-awkward type who despite his lowly tech job working for a cable TV service run by Harvey Fierstein, comes up with the idea that may defeat the aliens. Will Smith is the Marine who flies his F-18 like something out of Star Wars, and comes up with some of the flick's best lines and most of its sheer gusto.

As a blockbuster, this flick grossed cash while naturally inflaming critics. In some ways, this alien-invasion epic deserves both the praise and criticism, though for reasons different than fans and panners would suggest. The special effects sometimes show their limits (especially at the end when the alien ships fly across the screen like mosquitoes, as opposed to those in ""Star Wars"" which alternate between being a dot in a huge on a frame of film in a complex background to filling the screen), and much of the visual impact is lost unless you've got the wide-screen version. The dialog won't win anybody any Oscars (the best lines sound conspicuously ad-libbed; the rest sounds no better than ""you're father was a hero, you should be proud of him""), and some promising characters and ideas just get tossed out completely (especially those dealing with ""Area-51"" and the chief geeky scientist played by Trek alum Brent Spiner) before the script has any fun with them.

WHY THIS MOVIE ROCKS (ANYWAY): The flick's imperfect FX are still spectacular and remain so nearly a (Star Wars-filled) decade later. Clearly the design team was inspired by SW, but had more than a creative nod than the hordes responsible for perpetrating the past 2 decades worth of SW rip-offs on us (""StarCrash"" or ""Message From Space"" come to mind). Some of the characters rise above the sort of shallow cardboard you'd expect, or otherwise allow remnants of previous roles they've played to give more charm to their roles here (like Robert Loggia as a general, or Harry Connick Jr. in an inspired bit of miscasting as Will Smith's wing man). But above all, ID4 excels because its makers took an idea that was never really original but also took the bold step of handling it all - militant, locust like aliens, epic-scale dogfights, huge motherships, impenetrable force-fields - as if it had never been done before, and giving the whole premise an unmatched sense of depth.",1116806400,3,3193,4.862132352941177

It is similar to Star Wars, and other science fiction movies, but that is the point, to many people think that it sucks for certain reasons because they are to stupid to listen to the lines in the movies.

Like one of the many explotions, the one in that tunnel with the dog managing to save its' own life in the nick of time, that was not so good.

Actually the biggest problem is the man supposed to be the star of ""Independence day"". Yes, Will Smith! I wonder if he maybe thinks he is a ""bit"" cooler than the rest of the planet thinks. He has fans of course, but I remember being embarrased by him overacting already in the ""Fresh Prince""-series. He is painful to watch in ""I.d"". I know of course he didn't write the script nor his own lines, but Will Smith becomes a parody on himself in the movie. And I don't know how many times during the movie I wanted to tell him to ""Shut up!"". I mean hitting the alien on its' way out of the spaceship; ""Welcome to earth! Now that's what I'd call a close encounter!"" There are plenty of those.

Other than that, and the ""America save us all!""-patriotism, well as mentioned -""Independence day"" has its' moments and highlights, and some remembarable scenes. What I'm trying to say is that some of the story here also functions, it's not all effects.

They say that the biggest Sci-fi-movie ever is the classic ""War of the Worlds"", not that I agree on that, but that movie probably was what ""Independence day"" was when it was released in the theatres back in the mid-90's.

828095,4,6304233639,"Winner of the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Independence Day is a true summer blockbuster in the traditional sense. Released on July 4, 1996, the film enjoyed a long run in theaters across America, and the larger than life plot line made this sci-fi thriller one of the biggest commercial draws of its time. From an entertainment standpoint, it deserved every bit of attention. Because Independence Day is an epic that a wide-ranging number of movie-goers will find fun and enjoyable...

When Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) looks forward to his acceptance by NASA in the astronaut training program, he experiences a rude awakening when strange movements of clouds hover into the area and reveal themselves to be alien spaceships. As the world's leading governments and militaries go on high alert, the world holds its breath waiting to see what will happen next. Against the backdrop of this worldwide event, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) notices a peculiar pattern in the spaceship deployment. Along with his father Julius (Judd Hirsch), he urgently travels from New York to Washington DC in order to warn the president of impending danger (his ex-wife is an aide to the president, thus providing him with a means of access).

Despite their past differences, David manages to convince President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) that the true intent of the alien spacecraft is invasion, and no olive branch of peace will appease them. When David's assertion proves to be right, most of the world's major cities are utterly destroyed by a super laser emanating from the undersides of the monstrous, city-sized alien structures. As all-out war ensues, earthlings quickly discover that the alien craft are protected by an impenetrable force field, thus rendering their desperate attacks useless.

As refugees crowd into the rural areas of America, Capt. Hiller is brought to Area 51 and introduced to the president. The once mysterious location is revealed to house an alien spacecraft identical to the ones which now threaten earth, and plans are put in place to make this craft operational once again. But, still, the problem remains of how to go about defeating the alien invaders... The answer comes to David when his father tells him not to catch cold.

With a new plan, David and Hiller fly the alien spacecraft right into the bowels of enemy territory. Captured inside the mothership, Smith and Goldblum act out one of the more memorable scenes of the movie when they enjoy a pair of cigars while held in captivity. Goldblum's character, who earlier derided cigars as deathtraps, can now appreciate some of the finer aspects of a life he now realizes could end at any time. In fact, it makes me want to go light up a fine Arturo Fuente right now!

Overall, I didn't expect to like this film, and I did. Surprisingly similar in its plot devices to the George Lucas hit The Return Of The Jedi, Independence Day is nevertheless a fun and enjoyable film. The storyline of human versus alien tends to evoke a subconscious adrenaline in even the most casual of viewers, leading to an emotionally involved audience anxious to discover the outcome of this modern day war of the worlds. Although by no means is this to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, it ranks as a definite must-see as a result of its overall entertainment value. Take a chance and go see it if you haven't done so already...

Many scenes and subplots are entirely unforgettable and the acting for many of the parts is sub-par, however this film works because it appeals to most people on a gut level.  The idea of people coming together to overcome overwhelming odds, all through their ability to look for and find unique solutions to a problem, resonates with most people and leads you to forget some of the more hoakey and stupid aspects of this movie.

Jeff Goldblum does a good job as the ""cable repair guy"" who saves the day through learning the aliens code and finding a way to use their code against them.  Bill Pullman as the President is good in some scenes and not so good in others.  Certainly not an oscar worthy performance.

Like it seems all of Emmerich's movies, the best scenes are those showing cataclysmic destruction of cars, buildings, statues, etc.  My guess is that Emmerich has stepped on far more sandcastles than he has built.

Emmerich did a great job when he did Stargate and Universal Soldier but then made this and I have seen it 11 times already but each time I hate parts of it yet I always go back, go figure.

A massive ship(550 KM) appears in Earth's atmosphere and the US is scrambling to figure out what's going on. The ship then splits into about 15 smaller crafts but smaller's the wrong word since each one is 15 miles long anyway. Cities slowly start to evacuate until one scientist figures out(was that signal in morse code? Pretty smart aliens) that they're gonna fire on Earth. And boy do they. The cities literally get engulfed in building-high flames and destroys the city.

The president has to land at Area 51 and finds out that the aliens(in probably the dumbest plot contrivance ever) are going to destroy every city on Earth and move on. The aforementioned scientist figures out a way to beat them and to destroy the ships, they just have to go to Big Mama's ship first.

In terms of character development and a simple plot, there isn't one. Simple meaning that everything makes sense without you going ""but how did?"". Like when that scientist is able to hook up to the mothership with his laptop. My floppy disc can't even read Mac programs but his can link up with alien computers? BAH. What you do get though instead is big flashing and boomy stuff. Explosions, explosions and effects galore. It's certainly cool to watch but it just hurts your brain.

""Welcome to Earth"" indeed!

It's an entertaining flick that is enjoyable time and again.  I'm a big Jeff Goldblum fan, and he does his off-kilter bumbling genius schtick again, and really well.  Will Smith is a winning personality, though you wonder how his ego would fare in the modern military...And a positive nod to Randy Quaid, you turns a potentially hokey role into a pretty good performance.

828150,2,6304233639,"I liked ""Independence Day""...when it was first came out under the name ""War of the Worlds"". Leave it to Roland Emmerich to take classic theme and massacre it with a bunch of flashy special effects. ""Independence Day"" is one of those films where you go oooh and aaaahhhh over the special effects but when you leave the theater, you leave completely unsatisfied and feel totally ripped off. That is how I feel when I first saw this film in the theater and on dvd. This film totally apes ""War of the World"" and ""V"", two of my favorite movies that involves aliens trying to take over earth.

There really is no plot to this film. Aliens comes to earth and they immediately go on a huge rampage, destroying everything in its path so they can take over the planet. It is up to Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, Margaret Collins, Robert Loggia, and Randy Quaid to stop the aliens. What I really didn't like about this film is the overindulgence in special effects. Not that this story didn't need any special effects but what I saw here was special effects abuse. It was overindulgent and way too flashy (the last few shots in the film was obviously still shots). I guess Roland Emmerich had to come up with something to keep the moviegoer's attention because the storyline (or should I say lack thereof?) certainly wasn't going to do that. The acting was subpar. I could not buy into the idea of Bill Pullman as the commander in chief. Will Smith may be charming in this film but his character is pretty much no more different than most of his film/tv roles which says a lot about his acting range (which is about as deep as a dixie cup). The speech that Bill Pullman gives to his troops is indeed derivative and just over the top. Nothing wrong with patriotism but that the writing for that speech was atrocious. Gotta love the last shots of the film where the Egyptian pyramids and the Australian opera house manages to stay intact despite the destruction around them. Talk about realistic.

This whole theme of alien invasion has been played out and ""Independence Day"" definitely helped make this popular scifi theme tiresome. Granted that when ""War of the Worlds"" was made, the filmmakers weren't given a whole lot to work with but there was a spark there that ""Independence Day"" just doesn't have. ""V"" was campy and fun which ""Independence Day"" doesn't even come close. All ""Independence Day"" is nothing more than all flash and no substance.",1109548800,5,2447,4.635944700460829

On the other hand, those reviewers who think this movie is ""awesome"" or ""the greatest movie ever made!"" really aren't saying much for themselves.  While the special effects are excellent, much about this movie is mediocre or even banal.  I won't bother going into a lengthy discussion on the movie itself--it's been reviewed to death and just about everyone's seen it and has their own opinion.  But I briefly want to touch the whole plausibility of the subject of this movie.  Every time that I've watched it, I invariably wonder what a real alien invasion would be like, and whether we would really be able to do anything about it.  As much as I've thought about it, I've never come to any conclusion other than we're doomed if it should occur.  Clealry, humanity's triumph as depicted in this film and others of the genre is just not going to happen.  I know that's not a revelation, but I wonder sometimes about how much people take these sorts of movies to heart.  All those movies, for instance, where the hero foils terrorist plots etc. and saves the (usually just in the nick of time), in my opinion at least, seem to have conditioned people to believe that what happened on 9/11 wasn't possible.  And so in some ways I tend to think that movies like Independence Day give us a false sense of humanity's ability to deal with such a threat.  But I guess the chances of an alien invasion happening any time soon are quite slim, so I guess its not all that big an issue.

828152,5,6304233639,"This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.

The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.

Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.

This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.

Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon.

When I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought this was going to be one of those great movies that really caused the viewer to pause and consider the possibility that alien invasion really could occur--and on a global scale, with huge space ships that could hover over entire cities.  The scenes of the huge shadows looming over entire cities were ominous and terrifying.  The idea that an alien species could simply pick and choose a planet that had resources that they needed--and take them by exterminating the entire population (much like mankind has done in the past) actually lends even more credibility to the concept of what I thought this movie was going to be about.

Unfortunately, this movie ended up being a comedy for the most part.  With the ridiculous sub-plots, silly one-liners, and cute-and-cuddly ending, I walked away from this movie with great disappointment.  This movie could have been an epic masterpiece, but the producers decided to go with the ""Hollywood formula"" and ended up creating a typical, predictable yawnfest.",1104278400,3,1083,4.988888888888889

Independence Day definitely kept with the tradition of top-notch summer Hollywood blockbusters, which started in 1993 with Jurassic Park, and ended in 1997 with Men in Black. I've noticed a string of one-star reviews from people here and a the IMDB. Apparently, there are some very angry, overly-PC people out there who like to bash Independence Day because they claim it promotes Unites States nationalism. To each his own. They can think what they want, but I'm sure they never had the rush of seeing a presumed-dead alien popping out of its spaceship while Will Smith's character shouts ""Welcome to earth"" and proceeds to knock the bugger out cold. For those out there who like to politicize Independence Day: Notice how he did *not* say ""Welcome to the U.S.""

After having seen Independence Day once in the theater and countless other times on video, I will admit that this is one of those movies where you obviously have to suspend belief, but it is one hell of a ride if you just let the movie immerse you.

Will Smith was playing his fresh prince character as usual (but this time dressed as a pilot); Bill Pullman was completely miscast as an uncharismatic, boring, leader; Robert Loggia laughable as the general (he makes you think we'd be better of with a head of the brownies instead); to name a few.

828220,4,6304233639,"It's too bad the creators/producers did not use the same type of grand scale destruction when they made GODZILLA two years later.  INDEPENDENCE DAY was a culmination of sci-fi movies up to that point taking parts of 1950's classic sci-fi, most notably WAR OF THE WORLDS. Then taking some inspiration from the 1980's television mini-series ""V"". Finally, using the modern special effects of STAR WARS. Also, the film used bits of modern conspiracy theories about alien abductions, close encounters, and government UFO cover-ups  (i.e. AREA 51 and ROSWELL) and aspects of modern technology (i.e. computer viruses and cable/satellite television).  The film is therefore, a little derivative in the overall plot of an alien threat from outer space bent on destroying the human race and taking over the Earth. However, what makes the movie work and memorable was the human element of the film with engaging and well-defined characters to care about.  From Will Smith's ""Capt Steve Hiller"", Jeff Goldbloom's ""David Levinson"", Bill Pullman's believable  ""U.S. President Whitmore"", Judd Hirsch's curmudgeon father to Goldboom's David ""Julius Levinson"" and finally Randy Quaid's crop dusting pilot ""Russell Casse"".  The list goes on as even the small support roles were handled great on the human level.  Lastly, the military and political characters were handled intelligently.  This is a crowd pleaser film and had the film been released after 9/11, it probably would have been more successful because of its sense of pride and patriotism themes.  There are some lapses in terms of resolving the alien threat in a mere few days.  When in terms of real human conflict, it takes months and years to resolve anything.  But, hey! This is Hollywood and it's only a movie...but what a movie!  Great production values, great casting and decent script makes I.D.4 one of the few modern sci-fi movies that would be considered a modern classic on an epic scale.

This movie does not take itself at all seriously and understands that its sole purpose is to entertain. The action sequences are superior and effectively convey a massive sense of scale. It has the same intellectual value that cotton candy has nutritional. It will satisfy a craving and is fun every so often, but will not fill you up or sustain your health. If your diet consists of nothing else, your teeth will fall out and you will die. Films such as these will have the same effect on your imagination. Have fun, enjoy them when you can, but do not subsist on them.

OK enough with the griping, if you've never seen this movie then heres the concept. Aliens come and take over all the major cities in the world and start to destroy them. It's up to the United States (yeah of course it focuses on us in the U.S. no offense to anyone in another country) to mount a rescue with people from different cultures to figure a way to stop the invasion.

Yes, the plot is implausible - e.g. no one would believe that a virus could be generated and uploaded from a laptop computer to the aliens' mothership so easily.  And yes, the characters could be developed a lot more.  If one focuses on these two aspects, then this flick is a failure.  But these shortcomings are more than made up for by the comical side of the movie.  A lot of humor is embedded in not only what the characters say but also in the acting, the photography, and the plot.  Some of the visual effects are pretty cool as well, but the humor is what makes me watch this movie over and over again.

828289,5,6304233639,"This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.

The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.

Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.

This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.

Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.

The quality of this two disc DVD is superlative with crystal clear visuals and great sound quality. The letterbox format offers both the theatrical release version and the special edition version from which to choose. The special edition version offers an extra nine minutes of restored footage. The second disc offers a myriad of features, including an interesting thirty minute documentary on the making of the film.

things flying around, stuff blowing up, flag waving, etc etc
and yes it is escapist and all good fun
all good stuff (although a little over done, as others have
pointed out, with the flag waving bits -- but then given the
title, i think people must have known that before going in)
but it does fall foul of the usual fault of having one
supremely bad plot element. i'm referring to the odd idea that
the alien shields can be taken down by injecting a computer
virus (oh so easily). in this case, it is a cop out -- a cheap
way for the screenwriter to get from point A to point C without
bothering with B
a wise man once said never let the facts get in the way of a
good story. and a writer once said he never checks the technical
aspects of a screenplay (for the same reason)
the problem with this (and many films suffer a similar problem)
is that it pulls me right out of the film. the suspension of
disbelief of an action rah-rah film can take you to a certain
point, but it is easy to step over that line. the virus did it
for me in this one
any film that uses classic dialogue such as  ""this is real

of problem",1089936000,,1238,4.094650205761317
828293,1,6304233639,"Normally I don't use reviews as a forum for sniping at other reviewers, but it would appear that Thomas B. Clark came as close as he could to calling me un-American because I didn't care for the jingoism that saturates this film.  Well by golly, I guess it is now clear that this film must be a litmus test of the patriotism of all Americans.  If you hate it, you must be some sort of com-symp pinko --- it's off to the Russkies with ya.
Incidentally --- I would have refrained from socio-political commentary if only you had also --- I would gently remind you that the Indian Air Force is reported to have done very well against the USAF in exercises conducted in February this year, so maybe the USA really isn't the only one who can get the job done.  I'd be willing to bet that the Israeli Air Force, to name just one, might be able to hold its own as well.  Of course, maybe I am just whining again.
The argument also seems to be that critics (in addition to being part of the 5th Column) cannot endure a film that engages in make-believe.  You can't be serious.  Just because a film requires the viewer to suspend belief doesn't necessarily mean it has to suck.  I enjoyed ""Hellboy,"" ""Men in Black,"" and ""Alien,"" for example.  None of these is remotely believable, but they are well-crafted films with decent performances from their respective casts.  Likewise, films packed with explosions & mayhem can also have compelling storylines & characters --- ""Master & Commander,"" for example.  I guess I am guilty of expecting the makers of a movie --- even one that is ""just fun,"" should give us more for our money than some paint-by-numbers hack job.
And that is exactly what this movie is, Thomas B. Clark.  Contrary to what you claim, I hardly did any nit-picking on all the plot holes in the story, although other reviewers have gone over this movie's silly inconsistencies with a fine-toothed comb.  My main complaint was that with the disengaged acting, the cardboard-cutout characters, and the painfully predictable storyline, all the movie really could rely on is lots of special effects & nifty explosions, which really on works on the big screen.  The commercial success of this turkey has only encouraged Hollywood to even greater FX excess, to the point that filmmakers seem to think that if they throw enough CGI and special effects at you, they are not responsible for also giving you a decently-crafted movie with a plot & characters and stuff like that.
Hey, it's your money.  I spent $1.50 at the budget theatre watching this and I guess I broke even.  I pity the people who blew 7 or 8 dollars for this, but again, spend it on what you want.

It's up to a ragtag band of can-do-Americans, ranging from the President (Bill Pullman) to a druncken crop-duster pilot (Randy Quaid), to rally our spirits and save our bacon.
An engaging of second-tier-talent--Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, Judd Hirsch et al.-- is on hand, and the lack of superstars works to the picture's advantage. Whereas Arnold, Tom or Sly would have to make it out alive, these journey men could bite the dust at any moment, and a surprising number of them do. For once, as a result, something's really at stake in all those white-knuckle suspense scenes.
If the writer/directer team of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich made some engagingly loopy moves in STARGATE, here they play genre convections dead straight and make them work. Thumbnail sketches of the dozen or so principal character are executed quickly and efficiently, so you actually care a little when they're imperled.

I saw this in 1996 and I've spent hours regretting the fact that I had contributed money to its cause. When I was at a friend's house not long ago, I saw a DVD copy of it on his shelf, so I made a joke about it being a ""steaming piece of pony loaf."" He took offense to it, and actually tried to convince me it was a good movie.

Interesting the graphics of the larger buildings being the target of the aliens.  Sadly the implosion of the Library Tower and the Empire State Building looked all too much like that of the WTC.
I can still remember the look on the man's face while looking up in disbelief as the alien ship over Manhattan begins to ignite the Empire State Building.

Cast:  Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, Harvey Fierstein.
Running Time:  145 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for some violence, a particularly scary alien scene, and brief language.
A quintessential example of the ""summer blockbuster"", ""Independence Day"" is a full-filled science-fiction epic with a likable cast, astonishing special effects, and a unique style of direction from Roland Emmerich.  It is a film that emphasizes the American dream, patriotism, and perhaps is a stab at communism, in which the war against the all-mighty alien terror is actually symbolizing the decades of struggle that the United States dealt with against socialist countries such as Nazi Germany and the U.S.S.R.
Will Smith is excellent as a rogue fighter pilot who finds himself preparing for an unusual enemy--a species of extra-terrestrials that first hovered over the planet Earth, but then struck mightily with beams of destructive fire that ripped apart all of the world's major cities.  Bill Pullman gives an adequate role as the gung ho president who must trust his heart and not let political issues determine the fate of the world as he knows it.  Jeff Goldblum play his usual scientist role, but is wittier than usual and is a grand compliment to the Fresh Prince.  The three main stars engage in an all-out battle against the aliens, eventually coming face to face with the mothership and its inhabitants.
""ID4"" is certainly not an emotional film, but more of a visual effects spectacle that show-boats the arriving technology at the time.  Director Roland Emmerich basically states ""screw your cool-looking dinosaurs Spielberg, check this out!"" and lets loose with a barrage of intense explosions and catastrophe, making the first half of the film similar to that of an old 1970's national disaster flick.  The second half of ""Independence Day"" is truly enjoyable as the audience gets to konw the characters better and they are intertwined in a battle for mankind.  Cheesy, outlandish, and sometimes down-right stupid; however, it not taken too seroiusly, ""ID4"" is a rock-em, sock-em adventure that will delight the whole family.

828362,1,6304233639,"This is DVD marketing at its ugliest, worst case scenario. What is this, the third version now?
I have the two disc ultimate, or whatever it was, from last year and it's good enough despite a nasty chapter change sequence after the gang escapes the White House. The thing just freezes outright and sloppily cuts into the next chapter. There isn't any scratches on the disc, so I'm assuming that's one of the errors that this release will supposedly correct.
The movie itself gets 4 stars from me because it's shameless, B sci fi with a grade A budget. It's not meant to be logical, it's straight up fun.
Special mention has to go to an incredible score by David Arnold. This was his follow up punch to his amazing Stargate score, and he has never come close again to the heights of ID4 and Stargate music compositions. I consider him a two hit wonder, and the soundtrack to this movie sorely needs to be redone with the other 50 percent of the score restored to the CD.
Anyways, pardon that digression. If you don't own this movie already, and you like sci-fi, go ahead and get this version and don't look back. If nothing else, it's a lot more entertaining than the Star Wars prequels and it will show off your DVD player and television's capabilities.

I found Independence Day to be a fun, visually exciting experience. A number of existing reviews picked apart the story line and made a big thing of the plot holes. SO WHAT? This was not a serious scientific presentation, but a chance to suspend belief and immerse one's self in a visual soup of big bang effects. Of course there were plot holes but did you actually think that a laptop would lay waste to an alien invasion? Windows can't even talk to MAC! How would a human written virus infect an alien system? To those who took such offense at the technical side and the plot issues.... lighten up!! By the way, almost every negative review was riddled with incorrect spelling and grammar.

This was not supposed to be a great cinematic masterpiece. It was not supposed to be a moving epic or a heartrending drama - it set out to be an ""aliens attack earth and we kill them"" fast paced action-heavy plot-lite popcorn flick, and that's EXACTLY what it is.
It's mindless, it's inconsequential, it's FUN. Don't go in expecting anything more than two hours of disposable multi-million dollar special-effects-laden blockbuster trash, and you won't be disappointed.

828369,3,6304233639,"""Independence Day"" could have been a great film.  It's got the huge explosions that draw in big summer crowds, it's loaded with fodder for popcorn popping, but after that...
Honestly, this isn't a terrible movie.  It will hold your attention for the entire duration of the film.  The visuals, especially the opening sequence showing you just how tiny the moon and our little neck of the universe can be, are fantastic.  The special effects are top-notch and the acting is over-the-top, loud-mouthed and fun.  The aliens are believeable enough and I liked the touch of Roswell thrown in to give the story a little substance.
However, things went downhill from there.  Now if you've read my review of Emmerich's ""Godzilla,"" you already know that I liked that movie.  But the reasons I liked it are the same reasons that I'm not overly fond of ""Independence Day.""  Like the large lizard flick, the story has no originality to it whatsoever.  It's a blatant rip-off of all those old Sunday matinee sci-fi movies.  At least ""Godzilla"" had the decency to impregnate the title character.  Tons of buildings are destroyed in both films, but ""Godzilla"" more or less just toppled things over trying to hide from the baddies.  Only Madison Square Garden received any extra special attention.  In ""ID4,"" buildings were destroyed to show people just how nifty the special effects were.  The two biggest disappointments in ""ID4"" had to be the virus implanting ending(just too unbelieveable) and Will Smith.  Normally I like Mr. Smith, but he's just too annoying in this movie.  I found myself hoping that one of the aliens would have whacked him just to shut him up.
In closing, I have to say that this is a fun movie to watch if you like explosions, but for some reason, this movie doesn't click with me like ""Godzilla"" did.  I know they are different films, but they were created on the same larger-than-life scale.  ""ID4"" takes itself too seriously.  It's nothing more than a glorified cheesy sci-fi movie that's fun to watch, but just not fun enough.  For a better time, ""Starship Troopers"" has explosions galore, including some cool bug guts.  If that's not your speed, check out ""Armageddon.""  It has that whole ""end of the world"" thing going for it.  Both of these movies don't take themselves too serously, and they are a lot more enjoyable to watch.  If that still doesn't fit your bill, break out the old Atari and play ""Space Invaders.""  Now that's entertainment.",1082332800,,2460,4.827751196172249
828370,5,6304233639,"When this movie was first released, my husband and I were a bit wary; we had seen too many disappointing Sci Fi movies (Starship Troopers, anyone?) to get our hopes up.  However, when we saw the White House get blown up in the previews, we allowed ourselves to be optimistic, and we both left work early to see the movie on opening day.  Sure enough, only a few minutes into the film, we were hooked:  the fantastic opening sequence shows Earth's moon, and suddenly, the supposedly-forever footprints left by our astronauts are blown away as an enormous spacecraft flies overhead.  In a fashion similar to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, people world-wide slowly become aware of this amazing development, but unlike in that earlier movie, these visitors are NOT friendly.
Although the plot may feel familiar, the development of the storyline is thrilling, and it is enhanced by an excellent cast.  Both Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are ideally suited to their roles, playing bravado (Smith) and quirkiness (Goldblum) to perfection.  Bill Pullman is surprisingly believable as the President, and the fine Robert Loggia is a natural general.  Supporting characters Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, Brent Spiner, and Harvey Fierstein are all a bit over-the-top, yet they are completely appropriate for the mood of the film--wasn't Darth Vader over-the-top too?  And also like in Star Wars, this movie does have its cheese-y moments, but again, the goofiness fits right in.  A final comparison to Star Wars is the way I felt just after seeing the film for the first time, which is to say, amazed, exhilarated, and eager to view it again (which I did just two days later).  Independence Day has stood the test of time for me:  it's one of only a handful of movies that I own, and I never tire of repeated viewings.

828431,5,6304233639,"Independence Day is a summer blockbuster film. Your not suppose to care about the plot, your so suppose to sit back and enjoy something that could never really happen.
In Independence Day are fears have come true. Alien spacecrafts have come to earth and are hostile. After a failed attack by our own military all hope looks to be gone. The aliens are slowly destroying all of our big cities and it continues to look bleak. It's all up to a crack team of misfits that include our president(Bill Pullman), Fighter Pilot Capt. Steve Hiller(Will Smith), a cable man David Levinson(Jeff Goldblum), and a even the dumb hick Russel Casse(Randy Quaid) to save the day and the world.
This is such a fun film to watch and is for many reasons. You have to love the special effects in the film. The alien weapons are cool and a lot of the explosions are on a big scale. It's not easy to flatten L.A, New York, and Washington. The movie won the Oscar for best special effects and rightfully so.
The movie has a lot of memorable performances that make it worth buying.
You have to love Will Smith in the film. His one liners and overall toughness really help make the film. They also helped make his carear and he wouldn't be where he's at today without this film.
The movie is stolen however with the performance of Jeff Goldblum. His character David is the main character in the movie and nobody could have played him like Jeff Goldblum. His one liners are great and you love to like his character.
This is another hit movie for Roland Emmerich. This guy has taken the Steven Spielberg mold for summer blockbuster hits and has made quite a carear for himself. If your a fan of Roland you have to pick up Independence Day.
The music is great in Independence Day. David Arnold has written a fantastic score. It has a great patriotic feel to it. The music is well worth the price of the movie. Fans of the movie should look at the soundtrack as well.
Independence Day is a great film. It grossed over 306 million at the Box Office in the U.S. alone and thats a testament statement. You don't make that much money on a bad film.

828432,2,6304233639,"This supercharged War of the Worlds ripoff is worth seeing just for the special effects. It's the only reason to watch it. The acting is cartoonish at best, the plot twists and turns are absolutely ludicrous, the science is so way off it's comical.  But, the really spooky thing about this 1996 movie, is the Empire State building being blown up, and people running through the streets away from the explosion. It presages (unintentionally of course) 9-11 and the Twin Towers.
Watch that scene, and remember the news videos about the Twin Towers. It's unsettling, that a piece of directorial drek like Independence Day, can bring about strong emotional reactions, not because of its inept screenplay, but because it accidentally showed us a vision of a terrible future incident that would Really take place five years in the future.",1081641600,,832,4.985611510791367

Science fiction is supposed to be somewat feasible, or at least give some explanation of why things are happening.  This movie drops stuff on us like a virus downloading into an alien system and destroying their computers (War of the Worlds?).

Who on earth thinks those lines and who are they directing them to?  If you value two hours of your time, don't waste them on this movie.",1081382400,7,794,4.360544217687075
828434,4,6304233639,"I know this movie has gotten mixed reviews, but it is worth watching.  I've seen it many times, & every time it's on cable, I always find myself watching it again.  I do agree with the editorial review about how everything just magically happens in the characters' favor, but *shrug* don't many movies work like that anyway?  The thing that attracted me to it was just the story... the ""what if"" notion of aliens taking over the planet.  That alone may push some away who don't feel open-minded enough to the possibility...& whether it is or not, it's just a movie.  I myself don't think it's too far-fetched... but, well, I'd have to see it for myself.  So with that in mind, it sort of falls into the fantasy category...with a mix of sci-fi, adventure, & comedy, so with all these genres mixed in, it's fun to watch.
As far as the characters, if you liked Will Smith in Men in Black, you'll certainly like him here.  Randy Quaid's character is similar to the one he played in American Pie.... & actually, at times it feels like it IS the same character.  You'll get a good laugh either way.  Jeff Goldblum is pleasing as the genius cable guy who happens to crack the code that no one else noticed... yah, I know.  Goldblum's character's Jewish dad, played by Judd Hirsch, is likable with his memorable wisecracks.
Overall, it's not the best movie in the world, but it is entertaining and has many good moments... so there must be some reason cable keeps playing it over & over.  And of course, some of the special effects are really cool.  I didn't see it in the theater, but I'm sure they were even more impressive.  There are some frustrating & aggravating moments (like the virus idea) that many have already pointed out in here, but different things seem to annoy different people, so I'll let you figure it out.  It is also safe enough for a family, esp. if kids are alien fanatics.  If you like movies like this, I'd also suggest Twister, but if you found either of these aggravating, you'd probably find Godzilla even more so.",1080086400,,2035,4.521857923497268

Armageddon is one of my favourite movies, and I can see a lot of similarities between that & Independence Day.
I don't know why I've only decided to watch this movie nearly eight years after its original release. I will admit to reading the book based on the movie. That could have put me off seeing the movie, as it was mind-numbingly boring. But when I watched the movie, I found myself recognising characters and knowing what was going to happen to them, and recognising the lines too. So obviously the book had some impact on me, despite sending me to sleep most nights.
I was shocked to read that this was the biggest box office success of 1996 - you'd think something like that would tempt me to go and see it at the cinema! I saw Titanic twice at the cinema, and watched the video about a zillion more times. Independence Day grossed about $746m around the world, and a mere $306m alone in the USA.
There are some spectacular effects in this, including seeing The White House getting blown up, LA/New York etc being reduced to rubble (very Terminator-esque) and some very cute aliens appear in a lab (are they available to buy?)
Some great actors appear in this film - Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum being his usual eccentric self, Randy Quaid, Adam Baldwin and . . . Harry Connick Jnr?! There has to be some mistake there. Will Smith was great in this, although there was a big sigh of disappointment when he got out of the bed wearing boxers. Damn.
This must have been great to see at the cinema. The sound is fantastic watching it on DVD with a great sound system. I was fearing for the neighbours next door, as my chair was shuddering beneath me, and took a few minutes before the vibrations stopped! Of course, with a great sound system, whether in the cinema or at home, there were nearly a few accidents. I literally jumped out my skin a couple of times, and to persuade my heart to go back to its usual place in my body, rather than in my throat!

828483,5,6304233639,"Independence Day is the quintessential summer blockbuster movie.  I really cannot understand why the movie is rated three stars or less by so many reviewers.  Not only do I love this movie, I love it just as much every time I watch it.  It never fails to take full emotional control of me, bringing tears of sadness and later happiness to my eyes as well as giving me goose pimples in its most patriotic and triumphant of moments.  We see into the hearts and souls of an impressive number of very realistic characters, and I for one feel myself as one with all of the brave survivors of the initial alien onslaught, watching, hoping, and praying that America and the world can come together and defeat yet another seemingly unbeatable enemy.  I sometimes enjoy pulling for the bad guys in films, but the aliens that arrive suddenly on earth with a plan of exterminating every human being on the planet are pure evil, guaranteeing that the feelings of one and all movie viewers will rest completely with the forces of good.
The storyline is familiar by now.  Aliens arrive in huge black ships, coming to a stop over the major cities of the world, refusing any attempt to communicate with the people of earth.  David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), a cable company employee and M.I.T. graduate who lost his first wife partly to his own lack of ambition, figures out the secret code the alien ships are using to communicate with one another around the globe.  Even with his ex-wife working as the President's assistant, it is all he can do to warn the leader of the free world that the aliens are counting down to attack and ""the clock is ticking.""  Millions of people are wiped off the face of the earth by the force of the alien offensive, and the military all but falls apart as it tries and fails to inflict any damage on the enemy.  In the end, the survival of humanity itself comes down to the brave acts of America's real heroes - good old regular, every day, anonymous Americans.  The quintessential representative of these heroes is Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), Vietnam veteran turned inebriated crop duster whom no one took seriously when he claimed to have been abducted by aliens a decade earlier.  President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) also stands head and shoulders among the crowd of heroes, as does Capt. Steven Hiller (Will Smith) and Levinson himself.
Independence Day is blessed with both amazing special effects and a wonderful cast.  I'm no big fan of Jeff Goldblum or Bill Pullman, but they are both superb in this film.  Will Smith is both inspiring and hilarious as Capt. Hiller; the fit he throws after bagging himself a downed spaceship early on looks and sounds like the kind of thing I would say and do (up to a point).  His interplay with Levinson toward the end of the film offers some truly high caliber comedy, just the thing needed to try and hold one's blood pressure down as the final battle for earth itself is being waged.  Brent Spiner from Star Trek: TNG makes a memorable appearance, and familiar faces such as Robert Loggia and Judd Hirsch add much to the film in roles that are comparatively small for such major players in the business.  The special effects are simply tremendous, boasting some especially well-done, powerful shots.  The sight of the White House being destroyed in the blink of an eye by alien firepower is now a staple of pop culture, and it is just one of a huge number of similarly impressive explosions to be seen here.  The manner in which the film opens is quite eerily effective, and the director obviously went to great and rewarding pains to try and show just how huge these ships are compared to earth's structures and inhabitants.  What I was most impressed with were the scenes depicting infernos rushing and roiling down the streets toward trapped, innocent, doomed men, women, and children; we watch as cars come hurtling toward our viewpoint, and I will never forget the image of a huge fire engine being blown right at me as if it were a dandelion seed in the wind.
This really is the most exhilarating movie I own.  President Whitmore's speech to all the brave men and women around him, including a large number of volunteer heroes who have never even thought about flying an F-16 loaded to the hilt with missiles before, truly gives me chills of patriotism every time I hear it; his is a statement that sums up what it means to be both an American and a citizen of the world.  I just cannot say enough good things about Independence Day; in my opinion, it is one of the most impressive, soul-stirring films I have ever seen.",1058400000,3,4589,4.6325524044389645
828484,1,6304233639,"1995s Independence Day or ID4 was a groundbreaking film. However, This film wasn't innovative in a positive way. Director Roland Emmerich was the first filmmaker to make a movie that completely pulls the wool over the audiences eyes and then cheats them out of over $300 million dollars in ticket sales without providing them with a well written, well acted or even entertaining film. Unfortunately this formula was so successful that every almost film in Hollywood is now produced this way.
The first trick to making the viewer believe they are watching a good film is loading the film with special effects, especially CGI. The viewer is so busy looking at all the computer-generated distractions that they forget that the film has no plot or interesting characters. ID4 or as I like to call it ID$, diverts your attention from the flimsy aliens invade earth story with one dumb stunt after the other. Think about a few of the stunts made with CGI and none of them make any sense. For Example: The Presidents plane takes off the runway during the destruction of Washington D.C., just barely escaping the fire that incinerated the city. In a real firestorm, the presidents plane would be annihilated because the fire would get into the jet engine turbines and cause the plane to explode. Another example is the city of Los Angeles being destroyed. People survive an annihilator ray with no adverse effects after being caught in an explosion except for some torn clothes. And when these city sized motherships are finally are destroyed they don't incinerate the fighter pilots who attacked them in the blast, or rain down trillions of tons of lethal debris on the people below.  In addition, wouldnt the heat generated from such a massive explosion cause even more death and destruction?  Contrast this to Star Wars where Luke, Han and Wedge had to get FAR away from the Death Star to avoid getting caught in the explosions, shockwaves and debris fields caused by a planet sized space station exploding. And they were in OUTER SPACE. But the viewer is so busy drooling over the CGI explosions to think about such details.
The second trick to making the viewer believe they are watching a good film is to play to the audiences emotions so they don't notice how stupid the plot is. ID$ uses good old-fashioned patriotism to trick audiences into rooting for the good guys. According to this film about an invasion of EARTH only AMERICA can save the world from these evil aliens. Supposedly the rest of the worlds military doesnt exist or is too incompetent to help in this crisis. We get tons of visuals showing American forces, fighting aliens, American flags, patriotic music, and a big rousing presidential speech. In the end Will Smith And Jeff Goldblum even get to shake the Presidents hand on a job well done. All of these things distract you from the biggest story errors of all: ONE laptop computer interfaces with an advanced alien computer system flawlessly with no wireless interface. And in 1995 when this film was made laptops barely had HALF the processor speed and memory of a desktop. If this is the case wouldnt everyone who had a desktop at the time know about the invasion and planned to escape? Also, with this computer having HALF the speed of a desktop how COULD it download a virus in to a technologically advanced mothership so quickly?  Wouldnt the aliens advanced computers have detected and DELETED the virus?  Also, if the aliens were TELPATHIC couldn't they have read the peoples minds and figured out what they were going to do? I guess the viewers who helped buy $300 million worth of movie tickets were too busy waving flags and baking apple pies to actually WATCH the film.
The third trick used to making the viewer believe they are going to get a good film is Advertise, Advertise, and Advertise. ID$ blitzed moviegoers viewers with those stunning visuals of explosions, and patriotism for several months before the release. Because of the hype most viewers thought since the CGI effects were good the film must be good. WRONG. This film is horrible. Dont get taken in by its visual prettiness or plays on your emotions. When you start to really think about this film you will hate yourself for letting it dupe you out of your hard-earned money.
Because of the $300+ million ID$ made, Hollywood no longer believes in giving its viewers anything like plot, character development or even a story in its films.  They now know they can get away with making bad movies because in the end they will pull a profit. ID$ started the disturbing trend of filmmaking where CGI and special effects are a used as a crutch by lame producers and directors to make a bad film bankable. Nowadays when a film is lacking in some area, the studios now just toss a few CGI effects or stunts in to distract viewers from the horrible story. Making quality films no longer matters since CGI was invented. Insert some effects and youll make $100-200 million guaranteed. If you're looking for an original story with an involving plot and interesting characters forget it. Because of the success of this dreadful film, Movies are now a Franchise. When producers want to make even more money, they take the same lame movie with the same bad actors and load it up with visual effects and then put a 2 in front of the title. Another $100-200 Million guaranteed. The audience will be too distracted to notice theyve been conned into watching a bad movie. Thanks Roland Emmerich. Thanks for destroying the creativity of the American cinema. You and Jerry Bruckhiemer are the geniuses that have ruined movies as entertainment for everyone with your high action, high noise, low plot low logic McMovies.",1057708800,7,5698,4.792472024415056

828539,5,6304233639,"Independence Day Offers Fireworks and Thrills
 One of the best science fiction films made in recent years, Roland Emmerich's Independence Day highlights a clever script, an A-list cast (which includes Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, and Robert Loggia, just to name a few of the actors) and eye-popping special effects.
This film is essentially a 1950s ""flying saucers attack Earth"" movie - indeed, it is almost a remake of George Pal's War of the Worlds, which some of us baby boomers may recall seeing either as a ""Creature Features"" offering on independent television stations in the 1970s or as a Late Show feature when networks like ABC and CBS carried feature films in those pre-""Nightline,"" pre-David Letterman days....uh, nights. The plot is essentially the same as most ""alien invasion"" movies of those Red-scare 1950s: flying saucers appear literally out of the blue, we try to make contact, they invade, we resist.  Chaos ensues, there are big battles with the Bug Eyed Monsters (BEMs), cities are destroyed, and the war goes the BEMs' way until some scientist or brave military hero comes up with either a wonder weapon or last-minute desperation tactic and saves the day.  (And often in these movies the male lead ended up smooching with the female lead....)
And it is exactly this back-to-the-future ""retro"" feel that is the heart of Independence Day's appeal.  It takes all these clichs and makes them work in such a way that audiences familiar with ""invaders from space"" can recognize the tongue-in-cheek tone of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's screenplay and smile, and there are lots of visual and dialogue tips of the hats to films such as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other science fiction series.  Still, the strongest influence is War of the Worlds, not only thematically but structurally as well.
For instance, in both the original 1890s novel and the modernized George Pal version of War of the Worlds, a trio of emissaries waving a white flag approach the Martians' landing cylinder, only to be vaporized by the invaders' heat ray.  In Independence Day there is a similar scene, when a trio of especially fitted helicopters attempts to communicate with the aliens' ship over Washington.  The aliens respond to this Close Encounters-style light show with a violent show of force.
In another echo of Pal's 1950s movie, President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) reluctantly orders a B-2 Spirit to attack one of the alien vessels with nuclear weapons.  Not only does the attack fail miserably as in War of the Worlds, but the B-2A itself is based on the Northrop ""flying wing"" which appeared in the older film (making use of stock film of test flight footage, since the flying wing was never in U.S. Air Force service).
Even the ending is derived from H.G. Wells' novel, though the twist that Devlin and Emmerich used was not only clever but very 1990s.  Instead of being infected by Earth germs as the Martians were in War of the Worlds, in this film the creepy BEMs are done in by....a computer virus created by David Levinson (Goldblum).  (And if you have not seen the sequence when Levinson and Marine pilot Steven Hiller [Smith] plant the virus aboard the alien ship, keep your eyes open for a reference to another classic science fiction film!)
Independence Day comes in two versions of the DVD: a barebones one-disc edition which has both the theatrical and Special Editions of the movie, commentary by Emmerich and Devlin, commentary by the visual effects supervisors, plus the usual language and subtitles options.  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment also released a pricier 2-disc Five Star Collection edition which has this disc plus another extra features disc.  I have the one-disc edition, and though I miss the theatrical trailers and other goodies, I am satisfied with the DVD I own.",1052179200,13,3869,4.9629057187017
828540,4,6304233639,"In scanning the reviews for this product it appears many of the reviewers took the film more seriously than director Roland Emmerich, his cast, and crew.  INDEPENDENCE DAY isn't meant to be believed--only enjoyed.  It's pure escapism, a vehicle to take us away (if only temporarily) from the trials and tribulations of our busy lives.  This is a science fiction Disneyland, complete with laughs, thrills, drama, intrigue, and heartpounding action.
If memory serves me correctly, this was Will Smith's first major role on the big screen.  Not only is he very funny, he projects a commanding presence that subsequently launched his cinematic career.  Jeff Goldblum is wonderful as nervous computer guru David Levinson, and his chemistry and timing with Smith is fun to watch.  Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore stays stoic and reserved, even when crawling into a fighter jet himself to lead one last attack against the evil aliens.  But Judd Hirsch and Randy Quaid steal the show:  Hirsch as Goldblum's eccentric, over-supportive father; Quaid as a grisly alcoholic cropduster, a former alien ""captive"" who is given the best line and scene in the entire film.
Sure, some of this movie is annoying (Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore giggling the line, ""Liar,"" over and over), but when it comes to a white-knuckled sci-fi ride about humanity taking on an alien culture threatening our very existence, INDEPENDENCE DAY delivers.  And, if you don't take it too seriously, you might even have a smile on your face.  So pull up a chair, relax. . .escape.

Space men invade, we fight them, we lose for a while, but then we take them down in the truest, pluckiest American (ok, Earthly) fashion.  And Will Smith was so great to watch on film.  That swagger as he lights that cigar.  That cocksureness as he drags the alien bad guy through the desert.  Yeah, aliens, you've been roaming the galaxy knocking off planet after planet, but you ain't never seen anything like us.  We may be down, but we ain't out.  Whammo!  Now gimme a cigar.  This movie is not about reality.  This movie is pure escape, and well done.  This movie is about the MYTH that is us, and that's why it works.  We love to see our greatest qualities blown up large on film, and one thing we are as Americans (ok, earthlings) is that we don't give up, not even to alien invaders who have better weapons. Will and Jeff were great in this, but the best scene was the suicide/kamikazi drunkard pilot who takes out the mother ship after telling his rag-tag, mixed race children that he loves them.  That one pulls at your heart strings and SHOWS you what it means to be a hero and a human and a recalcitrant mutt (American) at the same time.  I love this movie, simplistic as it is.

828543,1,6304233639,"""ID4: Independence Day"" is an example of what's truly wrong with not just American moviemaking, but America today.
The now deceased former longshoreman and popular philosopher Eric Hoffer once said, ""The nature of the American is that he is a hustler.""
After seeing ""ID4: Independence Day"", Hoffer's idea becomes larger than life.  Someone obviously wanted to make a quick buck for their stockholders, and they didn't care how. What was produced in ""ID4: Independence Day"" is the cinematic equivalent of junk food.
If there's any doubt about that, just try watching this film twice.  It's as if the producers of this film were saying ""No one ever went broke underestimating the tastes of the American public, so just give us your money.  Up with us and (screw) you!""
The ridiculous storyline notwithstanding, what makes this film more than annoying is an arrogant display of religious ethnicity: Two of the main characters are portrayed as saintlike beings as a result of their affiliation with a certain faith.  This genre of movie is supposed to mindless camp.  Instead, ""ID4: Independence Day"" turns out to be a stab at politically correct mindless camp.
Of course, the film was promoted mercilessly.  The vast amount of money that went into the production and promotion of this abortion would have been better served elsewhere...  and I do mean anywhere else.
In contrast, the films of the late sixties and seventies were experimental, creative and interesting.  Movies like ""Little Big Man"", ""The French Connection"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Rocky"" were all large budget studio films that managed to make a buck, yet still have some integrity.  Today, integrity doesn't count.
You don't either.  Just hand over your money.",1048032000,4,1724,5.125

This movie was made back in the day when such things were only imaginary.",1047600000,,307,3.9193548387096775
828545,2,6304233639,"Independence Day is indeed a great thrill ride, offering at-the-time incredible special effects as aliens invade the Earth bent, as usual, on conquest and destruction.  The movie offers a number of great battle scenes between the heroes and the seemingly-unstoppable aliens with a War of the Worlds-inspired twist toward the end, but beyond those thrills the movie simply falls flat.
None of the characters are either acted particularly well or particularly interesting in and of themselves, and many seem inserted simply as a plot device rather than forwarding the overall story.  The aliens receive no characterization whatsoever and do not shine as bad guys, for all they are there for is to attack and destroy with no real explanation of their motivations.
For the nit-pickers out there, the movie is chock full of groaners, from using a Mac laptop to ""interface"" with alien computer and upload a virus (hah hah, a computer virus rather than a cold virus to kill the aliens) to Area 51 silliness and beyond.
Perhaps the worst aspect of the film is that it inspired the summer blockbuster craze of bad effects-laden films from Godzilla to Armageddon to Wild Wild West by giving producers the idea that a film doesn't need a good story or acting so long as it has lots of effects and one-liners.
I cannot deny having enjoyed the film in theaters and do own a copy, but it is not something I put in when wanting to watch memorable film.  If you haven't seen it or are looking for a shallow, quick thrill, it's worth a watching, but I won't recommend it otherwise.",1047513600,3,1564,4.763837638376383

The special effects are great even by todays standards, much better than the soulless 98% computer generated ""Star Wars: Episode 2."" I'll breifly outline the plot: Sometime in the near future, a massive spacecraft arrives at Earth. It breaks into several dozen other craft, each being 15 miles in diameter. They hover over all the major citys, and soon cause their destruction. And therefore, a band of American heros form, so on and so on. Excellent.

828620,2,6304233639,"Seven years ago, I remember seeing Independence Day in theaters.  Did it bowl over then?  Kinda.  I remember thinking it was an extremely entertaining time at the movies, but bear in mind, I was all of 11 at the time.  Having seen this movie three times since (yes, I bought it on video the first day it came out, watched it and still liked it, watched it again a year or so after that), I can say clearly the charms have worn off.  Independence is most certainly not a good movie, and while it might make for so-so escapism, there's nothing about it that truly bowls me over.  As a matter of fact, ID4 can't even take the claim for best alien invasion flick of 1996.  Hell, it was the third best of that year (behind Star Trek: First Contact and The Arrival), which is a pretty dubious honor considering alien invasion movies aren't exactly delivered in spades.
I'll dispense with a plot summary, seeing how it is you've (a) probably already seen the movie (b) or have heard about it) or (c) would never watch it on the basis of your complete hatred for anything related to science fiction and/or Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (the last one is perfectly understandable).  All you need to know is that aliens want to take over the Earth and it's up to a raggedy group of humans to fight back.
Independence Day has a lot of things going for it: a great premise, energetic action sequences, first-rate special effects, a number of good laughs, and the occasional bit of awe-inspiring visuals.  You might be thinking, isn't that all you need for a successful summer action blockbuster?  Typically, yes, but ID4 has quite a few problems, some even involving the positive aspects I mentioned above, or lack thereof.
The story is the first thing everyone will jump on, and I'll get on the bandwagon with this one; it's true, ID4's script is pretty bad.  Now, the whole virus element in the climax doesn't particularly bother me, considering how it was earlier specifically stated that Earth's satellites were connected to the ships.  What does bother me is why the ships would actually allow such a lengthy countdown, enough time for a lot of people to escape the blast radius.  Most bothersome plot-wise, is that once the shields are down, the aliens are almost pathetically easy to take down.  When the ships are destroyed, they actually crash slant-wise, thus avoiding a huge crash on the target below them.  Only a fool would actually believe this doesn't somehow defy the laws of physics.  Ugh, and don't even get me started on Randy Quaid's character, his deus ex machina role, and his final lines of dialogue.
At this point, I'm a little tired of discussing plot, so we'll get to the action, which ID4 has a surprisingly sparse amount of.  If I recall, we get three in all, the first portraying the destruction of the U.S.'s three major cities, the unsuccessful aerial battle, and finally, the successful aerial battle.  That's really not a lot of action, and considering they're all airborne, the redundancy sets in very quickly.  The film does deliver some thrills, but inconsistently in a movie that runs for nearly two-and-a-half hours.
At this point, it feels a little pointless to even write a review on the movie.  Anyone over the age of twelve who wanted to see the movie has probably already seen it.  The critical backlash toward it is unsurprising, that's the case for every Devlin/Emmerich collaboration.  These guys would follow-up with the even worse, Godzilla, which took redundancy to an all-time high, with its incessant rain and never-ending conclusion.

828622,5,6304233639,"I've always loved alien invasion stories, and Independence Day is the best I've ever seen!  From the first scene to the last, this alien invasion story is a veritable feast for the senses, with flying saucers, ""kewl"" explosions, and aliens that make even the classic movies' aliens look like pussycats by comparison.
What makes Independence Day so wonderful for me is the fact that there is also a genuine story to it that gives it dimension and depth.  It tells the tale of President Thomas Whitmore (the always charming Bill Pullman), a man who is suddenly forced to confront something he'd always thought was a figment of science fiction writers' imaginations--an alien invasion force that could possibly wipe out the entire human race.  He finds himself forced to enlist the aid of David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), his former nemesis and the estranged husband of his White House aide, Constance Spano (Margaret Colin), and David's father, Julius (Judd Hirsch).  As the survivors drift toward Groom Lake and the mysterious Area 51, Whitmore meets up with Capt. Steven Hiller (Will Smith), a young Marine who lost his best friend Jimmy (Harry Connick Jr.) in the initial attack, and Hiller's girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) and her son; Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a Vietnam vet and alien abductee; and Brackish Okun (Star Trek: The Next Generation's Brent Spiner), the crackpot head scientist of Area 51.  He is also reunited with his wife and First Lady Marilyn Whitmore (Mary McDonnell) in one of the most moving scenes I've ever witnessed in a film.
One of the things I liked most about this DVD was the fact that it allowed me to choose between both the theatrical release and the director's cut, which has some scenes cut from the theatrical release.  There is also a second DVD that is chock-full of extras, including a Russell Casse scene that was ultimately left out of even the director's cut, but which was pretty cool nonetheless.

828625,3,6304233639,"Devlin & Emmerich have chosen to revive the popcorn movie. Every film they've made is essentially another attempt at capturing an audience's attention and wowing them. ID4 serves that purpose quite well. Essentially a rip off of H. G. Wells War of the Worlds (right down to the ""virus"" that destorys the aliens although in this case it's a computer virus), it's not great or even good cinema just plain old fashioned fun.
Defying the laws of physics (and good plotting) the aliens have come to turn the Earth into a wasteland. They are essentially like Locusts--they use a planet's resources and move on. It's never pointed out that we  have already done a good job of the same thing. Bull Pullman gives a nicely textured (and believable) performance as the President of the United States. If the world is ever destroyed by aliens, I'd vote for him to save the day. Jeff Goldman turns his usual nervous tics and gestures into another scientist character.
Stock characters aside, ID4 works because of the sheer epic scale. It's not a science fiction movie. It uses all the props mind you, but, really, it's a disaster movie. The visuals are pretty good eye candy and the commentary on how they were achieved is also quite good.
The extras are little more than fluff pieces that were prepared as part of Fox's advertising campaign. Why the alternate version wasn't put on the main disc as an option is beyond me. Yes, it's unbelievable but it's fun in a B movie sort of way. In fact, that about sums up ID4; it's a fun B movie made on an A budget. Just leave your brain in cruise control.

828627,2,6304233639,"Ah...1996. It seems as if it were only yesterday. But it's a world away from the cynical, fearful, paranoid, and oppressive times we live in now. ID4 would be rightfully laughed out of cinemas in the present day.

America, pulsating infectious positive vibes with its booming economy, popular President running for re-election, a summer crammed with iconic, action-packed adventures such as The Rock, Mission: Impossible, and Eraser, all while riding high the wave of the Atlanta Olympics, naturally turned ID4 into the biggest hit of the decade. I must admit, I too was suckered into it.

Why do I say suckered? I recall being amazed by the teaser trailer before a screening of Broken Arrow on April 13th, a full 4 months before the release (we had to wait until August 9th in the UK). It promised a dark, scary, and serious film about interstellar war. Then, as we got closer, a new trailer synced to the theme of Crimson Tide came out, mesmerizing audiences with then revolutionary visual effects.

When the film was finally released the dark, scary, and serious film that we were promised across the entire ad campaign quickly descended into camp, corny, stupid nonsense. It's easy to make a terrible film and entertain the masses with flickering images and bright, pretty colors even if it doesn't make a shred of sense. How else would you account for the success of Michael Bay? ID4 is bad across the board. The dialogue is just awful, I cringe at every other line. Despite the fact that an end-of-the-world scenario is potentially very dramatic there is no real acting in the film at all. Each and every one of the actors speak like they're reading from cue cards being held beside the static camera. Will Smith's irregular ad-libbing is irritating and dates the film even further. Bill Pullman, as much as I like him, stumbles through the film like he's drunk and/or unable to understand English.

Principal photography for ID4 wrapped in well under 3 months. I blame the swift shoot for the obvious lack of rehearsals and decent performances. It's like Roland Emmerich got the film in the can as quickly as possible at the expense of everything that might actually make it worthwhile. His non-effort results in almost the entire film being made of static shots with no hand-held camera movements whatsoever, which castrates ID4 of any sense of urgency or realism. Even the extras are bad, which is pretty sad considering all they have to do is run away from very fake explosions. If they didn't work for free then the production was ripped off.

There's not one likable character. The second round of promos sold it as a Will Smith movie. It's not. He's really a secondary character in a cast filled with secondary characters. The worst subplot features Randy Quaid as a drunk pilot. Whenever the film cuts to his family (and his very annoying, moody, Keanu Reeves lookalike son) it threatens to keel over and die. Emmerich really ought to have been a bit more liberal with the scissors. It's astonishing to think that his director's cut is even longer. As if it were not already too bloated and clumsy.

Of all the would-be greatness, only David Arnold's rousing score truly entertains. Though if your very geeky like me you'll realize that it's merely a plagiarism of Richard Joseph's theme to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Pond-3-Operation-Starfish/dp/B00002SUKL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Pond 3: Operation Starfish</a>.

Worth watching only as a curious, outdated relic of an innocent time long since gone. ID4's enjoyment has long since expired.

The Blu Ray features a pretty good 1080p 2.35:1 picture (of the theatrical cut) with DTS HD-MA sound. Only a few of the extras from the DVD have been ported over.",1037404800,2,3781,5.0287539936102235
828683,1,6304233639,"I, of course rather naively, went into this film in the understanding that this was an 'aliens attack the world and are repelled' sci fi romp. I was sorely misguided. Of course it is America who is attacked by nasty ET and subsequently has to save the world(again). The Devlin/ Emmerich duo(yes I hear you cry, they of Godzilla fame) apparantly believe America alone is capable of coming up with the veritable genius of an idea to steal an alien spaceship, fly a wisecracking military goofball and a typically dour scientist/Goldblum persona..., accompanied by an action packed fighter/alien dogfight, featuring world leaders and drunk crop dusters. Such efforts are met with worldwide celebration of American genius, accompanied by the obligatory hackneyed stereotypes. Note to director- Im sure not all Brits use the word 'bloody' six times per sentence. All in all a overblown piece of mastabatory flag waving, destined nevertheless to reap the benefits of a largely ignorant public. Unfortunately this type of thing seems to pervade Hollywood these days, and i kinda blame myself for putting trust in the film industry. I'll try and forget the whole sorry business and get on with my life.",1036627200,10,1193,5.091836734693878
828684,3,6304233639,"It's damned clear from the opening shot (the American flag on the moon, Neil Armstrong's ""one small step speech"" in the background and the footprints of said astronought and chums) what this is about. Aliens attack the world? Nope. Aliens attack America and get what's coming to them... as if we couldn't guess. Yep, it's that big budget remake of all those B-Movies, with lots of anthems and ""God bless America"" moments. For everyone in America, this will doubtless be the feelgood blockbuster of the year... for the rest of the world, it's probably the biggest, most expensive lump of cheese yet concieved in the movie industry.
The story is nice and simple. Some shamefully mean and nasty aliens descend from the skies, promptly attacking (curiously we see attacks on America and... well, nowhere else, because of course nowhere else would really matter if it was destroyed) and causing mass destruction. The ramifications of this worldwide devastation are never considered, with a general theme of ""America will fix it"" running through. It's jingoistic to sickening extremes, with the President delivering a nice independence day speech and getting in a plane alongside the normal people (for people read Americans) and attacking those nasty aliens with all the American firepower they can muster. Damned inspiring stuff... if you're American.
Of course there's the nice touch that Mr. Average, ""Russell Case"" (often drunken crop duster who claims to have been abducted by aliens) saves the day with the President nobly paving the way for him. Aw. The whole ""Pres'-Helps-Save-The-Day"" thing wouldn't get a full blown movie plot until the equally sickening Air Force One, but here it's a little subplot and still an annoying one. Let's be honest... Presidents are puppets, always out of harm's way, and NEVER likely to get stuck into the action. Now I've had my go at that subject, I'll continue.
America of course leads the way in saving the world, showing how to destroy the alien beasties by bringing down their ships (and, presumably, crushing miles of land beneath, and causing vast dust clouds, similar to an asteroid collision? Oh well). In fact, the only footage of ""the rest of the world dealing with the problem"" is a few clips of stereotypical foreigners. For the English we have the likes of ""crikey, aliens are invading! Better put the kettle on"" and so forth. Nobody seems to mind that aliens invading the world actually involves the rest of the world. Oh well.
Anyway, if you can swallow the absurd jingoism, is it actually a good film? Well, Jeff Goldblum - yet again playing his terminal character, the scatterbrained noble genius, but he does it well and is amusing in all his scenes. Bill Puttman is a questionably brave and strong president, probably ranking above the rest of the rather over-comical cast (Will Smith, love him or hate him, does what he does best - yell, do action scenes and come out with one-liners). And the script, oh the script... cheese left right and centre, with aliens whose motives are as simple and clear cut as the film's intention: to make a LOT of money. Which it shamelessly did.
The effects are, of course, grand and good. The flying saucers look far meaner than their wobbly ancestors, and the aliens are just as tenticle-clad and slimy as you'd expect. It's all very predictable, yet pleasing in it's reliability. And of course it's entertaining throughout, delivering nothing but eye-pleasing action and lots of loud noises. Yes, despite it's irritating themes, it's fun.
It's well worth the title of blockbuster, and is truly suited to those with brains firmly switched off. So I can watch it and like it if I don't think about it - and some of it's moments (Puttman's speech, from a certain perspective - and Russell Case's delightful final moments: ""Hello boys, I'm back!"" and ""Payback's a b**ch aint it!"" for example) are touching and funny. So there is definitely fun to be had, and it is, as much as it pains me to say it, definitely worth watching it.
For non-Americans it will prove a guilty pleasure, and for those for whom it was made, it will prove a heart-melting flag waver and no mistake. So watch it, laugh at or with it, and enjoy it anyway.",1035763200,2,4216,4.856944444444444

828686,1,6304233639,"This movie has been called ""wonderful"" and ""a great sc-fi movie for the modern times"". Anyone who said that is obviously under some sort of trance or perhaps on drugs. This movie, at the most, is a ""B"" class flik with absolutely no plot and little acting ability. They could have at least made the movie make sense to make up for its horrible acting and scripting but no, it is incoherent dribble. For one thing, it takes place in 4 DAYS! All of that takes place in four days. What? Second of all, how young is that president? You have to be over thirty to be a president and he looks to be thirty at the oldest, possibly younger.
  I also noticed that logistics played no part in the making of this movie. The directors said, ""We want him to be in a desert."" So they put him in huge desert, where there isn't one in real life! Then there's the whole thing about them just saying, ""Anyone who can fly or, heck, as even looked at a plane, come over here  and we'll give you some top of the line jets to use."" but don't get me started. Plus there is the scene where the city gets hit and the lady hides in a small room right next to where the flames are coming and doesn't even get first degree burns.
  As for the acting, it is abysmal. But perhaps that's just because it is a horrible plot with crummy dialogue. They throw in mediocre jokes that are repetetive and stupid to begin with.
  Finally, the ending doesn't even makes sense. Even if they did destroy the aliens, they still have radiation in the atmosphere and all of their major cities have been wiped out. What will they do about the economy? Luckily, they don't have to worry about it because they'll all be dead from radiation sickness in a few days anyway.
  SO, in closing, I agree with everyone else who has given this a bad review and I pity the one person who said that they've seen it twelve times. You poor, disturbed man. It is the worst movie ever created that I have seen (besides ""Glen or Glenda"", I also pity anyone who has actually seen that). Do not buy or rent this movie, unless you enjoying laughing and making fun of movies. Instead you could just go stab yourself with hot fire pokers or possibly light your hair on fire or something equally enjoyable, you'd have as much fun as if you saw this movie.",1034553600,10,2283,4.278422273781903

828688,5,6304233639,"In 1996, a film called Independence Day exploded onto the world and caused a frenzy in the Box Office. The film is the second most successful sci-fi film of all-time after Star Wars in 1997. Independence Day grossed a staggering $811 million worldwide - the highest box office gross of a sci-fi film on its original release and made huge stars of Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Independence Day is without a doubt one of the greatest films of all-time. Yes, the script may be corny at times, but the special effects are absolutely mind-blowing! And that's waht makes a good action film, isn't it? People want to see the special effects and be entertained. Films like these aren't meant to have depth and meaning - they're purely there to entertain you and Independence Day definitely does that! The storyline to Independence Day is pretty basic really...

An alien space ship one-fourth the mass of the moon is headed toward Earth, and no one is sure what will happen when it arrives. The president of the United States (Bill Pullman) can only watch as the ship settles into orbit and dispatches several ""smaller"" craft that take position above every major city in the world. While the president tries to prevent a panic, few people can stay calm at the sight of 15-mile-long space ships hovering over their cities. When Marine Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is called to duty, he's sure the aliens didn't fly all this way just to pick a fight - but he tells his girlfriend to take her son and leave Los Angeles, just in case. Meanwhile, computer genius David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers that the aliens are using Earth's satellites for their own purpose. In fact, they are counting down. David rounds up his eccentric father (Judd Hirsch) and sets off to explain what's happening to his ex-wife (Margaret Colin). She's the president's communication director, and when David tells her what the aliens are up to, she convinces the president to listen. He quickly orders the cities evacuated and rushes to Air Force One. As the countdown reaches zero, the aliens show the people of Earth exactly what they are planning. They begin an all-out war with no negotiation, no compromise and no mercy. In fact, the human race may well have only one chance to save itself from complete extermination. They realise that all the space ships have an incredibly powerful protective barrier around them. When bombs are sent flying towards the ships, they just bounce off like a tennis ball. Levinson flies into space towards the mother ship with Steven Hiller to infiltrate the ship with a virus which in turn will remove the protective barrier from all the space ships hovering over the Earth's major cities. Independence Day really is the BIG and ultimate sci-fi film of the 1990's. Director by Ronald Emmerich does a brilliant job with giving the audience a fantastic, thrilling time. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are the main two and are excellent in their roles and the comedy factor of the film works rather well, unlike in some other films that are disasterous in trying to get the audience to laugh. The way the film is worked around is an ingenious idea - the fact that all this happens around the days on July 4th and that the world fights back in unison on Independence Day is brilliant.

OVERALL GRADE: 9/10

Regardless of whether your a fan of sci-fi films with an overall Star Wars feel (I hate all the Star Wars films), you will enjoy this film because it's so gripping and suspenseful. They don't spend 30 minutes talking a load of jibberish like in some other films - they get straight into what the film is about. Which I suppose can be a good thing or a bad thing - but in this case it's definitely the former. The final battle where they finally gain access to destroying the space ships is absolutely incredible - the sheer size of these ships is indescribable and the way the ship is finally destroyed is huge - like the Titanic sinking (in the film) but 100 times more epic and monsterous!

weapons, even nuclear bombs are useless. Additionally the invaders from both movies even use a force field to protect their fighting craft. There are other likenesses, but I'll not reveal them all.
The casting director did a grand job of picking the players. I
especially enjoyed Randy Quade as an alcoholic crop duster and
Robert Loggia as a gruff army general. All in all performances were quite good.

The plot is thoroughly described in other reviews, so I won't belabor it here.  Suffice to say that its implausibility is really irrelevant, and for most viewers, that will not be a problem.
What I liked about the movie the first time and on each successive viewing, were the great special effects (I cannot understand the reviewers who found them to be deficient) and the way that humor is used throughout the movie.  I also enjoyed the subplots and the fact that the characters are developed enough to be individuals, not just a group of anonymous Earthlings.
Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith are great together, and seem to be enjoying themselves.  The other actors are good in their roles, too.
Some people are critical of this movie for not succeeding as a patriotic movie, or for trying to be one in the first place.  I agree that some of the President's appeals to humanity might sound hokey, but within the context of this movie, it didn't seem out of place to me at all.

And while the majority of viewers dismissed it as a cliched alien-invasion film, I still stand as one of its defenders.  For sure, it doesn't hold a candle to ""Close Encounters...,"" but it's still a watchable, above-average flick despite its hokey touches.  The plot is simple: aliens come to earth and destroy major cities around the US (If you haven't seen the picture of the White House blown to bits, you clearly don't get out much).  The president (a Clinton-esque Bill Bullman) calls upon military services to fight these creatures.  That's when a bigshot Marine (Will Smith) comes in to save the day.  That's the plot in a nutshell.  The special effects are good but not great, and the suspense leading to the attack keeps the viewer glued to the story.  Trust me, I have seen far worse ""event"" summer movies that are doubly unoriginal and rely on cliches that are just as tired.

While it certainly isn't cerebral by any stretch of the imagination, it is a good  family film.  It isn't intended to be a great work of cinematic art, but what it is intended to do it does.  It appeals to the child like desire for good to overcome evil, to the desire of a parent to be able to present himself in a good light to his/her children, to the desire for world harmony in a time when it seems perilously close to wide spread destruction.  As other reviewers point out, there is a little for everyone in this film: a brave, decent, pilot... president; a beautiful black stripper with a heart of gold and her adorable little boy; a computer nerd whose knowledge saves the world; an attractive, muscular, black guy to act the part of a good role model for young males; a wedding; a reconciliation--in fact several; a recovered alcoholic father of three who saves the day and makes his children proud of him again; etc.  This is a film that attempts to fulfill the need for fantasy in all of us.  It does so just as Harry Potter does through wish fulfillment; it just does it with more of a ""boom.""  The film is definitely a catch all that was intended to market well by its broad spectrum approach to story telling, but that doesn't mean that it isn't an entertaining tale none the less.  Like The War of the Worlds it's an ""us against them"" sort of film, but unlike the latter, it has it's funny moments, in fact many of them.  Brent Spinner--everybody's favorite synthetic life form--gives a wonderful performance as a slightly off beat and out of step director of Area 51, while Randy Quaid does a brilliant characterization of a derelict and ditzy hero who rises to the occasion once again when duty calls.  Will Smith is constantly getting off witty one liners that seem to capture the moment in pithy humor.  Jeff Goldblum played Jeff Goldblum, just as he always does, but as always too is very entertaining to watch.  My greatest disappointment was the women of the story.  Vivica Fox, as Jasmine, had the most active and interesting role among them, her motivating force being the well being of her little boy and the man she loved.  None of the other women seemed to take an active part in anything.  They seemed just along for the ride,  watching the drama take place in front of them, often showing less involvement than many women do over their favorite soap!  A great disappointment to someone who grew up with Honey West, Emma Peel, the Girl from Uncle and other examples of active female participation in action adventures.  The fine CGI finale makes one  want to ""salute the flag,"" at least of the United Nations, as humanity once again defeats those nasty aliens with our human ingenuity and determination.

The story-line is pretty weak, but that's okay, this is a movie designed to entertain, not make you think.  The initial build up and deployment of the alien space craft is my favourite segment of the movie.  It's the second part of the movie that things start to go wrong.  There are just too many cheesey bits which ruin the movie.  Will Smith's first encounter with the downed alien craft is a huge disappointment.  He sees an alien, punches it, then sits back and has a cigar.  Nice line ""Welcome to earth"", but the whole scene is a real let down.  One punch and the alien is knocked out? What about other aliens in the craft?  What about his curiosity as to what else is inside the craft, he is a pilot who wants to be an astronaut for crying out loud?  Then there are other ridiculous scenes such as the President giving his patriotic speech, which sounds like it was written to be given to a whole nation, or nations and he delivers it to a handful of people.  But the worst part of the movie for me, was when a handful of civilians (albiet Vietnam vets) end up flying F18's.  This unfortunately is just stretching things too far. At the risk of getting some negative feedback for this review, I found it pretty sycophantic when the movie panned around the world, to see military survivors from different nations listening in to the Americans.  The British soldier made the comment about relying on the Americans. This scene merely shows Americans as being full of the themselves and condescending and wasn't necessary.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but it misses the mark terribly for the reasons above.  The Five Star Collection version is the equivilant of my Region 4 Special Edition version.

Upon it's release, critcs bemoaned the film's over-the-top jingionism, cheesy heroic antics and disaster movie cliche staples- ""Oh, quick, save the dog before the giant fireball destroys the city!"" And to be fair, the film did deserve it's critisism, but as a cheesy, sentimental sci fi action blockbuster, it's one of the best.
For all Will Smith's jibes and Bill Pullman's heroics, it's Jeff Goldblum who comes off as the main man, pulling the same shtick as in Jurassic Park (""Must go faster!""). The film does get very silly at times, but never takes itself too seriously, creating a feel-good tone that works well within the caveats of the genre. Emmerich's ham-fisted direction gets tiresome at times, with so many sci fi cliches, you start to wish someone had thrown in an original idea or two. But the film gets four stars for action, visuals and some well-timed humour.
The SFX utilised are astounding, with some truly breathtaking visuals, and that now-famous shot of the white house getting blown to smithereens by aliens! It's good-natured, brainless fun, that while predictable and silly, is still one impressive movie that is a must-have on DVD. The extras are great, with commentaries on the first disc, and on disc 2 a wealth of extras including that famous Superbowl trailer ""Enjoy the Superbowl, it may be your last"", tons of ""making of"" docos and lots more production info.",1023408000,2,1540,4.996108949416342

Only Will Smith can stop these slimy things with the help of Jeff Goldblum (who resembles my good friend Somitr). Check mate, alien terrorism has never been so terrifying. Explosions all over, but it takes about an hour to get to the action. Fire trucks, cars and people fly in the debris and a dog jumps away from fire just in time. Lucky pup! Will Smith fights the aliens with his jet and Jeff Goldblum takes away their invisible forcefield. How quick he is! The two men fly an alien spacecraft and go back to space to take out the mother spaceship. I was struggling to stay awake during this overblown, goofball movie. The President of the United States is played by Bill Pullman and he delivers one of the most cheesy speeches of all time. ""Because today is our independence day!"" He was talking to about a hundred people out of the whole country.

828814,4,6304233639,"After having read some of the other reviews of this movie, I am almost ashamed to say how much I enjoy it.  Oh well!!
It is many of the things the others complain about, a very typical Hollywood mid-summer special effects, over the top, action flick. However I do find it entertaining if you want an evening of fairly mindless enjoyment.
The special effects are good for their time, and still hold up fairly well.  The plot line (what there is) is predictable. The acting is mediocre thru ok.
Will Smith is just fine for me as a Marine Corps fighter pilot.  Some of his lines are a little much, but he and Jeff Goldblum work well off of each other.
Jeff Goldblum (whom I normally do not care for) is good as a typical science nerd, save the planet freak.  I for once actully enjoyed his part in a movie.
The Randy Quaid role could and should have been completely rewritten.  I understand what they were trying to do with him, however it is almost embarresing to watch some of his scenes. I hope he was paid lots of money for going thru this.
The likable Bill Pullman as President of the US....Hmmm I am still working on that. He gives the best he's got, and comes across as a decent choice for the role, but I really do feel that the role could have been cast more beleivably.
The most likable characters are the 'second tier' actors.  Judd Hirsch, and Robert Loggia stand out in my mind as really fullfilling their tasks in the movie.
If you buy this movie in the DVD format, choose to watch the version with the ""cut"" scenes in it.  It makes alot more sense and seems to flow better.
While I wouldnt put ID4 in my list of must see movies, it aint all that bad either.",1021507200,,1669,4.279365079365079
828815,3,6304233639,"Another movie about aliens taking over the earth does initially sound a little boring.  The special effects are good, just the sight of the White House being incinerated and Air Force One flying in front of a wall of flame are thought provoking enough.  Add into the equation Area 51 and the ever present thought that it is a possiblity that no one can deny with any certainty and this is a very thought provoking movie.
On the flip side, imagine a stripper and the first lady becoming friends.  An alcoholic crop duster flying U.S. military planes, a jilted ex-husband (who once punched the President) being allowed into the White House to see his ex-wife in the company of the President, the President flying fighter planes in combat and you see the more unbelievable aspect of this film.  But hey, it's the movies and anything is possible.
When all is considered this movie is not bad but not great.  Certainly worth the price of admission in a theater or a home rent but I don't believe it will go down as one that is remembered for a very long time.  But in the short run while you are watching and for some time after it will certainly be interesting.",1019260800,,1157,4.511961722488039
828816,1,6304233639,"I saw this movie in the theater originally and had a decent memory of it.  It was a fun summer movie and the special effects were great.  So when this two DVD THX version came out, I bought a copy.  I wish I had stuck with my memories, because it is such a cheesy movie watching it now, almost six years later.
The special effects are still decent, but can't really compare with what they do nowadays.  And since the special effects can no longer compensate for the screenplay (or lack thereof),  there is really nothing to the movie, even watching it from a purely entertainment standpoint.
Giving the movie every benefit of the doubt possible, there are still so many things that make it virtually unwatchable.  Here are just a couple:
-- The acting is just so shallow and non-passionate.  Millions of people die when the aliens destroy entire cities, yet the cast, including the supposed President of the U.S. (a poorly cast Bill Pullman) is on a plane joking around hours later with no apparent sadness for what happened.
-- Scientists have been studying an alien spaceship at Area 51 for 40 years, yet Jeff Goldblum (in the same role he played in Jurassic Park) is able to come in, decipher the ship's secrets, and get the ship ready to fly in 24 hours.
-- Will Smith steals a helicopter when he finds out his hometown is destroyed (and thus his girlfriend and girlfriend's son), and manages to land within 50 yards of where his girlfriend has survived and camped out (and coincidentally found the first lady of the U.S. on the side of what used to be a road)
-- The part about planting a computer virus in the mother ship isn't even worth mentioning.
In summary, I would recommend that if you have good memories of this movie from when it came out, please leave them as good memories and don't ruin them by watching this movie again.  I wish I had this advice.",1017273600,19,1866,4.5

The special effects were satisfyingly awesome and the overall pace quick--funny at the right time, hair-raising at others.

Or after they shoot the first ship down, wouldn't the aliens figure it out and prevent it? The list goes on and on. The plot becomes terribly cartoonish and juvenile to the point I was actually embarassed being in the theater watching it.

With the exception of a few Matrix-like camera tricks (and Sky Captain-like 100%-animation schemes), little technology has visibly improved to the average moviegoer since the days of ID4.  Audio is breathtaking.  Characters are fairly well-developed and likeable for a testosterone-based shoot-em-up.  It has enough love story elements to keep the soft-core audeience intrigued.  Intellectually stimulating enough not to be ludicrous.  What is there to complain about?

More subtle than ""Armageddon,"" and twice as funny as ""Mars Attacks,"" this baby features the largest collection of stereotyped characters since Irwin Allen released ""Earthquake"" in Sensurround.

Honestly, Smith is the best thing about this movie; he proves he has the big-screen presence to carry a film.  Or maybe he comes off so well because all the other characters are papier-mache, or something like that.  Jeff Goldblum plays... well, Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch despoils his formerly decent film career as Goldblum's Jewish Dad (he wouldn't be out of place in a 1930's radio show).  Then there's Harvey Fierstein as the Funny Gay Guy, and Harry Connick, Jr. as the Doomed Best Friend, and Mary McDonnell as the Saintly First Lady.  Factor in Randy Quaid as the comic-relief Crazy Guy and couple of Cute Kids with mooncalf eyes.  Somewhere in there we get strippers, a marital reconciliation, a wedding and a computer virus, plus a lot of heartfelt moments carefully lifted from better movies.  And explosions, explosions, explosions.

This is one of those movies where unheralded billions die in spectacular SFX fireballs and CGI imagery, but a dog gets a slow motion leap to safety.  Granted, the effects are sharp and the battle scenes are truly massive.  But as long as the dog survives, why should we care about any of the people?

However, the joy of 'Independence Day' is precisely that - it never pretends to be anything else.  As pure escapist fun it's the top of its range.  The premise is childishly simple: have a group of alien ships hover over the world's great cities and watch how the humans react.  Not only is this an alien movie that takes advantage of the 'X-Files' phenomena but it's also a disaster movie, with there being a cross-section of America reacting to the events around them.
The acting is surprisingly good whilst remaining thankfully low-key.  Smith especially shows his star potential, and can obviously carry a movie by himself.  Around him are the more seasoned actors such as Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman as the president.  The special effects are mind-blowing and the creators obviously had a lot of fun making the movie, although at times melodrama does threaten to sink everything.  What's perhaps most cloying though is its blatant vision of a world crisis that only affects America and one that only America can combat.

828869,4,6304233639,"I thought that this was a very enjoyable movie.  It's one of those movies that you watch again and again because there are several moments that are just unforgettable.  The effects are top-notch, especially in the early parts of the film, as we see city-sized spacecraft appearing almost out of nowhere to hover over major world cities, and then once all is ready, blasting them into rubble.  (Of course, the shot of New York City on the morning after the destruction, with the World Trade Center damaged but still standing, is especially poignant now.)  However, the movie as a whole is hardly a deep science fiction drama.  I agree with those who maintain that the plot is paper-thin, with several gaping holes in logic.  But, if you can suspend your disbelief successfully for a couple of hours, this movie is a lot of fun to watch.
The cast is pretty good.  Will Smith shines as the gung-ho Marine Steven Hiller.  Jeff Goldblum is also great as David Levinson, the computer geek who just happens to be the ex-husband of the President's press secretary.  Bill Pullman is suitably George Bush-like as the President.  James Rebhorn is the creepy defense secretary who almost seems like he is on the aliens' payroll until the President finally gets fed up with him.  The underrated Robert Loggia is the Chairman of the JCS.  But, the two actors who steal the show are Judd Hirsch as Jeff Goldblum's cranky dad, and Brent Spiner as a whacked-out alien research scientist, who really should have had some security in his operating room.
To me, the best parts of the film are all the sly in-jokes that parody other movies.  Some of the best ones include:
(1)  The point where Randy Quaid flies over a rural road - the shot from his point of view is EXACTLY the same shot as when Kal-El's rocket from Krypton crashed to earth in Superman:The Movie.
(2)  Right after that, Randy comes in for a landing on the same road - just like John Belushi with his P-40 in 1941.
(3)  ""Good Morning, Dave"" - right out of 2001.
(4)  Those alien spaceships have more than a passing resemblance to the ships from the ""V"" TV miniseries.
(5)  The sequence where Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith infiltrate the alien mother ship in their captured fighter is reminiscent of the V'ger flyover from Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
There's plenty more where those came from, but I think you get the idea.  Basically, this movie is not too deep, but then, it never intended to be.  If you can just relax and enjoy it for a couple of hours, you will love this film.  If, on the other hand, you are one of those who just climbs the wall every time Jeff Goldblum is able to plug his laptop into the alien ship's computer and instantly interface with an alien computer network, then you should give this one a pass.",1013472000,2,2777,4.558467741935484

It was supposed to be the movie of the century!!! ... at least that was what we were being told.  And it looked like it probably would be.
Then I went to see it ... with eyes-wide and excited; hand buried in popcorn.  Then... I realized, about forty minutes in ... I'd been conned.  Never in my life did I feel so stupid ... I had fallen for it.  I had fallen foolishly for the most hyped movie of all time.
This wasn't the movie of the century... it was a two-hour commercial.  It was a scatter-brained, poorly-written, poorly-directed fiasco.  Other than the incredible special effects that went to waste on INDEPENDENCE DAY, the movie only deserved to be shown on the DISNEY CHANNEL... once.
A movie that was written so poorly that it went from joking around one second, to nuking Houston the next (anyone know anybody in Houston? ... apparently no one who made this movie did, because they sure didn't care).
An alien movie that was about as scary as your local christian church's haunted house.  A movie that couldn't figure out whether it wanted to be a comedy, a thriller, or a UPN movie of the week.
And then came the ... finale ... ""I'M BACK!!!""  And they all came tumbling down.

828947,5,6304233639,"This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.

The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.

Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.

This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.

Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.

The quality of this two disc DVD is superlative with crystal clear visuals and great sound quality.

1.  Large city-sized spaceships floating over the world's major cities.  Sounds like something that either came out of the 1980s television series V or the classic science fiction novel Childhood's End by Arthur C. Clarke.
2.  The insectile shape of the alien beings themselves are taken from the ALIEN movies.
3.  The fact that the mother ships are impervious to even nuclear weapons was stolen from the great 1950s version of War of the Worlds.
4.  The fighter pilots are little more than caricatures from Top Gun, a horrible and derivative film in and of itself.
5.  The Area 51 scene was done much better in a lousy film called Hangar 18.
But if stealing ideas was not enough, the producers had to go even further by insulting the intellect of anyone over 5 years old.  Ask yourself these two questions:
1.  How could a fighter pilot, no matter how well trained, instantly learn to fly an alien fighter craft?
2.  How could a human designed computer system transfer a virus into the alien central computer?  You don't have to answer since Apple was quick to commercialize here?
I shouldn't bad mouth this movie so much.  Blockbusters like this - and Armageddon - are made for one purpose alone: to make money.  If is derivative, empty of all meaningful content except for computer generated eye candy, and manipulative; then so be it.",1006819200,3,1569,4.577060931899641

I paid the matinee ticket price, so that redeems me somewhat... but there's some nice energy here, great special effects, and I'm always glad when female strippers make an appearance (in a PG-13 movie, no less!).
First, I'd have to give a thumbs down to the restored footage in the Special Edition cut of the movie.  There is no stuff blowing up in the restored footage (which explains why it was probably cut to begin with), and they certainly weren't doing anyone a favor by subjecting us to more horrible acting.
Personally, I enjoyed the creature design and most of the action.  The ending does leave a lot to be desired.  Okay, yes, a computer virus is a good idea, but it'd probably take years to learn and develop programs for an alien computer network... as opposed to the mere seconds that are devoted to it in the movie.  I expected to hear some wry comment from Pullman, Goldblum, and/or Will Smith about how easily they were able to infect the alien systems with the virus, but they instead just kept blowing stuff up.
So, the movie is a bit silly albeit exciting, and I'd much rather see Special Editions of more important films.  As far as audio and video transfers go, I didn't encounter any problems with the discs unlike some other viewers.

ID4. Its big and loud and fun, but also cliched and unforgivably dumb at times. A huge factory built corporate-sponsored Blockbuster. A giant cheese-filled Gordita(tm) of a movie. It aims to please, and sometimes does quite well. It also is filled with seen-it-before moments(Literally! It just plain steals them from other movies) and a shallow mix of drama and comedy. There is also this attitude of ""Hey! Major cities have been vaporized! Let's crack bad jokes about it!"" Some emotions might have been nice.
The DVD has many cool extras, especially the Easter Eggs of the raw footage of the news broadcasts.
Its a bit hard to imagine watching this movie anytime soon, given recent events, but, let's face it, when we first saw the preview with the exploding White House, we all went ""Kewl!""

829009,2,6304233639,"This movie was ""OK"" (it came out during the Clinton Presidency, so when they blew up the White House there was quite a bit of cheering in the theater - you do have to appreciate that), but the story isn't original. I personally like the 50s Sci Fi movies myself, and the War of the Worlds was a much more interesting movie than this expensive remake. (Let's go to the original book by H. G. Wells to see how old this story really is). War of the Worlds was certainly was a more suspenseful movie. Can't Hollywood come up with anything original anymore? The special effects in this were good, no doubt about that, but they weren't really believable (name one person that you know that can outrun an explosion in a tunnel). That's Hollywood for you.
For excitement and effects, this is a movie that is worth watching. If it's a good story with suspense and a little bit of intelligence that you want to see, than the original War of the Worlds is a much better choice. I think that Gene Barry is a much better actor than Will Smith is and his character was more interesting than the Will Smith character we have in this version of the film. Gene Barry was scared and unsure of the outcome of the invasion in the original (lets face it, he lost all hope but fought to the end and never gave up and understood that the defeat was due to a higher power than man and science) and Will Smith's character was cocky and sure that we could win in Independence Day. Unlike War of the Worlds, there was no doubt how this story would end in this version. It would be nice for Hollywood to have an ounce of creativity and originality in making movies these days, but they won't do that. Hollywood even had to resort to a computer ""virus"" to defeat the alien invasion in this version rather than a cold virus from the original. Couldn't they come up with another way for the human race to prevail? They rely on special effects to sell tickets. The amount they spend on one explosion could certainly pay for a writer with talent and ability.

  This has got to be one of the funnest movies out there. It's got everything needed in a movie. Action (That's what the movie is all about), drama (A couple of subplots that were dealt with very nicely and not left open), comedy (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Randy Quaid - what do you expect from these great actors?), horror (I count the ""jump"" moments given by the aliens as horror), and of course, science fiction (Er...the aliens). The extensive cast is full of A list actors and actresses, as well as some unknowns, and all pull through with great performances. And I must say, when Bill Pullman gives his own ""Independence Day"" speech, I was ready to fight the aliens with them. I also enjoyed how each group of characters were given their own subplots, and those subplots were closed and didn't leave the viewers wondering how what would have happened. The special effects in ID4 were amazing. It was pretty fun to see Washington DC, Paris, and other big cities get blown to pieces. The aerial fights were also pretty awesome.
  The DVD lives up to its ""5 Star Collection"" title. We get the original theatrical release on one disc, and the uncut version on another.

Will Smith is certainly not my favorite actor, but he turns in a suprisingly strong performance as a Marine fighter pilot ace.  Bill Pulman is a likeable, youthfull president who was a fighter pilot himself during Desert Storm.  [Now, class, 3 guesses as to why the writers put in the President of the United States as a former fighter pilot, please.  Could it be that they want the President himself to go ballistic on some aliens, maybe?].
The one fatal flaw of this movie is that it is unbelievable to anyone who has ever been in the military, or knows anything at all about the military.  These huge, 5 mile long flying saucers come to earth, and apparently all the military has to use against them are air-to-air missiles and nuclear bombs.  Excuse me?  I would think that there would be stuff in-between sidewinders and Nuclear missiles that we could fire at these nasty aliens....I mean, trying to knock  a gargantuan alien mothership out of the sky with sidewinders is a bit like trying to knock out George Foreman using nothing but jabs.
Anyway, word has it that the military was excited about collaborating with this film project, just as they have done with movies such as ""Crimson Tide,"" ""The Rock"" and many others.  However, a glitch came up when the military advisors learned that some of the movie was to concentrate on all of the mythology / hoopla behind the infamous ""Area 51.""  I'm sure everyone is aware of those rumours, so there is no reason to go into them.  Anyway, as soon as the Brass learned about this, the military washed its hands of the project.  So, what you end up with is basically what the original writers seemed to be looking for:  a cross between ""Star Wars"" and ""Top Gun.""

Wonder why Judd Hirsch accepted the insulting role of ""the wise jew"".  Wonder why Robert Loggia couldn't find anything better to do with his time.  But please, don't pay to see this disaster.

If you haven't seen this one yet you need to - it's a classic.  Keep in mind that it was not intended to be a deadly serious film.  It is highly interspersed with comic relief efforts by several fine actors, and with the exception of perhaps one scene in a stripper bar (no-she does not take all her clothes off), the film is also highly viewable by young adults.  Very young children may not be ready for the violent content or the concept of real-looking aliens, but on the other hand the language is basically kid-friendly.

ID4 is simply great.  After purchasing it on DVD I watched for about the fifth time, and I realized that this is probably my favorite movie ever.  The special effects are unparalled.  The drama is there, every moment as the perilous situation changes.  Bill Pullman is a refreshing politician, and the romance between Jeff Goldblum and his ex-wife (in the movie) is great.  It was great that we switched between several different characters for the first part of the movie and then at the end they all came together.  I admit that there are one or two corny lines, but they are overpowered by all the greatness this movie has to offer.  In regards to the special features on the DVD, there is only one that I found to be really great.  That was the extra footage.  It was neat to see about 9 minutes of extra pieces that were not in the original movie.  I found the other special features to be somewhat boring, but that's ok, I just went back and watched the movie again!

Most of the complaints this movie gets, I belive are undeserved. People who criticize this movie tell people to leave their IQ at home... Maybe they should have brought their IQ along to understand the movie! First the people who complain that the movie is too much focused on America.... WTF? Can you please tell me what the name of the movie is? Indepenence Day (ID4) an american holliday! c'mon get a clue, of course it is going to be biased in favor of america, it is only the most important American Holiday! another problem people have with the move is that the acting is horrible... well I won't touch much on that one since that is subject to opinon... all Ill say is watch it again... the DVD version has more of the Story intact... and watch the part where the ""firt kid"" says ""is mommy sleeping"" and the pres says ""yeah... mommys sleeping"" and tell me you don't feel anything.... the other problem people have a hard time with is the part, or parts i should say; where Jeff Goldblum is able to dicipher the alien code in the satilite and where he can connect to the alien ship with his laptop... first... the alien ships where using human satilites, where everything is in binary(how all our compuers are Binary)... and Jeff Being a 8 year MIT Grad probably has a good understanding of reading binary... and all he did was find a hidden binary code that wasn't supposed to be there, he filtered it out and realized that it was a count down(in short). the one that most people have a problem with is when he interfaces with the alien ship using his laptop.... well think about it! they have had an alein ship there to study for 30+ years... how do you think they were studing the alien technology?with computers! Im sure they developed some sort of interface adapter to the alien technology that allowed our computers to interface with alien computers... what, you want them to show you how they make it so you know it works and then you can say this is a beliveable movie? C'mon guys Use your IQ you have so much of, take it to the movie next time, im sure youll like it the movie much more. the only issue with the movie are the shortcuts it takes... like when will smith finds his girlfriend among the rubble of EL Toro, or when he finds Area 51 with the RV caravan. or how Wills girlfriend finds the first lady, or how Jeff's girl friend is in a position to get a meeting with the president So Jeff can Give the critical info to the pres just in time... but all that is to just make the movie more fun. thats all the movie tries to be... just a Kick A$$ joy ride! enjoy it for what it is and don't cut it down for something that it isn't even trying to be.",985305600,,2789,4.324427480916031

I can't say I hated this lame story as much as I absolutely loathed Armageddon, but it's close.  Why, oh why can't they have a script before they start cranking out fast food tie-ins? And why do I keep thinking just maybe *this* will be the blockbuster that actually amounts to something other than frequent eye-rolling at the endless cliches and overall BADNESS of it?  God awful stuff, especially all of the characters and the horrid dialogue.  And that Randy Quaid character...jeeez.
OK...I'll admit to liking one scene in the film.  It's where Will Smith gets up in the morning and goes out to get the paper, still half asleep, and finally starts to notice his panicked neighbors fleeing, and finally the huge spaceship looming on the horizon.

Sure, there's plenty of action, and little else. Will Smith plays a fighter pilot, Jeff Goldblum a computer expert, and Bill Pullman plays the President in this film. This movie, in which aliens invade the Earth, cannot be called science fiction. Science fiction is Star Wars, 2001, and Starship Troopers. This movie does do exactly what it set out to do. The special effects are incredible, the sound is extremely good, the alien ships do look, alien. On the other hand, the aliens themselves are laughable, as is the ""plot"", which should make comic-book writers shudder. Pancake characters round out this film that was so successful the first time they are selling it again so that the company can get more cash to make more movies like this.

829229,3,6304233639,"Yes the usual ""aliens are coming"" stuff  but - the most amazing thing for me was the strange parallel
Lets's see  we have a young president with a can-do attitude He has a cute daughter...and a very workaholic wife....any of this sound familiar? Oh, and of course the President saves the world.
I thought the whole thing was a somewhat subliminal attempt by Hollywood to get us to relate dear old Bill Clinton to the heroism of the films presidential character...all a bit too much for me and I'm a Clinton supporter
As for the rest of the film, as usual these days, the effects distracted us from a pretty mundane plot and a stupid ending ( with the obligatory nuclear blasts etc.)
Just one question. If the aliens were so advanced that they could build huge intergalactic spaceships and conquer everything in their path, don't you think they would have had the alien equivalent of Dr Norton to detect computer viruses? I cant even get my computer to speak to the internet reliably but apparently interfacing a macintosh laptop to an alien spacecraft is a piece of cake.

  On a normal uneventful day an invading mother ship sends out sevral 15 mile wide destroyer ships to the earth in every major city in the world , as the media trys to alert the public widespread panic is in full force , when it's not sure weither  the ships are hostile a scientist finds a signal in a sattleite that the ships will indeed launch a full scale attack on July  2nd they arrive but in July 3rd when thr white house makes a
futile move to contact the ships , they finally attack sending there plasma beams to destroy everything in sight inculding an attack on the White House itself the attack seems forever and  after it's done laid waste and ruiens will be nothing but all thats left of the earth humanity with the help of the president must immobilize a full scale attack before there is nothing left  of humanity to defend Independence Day will never be looked the  same in this huge invasion epic.
  An incredible all star cast include Will Smith , Bill Pullman ,Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, Harvey Fierstein, there has  not been a cast like this since The Posiden Adventure on the DVD Volker Engel takes you through the specal and visual effects on  this film you'll be suprised to know that even though most of the effects looked digital they were done in a very conventional way  for instance when we first get a glimpse of the destroyer while  it's hovering in all it's glory over the brookln bridge it was  done with a large scale 5 foot wide modle of the ship and a , matte painting of the clouds it looks incredible in the movie.
  There is also a hokey mockumentary that is just part of the  experience of ID4 it at times will make you laugh and the making of Independence Day hosted by Jeff Goldblum and creating reality the specal effects documetary wich is a worth while viewing and the big entry Independence Day:Specal Edition with over 9 minutes of unreleased footage not shown in theatres , so grab the biggest invasion movie on DVD your sure to be happy with this Sci Fi epic .",975715200,,2617,4.444444444444445

Director Roland Emmerich as assembled great talents to produce the ultimate ""B"" movie with an ""A"" budget.  The film is basically a disaster film, one so simple in premise that you may ask yourself why schlockmiester Irwin Allen didn't produce such a film in the 1970's.
The film is about a mysterious alien race who arrive two days before the fourth of July and begin blowing cities apart with massive energy beams.  Think ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" meets ""Aliens"" with a dash of ""V: The Final Battle"".  As the world reacts in horror to the extermination of the human race we meet our principle heroes.  We meet an idealistic president (Bill Pullman), a computer genius (Jeff Goldblum) and a cocky Air Force pilot (Will Smith) who lives with his stripper girlfriend.
The rest of the plot involves the president, the computer genius and the jet pilot coming together via convenient plot developments to rally remaining human forces to combat this alien threat.  One bit of inspired writing has the president and his team going to the mysterious Area 51 to find a way to fight the aliens.
Although a bit corny at times, ID4 is so much fun that it's easy to overlook some questionable acting and some gaping plot holes.  Wouldn't an alien race as advanced as this have an anti-virus program for thier ships?  Also, wouldn't alien fighters be able to outspeed an F-15?  Ah, who cares the movie rocks.

Information like the US military did not support the film because Area 51 was mentioned, makes you wonder. Most of the added minutes in the special edition are just extended scenes already in the movie. In some cases this enhances the characters but not by much. Most interesting was the changed ending. I liked the never-seen ending better. The reason it was changed was apparently for believability, but the whole movie was not believable. The picture galleries aren't that good and very short. The special effects commentary could have been better. Most of the interesting information on the special effects was covered very well by the documentaries.

Will Smith, Harry Connick JR., Bill Pullman and a list of others star in the film.
My DVD Review...
WOW, I do not think I have ever seen on a DVD so much stuff. The first disc contains the Theatrical version and the Special edition with over 9 minutes of extra footage.  The second disc contains mucho material. It is everything a DVD collector would want. I just wish a lot of other DVD's would contain the same.
What the Disc contains, but this is just from memory so I will not of listed all of them. An HBO special I think, hosted by Jeff Goldblum the star of the film, Inside ID4, very extensive footage on the making of the buildings, such as the White House, New York buildings and the aliens, that was a really great segment. Also, the spaceships were shown in their irst stages of development, on draft paper and then in the modeling process.
There were ALOT more, I suggest you should really view the DVD's. Even if you do not like the movie, the time and effort put into the second disc is just worth it right there. I would really recommend you see this DVD set and a note on the deleted plane scene to the directors, thank you, thank you! Just kidding.

829309,1,6304233639,"One star?  Even that is more praise than it deserves. I'll ignore the huge gaping holes in the plot, trite cliches, stereotyping and general stupidity that runs through the film to talk about characterisation.  Or, more accurately, the complete lack of it. It would seem that actual acting ability was redundant in this film, and all that was necessary to make it onto the cast list was to have appeared in a previous blockbuster. Will Smith's previous film was 'bad boys', in which he plays a wise-cracking maverick cop.  Here, he is a wise-cracking maverick pilot. Bill Pullman is probably best known for being Meg Ryan's dull, dependable fiance in 'sleepless in seattle'.  guess he'll make a good president then. Jeff Goldblum was a scientist in 'jurassic park', so no surprises here then. (Granted he is actually a chaos mathematician, but hey, that's sort of a scientist, right?) Harvey Fierstien is camp and gay, so no real characterisation is required here then. Brett Spiner plays data in Star Trek.  okay, let's have him dishevelled, but basically the same. Randy Quaid?  Well, he's a bit unstable, so that'll have to do.
Have I missed out on any real character developments?  Don't think so.  Now, if all of this ""short-hand characterisation"" was so that they could really try and strech our imaginations, great.  Unfortunately, it doesn't even try.  I will confess to being almost impressed in the first half hour, with the actual arrival of the alien ships, visually it was impressive.  There were a few deft touches (the ship hovering over Los Angeles, and the widescale panic that ensued, the initial attempts to contact the aliens via 'close encounters...' style music.) and, after all, any film that blows up the white house can't be all bad. It is really just another summer blockbuster.  Let's be honest, they never amount to much anyway. The only positive thing I can think of with regards to this is that the dvd appears to be well appointed.  Hopefully this is a continuing trend.",972172800,8,2001,4.884615384615385

It's a smart, funny, suspenseful, sometimes even scary, and even touching cinematic masterpiece. The story flows nicely and the characters are very human.

Computer imagery at its best.  Some of the computer generated scenes, especially the explosions and the destruction of capital cities is breathtaking.  Worth the price of the DVD alone?  It better be because there's no other reason to buy this movie.
The plot is so simplistic and unplausable that only young children would be able to watch the movie with any kind of suspension of disbelief.  There are plot holes the size of the alien mothership that comes down to destroy the whitehouse.
The acting is mainly average and heavily cliched, Will Smith plays ...Will Smith (can he play any other role?).  Randy Quaid is laughable (for all the wrong reasons) as the stereotypical down-on-his-luck redneck.  Bill Pullman is unconvincing as the president of the US.  Even the excellent Jeff Goldblum cannot save the day.  The script and characters are so awfully cheesey you don't so much sympathise for earth's plight but more so for the aliens.

829370,4,6304233639,"The release of ""Independence Day"" on DVD proved to be a huge  success, and I must say that the treatment this movie has received on this  high-definition video transfer is all that it deserved and more. A  wonderworks of special effects and elements from 50's sci-fi films that  captured people of that generation, Independence Day moved up into the list  of top ten money grossers of all time after its release. While the  storyline remains overall trivial, it does have a certain rush to it in  many cases, especially when things begin to pick up with the invasion. A  typical day in American cities turns into a nightmare when spacecraft the  size of each city begin to blast the cities to nothing but ruin in an  attempt to exterminate the human race. Soon, it's up to a small band of  survivors, including a scientifically-gifted cable repairman (Jeff  Goldblum), an Air Force pilot (Will Smith), a drunken crop duster (Randy  Quaid), and the President (Bill Pullman), to try and figure out a way to  stop the invasion before earth is completely taken over. One thing about  this film: it never stops moving. No matter what scene you're watching, it  is either driven by emotional force or adrenaline action sequences. The  rumors are true as to the special effects as well: they ARE seamless. Using  models and computer effects, Volker Engle and Douglass Smith create images  that fool audiences moreso than any other movie in history. Performances by  all lead and supporting actors make the movie very enjoyable as well as  believable, played out with force, emotion and effort. The DVD release of  the film is superbly crafted: the video resolution displays brilliant  colors and sharp, crisp images that will be very pleasing to the eye. Sound  design immerses the viewer in a non-stop surround environment, utilizing  the rear surrounds as well as the .1 LFE in action scenes and musical  score.

The plot and dialog are a complete  waste of amazing special effects that should have been used toward a movie  with scarier Aliens and more sincere characters.

We've  all seen the ads. The aliens are coming and they're not friendly. They  arrive and they start blowing up the cities and all the people in them.  That's why this movie is playing to sold-out audiences at my local  multiplex. Everybody likes to watch a train wreck; it's a guilty pleasure.  And, so, too, is Independence Day.
The movie opens at Earth's moon,  where the debris of Apollo XI still lingers. Soon, though, it is  overshadowed. Massively. Back on Earth, the TV picture is fuzzy. And, you  have cable. Why? Well, the cable guy knows why. Not that one, but David  Levenson (Jeff Goldblum) who's been peering over a puzzle and suddenly  comes up (for air) with an unpleasant answer. Pretty soon, he's leaving an  overshadowed New York and heading for overshadowed Washington to bring the  bad news to the President (Bill Pullman).  Because Frank's ex-wife is the  President's press secretary, he gets in to see him just in time to get the  President and his staff out of harm's way.
On July 3rd (movie time), the  aliens start blowing things up in a fashion that probably makes Rush  Limbaugh and the militia guys drool.  Down goes the White House, the  Capitol, the Empire State Building, and the First Interstate tower in  downtown L.A.  (Hey, this is what we all came to see, right?)  The rest of  the two and a quarter hour movie is spent figuring out how we're gonna  defeat these blokes from outer space.
Independence Day was intended as a  throwback to the alien and monster pictures of the 50s as well as an homage  to some great sci-fi, disaster and political movies of the ensuing years as  well. So, its not surprising that ID4 evokes memories of movies as varied  as Alien, The War of the Worlds, Dr. Strangelove, Star Trek, and even  Earthquake. As the cast of characters romp from one implausible situation  to another, it all works because the movie is inspired fun.
Speaking of  inspired, there's some good casting here. For comic effect, look to Brent  Spiner, Randy Quaid, Harvey Fierstein, and Judd Hirsch. Vivica A. Fox,  Margaret Colin, and Mary McDonnell do yeoman work as the women behind the  men. Adam Baldwin and Robert Loggia, in roles they could play in their  sleep, are military men. Finally, Will Smith is the fighter pilot who makes  all the right moves.
Kudos to Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the  filmmakers behind ID4. Like Stargate before it, this movie brings together  a lot of disparate elements that you wouldn't expect to find in one film.  It's truly a hoot.
I can't understand the need for some people to try  and compare a film like Independence Day to, say, Sense and Sensibility.  They're two completely different kinds of film. In its genre, Independence  Day is one of the better ones by far.

Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin spent so much time on  special effects and blowing up famous landmarks that they forgot that they  were actually trying to make a movie. Everything is clouded in so much  stupidity that its hard to find this movie entertaining.

But when  I saw it it was a BIG let down for me. The main reason is because  repeatedly throughout the movie things happen that are not only improbable  but impossible. Suspension of disbelief is one thing but every good  writer/director should know that fiction must have some kind of  feasibility. This had none. I could make a long list of things that made no  sense. But my two biggest complaints are these: ONE; why didn't the aliens  just move their hovering 14 mile space ship a little bit higher up in the  atmosphere? At a certain altitude planes cannot fly for lack of air. Since  the aliens obviously did not need air to fly, they could just move a little  higher and the humans would be helpless, END OF STORY. I guess these were  horribly dumb aliens...amazing they managed to develop the technology for  interstellar travel! Number TWO: YOU CANNOT give an alien computer a  computer virus! Anyone who knows anything about computers should know that  a virus is like a computer program, if the machine does not speak the same  language the virus won't work. It would be like trying to destroy your CD  player by putting in a virus infected CD-ROM, it just wouldn't work.  Furthermore, computer viruses of a few years ago cannot damage my computer  because of my anti-virus software.

Oh yeah, Randy Quaid's character was pretty  useless, except until the end. Even then, it was kinda obvious what was  going to happen.

Best to just lay back and let this spectacle roll over you -- if you get  critical, then you miss the fun elements (and there are plenty) and you  might as well ditch this and go watch a Bergman or Woody Allen flick.  It's  big, it's loud, it's stupid, and people love it for exactly the reason that  they love the circus, or fun fair, or roller coasters, or even  Disneyland.
Contrary to another reviewer's comments, the picture quality  is excellent, with superb mastering, a high bitrate, smooth seamless  branching in the special edition, and even a blipless layer switch on my  Toshiba SD1200.  The sound is terrific, with rock-the-house lows and some  marvelous surround work.  The extras, meanwhile, are okay -- disc two is  more so-so than I'd like, but does have some good features.  I would have  liked an isolated score track on that second disc, though -- that was a  highlight of the Patton set.  The Emmerich/Devlin commentary is a hoot,  because neither of them are po-faced about their work, and the irreverence  is refreshing.  The visual effects commentary is quite the opposite -- a  serious and engaging discussion that should be listened to several times by  aspiring VFX techs, wannabe directors, and even screenwriters aiming to  create a blockbuster sci-fi (as opposed to science fiction) event.  In the  real world, as part of a seminar, that second track would cost you serious  money.

As my dad & I left the theater, we  realized we had been enjoying ID4 (the second half, at least) already for  years, when it was WAR OF THE WORLDS, the 50's sci-fi blockbuster by George  Pal.
The real slap in the face is how the movie's directors/writers (who  also brought us the fun monster movie GODZILLA that bore no resemblance  whatsoever to Godzilla in story or appearance; I really did like GODZILLA,  but it was basically a mix of JURASSIC PARK and 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH  with some BEAST FROM 20K FATHOMS thrown in for good measure) didn't even  acknowledge Pal's version during countless interviews. They sited every  science fiction cliche film in the book, but not WAR OF THE WORLDS. The  plot line -- at least from the initial blasting (end of the countdown, when  the aliens unleash the first blasts) -- is almost directly taken from WOTW,  right down to the ""virus"" that defeats the aliens.

We should be able to watch a film and accept it for what it is - being far-fetched shouldn't  mean that you can't sit back, suspend your disbelief for two hours and have  a good time. However, to do that with Independence Day is simply asking too  much of any (semi-)intelligent person.
The start of the film is promising  and from the word go the special effects are awesome and at times  breathtaking. Special effects though do not a movie make and it doesn't  take long for the plot to start to fall apart. The coincidences start early  and continue to mount up with a speed bordering on the insane.... ie, only  guy in the world who deciphers the coded countdown signal (forget NASA and  all the billion dollar Russian and American military spy satellites, this  guy works for a TV station!) just happens to be the 'ex' of the President's  assistant which gets him access, yadda, yadda, yadda.... give me a break!  And of course, that's just the start. I could effortlessly use up all 1,000  words of this review taking the plot's outrageous coincedences  apart.
Other questions.... why would a ship suspend itself over LA... to  crush the militarily important Hollywood movie industry? How come the  governments of the world couldn't work out the Aliens' intentions were  hostile when they'd positioned themselves menacingly over all of the  earth's strategic hotspots and made no effort at all to make contact? When  that 14-mile wide spaceship crashed at the end why didn't flatten the base  below (remember, the one it was hovering over to destroy) and why wasn't  there an earth tremor that went off the richter scale when it's billions  and billions of tons of weight crashed from the sky.... so many questions  and so few answers!
The coincidences are so contrived, as is the  dialogue, and the plot so dreadfully predictable that it becomes an insult  to the intelligence and is simply impossible to enjoy... unless your brain  hurts when you try to think for yourself or you have a mental age of 14 or  below... or if you are 14 or below!
It's all a shame really because the  effects ARE terrific and this movie COULD have been so much more. I love  the sci-fi genre but this is a poor addition to it.
Even if I could have  voted for no stars at all I would still have given it one. The DVD extras  are good and it's only fair to say that. If other films went to as much  trouble then we'd all be a lot happier with our DVDs!

I never did figure out why the alien in area  51 was so quick to announce his clan's intentions rather than lulling the  government into a false sense of security.  Then again why should that  bother me, it's perhaps the smallest hole in the plot.

Each time I watch this my attention moves from Will Smith's performance (especially after seeing  'Wild Wild West') to Jeff Goldblum who deserves an Irving Thalberg career  Oscar for finding so many variants within the role of  ""scientist"". Every Goldblum line reading has something to squirm  about, none of them normal. And then there's his strut at the end that  threatens to knock down Will Smith if he gets too close. Complex. The  bonuses are okay, and there are a lot of them. But really, it's a mediocre  movie, how much into the filmmakers' minds do you want to travel? Many of  the short features repeat footage. The commentary by Devlin & Emmerich  is funny, though. If you're bold enough to consider buying the movie, go  ahead and get this package with the extras and admit only to close friends  that you have become a scholar of a big, bad, fun film.",964483200,,983,4.656976744186046

The image,  sound and fxs are top notch, not to say a landmark for sci fi movies.  Behind all the fireworks involved, you can take a glance at a commited and  masterful craftwork applied with obsessive detail. What's more, the b-movie  aesthetic brought to the final result shows us that the filmakers knew  their audience, did their homework and that they understood that these  flicks should aim for fun before anything, something that George Lucas  couldn't quite achieve in his flawed Phantom Menace. On the other hand, you  could argue some of the decision's taken, like Bill Pullman's miscasting as  President of the U.S. but, nevertheless, it's a very entertaining movie.  But, above all, is because of this dvd special edition, which brings us so  many bonuses, that we feel so good about buying this stuff. All the extras  give added value to the original and help us understand and admire it.

After watching the original bi-plane ending on the Special Edition DVD,  while unbelievable, it made a lot more sense given certain other scenes  within the movie and, again, was fun (which is what this genre is all  about).  The 9 minutes of extra footage also allows for greater character  development and explains more of the story.
However, given the great  special effects, the sound on the DVD is only mediocre - not much bass from  the subwoofer during all the tremendous explosions.  Also, with 2 discs,  too bad they couldn't find room for a Full-Screen version.

The tale starts with a ship roughly 1/4 size of the moon  entering orbit of earth, only to send down multiple city sized ships to our  cities to wipe out humanity.  This is one of those movies where you won't  realize you've spent nearly 3 hours in front of your set.  In fact, you'll  probably want more!
Though this is not one of your ""great  thinker"" movies, it's not really meant to be.  From Dean Devlin  himself (Producer), it's really a ""popcorn movie.""  Sit down, eat  your popcorn, and enjoy the ride.  If you want thought, Amazon.com has 2001  for sale, too.  Nonetheless, this movie still succeeds.  The story is fun  and easy to follow, the characters are believable (and equally fun to  watch!), and the special effects are still (4 years later) among the best  you'll ever see.
This DVD release is great, too, because it gives you  the option to play the theatrical or the special edition versions.  Personally, I like the theatrical better, simply because the editing is  done more smoothly.  The special edition edits sometimes seem a bit rough,  but the scenes are still worth watching.  Also, the movie in DD is a  serious treat!
Supplemental material, you ask?  You got it, and LOTS of  it!  You've got ALL the trailers and TV spots, some cool interviews and  movie specials, and more.  For the price of the disc, you can't beat this  deal.
For sheer fun value, Independence Day sure delivers, and the DVD  transfer (superb color and shadow details, with a pleasing 5.1 surround  mix) is sure to make you thankful for your investment in a player.  This  disc is recommended in every way.",963878400,49,1760,4.630718954248366

The appearance of the alien ships and the firestorm that destroys some of the major U.S. cities are the  highlights of this film -the destruction of the White House is  staggering.
However director Roland Emmerich presents us a true recycled  product of some of the old science-fiction films.  There are shots in this  movie that are almost the same -and sometimes a carbon copy -as ""Star  Wars"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Battlestar  Galactica"", ""Star Trek-The Motion Picture"",  ""Firefox"", and countless others.  Who knows if he was paying a  tribute to those movies?
This special edition DVD presents this movie  with 9 minutes of additional footage.  One interesting thing about this  extra material is that I could finally find the relationship of drunken  pilot Russell Casse with his ""son"" Miguel.  Apart from that,  there is nothing interesting in the extra scenes.

829670,4,6304233639,"Absolutely huge for a short while in the late-90's, this 'War of the Worlds'-esque sci-fi opus gave the world an exploding Empire State building, Bill Pullman as a fighter-jock president, and a second Jeff  Goldblum action figure (to go with the noticeably less-muscular 'Jurassic  Park' version).  It was a watershed in CGI and model effects technology,  and whilst the same director / producer team went on to scupper their  reputation with 'Godzilla' (an awful, empty film that made a huge amount of  money), the unsequelised 'ID4' still seems much as it did in 1995. It was  and remains utterly, utterly brainless, but huge fun, and now it's out on  DVD. It hasn't dated too badly - whilst the exploding buildings and rushing  crowds seem obviously faked, the surprisingly-sparce dogfighting footage  still looks top-notch, and the alien vessels still seem extremely  impressive. The acting is unimportant, and the fact that, after the initial  attack, not much happens for the middle hour notwithstanding, it's  old-school mass-entertainment of a type not seen since the mid-70's  disaster movie genre.
There's a fantastic amount of extra bits on this  DVD, and along with 'The Matrix' this is a model of how to do this kind of  thing - there's an alternative ending, one which makes you glad that they  ditched it, some extra 'special edition' sequences, two 'Making of'  documentaries, an amusing 'Blair Witch' / Orson Welles-esque fake news  documentary on the alien menace, and some interesting commentaries.

There  is also an alternate ending.  I'm sure most people have seen the movie -  but just in case here's the quick lowdown.  Alien battleships strategically  position themselves around the world.

There are 2 chapters that are the same scene. One of  them is supposed to be one of the added scenes.

The stock ""Alien invasion"" and ""The average Joes save the  day"" storylines are used to full effect in this one. But for some reason I  rather enjoy viewing this neat little epic. And to this day, I've yet to  view a movie that boasts more realistic visual effects than this effort  (although many of the rear-projection screen shots could've been  better).
Howzabout them buildings? They blew up REAL good, huh huh. And  let's face it... with all the gripes we have about our government, is there  any adult Yank viewer who doesn't feel just a tiny bit of morbid  satisfaction along with the horror after seeing the U.S. Capitol building  or the White House go up in flames, even if only in fiction? Actually,  there's probably a lot of non-American viewers who find it pretty amusing  too. Not to be outdone of course, New York and L.A. also receive some quick  ""urban renewal"", both just as spectacularly as the D.C. blowout.
A good  portion of the restored Special Edition footage helps to further flesh out  the subplot involving Randy Quaid's character, who plays the stereotypical  ""ne'er-do-well who redeems himself in the end"" character. Most of  the remaining added bits are extensions of scenes, rather than entire  scenes themselves. If you are a more casual viewer of ID4, a few of these  added bits might pass you by with little notice.
Although not as  extensively equipped as ""The Abyss"" Special Edition DVD, 20th Century Fox  did throw in quite a few extra features on Disc Two, including theatrical  trailers, TV spots, production stills, and a few ""making-of""  documentaries. There's also a DVD-ROM game that I don't presently have the  technology to try out...
But out of all the extras given, I find the most  entertaining part to be the original ending, which is laughably hokey...  well, more hokey than many of the other moments in the movie anyway. All  I'm going to say is you'll have to see it to believe it...

This movie makes references (and perhaps  pays the ""multi-million dollar"" homage) to the themes of some of  the classic Hollywood sci-fi flicks over the past 50-odd years.  First, you  have the city scaled, massive spacecraft hovering over major cities...can  anyone remember the 1982 TV series ""V"" which also borrowed that  theme from classic 50's sci-fi flicks as well?  I mean, the giant  sun-blocking spacecraft hovering overhead is as old as science fiction, yet  it still impresses the hell out of us when we see it.  The ending scenes  with Goldblum and his laptop inputting a computer virus in to the  mothership: an obvious borrowing from ""War of the Worlds"" but  instead of the virus being biological it was technological.  The aliens  themselves ""consuming every natural resource and then moving on"":  the Borg on Star Trek, The Next Generation.  There are other subtle  references in the movie as well.  Throw in a good mix of underdog, regular  Joe characters that have to come together to save humanity and you've got  classic sci-fi on your hands.
Unfortunately, Europeans need not apply  in seeing this flick as many of them (once again) deplore the lack of any  other nationalities getting much air time and wait while the Americans do  all the work.  This is purely an American flick.  Sorry.
In short, it's  classic sci-fi done in a modern setting and I'm sure the formula will still  prevail 30 years from now when another movie is made in a very similar  vein, using very similar concepts involving Hollywood sci-fi that have been  around since printed film was invented.

No.  Although this 2 disc DVD set is soo full of  content, does the special edition really make this spectacular movie any  greater?  Not really.

It really is wierd that I still get pretty sad when I  watch the scene when the president learns that his wife is dying and his  daughter asks if she is sleeping now.

Having purchased the awesome ABYSS 2-disc pack, and  having purchased the BLADE DVD (and I think the BLADE DVD extras still blow  all other extras away), the amount of material on this was disappointing.  I mean, the ABYSS DVD had the ENTIRE MOVIE in storyboards, plus the entire  original shooting script.  Why couldn't we get that here?  Instead, we get  3 scenes storyboarded, and NO script.  We get three making of specials, one  of which is cool ... but by the third one, it all seems so redundant!

The sound is mixed oddly.  When something blows up, or jets  fly, the sound is QUIETER than when people are talking.  These effects  should be louder.  If you turn up your system to hear the effects the way  you would like to, the next scene in which people are just talking ends up  being way too loud.  I guess the movie was mixed this way to prevent TV  speakers from popping, but I have a mid-to-high-end system, and this just  really bites.  I was so disgusted with the sound that I turned off the  movie, and will be returning the DVD to Best Buy for a refund (hopefully).  I observed this same effect on the movie Event Horizon",962323200,3,791,4.25
829919,5,6304233639,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. I think the acting is excepional, and the special effects are spectacular.
Most of the complaints this movie gets, I belive are undeserved. People who criticize  this movie tell people to leave their IQ at home... Maybe they should have  brought their IQ along to understand the movie!
First the people who  complain that the movie is too much focused on America.... WTF?  Can you  please tell me what the name of the movie is?  Indepenence Day (ID4) an  american holliday! c'mon get a clue, of course it is going to be biased in  favor of america, it is only the most important American Holiday!
another  problem people have with the move is that the acting is horrible... well I  won't touch much on that one since that is subject to opinon... all Ill say  is watch it again... the DVD version has more of the Story intact... and  watch the part where the ""firt kid"" says ""is mommy  sleeping"" and the pres says ""yeah... mommys sleeping"" and  tell me you don't feel anything....
the other problem people have a hard  time with is the part, or parts i should say; where Jeff Goldblum  is able  to dicipher the alien code in the satilite and where he can connect to the  alien ship with his laptop...
first... the alien ships where using human  satilites, where everything is in binary(how all our compuers are  Binary)... and Jeff Being a 8 year MIT Grad probably has a good  understanding of reading binary... and all he did was find a hidden binary  code that wasn't supposed to be there, he filtered it out and realized that  it was a count down(in short).
the one that most people have a problem  with is when he interfaces with the alien ship using his laptop.... well  think about it! they have had an alein ship there to study for 30+ years...  how do you think they were studing the alien technology?with computers!  Im sure they developed some sort of interface adapter to the alien  technology that allowed our computers to interface with alien computers...  what, you want them to show you how they make it so you know it works and  then you can say this is a beliveable movie?  C'mon guys Use your IQ you  have so much of, take it to the movie next time, im sure youll like it the  movie much more.
the only issue with the movie are the shortcuts it  takes... like when will smith finds his girlfriend among the rubble of EL  Toro, or when he finds Area 51 with the RV caravan. or how Wills girlfriend  finds the first lady, or how Jeff's girl friend is in a position to get a  meeting with the president So Jeff can Give the critical info to the pres  just in time... but all that is to just make the movie more fun. thats all  the movie tries to be... just a Kick A$$ joy ride!

829921,5,6304233639,"""ID4"" is a movie that people are either going to love or hate. I  personally LOVE this movie. The acting and special effects are top notch,  there is a plot, not much of one but there is one and no people, this is  NOT a remake of The War of the Worlds. I have read some of the reviews on  here and frankly, I can accept people's reasons why they hate this movie,  but some of them are lame. Like one reviewer mentioning about the swaying  palm trees after the nuclear fire or the fact that Jeff Goldblum's  character can access the alien mothership with a laptop. It's only a movie!  This movie wasn't made to be analyzed for it's flaws. It was made for fun!  Anyway, the plot has alien beings invading the Earth in 15-mile wide  spaceships that hover over important cities and soon, they destroy them and  plan to take over the world and wipe us out. A small band of survivors must  band together to stop them before it's too late. Plain and simple. Nothing  complicated. The special effects are awesome. Shots of the First Interstate  Tower, Empire State Building and White House being blown apart are  spectacular and very realistic. The firestorm that occurs afterwards is  also fantastic. There is also plenty of action as F-15 jets and alien  crafts engage in a huge air battle with missles flying and explosions  happening.

829922,5,6304233639,"The word ""entertainment"" derives from the Greek work ""entrata"" which means ""to hold"" i.e., one's attention.  Independence Day certainly succeeds in that regard.  Some have criticized  this movie for being shallow, but did anyone honestly enter the theater or  rent the video expecting King Lear?
The story has been done before, true,  but never as spectacularly as it is here.  The acting is fine, without  overshadowing the story, particularly from Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, and  Brent Spiner in a scene stealing supporting role.
Since most will have  already seen the movie, I'll address this DVD issue.  Picture transfer and  sound are of demonstration quality.  The movie comes with a French  soundtrack.  However, the added footage in the special edition is not  dubbed into French, so  subtitles have been provided for these scenes.  The  commentary track by Devlin and Emmerich was recorded two years ago for a  laserdisc issue and appears again here.  The other track by the special  effects team was created for the DVD edition and gives much useful  information for special effects enthusiasts.
The movie is still superior  in the theatrical edition.  The added footage is of passing interest, but  really feels like padding.
The second disc is crammed with extras  including various theatrical and television trailers, a documentary about  the special effects, and an amusing ""mockumentary"" about the  invasion.
A must have DVD for popcorn movie enthusiasts.",962236800,3,1472,5.282608695652174

The picture is beautiful and the THX sound is what it should have been in the theatre! Whether or not you enjoyed this film, this DVD edition is well worth the money. It is filled with lots of cool behind the scenes documentaries, including the Fox special wich aired just prior to the films release. I highly recommend this DVD special edition to any and everyone!  The film itself may not be that spectacular when examined closely, but this is still a very nice DVD set to own!

The supplimental disk has an  excellent menu of the Area 51 hanger and includes 3 documentaries, and  plenty of trailers. It would have been nice to see some storyboards,  production art, merchandise, or even some UFO stuff but it's still cool.

The 5.1 mix is okay, the THX encoding helps, but the ""low effects"" during the big explosions (e.g. ""The White  House"") lack earth-shaking feel. I heard more bass resonance from the  Eagles - ""Hell Freezes Over - DTS."" True fans of ID4 will not be  disappointed, but with so much on these disks, DTS encoding would have  rocked. The surround effects are still present, but are not reached to  their fullest potential for a movie of this type. The special edition is a  value, but ID4 falls short of being the DVD that you want to astound your  friends with when you show off your system, primarily due to  ""average"" sound editing.",962236800,,722,4.5
829989,3,6304233639,"ID4 was a fun event movie.  A popcorn-muncher roller coaster kind of film.  Not one that anyone should bother with thinking about too deeply.  It is the cinematic equivalent of going on a ride at a carnival.  Lots of show,  but not too much else.  That being said, what is interesting is how many  people have had such strong differing responses to this movie.  I've read  several reviews condemning the film for Racial stereotypes, particularly  Will Smith & Judd Hirsch.  And yet in Israel the movie was praised for  these exact same portrayals -- ""Here we have a movie in which a Black  man and a Jewish man save the world.""  In other nations of the  Mid-East the film was condemned for that very same reason -- ""Only in  America would they dare to make a movie where a Black man and a Jewish man  save the world.""  Several of those countries cut out as much of the  Judaism elements as possible. Another bit of irony is the pro-smoking  message in the movie.  Cigars are regarded as a ""victory dance.""  This is ironic because in Dean Devlin & Roland Emmerich's previous  feature, ""Stargate,"" cigarettes are equated with death. Other  bits of criticism seem unfair.  In one of the reviews above, for example,  the critic mentions how Will Smith just happened upon his girlfriend in the  ruins of L.A.  He missed the part where Smith told her he would meet her at  the Air Force Base.  The film shows her and a few other survivor going to  the base, which was also destroyed.  But Smith did know to go there &  look. I still would like to know how Hirsch & Jeff Goldblum managed to  drive from New York to D.C. in 5 hours, however. One great extra on the DVD  is the alternate ending footage where Randy Quaid flies his Bi-Plane into  battle against the Alien ship.  The directors cut it because, among other  reasons, they felt the sight of an old, outmoded plane flying among  sophisticated F-18s & the alien fighters would be just too silly.  An  odd thought considering the rest of the film.  I did, however, agree with  the other reasons for changing it.  I just wish they could have come to a  decent compromise to keep that bi-plane in. I would also like to add, as  much as I enjoyed this movie on DVD, the one I am really looking forward to  is JAWS!  Now there is a great Popcorn movie!",962236800,,2298,4.424096385542168
829990,5,6304233639,"I watch and read science fiction for the fun of it.  There is good sci-fi (based on sound scientific principles), and there's escapist sci-fi/fantasy (like Independence Day).  While I am trained in the sciences myself, I  enjoy the occasional side trip to escapist worlds and stories.  It doesn't  all have to make scientific sense for me all the time.  OK, back to the  show...
If you have been off-planet or in a bomb shelter for the past  four years and haven't had a chance to watch this show, here's the scoop.  Military intelligence spots an incoming alien mother ship that releases  several smaller satellite ships that take up station over key world cities.  In the meantime, no one knows what to do or what to expect.  In true  Hollywood fashion, the only one who catches on to what is happening is the  least likely person around -- a cable TV company techno-guru, who's former  wife happens to be the President's press secretary.  Well, Earth takes a  beating before things come together for the underdog earthlings, but it all  turns out for the best in the end.
That sounds kind of snippy doesn't it!  On the other hand, this film is amazing!  There is tactile suspense, good  character development, a great assemblage of talented actors (though Dr.  Okin at Area 51 is not all that believable), and great visual candy.  The  special effects make this movie a great one to see.
Sure there are gaping  holes in the story.  Sure there are silly scientific oversights.  Sure  there is a formulaic story underlying the whole affair, but, so what?  It's  great fun.  Smith, Pullman, Goldblum and friends put on a great show.
5  stars for the fun of it.  Totally watchable!  Give it a try.  Good action,  good fun.

The ends of some scenes are almost cut off, and there is a point when they  have a shot of Air Force One and the thing just pauses for a second --  unacceptable!

Yes, there are gaping holes in the plot and science.  Chief amongst them is the  connection between Jeff Goldblum's computer and the mother ship.  We can't  usually connect two Earth laptops on the same platform.  And assuming Jeff  could connect with the alien network don't you think they'd have Norton  Antivirus 3000?

First off, I really love this movie to begin with, so this  set is for any ID4 fan. On disc one there is a special edition of this  movie with about 9 minutes of additional footage, although it actually  seems like a lot less. Nothing major added, just some addition to add to  the scene development. It also has the original theatrical release on disc  one if you want to watch that. The second disc is packed with suppliments.  My favorite was seeing an alternate ending using the biplane, it was quite  funny and i'm a little surprised they didn't stick with that one. There is  also a neat hidden easter egg on this disc which most people will likely  miss. Goto the Data Console, then highlight main menu, then press the right  arrow key to highlight the red LED on the computer and press enter. The  spaceship in the background will start to move, once it lets you, quickly  go back to the main menu and press 7 then 4 and enter and it will kick you  inside the ship where it has a lot of cool extra features.

I'm sure I'm not the only person who was a bit touched by the scene with the President and his wife.  Or moved  by his Independence Day speech.  Jeff Golblum, as always, is an  entertaining presence in the movie.  His unique style speaks for itself and  works extremely well in this movie.  Will Smith, love him or hate him,  brings all his energy to his role as Capt. Steven Hiller.  Personally, I  thought the cast was perfect for the movie.  Sure, there's no Oscars here,  but that's not the point of the movie.
As we all know, the special  effects where great, but despite some complaints that that's what all this  movie is about, I liked the story, too.  Simple and to the point.  Aliens  come.  Aliens virtually blow up our planet.  We fight back.  What makes the  movie good is that the simple story is presented in a way in which has you  rooting for the good guys at the end of the movie, and that's all that  counts.
As for the DVD special extras, well, it has some pretty neat  stuff.  Trailers galore, behind the scenes features, the original  ""Biplane ending"", which they made a wise choice in changing.  Just a little too much cheese, even for this movie.  You get to hear Devlin  give his reasons for cutting it, which are good ones.  Also, the sound was  awesome in my system.
Of paticular interest to me was the fact that it  had two versions of the film, one the regular and the other, a special  edition with nine minutes of footage cut from the original version.  Pretty  much, most of these scenes don't add too much to the movie, but they are  nice to see.  My fave new scenes where the ones with Russel and his sick  kid and the one with Jeff Golblum and Brent Spiner in the cockpit of the  alien craft.  Those were nice touches in my opinion.

 First, I am a self-professed fan of  Jeff Goldblum and have been since 1984's `Into the Night'. As always,  Goldblum seems to be in an entirely different movie than the one you  watching, and you wish you watching the other film instead. Second, I like  Will Smith, but I guess that's due to the fact that I think I have seen  every episode of Fresh Prince ever aired. I really like Smith's stripper  girl friend, played by Vivica Fox and mourn the fact that the film only had  a PG-13 rating. So, on to the plot (the author takes five minutes to  recover from his laughing fit).
 Aliens show up to Earth and dispatch  dozens of city-sized saucers down to the planet and they hover menacingly  over the major cities of the world. It is very nice to note, however, that  they completely ignore Canada, and when they finally turn Washington DC,  New York, LA, Moscow, etc. into craters, guess who's in charge, boys!  You'll be eating beaver tails and drinking Canadian beer before you can say  `Tom Green'! Anyway, Goldblum discovers that the aliens are using a binary  signal to transmit around the globe to synchronize their attack. He decides  he has to get his dad, (Judd Hirsch), and drive to DC and save his wife  and, oh, maybe warn the President (Bill Pullman), so he can tell the rest  of the US to panic.
 We then meet Marine Captain Stephen Hiller (Will  Smith) and his girlfriend, Jasmine (Vivica Fox) who live in LA and who also  have an alien ship hovering above their city. This would be a bad idea  under any circumstance given the total whack jobs that live in that town.  Hiller gets called back to his base and asks Jasmine to join him there  later, ensuring that she will not be turned into a charcoal brickette when  the evil aliens attack. Well, the aliens do attack, embarking on a urban  renewal campaign by leveling New York, LA, and Washington. It is at this  point that they should have rolled the credits, because races that can do  that sort of thing do not, repeat, DO NOT get defeated by primitive screw  heads like us.
 Nor do they get defeated by Mackintosh Power Books,  even if it is used by Jeff Goldblum. This movie makes leaps in logic that  would confound Oppenheimer. Cable TV station managers can write computer  viruses that cause the alien ships to drop their shields thereby rendering  them susceptible to missile attacks, US Marine Core pilots can fly alien  spacecraft, and very quickly this film becomes fantasy. However, all of  that aside, it is one heck of a good romp and has its fair share of laughs.  Sure the story is plot holes big enough to drive a very large starship  through, but I expect that sort of thing from Emmerich and Devlin. It does  entertain, has great special effects and a terrific musical score by David  Arnold, so I can forgive a story that could have been written by any five  year old.",961632000,2,3186,4.567375886524823
830064,3,6304233639,"Let's face it...""Independence Day"" is about as mindless an entertainment as you can get, but it IS entertainment, and it works beautifully on that level.
""Independence Day"" is like a 1970's  disaster flick with $50 million in F/X. Things get blowed up real good  indeed...so good, in fact, that the movie loses a LOT of steam after things  stop getting blowed up.
Still, ""Independence Day"" is a lot of  fun, and features some funny performances (especially Will Smith, who  actually trash-talks one of the alien invaders as he drags him across the  desert).
But the point of this movie IS watching things get blowed up  real good.
And that it does well.",961459200,2,653,4.776785714285714
830065,2,6304233639,"Well, it is challenging to raise a negative voice against such a  ""cult"" movie, but I can't restrain myself. I have watched it in  1997 and still it remains one of the worst big screen blockbusters I've  ever seen (although I LOVE to watch blockbusters and sci-fi and actions  movies especially). The plot is universally known and can fit within 3  lines, the movie is full of tarnished cliches (slimy octopus-like aliens  who I don't know how can operate their flying sources, brave and courageous  pilots and soldiers in general, but usually unhappy in family life or  ""whose wife is just to give birth to a baby"", a very cute and  young President with a dying old wife) and cheep pathos and sickly sweet  patriotism. The famouse scene of a giant UFO demolishing the White House  and surroundings is good, but when Mr President is informed that several  million people perished and he even does not blank a tear ... I think you  missed a good scene here.  It is also a pity to watch good actors  performing in such rubbish (got some good dough though, no doubt).
The  theme of aliens conquering Earth and after initial success receive a good  kick in the a.... from humans is eternal and it raises our self-esteem, but  I'd like to ask the guys making these movies - respect the audience, not  all of us have such bad taste or no taste at all or are kids under 12. One  of my friends, an American, said: ""When watching this movie, during  first hour I was proud that I'm American, after it finished - I was ashamed  that we've produced such a movie...""

Big, loud, and VERY dumb, Independence Day does have some  pretty cool aliens and some decent spfx scenes.  However, it has so many  lame one-liners that we are left to ponder whether we are watching a sci-fi  flick or Amateur Night At the Apollo.  Good actors are wasted in roles that  are sketchy and cliched at best.  The score is pretty bad as well; all  noise and no emotion. Its sad to see so much money wasted on something so  lousy. Perhaps films like this exist solely to entertain.  Maybe the  critics should just lighten up, shut off their brains and enjoy.  But, then  again, maybe we, as an audience, should stop pouring our time and cash into  movies that are slapped together without a trace of thought or creativity.

830090,4,6304233639,"So give us all a break!  To all the self-proclaimed elitist snobs. Lets try to remember that is the reason why movies like Independence Day are made, to escape from our dower everyday lives and thats why we flock to see  them. Yes, the United States is made to look like the world savior, but how  far is that really from the truth? Arent we called upon all the time to  save the world from itself? If the plot of this movie were to really happen  the united nations would roll over and beg for us to save them! Yes it is a  feel good about being American movie and so it should be we were riding the  high from our victory in the Persian Gulf and a resurgence of patriotism  and this movie capitolized on this in spades it was meant to make you want  to stand up and sing ""proud to be an American"" at the end of the  movie. I think that the other nations peoples may just see this for what it  is and may make them get the message that its better to join us than fight  us anymore. And wasn't anyone watching the part of the movie were it said  that the president was an ex-fighter pilot Gulf War hero, so with pilots at  a shortage then wouldnt Pullman get in the cockpit once again? After all  once a fighter jock always a fighter jock! And though it didn't explain it  the more I let go of my cinisism of the Smith finding his girlfriend scene,  it led me to think well she did go to El Toro marine air station and maybe  he checked elsewhere and figured maybe she went there in such an emergency,  my wife would go to our air base where I am stationed in such a situation  and what military spouse would not? All in all its a decent movie with some  good humour and great special effects and the video transfer onto digital  is superbly done, the sound in 5.1 will give a great workout to all our  expensive surround systems and isn't that what they are bought for. Plus  there are some great extras I just wish more releases had this much stuff  on them, maybe someday hollywood will start to make more movies that  completly utilize the advantages of DVD, like multi camera angles and such.  Go on and buy this you won't be dissapointed and if you are well maybe you  should stick with documentaries and nature specials.",960681600,12,2227,4.200945626477542
830091,3,6304233639,"The first time I saw ID4 I hated it, but that's because I don't like  having to suspend my belief in the laws of physics while watching an action  movie (Bugs Bunny doesn't count). There are so many over-the-top stunts and  inane plot twists that I couldn't get into the rhythm of the movie.
The  second time I watched this movie I already knew that it was stupid and I  hated it, so I just sat back and watched the eye candy... And you know  what.. I had a good time.
If you can calculate a 15% tip without a  calculator, check your brain at the door and disregard the flaws in  computer science, political theory, fluid dynamics, and everything else and  you'll probably enjoy this movie.

And  then we come to the blatant Star Wars rip-off of an ending.  I sat in the  theatre and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was only missing a  bearded bloke saying ""You'll be required to pilot your fighters down  this trench and skim the surface to this point"".

I like to think I'm a fairly enlightened  movie-watcher, and fully realize the plot and acting aren't Oscar material  (The FX's are though!), but it's still fun, and has a sprawling, epic feel  that's very rare in todays movies.

It's an action  blockbuster in its purest form.  MOVIES ARE MEANT TO ENTERTAIN, that  doesn't mean they have to have deeply written scripts like ""Blade  Runner"", or ""2001"" (is that a rule or something, I don't  think so) they just have to entertain, and that's what this movie does,  with flying colors.

Unfortunately, special effects hardly impress this reviewer.  Will Smith is somewhat likeable in  this film and Judd Hersch is funny (although he could never top his work in  Taxi).  The prospect of a Bill Pullman presidential administration is more  frightening than the thought of aliens attacking the earth.  If a guy as  cheesy and pathetic as Pullman ever got elected, I would pray for an alien  attack.  Pullman's speech to the pilots before they conquer the aliens is  both laim and sad.  As always, Jeff Goldblum is just awkwardly unfunny  enough to make anyone with any type of standards want to lose his lunch.  There are some hot chicks in this movie, which would have been helped a  little if these chicks had appeared wearing less clothing.  This is  certainly not the worst special effects movie ever made, but it does little  to detract from the minority opinion that special effects are usually used  as a substitute for plot.",959212800,4,1067,4.6702702702702705

The dialogue is laugh-out-loud terrible, the story  line is implausible, and the acting (or should I say  ""over-acting"") is generally atrocious.

830158,4,6304233639,"This is not a great movie, and it isn't as impressive on video as in the theater, but it works on a number of levels. I saw a packed house applaud this film twice and I think I know a reason why.
Hidden in all the  stupidity (although there are some incredibly well done scenes-- the alien  arrival; the first battle) is a story about a bunch of underachievers  shaking off their problems and saving the day.  You have a President  failing in the polls (Pullman), a fighter pilot (Smith) who repeatedly  fails to make the astronaut corps; an alcoholic Vietnam era fighter  jock(Quaid) who can't do a crop dusting job right; a stripper (nothing  against strippers) who manages to save her family and her dog during the  alien launched holocaust. It's no wonder so many people wanted to see the  aliens lose -- in many ways this movie is about overcoming obstacles.
This movie also makes real everyone's ultimate fantasy of super aliens  taking on a super power -- probably why the blowing up of the White House  caused such a reaction -- seeing that, you know the battle's on.
The  message of everyone working together is somewhat lost in the jingoism of  the film, but seeing an Arab/Israeli pilot team  kind of brings home the  message.  It is a silly movie, but at its heart it connects with people's  optimism.  Most movies today are more cynical, so it's interesting that  this one works.  Enjoy it.
Also, much has been said about the inability  of the laptop to connect with the alien ship-- Goldblum discovers the  alien's use of our satellite system -- according to the movie they had  already made THEIR system compatible to ours.

Yet when i see a movie like this i try to avoid  thinking about those because this movie is meant soley to entertain. And at  that i feel it excels greatly. It is full of great special effects and some  nice action sequences and of course really big explosions. I feel that when  you watch a movie you have to put it in its genre and rate it accordingly.  Therefore you can not expect much from a movie like ID4. And above all this  was a kids movie so of course the directors could do things like have plot  holes because they knew there target audience wouldnt mind because they  would be too caught up in the special effects. I say it did what it was  meant to do. but if you're looking for a GOOD science fiction movie pass on  this one and rent the original star wars  or V,951436800,,1015,4.148717948717949

830198,2,6304233639,"Independence Day is one of those films people like to praise or criticize. Here is why I think the film is so dumb.
An exciting thing has happened. We find out we are not the only form of life in the universe. A fleet of  ships have come to Earth, hovering over all the major cities of the  world.
After a seemingly endless wait, the ships fire beams of energy,  destroying all the famous landmarks and symbols of patriotism. There is  much destruction, chaos and carnage as cities are razed to the ground. All  this was shown in the previews and this is what sold the tickets. This  really says a lot about human nature and our appetite for destruction.  Shame on us! Aliens have probably never made contact because they're so  scared of our war-like ways.
If aliens have technology advanced enough  to cross so many light years, that would suggest very sophisticated mental  ability. Surely then, aliens would be beyond things like warfare, conquest  or subjugation? If they wanted to take over another planet couldn't they  have chosen one closer to home? There must be millions of planets in the  universe, so why Earth? Why attack us? At least H.G. Wells' Martians had a  logical reason for moving in on Earth. Our planet was closest, and they  were desperate.
It's a lucky coincidence that the aliens built their  fighter craft in such a way that humans would be able to handle the  controls. An ""old"" craft that has been hidden by the US  government for several years is uncovered. It was linked to Roswell. Two  men (played by Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum) somehow learn to pilot the  craft and fly it to the mother ship out in space. One lucky thing about the  alien attackers is that they never upgrade the model of their fighter  craft. If they did the craft Smith and Goldblum flew would be as  conspicuous as the Red Baron's plane among a squadron of B-29s.
I don't  think it's fair to blame the actors for this film being bad. It's the corny  dialogue. When I saw the preview for this film I thought it was supposed to  be serious and frightening.

It was an O.K. adventure that should have been quite a bit  better. I don't put it in the league of ""War of the Worlds"" or  ""The Day The Earth Stood Still.""",935798400,,386,4.632352941176471
830275,4,6304233639,"If you take this film seriously, you'll be seriously disappointed.  It's just a bit of wacky fun  Don't expect it to make you feel, don't expect it to make you think - just laugh at the actors hamming it up next to some  pretty decent FX.  Overly flag waving, IMHO, but still fun.",934156800,,280,4.226415094339623
830276,5,6304233639,"I went to go see ID4 on July 4th, 1996. It  enhanced the experience the whole way.  ID4 was never meant to be taken  philosophically or literally. The whole point of  the movie was to be entertained, and it is  one  movie you can watch when you are bored  with everyday life and you  want something to  excite you and give you a real adrenalin rush.  ID4 was  a feel good movie. That is all it really  was. It made you want to scream,  ""We sure  kicked some Alien Butt."" It was refreshing to  see a  different perspective on the theme, ""man  vs. man, man vs. machine, or  man vs, nature.""  It was ""Man vs. Alien."" It is not to be  compared  to other sci-fi films, for it pretty much stands on  it's own.  You have an army of men fighting an  army of aliens. That is something you  don't see  everyday!  Although, it was a remake of H.G. Well's ""War  of The Worlds,"" I believe the writers of the  show were intending to  make it fun and  entertaining, and not deep and profound as it's  predecessor. Compare ""The Fly,"" 1958 to ""The  Fly,""  1986. The remake was by far different  and was deep and profound, unlike  it's own  predecessor, but is considered a great or better  movie than it's  original version.  Cheers!

830277,2,6304233639,"This movie, for me, was a disapointment. Good special effects, yes, but that only goes so far. This was also some sort of send-up of sci-fi movies of the past, but they played it so straight-faced the actors come off  looking more like cliches than anything else. The dialogue was laughable  and you knew what was going to happen before it did. ""Mars  Attacks"" is a way better movie to me because they went all the way  with the camp humor and sci-fi references and it came out as it should be:  a lot of fun. This movie tried that, but it also tried to be dramatic at  the same time, so it failed at both.",931564800,2,606,4.181034482758621

830279,5,6304233639,"Independence Day was so much better than the critics said it was.  In my mind, Independence Day was very good.  The alien attack showed how people will work together in a tense situation, even if they don't want to.  Besides that, there were many relationships to see and how they changed.  The flight scenes were incredibly done, the alien autopsy was cool, and the acting was awesome.  All around, Independence Day is worth buying and seeing many times.",929836800,,455,4.782051282051282
830312,4,6304233639,After getting a front row seat in a jam-packed theater one night in July of 1996 was one thing but to see amazingly shattering effects wipe out half the world was another. No doubt the star here are the Oscar-winning  effects. It was a blast to see for the first time but even the shine on  this one wears away with each viewing. Some parts of the story sound  totally oddball but carry the film just enough to hold our interest. I  loved it. Being a fan of the sci-fi films of the 1950's helps a lot...,924220800,,503,4.154639175257732

This is my absolute favorite movie. I just wish they would  have left out at least most of the swear words. My parents won't let me own  it because of all the swear words. I think it's an awesome movie despite  the language. If you can forgive yourself for listening to garbage language  then this is a must see!!!!!!",923529600,,479,4.173913043478261
