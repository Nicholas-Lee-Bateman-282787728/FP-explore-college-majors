7788397,5,0760113858,Always a favorite.  Glad to find a copy for a child in church that just loves this video.,1465257600,,89,3.9444444444444446
7788398,5,0760113858,"I actually bought this copy for my nephew.  My daughter has a copy and my nephew wants to watch it over and over and over.  Both of them, ages 2 and 3, LOVE this VHS production of Tommy.  Tommy's Treehouse is Christian based and tells stories of how God created Earth and the moon, the creation of the people, Jonah and the Whale, and many others.  All the children I know give this tape 2 thumbs up.  As far as adults, it can be somewhat annoying, but no more than Elmo, SpongeBob, and others.",1169078400,,494,4.212765957446808
