7000428,5,B00T5D4M2U,best vamp show on cable.,1437955200,2,24,4.0
7000429,4,B00T5D4M2U,"I very much enjoyed this season of the originals and I am looking forward for more.  The world of the show has expanded greatly, and we see a return of all of the deceased members of the Mikelson family along with family we didn't know existed.  Each reborn member of the family causes their own sources of conflict, good and bad, and family dynamics change going forward.  I won't lie not every character survivors, and some deaths will change the family forever.

The biggest change this year is Klaus.  Last season saw him become not quite so brutal, and a little less a villain whilw awaiting the birth of and trying to protect his daughter.  This season we see the Klaus of old.  Willing to do anything to anyone, friend family or foe, who stand in the way of his agenda.  Even though most of this was done for the main intent of protecting his daughter and not just for his own selfish reasons, there are some things he did that might not be forgiven.

My only complaint about this season is that some of the story arcs tended to drag, and the season at times moved very slow.  I would have like to see more episodes in the middle that kept the story going instead of this happening at the end of the season, where some may have gotten bored and stopped watching.

I am anxious to see what happens next and the fallout for the family after Klaus' actions.  Will they all still believe in Always and Forever, or has that been broken for the final time.",1433635200,8,1457,4.37546468401487
7000430,4,B00T5D4M2U,"Pretty good season overall. I thought there was creativity in the villains this season. My only complaint was the body-jumping, causing some of the characters (Rebekah, Kol, Esther, Finn) to not be in a good chunk of the season. I missed seeing the real actors. Interesting, emotional end to the season.. Excited for season 3!",1432857600,4,326,4.945454545454545
7000431,5,B00T5D4M2U,I love this show! It's amazing and it leaves the viewers craving more. Joseph Morgan is fantastic as Klaus and he really brings life to the show as does the rest of the cast. You really find yourself pulling for the characters and hoping it works out for them and typically when they die you find yourself screaming at the TV and you'll be jumping for joy when you see some old-well not old but well you'll see- faces again. Really though The Originals is about family and that's what makes it good.,1431302400,4,499,4.376344086021505

Lol Of course I had to finally get this DVD because no one needs an incomplete series collection. Now I already had to get over Klaus killing Davina's school crush, but then that evil witch Dahila goes and rips out Davina's bestie Josh' boyfriend Aden's heart.

7000514,4,B00T5D4M2U,"I absolutely loved The Vampire Diaries and thought that I would also enjoy The Originals.  I did not enjoy Season One, but thought that I would give the show another chance.  Unfortunately, Season Two has been as equally disappointing.  The storyline does not have much substance and dynamic.  Aside from the original characters from The Vampire Diaries, which are clearly top notch the new actors for this show are seemingly inexperienced and unattractive.  The storyline is very boring and uninspiring. What are they really fighting for?  Their city?  As a viewer I am not sensing the characters really love their city or care much about what they are fighting for.  This show should be discontinued and the Michealson's should return to the Vampire Diaries along with Nina Dobrev! I will not be viewing a Season Three if the show does in fact not get cancelled!

Perhaps I spoke too soon.  The show took a miraculous turn about half way through and I am actually really enjoying it!  I will watch Season Three.",1455408000,,1013,4.8313953488372094

Claudia Black  as  this  season's villian  is  freaking awesome! I  loved  this character  so much  that  i was  pissed  that  they  killed  her  off.  Season  2  is  awesome  hopefully  season  3 will  take notes.",1446854400,,385,4.896551724137931
