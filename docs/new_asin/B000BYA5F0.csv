8094141,4,B000BYA5F0,"Any English speaking Santo/Lucha Libre fans out there will likely already own two of these films (on the Lucha Libre Double Feature - The Champions of Justice & Mystery in Bermuda), so the question of to buy or not to buy lies in the remaining four films in this 6 movie set.

So what do you get?  LOS VAMPIROS DE COYOACAN, LA MANSION DE LAS SIETE MOMIAS, EL CASTILLO DE LAS MOMIAS DE GUANAJUATO, and VUELVEN LOS CAMPEONES JUSTICIEROS.

Los Vampiros, also recently released in a more pricey standalone (but still maddeningly without English subtitles!) is a bit on the dull side, you can certainly understand why labels like Rise Above never got around to this one in their English subtitled releases a few years back.

Vuelven de Los Campeones Justicieros is a vastly inferior sequel to the earlier vehicle for Mil Mascaras, Blue Demon, Tinieblas, etc., but without its biggest name (i.e. Blue Demon).  A lot of mindless running around and getting into fights sandwiched between endlessly uneventful wrestling matches.

But what should interest the fan are the remaining two titles on the set: LA MANSION DE LAS SIETE MOMIAS and EL CASTILLO DE LAS MOMIAS DE GUANAJUATO.  To put it succinctly, I cannot recommend these two bizarre films enough.  Chock full of mad scientists, creepy midgets, the living dead, masked wrestlers as superheroes and a whole lot of atmosphere, it is ASTOUNDING that these were not picked up for release to the English market during the wave of Rise Above based and related Santo/Lucha Libre releases a few years back.  The closest I can think of to the general look and feel of these films is the similarly weird Isle of the Snake People, but these 2 are far, far better than that often stodgy Boris Karloff vehicle.  And for $6-10, you really can't go wrong...if you can pick up enough Spanish to get by (or don't mind just watching the images without comprehending what's going on).

Shame on companies like Sony's Lionsgate for marketing Lucha LIbre films exclusively to the Spanish language market, when all concerned are well aware that there is significant camp and genre appeal to the English speaking market for these films.",1254096000,13,2160,4.842391304347826
