7870606,5,6304411162,"""Broken Harvest"" will in time be a Classic. Despite its meagre budget and poor direction, it tells the tale of the bitterness that surrounded the aftermath of the Irish Civil War with blunt precision. The main players  in Irish life of the time are depicted with little embellishment, the Priest, the School Teacher and the Bank Manager.

The main characters, Arthur O'Leary (Colin Lane) and his wife Catherine (Marian Quinn) deliver a convincing portrayal of many middle class marriages of that time, a time when a woman stood by her man through thick and thin. 1950's Ireland was a troubled time to raise a family on a smallholding and poor Arthur O'Leary, despite his best efforts is not up to the task.

The movie captures all the emotions of the time and its stunning shots of breathtaking scenes of the Irish countryside are but a glimpse of what the Irish of today were to finally realise.

Colin Lane as Arthur gives a masterful performance as the Republican who can't forgive the likes of Free-Stater Josie (Niall O'Brien) for their betrayal, as he sees it, in settling for a 26 county Ireland and leaving the 6 counties of the North under British rule.

The movie is hard hitting and many of the emotions portrayed so well still live on today. Classic!",1165190400,3,1262,4.718181818181818
7870607,1,6304411162,"""Broken Harvest"" is a decent movie, shot for about $1 million, but the whole film is ""amateur night"" because of the T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E photography.  It is surprising too because the cinematographer, Jack Conroy, also shot ""My Left Foot.""  However, the photography spoils the whole movie.

Aiden Quinn's sister Marian is lovely as ""Kate,"" but even she is dulled by the film.  Having spent time with Adam Adams before he died, I know that a movie is nothing without a good cinematographer, and that decision is basic.  Unfortunately, this film suffers and dies--and is truly amateurish--because of that.

Exquisite scenes of the beautiful Irish countryside are ""washed out.""  Why take the time, expense, and trouble to create anything if such attention to detail is totally ignored, seemingly?  This film is little better than a ""home movie,"" I am sorry to say.  So much work done by so many people, killed by the bad photography.

Despite director Maurice O'Callaghan's comments about the need for time to obtain ""a more polished product,"" that is nonsense.  The amateur photography destroyed this film from the very first frame--and even its credits are amateurish.  There is nothing wrong with the acting, although it is a bit ""wooden"" at times.  Surely, the cinematographer will be remembered for having killed this film, I am sorry to say.

Colin Lane, as Kate's husband ""Arthur,"" reminds one of a soft-spoken Gary Cooper or Clint Eastwood.  If the movie had been more professionally done, it might have provided some ""legs"" for him.  Niall O'Brien, as ""Josey,"" is a fine character actor whose talents are wasted too, unfortunately.  If I were the director--who seems to have directed only this film, which was very personal for his large family and him--I would be embarrassed and saddened by the final product.  It was hardly worth the effort, yet with decent photography it might have had lasting value.",1156896000,,1906,5.05448717948718
7870608,4,6304411162,"This is an interesting film that starts with a flashback to the Ireland of the 50's - a 50's alien to most of us. No TV's, little electricity, rudimentary radio. Ireland was strictly agrarian and suffering the drain of its people to America - especially New York, referred to as ""the other Ireland"".  The adults of that time had lived through 'the troubles' of the Black and Tans and then the further horror of Civil War - with the 'Free-Staters' (Michael Collins followers) against the 'Republicans' (DeValera's contingent). It must have been horrible, though all that we're allowed to see is the reflection of the horror - much as the boy Jimmy O'Leary sees in his poor but proud father, Arthur's dealings with his prosperous Uncle Josie McCarthy who owns the farm next door, who loved and still loves Jimmy's mother. Arthur was a Republican and Josie a Free-Stater. Americans who expect to be 'told' every minute detail of explanation for characters' pasts may not like this film - but that's what makes it so good. We never know the full extent of that horror, but we come to appreciate and grow from that point; what the young man Jim finally achieves upon his return to the land of his father.  The sound and lighting are a bit off and some of the actors are wooden but that adds to the niceness of the story, which is, as are the characters, rough around the edges.",989107200,9,1372,4.595918367346939
