8075294,3,B000A6T21C,"I bought this video for my 3.5 year old who is tri-lingual. I wanted him to have the exposure to Spanish through stories that are culturally relevant to Spanish-speaking people. Some of the content is too mature for my 3.5 year old and I would argue would be too mature for 6-year olds as well. Some of the stories are focused too heavily on boy-girl relationships, attracting the opposite sex, etc.",1213488000,3,399,4.633802816901408
