346519,5,6301670124,"A group of aliens arrives in a Florida retirement community to rescue their colleagues who have been cocooned and settled beneath the sea. The aliens unzip and zip on their human costumes - the initial unveiling, witnessed by the boat captain, is beautiful and worthy of an award - and stash their rescued buddies in the compound's swimming pool. The retirees, after swimming in the pool, experience personal rejuvenation: they make love like teenage boys, eat like athletes, and Don Ameche's Olympian diving performance is memorable in itself. And then the retirees, now in on the secret, are asked to choose between attaining immortality by leaving with the aliens - or living our their lifespan on earth with their surviving loved ones.
Wonderful, heartening and heartbreaking, inspiring film, directed by Ron Howard, and soooo beautifully cast.",1072137600,33,848,5.242647058823529
346520,5,6301670124,"COCOONS is a film about extraterrestrials who visit Florida to rescue some comrades lost during an earlier journey. They rent a large house with a pool next to a retirement community. The swimming pool is used by the newcomers to store some large cocoons which have magical qualities providing instant youth to those who submerge themselves in the pool's waters. Eventually this amazing fact is discovered accidentally by three of the neighboring old codgers (Hume Cronyn, Don Ameche and Wilfred Brimley) and from that point on life among the senior set is changed forever. Brian Dennehy plays the part of the leader of the crew from outer space and the rest of the supporting cast includes Jack Gifford, Steve Guttenberg, Tawnee Welch and Tyrone Power Jr.
COCOONS received Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Don Ameche) and Visual Effects. The main competition for Oscars in 1985 came from OUT OF AFRICA. Ron Howard has directed some other excellent movies including A BEAUTIFUL MIND.",1062547200,,992,5.0920245398773005
346521,5,6301670124,"I've long been a bog fan of Ron Howard. I loved his acting and I also love his directing, past & present. To me, this movie ranks as one of his best.
In all fairness to the Christians that have written reviews, I'd have to agree about the language issue. I probably would've cut back on the profanity if I'd have written the script. But on the other hand, this movie didn't have the typical nudity & violence that many movies did in the 90's and still do today. So, on that end of things, it's a much better movie.
I saw this movie at a friend's house back in the 80's. Back in the fall of 2000, I bought a used copy off of the internet for myself. I usually watch it 2 to 3 times a year. I'm still amazed at the themes that are in this movie. You'll find things like marriage, family, friendship, moving on, handling tough times, and priorities, among the many. I always find myself re-examing my life after I see it.
To those that emjoyed it, I agree wholeheartedly with what's been said by those reviewers. To those that didn't, I would simply ask this: How does this movie rank with movies that actually make the theaters today? Think about it.",1056412800,4,1148,4.270642201834862
346522,1,6301670124,"I saw this first in 1985 when I was 23 years old. I don't remember what I really thought about it then. I guess I thought it was ""okay"".  Well, the library had it and so I brought it home. For 11 years or so, we had no TV or movies in our lives. Now we have a 13"" video player and watch all the great old classics. We wanted to see this to see Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn as older folks together, since we have liked them in some of the old classics.
My opinion of this film...it is horrible. It was a big waste of time for me,but I saw it through to the end, to see what I remembered. All I remembered was that the old folks swam in the pool with the cocoons in it and felt better. That's about it. If I had remembered all the inappropriate language ( I just don't like hearing people swearing, and to hear old folks swearing and using sexual gutter language is even worse!) I wouldn't have bothered to watch it. I love how in the old films, everyone got along just fine without swearing all the time. Why do the modern films have to have it? People call this a family film??? I wouldn't let my children watch it, when everyone is swearing and grandpa uses words like ""boner"".  I don't go for fantasy stuff and I felt this film was a bit corny in that area.
One very humorous thing was the clothes in this film. Sure,you can expect old folks to lack in taste somewhat, but everyone did!  It was hilarious...I mean were some of those outfits for real, or a joke??? Those plaid pants, those brightly colored leisure jackets with weird patterns...
I am a Christian and also did not like the fact that this film gives people a false picture of the reality of eternity for man.
Was glad when this was over, but my 19 yr. old daughter was gladder. We put in a 1930's film right afterwards to help us forget the cinematic strangeness we had just witnessed. How nice to watch a good film where people can communicate effectively without any swearing!",1043798400,5,1945,4.223118279569892
346523,5,6301670124,"What a wonderful movie.  This movie Cocoon takes place in a nursing home in a coastal town.  The inhabitants of the nursing home, Don Amache, Maureen Stapleton, Gwen Verdon, and I can't remember any of the others escape the nursing home and find an indoor pool that didn't belong to them.  They played like children in the pool, until the pool manager told them they had no right to be there.  At that point they had found space cocoons with aliens inside.  Those cocoons were originally placed in the ocean, but had been placed in the pool.  In the end the residents
moved with the aliens to their planet so they could live forever.
The cast in this movie was wonderful, especially Gwen Verdon who played Bess McCarthy, her best role since DAMN YANKEES.  You are sure to love her.  She has red hair, buck teeth, her voice is like a quiet whisper.  I liked the part at the beginning when she was leading the residents in a dance singing.  ""And swing em to the left, and swing 'em to the right.  Then you do the twist with all your might.  Shake it to the front and shake it to the back.  That's what we call dancing!""
This is a must have for anyone who likes action movies.
Enjoy",1029542400,9,1179,4.328767123287672
346524,4,6301670124,"If you have read Stephen King's Dreamcatcher, please get to this film. A positive vision of Extraterrestrials. They are a world where people do not age, where there is no war, where is no disease, where there is no hatred. We can of course think there are no feelings either. Yet, there are and when they are confronted to the human world they discover feelings in no time, and those are not human at all, they are universal : the  sadness of death, the sadness of leaving friends, and a few others, even love. Old people dream of living forever, even if it means being productive forever. There is nothing worse for pensioners than to be pensioners, that is to say people completely controled by rules and who have no productive activities for society or other people. A world of eternal productivity is a dream that only pensioners can afford. But it is the most human and the deepest feeling of them all. And this can only come from an estraterrestrial vision of the world. Will our society get to that level, ever, we don't know, we hope so, but we definitely cannot say it will happen ever. A marvelous film about aging and the drama of becoming useless for society, and a slave of dumb rules that deprive you of any freedom or free choice. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",987379200,10,1298,4.547008547008547

346660,5,6301670124,"It's a Ron Howard film? How can it be bad?
Cocoon is the story of three men  living in a retirement village in Florida.
Each day they sneak into the empty mansion next door and go swimming.
One day, they see odd objects in the pool, but swim anyway.
What happens next is what takes this movie from mild fun to amzing.

Played to the hilt by veteran actors Don Ameche, Wilford Brimley, Jack Gilford, and Hume Cronyn, it co-stars Steve Guttenberg, Maureen Stapleton, Jessica Tandy (Cronyn's real life wife)  Linda Harrison (Planet of the apes),Barret Oliver,  the lovely Gwen Verdon, Tahnee Welch and my favorite, Brian Dennehy, as a very likeable --well, his name is Walter.

The cast is perfect.  They are all such likeable characters you don't want to let them go, which is probably why they made a Cocoon 2.
Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

346690,5,6301670124,"In the world of science fiction, extra-terrestrials are often deemed as evil invaders as some of the films such as War of the Worlds and Independence Day show. During late 70s and 80s Steven Spielberg and ILM team depicted good-natured aliens as The Encounter of the Third World, and ET show. Cocoon released in 1985 directed by Ron Howard is one of the good-alien category films but with different twist.

The film is based on the novel of the same title by David Saperstein but developed in this film slightly different from the novel edition. The biggest difference is that the Antarians disclosed of their purpose right from the start while the film let the Jack find out accidentally. And the film has the original characters such as David one of the grandchildren of some of the elderly characters and Kitty one of the Antarian crewmen as the Jack's love interest. With such alterations the drama became a lot more entertaining for wild range of moviegoers. What is more impressive is the superb acting of elderly characters who used to be star actors (actresses) during the old days. Great elderly actors(actresses) include Jessica Tandy (Driving with Miss Daisy) and Hume Cronym the couple who happened to have the role of the old married couple, Don Ameche who then had the 50-year acting career, Wilford Brimley as Ben the grandfather of David played by one of the most popular child actors at that time Barrett Oliver (Never Ending Story and DARYL) and a lot more great actors I could not recognize that much. Steve Guttenberg of Police Academy series plays the role of Jack, the charter boat captain for tourists. While the SFX techniques are subtly used until the mid stage of the drama, the last sequence has the copious amount of them. In a nutshell, this is the sci-fi film with deep drama and fantasy.",1477612800,2,1818,4.771428571428571

346775,5,6301670124,"STILL DELIGHTFUL!  Thirty years ago I remember Gene Shalit, film critic for the Today Show saying, ""You know how you are always looking for a movie you can take your kids to?  This is one you can take your parents to!""  This movie is 30 years old, so now I am a senior citizen in charge of movie night at our retirement facility.  We showed this one last week, and everyone--even guests of seniors--loved it!  Humor, pathos, development of characters, and something to leave you thinking about.  It is the story of three old geezers living in a retirement community, two with their wives, with the usual aches and pains but nothing really bad, who like the sneak next door to swim in the indoor pool of an estate that is on the market.  A group of four or five people of mixed ages comes to town and rents it but does not live there, so the pool is functional.  They also rent the services of a down and out day boater (Steve Gutenberg) for a month to take them diving.  They bring up huge cocoon-shaped barnacle-encrusted rocks that they transport to the pool in the estate.  In the meantime, the geezers are getting more and more spry as they sneak in for their daily swims.  Sorry, you'll have to see the rest for yourself.  And you will love it too.",1440115200,,1253,4.376623376623376

346891,5,6301670124,"COCOON is a mild-mannered science fiction movie taking place in the vicinity of an old folks home somewhere along the coast of Florida.  The main characters have plenty of ""star power,"" and these include Don Ameche, Hume Cronyn, Brian Dennehy, Maureen Stapleton, and Jessica Tandy.  Some of these names are ""household words"" for people familiar with the history of American cinema and television, and so there is no point in reiterating what is already common knowledge.  That said, I have admired Mr. Dennehy's role in the movie, NEVER CRY WOLF, and I have admired Don Ameche's role in THE STORY OF ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL.

THE PLOT.  This is not a Twilight-Zone story with a surprise ending, and so I will go ahead and tell elements of the entire story.  COCOON is more about character-development, and about making decisions along life's pathway.  The story begins when some ordinary-looking visitor (actually aliens) approach a young boat-rental operator with a need to rent a boat for a month.  They rent the boat, and spend their time busily plucking large moss-covered boulders from a sunken hiding place, and transporting them to an indoor swimming pool near an old folks home.  Anybody who has seen INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (the black and white version, not the stupid color version) will easily guess what is inside the boulders.  The viewer is exposed to humorous episodes and also not-so-humorous episodes of the old folks home residents coming to terms with their dwindling health, weakening eyesight, and threat to their mortality.  As the plot unfolds itself, the old folks discover that if they swim around in the pool that contains the boulders (pods containing ancient, but living, aliens) they will feel younger again.  Some of the more pleasant parts of the movie show the old folks playing a lively game of basketball, ballroom dancing at a Florida disco, and even break dancing.  At any rate, the aliens eventually discover what is going on, and they soon realize that the behavior of the old folks in bathing in the pool has sapped the energy of the ancient aliens that reside within the boulders --  with the consequence that the ancient aliens lose their vitality and are on the verge of dying.  The aliens then decide to replace the boulders in their original underwater hiding place, with the intention of picking them up at a later time.  The story ends when the old folks, agree to be transported with the aliens in their flying saucer back to the alien planet.

SPECIAL EFFECTS.  COCOON does not disappoint, as far as special effects are concern.  The flying saucer is seen only at the very end, but at least, we are treated to a fine flying saucer.  It is a standard flying saucer, such as that seen in ROSWELL, starring Kyle MacLachlan and featuring Dwight Yokum, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, starring Micheal Rennie, and ALIEN TRESPASS, starring Eric McCormack, Jenni Baird, and Robert Patrick.  One original special effect is that the aliens take the form of glowing lava in the form of a human being, and when they walk around or even sit, brightly colored smoke is emitted from their body.  The aliens come dressed in human skin, and a couple of the scenes shows the aliens peeling the human skin off from their body, and dumping the ""skin costume"" in a little heap on the floor.

CONCUPISCENCE.  The boat operator is a young man, and he is portrayed as a likeable sleezebag.  He is interested in the female alien, and in trying to persuade her to engage in concupiscent behavior with him, he says, ""I am not trying to nail you.""  Eventually, the boat operator succeeds in engaging in concupiscent behavior with the alien, but on her terms.  At first, he is disgusted when he spies through the keyhole of the room on the boat where the female alien stays.  He watches her take off her earthling-type clothes, and then he sees her peel off her human skin.  As I mentioned, the boat operator is initially disgusted, but he soon overcomes the slight problem that the alien is really made of glowing lava.  And so, in one of the later scenes in the film, the young man and the alien (dressed in her usual human female skin) are in the swimming pool together, and the alien emits a glowing comet-sort-of-thing, and the comet-sort-of-thing bounces about the walls of the swimming pool room, and eventually strikes the young man, inducing a feeling of fulfillment.  Anyway, ho-hum.

CONCLUSION. INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is similar to COCOON in that both involve aliens that reside in pods.  But the plot lines of these two movies are totally different.  AWAKENINGS with Robin Williams and Robert De Niro is more similar to COCOON, in that both movies involve old people who are deteriorated, and are transformed into vibrant active folks who like to dance.  In AWAKENINGS, the transformation was caused by an administered drug, while in COCOON the transformation was caused by a substance in a swimming pool.  I think that both movies -- COCOON and AWAKENINGS -- have comparable lessons on mortality. The old people in the cast are a fine ensemble. It is an ensemble piece.  Also on the plus side, there are no explosions in this movie, and nobody gets killed, and there are no bad words.  On the minus side, there are several seconds of footage of local seabirds, that is, brown pelicans and egrets.  But the cinematography of these avian creatures is not very good. Anybody familiar with the habits of brown pelicans could have provided much better footage, for example, of the way groups of two dozen brown pelicans glide in a straight line just a foot or so off from the surface of the ocean.",1394496000,2,5638,4.785123966942149

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Takeaway the aliens from director Ron Howard's 1985 film Cocoon' and you no longer have ""science fiction,"" but a drama about the enduring human spirit. This oft-overlooked gem from the mid-1980s took a step back from the onslaught of hyperactive special effects and paranoia associated with the ""me"" generation and instead, like Steven Spielberg's E.T., inserted a breath of fresh air, relaxation, optimism that hearkened back to another Steven Spielberg sci-fi film, Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'

Unlike the latter that came along at a time when the country and the world were in an emotional and financial funk, with dismal spirits all around, `E.T.' and `Cocoon' came at a time during the 1980s when people were riding a seeming financial boom. It was the decade of skinny ties, the Hollywood blockbuster and yuppies. Science fiction was meant to be spectacle and it was Dune,' Blade Runner,' Alien,' and Terminator.' We were going to be destroyed by our technological success or by an unknown entity and that was that. But in `Cocoon' was a quiet story crafted around characters that offered an inward and almost nave optimism that returned to the 1970s, or perhaps even the 1960s era of plain drama.

In Cocoon' a group of elderly people in a nursing home accidentally discovers the fountain of youth in the swimming pool of a vacant home next to their residence. It turns out, however, that the ""fountain"" is really causing their reinvigoration due to alien cocoons that are resting there. After purchasing the house, a group of aliens has been scavenging their cocoons from the sea floor and resting them in the house's pool. They discover the elderly folks swimming, but agree to allow them to continue to swim there and benefit from the pool's energy. Cocoon' has a cast is filled with veteran actors like Jessica Tandy, Don Ameche and Maureen Stapleton and also features Steve Guttenberg as the boat captain helping the aliens recover their cocoons.

The alterations to the old folk's lives begin to have repercussions beyond just their newfound youth. It forces them to re-examine what they want out of life and from their partners. Beyond being just a story of the elderly seeking to regain their youth, `Cocoon' is a film about the undying energy of the spirit within us all, regardless of our age. It's a feel good film for sure, and it may be unevenly charted between comedy, drama, and science fiction, but it is a wholesomely enjoyable gem nonetheless.

In closing, `Cocoon' was a bit of a stretch out into new storytelling territory at the time for director Ron Howard, as he himself even discusses briefly in the provided supplements. However, looking at it closely, going towards the sci-fi direction was not too much of a departure from a fantasy oriented film about a mermaid in `Splash.' Larger than the plotline of ""Antareans"" gathering extra-terrestrial cocoons from the ocean floor is the story within the elderly men who become involved with the life force charmed pool. This element of the story feels sincerely more like Ron Howard's touch, as the emotions and scenarios involved with the elderly regaining their youth and vitality brings about a fork in the road of whether reversing their decline of health is right or wrong. On the side regarding the film's sci-fi pieces, it doesn't go way over-the-top and become outrageous and silly, but rather leaves a lot to the viewer's imagination. This does help keep the story stable, as the film is strongly a bit of a pop-culture icon, with references to its unique story seen in many outlets of entertainment over the years, and with that in mind it is worthy of a solid endorsement.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Cocoon' gets a wonderful 1080p encoded upgraded image with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. For a 1985 film, this is definitely an impressive transfer considering the film's 25 year-old age. For the most part, the picture looks very clean, rarely exhibiting the usual soft quality seen in films from the 1980s and even the 1990s and typically, the rare occasions that a softer video quality is present are usually in specific interior shots that are largely relying on natural lighting beaming in through windows. Otherwise, the Hi-Definition presentation of this film has a very clean look, with well-balanced saturation that in no way suggested the film's age, and a colour palette that is mostly neutral, exhibiting flesh tones with the most accuracy possible, and a black level that is nearly solid. Though the release is certainly not excessively soft in its presentation, definition of little details is not intense; however, it is still a definite improvement to any other releases of `Cocoon.' A few close-ups of actors and/or props render what detail has been uncovered with this High Definition transfer, and when looking at other Blu-ray releases of films from this era, `Cocoon' considerably outranks many others in the video quality department. There is an insignificant amount of small flaws that occur throughout the release's runtime, mostly being interfaced deformation, though other typical artefacts, such as hairs, dirt, and specs, are basically obsolete. Perhaps the original source for this transfer had simply not succumbed to many elements/conditions that would have deteriorated its quality, or may be the situation of this film's Hi-Definition transfer was simply more precise and thorough in cleaning up the flaws, but regardless, the Blu-ray release of Cocoon' is an impressive example of how films two decades old can look.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Cocoon' soundtrack has been spruced up quite a bit for this Blu-ray release and given a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix. With the opening of the film's story, we see the ""Antareans"" beaming the light of their spaceship above the ocean where their remaining race lies underwater in cocoons. The presence of their spaceship, and the chirping of the dolphins surrounding the area all creates an interesting conveyance of sound from the 5.1 setup, having a nearly metaphysical quality as it pans about the rear and front channels, and also makes for usage of the subwoofer. As amazing as this first moment in the audio track is, following along with the rest of the film's content, the soundscape remains a bit more placid throughout the release's runtime, though still retains a great performance. Dialogue is delivered perfectly without any flaws, and several examples of sound effects translate without issues, whether they are from natural surroundings, or a computer generated synthetic sound to depict the Antareans. There are a few minutes' worth of intense audio content, aside from the described beginning, throughout the release's runtime that really show a kick-up in the audio track's performance, but otherwise the content relies on a more general well-balanced presentation, though is still worth a more than decent.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: There's nothing new provided on this release of Cocoon,' but viewers may still find the archival documentary that offers you the vintage interview segments of the cast, crew and filmmakers quite a treat.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Ron Howard: One of the nicest guys in Hollywood gives a candid, friendly, and informative commentary track that spans the usual topics and technical details, on-set stories, and other pertinent reminiscences. Well worth your time if you enjoy the film.

Theatrical Trailer: Cocoon: The Return Theatrical Teaser [480i] [1:20]

Finally, kick back and prepare for some warm light hearted sci-fi fun that forgoes the reliance on special effects and actually remembers there are people in the world. Cocoon' image is rather stellar, rarely becoming genuinely exceptional but always getting the job done in a satisfactory transfer. The special effects sequence come close to providing some real pop, but otherwise the transfer just offers a natural, warm image with solid detail. Flesh tones are warm and accurate while darker scenes benefit from good depth. Cocoon' itself on this Blu-ray disc has gotten some life-extending rejuvenation, thanks to a strong high definition transfer by 20th Century Fox and I am so pleased to have this unique Limited Edition SteelBook in my extensive Blu-ray Collection and especially a really great favourite film of mine, but now I wish they would release the follow up Cocoon: The Return' as a Limited Edition SteelBook Blu-ray as well. Highly Recommended!

346989,5,6301670124,"I haven't seen Ron Howard's ""Cocoon"" (1985) for about twenty years and am so glad I purchased it recently.

On the surface the film's about elderly folks at a retirement home in Florida unknowingly discovering the ""fountain of youth"" via a pool on an adjacent property. A peculiar group of people rent the property to store boulder-like objects they take from the bottom of the ocean. As such, the pool acquires healing powers and restore's the old folk's youthful vigor, to say the least.

Steve Guttenberg stars as the likable protagonist, the boat owner/operator who helps the people get to the objects in the ocean, but he has no idea what's really going on. The stunning Tahnee Welch -- Raquel's daughter -- plays one of the members of the peculiar group to whom Guttenberg takes a liking. Unlike Raquel, who's known for being a bit biyatchy, Tahnee shines with a winsome disposition. Brian Dennehy is also on hand as the leader of the odd group, and he does very well.

Most great movies have a deeper subtext, and so it is with ""Cocoon."" The story is a commentary on aging, death, grieving and the yearning for eternal life. The people of the peculiar group are types of angels or, better yet, the redeemed in glorified bodies. What they offer is the gospel, the key to eternal life in the ""new heavens and new earth, the home of righteousness"" (2 Peter 3:13). By ""the redeemed in glorified bodies"" I'm referring to the glorious bodies that are promised to believers at the time of their bodily resurrection (1 Cor. 15:42-44); these bodies will be imperishable, powerful and spiritual (not carnal) in nature. Believers will be able to defy gravity with these new bodies, walk through doors and teleport from one place to another, all of which can be seen in Jesus Christ after his resurrection.

Needless to say, ""Cocoon"" has an incredible subtext. But it's not necessary to get so deep. This is just an entertaining movie with a good heart. More than that, it's inspiring.

The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in the Clearwater/St. Petersburg area of Florida and the underwater scenes in the Bahamas.

It's not the typical E.T.-style sci-fi fare with kids finding cute aliens. Instead, the protagonists in Cocoon are elderly men from a retirement community. The men swim in a pool with alien eggs, which has the side effect of increasing their virility. They ultimately rediscover their youths. While at times cheesy, the film works because of some superb acting, genuinely emotion moments, and low-key special effects. Unfortunately, the ending seems a bit out of place, a move away from what makes the rest of the movie so powerful (I won't spoilt it though).

347028,3,6301670124,"Ron Howard's COCOON (1985), while an entertaining and charming film on many levels, is really a young man's view of what it's like to grow old.  The story revolves around a group of senior citizens living in a Florida retirement community who discover that their neighbor's indoor swimming pool doubles as a Fountain of Youth.  Wilford Brimley, Don Amici, and Hume Cronyn are the three friends who first discover the magic water, to the delight of their wives and girlfriends (Maureen Stapleton, Gwen Verdon, and Jessica Tandy).  There are a lot of funny scenes about renewed libido, break dancing, and suddenly being able to read the bottom line on the eye chart at Motor Vehicles.  And it's fun watching these old timers getting a new lease on life.

The parellel story is about aliens, who have returned to Earth to collect their friends who have been hibernating for ten thousand years in rock-like cocoons at the bottom of the ocean.  Brian Dennehy plays the head alien, Tahnee Welch plays his gorgeous lieutenant, and Steve Guttenberg plays the human boat captain who helps them retrieve the cocoons.  The aliens have been storing these cocoons in the above-mentioned swimming pool, and using their alien super powers to charge the water with life-restoring energy.  This is why the senior citizens are suddenly running around like college kids with all the energy in the world.

All this works, and it's a cute film with plenty of screen time for some older actors who deserve to play center stage.  What doesn't work, however, is the film's final act.

[***SPOILERS AHEAD*** PLEASE STOP HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM]

Brian Dennehy offers Brimley and his friends the chance to return with them to outer space, where they will be productive again and will live virtually forever.  But the price of such longevity will be never seeing their families again.  That means Brimley and Stapleton will never see their daughter again, or the little grandson who has been so much a part of their lives.  There is a horrible scene where Brimley takes his grandson fishing and tells him he'll be going away to a place where he'll never get sick and he'll never die, but he'll never see the boy again.  There's also a scene where Brimley and Stapleton are discussing Dennehy's offer.  Brimley asks her, ""Are you having second thoughts?""  She admits she is, and that she doesn't want to leave her daughter and grandson.  Brimley then ignores that little problem and wonders if what she really objects to is ""cheating nature.""  He says, ""The way nature has been treating us lately, I don't mind cheating her a little.""

But the problem with all this isn't that it's cheating nature.  It's that living forever just the sake of living forever doesn't make sense.  Hume Cronyn gets it right when he tells his wife (who leaves him briefly when she realizes he's returned to his womanizing ways), ""I don't want to live forever if you're not with me.""  Well, he's absolutely right, but it's not just about husbands and wives being together.  I'm old enough to know that living forever would be painful without my sons, their future children, and the rest of the people who have been so important in my life.  I can't imagine anyone willingly giving up their children and grandchildren for eternal life without them.  What would be the point?

I say this is a young man's view of what it's like to grow old because it's all focused on fear of death.  It's not death that frightens us older adults, it's loss.  And there would be no greater loss than that of my children and grandchildren.  It's all very wonderful that Amici can break dance, and Brimley gets a ""boner,"" and Cronyn's cancer goes into remission.  But it makes no sense that any of them would walk away from everything they know and love just to live forever in an alien universe.  A young man - Howard was 30 when he made this film - might think the chance to live forever would trump everything else.  But I don't think many older people would.

I still like a lot of things about this film (thus the three stars), but it irritates me every time I watch it.  And I always cry when Brimley tells his grandson he's leaving him.  Think about that for a minute - what he's telling this little boy is that he'd rather live forever without him than ten or twenty more years with him.  What does that say about the value of this child?  And what does it say about Brimley?  It creates a depressing ending to what could have been a very uplifting film.",1342137600,7,4501,4.655259822560203
347029,4,6301670124,"I'm going to tag this one ""all star cast"" partly because a lot of the people are faces that are terribly familiar, but I am no good at putting a name on each face. Don Ameche, Maureen Stapleton, Hume Cronyn, Gwen Verdon, Jack Gilford, Brian Dennehy, and I'm sure I'm leaving several great oldies out.

Yes, it's a story about old people. In fact, they live in a retirement home in Florida. Three of them have gotten into the habit of ""breaking in"" to the expensive estate next door to use the indoor pool. The place has been empty for a long time, and in fact is on the market to sell.

Then a group of nice people lease it for 27 days. Why 27 days? Because then their mother space ship will be back to pick them up. In the meantime, they must rescue the survivors of a disaster some 10,000 years ago, who are under the ocean in cocoons, not actually dead, but not alive either.

In the meantime, they are keeping the cocoons they raise from the ocean floor in the indoor pool in the rental. And so of course our three old friends next door get involved. Because it seems that swimming in the same water with these pods makes them feel young again, spontaneously throws leukemia into remission, and even makes them horny.

But trouble breaks out when loose lips start talking about ""fountain of youth"" in the dining room, and suddenly there's a stampede for the swimming pool next door. This has the effect of ruining the Anterians' rescue effort, so they have to put the cocoons back into the ocean and keep their appointment to meet the mother ship. Since they are not taking the cocoons back with them, they have room for up to 30 of the old people who have become their friends. On Anteria, their planet, they will never get any older, never be sick, and never die. Which ones accept the offer and which ones decline, and why, is an interesting character study.

There's a lot of comedy, and a lot of tender moments. There's also a magnificent representation of sex between a human and one of the aliens. Can't describe it, you have to see it. The alien in question wears a body suit which makes her a gorgeous young human, of course, but takes it off to ""share herself"" with the overwhelmed captain of the charter boat they have hired.

Before Cocoon, very few movies showed older people in such a favorable light, especially in relation to what they feel and even about their bodies and lovemaking.

That all changed at the moment in this film when Hume Cronyn's character got into bed, preparing to make love to Jessica Tandy's character, and he patted the bed beside himself, inviting her to join him.

I wasn't an older adult when the movie came out, but that one moment was such a nice revelation. Old people do it, too! And it was presented so tastefully and warmly, that you truly caught what it meant to have the ""spark"" flaming again.

A movie doesn't always have to be perfect in order to be perfect, and ""Cocoon"" is an example of a movie where seemingly disparate elements make up for a beautiful experience.

The film deals with an issue all of us will eventuallly face: whether to ""go gentle into that good night"" and accept gracefully the inevitable limitations of ageing and death, or to ""rage, rage against the coming of the night,"" or, as an earlier potet expressed it, ""whether to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them.""

They kept the recovered cocoons in the swimming pool of a house they rented in a small Florida town. Their mission is hampered by a number of old people from an elderly home nearby, who have been secretly using the pool and discovering the unusual power of these cocoons. 'COCOON' is much less a sci-fi movie than it is a drama, and a brilliant one at that. Howard provides both humor and touching tear-jerking moments and handles them both very well. A very charming movie that much deserves to be seen by everyone.",1264291200,,683,4.472

However a group of aliens from another planet are on a secret mission to retreive the cocoons so they can return them back their planet, only a boat captain (Steve Guttenburg) with the old folks can help these poor aliens disguised as humans.

Co-starring Barret Oliver, Brian Denenhy, Tahnee Welch and Clint Howard this is a magical and unique Sci-fi fantasy comedy drama from Ron Howard as it's one of his best movies. It's a celebration of the human spirit through the eyes of old folks discover how it feels to be young again with excellent acting by the essembled cast and quality direction from Ron Howard, excellent special effects by ILM and Greg Cannon (""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", ""The Lost Boys"") and of course a rousing score by James Horner. It's one of the most original Sci-fi movies of it's decade and has became a critically acclaimed box-office hit in the summer of 1985, Don Ameche himself earned an academy award for best actor. It's a funny, moving and vibrant epic adventure that is a must see movie for anyone who enjoys a good Science Fiction or dramatic movie.

347120,5,6301670124,"It was Father's Day, 1985. ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"" was the big movie playing against this Ron Howard film, which was still going strong. I'd convinced the family to see this movie on the strength of Siskel & Ebert's ""At The Movies"" review. Once we were seated in the nearly full theater, I heard a kid grumble about this not being ""Indiana Jones..."" The spaceship did a planetary flyby, and movie magic took over. My father, one of ""The Greatest Generation,"" who'd weathered the deaths of his parents shortly before and during The Depression, and served with the 442nd RCT in Italy was a no-nonsense sort. He mentioned that this was a good film, a little far-fetched, but nice nevertheless. I suspect that seeing classic actors like Don Ameche in a lively film about taking chances and meeting Life head on made his day. He died in 1998, but this is/was something wonderful that the whole family enjoyed. And I didn't hear another peep out of that kid about missing ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom,"" either.",1192579200,3,1028,4.685082872928176

347122,3,6301670124,"""Cocoon"" is a good Sunday afternoon, put-your-feet-up-and-sit-back type of film. Nothing more, nothing less. It's real old fashioned entertainment. And while I like this film, I really am surprised just how revered it is. Some call it a ""classic"" which really is stretching things just a tad. Not to rain on anyone's parade, but having just watched this film again, after not having seen it since it originally came out, I was struck by just how under-developed the whole film was. The focus of the film is (deservedly so) on the elderly characters who get a new shot at life, so to speak. This then relegates the rest of the characters to nothing more than background dressing. Perhaps there were a few scenes (reels, maybe?) that were cut from the film or just not filmed. And yes, I know that a lot of people will decry my review as being ""ageist"" -- however, this being a sci-fi film, one would think that the alien angle would have been beefed up a bit more. As it stands, the revelation of the alien's identities and intentions are so conveniently and expediently accepted by the characters that one would presume the aliens are capable of mind-control; however that would be to introduce a sinister underpinning to the film and that sort of complexity would have gone against what Ron Howard was trying to convey. I would assume that Ron Howard just didn't have a strong handle on the material, nor a clear vision of exactly what he wanted to convey with the story. I personally felt that Wilford Brimley's decision to go away with the aliens was terribly insensitive to his grand-son's needs, not to mention unrealistic. I know it's ""only a movie"" but some kind of wisdom (in keeping with the older makes wiser notion, if nothing else) would have made for a stronger conclusion.

Steve Guttenberg's character was completely under-developed, apart from playing boat captain, then peeping tom, then fodder for the token alien-human love scene. The same for the alien characters. I mean, casting Brian Dennehy and then not utilising his talents is like casting Robert De Niro in the role of Darth Vader and not using his voice either!

There are a lot of aspects (characters and situations) that Ron Howard had to juggle with this film, and once again, it comes down to his handling of the material that impedes the film. The inclusion of Guttenberg's and Tahnee Welch's love interest is obviously in catering to a younger demographic, and really wasn't necessary. It plays out as tacked on and not realistic or natural. More screen time and development of these two characters would have served the film better and made the love scene less intrusive and more necessary to the plot.

Overall, this movie is a good movie, very entertaining and it is great to see some veteran older actors/actresses getting their due, however, it's just not a true cinema classic. I would suggest that anyone wanting to see a film concerning old people that most definitely IS a classic, do yourself a favour and buy David Lynch's ""The Straight Story"" one of the warmest, sincerest and original films ever conceived. And don't let the fact that David Lynch directed it put you off. If you only think Lynch is capable of producing ""weird for weird sake"" type films (and I love Lynch's work), then allow ""The Straight Story"" (and yes, the title is meant to be somewhat ironic) to dispell those preconceptions.",1174176000,2,3394,4.78839590443686
347123,5,6301670124,"Since this movie is now more than twenty years old (shocking), I realized that my teenagers had not seen it, so I rented it and we watched it together.  It still holds up quite well.  This is because the story is really quite strong.  The old guys are charming and keep us engaged, but will they get in trouble for trespassing?  Who are these strangers that rent Jack Bonner's (Steve Guttenberg) boat for 27 days and the estate with the pool for 26?  What can they be up to?  Why do they seem to be able to communicate with dolphins?

This movie, even more than the wonderful ""Trading Places"", gave a new spark to Don Ameche's late career because his character, Arthur Selwyn, is so charming and likeable.  Break Dancing was quite new to the popular culture in 1985 and to see ""him"" doing those moves was delightful.  It was shot quite well and still fools audiences about which moves are from Don Ameche and which are stunt folks and trick shots.  His ballroom dancing with Gwen Verdon's Bess is also quite elegantly done.

Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy as Joseph and Alma Finley bring their personal love for each other to the screen and add a great deal to the story.  We see that regaining the vigor of youth can have a downside if you weren't all that well grounded as a youth.  Jack Gilford and Heta Ware play Bernard and Rosie Lefkowitz.  Rosie is kind of out of it and very sad.  She is sicker than she let's Bernard know.  Bernard is a man who KNOWS how the world should be and that this pool isn't anything close to right.  Yet, in the end, his certitude costs him what he loves most.  It is a very touching scene.

Wildford Brimley and Maureen Stapleton play Benjamin and Marilyn Lukett.  They are the anchor to the story.  Benjamin has a young grandson whom he loves and this presents issues as the story progresses, for good and ill.  The grandson, David (well portrayed by Barret Oliver), has a difficult relationship with his parents and is probably too attached to his grandpa Benjamin.  Again, this has implications as the story progresses.

There is suspense in the unfolding of the story (if you haven't already scene how things turn out).  Director Ron Howard and the writers did a fine job in keeping us in the moment of the film and a bit off balance as to what was actually happening.  There is some fine comedy, too.  There is a touch of romance and some tender scenes to balance the raucous fun and even some threatening moments.

It really does run a wide range of emotions and story types.

One interesting bit I didn't know until watching the movie this time is that Wilford Brimley was playing old.  He was only fifty-one when the film came out and is really only four years older than Brian Dennehy and twenty years and more younger than the other ""old folks"" whom he pals around with.  Even Maureen Stapleton who played his wife, was nine years older.

This is an excellent movie that deserves to be scene by new audiences and holds up to repeated viewings very well.",1170720000,2,2998,4.484288354898337
347124,5,6301670124,"The Film COCOON is a definite  classic. It's much more than just a comedy. The basic  outline of the Aliens who come  to rescue their groundcrew and how some old folks get involved is revealing on many levels. It is a great film with superb entertainment value, and if you look at it more deeply( after listening to The Directors Commentary)then you will  be the richer for it.
The majority of scenes are all ""practical"" using the existing places in  St Petersburg on the West Coast of Florida; this  area is very historic in all respects. What some people may miss is that the evening shots are  mostly done in or near  the Bahamas( East Coast !!), so that was a bit of a cheat.
Anyway, the only down side of this edition is the dual Sided single Disc with Widescreen and Full Screen... those single discs  with two sides  are such a headache since their  size is not consistent with most players ( especially PC  based Players) but works  perfectly on the DVP 642  by Phillips, as at this  date, that Phillips  DVD player is the best value for dollar DVD  player  around in Zone 1, which  also  plays mutiple Zones of various  discs.
The Extra  features are very good, especially on the general  cost of this  disc  which is usually under 6 dollars.
You will see the problems with Analogue to digital transfers ( especially  near the start) where the window shot is done Chroma-key, and some visual definition issues  occur, which COULD have been cleaned up if the studio had spent the money.

Overall  , an excellent  package.",1155340800,5,1529,4.535055350553505

One of the kind, innocent character's death in the film and the moments leading up to it is probably one of the saddest things you'll see in a movie.

This DVD offers some fun special features, most notably the director's commentary with the amusing and articulate Howard.

As you learn from the commentary by Ron Howard, many lines were improvised on the spot and add immeasurably to the emotional texture of the screenplay.

347165,5,6301670124,"""Cocoon"" is an excellent movie that should be enjoyable to the whole family.  It is the story of a virtual fountain of youth discovered by several elderly men in a nearby nursing home.  They check out a private swimming pool that has some large pods on it.  They come back invigorated and start to make regular trips to the pool.  It turns out that the pool's pods are alien cocoons nutured by the special water of the pool.  Well, the story takes off from there.

""Cocoon"" is a sort of social comedy that appeals to virtually all groups on different levels.  It will appeal to the elderly with a semi-serious look at aging and the pros and cons of looking to reverse the process.  Is growing old a bad things to be avoided or is it a honor that is entered into gracefully?  We can see both sides through the various characters.  The youngsters in the audience will focus with interest on the aliens.  Everybody, except the most cynical amonst us, will enjoy the comedy and stranges twists that the movie takes.

This is a ""feel good"" movie and Ron Howard seems to be the right director for the job.  The acting is good and involves some of the better senior actors available.

If you're wondering why there don't seem to be any ""good"" movies these days, go back and check out ""Cocoon"".  It may be just the kind of movie you've been wanting to see.",1117584000,2,1348,4.4227642276422765

347169,5,6301670124,"In 1985, the well-known actor/director Ron Howard directed the charming and endearing sci-fi film ""Cocoon"".  Set along the Florida coast, a group of aliens that have taken human form return to Earth to retrieve shipmates that they were forced to leave behind in suspended animation thousands of years ago.  They hire a boat owned by Jack Bonner (Steve Guttenberg), who believes that his employers are nothing more than a group of divers and is very attracted to one of them who is named Kitty (Tahnee Welch).  The alien in charge goes by the name of Walter (Brian Dennehy).  After retrieving some very large objects from the ocean depths, the aliens take the objects to an indoor swimming pool within a large beach house that they have rented.  Next door to the beach house is a retirement home.  The aliens' activities as well as the desire to swim within the pool tempts several of the retirement home's eldery residents to sneak into the private beach house.  These residents, which include Arthur Selwyn (Don Ameche, 1908-1993), Benjamin Luckett (Wilford Brimley) and Joseph Finley (Hume Cronyn, 1911-2003), start to feel invigorated after taking a swim in the pool; so they invite their wives to join them: Marilyn Luckett (Maureen Stapleton), Alma Finley (Jessica Tandy, 1909-1994) and Bess McCarthy (Gwen Verdon, 1925-2000).  As their health and strength continue to improve, the six try to keep their illicit swimming pool activies a secret, but are not entirely successful.  Further, not everyone offered restored youth approves.
With its brilliant story, acting and directing, ""Cocoon"" won Don Ameche an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and the film itself won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects.  Other memorable characters in the film include Bernard Lefkowitz (Jack Gilford, 1908-1990), his wife Rosie Lefkowitz (Herta Ware), Benjamin & Marilyn's grandson David (Barret Oliver) and Susan (Linda Harrison, who played the character Nova in the 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"").  Memorable scenes include the swimming pool scenes, Jack and Kitty, the six residents doing various activities that they otherwise couldn't do, no longer a secret, and the closing scenes.
