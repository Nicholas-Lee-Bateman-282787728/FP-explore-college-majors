5616510,5,B00BGGIWGG,"I enjoy listening to the Lawrence Welk band's specials.  It brought back memories of times I spent with my grandma. She loved listening to Lawrence Welk and shared her enjoyment with me.  The sound and recording of the picture isn't the best, but you can still hear the wonderful band, the great singers, and see the dances.  I enjoy the ads in the shows too.  I enjoyed all the specials and episodes of the Lawrence Welk Show.  Glad I discovered them on amazon!",1391040000,,462,4.518072289156627
5616511,5,B00BGGIWGG,Love it.  Bought for my 97 year old mom who grew up enjoying Lawrence Welk.  Now she gets to watch over and over and has a great time. Her care givers love it too.,1385942400,,163,3.764705882352941
5616512,5,B00BGGIWGG,"Streamed these for my elderly mother to watch and they are 3 very early, really classic episodes.
Mom really enjoyed them, so I'm giving them a 5 star rating.",1385769600,,158,4.482758620689655
5616513,3,B00BGGIWGG,Sound is good enough at times but too often it borders on being garbled.  Don't mind the B & W but it should at least be clear.  Digital re-mastering has been around for some time now!  The one's on PBS Sunday night are even in COLOR.  Can't you obtain some of those quality for us to view/buy?  This was viewed on Amazon Prime.,1379721600,,328,4.142857142857143
5616514,4,B00BGGIWGG,This was a walk down memory lane for me. Every Saturday night we had our hair in rollars and watched the Lawrence Welk Show. The Lennon Sisters were my favorite. I always wanted to play piano after seeing JoAnn Castle. I am happy to be able to see a show I watched as a kid.,1365465600,,274,4.0
5616515,2,B00BGGIWGG,Couldnt understand what makes these classic. Same fare. Same cast only younger. Lawrence's accent was not as evident in these earlier videos. Interesting.,1361491200,,154,5.739130434782608
5616516,2,B00BGGIWGG,"The show streamed perfectly fine but the sound was barely audible. This was with all volume settings maxed with PC and television. Didn't have problems with any other on demand videos so my best guess was the transcoding  didn't go as well as it should have. Since Lawrence Welk is all about the music, it left for an unsatisfactory experience.",1360454400,,344,4.733333333333333
5616517,5,B00BGGIWGG,"I bought the DVD for my Mom and was notified that I was able to watch it online, also.  I had said something to my Mom, but she said, ""Maybe later.""
I put it on anyway and she was hooked for all three episodes.  I did not watch the whole thing, but the picture was not that bad and the music sounded pretty clear. I love seeing these old black and white shows.  It takes me back to the days when I would stay over at my Grandmother's place on a Saturday night and Sunday morning, church.  Lawrence Welk was always on tv in on Saturday nights.  I got such joy today hearing my Mom singing along with the songs and laughing.  We watch PBS every Saturday evening to see this show.  I am not sure any generation is as loyal to anyone as these folks are to Lawrence Welk.  This was well worth the amount I paid and I have a few more coming too, so I know Mom will have hours of enjoyment  from them.",1358640000,3,894,4.005649717514125
5616518,4,B00BGGIWGG,Mom loves to view the episodes of yesteryear and my sisters enjoy watching it with her.  Would recommend to the older generation.,1356912000,,129,4.863636363636363

5616522,5,B00BGGIWGG,"I had forgotten that I originally heard the Whiffenpoof Song on Lawrence Welk, a weekly event in my home, when I was eight years old. You can learn more about the Whiffenpoof Song by googling it. The song, still performed annually by many groups including A Capella groups at Yale and other schools, has been around for over a century.

Lawrence Welk also was presented with a solid gold baton in the same episode by Dodge, one of the sponsors over the years.

The music is wonderful (think of ""Champagne Music"" and you've got an idea) and if you watched it at years ago, you'll love the soap bubbles all over again.

The price is wonderful (I'm watching it for free as part of Amazon Prime) and I hope you can still get the same ""price.""

I must admit that I have a bias in this matter. Before I was born, my mother was part of a trio that COULD have been featured on a show like Welk's, but she was before his time. The picture shows the Melodears Trio in the 1940's along with their travel friend and handyman after a rehearsal at St Marks Lutheran in Chicago. They traveled to many (or most) of the states east of the Mississippi, singing at schools and many other places. (Note, there are other groups that use the name Melodears [melody dears].) I've included their picture because Welk and the Melodears shared a love of the same music AND because two of the members of the Melodears were recognized (introduced) during one of the Welk Group's shows in Branson. I wish I still had that picture.",1443571200,,1501,4.447272727272727

5616528,5,B00BGGIWGG,It brought great memories to my elder care friends. Thanks for putting this online so they could once more enjoy the classic music of Lawrence Welk.,1411430400,,148,4.730769230769231
8568156,5,B00BGGIWGG,"So what happened to Americans?  Americans once were able to fight wars (and win them), sing, dance, play actual musical instruments, write actual music, not look like they subsisted on a diet of pure donuts, dress snappily, and produce beautiful and dignified women (instead of the type who rejoice in the claim that ""I'm a NASTY woman."").

These episodes were WAY before my time, but they certainly suggest that there were better days in America once.  You know, before about 1992?

There is more talent on display in any random 5 minutes of this film than there has been displayed in the entirety of Jay-Z's career.",1530835200,,617,4.7924528301886795
