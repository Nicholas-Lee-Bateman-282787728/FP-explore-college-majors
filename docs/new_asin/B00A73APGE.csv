This is a collection of homemade short films, but worth the buy and worth watching.",1399680000,,143,5.0
8547658,1,B00A73APGE,"Both of these Ultimate Zombie Feast collections advertise films on the covers that don't appear on the discs (Dead Hungry, It Came From The West, and Savages). I have the wonderful 'It Came From The West' on an old Region 2 dvd.  I thought it would be nice to have it on a Region 1 compilation but was disgusted to find that it had been dubbed over in English, in quite possibly the worst dub job I have ever seen in my life.  No attempt was made to sync the dialogue with the mouths of characters and sound effects come 15 seconds or so to either side of where they're supposed to be.  Not even bad enough to laugh at,  Just too bad to even suffer through.  Do not recommend.  At all.",1396396800,2,685,4.151515151515151
8547659,4,B00A73APGE,"Ultimate Zombie Feast is divided into 2 volumes. The trailer video on volume 1 is for both discs which total over 5 hours of film. Volume 1 has 2 hours and 47 minutes. This includes 9 independent short films. If you don't like one, wait for the next one. The 9 films feature:

1) Dutch beer zombies
2) Spanish mall zombies....Zombies in Spain? English subtitles.
3) London plague zombies not to be confused with the superior ""Cockneys vs. Zombies.""
4) Suicidal single mom heavy breather zombie
5) Death Metal factory, Fuddrucker loving, nail gun to the head zombie
6) Chained up love one zombie
7) Viral suburban axe zombies
8) Kid zombies (my favorite)
9) Utah Mormon zombies

Parental Guide: Most episodes include the F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1383264000,,745,4.767441860465116
