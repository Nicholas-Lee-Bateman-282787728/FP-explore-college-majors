5140965,5,B0089EKT9G,Powerful testimony!!!,1425081600,,21,10.0
5140966,5,B0089EKT9G,Love this short video about the testimony of Anita Keagy and how to seek God first.  I highly recommend it for the whole family to watch and to learn how to have joy in reading God's Word.  Written b: Mary SW,1422921600,2,208,4.048780487804878
5140967,5,B0089EKT9G,"I thought this was a drama, but it's a stand-up testimony.  I usually HATE those.  Anita Keagy is just wonderful in her delivery of this message - I really didn't feel preached at at all.  I found myself watching to find out what finally happened.  She's blunt about all the choices she had when she got pregnant, why she decided what she did, and how that played out in her life.  This is more like a radio program on video - simple and not much to it, but worth a listen all the same.",1416009600,3,486,4.127659574468085
5140968,5,B0089EKT9G,That wasn't what I expected at all but I am so glad I watched it to the end.,1414281600,3,76,3.2777777777777777
5140969,5,B0089EKT9G,This really blessed me in so many ways from how lovingly her parents responded to her pregnancy to all that the Lord showed her about Him and how He feels.  It was not what I expected but it was what I needed.  I thought it was a short movie but I'm so glad that I watched this testimony.,1413936000,2,288,3.9482758620689653
5140970,1,B0089EKT9G,"This is not a movie...it's just religious anti-abortion propaganda and a woman telling a story about herself being pregnant and choosing to have the kid. It shouldn't even be listed with regular movies, and should be more forthright about what it is. Thank goodness I didn't pay to watch it! Not recommended unless you are in the mood for preaching.",1413763200,4,349,4.833333333333333
5140971,5,B0089EKT9G,"superb testimony.  God bless you and your family, Anita",1412640000,,55,5.111111111111111

5140974,4,B0089EKT9G,I watched with interest the video. I was surprised to have a sales pitch at the end. I wish she had spoken more about her family in transition with adding her first child into the relationships.,1474243200,,194,4.416666666666667

5140979,5,B0089EKT9G,"Anita shares a captivating and touching story of the painful and selfless side of obedience to God for a greater good. She uses her experience, strength, and hope to lead you to an increased zeal for the letters written to you by God.",1472947200,,234,4.465116279069767

5140981,5,B0089EKT9G,"God is so good if we trust Him. That must have been a long journey for Anita and I wept because I too was a young mother. Trusting God has not always been easy but today my son serves God. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Anita, for sharing this story with us. What a wonderful testimony.",1472860800,,283,4.071428571428571

5140983,5,B0089EKT9G,"Pleasantly suprised by the content of this movie, testamony and not drama. God used it to speak to my heart in a very real way about knowing Him and being excited to know Him. So thankful for her ministry and Amazon for having so many encouraging and educational movies about spiritual growth and history of the church.",1471824000,,319,4.614035087719298

5140988,3,B0089EKT9G,"I thought this was going to be a movie. Instead, it's Anita Keagy speaking to a small group about her daughter she put up for adoption as a teenager. It's a very biblical discussion. Should have been under documentary.",1465603200,,218,4.615384615384615
5140989,5,B0089EKT9G,I thought I was going to watch this as an adoption story but it was more of just a great testimony with a message for every Christian. Very inspiring!,1464998400,,150,4.206896551724138
5140990,5,B0089EKT9G,This is a short (about 39+minutes) but heart-touching testimony of a woman who made an unusual mistake at end of high school and planning a move and starting college.  You cannot help but feel her emotions many years later during the talk.,1463788800,,239,4.690476190476191

5140999,5,B0089EKT9G,"This has surprised some viewers, as it is not a drama but a true story related in the first person.  The message is delivered to an audience with sincerity and is well-reasoned.  This could make a good discussion starter between parents and their teens on dating and the effects of unintended pregnancy.",1438732800,2,303,4.8076923076923075

8526324,3,B0089EKT9G,"It is always the female that bears the ""shame"" of an error in judgment.
