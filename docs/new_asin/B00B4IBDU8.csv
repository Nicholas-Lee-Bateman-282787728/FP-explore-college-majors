8562376,5,B00B4IBDU8,"my little girl started watching these dvd's at 8months old, while I made dinner and she played in her exersaucer. She learned to sign before she could speak her mind, and it really helped knowing what she wanted. I got these for a friend's baby and hopefully her little one will learn just as much.",1371081600,,298,4.4363636363636365
8562377,5,B00B4IBDU8,"This series is great for me and my daughter. We have volumes 1-4. We play a couple segments each day and have fun acting silly and doing signs. I also have the accompanying books and flash cards. It's nice to be able to use the flash cards for myself to learn signs that we have not yet watched on the video series. I then incorporate the signs into our dialogue throughout the day. The total video is pretty short and the individual segments are probably about 3-5 minutes long. If I had to describe the style of the series, I would say Blues Clues would be very similar. My favorite aspect of the series is the babies shown doing the signs in their own style. My daughter loves to watch other babies. Learning the signs is also made easier by the songs that are paired with them. I find myself humming these silly tunes later in the day, and I can't get them out of my head. The main adult in the series has blue and red tape on her fingers so that you can clearly see how to position specific fingers during the signs.

There is also a CD with signing time songs. I play that in the car usually.",1365897600,,1098,4.203791469194313
