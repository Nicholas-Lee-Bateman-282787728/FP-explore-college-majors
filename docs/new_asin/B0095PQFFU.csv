5270133,5,B0095PQFFU,"Watched on HBO last week and loved it - The editing and the sound were outstanding and will be award winning - Love the Stones and this gave me a whole new perspective on the band and in particular their music - The Rolling Stones are the world's first punk group - The early Stones were as punk as the Ramones, Pistols, Dolls, Clash or any other great punk band - Can't wait to watch this again and ""Charlie is my Darling"" for the first time = Very highly recommended to Stones and punk rock fans alike",1353369600,9,503,4.195876288659794
5270134,2,B0095PQFFU,"I watched this travesty (not quite) on HBO the other night.  As a long time Stones fan I was very excited.  What one gets is an unnarrated  pile of goo.  Voice overs by unidentified Stones is supposed to guide us through this endless stream of short clips.  Bits and pieces of songs are strung out for almost 2 hours without any attempt to provide context.  You don't get to hear any full performances and who knows which Stone is telling us NOTHING about what we are looking at?

Get the X-Pensive Winos at the Hollywood Palladium instead.  You'll have fun.",1353369600,16,558,4.51
8536203,5,B0095PQFFU,"Beautifully executed. Rare and very candid vignettes of backstage, dressing rooms, hotels, interviews etc! Well worth the $$ and downloading software to convert zone was a snap.",1362009600,,177,5.592592592592593
8536204,5,B0095PQFFU,"I saw a couple comments about the compatibility of the discs to play on US players, and it's ok.  It has a couple burps but it works. Sound is great, excellent experience.",1360713600,,171,4.34375
8536205,3,B0095PQFFU,"I could not WAIT for this to show on HBO! While it was somewhat interesting, I came away from it not knowing too much more about these guys than I did going in.  There are some great clips here and there - always good, but when the show was over, I was left wanting more: more detail and more of who these people are.

I will use the example of the other big relatively recent musician documentary, the one Martin Scorcese did about George Harrison.  A HUGE Harrison fan, I went in knowing a great deal and left having an even more well-rounded, fuller picture of who George was and how he created.  As enjoyable as the clips and music in Crossfire Hurricane, this doc did little to do the same for the Rolling Stones.

The part surrounding Brian Jones' death was appreciated and illuminating, but it still felt incomplete.

These guys are bigger than life to a whole lot of us, but this film felt more like a bad Bob Dylan bio - and nothing was revealed.

The good news is that this film sent me back to the vinyl to listen to some Stones music I had not listened to in a long time.  I went back to December's Children... and Flowers and Between the Buttons and the Rolling Stones Now and Out of Our Heads and 12x5 and Beggars Banquet and of course, Aftermath.  I have bought a lot of Stones cd compilations, but hadn't listened to lots of those albums beginning to end in years.  The movie made me want to go back and re-discover all of that great music - which is, after all, why we still care after 50 years!",1360195200,,1512,4.255244755244755
8536206,4,B0095PQFFU,"When I heard that the Stones had given their permission and co-operation for ""Crossfire"" I was expecting a lot more. While there's not much in it that I don't like...It's just too short. There's also several important events not mentioned. For example, while the famous Redlands bust and subsequent trial is well covered, the two arrests and trials of Brian Jones are not even mentioned! Also the vision of the Stones in the studio supposedly hearing of Jones' death was, as all Stones fans know, filmed several months after his death in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Pretty lazy film-making there.
Another important person in the bands story is founder member Ian Stewart, and I may have to go back over it, but is he even mentioned?
The other oddity is that the film suddenly ends in 1981. I know that their best music was behind them but come on, nothing from the last 31 years? In my opinion the DVD release should have much more in terms of interviews, complete song performances, whether they be TV, film clips, or live tracks. All in all it's very good...but it should have been great. Two hours for 50 years of the greatest rock'n'roll band of them all is not nearly enough.",1359244800,,1176,4.658653846153846
8536207,5,B0095PQFFU,if you tired of seeing the same old footage (even though its great) then you will want this. Almost all of the footage presented here has been unreleased. Really good if you feel like being nostalgic and want to relive Altamont.,1355097600,,228,4.585365853658536
8536208,5,B0095PQFFU,"This is a great story... Very well done and I learned a lot about their early years... While the Beatles were getting chased by screaming girls... the Stones were getting attacked by men right on stage... The downfall on Brian Jones and his last days at the recording studio were documented well... and the images of how drugs just destroyed him were very sad and frustrating.

There is some great music on this as well. Good mix of music and ""story.""",1354838400,2,451,4.567901234567901
8536209,4,B0095PQFFU,"Like many reviewers here, my take on the HBO version (which ran about 110 minutes) is that what was there was really good; the disappointment was that in this year of their much-ballyhood 50th anniversary (The tour! The CD! The book ! The t-shirt!) the version we saw pretty much cuts off at mid-way point, leaving the last 25 years or so quite literally untouched.

Now, neither me nor anybody else is going to tell you that the second half of the chronology makes for as good a story - or soundtrack - as the first half, but ""facts is facts"". And the lead tracks from the later albums did make for some hits along the way, and certainly the accompanying videos for those songs (and from the many ensuing tours, including the very interesting ""Stripped"" shows) could definitely flesh out another 60-90 minutes without diluting the overall story.

Based on amazon.co.uk listing, the DVD is supposed to be 142 minutes. Hopefully, this extra footage extends to the period from ""Tattoo You"" to the present to give us the full span.",1354406400,8,1028,4.6740331491712706
8536210,5,B0095PQFFU,"Amazon has this listed as ""Region B/2"" which is for blu-rays released in Europe and coded to play in European players.
If this is true this won't play in the United States.  The region code for blu-rays released in the US should be A/1.",1354233600,7,236,4.363636363636363
8536211,5,B0095PQFFU,"This is better than the Scorsese deal. This is a/the real documentary. Top of the line. You feel like you are with them. What a trip.
In every aspect this nails what the Stones are about. Where they came from, the journey, and they just love the pirate adventure out at sea. Ultimately they make you feel good, want you to feel good and they just keep on Rollin'.",1353628800,5,363,4.27536231884058
8536212,4,B0095PQFFU,"I'm giving it four stars to start with because I haven't finished watching it. There are some tremendous insights -- the one from Bill Wyman about how the Stones ""wobble"" is awesome, and Mick's insights about the insanity of fame are quite valuable after all these years. But there's at least one moment when footage of a historic incident -- the classic recording session at Muscle Shoals, as seen in ""Gimme Shelter"" -- is used to illustrate another historic occurrence -- the death of Brian Jones (""we were in the studio when we first heard about Brian""). That's pretty lazy filmmaking if you ask me. Considering all of the unreleased footage the director had access to, you'd think he'd be able to come up with something better for that segment.

Another terrific observation comes from Keith, who calls the early Stones ""perverted anarchists."" For better or ill, there is way more perversion on tap than usual in this film, and while that gives us a deeper look at what made these guys go, it's not necessarily fun to behold and sure ain't family viewing (I realize the irony of that last sentiment).

 I find myself wondering what the point of this latest ""victory lap"" (NYT writer Pareles' apt phrase for what the Stones have been doing since 1989) is. I have the same problem with Grrrr, the latest greatest hits collection. Hasn't this story already been very well-told?

All that said, I may still buy the DVD when it comes out because I bet it'll have more stuff on it.

- - -

Upon further review, I'm sticking with this -- it's a unique document because the commentary is most definitely from within the band, and said commentary is really more about the artists than the art. From that standpoint this has its value because you really get an idea of how these guys felt while in a pretty unique position. But it's not always fun to watch or hear -- hate to say that, love as I do these boys' output over a massively great career. But a lot of this does not look like fun.",1353542400,4,1984,4.543417366946779
