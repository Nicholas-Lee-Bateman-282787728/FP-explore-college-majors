A Review of Sensei Morris's Double DVD set by Maziar Kakhi (Washington DC Shotokan Karate Club).

Kanku-Dai is the longest Kata in the Shotokan system and its study is particularly important because it can be considered as a hub for many of the techniques found in other Shotokan Katas. This also means that understanding the principles of the Bunkai behind the major Waza in Kanku-Dai opens numerous doors towards a clearer interpretation of related moves found in other Kata.

Sensei Morris points out that the current double DVD set supersedes its predecessor in order to account more adequately for the `rules of combat'. These rules are a set of principles that apply to any martial art (whose primary objective is self-defense, not competitive sport) and when adhered to, ensure that any technically plausible interpretation of the Kata moves is rendered combat effective. If it isn't combat effective, it will only work in the Dojo under simulated (and invariably unrealistic) conditions.

Describing this DVD set as an `odyssey of Kata application' is an apt characterization due to the breadth of ground that is covered. The various applications for just the opening (signature) move of the Kata take up the first twenty minutes of disc 1 and focus on the flinch reflex response which typifies the so-called `Kanku-Dai paradigm'. This also highlights how inappropriate it is to dismiss the opening move as merely a ""salutation"" or ""greeting"", as described in certain publications devoted to Bunkai(see for example: Hidden Karate II, Gennosuke Higaki, Taiyo Publishing Co. Page 106. [...]).

Sensei Morris's approach to teaching Bunkai incorporates a unifying theme by virtue of the rules of combat. For example, ""once you gain control, you never give it back again"" constitutes the guiding principle for all of the drills where a joint lock is performed. As Sensei Morris points out in his seminars, the Kata moves are symbolic and their Bunkai should be interpreted as a box of tools that by no means have to be applied sequentially to satisfy the step-by-step choreography of the Kata. In other words, it's perfectly acceptable to apply two sets of Bunkai in one drill stemming from moves at the start and the end of a Kata, as long as it takes care of business efficiently. Furthermore, it is essential to add Ko-Waza (e.g. head butts, slaps, eye gouges, elbow/knee strikes, etc.), where appropriate, to ensure that the (major) O-Waza can be applied in a real-life situation.

Hip/shoulder/neck throws, take-downs, arm bars, joint locks and thigh kicks (a non-exhaustive list!) occur repeatedly in different applications. By way of example, I will refer to the straight punch, inside block combination near the beginning of the Kata (Choku-zuki, Uchi-uke). One application scenario assumes the assailant grabs your lapel and is preparing to strike you with the other (free) arm. As always, all of Sensei Morris's applications make use of at least one or more rules of combat. In this case, the primary response is to shift to the side (at 45 degrees) from the danger posed by the assailant's free arm which is ready to strike. At the same time, the Choku-zuki is enhanced by use of Nakadaka-ken-zuki (middle finger knuckle strike) either to the floating ribs or the solar plexus. This straightens the assailant's grabbing arm and exposes the lung-5 pressure point. The innocuous `Uchi-uke' in the Kata is interpreted, at first, as a strike to the lung-5 pressure point. This naturally forces the assailant's posture to be compromised and, in turn, exposes the side of his neck. Consequently, the drill instantly follows-up with an immediate strike to the gall bladder 20 or large/small intestine points on the neck. None of the moves in this drill are redundant. Furthermore, they each depend on the successful execution of their predecessor, and if performed correctly lead to a knock-out very quickly and with little effort on the part of the defender. The final strike to the neck is likened to the opening move in Bassai-Dai. This exemplifies Sensei Morris's understanding of Bunkai as a holistic body of knowledge and reinforces the observation he makes in his Nijushiho DVD, namely, that you don't need to know a multitude of Katas to perform good effective applications. The same applications are very often seen over and over again.

To go into the detail of all the various Bunkai conveyed in this double DVD set would transform this review into a very long thesis. It makes much more sense to watch the DVDs. I highly recommend it to any serious practitioner of Karate who aspires to understand how his/her `martial art' is worthy of that designation.
