2421813,4,B000BKDO98,"House Of Fury is almost superb and that is the most disappointing thing about this film.  Teddy Yu (Anthony Wong) leads a double life as a chiropractor and secret agent.  His teenaged children, Nicky (Stephen Fung, who also directed the film) and Natalie (Gillian Chung from the pop group Twins) think his 007 stories are all nonsense.  When Teddy is kidnapped by assasins who work for a man named Rocco (Michael Wong from Beast Cops),the kung fu kids search for the baddies.  Rocco is after Teddy's longtime friend Chiu (Ma Wu) and his killers are tough. Rocco, on the other hand is the weakest character in the movie.  On the disc cover, he's in a fighting stance with Wolverine-like claws.  In the movie, he's a wheelchair bound crybaby who is paralyzed from the neck down.  Rocco's young son, Nelson (newcomer Jake Strickland) is the baddest ass on the evil team.  This kid is awesome and is one of the main reasons to buy this dvd.  Daniel Wu (Cop On A Mission, One Nite In Mongkok) and Charlene Choi (the other Twin) are entertaining, but they don't do too much here.  Overall, House Of Fury is a nice reminder of the way kung fu movies used to be in the 70's and 80's.  With Yuen Woo Ping, Jackie Chan's production team, Stephen Fung, and the great cast involved, it should have been a classic.",1137196800,7,1301,4.540772532188841
2421814,3,B000BKDO98,"This movie had some good fight scenes, but those were marred by the fantasy wire-fu HK likes to throw in their films nowadays.  Gah, it's irritating to see some guy floating across the screen his legs flailing.  I know it's part of Chinese fiction/fantasy, but people *can't fly*.  Why do they associate martial arts mastery with having supernatural powers?  Bruce Lee must be rolling in his grave.

Wire-fu aside, some of the fight scenes were pretty good.  The story was halfway decent, although there's a problem with the pendants the kids were wearing since childhood; they didn't have flash cards when the children were young.  They didn't exist.  That whole concept was flawed.  The villian was lame.  A vendetta over getting paralyzed by a covert operative.  Why is it that they show the guy on the front of the DVD standing?  I don't get it.  Where's the consistency?

I'd like to see more attention to plot and non-wire-fu action instead of a corny plot with huge holes and guys that fly.",1135900800,2,997,4.754385964912281
2421815,5,B000BKDO98,"House of Fury is a return to the older style of Martial Arts film.  While there are some scenes where it's notably done with wires (only really obvious in the opening sequence) the rest of the fights are reminiscent of what you would have seen in the 80's and early 90's.

The story of the film is pretty original, but has its cliche moments.  But that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable overall.

But honestly, the fights are what make this movie.  Any Kung Fu or Martial Arts fan who enjoys the movies with a lot of amazing fight sequences will love House of Fury.  They where directed by martial arts action supremo Yuen Woo Ping (The Matrix Trilogy, Kill Bill 1 & 2) who has once again proved why he's one of the best in the business.

All in all, House of Fury is a great buy for a Kung Fu film fanatic, or someone looking for a good action movie with some humor thrown in.  The story isn't the strongest, but with well choreographed fights, well placed humor, and some great acting performances by the younger characters in the movie, House of Fury is one of the best films to come out of Hong Kong in 2005, and one of the better films in recent years.",1135468800,6,1160,4.2889908256880735
2421816,2,B000BKDO98,"somehow, this movie manages to have certain mainstream elements and also shows signs of a B-movie. some of the fighting scenes are worthy and the plot is semi ok. this movie was pretty hype when it first came out here in the USA, but after buying the dvd, i was not impressed. the ending, the last scene after the finale fight, how bad guy gets caugh. the bad guy does something that i laughed my rear end off. (think wheelchair and wall)..im not gonna say much more here and give it all away, but each time i rewound that part, i simply could not stop laughing, because it was so stupid and yet kinda/can/could be real or happen. hehehehehe, geez, im laughing already now just telling you guys about it.

but yes, watch it, don't expect to see a masterpiece.",1133395200,2,759,4.421428571428572
2421827,4,B000BKDO98,"I was looking for my first Hong Kong movie on blu-ray to add to my collection, and this was the one.  Great movie and what can I say - Gillian Chung is hot.",1331078400,,156,3.727272727272727
2421828,2,B000BKDO98,"After seeing Stephen Fung in Gen X Cops,I decided to see this movie. I thought it would be good since it was produced by Jackie Chan but it was not so. It was boring,the characters weren't that intresting and they had some ridiculous scenes like floating/flying from the top of one building to the next. It also has an unitentionally funny scene at the end involving the bad guy in the wheelchair. The fight scenes were also unrealistic and if this movie was supposed to have some comedic elements in it,I missed it. I'm also not a fan of that wuxia martial arts. Maybe if your a teenage boy or younger you might like this movie otherwise I say skip it.",1327276800,,653,4.404958677685951

2421830,2,B000BKDO98,"excellent movie; however the movie did not come in its original package, but a clear plastic holder.  I do recommend buying from this vendor.",1255478400,,141,4.875
2421831,5,B000BKDO98,Great movie.  I which they would come out with a part two.  I really loved the martial arts and the actors and actress.  Loved it and so will anyone that buys this movie.  I highly recommend this one.,1241827200,,200,4.184210526315789
2421832,4,B000BKDO98,"House of Fury dosen't quite live up to its title. At its heart it's a family movie with special effects! It's not a bad movie! It's just good if and only under these conditions: 1) You have nothing else to watch., 2) You're entertaining children and you need something to keep their attention., and 3) Your looking for something to laugh at and also go to sleep with.",1234828800,,367,4.411764705882353
2421833,5,B000BKDO98,"I'll start by saying that House of Fury is a very fun movie with some really great action. If you like kung fu movies with good fights and a decent plot, you should enjoy this movie greatly. I rented this movie when it first came out on DVD a while back. It must have not made a very good first impression on me because I didn't buy it. But recently I decided to go ahead and pick it up, and I must say I am very happy I did. This movie was a lot better than I remember it being the first time I watched it. For some reason I remembered the story being a little slow and short on action. WRONG! This flick totally kicks butt! I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. The main villain is a little lame, but the kid playing his son is awesome with a bo staff, so I can overlook a little wooden acting. All-in-all I give this one two thumbs up!!! Check it out, you won't be sorry.",1212364800,,888,4.022598870056497
2421834,4,B000BKDO98,"This was an enjoyable movie with a nice balance of action, comedy and plot. It was done in the true fashion of 'Shaolin Soccer' and has very nice special effects blended into the fight scenes. I wish the 'last fight scene' was done better, but overall still a great movie to add to your collection, if only for the jokes alone. =P",1186876800,,330,4.338709677419355
2421835,3,B000BKDO98,A good family martial arts movie for the kids to watch. Also in english.,1170892800,,72,4.214285714285714
2421836,4,B000BKDO98,"`House of Fury' is a quite entertaining kung-fu action film that does not take itself seriously. It nicely re-uses the basic story of Robert Rodriguez's joyful `Spy Kids' series, and adds lots of well-choreographed kung-fu actions (advisor Yuen Woo Ping).

Anthony Wong (`Infernal Affair') is Yue Siu Bo, a middle-aged doctor who runs his own health clinic in Hong Kong. He is a good-natured person and a family man, but his habitual tales about his old days as martial arts master and top spy agent are very embarrassing for his children, Nicky (Stephen Fung, also director of the film) and Natalie (Gillian Chung, `The Twins Effect' and one of the popular duo Twins). Nicky and Natalie do not believe a single word of his father's braggadocio until one day he is really kidnapped by a baddie in wheelchair, Rocco (Michael Wong) who showed up before him to settle the score with the guy who inflicted a severe injury to him many years ago.

The story is thus simple, but it works in this kind of action-packed film. Though helped by stunts, smooth editing, and some wires, all the martial arts actions are above average, generating enough excitement and fun with the characters' super-fast, gravity-defying movements. I will not be surprised to find the good action from Josie Ho who plays a deadly assassin, but it is surprising that Gillian Chung can show good skills as kung-fu fighter, who has obviously trained so much since `The Twins Effect.'

Charlene Choi (the other Twin) also appears, but sadly her role is just an extended cameo. Daniel Wu also appears, but his fans would be disappointed with his role which does not play a significant role until one moment. On the other hand, veteran Wu Ma steals the scenes with some good (and you might say unbelievable) actions, and Jake Strickland as the baddie's son (who is always playing Nintendo) also shines in two scenes where he shows his true colors as capable fighter.

Of course this is not `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' or `Kung-hu Hustle.' Stephen Fung as directo knows what he is doing, with his approach which is very orthodox, and even simple in letting his co-stars show what they can do on the screen. No grace and beauty of bamboo trees, no gimmicks and parodies. Only good martial arts actions, and they are very entertaining. Recommended for the fans of martial arts actions, or the sweet and lovely Twins.",1153699200,2,2382,4.816625916870415
8087940,4,B000BKDO98,This movie has some wonderful choreography. The sibling rivalry between Nicky & Natalie plays nicely and Anthony Wong is outstanding as the seemingly Magoo-ish father that dotes on his kids. The villain is the weakest element here but I loved this film enough to buy an imported copy for lack of a Region 1 blu ray.,1522108800,,315,4.642857142857143
8087941,3,B000BKDO98,Its a family movie with good amount  of action not what i expected but at least it wasn't horrible it got 3 stars for the fight scenes,1519344000,,134,3.962962962962963

8087948,5,B000BKDO98,"When I first started to watch this movie I thought that I had made a mistake, but I continued to watch it and it became a lot better as the movie progressed.  In the end I really liked it.  It was heartwarming, had action and the good guys come out in the end with the bad guys going down.",1352678400,,289,3.8813559322033897
8087949,4,B000BKDO98,This was an above average action flick with plenty of high quality fight scenes. The plot was slightly similar to a movie on HBO caleed Safe House (featuring Patrick Stuart of Star Trek-TNG). Well worth the money and an excellent addition for martial arts fans. You shouldn't be disappointed .,1339286400,,293,4.88
