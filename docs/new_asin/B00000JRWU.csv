1237345,5,B00000JRWU,"Tie-Died is an excellent documentary of the ""deadicated"" fans of the Grateful Dead.  The film makers travel with the fans during Summer of 1994 (which as it turns out is the penultimate Summer Tour for the Grateful  Dead).  It does not discuss the band at all, but rather gives the other  experience of being at a show, the lot.  This movie relays the experience  of traveling with deadheads between shows, the parking lot experience  before the show, and the scene after the show.  It is sometimes touching,  sometimes crazy, sometimes angry in-depth look at those who allowed the  Dead to go on it's 30-year long strange trip.",945734400,6,628,4.785046728971962
1237346,4,B00000JRWU,"I was pleasantly surprised by this well-rounded documentary that takes the viewer along on the band's final(?) summer tour. Almost no time spent on the band itself. Examines a good cross-section of heads which include a  t-shirt vendor, medic, bootlegger, families on tour, young heads, old  heads, a VW bus mechanic, and many for which there is no classification.  Shows us the warm fuzzy side as well as the ugly side of the scene. If you  were there, wish you'd been there, wish you were still there, or just want  to know what this scene was all about, check out this video.",937267200,4,578,4.627450980392157

7913293,3,B00000JRWU,"Lot's of fun on the road with the merriest of pranksteresque young
vagabonds.  I lived through this scene and transversed many a Shakedown
Street enclave,  This film gives you an up-front and personal peek into
the scene, as it was.  The lack of appropriate music, though, is a hard road
to travel.",1382659200,,298,4.6923076923076925
7913294,5,B00000JRWU,"I had seen this movie when it it 1st came out and had totally forgotten about it. When I saw available I had to pick it up and revisit my days on tour. I would highly recommend this for those who toured and those who did not and also for anyone who wants to get a peek at what us Dead Heads we up to while following Jerry and boys around. Certainly I would agree with other reviewers that this definitely provides a look into the darker side of things that could happen while on tour. I think that is what makes this an accurate depiction of what went on. There were old timers (traveling with Dead since the 60s) younger generation and then of course as with any community the less than desirables. With that said check it out but ensure you are properly regulated to really bring you back to the scene.

And what about the Rasta girl.....ride mighty high!!

Let there be music to fill the air....and btw there is no GD music in this film but lots of drums from the circles.",1308268800,,975,4.236559139784946
7913295,5,B00000JRWU,"We watched this movie when it came out, several years ago. Friends threw a tye-dye shirt making party and then we watched this movie.  It is an interesting collection of interviews and very varied perspectives of the scene. But, for us, a special bonus was that my wife and I are walking around in the background of one of the scenes in a shakedown lot. This movie was hard to find and I was glad to finally find it and now own it.",1298160000,,431,4.192771084337349
7913296,3,B00000JRWU,trying to capture something as wonderful as the world created around the dead by there loving fans is no easy task and not in my opinion shown very well in this atempt  yes every thing you see is reminisant of little corners of the dead world an enteresting look at world that no longer exsists  and for those of you who unfortuantly wernt there just know while this gives a small glimpse just a mere scratch of the surface that those of us who were there sadly will recoginize  and miss in this film .  still an historical record none the less  to be at least to be seen as such,1146268800,3,579,4.18018018018018
7913297,4,B00000JRWU,"A Great film about the people who follow the Grearful Dead.

7913298,2,B00000JRWU,"This movie was a big disappointment. In some sense it shows the worst of the scene that followed the Dead in their latter days. It's noteworthy that there's _no_ music by The Grateful Dead in it - I understand they refused to allow any. However, the short extra at the end, "" A Conversation with Ken Kesey"" is one of the clearest and most concise expressions of what the Acid Trips, and the Grateful Dead/Jerry Garcia at their best, were about.",1137715200,,444,4.493827160493828
7913299,4,B00000JRWU,"I just saw this on ...TV and I was really surprised to see something like this on television to begin with. I am not a Deadhead (but do enjoy the lifestyle of many of them), but Tie-Died: Rock's Most Deadicated Fans is, for the most part, an excellent documentary that shows life at a parking lot before a Grateful Dead concert. Plus it plainly shows that the countercultural scene was still alive and well in the grunge and alternative rock dominated culture of the mid 1990s. But just be careful not to believe everything these people being interviewed are saying. On numerous occasions, I found what they were saying a bit insincere, but there were still quite a few people who not only sounded very sincere, but had very valid things to say. They seemed to put a large emphasis on the under 18 crowd, for some reason (although they interview enough people who were old enough to been there in the 1960s, to not be totally biased), perhaps because people are surprised that they'd chose this lifestyle, instead of the grunge/alternative rock lifestlye. The documentary also showed a few people who were becoming disillusioned with the lifestyle, which I don't blame them if they keep getting bad vibes, in fact that's the one thing that brought down the original countercultural movement by 1970 (like the Altamont riots in December 1969, and Kent State in 1970), and you could tell from watching Tie-Died, that that attitude could bring down the current generation of hippies (which it did come 1999 with the disgraceful, greed-driven event known as Woodstock '99). So basically you get a combination of good and bad vibes throughout the documentary. But there were some fundamentalist Christians as well in the film, three guys with beards, if I remember right, who were trying to convert some of the kids to Christianity. They liked to brag on the success they had, but there's no proof. Another disturbing thing was someone mentioned how much jail time you would serve for just a gram of LSD, and that multiplies for each gram you have. Makes you wonder if America is really a democracy, or a police state after you hear what was said on the documentary. Because of the increase of undercover police officers, people advised never to buy and sell LSD at a Dead concert. I have some objections to this film. They tended to make the hippies (particularly the young, under 18 crowd) as completely stoned and unbathed, but liked to show the older hippies (the ones who have been with the Dead since the beginning) as sober and clean. In other words, it would have been much nicer if they showed some of the younger people a little more with it. Basically this documentary won't give outsiders (non-hippies) any better opinions about hippies, although I'm glad to see that the cops you see were rather surprised how little trouble these people at the Dead concert created. Plus I'd like it better if they also included some footage of the Dead playing, and historical footage as well, to compare the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, with the 1990s. This documentary is also a sad reminder that these were some of the last Dead shows before the untimely death of Jerry Garcia. I took a star off just because of some of the flaws (and the occasional stereotyping of hippies), but it's still a great documentary on the counterculture movement, the way it was in the 1990s.",1021593600,2,3359,4.743589743589744
7913300,4,B00000JRWU,"If ever there was an anti-drug film, this is it, without even trying to be.  The young women obviously strung out on ecstasy are complete dolts.  Did the hippies have ecstasy?  The sober people who also enjoyed the Grateful Dead concert were very clear headed and talked about how much better the experience was without drugs.  Since drugs contributed to many Dead deaths over the years, it is amazing that some people think they must enjoy the music by getting high.  Think about how much better life in general would be with all of your faculties on go.  The video is very good, except for the tacked on ""A Conversation with Ken Kesey,"" which just has him rambling into the camera.",982800000,2,683,4.603305785123967
