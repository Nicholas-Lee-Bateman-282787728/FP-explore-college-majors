8112920,3,B000EQ608Q,"This DVD spans Lana Lane's career, with songs from all her albums. The music is decent and the band technically proficient, but the performance comes across as a bit uninspired for the most part. The picture and sound quality are mediocre, though in all fairness the budget for the DVD probably wasn't that high (though there are other low budget concert DVDs with better picture and sound). One thing that annoyed me was that the picture was in 'letterbox' format, but my DVD player didn't recognize it as a widescreen picture, so you end up with a small rectangle in the middle of a widescreen TV unless you use the TV's zoom function (which tends to reduce the picture quality further) - if you're filming in widescreen, you should make it a proper widescreen DVD.",1154304000,,767,4.688888888888889
8112921,5,B000EQ608Q,"This is a must-have for Lana fans, as it contains stunning live performances of songs that span her career.  Taking tracks from every album, her ""Euro"" band expertly blasts through flawless renditions of her music in a celebration of her 10 years as a recording and performing artist.

It's also a perfect introduction for newcomers to her melodic brand of symphonic rock.",1147219200,,372,4.983870967741935
