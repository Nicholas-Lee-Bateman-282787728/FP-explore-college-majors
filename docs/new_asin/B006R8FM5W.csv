8503502,5,B006R8FM5W,"The Thousand Hands Buddha meditation done in the morning always leaves me feeling very relaxed and uplifted and my mind feels clear and calm for the rest of the day. Recently I did a 40 minute session in the half lotus. After 30 minutes my legs were getting numb and it felt painful. About a minute later, I felt a rush of energy go into my legs and then the pain vanished and my legs felt comfortable. That is the first time that has ever happened. I've done 40 minute meditation sessions of other types of meditation in the past but it has always been difficult because of the pain and sometimes I would just have to stop. The instructions are clear but I had to watch some movements several times before I could imitate them. Because there are twelve different hand postures, boredom isn't an issue. I highly recommend this style of meditation.  As for the self massage segment, I haven't tried it yet so I can't comment on it.",1456876800,,930,4.43859649122807
