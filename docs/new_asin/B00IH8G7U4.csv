8642087,5,B00IH8G7U4,"With a panel of six participants a thorough explanation is presented in this video of the highly addictive nature of crystal meth. The behaviors are explained and family involvement is discussed. The denial and fear from a parents perspective is shared as well as some options for parents to help themselves.

The video shares the importance of the spiritual aspect which can be vital to long-term recovery. It reminds us that everyone is affected by a family members meth use and it stresses the importance of each family member engaging in their own recovery.

I would highly recommend this video to any family members or friends of someone who is struggling with drug use. It gives solid information from an experienced panel about crystal meth which can be applied to any drug use, as well as reminds us that there is hope. Recovery is possible!
