411718,2,6302025230,"This is a horror/thriller about a killer running amok during a movie marathon.  The idea behind the movie is sort of cool and ahead of its time, being that is was released in theaters in 1989. I think that is the only real positive thing I can say about this film. As far as acting goes, the movie stars Jill Schoelen and Tom Villard as the main charecters, and the acting is terrible and unconvincing.  Also, the movie is not scary at all, in fact they try to make it funny by adding jokes. This is definitly not for the hard core horror fan, but maybe fans of the Scream and Urban Legend type of horror movies might find something special in this movie. As for quality, it made a good transition to DVD, although a bit grainy in some scenes.  The sound is also decent throughout most of the movie.  One thing it could have used is more extras added to the DVD.",989712000,5,862,4.237804878048781

Way to ruin the suspense, babe.  Anyways, the possesor film (a film shown in the movie)scared me more than Popcorn, itself, did.  But I must admit I'm shocked about the price.

411792,4,6302025230,"I had been looking for Popcorn on DVD for quite awhile. I'm so glad I kept checking back and found it at a reasonable price. As for the film, I love how campy it is and how they take the ""Killer with a mask"" to a different level. I thought the idea of a cursed film helped to push the story along, but did not take the comedy out of the movie itself. It was an important plot point, and needed to be there for the story to unfold. The kills themselves were fun and I most certainly enjoyed the movies within the movie. How can anyone not like a peek at  the 50's horror movies from the past. Not to mention the promotion gags that would make William Castle proud.

WRONG! This movie is fantastic, and every bit as fantastic 20 years later. Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but the English version (as in UK) is less expensive and well worth the money. (Two thumbs up.)

Its looks to be incomplete, budget problems, scheduleing deadlines to get it rushed into post production, all the makeings that falls in the catagory of b-movie but more higher quality. Has promise but once the villain is revealed towards the end and has most of the screen time, the movie falls short with its campyness.

411796,3,6302025230,"Popcorn (Mark Herrier, 1991)

I've been thinking off and on for a while about the meteoric rise of direct-to-video as a popular distribution medium in the mid-nineties and whether it is ultimately a good thing. It's kind of a tough call, because while DtV has obviously made it much easier for amateur directors to get their work out there (save DtV, how would we have ever heard about such luminaries as Brian Paulin, who's making some of the most fun horror movies that have come down the pike in the last decade?), it's also curtailed the theatrical releases of minor-but-fun horror flicks like Popcorn, a 1991 slasher flick that's no one's idea of timeless cinema, but that's a barrel of monkeys when you finally get around to sitting down and watching it. I'm sure you've noticed the corresponding rise of the big-budget remake in the Hollywood horror industry; there are times when it seems like well over half of the horror flicks Hollywood puts out are remakes. (At one point I estimated four in five horror movies coming out of Hollywood were remakes, ""reboots"", or mindless sequels; that may be a little harsh, but think about all the horror films that got released through the big studios in 2009. You can see whence my depression stems.) What gets relegated to the little ""indie""arms of the studios, or direct to video, are films exactly like Popcorn. And finally, I think that hurts more than it helps. I mean, what would you rather go see at the theater some Saturday night, a fun little flick containing no one you've ever heard of that may be crap--but may also be genius--or Saw XVII? (If your answer is the latter, you probably shouldn't be reading this review.)

Plot: a bunch of college kids attempting to raise money decide to put on an all-night horror-fest in order to raise money. They get a bunch of props relating to the films they're showing (all bad fifties B films, all fictional but obviously based on William Castle gimmick flicks) from local movie memorabilia merchandiser Mnesyne (Ray Walston in a wonderful cameo). In one of the trunks, they find a reel of film. It turns out to be a short called The Possessor, the infamous final short from cult director Lanyard Gates (Mat Falls, a make-up artist who worked on the 1992 version of Dracula, among others). The professor who sponsors the club tells them the tale--Gates had gone insane, and planned on acting out the final scene of the film live, killing his family and burning down the theater after locking the doors. The theater burned, to be sure, but Gates' body was never found. Needless to say, when the horrorfest goes on, a slasher who may or may not be Gates starts bumping off club members one by one...

If you don't go into this expecting a great movie, you'll have a lot of fun with it. The script was written by Alan Ormsby (Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things), though he recused himself and is credited under another name after he was pulled out of the directors' chair three weeks into filming and replaced with Mark Herrier in his only directorial feature (he's best known as an actor from the Porky's franchise). IMDB trivia tells us that Lanyard Gates' character was based loosely on Jose Mojica Marins (he of the Coffin Joe films), but if you watch The Possessor, it becomes immediately apparent that whoever did the filming of that bit, whether it was Ormsby or Herrier, was quite familiar with both Kenneth Anger and Stan Brakhage. The acting is good enough, and there's quite a list of minor B-film stalwarts here, inclusing Jill Schoelen, Kelly Jo Minter, Toby Roberts, Karen Witter, and the always-indomitable Dee Wallace. Herrier does a competent job with the direction, which makes me wonder why he was never tapped to do it again (he's done a couple of shorts since, but no features). A fun little flick worth catching on the late-night creature feature if you stumble across it, since you probably missed it the first time; IMDB reports that the box office was so dismal that the movie went straight to second-run theaters in many markets. That's a shame; it's a great deal more fun than the majority of horror movies we've gotten from Hollywood in the past decade. ***",1294963200,,4189,4.727770177838577

The bonus features on the DVD include some of the ""Popcorn"" movies trailers and t.v. spots, a lot of them. For some reason lots of people complain about the ""video transfer"" on this dvd, if you have the authentic version of the film, you will notice the quality is near perfect and is presented in widescreen, buyer beware as I have seen a cheap bootleg copy being sold. The dvd also comes with a ""Scene Index"" / ""Chapter Guide"" insert inside the case.

The movie itself is very interesting and has a great campy story line. Without giving away too much of the story... A group of film students reopen an old movie theater that is soon to be torn down in a few weeks, so the class must rush and put on one of the best all night horror movie shows. They soon learn that the theater has a gruesome past that may once again occur the same way it did years ago (the last act of a movie to be played out ""live"" on stage). The movie has great music and I really enjoy the lighting in the movie as I really don't see it that much in newer horror films.

From the DVD & VHS versions I noticed one line in the movie was changed near the beginning, anyone else notice that too?",1276819200,,1242,4.236286919831223

First time I saw this film I was blown away,it was actually pretty dark and diverse plot-wise,the acting was very good,the film score by Paul J.

Recently, ive been buying movies that ive always wanted to see and this was one of them. I loved the tag ine of the movie too-Buy a bag, go home in a box. This movie was perfect in every sense-the concept, the story, the atomsphere, the timing. The characters were even good, a rare thing in horror films since they all usually follow the same cliche. I enjoyed the end, even though the villian looked and acted like Freddy Krurger. All in all, get this movie if your a horror fan. It was excellent film and highly recommend it.",1214352000,3,635,4.389830508474576
411834,4,6302025230,"""Buy A Bag....Go Home In A Box"" has got to be one of the best horror film taglines of all time.  Unfortunately the film isn't quite as cool.  This movie came in at the end of the slasher era, and along with Dr. Giggles was one of the last...ahem....stabs....at the genre before the dumb ""I know I'm in a horror movie"" slashers started by Scream.  The action takes place at a movie theater.  A high school film class decides to earn some cash by having a B horror movie marathon complete with William Castle-esque gimmicks including a giant mosquito on a wire for a film titled, ""Mosquito"", electrified theater seats for ""The Amazing Electrified Man"", and stinky gas from the theater vents for ""The Stench"".  During the films the students start getting bumped off, usually in the manner of the film gimmick they're operating.  As in most slasher flicks, the killer's motive is revenge for a past trauma.  He's able to look like the people he's killed by creating realistic skin disguises for himself a la Darkman.  His sights specifically are on ""Maggie"", our heroine, and her aunt played by scream queen Dee Wallace Stone.  What's their connection?  You'll be shocked to find out!!!!!!!!!!!  No, actually you won't really.  The backstory involving the theater and a bizarre film and it's director are actually pretty cool(the avant garde bizarro short film, ""Possessor"" is kinda neat actually), but it's rather weak as far as slasher material.  A low body count and rather skimpy on the gore.  The films that are watched in the theater are actually the best part of the film; very good reproductions of old 50s/60s monster movies.  Ray Walston shows up in a cameo, and Tony Roberts has a small role as the film class teacher(apparently Woody Allen wasn't making a movie that week).  It's more of a 3 and a half as far as the rating goes coz it's certainly not without entertainment value, and does manage to be clever now and again.  All the other reviewers are right-This dvd transfer is terrible.",1204329600,6,1998,4.744927536231884

The students begin the night by playing old 1950's horror movies for the Audience...They are all having a great time but when the movies begin strange things start to happen. Somewhere in the theater there's a masked killer who wants the students dead. This all goes on while the audience is in the theater watching the movies.

411837,3,6302025230,"My girlfriend loved it... and that sums up this horror film properly.  It's not a bad movie but it is fairly underwhelming.  With typical 80's influenced stereotypes (this was made in 1991) like the good girl, the athletetic stud, the whore, the hip black chick, etc. (although an interesting ""ode"" perhaps to Texas Chainsaw Massacre's own Franklin appears here?), but none of the typical enjoyable and exploitative 80's elements (miniscule amount of blood and guts and zero T & A).  It comes off as more of a ""made for TV"" effort that the entire family (yes, you too Grandma) can enjoy... though that's where the movie shows some of it's charm as well.  For instance there are a couple of great scenes where the darkness of the old movie theater it takes place in is utilized to great effect and makes for some genuine tension (without the need for anything graphic).  We also get a great looking villian, however; in typical fashion by the end we get too much of him and he becomes a caricature with too much dialogue and an overblown origin.  The cast is fairly enjoyable... I wouldn't go as far as to say likeable but not bad for this type of film (Dee Wallace Stone gets a bit part!).  For most diehard horror fans this will be little more than watchable... but for people who like some fun with their scares (or are under the age of 13)you could do worse than this.",1189728000,2,1371,4.526315789473684

  The fun of this one is the ""Older"" Movies that are shown. They did a great job of making these look,sound ,and feel real and they are as much fun as the main plot.

Written by the legendary Alan Ormsby (Black Christmas, Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things, Deathdream), POPCORN is as funny as it is scary and mysterious. Jill Schoelen (Stepfather, Chiller) is good as Maggie, Dee Wallace-Stone (The Hills Have Eyes, Cujo, The Howling) is her mum, and Ray Walston gets a decent little cameo!

411941,3,6302025230,"I have always had a soft spot for this movie. What I enjoyed most about ""Popcorn"", is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a fun little movie, and provides some laughs and chills. And I loved the idea of an all-night horror-fest in an old theater as the setting. I also got a good chuckle at the movie titles the students run for their midnight movies; ""Mosquito!"" and ""The Stench"". As a huge fan of 50's & 60's B-movies, I got a kick out of the filmaker's tribute to a bygone era of horror. There are some unique kills in ""Popcorn"", very little gore, no nudity and very little language.....I still am not sure why ""Popcorn"" has an ""R"" rating? The special effects are pretty good and hold up well a decade plus later. If you are hoping for another ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th""...look elsewhere. If you just want some harmless, horror movie fun along the lines of ""April Fools Day"" then give ""Popcorn"" a try.",1107129600,29,922,4.461538461538462

Nearly a cult classic, this chiller follows a group of people sitting through a horror marathon.  Unlike ""Demons,"" this is nothing more than slice and dice slasher on the loose crapola.  It does generate a few scary moments, but generates many more laughs in its lame attempt to scare us.

411943,4,6302025230,"A Jamaican college campus doubles for your usual LA setting and somehow, along with a familiar cast (Jill Schoelen, Tom Villard, Tony Roberts), gives this slasher a fresh look. Not too many scares, but definitly a passable tounge in cheek horror flick if there ever was one. The late Mr. Villard (One Crazy Summer) is surprisingly under-stated and brilliant in this, in my opinion, (& I have seen other professional critics take mention of this at the time of release, despite only luke-warm reviews in general), and I'd recommend this movie for his performance alone despite the rest of the (albeit, fun) camp.

Before horror movies became slick and stylish, staring today's ""hottest"" actors, there were terrifying movies like ""Popcorn"".  Fun, enjoyable and bloody!  ""Popcorn"" is filled with the screams and jolts that you expect from a horror movie, and the powerful storyline and acting that you don't.  The murders are creative and brutal, leaving you unsure of who you should cheer for - the killer, or his victims.

Surprise appearances by Dee Wallace-Stone (""E.T."") and Ray Walston (""My Favorite Martian""), make ""Popcorn"" the perfect movie to watch during those chilly Autumn nights.",1035504000,16,766,5.245901639344262

It was marketed as a scary movie...not a spoof...it really doesnt work on either level. Rent it, if you are very bored and feel like wasting money.

The film shows some graininess and lines at times in the DVD, they probably could have found a better master copy, but oh well it still beats VHS.

411949,5,6302025230,"In the early 1990's, before releases such as ""Darkman"", and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", when horror films were at an all-time low, and America was bombarded with cheesy made for video horror comedies, this odd, but entertaining thriller was released in theaters.
The plot was simple, an all night horror movie marathon is silently stalked by a psychopath who may or may not be a killer from the past who has come to finish what he started. It starts off as any cheesy horror film would, with a lame dream sequence, but quickly turns into much more.
The recreations of many classic 50's horror films, which is definitely the high point of the film, is worth the viewing alone.
The film is wacky, funny, and gory, very reminiscent of the opening in ""Scream 2"" which makes me wonder if Kevin Williamson ever had an original thought in that brain of his(also see ""Happy Birthday to Me"") The only weak point of the film is the ending, which was somewhat of a disappointment.
This is never meant to be taken seriously and thats the fun of it all...turn off the lights and enjoy!!",1001376000,11,1073,4.564766839378239

At the same time, her mother, Suzanne is receiving strange, borderline demonic prank-like calls that talk about hell.

Professor Davis is concerned that 3 weeks is not enough time to get all the work done, but Toby has enlisted the aid of Dr. Mnesyne, who owns a film memorabilia shop who owns the necessary gimmicks for the films chosen for the festival.

It pre-dates such movies as Matinee and Scream 2 by incorporating horror tropes while it pays homage to the gimmick flicks of William Castle.

The plot? Think of it as a macabre variation on those Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland films where they have to put on a show to make some money. In this case, the victims, er teens, are going to put on a horror-fest night to save and promote their fledgling film-making class.

Things go awry even before this in the dreams of the heroine that start off the movie. Or are then not dreams, but memories of a horror that actually happened.
