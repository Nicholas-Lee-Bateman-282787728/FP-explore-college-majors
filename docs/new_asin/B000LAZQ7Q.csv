8599997,5,B000LAZQ7Q,"This video is perfect for teaching health and wellness and for illustrating what a horrible diet with no exercise can do to a person over 30 years.  A caucasian family of 5 (mom, dad, and 3 boys) learn how to eat right and exercise.  It's not an easy road as the boys are out of control with their behavior.  The oldest son (12) is overweight, the middle son (10) has ADD, and the youngest is underweight and eats mostly sugar.  The family learns new healthy habits and the boys learn how to behave as an added bonus.",1195862400,2,517,4.298969072164948
