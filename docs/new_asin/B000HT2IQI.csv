8171679,5,B000HT2IQI,"This was a surprise to me when searching one night on Amazon for 80's metal DVD's and this was here. I was a teenager living in England when I first heard of TNT. Hailing from Norway and not well known as they were overshadowed by bigger European acts like Europe, Def Leppard, Accept, Scorpions, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, etc. during the 80's hair era. What I love about TNT is there European sound and the great voice of the American vocals of Tony Harnell. This is a great DVD/CD combo, as they perform most of my favorites here during there 2006 performance in Spain. Only in PAL format so make sure to have a multi format player, in widescreen picture and 5.1 surround sound.",1388534400,,681,4.5

8171681,4,B000HT2IQI,"just because these idiots ordered the wrong region,  does not mean it deserves 1 star.
this is great.  the lead vocals of course are great, but also the guitar playing and sound are excellent.  the back-up vocals are touched up quite a bit, otherwise i'd give this a 5 star.",1202083200,,274,4.44
8171682,3,B000HT2IQI,"This is a cool DVD/CD combo.  I had none of the difficulty with playing the dvd...i guess I have PAL or whatever??

Good song selections!  The only issue I had with this is that it is in B&W.  I guess it would be kinda cool if a few tunes were like that for  effect etc. but it got old for me.

Also, there are 3 camera angles or something???  Got really tired of seeing things from the same vantage point?  Especially  Diesel Dahl sp? Drummer).

I was really amped about this DVD seeing as that I had never seen a TNT DVD or live concert and I have been a big fan since ""Knights of the New Thunder"".  I was a little disappointed but my expectations were VERY high!

I would still recommend it. The CD alone is worth the cash.",1197072000,,726,4.070921985815603
8171683,1,B000HT2IQI,I bought this DVD expecting an NTSC format disc...I put it in my player and saw a message saying ths DVD is PAL format and cannot be played. DO NOT BUY if you cannot play PAL format discs. Rediculous waste of time as I was really looking forward to seeing this DVD.,1181347200,4,265,4.115384615384615
