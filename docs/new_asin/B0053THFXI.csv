He gives clear instruction for reading water and casting techniques  for covering potential prime steelhead holding areas.

8455657,5,B0053THFXI,"I found this series of DVDs to be one of the most useful resources for the steelheader that I have ever come across. I think that the information presented in these films is invaluable and can only improve any angler's success. The information is highly relevant despite its age and while the tackle has changed a little, the fish have not. I also highly recommend John Hazel's ""Spey Fishing Steelhead"" DVD and Dec Hogan's book ""A Passion for Steelhead"".",1309392000,,454,4.7594936708860756
