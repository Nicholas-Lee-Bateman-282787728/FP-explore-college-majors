Review:
Oh Su-Jung (Um Jung Hwa) is a very hard-working woman with an interesting past. The early years find her having many admirers, and being loved deeply, passionately, and reverently by a fellow High School student, Go Man Soo (Oh Ji Ho), who just happens to be the size of a medium-large building.

He promises her he will attend college, and become a lawyer.  He is the best prospect on the horizon, plus, she can abuse him at will. A perfect scenario for an egotistical, shallow, beautiful girl with an eye solely fixed toward financial success in life.

They become engaged, and he is more her slave than ever, adoring her beyond the limits of reality.

He is a gentle guileless soul with a great heart which beats only for her.

 On their wedding day though, Man Soo confesses to Su Jung, he's failed the bar exam.  She's flabbergasted.

As the wedding march is playing, while she is being escorted down the aisle, she makes a snap decision, runs out of the room, flees down a winding stairway in her billowing white wedding gown (a very beautifully presented shot), leaving him standing alone at the altar.

Due to life passing, and the inevitable aging process, not to mention her difficult personality, she eventually winds up a spinster fending for herself, and finds it's no bed of roses.

One day, a pro golfer arrives from America, a born and raised Korean, returning home for a competitive golf tour. He is beautiful, slender, agile, magnetic, and very popular with the ladies whom he tends to blow off abruptly with less than the cordiality they're hoping for.

Actually, he's downright rude, and very biting in his comments to them.

This man, the famous PGA Golfer Karl Go, is also Oh Su-Jung's ex. Her very bitter, wounded and still angry ex, I might add.

And that is where the story really begins.

Su Jung is in financial trouble, has no boyfriend; let alone a husband, to lean on. She is encumbered with a younger brother she wishes to put through school, a spendthrift father, and a failing business.

Karl Go, the former Man Soo, gorgeous, slimmed down and very fit indeed, not to mention, wildly successful and filthy rich, wants nothing to do with her except revenge. He finds a very clever way to get it.  After all, he's been plotting and stewing for a long time.

This story is very funny, clever, and intelligently written. It is also more profound than you'd think from the beginning chapters, and in some parts, it will start your tear ducts up.  It wouldn't be a good Korean Drama if it didn't.

It has moments of real depth and beauty, also great sadness balancing the wit.

I hate spoilers. I can't tell you more than I have already, but I will mention that this is possibly my favorite K-Drama, alongside Hotelier. It is definitely my favorite work of Oh Ji Ho's.

Uhm Jung-Hwa was a delightful surprise. I'd never seen her before.
She is wonderful in this piece. The entire cast is superb. There wasn't a moment my eyes weren't riveted to the screen as this tale unfolded.  Most K-Drama sags in the middle. This does not. It is sixteen hours of grand entertainment.",1228348800,,3688,4.697819314641745
