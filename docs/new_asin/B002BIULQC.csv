The music was outstanding, It made you either want to get up and dance or cry . It was a great movie I highly recommened it. By the way Iam 40yrs old so it's for all ages !!!!!!! :o)  WS",1247961600,,310,3.626865671641791
3894644,5,B002BIULQC,"I am a 15 year old girl, and I love miley cyrus and hannah montana.  And I'm not afraid to say it! i own ALL of miley and hannahs albums and can't wait to buy this movie!!
Miley is such a great actor and singer, and thats what made this movie so enjoyable.  She isn't just a disney star, she has got some good talent.
The movie was cute, fun, and wholesome. :)  Keep going Miley!",1247702400,,379,3.960526315789474
3894645,5,B002BIULQC,"think what u may about miley cyrus, her new movie was great! not just about a teeny-bopper popstar life, an actual moral story. i was impressed as i watched it with my daughter and her friends. keep your morals and don't go all ""brittany spears"" on us miley. you are a great role model for children....keep it up!",1247443200,3,313,4.413793103448276
3894646,5,B002BIULQC,"I'm 55 years old with a 6 year old. She was so excited to see this movie in the theater. We picked up a friend of hers to go with us and as I drove us all to the movie I was looking forward to a nice nap in a nice dark theater as the girls watched the movie. I have to say this is the kind of entertainment that should be made more often. I watched the entire movie and loved it. It was warm and the messages for kids were fabulous... especially that you can get too big for your britches. Since there is a good chance that my kid falls at least in the top 10 of spoiled kids in America... this is the kind of entertainment I want her to watch. Trust me all you Daddy's this is a good movie for you and your girls. I have a whole new respect for Miley Cyrus... She is quite a talent and her song ""The Climb"" was spectacular. A good message for all kids. See this movie... you'll be glad you did!!",1247270400,2,896,3.848648648648649
3894647,5,B002BIULQC,"My daughter (5) and I loved this movie and we're eagerly awaiting the DVD release! My expectations for the movie were rather low and I ended up wishing I could go to see it several times! There wasn't much of the typical Disney ""cheese"" for this type of movie, in my opinion. It was tastefully scripted and the acting was good too. The music was super fun and the moral of the story was a good one revolving around putting family and friends first, making difficult decisions and dealing with the consequences. It's a good ""part of the road to growing up"" movie and one I look forward to watching again with my daugther (and again after she's in bed! LOL!!).",1247011200,,658,4.446280991735537
3894648,4,B002BIULQC,"My daughters are 6 and 8. I was so pleasantly surprised by how much all 3 of us enjoyed this movie. This is classic Disney fun, corny humor, and tons of heart. The main 'moral' of the story is the importance of honoring the love of family and friends. We listen to the soundtrack together frequently, and all 3 of us are looking forward to the DVD release of the film so we can watch it togther again...and again!",1246838400,2,413,4.2405063291139244

3894651,5,B002BIULQC,"On April 25th, I treated myself to a double feature at my theater. I saw this and Crank: High Voltage. I'm really glad I saw this movie. I'm a 19 year old guy, and I enjoyed it! I love when she sings Let's Get Crazy and the Hoedown Throwdown. After upsetting Lilly at her 16th Birthday party, Robby takes Miley back to Tennessee to find her true self. She meets a childhood friend from 1st grade, Travis who still has a crush on her. After having fun in Tennessee with her friends and family, Miley thinks of letting her alter ego, Hannah Montana go for good. I loved when Miley had to be two places at once. What will she choose? I highly recommend that you get crazy, get up and dance, and see HANNAH MONTANA: THE MOVIE!!!

p.s. It's been awesome writing 600 reviews, and can't wait for 600 more!",1244505600,17,798,4.28476821192053

3894858,2,B002BIULQC,"Give HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE credit for not simply weaving three or four episodes' worth of the television program into a feature film. But if the bland Miley Stewart mid-teen crisis we get in this movie is the best they have to offer, perhaps the filmmakers should have kept it fun and light-hearted after all. Bravo for not having Ms. Cyrus say her catchphrase, ""Sweet niblets,"" for the umpteenth time. But to avoid the T.V. program format to the point where Jason Earles, Moises Arias, and Mitchel Musso have fewer lines in 90 minutes than they do in a typical half-hour episode of the HANNAH MONTANA T.V. show is like Paul McCartney refusing to sing ""Yesterday"" in concert so one can't accuse him of resting on his Beatles laurels.

HANNA MONTANA - THE MOVIE blows the adult romance story, fixing up Miley's dad with the local Tennessee woman for predictable results. A better scenario would have been having him fall in love with Hannah Montana's manager, with their opposing views on the teenager's music career.

Some of the film's songs were the best moments, namely the solo numbers by Taylor Swift and Billy Ray Cyrus, as well as the duet Mr. Cyrus sings with young Ms. Cyrus. But with Vanessa Williams in the cast, she does not get to sing?",1406851200,,1254,4.669683257918552

Odd sidenote in the Hannah Montana franchise because the final season of the show (Hannah Montana Forever) seems to ignore the events of this film, particularly the ending.

The Blu-ray transfer is top shelf material, with a surprisingly good director's commentary track.  There is also a fun featurette with Jason Earles and more music videos than you can shake a stick at.",1403913600,,553,4.680412371134021

The butterfly song touched us so much.  We watched it last year at Christmas cause my friend was over for the holidays.  Her husband always called her his beautiful butterfly.  They are raising two little ones and going through some tough times, so the songs were very inspirational.  I always get chills on It's the climb too.  That's why I order extra copies for gifts.

The songs were very well done and there are parts I really liked that resonated with the show but dug a little deeper into Hannah's thoughts and feelings. Got to say I was pleasantly surprised to hear Rascal Flatts singing on the front porch. That was nice, also the butterfly song with father and daughter was pretty moving.

3895017,1,B002BIULQC,"I'm probably unqualified to review this product.  I mean, this is like when I, on a whim, decided to watch that `Sex and the City' movie and then review it.  I mean, I don't watch `Hannah Montana', so am I really qualified to give an opinion that is so obviously in the minority (at least amongst her devoted fans).

I'll just get this over with.

I don't know why I wanted to see this.  Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment or something, but occasionally the whole teenage movie scene gives me a needed break from other cinematic ventures, and so the sing-songy pop sensation that is Hannah Montana intrigued me (slightly).  It looked like senseless fun, and if that fun is in the vein of say Raven Symone (since `That's So Raven' is actually kind of hilarious) then I'm game.  I've never seen an episode of `Hannah Montana', but my younger brother used to swear by it, like it was the greatest thing on earth (weird, I know) and so I wasn't really that apprehensive about the movie.  I figured it would be cheap fun, but fun none-the-less.

This movie is kind of terrible.

I'm taking into account that I am not a fan nor familiar with the comedic angle to the show while I write this, so I can understand if her fans think I'm harsh (and maybe I am being so) but really, how can anyone think that Miley Cyrus has talent?  First of all, I have heard her sing...and she's not very good at that.  Yes, some of her more heartfelt (if you can call them that) ballads strike a nice chord after the studio cleans them up for radiowaves, but vocally she is not strong.  Hearing her sing live (as I have suffered through on numerous television programs) is hard to stomach, and her more pop related fare is generally campy and forgettable.  Her comedic timing is absurd.  Maybe this is just what is `in' with teens (or tweens...there's a word for you Beany) but this is not comedy; this is stupid.  The opening sequence alone was just outrageously ridiculous.  Why would anyone find that funny?  It's just silly and lame.

I remember back at the Oscar ceremony back in 2008, before the film was released, and Miley was talking about it `hopefully' being an Oscar contender because it was ""so much deeper than you may think"" and I laughed because, well, she sounded delusional.  I mean, really?  This film may have a nice message about being true to yourself, but it's not `deep' by any means.

Don't be mistaken.

In the end the film is littered with overdone performances and blandly uninspired music.  It just doesn't do much of anything for me.  I know, her fans are going to crucify me (probably as much if not more so than the basement nerds did when I panned `Avatar') but I just needed to speak my mind on this one.",1280966400,7,2714,4.456389452332657
3895018,5,B002BIULQC,"This movie is for ALL ages, for the young to also the elderly. For some people, when watching this movie, it might even cause some stirred up raw emotions, breaking one into tears, because this movie can cause some painful realizations to those with some kind of painful struggles in life. This movie does come with happy endings, and Miley is fortunately given a second chance to make up for having done against others in her life. For some people, seeing this movie may have some people wishing they can go back to a certain place in their past, be it physical place or emotional place.
But I cannot highly recommend this movie enough, not only recommend, but cannot suggest enough that people pass this movie on as well. But don't just take my word for it; see for yourself!

3895019,2,B002BIULQC,"If there should ever appear a list over the most unnecessary movies ever made, ""Hannah Montana The Movie"" would definitively top that one. Believe it or not, but these words comes from a former ""Hannah Montana"" fan. From a objective standpoint, this movie makes a safe and decent family entertainment. Decent, not great. It seems as the good folks at Disney has finally realized that parents are ought to follow their kids to the theaters and has made a film that is bearable to them, too. But one thing is to make a film which appeal to all ages, another thing is make a coherent and compelling movie. With the latter, ""Hannah Montana TM"" fails completely. Sure, a coherent movie wasn't expected from such a cheesy concept as ""Hannah Montana"", but the movie also turns back to the series spirit and strips away the good components of the show; the likeable characters, the humor and the great music. Beware that there might be a slight spoilers below...

On the positive side, despite some slapstick moments, ""Hannah Montana TM"" appears as surprisingly more mature than expected, which is admirable on it's own. The dialogue is surprisingly good and the film has a few enjoyable moments, as the energetic opening, the shoe-fight with Tyra Banks, the Hoedown-throwdown and Miley's back-and-forward running between her dinner at the Tennessee major and her love interest, Travis (Lucas Till). The few scenes between Miley and her grandmother Ruby (Margo Martindale) gives the film weight and most of the acting is quite decent, too. Miley Cyrus may not be the greatest or most charismatic actress out there, but she has screen presence and pulls off the funny and emotional moments well. The most noteworthy of the rest of the cast is the likeable Lucas Till. This is a movie adaptation of a show where you don't need to have seen the series to know what the concept is about.

Unfortunately, the rest of the movie isn't much to brag about. In one of the interviews on the disc, director Peter Chelsom declares that he got this movie exactly as he wanted it be. Well, such a statement makes me doubt about Chelsom's visions as a director. After seeing the film, it seems that he haven't been sure of which movie to make. All the different components feels separate and doesn't flow well together as a whole.

Most of the humor is slapstick and is provided by the stupid and obnoxious British reporter Oswald Ranger (Peter Gunn), which feels forced and out of place. But with the exception of slapstick sequences, ""Hannah Montana TM"" is absent of any real humor. Jackson (Jason Earles), who's one of the funniest characters on the show because of his lines and charismatic personality, is only present to provide slapstick. Lilly (Emily Osment) has no a purpose on the film or has barely a funny line and Oliver (Mitchel Musso) and Rico (Moises Arias) has been reduced to cameos. Even Billy Ray Cyrus as Miley's on-screen dad, which despite the lack of acting skills provides a likeable father figure on the show, appears as generic in the movie.

The screenplay is based on a worn-out ""discover your roots and get a better person"" storyline. It would have been a nice lesson to children if the film had a final conclusion that actually made sense, but the unclear ending is one of the reasons that makes you wonder if this film even had a purpose. But there are a lot of things that doesn't make sense; one of them is the notion that no' one is able to see that Miley and Hannah are the same person. Yes, this has been pointed out by many reviewers, but at least in the show the notion makes more sense, since Miley doesn't surround herself with the same people that she does on her school. In the film, Miley surrounds herself with the same people all the time. How can they not tell them apart? Or easier said; How can nobody (even Oswald) recognize Miley's voice as Hannah during the ""Hoedown Throwdown"" sequence?

The film has several plot holes, but also with several subplots, which doesn't always flows in with the cohesiveness of the main plot (as with Jackson's subplot, which is barely present, but mostly ignored). At least Miley's secret gets discovered in this film, after the peppy running back-and-forward sequence. The mood fades and so does actually the rest of the film, which just feels wrapped up and just becomes incredibly sentimental. As Miley and her fellow casts funny attitudes fits perfectly on a frisky TV show, they just appears as extremely misplaced in a drama. Watching them on a serious concept, is just as seeing a bird without wings. And the several slow-motion shots comes off as superfluous and unnecessary.

And there's the music. One of the most enjoyable components of the ""Hannah Montana"" concept are the songs. Despite of them being mostly teen-pop, they're mostly catchy and listenable. But with the exception of ""Let's Get Crazy"", ""Hoedown Throwdown"" and Taylor Swift's ""Crazier"", the songs are disappointingly uninteresting and quite shallow. On the other hand, John Debney's score is his best work in recent years. And funny enough, Swift manages to outshine Cyrus as a performer on her brief cameo.

This movie was released in the middle of the third season of the show and could have been a practical way to end the series. But Disney has already ordered for a final, fourth season. So the question is; Was this movie really necessary? The answer is no! This movie doesn't add anything to the plot or develops it's characters! It adds absolutely nothing to the ""Hannah Montana"" conmcept and it's just a big waste time and money. And it's just a proof how far Disney is willing to market their products for cash and for what it's worth.

BONUS FEATURES
Despite of a mediocre movie, the DVD contains a quite few of entertaining bonus features. First up is a Audio Commentary by director Peter Chelsom. Most of the time, Chelsom provides an informative and listenable commentary. Although he doesn't cover up the biggest plot holes and repeats himself a few times during the track, it's still worth a listen, despite of his movie turned out to be crummy one (at least for my taste).

Next up is four deleted scenes. After a 41 second intro from Chelsom, we get ""Jackson: I 'm Pretending to be at University"" (4:31), ""How Are We Gonna Get Hannah Down to Crowley Corners?"" (1:37), ""Oswald and the Hannah wigs"" (2:25) and ""Oswald, the Ostrich and the Alligator"" (1:20). All of these clips has brief intro's by Chelsom, which tells about why they got deleted. With the exception of ""How Are We Gonna Get Hannah Down to Crowley Corners?"", which is a nice scene where Miley plays guitar in a hammock, it's easy to see why the other scenes were deleted. And if Jackson's subplot explanation was deleted, why did the parts of the subplot survived in the final movie?

Next up is ""I Should Have Gone to Film School"" (15:15). Hosted by Jason Earles (Jackson), the clip is a frisky and fast-paced ""Making off""-featurette, which contains short interviews with the cast and crew. Despite a few misplaced cartoony sound effects, the short still reveals some interesting trivia about general movie making and Earles' sympathetic personality makes the short an overall interesting watch.

""Find Your Way Back Home"" (15:00) is my favorite of the bonus features, which is basically a tour guide with Miley Cyrus and her mom Tish through their hometown Franklin in Tennessee (and a brief short with Billy Ray Cyrus bragging about Tennessee). It also follows Emily Osment (Lilly) in her hometown LA. A quite cute and energetic featurette, although is clearly that young Cyrus provides more energy and personality on-screen than Osment, which makes Cyrus' segments more enjoyable (at least for my taste)s.

The disc also includes a typical outtakes (3:48), Miley Cyrus' music video for the hit song ""The Climb"" (3:52) and ""Blu Ray is Suite"" (4:45) with Cole and Dylan Sprouse (from ""The Suite Life"" series), which is about Blu ray discs in general and seems to be an obligatory segment in every current Disney DVD/blu ray.

The ""Hoedown Throwdown Experience"" (14:39) is only available on the Blu ray Edition. The first five minutes are brief interviews with the cast and crew about the Hoedown Throwdown dance. Then we follow choreographer Jamal Sims and actors Mitchel Musso (Oliver) and Moises Arias (Rico) doing the dance step by step. A quite fun video and quite easy to follow.

In addition to ""The Climb"", the Blu-ray also includes several music videos; Billy Ray Cyrus' ""Back To Tennessee"" (4:22), Taylor Swift's ""Crazier"" (3:15), Hannah Montana's ""Let's Get Crazy"" (2:59), Rascal Flats' ""Bless this Broken Road"" (4:17), plus the movie sequences of ""The Climb"" (4:06) and ""You'll Always Find the Way Back Home"" (3:51). Why the latter numbers were included as  segments in the Video section, is a remarkable question, considering that the numbers can already be seen in the final movie. Otherwise, with the exception of the former version of ""The Climb"" and ""Back to Tennessee"", the videos are in High Definition and includes several clips from the film.

OVERALL REVIEW

The blu ray provides a nice, clear picture and a sharp sound. The Bonus features are overall mostly enjoyable, but unfortunately the same can't be said about the movie itself - at least for my taste. Perhaps Chelsom had the time of his life by making this film (as he stated in the Audio Commentary), but I didn't had the time of my life by watching this movie, which could have been better if it were in the hands of an other director. So it all depends on what you're looking for; If you're looking for a film to please the Hannah fans, this movie is a success. If you're looking for a G-rated film that the whole family can watch safely together, this movie will fit the bill. But if you're looking for a movie adaption which is equal to it's series, ""Hannah Montana TM"" may disappoint. Although most of the Hannah fans has warmly embraced this movie, my suggestion is rather to check out the show, you'll have more fun watching that.",1275436800,3,10038,4.7964141122035855

3895021,4,B002BIULQC,"I can't believe that I'm reviewing this movie!  But Disney products are hard to avoid.  Who else has seen several episodes of the series?  It may not be Shakespeare. But the show is usually fun to watch.  There should be three rules for movie adaptations of TV series.  One, don't just offer us a 90 minute episode. Two, don't contradict what we've already seen on the small screen. Three, don't make a movie that requires knowledge of the TV series.  This movie mostly follows two of these rules.  The plotline of the series is the same as this movie.  Miley Stewart is torn between being a rock star and normal teenager.  Sometimes this conflict can be overwhelming.  Yet she usually makes both worlds work.  The movie opens up with Miley and her best friend Lily frantically rushing to a Hannah Montana concert.  I found this part a little unbelievable.  By now she should know about being a professional.  Also, we've seen Lily backstage in her own disguise as Lola.  A lot of the problems with Miley/Hannah come from her new publicist.  Vanessa Williams does a great job as this character.  But I kept wondering why Robby Ray, Miley's dad/manager didn't just fire her.  A later sequence suggests that the publicist doesn't directly work for them.  Miley mentions wishing that she could be Hannah all the time.  Someone forgot about Disney's wish gone wrong bit. The theme ran through several of their series.  Miley, along with Raven, Zack, and Cody, wished on a  shooting star.  Being Hannah all the time was a nightmare.  Incidentally, where is her bodyguard Roxy?  Miley blows off the really important people in her life.  She misses seeing her brother Jackson leave for college. (The series later had him going closer to home.)  She accidentally attends Lily's birthday party as Hannah.  That was one of my biggest beefs with this movie.  Some of the series actors only get cameos. Mitchel Musso and Moses Arias are two. Note:  Arias' character doesn't know her secret.  Hannah and Tyra Banks get in a fight over shoes.  Then she wants to blow off her grandmother's birthday party for an awards show.  Robby Ray's had enough. This could be the end.  I imagine that he owns the Hannah character. The plane doesn't land in New York, but back in Tennessee. Jackson's waiting in the truck.  Miley gets two weeks to detox from Hannah.  During this time she reconnects with her family and old friends.  There's her horse BlueJeans.  It's too bad no one thought to include some flashbacks.  We could have learned more about the Hannah back story. Brooke Shields has played her mom on the series.  Her photo is shown in one scene.  I have something in common with Miley. One of my grandmothers was also named Ruby.  She was from Tennessee!  This is her maternal one.  Vicki Lawrence has played her paternal one on the series.  When Miley is starting to readjust, Hannah comes back.  Her home town of Crowley Corners is in financial trouble. A developer wants to change the place big time. Someone suggests a concert.  She gets Lily to come help.  At one point Lily even pretends to be Hannah.  Later we have Miley doing some quick change bits.  She's having dinner with the friend, and mayor.  Some parts of this movie do fall flat.  I didn't care much for the romances.  We have Miley reconnecting with an old friend.  Robby Ray also finds love.  I've often thought that Hannah's secret seemed too open.  Her father and even hometown are well known.  Various family members have mentioned it a little too openly.  One episode had a lookalike cousin, also played by Miley, threaten to expose her.  This movie has her grandmother mention it on a public street.  Thankfully no one else was close enough to hear.  The bit about the tabloid reporter seemed very silly.  His having teenage daughters should have been enough for him not to touch it.  There are three really good things about this movie.  One, we have some nice songs.  A few are done by other famous stars.  It makes you wonder.  Miley Stewart could do what Miley Cyrus has done.  Just have two separate musical identities.  She wouldn't be the first.  Ever heard of Luke the Drifter, Chris Gaines, or even Lester ""Roadhog"" Moran?  Two, there is some beautiful scenery of Tennessee.  Who else feels like paying a visit?  Three, the chemistry between real-life father and daughter Cyrus is great on the big screen too.  There will obviously be no sequel to this movie.  The series is currently in its last season.  But I hope that we haven't seen the last of Hannah Montana.  At the very least, Miley Cyrus should stay true to her youngest fans.  She can mature as a performer and still stay family friendly.",1273968000,,4669,4.697270471464019

3895047,1,B002BIULQC,"Oh my gosh this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! I feel ashamed for ridiculing Jaws II, Superman III, Batman & Robin (but that does not excuse them for being bad films). But none of them had a main character as shallow as this! Even Bella from Twilight had her parents interests in mind when she ran away with the ""vampires"" to escape the evil blood suckers (though I'm still in shock that I'm defending that film!). There aren't enough words for me to describe how bad this was. Nineteen minutes in felt like the length of the film. I can't even call this a film, it was a giant plug for Miley Cyrus and her father. Half the cast of the television series isn't even in it except for Emily Osment and I would much rather hear her sing than Cyrus. Basically all we get is an extended episode filled with more songs by this ""sensation"". I cringed as every song was played and the only other person besides Miley and the cameo people who got to sing was her father (the ONLY reason she got this role anyways) and he's a bad singer to boot. Worst of all (if its not that already), not one song is performed live. Everything is lip-synched. Not a very confident performer are you? Meryl Streep and the rest of the Mamma Mia! cast aren't professional singers (then again, neither is Cyrus or her father) and they sang most of their songs live! All the comedic moments were unfunny (even when she hurts herself), I can't remember a movie where I didn't even smile. Even the crappy movie version of Bewitched got ONE laugh out of me! The editing was sloppy and the slow motion effects made the ones used in Twilight look credible. But a few things I did learn from this picture:
1. Hannah Montana is the ONLY celebrity that anyone can like (That's what they give off in the film. There's not a single person who doesn't like her).
2. Hannah Montana can outsell the Beatles
3. If you lie to someone, you can solve everything by building a chicken coop
Seriously, everyone she hurts in this film (her best friend, her brother, her dad, her dad's love interest and her own love interest) forgives her despite the fact that she made her friend feel left out at her own birthday, didn't see her brother off to college, ruining the dinner party her dad's girlfriend set up, stands up AND lies to the guy who likes her (heck, she even manages to rip off Mrs. Doubtfire as well. But I can't understand why anybody in their right mind would like her anyway) and doesn't even remotely feel grateful for being with her family. But don't worry, build a chicken coop and all is forgiven. Then she reveals her identity, sings a song and everyone in town promises to keep her ""secret"" safe (Clark Kent had a more convincing disguise) Yeah I'd run out and sell her out for money! All in all, a badly put together film filled with bad songs, bad actors and a person whose fame I can't wait to get over! If people want family entertainment, I suggest they look elsewhere, Disney would be ashamed at what his company has become! Mediocre films, mediocre television shows and horrible actors have blackened what used to be a very good animation/film company. I mean, have you people who've given this a good review actually seen the shows on Disney Channel? None of which are half as funny as the ""live studio audience"" make it appear. The ""cleverness"" of the Hannah Montana writers (if thats what you want to call them) to take song titles from famous groups like The Beatles and ABBA to make episode titles like Promma Mia (I roll my eyes every time I see that one and makes me sick that she auditioned with that song). To think that this is the same company that gave us ACTUAL family films like the Witch Mountain films, The Parent Trap (the original of course, not that remake with the trashy Lindsay Lohan), Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Swiss Family Robinson and 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea! This should've been the actual finale but nope! We endured another season and the actual finale was just to copy the plot of the film!",1262131200,8,4015,4.463945578231293

To my surprise, it was a very nice movie.  As it turns out, Miley Cyrus is a pretty good actress.  She is much better than what you see on the television show.  The whole style of acting is much more mature but still quirky and cute.  The movie was sweet, funny, had great music, and had a very nice story line about a girl getting back in touch with her roots.  I would recommend this movie for kids and adults.",1257120000,,608,4.198275862068965

3895075,4,B002BIULQC,"I must admit that I watch Hannah Montana. I recently entered into adulthood and I still enjoy this show and others on the Disney channel. They're the perfect cure for a bad mood; where you want to escape back into adolescence and relive simpler days. Hannah Montana: The Movie (directed by Peter Chelsom) carries the same formula.

Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus) is a teenager with a big secret. She is living in two contrasting worlds. One where she is a normal high-schooler who deals with boys and catty girls. The other where she is the famous pop singer Hannah Montana. When she ruins her best friend Lily's (Emily Osment) sweet sixteen and begins to spend more time with her publicist (Vanessa Williams) than her own family, her father Robby Stewart (Billy Ray Cyrus) gives Miley a dose of reality. He whisks her back to Tennessee and presents her with an ultimatum. She must spend two weeks in her home state and decide whether or not she wants to continue to be Hannah Montana.

This movie is for children and young adults. If you're an adult you have to come in very open. These people aren't the best actors and they're not going to win an Oscar for their performances. But the movie is light-hearted and optimistic. It's a movie about growing up and deciding what's best not only for the people in your life but yourself also.

I believe that's why the younger audiences flock to this movie. Not only because it's Hannah Montana but because they don't strong opinions about what good acting or writing is.

Miley Cyrus has improved her acting skills. They're not top notch but they're better than they were when she first got started at Disney. Emily Osment is an enjoyment to watch as always. She's very real when she acts and is better than Cyrus.

The songs complement the movie and match the tone of the scene they're playing in. I must admit that Hannah/Miley's songs are addicting. Not matter how much a person might dislike her they can't deny that she has a good voice. Her `live' voice is seasoned for a young performer. She may have a career ahead of her in that area after the sensation of Hannah Montana fades away. Her recent hit ""The Climb"", featured in the movie, proves that Miley has no trouble making it onto the radio. She doesn't need Hannah to be popular.

Hannah Montana: The Movie will capture the hearts of young audiences. It may surprise an adult or two who remember that this isn't the intellectual comedy of the year. It's simply a sweet children's film.",1256256000,8,2490,4.622171945701357

3895080,3,B002BIULQC,"First let me say that the enjoyment that my 6 year old daughter got out of The Hannah Montana Movie was 5 stars. Since getting The Movie on DVD last week she's probably watched it a dozen times. It's a feel-good movie that preaches the importance of family and friends over material stuff in a material word.

If you've seen the Disney Channel series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannah-Montana/dp/B001EOQWNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannah Montana</a>, you kinda know what you're getting with this movie. Basically a lot of silliness about a pop star who no one seems to recognize if she takes off her blonde wig. Blonde she's Hannah; a little darker without the wig and she's Miley. The wig even fools people really close to her! Amazing.

While full of inconsistencies, recycled gags, clich themes and common movie morale lessons, The Hannah Montana Movie is a pleasing, warm story that young children will enjoy...especially for those already fans of the TV series. The acting is fair at best and even a little tough to watch at times, but no one involved ever really set out to make an Oscar Award winning blockbuster here, right?

It was just really nice to cuddle up with my daughter (again and again...and again), appreciate the joy the movie was bringing her and listen to her sing along to the songs. Heck, I caught myself singing along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-to-Tennesse/dp/B0022V1ZCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back to Tennesse</a>, Miley's Dad's song in the movie.

So if you have a little girl that's a fan of Miley Cyrus or the Disney series she stars in, The Hannah Montana movie will be enjoyed thoroughly. As for me, well...while not the best movie I've seen this year, I'm happy to sit through it with my little girl as many times going forward as she asks me to...and I hope it's a lot of times!",1255305600,6,1925,5.301639344262295

A lot of the movie was predictable but it didn't take the fun out of it. I loved the shoe fight scene with Trya Banks in the beginning. That was really funny.

3895111,5,B002BIULQC,"This is such an amazing movie and being a big fan of Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana it satisfied me a lot. I loved how it started out with Miley as Hannah thinking that she was going to go to New York for a performance at an awards show, but her father surprisingly flies her to where she is born Tennessee. I enjoy all the wonderful moments of father/daughter bonding between Miley and her father Billy Ray Cyrus.

  It is wonderful to see Miley finding her true self and who she is back at home. She also realizes that it is becoming harder to be Hannah and Miley at the same time, and she wants to stop being Hannah and to remain Miley only. There are a lot of high moments, bonding with family and friends at Crowley Meadows. The music by Miley/Hannah is truly magnificent and the guest appearances are really cool. I love all the songs that Miley has in here, the funny and emotional parts especially when Miley goes to get eggs from the chickens and when she sings ""Butterfly Fly Away"" with her father is such a touching moment.

  I truly enjoy when she starts ""Rock Star"" towards the end of the movie, and then realizes she can't be Hannah anymore, stops singing, tells everyone she is really Miley Stewart, and then goes into a powerful performance of her amazing-inspirational song ""The Climb."" This movie is such a wonderful mixture of self discovery, putting aside who you were, deciding what is really important, comedy, and emotional moments.

  The bonus features are truly amazing especially seeing Miley walking around the small-town where she was born Franklin, Tennessee. I also love the deleted scene where Miley is on the porch strumming the chords to ""Butterfly, fly Away"", while talking to her dad (I wish they would've kept that scene in the movie.) I give it 5 stars, because Miley is truly amazing both singing and acting wise, and all the music is truly wonderful. The movie was so amazing that it kept me so hooked on it that I couldn't stop watching it, and I have watched about six times already. I also love that they included the video for ""The Climb"" on the bonus features.

  Miley is so amazing and talented, she kept me really mesmerized with her music and acting in this movie adaptation of ""Hannah Montana"" that I will be able to watch it, many more times and never ever get tired of it. So if you're a Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana like me, then you should buy this, because it is so worth it.",1251504000,,2433,4.492063492063492
3895112,5,B002BIULQC,"Forget about all the other movies out in the theaters or the market. Hannah Montana is the best movie ever. Why? Because this movie is more reality and less glamourous hollywood. Miley Cyrus in my opinion is the best in the world at what she does, this movie proves it. The acting was real, the story was real, and it makes you wish that Hannah Montana will never, ever go away. Along with the 5 star acting you will also get to enjoy the music of Hannah Montana, and the inspirational and awesome ballad that is ""The Climb"". Everybody in the world, I don't care if you're black or white, have two or four legs, or no legs, poor or rich, young or old, human, animal, or alien, buy this movie. You won't regret it, as it is the best movie of 2009, and possibly forever. BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1251244800,,796,4.348993288590604
3895113,4,B002BIULQC,"Sweet niblets, to my grown-up shame, it turns out I fall into this movie's target demographic. Saddled with babysitting a horde of pre-teen girls (and, yes, dammit, two hyper eight-year-olds count as a horde) and dragged protesting to the living room as HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE began playing, I ended up liking the thing. So, now, I'm thinking about churning out text messages by the minute and typing out expressions like ""gr8"" and ""bff"" and ""lol,"" stuff I used to consider annoying. But, apparently, I'm right into this wheelhouse. I may even give up football.

If you're down with HANNAH MONTANA - and, by you, I of course mean all the young girls under ten and their long-suffering parents - then you already know that the premise revolves around teenager Miley Stewart whose secret alter ego is pop star Hannah Montana. The thrust of the Disney sitcom series has always been Miley's striving to live a normal teenager's life and not allowing all the glitz and glamour of being Hannah go to her head. In HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE, Miley finally gets too full of herself.

Accused of having ""gone California,"" Miley is shanghaied to her Tennessee home by her father, in hopes that Miley will reconnect with what's really important in life. And, honestly, in a one-dimensional film like this, there's only so much breaking down you can do in discussing it. I think it's a safe bet that Miley'll get back to her countrified roots. There is, naturally, a childhood sweetheart grown into a straight talking teen cowboy, and, to me, the dude's got that Josh Harnett thing going on. He initially sees Miley as shallow. You know how that goes.

The question is how do you get Cali-based Hannah Montana into rustic Tennessee. And this is where the evil land developer comes in, and, of course, he plans on constructing a mall at a woodsy habitat called Crowley Meadows. So a fundraiser event is required to save Crowley Meadows. To round off the story, a sleaze tabloid reporter is scurrying around the backwoods, trying to get dirt on Hannah Montana.

The cool thing is, something does happen later on which transcends the film's television sitcom roots. Because up until that point, the story feels sort of old and predictable and I was thinking, ""This could just as well be an extended episode of the show or maybe a television special."" But I wasn't expecting the twist, and for five seconds I had that feeling that ""Wow, they're really switching it up."" But then that little girl speaks up and plonks us straight back into self-contained television sitcom reality. But it was good while it lasted.

Fans of Oliver, Jackson, and Lilly may get a wee peeved because they're not so much in the film. Lilly gets the most screen time; Oliver is only there at the start. I thought Billy Ray Cyrus was solid, and old Achy-Breaky even gets a shot at romance. But his best moments are when he's in a scene with his daughter. Guest stars include Vanessa Williams as Hannah's publicist, Tyra Banks as disgruntled shoe shopper Tyra Banks, and Taylor Swift who sings a song.

But it's all about Miley Cyrus. And that's as it should be. She carries the film, and I think enough of her to give this sucker four stars. Miley's performance lifts the film above its trite plot and the cheesy elements. And put me down as someone who prefers it when she sings as Miley rather than as Hannah. Hannah Montana's songs are pop lite stuff and eventually all sound the same to me. But the times when Miley Stewart was singing as herself, those were the songs I relished most: the energetic and catchy ""Hoedown""; the sweet and tender duet with her dad, ""Butterfly Fly Away""; and the powerful and soulful ""The Climb,"" which I say is the best song Miley Cyrus has ever sung.

HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE offers easy laughs, some good songs, a coming-of-age story, and a girl whose superstar status was something which I, frankly, initially believed to have been founded solely on the strength of the Disney machine. But I had it wrong. Miley Cyrus has real talent. She can act. And, for sure, she can belt out a tune. HANNAH MONTANA - THE MOVIE isn't for everyone, no. But, for those who dig this wholesome kind of shenanigans, this movie knocks it out of the park.

I had to buy the movie as soon as it came out because I thought Miley did an amazing acting job compared to her TV shows. Plus after the fact I realized the was filmed near my hometown which was cool. You cant go wrong buying this movie it is great for a family time movie.",1250812800,7,364,3.8666666666666667
3895115,5,B002BIULQC,"Since 2006, ""Hannah Montana"" has not only been a popular television series for the Disney Channel but a series that has definitely made Miley Cyrus, daughter of country music star Billy Ray Cyrus, a bonafide star.

It was one thing to watch this young teenager who was 13-years old at the time, grow up and become a popular television star and music talent that would sell out many concert venues, has had her music on top of the Billboard charts and now has two Disney films under her belt.

The first film from Disney focused on a 3D version of her concert and television show personality but this time around, ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" takes to the big screen and takes a more serious look at Miley Cyrus's character as her pop star identity has now affected her family and he friendship and has come to the point that the lifestyle of a popstar has gotten to her head.

The film is directed by Peter Chelsom (""Shall We Dance"", ""Serendipity"" and ""Town & Country""), a screenplay by Daniel Berendsen (""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"", ""The Cheetah Girls: One World"") , composer John Debney (""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"", ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Sin City"") and cinematographer David Hennings (""Strange Wilderness"", ""Blue Crush"" and ""Ice Princess"").

For those not familiar with the television series, former music artist Robby Ray Stewart (Billy Ray Cyrus) has moved his family (which include Miley, played by Miley Cyrus, and her older brother Jackson, played by Jason Earles) from Tennessee to Malibu in order to manage his daughter Miley's music career.  But in order to keep sanity at their home and keep their family together, he and Miley has kept secret identities and Miley dons a blonde wig and goes by the name Hannah Montana.  Along with her best friend Lilly Truscott (Emily Osment) and friend Oliver Oken (Mitchel Musso), who also take on disguises, help protect Miley's secret.

In ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"", the film picks up with Hannah Montana's career doing quite well and is now managed by Vita (Vanessa Williams).  While Vita is successfully booking Hannah in various, major events, the fame has kept her busy to be with family (to celebrate Jackson's entrance to college) and Lilly's birthday party.  To make things worse, a member of the paparazzi is trying to figure out Hannah Montana's secret.

After Hannah ends up getting into fight with Tyra Banks over some shoes and getting plastered on the newspapers and disrupting Lilly's birthday party by coming as Hannah Montana, Robby Ray feels that his daughter Miley can't balance her time as a family member and friend and is focusing too much of her life as Hannah Montana and thus tricks her to going to Tennessee (instead of an award ceremony in New York).

Hannah is not pleased that her father has tricked her and prevented her from attending the award show and is upset that he dragged her to the farmlife in Tennessee.  But Robby Ray wants her to remember where she came from and that Tennessee was their home before California.

While in Tennessee, Miley tries to adjust to the slow-paced life and meets an old friend when she was younger named Travis Brody (Lucas Till) who she becomes closer too, while her father Robby Ray gets closer to Lorelai (Melora Hardin), but with both of them having to live secret lives, can Miley or Robby Ray ever be able to have a normal life?

""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" comes with three discs.  The first is the Blu-ray Disc, the second being the Digital Copy and the third is the DVD.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ration of 1:85:1.  For the most part, the film is absolutely vibrant.  There are many outdoor scenes that showcase the film's color.  May it be the shot at Lilly's birthday party at Santa Monica Beach to the lush area of Tennessee.  The film definitely showcases a broad spectrum of colors, all of which are sharp, clear and absolutely eye-popping.  For the most part, David Hennings did a great job with utilizing the environment with this film and overall, picture quality is magnificent.

As for audio, this is probably the first time I have seen Disney sport an English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack (the film is also presented in French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The dialogue is crystal clear and as much as this film is dialogue driven, with it also being somewhat of a musical as well, music plays a big part of this film and sounds fantastic.  Definitely good utilization of surrounds to pick up crowd ambiance or the animals at the farm but for the most part, this is a film where dialogue is king and music is also a big part of the film. Thus the soundtrack is quite crystal clear, the lossless audio definitely makes the music come alive.

As for subtitles, ""Hannah Montana: The Movie is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

A DVD is included and sports a widescreen (1:85:1) - enhanced for 169 televisions and an audio soundtrack sporting a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound soundtrack.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" features the following special features with some in 1080p High Definition or 480i Standard Definition:

  * Audio Commentary by Director Peter Chelsom - Peter Chelsom is the type of director who utilizes his commentary to thoroughly setup a scene and give credit to who came up with the ideas in pulling them off.  From utilizing scenes from Miley Cyrus's first film and inserting scenes into the film to how animals were brought in to the film and managing over a thousand extras, this is a very thorough commentary.
  * Deleted Scenes - (10:35) A total of four deleted scenes which features an introduction by director Peter Chelsom discussing why they were removed.  But for the most part, Chelsom says the film is the final cut and mostly all footage was utilized in the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"", it's almost similar to what I had to say about ""The Jonas Brothers: 3-D Concert Experience"" in that these films are created for their fans.

""Hannah Montana"" is a popular children's television show with a large following and I have watched many television shows with my son and although I'm not as familiar with her music, every decade there are shows that will appeal to their young fans and many of those who scratch their heads and just don't get why people find it so appealing.  In the 80's we had ""Kids Incorporated"", in the 90's we had ""Saved By the Bell"" and although Saturday morning teen shows and afternoon teen shows on network television are a thing of the past, these shows have continued on the Disney Channel and ""Hannah Montana"" is simply a popular series with a lot of merchandising behind the series and its star Miley Cyrus.

And those who are not fans, they are going to criticize and those who never cared for Hannah Montana or Miley Cyrus, it's a given that they are not going to give a care for this film.

But how did I feel about the film?  As a guy who tends to write a lot about teen or young entertainment worldwide, may it be their music or television careers, I enjoyed the film.  Of course, it all comes from my knowledge of the series and knowing how quarky the television series is but also knowing the difficult the character of Miley Stewart has in juggling both worlds of a normal teenager and a pop star.

But what I found more interesting is seeing Robby Ray stepping down and knocking Miley off her high horse.  He notices that the fame is getting to her head and that if he doesn't change things now, he's going to lose that daughter who was always caring for her family and her friends.

So, when it comes to the dramatic scenes, I enjoyed watching that part.  As for the music, this is more geared for her fans.  Obviously, with her single ""The Climb"" and the soundtrack of this film doing so well on the Billboard Charts, it's quite evident that she has a strong fandom of fans that are passionate for her music.  The film is not ""High School Musical"" and every scene is full of music and a little on drama, it's quite the opposite where there are more acting scenes and music plays a more important part towards the second half of the film.  Also, you get music from Taylor Swift and Rascal Flatts and both offer an incentive to check out the film as well.

There was a superhero-esque (or more like ""Spider-Man 2"") type of storyline near the end which I won't get into but overall, I suppose that those who have watched her television show will find out if Miley Stewart or Hannah Montana will be the last persona standing.

For the most part, I found the film to be enjoyable, fun and it was good to see Miley Cyrus take on an emotional scene.  I thought that the ending scene with the talent and film crew doing ""The Hoedown Throwdown Dance"" was hilarious and fun and for the most part, I'm quite confident that fans of Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana are going to have a great time with this release.

As for the Blu-ray release, you get a ton of special features and as typical of Walt Disney Studio Home Entertainment releases, its one company where you know that their releases are going to be given absolute awesome picture and audio quality.  And I can definitely tell you that this 3-Disc release will definitely be well worth it for the Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana fans.

Overall, presentation and audio wise and the content included on this release is magnificent but as for the film, it all comes down to whether or not you are a fan of Miley Cyrus or her television show.  Otherwise, if you had no care in the world for her music or the show, then you know this release is not for you.  But for those who are passionate about her music and her series, then I can tell you that this Blu-ray release is highly recommended!",1250726400,23,12033,4.697330791229742

Video
Hannah Montana: The Movie comes to Blu-ray with a 1080p AVC/MPEG-4 video presentation. I have to say I was expecting an oversaturated bubble gum pink and colorful presentation, but instead we get a more natural looking film with rich but subtle colors. The film's look varied by scene, sometimes being sharp and detailed, and other times a bit more soft and flat.

There was a thin layer of grain present throughout the majority of the film, and black levels generally held up good. The soft look of the film surprised me a bit though, sometimes making scenes look a bit more dull and flat. It wasn't too bad though, and the transfer certainly has more positives than negatives. Fans of the film should be pleased with this Blu-ray effort. 8/10.

Audio
A 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is included and I have mixed reactions. If you forget this is a 7.1 track, it's actually pretty good. the additional two speakers have minimal use throughout, they are active during any song in the film but very quiet in the mix. The audio is a bit more quiet than your average mix to begin with, so it helps to turn up the volume a bit more than usual on your receiver when viewing the film.

Dialogue was clear as can be, front and center. There are certain songs dialogue that aren't as impressive, due to the mixing of the song, and the obvious major editing of the vocals. There are also songs that sound very good and bring the oomph I was hoping for, such as 'Hoedown Throwdown', 'The Climb' and 'You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home.' 'The Climb' was one of my favorite audio moments in the film, with each instrument playing getting a bigger feel of separation and quality, the vocals also felt much more natural and really showed off the high-def audio track.

The film's effects are generally very front heavy, although they do expand more into the surround area at times. The track was far from disappointing though, and fans of the film will be very pleased with the upgrade in clarity and overall quality. 8.5/10.

Blu-news Summary
Hannah Montana: The Movie is a very average but fun family film, the more family content on Blu-ray the better and this one definitely shines when compared to many available. The film is very cheesy and bubbly, but there's nothing wrong with that, especially for younger audiences. it's a film that will have your younger kids laughing, your tweens possibly crying of joy, and you surprised it wasn't as bad as you thought it would be.

The Blu-ray release is good, not amazing, but I'm glad the Blu-ray is given the deluxe treatment when it comes to this release, also including both a DVD and Digital Copy for your kids to take on the road or watch in their bedrooms. The video presentation was pleasing, the audio was nice, and the bonus features were aimed at kids but still enjoyable overall. This disc is 'Highly Recommended' for fans, 'Recommended' for those with tweens and children, and 'A Solid Rental' for those who haven't seen it but are curious.",1250553600,3,4511,4.758974358974359
3895118,5,B002BIULQC,"I am a 31 year old full time student who loves country music.  On a hot summer day I decided to cool off by going to the movies.  There was nothing I wanted to see so I asked the ticket salesperson for a recommendation.  She asked if I ""liked Sci-Fi or country music genre's more?"" To which I replied 'country music'.  She told me, ""Go see the Hannah Montana Movie""  I thought. 'Hannah Montana' aren't I a bit old to enjoy it.  And I know she knew what I was thinking.  She said, ""I'll bet you the price of the ticket you'll LOVE it!"" meaning a free replacement movie ticket if I hated it.  I said OK.  It was 2 hours in Air Conditioning so I had nothing to lose.

This movie was entertaining, had my favorite country stars singing in it, told a heartwarming coming of age story, and had a little romance sub plot to boost!

I have now been 'Hannah Montana'-ified.  I will be buying the movie as soon as it is released and urge everyone to give it a single watch through.  You'll enjoy it, whether you admit it to yourself or not!",1250467200,3,1030,4.16751269035533
3895119,2,B002BIULQC,"As an inveterate insomniac, I'll admit to having caught all the reruns of Hannah Montana on late night Disney Channel, and I was won over not only by Miley Cyrus' perky charms but by a show that captured some of the broad but nevertheless character-driven style of classic 1960s television. So, I approached Hannah Montana: The Movie with the expectations of having a bit more fun than I did watching the Lizze Maguire movie, and that one wasn't all that bad. What a disappointment! Hannah Montana: The Movie tosses out nearly all the successful ingredients of the TV series, reducing nearly all the show's supporting characters to cameo roles. Even Jason Earles, who plays Miley's brother and frequently is responsible for generating the show's biggest laughs, seems to have been largely left on the cutting room floor. And I may have stumbled into the truth there. Hannah Montana: The Movie is so choppily-edited and so poorly structured, I think there might be an entirely better, if perhaps sillier movie on that same cutting room floor. Who knows? What we're left with is an overly serious Miley returning to her country roots, and the overlong scenes of her cornpone family strumming guitars and singing country songs are such a white-folks-got-soul cliche, they must be some kind of reverse racism. Miley remains as cute as a button, but we don't even get her usual fashion parade here. She looks distressingly like, well, just a normal girl. Surprisingly, her dad Billy Ray Cyrus comes off best, the warm charm of his TV persona translating nicely to the big screen. He's a great TV dad. But you'll have more fun watching four or five episodes of the Hannah Montana TV series than watching this movie.",1250208000,9,1709,4.876288659793815
3895120,5,B002BIULQC,"I am a grandmother of 4 children and I took them to see Hannah Montana.  I loved this movie as much as they did.  Anyone, any age, would enjoy this movie.  Family values rule in this movie.  All the actors did a great job.  I heard a lot of laughter in the theatre from folks.  Although this movie is funny, there were a couple of times I almost lost it too.  When Miley sings ""The Climb"", I wanted to cry.  Don't think you are too old to watch Hannah Montana because you are not.  You do not have to be a fan of the show to enjoy this movie.  I am not going to say any more about the plot as the other reviewers have done that.  Just go watch the movie!!!

Then when asking again all of them wanted to go. I thought it would be an OK movie, with teenage junk in it. Boy was I wrong! This movie was wonderful. It had a good story, with a great meaning behind it that EVERYONE could understand, and it was great for all ages of the kids. Music was terrific too! I'll be buying the movie so we can all enjoy what we missed on it the first time seeing it. Thanks to all that were involved in the making of this movie. It so nice to be able to take the kids to see something that is appropiate for all of them and that they truly enjoyed.",1248480000,,712,3.7533333333333334

My shock is that this movie turned out to be fun for all. DADs, DON'T LET YOUR MANLY, MACHO EGO GET THE BEST OF YOU ON THIS ONE. THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE FULL OF SOLID ENTERTAINMENT AND THE KIND OF VALUES WE CAN ONLY HOPE OUR DAUGHTERS WILL EMBRACE! There were three major values messages I was thrilled to see:
- Importance of love, honor and respect among family members.
- Value of lasting friendships.
- The need to keep one foot firmly planted on the ground no matter how high your life takes you.
