The choreography is excellent. They enter a dance competition and perform in front of real native americans. In the end, they win the competition and are awarded traditional native american garb. I'm not quite sure how the ""Ninja"" thing ties into the movie but it's great either way. I think they may have put ninja in the title to attract a bigger audience. Because young boys don't want to watch a movie about 3 kids learning how to dance. But once they see this film, they'll be saying, ""HOW....do I learn to dance like the boys in the movie?""

KNUCKLE UP

After going back and revisiting these films with my little Cuz I couldn't help but feel that kid in me from all those years ago come back. Sure I only saw the first three films growing up but honestly that is all I needed to see [I will eventually get to the fourth film]. This film was the third film in the series but actually the second one shot. That makes sense since the original three ninjas are back in the roles after the second [only Colt was portrayed by the same actor in the second film]. This one wasn't as fun and carefree as the second but it was a little more serious. Also the ninja action is in full swing once again.

This time Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum are helping out a girl at a Native American village who has lost her father. By lost I mean that he went missing and she suspects foul play from a company that is dumping waste on their land. So after running into a few of them giving the girl a hard time at a pizza place they agree to help find her father and expose the company for what they are doing.

Once again nostalgia set in for me while we were watching this and I will be the first to admit that. I have to say that the action in this flick seemed like it was at a higher level than previous installments. Now that may be because this one was a little more serious was also the only one to get a PG-13 rating if I am not mistaken. So the action here is great especially for kids from the martial arts action to the car chase that happens. The car chase is cool and there is one moment that actually looks like someone really got hurt.

The fight scenes are great here like the pizza place event in which our heroes still hold onto their pizza trays while fighting. Then there is the Native village brawl that is great and the empty town beat down the boys deliver. Still the most fun one may be the plant where they find the girls' father; I just love the maze like look of the place at night.

Also it was good to see the original three back together although I did like the two new ones from the second film who played Rocky and Tum Tum. Like I said about the second one it would have been cool to get a commentary with the three ninjas even now as adults talking about the films. Just like the last film previous to this one it may not be the classic the first film is but it is still a good kid flick.",1410825600,,2360,4.044967880085653

Out of all three of the ""originals"", not including High Noon at Mega Mountain, this is my favorite. As I've gotten older, it is funny to see and analyze where they had to cut filming in '92 when Michael Treanor and Chad Powers decided they didn't want to act anymore (1/2 way through filming) and '95 when they came back to finish the film! If you watch closely, you can tell the differences in mainly Max Elliott Slade (Colt) and Michael Treanor (Rocky) who, being the eldest, was pubescent going through voice change and had gotten braces in the 3 year idle period.

They don't cuss, or make a grand show that kicking someone's butt is their main objective. Even at 30 or 60 its funny. I wouldn't say corny, its more smileably sweet. And a good price, I'm actually really glad to see that they're all on DVD now.

I should also mention I've shared it with my little sister and she adored them so much she asked to watch it six times and I've watched it with her, and didn't wanna scream! Ahaha.

686047,3,6303499171,"The late Sang-Ok Shin was one of South Korea's most acclaimed directors during the country's golden age of cinema, creating drama and war pictures mostly during the 1960s that received awards and recognition from as far as Europe. In 1978, his life took a turn for the astonishing when he was reportedly kidnapped by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il for the purpose of directing nationalist pictures, including the socio-political kaiju flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulgasari/dp/B000055XTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulgasari</a>. Eventually, he escaped oppression and received asylum in America. Because he was Asian and because Asian directors were starting to hit it big in the States, it's only predictable that his eventual American film (also his last one, ever) was a martial arts outing aimed at family audiences. Whoof.

The story: when the returning ninja kids Rocky (Michael Treanor), Colt (Max Slade), and Tum-Tum (Chad Power) begin what they expect to be a boring summer with their Grandpa (Victor Wong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Emperor/dp/6305261032/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Emperor</a>), they inexplicably find excitement in a local Native American community oppressed by a greedy tycoon (Charles Napier,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Blood-2/dp/B0004Z33EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Blood 2</a>) using their land as a chemical dumping ground. Determined to help, the boys use their training to thwart the man's plot to stop a costly court case from securing the Indians' rights.

No, I'm not actually bitter at the film, but I still can't help but think that Shin (working under a pseudonym) was pigeonholed by American producers who didn't know what to do with him other than stick him with something stereotypically Asian like a martial arts flick. You could almost understand it if it were, say, a historical drama like Japan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Belt/dp/B001F0TT2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Belt</a>, but while the plot of ""3 Ninjas"" concerns itself with an issue as relevant as Native American plight, its delivery is intentionally childish and full of slapstick. Native Americans have played a small but definite role throughout western martial arts features - from cult films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Jack/dp/0790740729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Jack</a>&nbsp;to mainstream flops like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Deadly-Ground/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Deadly Ground</a>&nbsp;and current DTV fare like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Missionary-Man/dp/B000YPUFB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Missionary Man</a>&nbsp;- but this isn't their proudest hour. Their portrayal as a whole isn't awful, but because most of them are adults, they are shown as almost completely incompetent as the villains in comparison to our three Caucasian heroes.

Of course, these heroes aren't totally without merit. I can do without Tum-Tum entirely, both the character and the actor, but Michael Treanor and Max Slade come across as respectable action heroes in-training. I have to point out, these boys can really kick butt. Their smooth forms display a familiarity with martial arts that's nothing short of impressive for their age. Additionally, these guys have serious endurance: the least I can say about the movie is that it's a veritable opus of martial arts action, with approximately six fights of which almost all reach five minutes or more in length. Of course, a lot of the action is extremely implausible and not very convincing, but it's hardly uncreative and at times the kids' moves remind you of something Jackie Chan might do - hardly coincidental, since action coordinator Wan-Chang Lin has previously worked on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prisoner/dp/B00000F2MG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prisoner</a>. There's a definite Hong Kong flair to portions of the brawls, including a few cool (but obviously doubled) moves like a rebounding corkscrew kick and a backflipping dropkick.

The movie isn't made with any kind of special flair beyond looking competent, suggesting that director Shin's talents were wasted on a project of which kind he had no experience with. There's an overload of poorly-done voiceovers early on in the film and the acting is almost universally bad, but because I've seen none of the series' previous movies, I don't know whether to blame this on the director or an existing standard. In addition, I don't know how this second-to-last installment ranks against its fellows - all I know is that it has way more action than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles/dp/6304698739/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>&nbsp;but still isn't as fun.",1319587200,,5155,6.7357357357357355

No...and I'll tell you why.

You don't get this movie and think to yourself ""I'm about to be fully engaged with deep dialog and engaging plot.""

To enjoy this movie, you ask yourself one simple question: ""Do I have a son who is over five and under 10?"" If the answer is yes, then I say give this movie a shot.

In the mind of a young boy, this movie has action, romance and clearly defined good guys and bad guys. The fight scenes are safely violent (if that makes any sense) and there is plenty of slapstick to keep your kid laughing.",1318464000,2,566,4.212962962962963

now the first one is my favorite but I was glad to see the original 3 back. All the girls either had a crush on Michael Treanor as Rocky or Max Elliot Slade as Colt who was in all 3 Michael was not in all three. I do wish the dvd had some interviews it is still worth adding to my collection. The dance the brothers do in this one is fun also. I do think when this movie came out
which was delayed it should have been second that the critics were too hard on this granted as I stated it's not better than the first but it's still has laughs and fun the kids are adorable,grandpa is loveable, so why pick it apart just sit back and enjoy with your kids or grandchildren. Fun fact all 3 actually are trained in Martial Arts Michael Treanor ( Rocky ) became a black belt at the age of 12.

My favorite is the first one; however, all of them make my son belly laught.  All three ninja movies are without rude or vulgar humor and there isn't any bad language.

686127,4,6303499171,"Well if you ever had any thought that Sid wasn't a well rounded movie watcher this should set the record straight. You may wonder why would you ever want to watch a 90's kid's movie like this? Well at the time of this release we were kids and remember seeing the original back in 1992. Even at the age of 11 in 92 the first film titled 3 Ninjas was viewed in hysterical laughter from the concept of these young kids doing any damage. So if there were laughs to be had then, imagine 17 years later with a third installment to the series. Naturally we didn't seek this one out as it was on t.v with a bored Sid looking for something to watch. Once we saw the first few minutes where these 5th graders take out a gang at a pizza place we knew it was worth the watch.

In 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up you have the three original characters Rocky, Colt, and Tum Tum (yeah even their names are intimidating) take on a wealthy yet dangerous businessman whose dumping toxic waste in the community. Being that the mayor and cops are juiced in there is no other option then sending the elementary school ninjas to shake things up. This one has more ""what the F"" moments then anything we've watched since Ninja Vengeance. It's filled with so many laughs from the thought of how dangerous these kids are. Not to mention all the 90's phrases like ""Psyche,"" ""Not, and ""Radical"" thrown around in hopes of gaining kids respect at the time. The best/most bizarre scene would be after a big fight, that included Ninja grandpa would looks like an overweight Mr. Miyagi, where the grandpa is getting message by all three kids while they all sit in the hot tub. We were waiting for Chris Hansen to come around the corner saying ""How you doing tonight?""

So despite all the jokes that can be made about 3 Ninjas Knuckle up it was actually supremely entertaining. Not by conventional means, but by the way Sid always loves it in the category of ""so bad it's good."" For this one to be enjoyed you probably had to grow up around the time that it came out or else it will just be terrible. See for Sid this brings back great memories of being a young kid with no responsibilities outside of doing Mrs. Anderson's (old people) homework. Even if you aren't in the same age range you may still get some great laughs just from the movie's unreal b premise and action. It's just hilariously bad in every sense. The fight scenes will leave you speechless in the best way you could ever imagine.",1257552000,,2453,4.389010989010989

686130,3,6303499171,"Before I start reviewing the movie itself, I feel it is important to note that the first 3 Ninja movies were released out of order. 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up was in fact shot back to back with the original which also had the original three actors from the first movie. Both 3 Ninjas and Knuckle Up came out in 1992 but for some reason Knuckle Up did not get released to the public until a year after 3 Ninjas Kick Back(1994-1995). So what I'm saying is that 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up is in fact the second of the original 3 Ninjas trilogy. Moving on to the movie itself, Knuckle Up takes place the next summer after the first movie. Rocky, Colt, and Tum-Tum help defend the land of Native Americans from a greedy land lord and his goons. This movie while good did not make it to the theaters even though it has the three kid actors and the same grandfather actor from the first 3 Ninjas. I'll admit that it was a bit weak with over-the-top humor from time to time but the large amount of action/fight scenes make up for it. Still, if you are a fan of the original 3 Ninjas trilogy like myself then you will pretty much find Knuckle Up to be worthwhile.

686133,2,6303499171,"I only gave it two stars because I understand this was a kid's movie, but I frankly thought it sucked. As I stated, I know it's a movie for kids but do they really have to say ""I-ya!"" during every attack? And, as in most kid's movies, the goons are either mentally retarded or they were on sale at the Henchmart. They rush in groups of two and are easily defeated by our ""Ninja"" heros and soon get up to repeat the cycle. The main badguy is, as usual a businessman who wants to either opress something or someone or rule the wolrd, and in this case he wants to opress the Indians. I found the acting overall to be terrible and that of an elementary school play. The humor was the same as the acting offering this as the funniest joke, (according to the people in the movie).

Fat Boy: I thought ninjas were bad guys.

Rocky(?): No. There are good ninjas and bad ninjas. Just like dentists!

Crowd: Hah ha ha ha ha!

But although this sort of movie shouldn't be reviewed by the likes of me, I would recommend this movie for children because it sports the classic ingredients for a good kid's movie. To anyone else who doesn't like kid's humor or cute movies, just stay away.",1119052800,9,1173,4.294117647058823

686196,5,6303499171,"The original brothers return in this, the third installment in the 3 Ninjas Trilogy.  Like a lot of fans of the series, I really enjoyed the first film a lot.  It just had the perfect blend of humor, action and drama to make for a great adventure.  Michael Treanor as Rocky, Max Elliot Slade as Colt, & Chad Power as Tum Tum really had some great chemistry together.  Rocky was more of the sensitive thinker, while Colt was more of the aggressive type.  And Tum Tum?  Well, he was more a combination of comic relief as well as a way of letting smaller kids feel like they could be a ninja too.  But like many fans, I was very disappointed with the 2nd installment, 3 Ninjas Kick Back, because Michael Treanor & Chad Power were replaced by two other actors.  This was the biggest mistake in the world and it crippled the franchise as a result.  Kids aren't stupid.  They will notice when you change actors on them in a movie.  Thankfully, Treanor & Power returned for the third installment, 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up.
Directed by Simon S. Sheen, ""Knuckle Up"" is a story about an indian community being mistreated by a cruel and sadistic landowner (played nicely by Charles Napier) and it's up to the 3 Ninjas to take him down, with the help of a pretty indian girl named Jo (played by Crystle Lightning).  The Kevin Costner movie, Dances With Wolves, brought about a huge interest in Indian culture, and ""Knuckle Up"" is one of the many films about Indians that was made as a result.  There is a true mysticism about their ways that the brothers discover and make their own.  But then you gotta love the 3 Ninjas Dance!!
This film may not be as clever or humorous as the original, but it still is great fun.  Colt fighting a bunch of guys while holding a pizza in one hand is just an example of the cool choreography.  And those who scoff at the cuts of Victor Wong (Grandpa) with his stunt double, which were handled more effectively in the first film, should know that this film was made on a very low budget, much lower than the first two films, and they just didn't have the money to make it more realistic.  But what's really great about the film is its heart.  There's a great moment where Rocky (the thinker) understands the meaning of the flowers and why he and his brothers need to be more like them.  Great scene!
The DVD doesn't have much as far as special features.  You get both the Widescreen & Full Screen Presentations (I recommend the Widescreen version) as well as some bonus trailers of other films like: Roughnecks, Buddy, Beverly Hills Ninja, The Karate Kid & Jumanji.  The front cover of the case is odd because the 3 Ninjas are all dressed up in white karate outfits, which they never wore in the film at all.
This film has a good message and plenty of fun humor, action and heart to entertain just about anyone.  I recommend it and the first film highly.  It's too bad these guys didn't do the fourth installment (perhaps they were just too old by then?).  This would've also made a great TV show for kids too.

The thing about this movie is even things that aren't supposed to funny are. For instance the stunt doubles, it is so obvious when the grandpa fights that it is someone else, but i still think it is funny.",1051056000,,346,4.257575757575758

This movie is so much fun!  remember the part where Colt says,  ""hi-yaa!"" and then the juke box played the song, and then the  part where they drive the car through the field, and then Rocky says,  ""who taught you how to walk?"" (that's my favorite line) and then  they rescue the Indian dude and the dog chases them into the sewers and  they meet Rambo and steal Wonka Bars from the peddler and then they build  their own sling shots and the dudes run away from the wooden snake trick  digital unicorn?  wasn't that part just the best?
