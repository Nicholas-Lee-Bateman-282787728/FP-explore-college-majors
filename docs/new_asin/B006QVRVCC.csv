8503386,5,B006QVRVCC,"This is a series of 30-minute quasi-documentary animations depicting the exploration of the solar system in the 21st century.

There is a similar series that airs on PBS called Zula Patrol aimed at kindergarteners. Destination Space treats similar subject matter (space science and exploration) with a great deal more sophistication for what I estimate to be the high-school or junior h.s. audience.

Examining the DVD slipcase, I see the date of publication to be 1999 and the artwork is copyrighted 2011 by Timeless Media. So I suspect that this was originally a series that aired on cable TV in 1999 and was subsequently repackaged for distribution on DVD by Timeless in 2011. Therefore, the CGI imagery was generated some 14 years ago, in 1999.

The quality of the animation seems to be just a notch lower than the most recent offerings by Pixar. Given the technology available back in 1999, I have to rate this as somewhat impressive. The colors seem just a bit less bright, and the motion just a bit less fluid than current CGI technology.

The animation closely resembles those released by NASA documenting for publicity purposes the various unmanned missions sent into the solar system, as the Mars rovers and the Cassini mission to Saturn. In fact, many NASA organizations appear in the credits as having participated in the creation of the series, such as the Johnson Spaceflight Center, Goddard, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I don't dowbt that much of the animation in this series is due to their efforts.

Now for the series content. Like Zula Patrol, each episode features a small cast of characters that fly off into the Solar System to perform some mission. Unlike Zula Patrol, there are no antagonists (villainous space aliens) or other kinds of space creatures (like talking planets). The story emphasis is on the dangers and difficulties of venturing forth into dangerous space environments.

The cast consists of five ""characters"", the Super Intelligent Machines, or SIMs (pronounced S-I-Ms, three syllables). Since one of the story emphases is on the dangers of space travel/exploration, the narrator explains in the first episode that the SIMs were created to explore the solar system and allow the vulnerable, fragile humans to remain safely on Earth. (later in the series it is explained that humans never venture farther than Mars, and even in that same episode the SIMs must come to their aid due to a spacecraft failure caused by ""human error"". In the episode in which the SIM's destination is Mars itself, the humans return the favor when they experience a malfunction. A balanced presentation typical of the show's writing.)

SIM-1 is the long range spacecraft named Earthlink. She vaguely resembles the Shuttle Orbiter, but takes off from a runway on Earth and launches to an orbital rendezvous with the Space Station. There the SIMs are outfitted with what special equipment they need to accomplish their mission, and then Earthlink takes off for their destination. Each nission begins and ends on Earth.

SIM-2 is named Lander. He is an elongated spacecraft that resembles a bus. His main job is to transport the last three SIMs to the surface of the destination body. In missions involving exploration of low gravity destinations, he functions as a standalone spacecraft.

The last three SIMs are basically saucer-shaped vehicles with various appendages. SIM-3 is called Legs because he walks over rough terrain on a pair of mechanical legs. SIM-4 is named Wheels and can scoot more efficiently over flat terrain. SIM-5 is named Hover since he has jet propulsion that permits him to fly over any terrain, or to undertake independent missions at a remove.

Each mission is to a specific destination. Episode 1, for instance, is titled Mission to an Earth Threatening Asteroid. The five SIMs set off after outfitting at the Earth Space Station, and deploy a mass driver to divert a half mile wide asteroid on a collision course. Along the way, the narrative flow is interrupted at intervals to supply the viewer with factual information pertaining to the mission and its particular destination. The basic science facts about the object in the solar system are presented, often using genuine NASA video footage. Also, past actual space missions flown by NASA to the destination are described and shown to the viewer. This is why I describe this series as a ""quasi-documentary"". Overall I'd say the mix of fact and fiction is about half and half.

Noteworthy is the emphasis given to the dangers and difficulties of space exploration. For instance, in the first episode I named above, it develops that the mission planning for the asteroid encounter was faulty; the mass driver produces insufficient thrust to avoid the collision. This is blamed on a military-supplied computer named Archie that is entrusted with mission direction. SIM-3 Legs improvises an alternative solution (solar heating of underground ice, producing an exhaust jet), and SIM-1 Earthlink uses her overall authority to overrule Archie. The mission is saved and Archie never appears again in the series.

In most every episode, some hazard arises that the SIMs must overcome to accomplish their mission. Some involve mechanical or electronic faults, and others involved unexpected natural hazards such as meteroids, radiation, extreme hot/cold, solar flares, and once a gamma ray burst from a lightyears-distant hypernova. Some of the difficulties are caused by the SIMs themselves, by accident. It seems even superintelligent computers are not infallible. Sometimes Hover causes mischief, as he seems to be portrayed as the most junior, immature crew member. For instance, in the episode Mission to Titan he brings along an oxygen cylinder as a prank. Predictably, it explodes when he drops it in Titan's methane-laden atmosphere.

The missions are written with some sophistication, making for a more interesting viewing experience than might otherwise have been presented by a less diligent writing staff. For instance, in the episode Mission to Europa, the team is dispatched in a hasty manner after an asteroid is observed to impact its surface, leaving a hole in its ice crust. They hurry to Europa to sample the global seawater ocean before the hole can ice over. As it happens, when they arrive the hole has again frozen over, but a deep fissure in it permits Hover to fly several miles down and thrust his plutonium-clad poker into the thin ice to retrieve a sample. A lazy writer could simply have the team land and drill a hole through the surface, and be done with it. It seems to me the writers took every opportunity to liven up the plot of each episode with all sorts of imaginative asides.

Since the program is somewhat dated, there are a very few minor technical inaccuracies. Pluto is described as the ninth planet, but in 2006 was officially demoted to ""dwarf planet"" status by the IAU. (however, the narrator does state that Pluto is not really planetlike and more closely resembles a Kuiper Belt Object) The more recent space missions are not mentioned since they launched after the show's production in 1999. These include the MESSENGER probe sent to Mercury, the Mars rovers after the Pathfinder mission, and the various asteroid and comet probes. On the plus side, however, some really interesting things are presented, like the lava caves on the Moon (suggested by many as likely shelters for the first Moon explores to return there), and amazingly, the fact that Mercury has frozen water ice in the permanently frozen craters at its poles. I knew from my reading on the subject that radio astronomers have known this for the past 30-some years, but when they actually showed the radiofrequency photos of the Mercury polar ice I nearly fell out of my chair! I'd never seen that photo in any of my Mercury books.

So I give the show five stars for being well-written and enjoyable. You won't get any advanced knowledge like what tidal locking is, or what a Hill sphere is, or that orbits are often inclined to the ecliptic. But the purpose of the show seems to be to get school kids interested in space and Wikipedia can then satisfy any curiosities aroused. I think it's good for kids to see spacecraft flying backwards through space, and when the plan view of the solar system is shown, to see how the relationships and the distances between the planets are constantly changing with time. And considering the modest purchase price, it seems a good deal to boot.",1378684800,2,8492,5.004249291784703
