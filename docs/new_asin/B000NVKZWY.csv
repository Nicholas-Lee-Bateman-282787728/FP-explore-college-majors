2784659,5,B000NVKZWY,I love this DVD - finally an exercise program for pregnant women that yields results and makes you sweat!  Highly recommended!,1191110400,7,126,5.0
2784660,5,B000NVKZWY,"I highly recommend this video.  I have been doing it off and on throughout my second and third trimesters and have not gotten bored with it at all (as compared with the FitMama video by Leisa Hart, which I find to be more suited for the extremely out of shape individual who likes lots of repetition and no variety).  I think Erin's personality and energy make the video a pleasure, and you will get a great lower body workout (with some upper body stuff thrown in there).  I've never actually tried the partner workout, but from watching it, I think it looks great also.  This video is definitely worth buying, or at least checking out from your library to see if it's a good fit for you.",1185408000,24,689,4.4015748031496065
2784661,5,B000NVKZWY,"I could not believe that with no weight all, I could feel the burn.  I also had my heart rate moniter on, and my hear rate was up there eventhough this is not a aerobic-type workout.  It was great for the lower body, but did not have much for the upper body.  But, the production is odd.  I did not care for it.",1181260800,3,311,3.888888888888889
2784662,5,B000NVKZWY,I love this video as she challenges me.  Most prenatal videos bore me and I endure them simply because I know I should do SOMETHING and cannot work out like I used to.,1178928000,14,167,4.0606060606060606
2784664,3,B000NVKZWY,The workout itself is good but it looks like a home video. The production quality is poor and there is horrible lullaby music in the background.,1435881600,,144,4.576923076923077
2784665,5,B000NVKZWY,A workout that is neither too hard nor too easy. I've done it in all three trimesters. Erin is interesting and not annoying like so many fitness video teachers are! The background music is annoying and repetitive but not too hard to tune out most of the time.,1429747200,,259,4.416666666666667
2784666,5,B000NVKZWY,"Okay, so the actual prenatal workout threw me for a loop.  I was really in shape before my pregnancy, running every day, and it was still really challenging and fast-paced for me.  I put it back in the case and put it on the shelf.  I didn't reach for the postnatal rescue until after my son was already walking, which I think could have been a huge mistake.  I love the postnatal workout, and Erin's understanding and not overly demanding exercises post birth are just what a new mom needs!  Broken up into short 15 minute segments that any mom can do, no matter where you are or what shape birth left you in, it is just the right video to ""tone and rehabilitate muscles.""  She is reassuring and calming, and she's a fantastic class leader.  I would recommend this video to everyone, and you can be sure that in my next pregnancy, I'll be taking another look at that prenatal DVD!",1429401600,,881,4.401234567901234
2784667,4,B000NVKZWY,"I couldn't use the prenatal portion as I was put on rest shortly after purchasing it but the postnatal video is great. 3 stages to progress through. Took off one star because it isn't very professionally filmed, but it does the job safely for postpartum so I can live with that.",1427932800,,278,4.470588235294118
2784668,5,B000NVKZWY,"I love this video!  It gives me a good workout without being over challenged.  The other 2 DVD's I bought, I didn't feel like I worked out afterwards.  However, with this one I had a slight sweat and felt great.  I wouldn't recommend it for people that haven't worked out recently.  I don't mind the in-home cinematography.  I think she has a great matter of fact but encouraging tone that isn't too superficial and cheesy like some workout DVDs.",1426636800,,446,4.582278481012659
2784669,5,B000NVKZWY,"great, and funny!",1423094400,,17,5.0
2784670,3,B000NVKZWY,"This was hard for me to do pregnant, and I was exercising pretty regularly beforehand. I really like Erin's other dvds, but was kind of disappointed in this one (probably just because I had such problems completing it).",1413244800,,219,4.7894736842105265
2784671,4,B000NVKZWY,"My fitness level: At about 9 weeks pregnant, I completed a triathlon and was doing the 30 day shred dvds. Took a break for 8 weeks due to pregnancy sickness. Tried doing the 30 day shred DVDs and was much too out of breath. Found this.

I like this DVD. I tried really hard to find something challenging, as I've done prenatal dvds in the past that were too easy. I wouldn't say this DVD is challenging in the physical sense. I find it boring, because its 40 minutes long and I'm used to 20-25 minute fast paced workouts. But you aren't stuck doing the same exercise for 2 minutes, and that's nice. Also, shes not annoying like a lot of these fitness personalities are. I found my heart rate going up (but not out of control), and I was sweating so I consider it a good workout.

Again, I wish it was more like 20-25 minutes, but I think it's more of a pregnancy thing to do a lower impact workout for longer.  Overall, a good purchase and I'm glad I bought it.",1412035200,2,961,4.211956521739131
2784672,5,B000NVKZWY,It's a little cheesy but it's actually a very good workout.,1410739200,,59,4.454545454545454
2784673,5,B000NVKZWY,Love this fitness dvd!!! It was easy to do in my own home since it doesn't require anything special. She uses her body and sometimes your furniture to help keep you heathly and active. I will recommend to all my pregnant friends.,1410480000,,229,4.476190476190476
2784684,2,B000NVKZWY,This video was not good and there was improper form of some exercises used. Not worth your time. I tried the video twice when I was pregnant but this video was not one I enjoyed. I was very active during all three trimesters and this video truly felt like a real waste of time.,1406851200,,277,4.148148148148148
2784685,4,B000NVKZWY,I found Erin to be uplifting and the videos to be exciting and challenging.  She was really working it well into her pregnancy which I appreciate while working out and feeling sorry for myself because I cant make it through with the extra pregnancy weight!  The postpartum videos are good too.,1401321600,,293,4.7254901960784315
2784686,5,B000NVKZWY,Its a good combination of cardio and toning exercises that allows you break a sweat without hurting yourself (especially if you were active before). Highly recommended.,1397174400,,168,5.5
2784687,4,B000NVKZWY,"I have only done the prenatal workout so far, and I am glad there is a post delivery DVD to do later. I really like the workout and don't get too bored doing it a few times a week. Erin is a good instructor and keeps you motivated. I always feel like I got a good workout, but don't feel overly exerted. The problems I have with this DVD are the weird music and the filming. The music is remixed lullabies. I don't want to listen to lullabies while I'm working out, just because I'm incubating a baby doesn't mean I suddenly have terrible taste in music. The cinematography is pretty rough. It bothers me every time I turn it on, but after getting into the workout I'm able to mostly ignore it.",1396828800,,694,4.225563909774436
2784688,4,B000NVKZWY,A good all-around work out. I was 7 months along when I ordered and got started and it challenged me. Will definitely use it more in future pregnancies.,1396483200,,152,4.464285714285714
2784689,5,B000NVKZWY,I wish I could give this more stars.  The prenatal work out was thorough but not overly strenuous.  The postnatal workout was relaxing and still effective.  Erin somehow manages to motivate while also making you feel like if you need to take it easy it's ok.  I only gained 19 pounds during my pregnancy and I attribute this partially to my morning workouts.  If you want a noisy fast paced work out this isn't it but I absolutely loved it.,1396137600,,440,4.45
2784690,4,B000NVKZWY,I found the workout to get my heart rate going but not too strenuous for me.  I really enjoy it.,1395619200,,96,3.8
2784691,1,B000NVKZWY,"I have been using the Summer Sanders workout since I got pregnant.  I love that workout, just wanted something different.  I got this workout because of the reviews.  It is horrible.  The quality is horrible, the sound is horrible, and she acts like an idiot.  I work out 3-4 times per week and have for sometime now. I do not claim to be a hugh health buff, but I try to stay fit. In my opinion, I think this workout is a bit much for pregnancy. I am sure its not for someone who is exteme in working out. I just thought all around it was horrible.  I will just be using my Summer Sanders one.",1394496000,,594,4.077586206896552
2784692,5,B000NVKZWY,"Don't know about you, but I am too uncoordinated to follow aerobics! This is perfect for me since Erin herself is pregnant, doing typical exercises (tweaked for pregos) solo in her living room. I've yet to do the postnatal workout but I'm sure it will be just as great.",1392681600,,269,4.510204081632653
2784693,5,B000NVKZWY,"This is probably my favorite of my prenatal workouts, because I actually feel like I burned some calories and got a total full-body workout, and it was never boring.  I like Erin's personality.  I got my husband to try the couples workout with me one time, and we did have fun and laughed throughout.  We were both sore the next day.",1392595200,,333,4.426229508196721
2784704,4,B000NVKZWY,"I'm very active, but the first trimester really took it out of me, this is a great 40 minute weekday workout, and I still have energy for my longer weekend workouts (now that I'm in my second trimester).  Plus - it will make your legs sore in great trouble spots!",1391990400,,263,4.26
2784705,3,B000NVKZWY,"At first I really disliked the filming and the bad sound system.  After I got through feeling like I got ripped off by the quality of the production, I like that this workout got my heart rate up so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars.  Also, the price is great for what is included.  What I don't like is the amount of stress placed on my hips to do the squats and lunges.  I could tell they were strained by these moves and I lost my balance multiple times.  I'm only 21 weeks pregnant and I doubt my balance is going to be good enough to do this video at 7 months.  I much prefer the Slim and Toned Barre video which has a lot more muscle endurance to it and less range of motion and balance requirements.",1389052800,,705,4.0359712230215825
2784706,5,B000NVKZWY,"I am so pleased with this DVD! I am 17 weeks pregnant and this has been great. The moves are basic enough but I actually feel sore then next day and sweat a little too. Erin O'Brien is great! She is not flashy, not overly excited or annoying. She leads you thought at a fast pace, so you do have to be ready for the next thing. Now that I've done it a few times, I know whats coming and I'm prepared. I feel like this is something I will be able to continue with my entire pregnancy. I also like that there is a post-pregnancy work out! I highly recommend this DVD!",1387238400,,565,4.008849557522124
2784707,4,B000NVKZWY,"The best thing about this workout is that you do not need any extra things like weights, a yoga mat, pillows, etc.-just a couch and chair. It is a challenging enough workout for pregnancy but I never felt like I was overdoing it. I can't comment on the partner workout segment since I didn't do that part. It seemed a bit cheesy, and I doubt my husband could be convinced to do it with me! : ) I can't comment on the post-natal DVD that comes with this as I haven't opened it yet. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that out of the 3 prenatal workout videos that I purchased, this came in as my 3rd favorite. It doesn't offer as many options as some of the other videos. All around a good choice, though!",1385078400,,719,4.070422535211268
2784708,4,B000NVKZWY,It was a really good dvd however I didn't get to watch it more than a couple of times due to pregnancy complications.,1383782400,,117,4.130434782608695
2784709,4,B000NVKZWY,"I bought two DVDs to start exercising during my 1st trimester. I purchased this one and 10 minutes Pilates. I tried the 10-minute Pilates 1st and it was a good starter DVD because I normally do not exercise much. The next day I did O'Brien's DVD. It was more upbeat and at a faster pace. She does however have you going all over the living room, but it's not so bad.  I was able to follow through even though I have never done Pilates before this week. I enjoyed the videos and I feel that I got a good workout.",1382400000,,511,4.11
2784710,5,B000NVKZWY,"I love this workout, it's the cardio I needed during my pregnancy. I wasn't able to use the elliptical during my pregnancy so I was worried about not getting enough cardio but this was perfect.",1382140800,,193,4.542857142857143
2784711,5,B000NVKZWY,Erin really helped me challenge myself during pregnancy and helped to ease me back into myself after pregnancy.  I recommend it to all of my friends.  Very worth it.  You feel as though she is a very knowledgeable friend.,1380758400,,221,4.615384615384615
2784712,5,B000NVKZWY,"This is a great workout! Love Erin, she is realistic. Love the water breaks :) the workout is enough to make me a little sore but not too much that I feel like I'm over doing it. I'm very happy with my purchase!",1378252800,,211,3.9302325581395348
2784713,5,B000NVKZWY,"These 2 DVDs are awesome. I worked out daily with the prenatal fix DVD up until the last week of my pregnancy. Life with baby became so busy and chaotic, that I just got around to working out on 8.5.13 to the postpartum DVD. I seriously wish I had started it soon after hospital discharge; better late than never.

My husband thought I was ""post post-partum"" but my thought was this DVD can be a check-off to see if I'm ready to try other work out programs apart from walking around the neighborhood. The 1st and 2nd progressions were easy, but the 3rd progression kicked my butt.

As a result of this DVD, I've purchased 2 of her newer DVDs. O'Brien is phenomenal! She really targets your thighs, hips, & buttocks and abdomen - all of which seriously change with pregnancy. God bless Erin O'Brien!!! I've worked out with videos for 21 years and I have to say that Erin has been the best!",1375747200,,888,4.408536585365853
2784751,5,B000NVKZWY,"Prior to getting pregnant I worked out regularly (4-5 times per week), recently ran a half marathon and consider myself to be an advanced exerciser. However because of some early complications in my pregnancy, I was unable to continue running or my normal level of cardio. Most of the pregnancy workouts I found did not seem intense enough, I was looking for a pregnancy workout that was challenging enough to keep me at from losing too much conditioning during my pregnancy. Erin O'Brien's prenatal fitness fix was just what I was looking for. Erin is a personal trainer and is in her third trimester during the workout. She takes you through a series of low impact moves that keep your heart rate elevated enough to get a cardio workout and break a good sweat but without pushing it too much. She also includes toning exercises specifically targeted at your pelvic girdle and buttocks to help prepare your body for labor. I used this video 2-3 times per week and also walked 2-3 miles a few times per week up until I gave birth. I really felt this helped to limit my weight gain and helped make my labor easier. Also included is a partner workout and a post natal workout to help get you back into shape after birth. I am 4 weeks post-partum and will definitely be trying the post natal workout soon. As some of the previous reviewers mentioned, the DVD is filmed in her home and the production isn't great, it almost has a home-made feel to it. Plus the background music is kind of strange. But these things never bothered me because the actual workout itself was enjoyable and worth it. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a challenging pregnancy workout!",1374364800,,1673,4.617449664429531
2784752,5,B000NVKZWY,"It doesn't have corny music, dialogue, etc. She is real, to the point, encouraging, and easy to put on day after day without getting annoyed and wanting to rip her head off (hormones lol). Also, the workout is still difficult but not so much that you're worried about your baby. A great way to stay in shape without having to leave the house.",1371600000,,342,4.444444444444445
2784753,5,B000NVKZWY,"After I had my last baby, I LOVED the Postnatal Rescue exercise DVD. It has 3 15-minute segments that get progressively harder, so you start with the first and move up when it gets too easy. I found it especially helpful in regaining my strength after I had an unplanned c section. The exercises are very safe and gentle. I don't know what I would have done without these workouts. (Plus, you can't beat a 15 minute workout when you have a newborn and toddler - I would have never had time to do a longer one).

Now that I am pregnant again I can review the Prenatal Fitness Fix DVD! I am 17 weeks now, and it is one of my favorite workouts to do. It is 40 minutes, and a good mix of cardio, strength training, and some stretching at the end. Not easy, but not overly strenuous - perfect for pregnancy. Plus, she does lots of squats, which are great in preparation for childbirth! There is a 20 minute partner workout section on the end which I will probably never do. I'm happy with the main workout by itself, and I doubt my husband would really want to do the partner one with me anyways. :) My other favorite is Suzanne Bowen's Slim and Toned Prenatal workout. I will rotate these two for the duration of my pregnancy.",1371600000,,1222,4.29004329004329
2784754,5,B000NVKZWY,"This is my second pregnancy, and this time I was clever enough to work with this dvd from the get-go. In my first, I chimed in a bit too late, and the exercises were too hard for me - and I have been running and swimming regularly for over 12 years now!
This dvd is great because it actually challenges you. Erin's exercises are not tailored towards your trimester (that's the advantage of Summer Sander's dvd! It's a great idea to have both of them and alternate!), so you have to see for yourself which level of resistance you need to create. But apart from this, the overall program is great. I always do the warm up twice, so that I really get warm. At times, it is a bit annoying that she explains the exercises and does not take the time it takes her to explain from the actual exercise - since you watch her doing them over and over again, so you actually don't need the explanations after, say, the third time. But both her explanations and her constant reminders (to keep your posture, to breathe, stuff like that) help a lot to stay on track. For most exercises, her position is shown from various perspectives, so that you really know how to do it.

The prenatal exercise is also GREAT! I fondly remember doing it after my first son was born, and it really and truly helped me to get back into shape. Not too demanding, but very clever and helpful exercises.

Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about the partner-workout. Simply never tried it.

Overall, I highly recommend this dvd!!",1370390400,,1497,4.476190476190476
2784755,5,B000NVKZWY,"As a marathon runner I was heartbroken when my body refused to let me keep running during pregnancy. After YouTube-ing and doing some research I was terrified that most prenatal DVDs seemed to have low cardio workouts. For me, this DVD has been great. I'm 8 months pregnant now (been using this DVD 5 days a week since week 16), and I look great, feel great, still fit into my normal jeans (button open obviously), and still have better cardio than a lot of my friends and associates! Crucially, I feel that my body is in good shape for labor.

I can't comment on the post natal work out. However, if the prenatal DVD is anything to go by it's probably great.",1369872000,,659,4.401639344262295
2784756,4,B000NVKZWY,"A very useful exercise DVD especially during the winter months!! I think Erin is a great communicator, all up pretty good dvd thanks.",1368489600,,133,4.826086956521739
2784757,5,B000NVKZWY,"I am an avid exerciser and purchased this dvd for my second pregnancy. I also have ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout,"" which I also enjoy. That dvd has you use weights, where as the workout Erin O'Brien walks you through does not. Even so, I feel it is a great whole body workout that touches on all areas of the body. It does have some weird camera angles as other reviewers have mentioned but you get used to it and it doesn't bother or distract me at all.

Erin is a great trainer, motivating and funny, and I always feel better after doing her workout. I've been using this dvd since I was around 20 weeks (I'm 33 weeks now) and I plan to use it up until I deliver. I think for someone who doesn't normally workout this may be difficult, but as someone who does workout regularly, I find the workout to be just the right amount of challenging, but not too hard or too easy. I would recommend this dvd as it's a great way to stay in shape and prepare for labor!",1366502400,,961,4.194594594594594
2784758,3,B000NVKZWY,"I was of above-average fitness when I got pregnant and did my usual workout my 1st trimester.  I wanted to take things a little slower in my 2d, so I tried this and some other videos.  I liked this in my 2d trimester, but by my 3d as my knees were too shot to do a lot of her exercises (especially lunges).  It didn't help that she does squats & lunges early in the routine when I'm not yet warmed up.",1365120000,,401,3.925925925925926
2784759,5,B000NVKZWY,I love this DVD! I use it on days when I'm looking for a moderate workout and have been using it since I was 12 weeks along (now 18 weeks). Erin is energetic and motivational without being annoying at all. I would recommend this to other preggos.,1364947200,,246,4.25531914893617
2784760,2,B000NVKZWY,"This video was shot in the producer's living room and feels like it was rushed into production. While the exercises are solid (if you started pregnancy at a moderate fitness level), the terrible sound and video quality are just distracting and make it difficult to get through the routines.

2784774,5,B000NVKZWY,"I purchased the Erin O'Brien Prenatal Fitness Fix DVD (came with a postnatal workout as well that I will use later) and am VERY pleased with it. The workout is a bit hard for me to keep up with given I was not in good shape when I became pregnant. However, I tone it down a bit and still sweat and get a good workout. Hopefully by the 9th month I will be in better shape (5 months along now) and will be able to keep up better. Her demeanor is great and she gives just enough encouragement to keep you going. Unlike other exercise DVDs, she is not annoying and I enjoy listening to her while working out (I've used the DVD for the past 2 weeks, 5 days per week). I recommend this prenatal DVD :)",1360108800,,695,4.043478260869565

2784779,5,B000NVKZWY,"I looked for a long time for a decent prenatal exercise video.  I was on the low end of a moderate activity level before I got pregnant.  I enjoy a good workout but had gotten out of the ""habit.""  I was afraid to go back to my Turbo Jam for fear that it would be too intense to restart during pregnancy.  I am currently 19 weeks pregnant and feel that this video is perfect for my fitness level at this time.  It makes me feel good that I've done a workout but I do not get winded and overheated.  It is a good video for me to ""get used"" to working out again and build up to a higher intensity level.",1357948800,,600,3.9173553719008263

2784801,4,B000NVKZWY,"I like this video very much. In my first trimester I was too sick and tired to even think about exercise. This video was a nice way to ease back into a routine. The exercises are clearly explained and challenging enough for a recovering couch potato. I like that Erin is actually pregnant and that the focus is on building a strong, healthy body rather than staying skinny during pregnancy. The workout is low pressure, but I break a sweat and feel like my muscles are working. If you are extremely fit, you might find the workout too easy. For a fit-ish person who walks regularly and works out a few times a week, I think this video is great. There are a few elements to the production quality I could live without (music is a little weird in the beginning,80's style camera shots here and there, some cheesy jokes) but anything can be critiqued. This video is good where it counts.",1357516800,,884,4.462962962962963

She isn't annoying like some fake-smiling workout instructors. I rate it so high because of the instructor's energy, but I don't really like the filming. It seems like she was experimenting with different ways to film the workout, but in some portions you can see a weird outline of something in front of what you are viewing - almost like a watermark. It can get a little annoying at times. However, besides that one minor annoyance, I really enjoy this workout and find myself coming back to it regularly. There is a section where she works your butt while you are on the floor, and it KILLS the next day (in a good way). If you are looking for a high-energy workout that is low impact, this one is a great choice.",1357084800,,832,4.444444444444445

I bought it for my first pregnancy and probably won't use it much with my second pregnancy.  I'm a runner, running about 3-4 times a week, and do workout dvds at home twice a week.  I just wanted more of a workout, especially in the beginning. Oh and I never used the postnatal workout.  I tried it once and just turned it off.  By the time I was ready to start working out again, I again wanted more of a challenge.  There is also little cardio, it's more of strength training dvd.

2784843,4,B000NVKZWY,"The prenatal DVD actually wore me out too much, so I couldn't do it very often, so I was pleasantly surprised by the postpartum DVD. The bonus materials is quick, gentle stretches that really feel good and that you can do a few days after giving birth. Then there are 3 progressions of 15 minutes each (short enough to slip one in while the baby is napping and still have time to relax or do something else!).

I started doing the first progression about a month after giving birth, and honestly, I stopped because I really wasn't getting enough sleep and just needed to sleep and relax! I liked it, but I just had other priorities. Now the baby is 9 months old, and I've been doing it consistently for a few weeks and am on progression 2.

I'm amazed at how good I feel and how much more control I have over my abdominal muscles. I was fairly fit before and during the pregnancy and have tried different methods of exercise, and I'm very impressed by how my muscles are really getting stronger in a short amount of time, especially my core.

I do find some of the comments of the instructor a bit annoying (she tells you now that you're a mother, you can't eat fries or dessert, for example), but I like that she doesn't talk that much, she is encouraging, and it's in a living room setting. I even think it's cute that she thought to wear a baggy long-sleeved shirt in the first progression and then wear tighter shirts in the 2nd and 3rd. I guess she didn't want to make us feel bad by immediately seeing her muscular body when we are feeling exhausted not so muscular.

Overall, really glad I got the DVD set.",1330041600,,1613,4.348837209302325

But if you can get past that, it's a great buy.  I've only done the regular 40-min routine, because the partner one sounds ridiculous (although my husband promised to do it at least once, even if we just end up laughing the whole way through).  It gets your heart rate up, but not to the point of overdoing it; and it doesn't necessarily feel like a ""pregnancy"" workout - you actually feel like you're doing something productive, not just stretching and breathing.  I haven't tried the postnatal workout either, for obvious reasons, but it's nice to have something I know will be safe to do soon after having the baby to get back in shape.

Erin O'Brien makes me smile while doing this workout and makes the time fly by.  You don't need any additional workout equipment - just a coffee table, a chair, and a wall.

2784849,5,B000NVKZWY,"This routine makes me work harder than most, especially now that I'm in my third trimester (I've found that most workouts specifically designed for the third trimester aren't challenging at all, like the Lindsay Brinn workout, which I wouldn't wish on anyone). This DVD is great. The workout doesn't require any hand weights or resistance bands, you can easily do it in a smaller living room, and as long as you have a sturdy chair or coffee table, you're good to go! I find that her instructions are easy to follow, I only have to modify one of the moves (bad knee), and when I finish, I feel like I've accomplished something, yet do not feel strained or over-worked. I also love that she has four distinct segments that have me moving the entire time, but break up the monotony that most workout DVDs seem to have. The warm up actually warms you up well, as it's not as easy as others, and even the floor work keeps your heart rate up and is bit challenging (but not too much!). The cool down / stretching segment really feels good and again, isn't too easy.

My critiques are as follows: the menu music is annoying, you have to fast forward to the 3:00 minute mark to actually start the workout (I wish there was an expedited way to get to the workout), and, if you were to start this more towards the beginning of your pregnancy, it would probably get old fast as there is only one main routine. However, as I just started this workout in my third trimester, I think it will stay fresh and fun until I give birth.

Now I just need to figure out how to convince my husband to do the 20 minute partner workout with me...

(I also found the Summer Sander's prenatal workouts to be very good. That is the only trimester-specific workout DVD I have that I find at all challenging)",1315612800,,1779,4.401215805471125

Even with the cheesiness, this video is GREAT.  It's a good workout that will push you but not over your pregnancy allowance.  I also really enjoy the fact that it's kinda ""real"".  She's in a living room (not a studio), she's wearing normal cloths that you would actually wear to work out in at home, she uses furniture that most people have sitting around their living room, and she takes water/pee breaks!  It's fantastic!  I highly recommend this video.",1313884800,,647,4.517241379310345

It feels like she's in your living room (since she's in her's) and not on a far off aerobics production set.
The post-delivery progression workouts are incredible.  There are three stages you work through.  I had a C-section, so a progressing exercise routine was perfect for me.  Nice and slow going, but not easy . . . If I could, I'd give this video set to all my pregnant friends and family.",1313625600,,608,4.601851851851852
2784873,2,B000NVKZWY,"I was skeptical about this video, so I actually borrowed it from my local library.  For fitness videos, before purchase (unless it's under $10), I recommend either finding a clip on the Internet, or borrowing it from the library before purchase.  This one is one that I'm definitely glad I tried it before I bought it.

I""m sensitive to production.  One thing I like about my workout videos is being able to feel like I'm almost mirroring the person doing the video.  This was immediately impossible with this video, as that their were schizophrenic cuts between even just one extension movement - home video to grainy film close-up to silhouette front shot - all in 5 seconds.  I found this kind of production destabilizing when I was trying to balance.

The movements were also a little to quick to start at first. I take a bit of time to warm-up and get moving, and I felt like I was just being launched straight into needing to move quickly.

I wasn't impressed with this video at all, and returned it to my library as soon as I watched it.  It may be something that suits other people who can get past the production value, and like the instant intensity, but if you're like me, definitely check out a few clips or try the video from the library before you buy it.",1310169600,9,1269,4.482608695652174
2784874,2,B000NVKZWY,"This workout was way too advanced for me. I considered myself at a moderate fitness level, I would workout for 2+ hours at the gym a day for at least 4 days of the week, burning at least 800 calories each session. As soon as I became pregnant, I started working out with another video to stay fit. I didn't feel too challenged by the other video, so I decided to try out this one. I wish I didn't. After the first workout, which I couldn't finish because the lack of oxygen I was getting, I ended up with a pulled ligament in my abdomen. I was trying extra hard not to injure myself by doing the motions slow, but she moved way too fast for me, it was difficult to focus on the movements. In pregnancy workouts, they always tell you if you cannot finish a sentence while working out, you are doing too much and stop. Well, this happened the whole entire workout. I guess my fitness level wasn't as high as I thought it was, but I find it strange that with even non-pregnancy workouts that I chose to do instead of this one I was never injured once, and had better results.",1309564800,2,1072,4.20873786407767

2784878,5,B000NVKZWY,"The 40 minute prenatal workout is just the right duration and intensity.  It features a variety of moves,incorporating limbering, dance, yoga, and pilates.  Pre-pregnancy, I worked out on the Curves circuit and did weekly Zumba classes, but first trimester nausea prevented me from being active at all.  After three months of no exercise, I was glad this workout wasn't as intense as a Zumba class, yet I don't think it'll get too easy in time either (especially with an ever-growing belly!) My glutes and quads are usually a little sore the second day, which makes me feel like this workout is effective!  It seems like a good workout for the average woman.  Erin O'Brien is has a pleasant, frank, and funny personality. The DVD's music during the workout is very unobtrusive.  You do not need any workout equipment, just a typical living room: floor space, a coffee table, a couch, a wall, and a sturdy chair.  If you have hard surface flooring, you'll want a mat or blanket to lay on for the floor work.

If you really didn't workout prior to your pregnancy you may find this dvd to be a bit difficult, and due to the nature of the exercises involved the only ""modifications""  Erin really offers are to not use your arms (to lower your heart rate) or go a bit slower (if you find yourself panting). However, I would still recommend this program to anyone, as it will keep (or get) you in good shape for your delivery; just be patient with yourself and don't give up!",1301356800,,793,4.506944444444445
2784891,5,B000NVKZWY,"This is my favorite prenatal workout.  It actually gets me moving around a bit.  I'm not the super athletic type, but I've found most other prenatal workouts are downright wimpy by comparison when it comes to cardio, even for my standards.

The main 40-minute workout for Complete Pregnancy Fitness starts with an energetic warm-up and then moves to a ""Dynamic Movement"" section that really gets the heart-rate going (but not overdoing it) while keeping everything low impact.  Lots of lunges, squats, and some ballet movements that I found unique and fun.  These are interspersed with some strength training for the arms.  There is a brief section for floor work (on all fours or lying on your side, never on your back), followed by a stretch and relaxation segment.  Other things worth noting:

- Erin is great about explaining good posture and form with each movement.  Very important in keeping yourself and the baby safe.
- It is what it claims:  a complete workout.  A lot of emphasis is placed on core work and balance as you work other areas of your body at the same time.
- Challenging yet safe for all three trimesters.
- All exercises utilize furniture you'd find in your living room (coffee table, chair, couch, wall) as opposed to using weights.  This is great... unless you are working out in a home gym instead of a living room, in which case you'll have to get creative.
- My only real complaint about this dvd is the music:  elevator music style nursery songs set to a beat, which, half the time, is not in sync with the workout.  The good news is it's not very loud, so you can almost tune it out.  The workout itself is so good that I consider this nothing more than a minor irritation.

The 20-minute partner workout looks fun and challenging, not to mention a great way to bond with the baby's father. :)  I'll admit I haven't gotten around to doing it because I always get such a great workout from the main section, but it is nice to have the option.

I LOVE that there is a postnatal workout included as well.  Will post a review on this once I have a chance to use it.

UPDATE:  I tried the postnatal workout several weeks after delivery, and I HIGHLY recommend it, as it helps you safely ease your way back into exercise.  It's broken down into 3 progressive segments, all of which help to rehabilitate your muscles (especially abdominal). It only takes 15 minutes a day, and once you've mastered the third segment, you can feel safe in moving on to ""real"" workouts again. :)",1301184000,2,2501,4.560538116591928

They tend to treat the woman as though she's ill, not pregnant. Those videos tend to be terrific for women who didn't work out at a very intense level (or at all) before pregnancy, so there is a place for them in your routine if you find yourself in the beginner's category. However if you were fit to begin with and wish to maintain a reasonable level of fitness throughout your pregnancy, this DVD won't disappoint! Erin (who is pregnant in this DVD herself) does a great job of blending a good workout with prenatal tips, suggestions, modifications and water/bathroom break reminders. She's fun (doesn't take herself too seriously) and knowledgeable and not a bit annoying. I haven't tried the post-natal routine yet that she does with her hubby but I'll look forward to using it when the time comes.

I have never been a work out video person in the past (prefer the gym), but having some good workouts I could do at home were important during my pregnancy. Erin O'Brien is a more likeable and fun instrucutor than the perfect pregnancy video, so this was more enjoyable.  The other video I liked just because it really was a perfect workout that was difficult and guaranteed to keep me in shape. This video was a tough workout too, but great for all levels. I was initially worried about it feeling like it wasn't ""hard"" enough and that I was wasting my time - but not the case at all.  I have not watched the 2nd video (post-natal workout) but I am so happy with the first one and was worth it for that.  In fact, I can see me using some of the workout routine long after I'm pregnant.

2784894,4,B000NVKZWY,"After reading countless reviews, I purchased 3 prenatal exercise videos.  Since I noticed someone else reviewed three videos together, I thought I would do the same so you could compare these as well.

(For what it is worth, I'd consider myself to be in relatively good shape.  I like to do spin classes on the weekend at the gym and will also try to do some shorter workouts during the week.  When I first tried these videos at the end of my first trimester, I considered these to be good easy workouts.  Now that I am in the middle of my pregnancy I am appreciating the videos more since I feel limited as to what I can do.  I still do not feel like I am getting a fantastic workout after these (I prefer gym), but at least I know I am keeping in shape while pregnant.)

Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal Workout - If I were to pick only one of the videos, this is the one I would select.  I really enjoyed the mind/body component of the video while I was able to get nice overall toning through standing, mat and stretching exercises.

Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga by Elena Brower - I thought this was a very nice prenatal yoga video.  The setting of the video is beautiful and I found the poses to have a nice flow.  I liked it much better than anything in the Livingarts series I've tried and would say that it falls just under my favorite Power Yoga video from Rodney Yee.  The poses in here really are not that advanced, but I think they are geared nicely to what we can do as our belly progresses in size.

Complete Pregnancy Fitness with Erin O'Brien - I found this to be the best of the three for an aerobic workout.  I'd say it is primarily a toning video, but also does a good job getting your heart rate up in the process.  ...I think I would enjoy it more if Erin wore a shirt that covered her belly and staged it in a more professional environment than her home ;)",1299024000,2,1890,4.225626740947075

The exercises were good for both newbies and for people experienced in working out prior to pregnancy. You can choose how much/little you do along with her. I definately was sore from the work outs and enjoyed that she targeted the whole body work out and also worked on items that would come in handy with delivery and support as your body changes with growth.",1298419200,,468,4.390804597701149
2784896,5,B000NVKZWY,"I did this workout dvd for my first pregnancy and now my second pregnancy. I love it! I feel like it is an excellent workout, and the perfect length too... 40 mins. I can't go much longer than that while I'm pregnant, so it's just right! Erin makes it fun and I enjoy her personality. With my first pregnancy I had a start to finish labor of 4 hours, and I am convinced it is because I exercised throughout my pregnancy... and also because I got adjusted at the chiropractor on a regular basis. It's very important to stay healthy while pregnant, and this dvd certainly helps!!",1297123200,,577,4.401869158878505
2784897,5,B000NVKZWY,I put this in thinking oh no it's going to be cheesy but it ended up being a blast.  I'm in good shape and wanted to stay that way throughout pregnancy.  This is a great video for someone who is in good shape and wants to stay that way.  It might be pretty challenging for a beginner.  If I were a beginner I'd order this product and another easier to build up strength to this video.  I also have Lindsay Brin trimester series and I really love those for weight training/cardio mix.  I just bought this one for it's more solid nature in cardio and keeping the heart rate up.,1296172800,,575,4.181818181818182
2784898,5,B000NVKZWY,"I really enjoy this workout!  It offers some wonderful stretches that really help ease my back aches.  The workout is just the right intensity; the first time I did it, I could complete it fairly easily and was gently sore the next day.  I can feel it strengthening me over time.  My husband, who's in better shape than I am, loves to do this workout alongside me!  Just as my arms and legs start to get a bit tired, there's a break or change in activity.  It's just the right length, too, about 35 minutes.  I also agree with other reviewers that the instructor is pleasant to listen to.  She encourages without being hyper, and is very supportive about pregnancy and fitness.  I'm currently in my 6th month of pregnancy, and have done this workout around 15 times in the last month.  While my range of motion may decrease over my third trimester, I think I will be able to keep doing this workout up till the end of my pregnancy!

Activities include gentle stepping cardio, squats, reverse lunges, tricep dips, modified push-ups, leg lifts, and yoga and pilates moves.  For several activities the instructor will offer modified versions so you can do whichever version works best for your fitness level.

I haven't tried the Postnatal workout yet, but am planning to use both the Prenatal and Postnatal workouts to get back into shape after the baby arrives.

Highly recommended!",1295913600,,1381,4.7
2784899,3,B000NVKZWY,"I've been looking for a great prenatal workout video and have to say I think this one came up short. I prefer other videos that give you more options: workouts by trimester, express vs. full workout. It is definitely fast paced in the beginning so you have to give it a chance, but I can see this getting boring very quickly.",1295827200,,325,4.344262295081967
2784900,5,B000NVKZWY,"I loved working out to this DVD during my pregnancy. I kept my back pains down, strengthened my legs, helped me with balance, and feeling better overall. It didn't take long, and Erin's personality is great. She doesn't count outloud, so this may be for everyone if you need that cadenance. But once you go through it a time or two it is easy to follow. Great, great, great! Good baby shower gift for that girl who likes to work out.",1294876800,,433,4.3580246913580245
2784911,5,B000NVKZWY,"I am in my third trimester of pregnancy and was big into fitness and health prior to pregnancy. Weight lifting and general exercises are my fitness genre of choice with some Yoga thrown in maybe 1-2 times a week. When looking into prenatal workouts I came across yoga primarily. Some of the yoga dvds were good and some were useless. I am naturally very flexible also, so I have a harder time finding a challenging workout.

Anyway, all that to say I was excited my Mom bought me this set because it was more my style that actually got my heart rate up and I finished actually feeling like I got a workout. One thing I love about Erin's workout is that it is actually done in what looks like her normal living room. It has a coffee table, chaise lounge, couch, etc. like my normal living room would have. She actually uses them in some of her stuff also. It feels so real, unlike watching a video that looks like it was in some fitness warehouse room with tons of space.

I agree with another reviewer that the music is not annoying at all and she isn't overly peppy. It feels like I am working out with a personal trainer in my house. Also, she always shows modifications, proper posture, etc. so you aren't left wondering if you are doing the exercise correctly. This is a great prenatal workout and I recommend it. Lastly, the partner workout is great, because although it is short (which some folks prefer) you and your partner can communicate intensity level. Therefore, you can get an easier workout if you are sore from the day before or just aren't feeling all that energetic that day, or you can intensify it to get the workout you need.",1294185600,,1646,4.447019867549669
2784912,5,B000NVKZWY,I'm 14 weeks and didn't work out much in the first trimester.  This workout was challenging but I actually enjoyed it.  It went by pretty fast and I definitely worked hard.

I was in pretty good shape pre-pregnancy so I like that this keeps my heart going.  I also like the 40 minute timeframe...not too long not to short.  My husband and I also did the 20 minute partner workout which is a great short workout.  We laughed because some of the positions are a little awkward, but it was fun.  I really enjoy this DVD and hope you will too!",1289347200,,494,4.147368421052631
2784914,4,B000NVKZWY,"A lot of people are going to complain about this workout because it is intense. But I enjoy doing it daily because the instructor breaks it down for you into sections and little do you realize a while later that you have done a forty minute workout! The work out is pretty intense, but the instructor makes it clear that you don't have to go her speed when doing the moves. I certainly didnt! And then there are complaints that she doesn't explain how to do the moves very well, but in my opinion: When you've watched this over and over again you don't really want her to be explaining the moves, you want her to be moving through them. How difficult is it to rewind a little when you're starting off? I only gave it a four star because it is a pretty intense workout and for those of you who are feeling the pregnant fatigue, you will do this a few times and then give up on it. It would be better for those kinds of pregnant women to stick to something slower and simpler like pregnant yoga. But for those of you who can handle a lot of movement (and believe me, you are going to want to ask your doctor if you can work out to this), as long as you make it a point to press the start button I promise you will have no trouble finishing.

Good stuff--the instructor tells you specifically when to drink water, the workout is in sections designed to get your body revved up for a workout and then a cooldown at the end so you aren't pressing the off button and still huffing and puffing. She reminds you to take it at your speed but also shows you how far you can go if you are willing. She adds a DVD for when you are no longer pregnant to target the specific muscles to get you back on track to a pre-baby body!

Bad stuff--the workout is intense and not for everyone. The moves aren't explained too well, so you will have to rewind a few times unless you can catch on while she does it.

You'll have to decide if this is for you, but I have to say I'm very very satisfied and have had no problem working out almost daily (and I am a very lazy person). As long as I have the ability to press the play button on my DVD, I never walk away without finishing it.",1282262400,7,2160,4.101654846335697
2784915,3,B000NVKZWY,"It has been a particular challenge for me to find prental workout dvds that were safe, fun, and challenging.  This did not fit the bill.  It is just ok.  I am pregnant, not an invalid, and I want to feel worked out when I have done so.  If this had more reps of each exercise it would be better.  Not for ladies who are int/adv or better; more suitable for beginners or low intermediates.  I like Erin's demeanor and the video itself (no complaints about the ""homemade quality"" of production as some).  It just isn't for me.",1279152000,,524,4.34020618556701

I am not a fan of Erin's style (as a teacher) and the way the video has been done (poor luminosity and not a good edition) but the workout is good and very well explained. We can understand why we should do this or that excercise and what group of muscles we are woking out (which is important).

I recommend this dvd.",1268870400,,371,4.152777777777778
2784919,5,B000NVKZWY,I started using this workout DVD fairly early into my pregnancy and loved it. It's not a very challenging workout but is geared toward your pregnancy and what your body actually needs at that time. In addition to the DVD I walked 30min about 4 times a week. I had a very healthy pregnancy with healthy weight gain and I was very strong when it came to pushing that baby out! I would recommend this to any pregnant woman.,1265414400,,420,4.329113924050633

It wasn't a cakewalk, that's for sure, but I found Erin to be SO personable and easy to follow. I absolutely loved that she took bathroom and water breaks throughout the workout -- how many exercise programs on DVD have you seen that don't break for water? Pretty much every freaking one. So I found it refreshing that this one is so uniquely tailored to pregnant women. There's a great range of movement and intensity levels, so I didn't get bored and the 40 minutes just flew by. I can't wait to try the partner workout with my husband!! :)
Erin was incredibly encouraging, and I liked that she was doing the workout in her home instead of some gym setting; it made it seem much more comfortable. She also spent time discussing how, especially now, you shouldn't over-exert yourself, which was great -- she wasn't shouting about ""pushing"" yourself, she was constantly encouraging you to do your best and breathe.
With the great amount of information she gave me, I'm feeling really confident about continuing this workout program until my doctor says I should stop (if that even happens).

I would definitely recommend this to other mamas-to-be.",1264377600,,1375,4.725

This DVD is no joke!  I've been using the DVD for a few weeks now and my legs and bottom are usually extremely sore for the two days following this workout.  I've been doing the 40 minute portion of the workout and have been able to complete it each time.  I have not tried the 20 minute partner workout yet.  I would like to have my arms worked out more, but I'll have to ask my doctor if I can add small weights to this routine. I've been to the chiropractor twice already for lower back pain but it seems to disappear after finishing the workout. I'm completely satisfied with this DVD and would recommend for anyone.",1263427200,,792,4.211920529801325

I started the program while 5-month pregnant and found it somewhat easy. I wondered if I should have chosen a more challenging workout DVD, but I quickly changed my mind :)  Erin's positive attitude and the variety of exercises focused on major muscle groups kept me motivated until the last days of my pregnancy.

I cannot comment on the partner part yet. However, I' quite happy with the individual part, so I don't know when I'll be trying the partner video.",1260835200,,357,4.028169014084507
2784944,5,B000NVKZWY,"Ok, so I read reviews before purchasing this DVD and most said it was challenging.  I considered myself in decent shape and am only 11 weeks pregnant.  I had only been exercising REGULARLY for 6 months prior to getting pregnant, but have exercised on and off for 15 years.  This DVD is AWESOME.  The first time I did it, I was not able to complete every exercise...but the second time, I did....dripping sweat!!! I never felt that my heart rate went up too high, but I definitely got a workout.  Although there are no free weights involved, you use your own body weight to do some strenghth training.  I've only done the DVD twice now and both times my whole body is sore the next day...but in a good way!  I will do this all through my pregnancy and hope I can have as great as body as Erin!  She looks fabulous.  Like others have said, she is very real and down to earth and definitely not too ""peppy""!  Love it!  All you need is a chair! :)  Hope you enjoy this DVD as much as I have and will.",1260316800,,996,4.184210526315789

I chose this one because reviewers said it was a decent workout. I agree! I'm 13 weeks and I've continued to jog, and lift weights. I'm determined not to let pregnancy be an excuse to back out of workouts. I know I'll pay for it later if I do. Anyway, this is a great addition to your pregnancy workout. Lots of squats and lunges to work your glutes and quads really well. I'm happy I got this video and wanted to write this because I'm sure there are others that are trying to find a good yoga video that isn't a waste of your time.

I really FEEL GREAT after working out to this video (even on the mornings I'm feeling tired and queasy)!

My legs and butt still have that ""I worked out"" feeling the next day, which I enjoy.  I also like the fact that she reminds us not to go to fast or to slow down if needed.  The water and potty breaks are great too!",1256601600,,526,3.9056603773584904

But I ordered this video because of all the reviews about how it works on relaxation and stretching along with cardio. And it is amazing! I love it! It starts you out slow and it gets your heart rate up without killing you. And then it incorporates a lot of perfect pregnancy work outs and stretches that make me feel so great after the it is over. I also never feel bored or ready for it to be over before it is. The pace is really well suited for pregnant women and allows you to get the max or the min from the work out, whatever kind of work out you are looking for that day. I also think that Erin is a fabulous trainer. She talks to you and motivates you throughout the video. She also throws in some things here and there about what is important to remember when you're working out when pregnant and how to keep yourself safe and healthy.

2784952,5,B000NVKZWY,"I have tried a few pregnancy workout tapes, and this was BY FAR my favorite.

PREGNANCY VIDEO:

- Erin is motivating, fun, and entertaining.
- The workout is challenging but still doable for a pregnant woman (I did it up until my delivery date). It IS a workout (I'm pregnant, not unable to operate!).
- The partner section (which I did con my husband into doing with me a few times) is a good workout as well.

AS FOR THE POST-PREGNANCY VIDEO:

- I had an emergency C-section for my second baby, and was able to do the ""gentle first stretches"" section after coming home from the hospital... those stretches really did help and were easy. (It's a bonus feature on the DVD.)
- The three progressions of workouts are perfect for healing up... after my 6 weeks of rest, I started with segment 1 and was surprised at how hard such ""simple"" moves were (since Erin really targets the muscles you weaken during pregnancy and labor). After a couple weeks, I moved to segment 2, and I am still doing segment 3 and love the quick toning workout it is for abs, legs, and arms (my baby is now 6 months).

I HIGHLY recommend the pregnancy and post-pregnancy workouts by Erin O'Brien!",1252022400,2,1170,4.474178403755869

I got the video promptly and started right away! It is a great video she is thorough and takes her time as well as breaks throughout the workout. I also love the postnatal rescue it has helped me get back into shape after my little guy arrived. The 3 progressions are much needed and an easy way to get back to my old body! I would strongly recommend these videos.,1250640000,,505,4.270833333333333
2784955,4,B000NVKZWY,"This is actually a two DVD set which I didn't know when I bought it.  The Prenatal workout is pretty good.  It gets your heart going just enough so you know you are doing a workout.  After the first time or two I did the workout, I was sore in my legs.  Now that I do it pretty regularly, I don't get sore at all.

I don't do the couples workout so no comment there.  Looking forward to the Postnatal workout after the baby is born.

I've seen other reviews that kind of bash the music and the setting, but I like the living room setting as it shows me how to use my own furniture.  The background music is barely there so it's not annoying or anything.",1250208000,,653,4.046875

Erin is very real and if she can do it @ 8 months, you better be able to do it whenever in your pregnancy. I'm pretty out of shape and I find this video pretty easy.  I do this intermittently/along with other exercise like yoga, walking, etc. I love that it takes place in a pretty ordinary room... like a room you might be doing it in instead of some weird set. It makes it all that much more normal. Erin is fabulous- I would buy more of her videos. She's my new favorite workout video chick. She's so normal and inspiring.",1248825600,,782,4.248322147651007

My background is simple; I've been pretty lazy for the last year or so when it came to keeping in shape. When I found out I was pregnant, my doctor recommended that I get in to shape to help me and the baby. After researching, I decided to give O'Brien's course a go, as I am now in my 2nd trimester and past the nasties.

O'Brien is very spunky with a unique personality. She's very real and explains things very well. The camera work is a little differnt from standard videos, but I didn't find this distracting but more helpful in making sure I was doing things right. No moves were questionable, and she ofers modified versions of things if you're not quite up to speed yet. She also lets you know what you should and shouldn't do visually, as well for even allowing in bathroom and water breaks.

Intensity for a beginner that's out of shape: crazy! haha, I found that I couldn't even complete it, or keep up with pace my first few times, but this is okay, because I'm improving, getting into shape, and I feel great after the workouts! For those who were nuts about excersing, this may not be as intense but for those who've sat on their computer/couches like me, its great!

Also it has a partner helping routine on this disc, which me and my hubby do together. It is a nice touch I think because it lets daddy get to help in making sure things go great, and bonding of course! Good luck to all those trying to get in shape :D",1245456000,25,1517,4.2787456445993035

I felt like I was working out with a friend (sound weird, but true!). I like how the postnatal has 3 progressions to build your strength gradually.

LOVE IT!",1239753600,2,678,5.908163265306122
2784984,5,B000NVKZWY,"I tried tons of different videos while I was pregnant, but ended up just doing this one each day.  It was more challenging than the others but also short enough that I could make myself do it.  When I delivered, the Doctor was amazed at what great shape I was in.  I am now doing the postnatal workout which is great as well. I highly recommend this set, Erin is a wonderful instructor.",1239148800,9,386,4.260273972602739
2784985,5,B000NVKZWY,"This set is the most perfect workout set! I started the prenatal when i was 5 months and it was exactly what i needed. You get everything you would ever want- stretching, cardio, and strength training! And the even better thing is  the instructor is 7 months preggo! Now the postnatal was amazing! I cant put into words what a god send the postnatal workout was! THis is the only pregnancy workout program anyone needs!",1238716800,5,419,4.586666666666667
2784986,5,B000NVKZWY,"I bought three dvds to keep me in shape while pregnant.  This one, ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" and ""Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga with Jennifer Wolfe""

Of the three, this is the one I reach for daily. My Prenatal dvd skips, and the ""Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" is rigorous, but boring. I like this one because it's a good workout and I enjoy doing it daily.  I'm 34 and was jogging 2-3xs a week before I was pregnant. I stopped completely in my first tri (just too exhausted) and started using these dvds in my second trimester to get back into shape.

I have about 20 exercise dvds and this is the first one I've fallen in love with.  It feels like Erin is your own personal trainer in your own living room.  There's no pretense, no overly done lighting, and no fancy makeup.  The workout is fun, simple and effective.  Erin is down to earth, informative and real.  I also love that she's in her third trimester - very inspiring!

The workout is divided into 4 sections; warm up, dynamic movement, floor exercises and stretching/cool down.  She put a lot of thought into this dvd, there are water and pee breaks. She is pregnant with her second baby here, and it is clear that she designed this workout to prepare you for CHILDBIRTH. Lots of lower body moves, kegels and cardio (with her always reminding you to make sure you aren't panting).

Unlike a lot of exercise dvds it is very clear that Erin teaches classes regularly.  She's very experienced, knowledgable and communicative.
I don't live in southern California anymore, but I wish I did so I could seek out her gym and take her classes.  I can't tell you how much I love this dvd.",1238371200,9,1636,4.520408163265306
2784987,4,B000NVKZWY,"Before I became pregnant I was doing Taebo, kickboxing, and lots of weights & cardio at the gym (about 5-6 days I week I worked out).  Once I found out I was pregnant I knew I needed to be more gentle with my body so I purchased several prenatal videos.  This one is one of my favorites (the other 2 I like a lot are 'The Perfect Pregnancy Workout' & Hotmama's Challenging prenatal workout with Terri Bryant).  I have found that no prenatal videos work me as hard as I am used to but I guess that is the point.  This dvd recording looks a little amateurish but gives a pretty decent workout so I can over look that.  Overall I would recommend this as a good solid prenatal workout for any one in any trimester.",1238025600,4,710,4.1911764705882355
2784988,5,B000NVKZWY,"I am currently 4 months pregnant and just started this workout last week.  I was active prior to pregnancy, so having some knowledge of dynamic movements including squats, yoga and pilates will be helpful for some of the moves in the Prenatal workout.  I wouldn't reccomend this for someone who is just starting to exercise who has never done some of the above listed activities - but if you do, take it slow!  Erin is a good instructor who explains the moves as you are doing them and is motivating.  I recommend this to any expecting mother who still wants to keep those muscles strong while maintaining flexibility during pregnancy!  It's also a great mood booster!",1237939200,2,668,4.724137931034483
2784989,5,B000NVKZWY,Great workout.  She's not shrill or silly but is still fun.  The partner part is really cool too.,1235692800,,97,4.333333333333333
2784990,5,B000NVKZWY,"I first discovered Erin's video at our library and found myself checking it out so much that I decided it was worth buying, so I bought the combo pack with the postnatal workout(I'll let you know how that one is). I love that she does the workout at home with only the props we all have in our living rooms (couch, table, ect). The workout is only 40 minutes which is easy to fit in anytime. I often find myself working in the video between tending to dinner. I definitly work up a sweat, and can feel my mucsles the next day. She's also pretty funny and the transitions are great and I like the combination of strength training, pilates, and yoga. I highly recommend this video. It's by far my favorite, and I find myself doing actually looking forward to it!",1235174400,,760,4.359154929577465
2784991,4,B000NVKZWY,"I really like this workout DVD. Well worth what I paid for it. I use it almost everyday. Erin has a cute personality and makes you feel like you are in an aerobic class with an instructor. The only thing I don't like about it is that she goes through every move and set like it's the first time you've ever done it so you have to wait for her to explain the moves all over again everytime. I think it would have been better if there was an instructional section guiding you through the moves first then the actual workout so that you can quickly go through the workout rather than waiting for the explanations every single time. (Hope that makes sense) It does get annoying after you've done the video about 3 times. I guess the good thing is that she does take the time to explain exactly how the move is supposed to be done to avoid injury. Also, she has special training on exercise during pregnancy so I always feel better knowing that the moves are safe to do and not going to harm me or the baby.
The video is broken down into sections with the warm up being first, strength training (which includes a little cardio- just enough to get your heart rate up but not break a sweat) then the cool down. I have only had the video a little over a month but can tell a difference in my energy level as well as with my lower back pain. It really does help to move around and strengthen those muscles. It also helps me to keep my weight gain in check, which is a big issue for me.
I would say, if you are a beginner or intermediate exerciser, buy it. It's not too difficult but gets you moving so you feel better and more energized.
Good Luck!",1234396800,4,1639,4.189873417721519
2784992,5,B000NVKZWY,"Excellent program for the more advanced exerciser & mom to be.  Perfect combo of cardio, resistance & stretching.  Love it!",1233792000,,123,5.1
2784993,3,B000NVKZWY,"This is a really thorough, challenging work out.  It's filmed in kind of a funny way, but once you figure out what's going on, you get over that.  The reason I gave it three stars is because it might not be the best PRENATAL work out.  She is constantly talking about ""getting your heart rate up,"" when you need to be cautious about your heart rate during pregnancy.  My heart rate easily got to 150 during the dynamic movement section of the video.  My midwife recommends no higher than 130.  If you are in really excellent shape pre-pregnancy, then you might be fine.  I was in pretty good shape, but doing this video full out is too much and makes my heart rate too high.  If you weren't exercising much at all pre-pregnancy, this video is definitely not for you.",1233532800,7,766,4.421428571428572
2784994,4,B000NVKZWY,"I too found the lack of professional quality a little off putting at first.  I was totally intimidated watching the dvd.  I had placenta previa the last part of first trimester and early second.  So, I just got back to excercising at week 26.  However, when I did the moves, I found it to be easy.  I fast forward the parts I don't like and do the ones I can.  I love that she makes you drink water and there is even a pee pause.  I thought that was hilarious!  The workout was good; I actually feel a little sore tonight after doing it today.  It is good to have in my mix.  The best part is watching the partner workout with her husband, actor James Denton.  He looks about as excited about it as my husband would.  Be sure and watch it!!  Really cute.  They seem like a normal, sweet couple.",1232236800,,794,4.1381578947368425
2784995,4,B000NVKZWY,"Great workout. Not to intense, but you feel like you've done something. She's very reassuring and relaxed. Like that the ""studio"" is her living room, so you feel like you're right at home and that you're doing the right thing in your own living space. Got a Post-natal DVD too. Well worth it!",1232236800,,292,4.528301886792453
2784996,1,B000NVKZWY,"This lady seems to think of pregnancy as something to fix and get past as quickly as possible. From her blog:

""The main reasons to continue exercising through your pregnancy include: 1) Less weight gained = less weight to take off after the baby is born 2) You will have a smaller baby, which is easier to give birth to 3) You will endure labor better.""

Is she concerned about her looks or about her baby? I can't tell.",1231977600,6,421,4.3164556962025316

I didn't notice at first, but it comes with 2 DVD's, one for prenatal, other for postnatal. That's pretty cool!",1230854400,2,389,4.402777777777778

Up until that point, I continued to do my normal pre-pregnancy workout rountine which consisted of a total fitness class twice a week as well as walking, running and ab work every day.  I have found this video a great replacement for my total fitness class.  It is challenging enough that I still feel like I am getting a workout, but it also provides me with a comfort level that I am doing the right exercises for me and the little guy.  I bought this video based on the reviews, and now I can also add that I love it too.  Erin will definitely be my companion for the next 10 weeks.",1229558400,3,643,4.195121951219512

2785021,4,B000NVKZWY,"Overall I like this DVD. She is high energy but not annoying...and she really gets you moving! I was actually surprised at some of the exercises - lots and lots of squats. But since she is pregnant too, it inspires you to keep up.",1224806400,2,230,4.25
2785022,4,B000NVKZWY,"I am 37 years old and 5 months pregnant with my 3rd child. I just started this workout 2 days ago.  I have exercised all my life though not always consistently.  I had only been walking about 3 to 4 times a week before starting this DVD after finding out I was pregnant. Previously I would follow the Weight Watchers DVD's or go to the gym and walk/run on a treadmill with some strength training.  I am alternating days with Erin and Nancy Popp's Prenatal Quick Fix.  It is very easy to follow and I feel refreshed at the end.  I only have a few minor issues with the DVD... she stresses the water intake which is great but they have a few up close and personal shots of her face with her mouth on the bottle.  I really think this could have been left out.  I think it is suppose to make you thirsty but it turns me off a bit.  The other is the sound.  She is in what looks to be like a den with wood floors and the sound is not very clear.... it sounds muffled at times.  She also has a few moments on some exercises where she is not saying what she is doing.  For instance the cat stretch segment... it is hard to be on all 4's and look at the TV... she is very quiet during this segment so I had a hard time following this part.  Overall, I think the workout is worth the 40 minutes... there is no jumping or really difficult moves.  I have not watched the couple workout and probably won't because I prefer to exercise on my own.",1224115200,,1433,4.056939501779359

My complaint is there is too much talking before it actually starts, even comments during the workout get a little annoying.

So, I got this DVD, and I'm completely satisfied. At first, the exercises seemed easy (for a person who's worked out before), but I have to tell you - as the pregnancy progresses, the instructor definitely manages to get you sweating! I'd most certainly recommend this to my friends. Try it!",1219968000,,422,4.423076923076923

You can sweat if you do everything as she says on the video. There is no cheesy baby stuff in the video, and she's really pregnant which is good, not some skinny girl telling you how to do prenatal exercises. I didn't care for the couples session and there was a Postnatal video which I didn't even know was part of this so that was a good surprise (i haven't even looked at the postnatal one yet)",1219536000,,575,4.142857142857143

I was NOT a regular exerciser before pregnancy, but decided to start due to gestational diabtes and general over-all health.

I am having a hard time breathing with my pregnancy so I have to pause for breaks, and maybe even stop the video at times but only because of my workout level.

This video will get your blood pumping and will work all of your major muscle groups.  The instructor is very pleasant, does not have any sort of strange accent, and there isn't really any unnecessary and excess dialog.  The video is well-organized, with sections for warming up, working out different muscle groups, and then for cooling down.  I also liked that the instructor is situated in her own living room.  I felt like I was right with her, while doing the exercises in my own living room :)",1216598400,,674,4.575

2785056,5,B000NVKZWY,I started this workout at 24 weeks and I think it is great for all areas of the body!  I love the fact that Erin includes water breaks throughout the workout and I think the music selection is very appropriate.  The workout doesn't drag on either...the 40 minutes is over before you know it!  The 20 minute partner workout is fantastic too...my husband even enjoyed it!

I am now 20 weeks along and feeling better, so I figured I should get back into working out.  This video is great.  There are a lot of moves that you would do in an aerobic class at the gym, but there are also a lot of modified moves for being pregnant.

But this time, because of this DVD, I have much better appetite, no headache, and feel much more energetic.  I also tried Fitmama, which is also good.

She is very down to earth and keeps you going through the whole thing, she challenges you without pushing you over your limit and constantly reminds you to push your self on a level from 1 to 10 to about a 7.  She keeps it real.  The music isn't bad at all, you only even realize what your listening to a few times through out the video.  She has a soothing voice, reminds me of Sarah Jessica Parker.  I was in shape before I got pregnant but I had such horrendous morning sickness, I'm 16 weeks right now and I was sick from about 8 weeks to 14 weeks, so now that I'm feeling better I wanted to get in shape again.

Otherwise its awesome and has a great focus on the warm up and cool down. I would definitely recommend it to any other mom's!,1207526400,,337,4.2
2785088,4,B000NVKZWY,This a great workout no matter what your fitness level is.  I enjoy using the tape and will continue throughout my pregnancy.  It was a fun workout and you can feel it working as well.  I liked her personality too.,1206921600,,214,4.3
2785089,5,B000NVKZWY,"I'm a second time mommy-to-be who still runs and regularly does yoga and other prenatal workouts - I thought this workout would be easy but I was pleasantly surprised! The leg work (inner thigh and derriere) is especially good, and I find my muscles are still sore (in a good way) the following day. There is not nearly as much arm work as Karyne Steben's ""Perfect Pregnancy Workout,"" so I alternate them. True, the electronic version of ""Frere Jacques"" that plays during the menu is grating, but the music during the workout is barely noticeable. I love the length of the workout, too - it's 40 minutes broken up into warmup, dynamic movement, floor work, and stretch and relaxation sections.

Other reviewers don't like the ""homemade"" feel of the production, but I do - Erin O'Brien is down to earth (no makeup, incorporates time for water and bathroom breaks), not overly peppy, but still encouraging and upbeat. She's also challenging - I find a lot of these prenatal workouts too coddling, I like being pushed. I found myself in a great mood after finishing this.

I have mentioned this in other reviews of pre- and postnatal workouts, but I have had two very easy pregnancies (so far) and a very easy first delivery and recovery. Two doctors attributed that to my exercise pre-, during, and postpregnancy. I am determined to exercise as much as I can for this pregnancy, too (my little guy seems to like it, too). Mommies to be - get out there and exercise! You will be so grateful you did! This is a great workout to get you going.",1206662400,47,1538,4.6300366300366305
2785090,5,B000NVKZWY,Great program! Not boring at all like many fitness programs out there. Erin gets your mood up and your blood moving. I love the homestyle setting of the video - it makes you feel like you can do it easily. And actually you can - the program is pretty easy to follow. Overall - I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1205712000,,300,4.280701754385965
2785101,5,B000NVKZWY,"This is the best prenatal work out video I've tried!  I love the 40 minute length because I feel like I've actually done something but without having to make time for an hour long workout. The program is easy to follow and multiple video angles help you to make sure you are using proper form when doing the moves. I was exercising 5-6 days a week before becoming pregnant and this video still feels a little challenging physically for me, but in a good way. You need very little space to do the work out and the only prop you need is a kitchen chair for a few moves.  But be warned....this lady really likes squats and the Pilates portion at the end looks easy but your butt will be sore for days the first time you do it.",1205712000,,723,4.194244604316546
2785102,5,B000NVKZWY,"This DVD is awesome, I love the fact that it is in her home, it provides a very down to earth, comfortable feeling that we all need as people, not just expecting mothers. To know there were no actors or props amd fake smiles and music like most aerobic tapes, made this my favorite. I loved every bit of it. This is my first pregnancy and I am far from a beginner exerciser and Erin's 4 section DVD made me feel great!

She teaches and guides you through every step as well as continues to make sure your breathing, posture and safety are on point, so don't worry if your concerned about all that being done right, she will definitely make sure you are.

It is a great DVD set (2) and a great price, I loved the quality as well as the video graphics that added to the positions and stances she did, it allows you to again make sure you are doing everything right. This is awesome!

I hope to continue adding her to my daily exercise collection, even after my daughter is born.

2785103,5,B000NVKZWY,"The most amazing pregnancy video. It's no ""warm-up"" and she's just in her own home, challenging you with lots of strength training squats and lundges. I love this video!",1204243200,,169,4.862068965517241
2785104,5,B000NVKZWY,This is a great workout for those of you who want to feel like you've worked out but you don't want to overdue it. It may be a bit fast pased for beginners but very easy to follow and learn. Great for those who are used to daily workouts. Makes you feel GREAT when you're finished and really helps cramping and fatigue. It's one of my favorites!,1201219200,,345,4.164179104477612
2785105,3,B000NVKZWY,"This DVD set is okay, though it doesn't feel very professional.  It really is filmed in her living room and the camera work and lighting are not at the professional level of most other exercise DVDs. It's a bit expensive for the quality.  The workouts are good. I was challenged and the gal is a good leader.  The partner workout basically used the man as a prop. He doesn't get to do much.  If you are looking for a workout specifically designed for pregnancy, this will do just fine.  But if you are in tune with your body, just about any exercise tape will do the trick. It's just up to you to adjust it to your needs.",1201132800,4,621,4.228813559322034
2785106,5,B000NVKZWY,"This is a wonderful workout video for moms-to-be that are used to being very  active.  My body always feels great after finishing...even if it's a little tougher on some days than others.  Also - my husband and I really enjoy the partner workout.  He loves having an opportunity to cheer me on for keeping a healthy body during my pregnancy.

This, along with yoga, have kept my legs and back strong and happy so far!  Have fun and enjoy!",1199404800,,438,4.481012658227848
2785107,4,B000NVKZWY,This is a good workout that gets your heart going without over-doing it.  She's very matter-of-fact.  It could probably use some different music (I'm a little sick of hearing that electronic French lullaby) but overall a nice workout without being too long!,1199145600,,257,5.095238095238095
2785108,4,B000NVKZWY,"I really like this video for the prenatal workout.  I really like how she is really down to Earth and doesn't make you feel really out of shape, because she is panting right along with you.  The exercises are easy, yet effective.  She also uses a great variety of workouts including some yoga and pilates.",1198886400,,305,4.509090909090909
2785109,4,B000NVKZWY,"I have to say, at first when I heard the music for the video, I was thinking this is going to be a cheesy cookie-cutter dvd.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with Erin's down-to-earth, tell it like it is attitude.  The workout was nicely done and it really made me feel relaxed after working out.

I definately recommend this to anyone who is expecting.  I have yet to try the other side for after the child is born...I will fill you in on that in June! :)",1197417600,3,460,4.252873563218391
2785110,5,B000NVKZWY,"I normally cannot stand work out videos but knew I should do something besides walking to keep my fitness level up.  I was pleasantly surprised by this video.
1.  Erin O'Brien is not irritatingly peppy, but realistic and down to earth.  There is very little excess dialogue, which I appreciated.  She imparts just the right amount of info and throws in a few extras about physiology and anatomy, which I appreciated.  Plus there are water and pee breaks! ( which I really needed)
2.  The workout is probably best suited for someone who has done a few classes before and has at least a moderate level of fitness.  But I suppose a beginner could simply watch it a few times before attempting if it were a bit too fast paced for them.  She adds modifications for times when the heart rate is too high, which is nice.  I thought at first it would be too easy for me, but oops.  It got me!  (in a good way, of course)
3.  The workout is complete, I thought, especially given it's timeframe of only 40 minutes.  That includes a short stretching session afterwards, which made me feel really good.
4.  The production value was great -judicious amount of camera angle changes and fades, making it easy to copy her body mechanics. Simple set-an average, well lit living room.  All the props she used were standard furniture.  I had to make some small adaptations but all were easily accomplished.
5.  Best of all-unobtrusive music,  used mostly to provide rhythm.  No trendy production, no silly  distracting lyrics, just background percussion oriented music at a nice soft volume  (Although I really dislike the music that plays for the menu, but that doesn't matter)
OVERALL:  I highly recommend this work out video and look forward to using the post-natal DVD as well.",1194912000,100,1762,4.689542483660131
8181801,2,B000NVKZWY,"The workout itself is pretty good. BUT the instructor isn't my cup of tea..
She goes too fast with movements where it feels unsafe for a pregnant woman with balance issues associated with being pregnant.  She makes a lot of weird noises and body movements that remind me of OLD exercise videos.
The camera angles and video quality stink and its just sort of weird.
However. Once I got past all that I do enjoy most of the workout and just go at a pace that I can and do things safe. It is a good ""guide"" but one of my least favorite DVDs.",1491782400,,538,4.173076923076923
8181802,5,B000NVKZWY,Great prenatal DVD. Was engaging and the time went so fast. Would totally recommend!,1489104000,,84,5.071428571428571
8181803,2,B000NVKZWY,"I really wanted to love this workout as much as some of the other reviewers did, but it was just not for me. Some background on my pre-pregnancy fitness level and routines: I was very fit and working out 5-7 days a week doing intense fitness programs like P90X3 and 21 Day Fix Extreme. When I got this workout video I had just about 2 weeks before reaching my 2nd trimester and had decided to try a dedicated prenatal fitness program so that I wouldn't have to modify my normal workouts so much.

So why just 2 stars? First off, the pace of the moves was too rapid for me. As in the instructor is very petite and can physically just move her body a lot faster than my 5'10"" frame can move. Even with me moving at close to my fastest pace, by the time the instructor finished a move I felt as if I had barely gotten started. Secondly, I found the artistic video effects (the camera angles, lighting changes, and other visuals) very distracting. Third, I didn't jibe with her motivational talk or her tone of voice, but I do realize that it is a very personal preference. Lastly, having been very fit before starting this workout, I just found that this didn't meet my needs for an all-in-one cardio plus strength training workout. It felt too disconnected and I didn't feel like there was an effective arrangement of the exercise sequencing. This may be because I had been working with highly organized workouts designed to maximize results for specific muscle groups or purposes (cardio, recovery, flexibility, etc.) each workout.

It wasn't for me, but it may right be for you. I hope that my review helps you to determine that. As for me, I've gone back to 21 Day Fix Extreme with modifications or substitutions for some of the moves and I'm much happier.",1484611200,2,1757,4.522012578616352
8181804,4,B000NVKZWY,Great video for when I was pregnant and needed to work out at home.,1467849600,,67,3.857142857142857
8181805,1,B000NVKZWY,"This workout video is strange! There is techno-lullaby music in the background (I kid you not!) which is creepy. The production is horrible, with strange shots and effects cut in randomly, which is distracting. I don't need to see a close up of her drinking water! The workout is ok, but it's too hard for me to focus on it. There are so many great prenatal workout videos out there, so stay away from this one! I couldn't finish it once because it was too annoying!",1463097600,,466,4.430232558139535
8181806,2,B000NVKZWY,This is not for anybody who wants to work out seriously. If you are a mom to be and did not work out before you were pregnant and feel like you were a little out of shape this would be great because it's very slow but honest to God the sweat series that's available on Amazon is much much better its called expecting more. Also they shot this did not properly white balance the whole thing is yellowish and there's just not a lot of tough activity. I think this might be a good suggestion for say maybe your last month of pregnancy where you just need to get moving but I'm at months 7 so I can still do a lot although a little modified so this was just not for me.,1453420800,,665,4.007518796992481
8181807,5,B000NVKZWY,I've only used the 40 minute pre-natal video but I found it easy to follow along and tough enough that I was a little sore the next morning in the thighs.,1453248000,,154,4.0

8181809,2,B000NVKZWY,"MAybe you have to be really fit and have done lots of excercise before you got pregnant, it is difficult, it seems she is in a hurry to finish it and does not take the time to explain carefully.",1438646400,,194,4.0
8181810,5,B000NVKZWY,Love this dvd. Short and fun work out. And the lady is fun. Not at all boring.,1437004800,,78,3.6470588235294117
