8526216,5,B0089BSLGM,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

As often happens, ""copy protection"" attempts on the disc causes some problems. I had a few glitches in the movie in the first one or two minutes. The problems did not repeat.

Lynn Bari is 110 in the shade!!

Great Movie !!",1488844800,,594,4.547169811320755
8526217,4,B0089BSLGM,Excellent WWII story of spies. I enjoy the B movies from the 40's and early 50's. This story kept my attention. Price was right.,1424131200,3,128,4.375
8526218,5,B0089BSLGM,"Good B&W  picture, very clear and no fuzzy images.
Plot is good and keeps you guessing as to who the real bad guys are.
1940's WWII plot with good acting. Good enjoyable flick.",1401235200,4,176,4.333333333333333
8526219,4,B0089BSLGM,"If you enjoy forgotten, over the top WWII programmers, then here's a fast little B- Fox picture from the 1940's. Assembly line stuff, but still fun.

Fox appears to have made a fresh transfer of this film as contrast levels and image detail are excellent. Very film-like. If you're a fan of this movie, then you should be pleased. I guess my only complaint is, why don't they all look this good?!",1348704000,7,396,4.5
