4406126,3,B004LWZW2E,"Insidious is a well crafted and acted haunted house film, but it didn't quite pack the scares that the reviews I had previously read led me to believe. Don't get me wrong, sitting in a dark theater with the sound jacked up provided a couple of tiny jolts in my case, while a woman in the back screamed out loud at least once. Most of the scares are of the cheap variety (though some were very well done), but they are implemented with really loud sounds and music crescendos, so it does the trick more often than not. Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you. In the right hands, in this case James Wan, it will have you bracing for impact whenever things get a little too quiet.

The story is about a couple with three young children. They move into a new home and almost right away they know something isn't right. One of their sons goes into a coma of sorts and they learn that evil spirits are trying to break out through his unconscious body. I liked the ""Poltergeist"" approach of the son being haunted and not the house. No matter where they go, as long as the boy is with them, evil will be there as well. The first and second half of the film are so different, I think a lot of people will be split on which is better. I liked the slow building and rather typical haunted home vibe early, but I also thought the other dimension aspect and explanation used later was well done too, minus a couple of scenes that weren't pulled off to their full potential (like Darth Maul demon, hence the title of this review).

If you haven't already, check out The Changeling with George C. Scott (or better yet, buy it here for less than $6.00). It's an often overlooked ghost story from 1980, but it proves the less is more approach is almost always more effective than the in your face technique. The sance scene alone is one of the most chilling I've ever seen. Insidious doesn't measure up to it, but I would still recommend watching it on a dark and stormy night, preferably with the lights off and your surround sound turned to 11.

3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1302912000,2,2052,4.310880829015544
4406127,5,B004LWZW2E,"nsidious... wow, what can I say.

It starts with the title... what does it mean? It rings through your head. Insidious... insidious... it's a fascinating word. It means
""Proceeding in a gradual, subtle way, but with harmful effects"". One should wonder, ""why is it called Insidious?""

I was excited about this film from the moment James Wan announced it. I am a fan of him and Leigh Whannell, and have been since Saw. Dead Silence was scary as hell and Death Sentence was pure fun. When I saw the trailer, I was so excited, and anticipated opening day.

This film will grab you right from the opening shots and its opening titles. James Wan knows how to set the mood for an experience that will fill you with fear and dread, and Insidious is proof. The cinematography is excellent and atmospheric... boasting a mostly muted and gray look, Wan's visual style sure is eye-catching and creepy.

The film's plot revolves around a family of five- A married couple, Josh and Renai, a teacher and musician and their children. Having just moved into a new home, they seem to have a perfect sense of belonging. However, one night, the eldest child, Dalton, bumps his head after falling off the ladder and is soon in a comatose state.

Three months later, creepy stuff begins to happen. Ghosts can be seen. Break-ins occur. They move to Josh's mother's place, but even that doesn't help. Soon, they find out it's Dalton that's haunted- not the house, as he is stuck in a realm called The Further!!!

Insidious is creepy and good fun. If you're expecting jump scares every 5 minutes, you will be disappointed. This movie is largely tension based, and jump scares are minimal. Wan brings back what horror is about- being SCARED. To feel fear... to dread what's coming next.

The performances are great too- Wilson is excellent, and so is Rose Byrne. Also turning in a good performance is Leigh Whannell-
undoubtedly the show stealer- as the geeky and hilarious Specs. He and his buddy Tucker provide the comic relief (the flashlight scene was hilarious!!!).

In short, Insidious is a success. Wan and Whannell clearly love being scared as much as we do, and it shows. To James Wan: Touche. Thanks so much for showing what horror is about!!!",1301616000,7,2227,4.721649484536083

It worked here ... guess we learn something new everyday.  That said, ""Insidious"" is an imaginative mash-up of haunted house and possession tropes, with a good dose of H.P. Lovecraft (esp. the Randolph Carter stories).  With nods to much better films like The Shining, The Exorcist, Amityville Horror, etc., director James Wan does a good job with building suspense, while keeping everything nice and neat for a PG-13 rating.  I thought it was a little dull at times (we've seen this all before), but it was a big hit with its target demographic (teens), and considering it cost $1.5M to make, and grossed $97M worldwide, I expect there will be many sequels (so far there are 3).

I recently watched the 4th installment (Insidious: The Last Key) and it links back to this one, so I had to revisit it and watch it again. I am a HUGE horror fanatic and I am pretty seasoned - so it takes a lot to actually scare me. This movie scares me every time. The ""woman"" ghost is absolutely terrifying. The very first time I watched Insidious, I had trouble sleeping alone for an entire month, no joke. But that is amazing and delightful! This movie has it all - a slow burn, a good story, characters you feel for, a touch of humor, increasing dread and tension, horrifying ""monsters,"" etc. I still love the **** out of this movie, now 7 years later!! I nearly foam at the mouth every time the name James Wan is attached to a movie because of this one (and Saw of course). Love this movie SO much.",1517011200,,865,4.18562874251497

the plot

The Lambert family had just moved into a new home when Josh recently acquired a teaching position in this new town. His wife Renai writes music, and they have three young children. There are strange happenings and noises throughout the house even on their first day in the home. Boxes are inexplicably moved, noises resembling whispers can be heard in the attic. Dalton, the oldest child hears these voices as well, and he decided to follow the sonic trail up into the dark attic. He tries to switch the light on, but its out of reach. He climbs a ladder to get higher and when he spots something in the dark corner, it startles him; he falls off of the ladder and falls unconscious. When Josh runs up the stairs to the rescue, he finds that Dalton cant wake up. The doctors cannot explain his condition, its like a coma, but it isn't a coma.

 When they bring Dalton home for home care, the noises are now amped up to strange appearances of strangers and creatures. Renai is usually home when she is confronted with these apparitions, as Josh claims to be grading tests until somewhere around 11pm every night. When they start to happen more and more, and she convinces Josh to move the family immediately, and they do. Sadly, this move doesnt halt the paranormal activity, in fact it seems even more frequently than the first house. Joshs mother Lorraine came over to the new home and was frightened by a dream she had the night before about how the house is haunted. They contact a paranormal expert named Elise to help them with this situation. She explains that Dalton has the ability to travel via astral projection while sleeping. This time he traveled too far, and the ghosts flock to Daltons body as he is like a conduit. Josh, the father may have a secret as well.

the breakdown

insidious [in-sid-ee-uhs]*
adjective
1. intended to entrap or beguile:
2. stealthily treacherous or deceitful:
3. operating or proceeding in an inconspicuous or seemingly harmless way but actually with grave effect:

 My younger brother recommended this film to me. I asked him if he thought it was scary, he replied with something like, meh. To me, I translate that as not so much. More evidence is that the film has a PG-13 rating, when we all know that the best horror flicks are at least rated R. Well, not anymore. I found Insidious to be very scary. I watched it alone, which made it even scarier. On the bright side, I love being scared by good horror movies. Initially, I put off watching it for a while, but when I found that Rose Byrne stars in this, I was more anxious to watch it. She is a very sexy Australian actress, whom I am used to seeing in comedies, but she was very good in this genre and she should do more in my opinion. Rose plays Renai, who was the main witness to the majority of paranormal activity going on in her home. Speaking of paranormal activity, this film borrows some aspects from that successful franchise. The overt sounds of footsteps, the moving of personal items around the house and other things of that nature. Yet, where Paranormal Activity attempted to add an ingredient of reality by keeping the specter invisible, Insidious was more than willing to physically illustrate the ghost, or ghosts in this feature.

 The same goes for another aspect, which was stolen from another successful movie Poltergeist. Remember Carol Ann who was sucked into the television set and was escorted off by dead Indians to another dimension where they were going to have their way with her? They never shown what that dimension was like  but here inside of Insidious, they explained that Dalton has mistaken this spiritual realm for one of his dreams. This gave them the license to paint the picture of what this eerie place can look like, and they do. While I would imagine that this would cheapen the scares by adding too much fantasy that the authenticity of the story would be compromised, it actually worked very well. Other films it borrows from include The Omen, Blair Witch Project and of course Star Wars: Phantom Menace (inside joke).

 The movie has a veil of mystery that isn't drawn back until its very end. Because of this, I could never predict what was going to happen next, and I tried. Even the #1 rule in films like this (written by The Exorcist), when there is a very quiet moment that when you can get prepared to get scared out of your skin as you see and hear a demon with its demonic soundtrack popping up to squelch the quiet with a screen full of horror. Patrick Wilson plays Josh, the father and husband of the Lambert Family. It was very easy to hate his character Josh as he was in perpetual disbelief while he stayed out all night trying to avoid the haunted drama unfolding at home.

 The houses themselves were very spooky, even when they had to move they choose to set up the new home with a creepy vibe. I mean anyone who places an old grandfather clock at the end of a dark hallway is just asking to get spooked. Anyway, I really liked the movie, despite the strange ending which Im still not sure what it all really means. There were enough scares and images that will make you jump out of your seat to keep every horror movie fan satisfied. I give this movie 4 stars, hopefully it won't be ruined with flimsy sequels.

4406666,4,B004LWZW2E,"This is a pretty decent horror film. Unlike other Horror films where your cast feels limited to teenagers or people who can only afford shoty cameras for found footage films. This has a broader appeal. There's a family at stake versus maybe one teenager you don't hate, or any other poorly crafted stock characters we're used to seeing in horror films. I like that aspect of it. I enjoy how high the film makes stakes feel, and how concerned I am for this family, not just during the more horrific elements, but just the everday life of living with a child with serious medical problems. There are some excellent scares, a thought out story, and the actors really put you into believing that this is happening to them. The characters themselves are likable people too. Perfect, no, but average and likable enough. Overall you hope they win, rather than sit back and take bets on who dies first. There are of course some problems with the film. It suffers from a bizarre pacing, and just as strange editing. While I've seen worse, during shots of the house, the transitions feel a little too rushed or disjointed for my mind to properly adjust. Maybe that's intentional? Done with a little more subtly ( or less even)  it could be off putting, but as is it's just more irritating than mood setting. I also feel the need to point out that the sequence before the opening credits while neat in hindsight, offer nothing to a new audience other than a false start and added confusion as to what's taking place in the film. The opening credits feel a bit cheesy as well. While shots or still in black in white of things moving, or ghost faces in clocks and other places, it feels like a very boring art project, which again takes away from the atmosphere the film is trying to create. There's also some moments where the CGI effects come off as a bit cheap or lazy, but I have to applaud where they skated around having to use much of it to begin with. Most of the effects seem to be done practically, with some stop motion type feel at points. The demon in the film can be taken as either a bit silly, or very scary depending on who you are. I think it's being kept mostly obscure was a strong point, and it's design does have some very nice touches that give it just enough to keep it frightening. Some after seeing it however will instantly dissect the CGI areas and the facial paint and tend to laugh rather than be afraid. Either way, it's a villain that would probably scare you in the family's shoes.
Ultimately, if you're looking for a decent horror flick, this is a good one. as a series, its trying something a bit different from most horror films, and mostly succeeds. And if we're going for a moral here, I think two are prevalent: Don't delve too far into the unknown, and don't take pictures to confirm your suspicions when you're a psychic person who probably doesn't need a photo for proof of what she's seeing unless it's to show to someone else, in which case there are far more subtle ways of getting that proof. But hey, we gotta keep the suspense going, right?",1477353600,,3075,4.47153024911032

4407157,2,B004LWZW2E,"This film had been hyped up to me by a few friends who touted it as particularly good and scary.

I was, regrettably, able to guess what was happening as it happened for nearly the entire film. To be fair, I'm a filmmaker and horror aficionado, so maybe I just have an eye for guessing these things, but the ham-fisted ""this is important"" way they linger on clues and omens seemed way overdone to me. Took the potential scariness right out of there.

The production quality was mostly solid, with only one extra-campy CG effect that took me out of the film.
For my part, I felt there were two legitimately creepy moments without the minute of obvious lead-in prepping you to know something scary is about to happen. They were never addressed again, and I think they were wasted on this film.

Although this film is intended to be scary, it's probably best for an audience that prefers dramas, instead of horror films. If you have little or no history of watching horror films, perhaps the scares will get you. If you're an avid horror fan, you've seen it all before.",1466553600,,1066,4.541666666666667

4407160,2,B004LWZW2E,"Aside from the saw and hostel movies, (all those garbage gore movies) this is pretty bottom shelf horror to be honest. It's more of an atmospheric ghost story, and there are a few effective moments in the beginning, but by the end it's just not scary. It's very PG-13, there's many scares that fall flat, and also with this jump scare craze it's really too much of a bad thing. Horror movies aren't easy to make but towards the middle of this it goes downhill fast and the movie uses all these random ghosts and demons that simply aren't scary. It all starts to feel very low budget and cheap.

 Add in a nonsensical plot and there's not much to recommend here. You can clearly see where the movie gets things wrong when it comes to the actual horror aspects. The Conjuring is better than this, although that had a few silly moments too, but it was more focused and scary than this. James Wan seems to have a problem with letting cheese and silliness enter into his horror movies. A horror movie should never make me laugh or cringe at the moments that are supposed to be scary. And the jump scares are cheap, horror is about atmosphere and fear, not being surprised by a jump scare.

There are plenty of neat ideas here, but a lot or recycled stuff, too. If your expectations for modern horror films were significantly raised by The Conjuring, you'll probably find Insidious to be a pretty serious step backwards. This movie is clumsy, clunky, suffers from a very disjointed plot, the acting is sub par (even for the two leads, but it wasn't their fault, as the script was pretty terrible) and the story is very forced. In a word, contrived. And I really had high hopes for this one. Oh well. Many won't agree, more power to them.

4407332,5,B004LWZW2E,"I feel like a movie doesn't have to be perfect to deserve a 5 star rating. The thing I found wrong with the movie is that in the 2nd half the story felt a little bit forced with Josh being a traveler too and other related parts. There was also a goofy scene or two. What made it 5 stars for me was the fact that it was scary throughout. It had a balanced, high-volume blend of jump scares and atmospheric tension causing fear. For me it also has had the highest staying power of any scary movie I've ever seen. After seeing it around a dozen times I still jump and get scared. In most cases, if a movie even scares me the first time it probably won't the 2nd or 3rd time. The best part about this is that I don't feel that a horror movie has to be scary to be absolutely amazing. So the extra credit more than makes up for some wrinkles in execution of the filmmaking . Also a demonic possession film not centered entirely on Abrahamic religion in one way or another isn't easy to find, especially one this caliber.",1460505600,,1015,4.157360406091371

If you like a very realistic thriller/horror type of movie to be somewhat believable like I do then this one you can skip IMHO.  There is no fun in a movie that looks like it was scripted by a bunch of elementary school kids.  I couldn't even finish it.  I turned it off with 10 minutes left.  Yeah, it was that bad at the end.",1451952000,,452,4.056818181818182
4407494,3,B004LWZW2E,"The beginning of the movie was genuinely creepy as well as unsettling.

It had me entranced and grabbed me from the start.

However what really ruined this movie for me completely was near the ending which I won't ruin for those who haven't seen this movie.

Suffice it to say to me it was no longer scary or creepy it was just embarrassing, unscary, and flat out stupid.

They really dropped the ball when it came to that other place in the film because it was just lame looking not the least bit scary or suspenseful period.

So I give the beginning a big thumbs up it had an interesting story, genuinely creepy and tense parts, and it felt like it made sense.

The middle and near the end however just destroyed the rest of the film for me .

I love Lin Shaye also I've seen her in so many movies especially horror movies and she made sense but the ending just ...sucked and made me look at the rest of the movie I had just watched as being flat out stupid and pointless.

I have been putting off seeing this one for about 3 years, after my husband attempted to watch it in the middle of the day...in 20 minute increments...and still couldn't finish it. And I was right to! By far and away, the scariest movie I have ever seen. It's got me looking over my shoulder in the middle of the day! It isn't a horror film where the ""jump"" scenes are predicted by ominous music. It gives no warning before it scares the hell out of you. And toward the end, the scary moments don't let you catch your breath and recover from the last scary moment. The just keep coming at you. It was awesome!
P.S. I saw Insidious 2 before this one, and I am so glad that I did. It explained a lot!",1442275200,,829,4.060975609756097

4408446,5,B004LWZW2E,"One of the best horror films I've ever seen. I'm not into gore. I like the subtle, eerie kind of horror film. To me, Phantasm captured that dread perfectly, or nearly so. I've found moments in Halloween to be exquisitely unnerving (e.g., the scene where Jamie gets out of the shower, looks out the window, and there, downstairs in her yard, between the hanging clothes, is Michael Myers staring at her--how would he know when and where to look? Perfection!).

Insidious comes close to this kind of strange, unnerving atmosphere. The cover picture, with the demonic-looking child colored red and staring at the viewer, is misleading. There is much more subtlety about this movies horror.",1441584000,,686,4.965217391304348

I was afraid to get out of bed the next morning for fear one of the creepies was going to be at the end of my hallway waiting for me.

4410236,2,B004LWZW2E,"Story:
This isn't the typical ghost story about a family moving into a haunted house.  It is original in the astral projection area, but everything else is extremely foreseeable.

Cast:
The actors absolutely had no chemistry.  Every conversation in the movie felt forced and awkward.

Production:
Although some (just a couple) scenes had great composition, the majority of the movie felt like I was watching a B-movie made for the SyFy channel.  Jump cuts were way too overused and left you randomly on the story's timeline.  Don't even get me started on the cheap jump scare attempts (read: loud obnoxious noises).  At no point during this movie did I flinch, look away or feel scared.  I felt like turning it off multiple times throughout but decided I might as well make the most of the rental cost and finish it.

Score/Sound:
Dreadful.  The music did nothing to entice a feeling similar to what the movie wanted and many times it was just loud, obnoxious string noises.

In Summary:
I had high hopes for this movie, but it tanked.  Bad.  Don't waste your money on this unless you and a group of friends have nothing to do but get wasted and have a need to occupy time.",1429401600,,1173,4.635922330097087

4410298,5,B004LWZW2E,This is one of my favorite scary movies because it is actually scary! I was raised watching horror films and this actually has a great plot with suspense and thrills.

4410299,4,B004LWZW2E,"I saw this movie a few years ago when it was initially released on DVD. I have seen it a couple of times since then, and I can admit that the red demon still freaks me out. Often, I find that directors enjoy dropping hints about the plot, and this was evident with the boy's drawings and his father's photographs as a child. When I watch a movie I do not sit there throughout the entire movie trying to figure out the plot, especially for a horror movie.  I've read quite a few of the one star reviews on Amazon for this movie and most of them have no validity to them at all. If you're going to write a review, I find that it helps to be able to spell properly and provide adequate grammar.",1428969600,,691,4.080882352941177

It is the story of this family that move into this house and some weird crap starts happening.  Yeah, just like every other horror movie, I get it.  Demons, weird things moving, the voices of small children running through the house and objects disappearing and reappearing later all occur.  The family moves, but the strange occurrences follow.  They bring in some old lady with a weird voice who has super powers to help.  After that, it all goes downhill.  And not in a good way.

The movie is definitely worth watching and has some scary scenes that made me have to change my shorts a few times.  Watch it if you are bored and there is nothing else on TV.  You will laugh, cry, tremble, cry and laugh again.",1416441600,,844,4.387096774193548

I can usually see through scare moments as many movies will have hints to when a popout scare is going to happen (i.e. music change, silence, camera moving slowly behind or in front of character to limit POV).  Equally as bad are that most horror movies try to shock you with gratuitous amounts of gore.  Insidious is a refreshing horror story that combines the supernatural with some uniquely scary parts.  A lot of the scary moments are not anticipated and there is a lot of build up, up until the end.

Good scares, good mythology, solid creepy vibe, doesn't rely on cheap scares.  The seance scene is pretty much where the movie craps out.  It starts out pretty creepy and builds to a good scare, but then that scene ends kind of stupidly.  It would be forgivable if the last 10 minutes of the movie wasn't so incredibly stupid.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm a firm believer that ghosts do a lot of weird stuff, but one thing they don't do is fight people in comical fashion.  The villain is scary as hell until you get a good look at him and then it's all laughs.

Insidious is not necessarily a jumpy movie where scary images pop out out of nowhere (though there are a couple spots that this does happen) but it tends to build with suspense through the actions and music.

The gore was minimal to non-existant.  And the way the simplicity of the whole story was aand the way they cleaverly set it up was really nice.  I actually get creeped out whenever I watch it.  And I will never think of Tiny Tim the same way EVER again!

4411778,4,B004LWZW2E,"Make no mistake. Most of these haunted house movies are just remakes of the original Amityville and/or The Exorcist. The Conjuring did it very well. The actual Amityville remake didn't. Poltergeist was brilliant at it. And Insidious? It does it VERY well.

Insidious accomplishes this by changing things up a bit. Without going into spoiler territory, the antagonist in Insidious is not just a noisy ghost, though it does make its share of noise. While in Poltergeist the child was snatched away through the TV, body and all, the child in Insidious is instead taken in mind only. This adds a layer of horror as the parents of the lost child must watch over his body, fearing that something is coming for it.

Rise Byrne is especially effective in this movie. The child manages to be childlike without being sickeningly precocious. The people who come to help-- as there are in every movie of this kind-- are entertainingly quirky and interesting.

All I can say is that it's a good movie if you're a fan of good ghost stories. Really, just watch it.",1393200000,,1049,4.721311475409836

4411780,5,B004LWZW2E,"I love horror movies.  I don't really enjoy the gore, Hostel, type movies.  I prefer the movies that really work to scare.  And this one does.  One of the most interesting things about this movie is that it moves back to be basics.  The music score and even the plot refer back to the old movies.  Initially this came off as cheesy and well no one likes watching the same movie just updated every few decades.  But this movie takes those basic elements that had been understood years ago and perfects them.  I'm a grown man in my thirties.  After so many years of watching every horror movies it's impossible for a movie to freak me out.  Until Insidious.  In fact my girlfriend wasn't happy going to bed alone.
I'm not going to talk much about the plot, because that is the best part of the movie, and you deserve to have it unfold for you as you watch.  I will say it was well thought out, and the pacing was perfect.  The acting was great, and I enjoyed each of the characters.  We will watch the second movie tomorrow and I hope it is just as good.

4411936,3,B004LWZW2E,"So the guy from ""The Conjuring"" finally gets sick of collecting haunted objects and starts a new life with an emaciated young woman, who I thought was eaten by zombies in ""28 Weeks Later."" Their son falls into a ""coma"" and the very skinny and frail wife of his starts hearing things in the house, and seeing people wander about preparing to do untold wicked things. They react well, by moving to a different house. But, alas, the house wasn't the problem. Their son was the one that is haunted. Dun DUN DUN!!!

I felt that the acting was poor, but the story was pretty good. I've never acted before, so I don't know. Maybe they all won academy awards for this film. There's a scene at the beginning where our young leading lady comes down the stairs wearing her footy pajamas. It took me a minute to figure out she was the wife, and not the teenage daughter. Grow up and buy some slippers. She also somehow carries her baby around. Looking at her arms reminded me of prisoners from Buchenwald or Auschwitz. She gives her son a feeding tube, but I hope she took a couple hits off of it first.

Our fearless dad, does an absolutely terrible job of reacting to a possible intruder in his house. He wanders around like he's looking for his car keys, and seems relatively unconcerned that his front door keeps opening itself. He does a little better later in the film, and I'm sure his career is safe. As I was washing windows with a dirty newspaper near the on ramp I thought, good for him. He's making money doing what he loves, just like me.

These acting (and dieting) flaws aside, the film is pretty good. It gives you those creepy goose bumps from time to time that are what keep us watching these kinds of films. If you've got nothing better to do, rent this movie. I should have been doing my taxes. I, therefore, do hereby bestow three stars upon this film. I'm probably gonna watch the second one, because I don't want to do my taxes.",1391644800,,1939,4.395543175487465
4411937,5,B004LWZW2E,"The horror genre has a lot of paranormal type movies out right now. The movie Insidious takes a twist on the old haunted house stories and turns them on their ear. Instead of an old house that was once the sight of a grizzly horrifying series of occurrencs....it's the innocent young child that becomes haunted! It seems as if ""I see Ghosts"" is a family trait that can be handed down.  At first they don't understand that the boy has been literally frightened into an unresponsive state. But after the child falls deep into a comma that has no discernable cause, and no signs of awakening, the parents find out that the father was once plagued by this rare insight into the ""Further"" a place where the evil dead are stranded in limbo...forever, reliving their nightmarish deeds over and over in the darkness of the purgatory type place.
  The child is there.
  And he's stranded. And there are some really, really, nasty stuff in there with him.
  The only way to save the child is for the father to go in after his son. But first he has to have his childhood memories restored of His own battle with the dark legions. With  the help of a psychic team, (right out of poltergiest) they commence a battle that carries over into Insidious 2.
  My advice, rent them both together and watch them in sequence. Awesome flick! Together, it's the makings of a story that is truly frightening; a couple of nights of real nightmares for the viewer.",1391644800,3,1437,4.556420233463035

Everything about James Wan's ""The Conjuring"" was excellent....the direction, the musical score, the sound effects and the acting made it a 5-star, spine chilling, edge of your seat production.  This was none of that.  I felt like I was on a cheesy ""House of Horrors"" carnival ride, mostly in the dark, with lots of smoke, overly loud clanging noises and things that jump out at you.  This was so bad, it was funny....particularly the part where the medium straps on a gas mask and talks into a plastic tube connected to headphones worn by her assistant who is frantically repeating and writing what she says.  Gimme a break!  And who is the old lady with the candle? ....you never find out....like so many things in this movie that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.

4412715,2,B004LWZW2E,"IMHO an okay movie, which my wife and I really didn't like. It was imaginative to a degree and a little scary. However it was disappointing in that the acting/directing/screenwriting was not good. Where do I begin? First this was not based on any kind of real story or events (not that that is essential to a good film but it might have lent more depth and reality to a poor script), which to me would have made it more interesting. Second, some of the actors (the high tech paranormal investigators and their psychic colleague ) act as though this is routine which doesn't seem to be realistic. Do they go through this every week? And,  after all, many real people would have had many troubles after witnessing such events most especially fear and terror, stress and possible psychological problems. But even more objectionable is this psychic who seems to know it all. I have studied real life possessions in Malachi Martin's(former Jesuit exorcist at the Vatican) book Hostage to the Devil . This movie seems to be completely ignorant of demonic possession and exorcism. One priest makes one entrance in the story and then is shown the door. Then the battle against the demons takes place with high tech and a ""great"" psychic. Not once is the word 'God' mentioned. All real exorcisms have priests, rabbis, ministers casting demons out in the name of God/Jesus. Here we have confident , arrogant people with no clue battling against Demons/Satan. Religion is never really mentioned. There seems to be a strong tendency to avoid any mention of spirituality, faith, prayer, religion in the battle against evil. Seems ridiculous that the traditional weapons against evil have been expunged and replaced with pride and ego. It is really sad in our modern secular society to see how bigoted film makers are in being close minded to spirituality and religion. These film makers should have studied the classic movie ""The Exorcist"" and/or done some research into real life accounts. Sometimes the reality is much scarier.",1386288000,,2016,4.912023460410557

4412774,5,B004LWZW2E,"Insidious means to proceed in a gradual, subtle way but with very harmful effects. It is very tricky to make a horror film because part of being a man is to never admit you are scared and all that false bravado. This is why men giggle at the movies. Anyway..

Insidious is a compelling horror with a most unique storyline. Why? Not only is the plot projection stunning but there is an overwhelming voice of reason in the protagonist. You can tell a good horror film from a bad horror film when the film is three steps ahead of your voice of reason. On that level, it certainly engages, charms, surprises you with the ideas it conjures and more. But its not just a horror film, it is so tastefully done that I doubt I have seen anything in my life that has stunned me as much. The Conjuring comes to mind but this is to Conjuring what Pulp Fiction is to Death Proof or what Departed is to Goodfellas - James Wan, I predict will rewrite how horror is done. They take all the anguish of a horrible dream, spill it here and there and leave you gutted. This has two most beautifully shot horror scenes.

That said, I can say without any doubt this is the newest entrant to my all time top 100 list. I don't know quite where but it most definitely is.

PS - I just finished watching this. I didn't know what hit me or if I was in a coma. I couldn't move, the hair on my body were dutifully singing their own national anthem. That's it, Im done.",1385164800,,1438,4.202898550724638

4412928,3,B004LWZW2E,"First, I'm so glad I waited until I could stream this via a rental rather than a permanent purchase.  ""Insidious"" is definitely scary/creepy/unsettling from the very first shots; despite this, something was bugging me about the movie.  About 45 minutes in I realized what it was: there is no story.  The creepiness has nothing to do with the narrative, but rather the camera work and scoring -- this is quite common these days.  However this particular movie is presented as if there is going to be a meaningful narrative.  A musician mother and teacher father and their three young children move into a house paneled with lots of dark oak .  It is said that ""things are going to be better"" now that they've moved, hinting at previous problems. These problems are perhaps connected to the mother's unhappiness; she is very grateful that her husband is allowing her to focus on her music full-time now.  Still, it's apparent that she doesn't feel he's really helpful enough.  Has there been marital strife?

After a few nights in the house, the oldest son is in a coma that confounds medical experts and the house is full of unexplained disturbances.  After about three months, the mother is insistant upon moving.  Her chronically detached husband agrees so they do, and find themselves still ""haunted"" by whatever it was that was tormenting them in the first house.  It isn't until the family moves into this second home that there is any glimpse of a tangible story.  Unfortunately for ""Insidious,"" that story is ""Poltergeist"" -- without the depth.

The only element that is introduced in the beginning of ""Insidious"" that is carried through is the fact that the father doesn't like to have his picture taken.  What previous problems did the family have?  Who knows.  Instead, the paternal grandmother is introduced and we enter what seems like a whole different movie.  All that was frightening about it to begin with is lost as it unravels into ridiculousness.  And it can't be said enough how derivative the story is of ""Poltergeist.""  ""Poltergeist"" isn't necessarily scary, but it has that thing about it that elevates a mediocre horror movie to the realm of the iconic: a point.  At its center, ""Poltergeist"" is about the hippie generation grappling with the ""greed is good"" mentality of the 1980's -- a commentary on capitalism, traditional values, etc.  There is no such subtext in ""Insidious.""

To give an example of how little ""Insidious"" focuses on a script or story continuity, the grandmother is supposed to be watching the other 2 kids while a supernatural rescue team tries to save the boy in a coma (i.e., bring his soul back to his physical being).  There is no mention of her having a husband, of there being a grandfather.  In fact, despite the family's earlier problems, despite this woman's grandson needing round the clock medical care, we don't see this character the entire first half of the movie.  Yet when they call her to the house she runs right over in a matter of minutes so she's clearly nearby -- unless the father got a new teaching gig and they up and moved across the country.  And now that the grandmother is participating in the festivities, the other kids are with whom?  But she needs to be there because any substantive story the movie has is based on the grandmother's dialogue; about 80 minutes in, she (with the aid of the leader of the supernatural rescue team) explains to the audience what the reason for all the ghosts, demons, and creepiness is. That's how exciting it is -- straight-up exposition.

At this point, the movie is not scary.  It is silly.  Rose Byrne (mother), Patrick Wilson (father), Barbara Hershey (grandmother), et al can't be faulted for empty performances since they had so little with which to work.  Suddenly, the sick boy's freaky drawings which have been on his wall for months and are freaky regardless of what has subsequently been revealed have meaning!  We never find out why the family moved into the first new house to begin with.  If there were problems in their previous home, it can only be assumed, but then why would the mother feel moving a third time would make it any better?  And although the ending is supposed to represent a twist, I figured it out, as I think many people would given that these movies always end with a twist and there aren't many directions in which to go here.

So, ""Insidious"" is scary in the beginning, but in the same way walking through a haunted house is scary because you are literally following the camera turning the set into a haunted house. A dark realm is explored toward the end, but by that point I personally couldn't stop comparing the ways in which the movie was like -- and not as good as -- ""Poltergeist.""  The movie stops being engaging just at the point it's really supposed to get intense.  Bottom line: it really needed more of an original story, and that story really needed to be integral to more of the movie, not just the second half of it.",1382140800,,4978,4.71875

4413032,2,B004LWZW2E,"My girlfriend and I rented this movie because we wanted to see something scary, and for the first half, it was well on its way to becoming a very creepy and frightening movie.

Unfortunately, like most horror movies. Once you hit the second half of the movie, it all starts going downhill from there. The make up for the main ""ghost"" was absolutely terrible and didn't illicit any fear. In fact, it was so bad, that you couldn't help but roll your eyes as to how bad the creature design was. The scary ghost old woman had the best make up of the bunch and was the scariest of them all, but she only shows up in a few scenes.

Essentially, this movie is not as scary as one might hope. Its best moment was when the ghost was walking outside the house on the second floor and then suddenly it appeared inside the house and attacked the woman. THAT was scary, but is unfortunately, the ONLY scary part of this movie.

This movie really could have knocked it out of the park. The editing, the shots, the atmosphere, everything was extremely well executed and definitely copied some of the scariest movies of our time. But once the second half with the psychic rolls around, it all goes down hill from there and makes you wonder, just what the hell happened? It's almost as if a different director or writer took over and threw the movie into the garbage. The second half of the movie is an absolute waste, and ruins what could have been an incredible, scary movie.

A new twist is added in this movie, astral projection, being able to move outside your body. I find it fitting that Barbara Hersey is in this movie. She starred in one of the best horror movies I've seen, The Entity. This has to be one of the top 5 haunted house/possession movies made. Highly recommend.",1381881600,,428,4.283950617283951

4413220,5,B004LWZW2E,Was actually a pretty good movie. Story line was easy to follow..  Very good for a scary movie.  Had to go watch the second one.,1380758400,,128,4.08
4413461,3,B004LWZW2E,"After reading some other reviews, I have to agree that this is very nearly a ""Poltergeist"" remake.  There are some variations (ie, being trapped via astral projection as opposed to being snatched by ghosts), but it is quite similar.

One reviewer indicated he almost peed his pants watching this film.  Thankfully, that didn't happen to me (*grin*), although I will admit to some goose flesh at a couple of spots when the special effects were particularly creepy.  The film begins very slowly and then finally picks up the pace.  Once things got going, it was entertaining.  The main reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the very slow beginning and the ending.  I generally dislike movies that end without a happy resolution and without the bad guys getting their comeuppance.  In fact, I seriously hate that.  This movie has a similar type of ending, which I found very annoying.  I know it's pat, but I just prefer the tidy resolution where everything is right with the world again.

***Potential Spoiler Alert***
I also found myself really detesting the father in the movie, as he seemed like a complete idiot.  I mean, why go to all of the trouble to astrally project himself and fist-fight a ghost (seriously?) in order to find his lost son, only to stupidly separate from said son and squander valuable time feebly screaming at a ghost in the mirror??  And before astrally projecting, the dad was resoundingly warned NOT to draw attention to himself.  Yet, the second he reaches The Further, he meanders all over the place stupidly and repeatedly yelling ""HELLO?!"" as loudly as possible.  That's about as subtle as driving your car on the sidewalk.  So by the end of the movie, I was ready to thrash the father myself.

Anyway, this isn't a terrible film or the stupidest movie I've ever seen, as some reviewers have stated.  It's entertaining for a one-time viewing, but probably isn't something I'll ever watch again.

PARENT ALERT: As for the rating (PG-13), it does have some pretty scary moments that I wouldn't want my kids to watch, as well as some swearing--most notably one F-bomb, along with several religious exclamations.",1380585600,,2141,4.816438356164384

4413535,4,B004LWZW2E,"This movie starts out fairly mundane. Kid, family, new home. I couldn't help but think that this was going to be another Poltergeist or Paranormal activity. I half expected to have a jump scare within the first few minutes. Nope, didn't happen.

However, the opening was more about you identifying with the characters and getting to know them better. I was really rather bored about 15-20 minutes into it. There's quite a bit of foreshadowing in the beginning, however.

Then things start getting creepy. Typical poltergeist happenings, followed by several other scaries and a whole lot of creepy. Some awkward long dialogue scenes later in the movie with extreme close-ups on the actors faces really killed the mood. Still, the creepy factor really added up and startled everyone who was watching it with me, including myself. A for effort.",1379203200,3,841,5.043165467625899

4414176,5,B004LWZW2E,"Insidious is brilliant. I have watched numerous horror films and I have to say that it is the best and scariest horror film I have ever seen. It is truly a classic. As a young adult, I guess I do not get scared anymore when watching horror films, but it wasn't until I saw Insidious that I had nightmares and kept pondering about it.

The things that make this film sincerely scary are the cinematography, sound effects, and storyline. The suspense was killing me throughout the entire film and the twists were unexpected. The story is pretty sad too. Many horror films now-a-days have too much CGI, soft porn, and are just plain predictable, but this one had none of that. Insidious focuses heavily on the ""what ifs"" of a subject that really does exists and there are scenes where I was thinking ""What is that?"" All films now-a-days are not very original, but this one stands out from many horror movies.

I am in the minority when it comes to thinking that The Exorcist, known as the scariest film in Hollywood, was not scary at all. I found it quite boring. It was disturbing and the acting was excellent, but I was not scared one bit.

It is funny because the trailer does not do Insidious justice. It is enough to interest one in watching the film, but I did not expect it to be this scary and I believe the trailer was meant to do that. It is unfortunate when a trailer is better than the actual film or has basically shown all of what happens in the movie.",1374969600,,1463,4.391143911439114

Don't let the message on the dvd box ""From the directors of paranormal activity"" fool you as paranormal activity was not scary at all and is nothing like Insidious. Insidious isn't no teenager/young adult slasher film, it's true horror film with realistic normal people. The movie is straight up weird in a creepy way.

The spirits/figures appear in the weirdest parts in rooms at the least expected time in the movie. Some things can be seen in the background where most of the audience won't see until they watch it for the second time. Good/different storyline along the way. It isn't a typical ghost movie, it is something deeper than that.

What helps this movie become creepier is the music. It has a feel of a old school horror film. Good horror flick.",1373414400,4,855,4.6490066225165565

Once you find out the source of the hauntings, and how they go about fixing it, it gets a little out there for me.

I've spoken to many people who didn't think this movie was scary at all.  Maybe it depends on your state of mind when you see it.  I saw it in the theater and I was completely creeped out.  The atmosphere, sound, and imagery (produced with a minimal budget) in the film cut me to the core.  It's some spooky stuff!  Many also saw the film as a rehash of Poltergeist.  I can see the parallels, but I didn't notice them when I first saw the film and, anyway, I still think Insidious stands on its own.

From the writer and director of Saw, comes another horror film, this time in the form of a ghostly thriller. The film starts out quite slow and drawn out, but one feels it is all by design as by the time the inhabited demons drop by for a scare, you will be well and truly clutching your cushion in terror. Unfortunately, this is the film's blessing and curse, in that after a while you begin to get acclimatised to the constant `jump' moments, Director James Wan throws at you. So, by the time the film reaches it climatic end and we finally get to see the demon that lurks, it is neither scary, nor memorable. The actors do fine jobs and the dark lighting and cinematography fleshes out a creepy atmosphere. That being said, for a night of screams on a Saturday night be sure to rent it out...but it's unlikely you'll ever watch it again.

I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes psychological horror and the movie did pretty good at achieving that, and without copious amounts of blood and gore (virtually none, in fact), somewhat rare for horror films these days. The appearance of Lin Shaye - the 'Teacher' in the original A Nightmare on Elm Street - should be a familiar one for horror fans in general.

Wow, what can I say about this movie?! When I saw it in theaters last year, I was blown away. It was EXCELLENT, and I don't say that lightly. A throwback to the great, supernatural horror films like Amityville, Poltergeist, The Exorcist, The Entity, Rosemary's Baby, and The Shining, ""Insidious"" is a truly fascinating and scary film! In fact, it instantly and easily became one of my favorite horror films from the first time I saw it. If you're looking for proof that recent horror films aren't all bad, I've got three masterpieces for you, and this is one of them. The other two are ""Cabin in the Woods"" and ""The Mist"", but I digress.

A fine cast (including ""The Entity"" star Barbara Hershey) , some plot qualities we've never seen before, and some truly scary music and imagery make this film a cut above the rest, and I highly recommend it. Don't listen to nay-sayers who  describe the ending as too open or the film's demon as too Darth Maul-esque. There is nothing but win here. The demon is freaky and the Tip Toe Through the Tulips scene, ugh! Try getting that song and its creepiness out of your head after seeing this for the first time! I only hope the upcoming ""Sinister"" is this good!

Now, the Blu-Ray bonus features are a bit underwhelming. There are 3 behind the scenes featurettes, that's pretty much it. They are good, but this film deserved so much more.

4414678,4,B004LWZW2E,"Insidious is an independent horror film from director James Wan; one of my personal favorite directors who also directed Saw and Death Sentence. Insidious is slightly different from other haunted house films because it's not the house that's haunted. It's not a big change to the genre, but at least it attempts to create something different. Insidious mixes tension with jump-out scares. When I originally watched it in theaters (with mixed expectations because of the Paranormal Activity marketing and James Wan directing), most of the scares were original and unexpected so I left satisfied. The first two acts of the film are terrifying and amazing. I have mixed feelings about the last act when they enter what is called ""The Further"". Although it changes the pace of the film and isn't as scary as the first half, it's still manages to be creepy. Consequently, I enjoyed the film overall. The acting was fine, the music was great, and the scares were often original and creative.

By the way, the bluray cover for this movie depicting a child and a house on the background is misleading. I thought it would be something like ""The Orphan"" or ""The Omen"" where there is an evil kid who does a lot of evil things. Here is not that way at all.

4414684,5,B004LWZW2E,"A film like ""Insidious"" makes it look easier than it is for most filmmakers.  It's, at its core, an old-school ghost story done with such modern flair . . .from everything to writing, acting, casting, score, cinematography, sound, and special effects, that it leaves me to wonder why more filmmakers can't make horror films this superbly.  I am a jaded horror fan.  Horror fans are like drug addicts...we keep chasing the cherry high.  ""Insidious"" by description sounds like a story we have seen a thousand times.  Young couple buys first house, nice kids, lots of high hopes for the future, all of which is wrecked by a pesky haunting.  ""Insidious"" takes these tired ingredients and gives them more than a facelift...it has set a new bar for this sub-genre.  Patrick Wilson (Little Children, Hard Candy) and the lovely Rose Byrne (TV's ""Damages"", ""Get Him to the Greek"", ""Knowing"") star as the young, idealistic couple, Josh and Raneigh, who find themselves plunged into a nightmare when they come to believe their house is haunted and means them harm as their 7 year old son ends up in an unexplained coma after a ghost encounter. Josh's mother (played by the aging ever gracefully Barbara Hershey) brings in a psychic to investigate (another cliche), but what again, sets this apart is the panache brought to the character by Lin Shaye, a terrific character and stage actress.  She believes Dalton (the little boy) is a gifted astral-projector who has ventured too far away from his body.  I won't explain more so as not to spoil the twists, but the ensuing action is as terrifying as movies get.  Director James Wan, who cut his teeth on the original ""Saw"", infuses the films with energy, tension and unbearable suspense.  My heart was pounding through most of the film.  Did I mention there is a rather terrifying demon lurking about the house?

""Insidious"" was made on a shoestring budget of only $1 million.  You would never know it in looking at the value per dollar on the screen.  First-rate actors, superb art direction and special effects, it looks like a $40 million film.  This gave Wan tremendous freedom to make the movie he wanted to make and the results are truly unnerving.  The movie has an uncommon intelligence...this is a couple that actually talks to each other and believes each other, where lesser movies hang the plot on this communication not happening.  I especially liked the fact that after a few incidents at their first home, they move.  This usually harkens the end of the film.  Instead, to the sickening realization of our characters and we the audience, the ghosts follow them, as it is not the house which is haunted, but the boy.  The characters make logical decisions making them easy to indetify with and enormously likable.  It helps to have actors of Wilson and Byrne's caliber.  I was riveted to this film, and if you're a fan of ghost stories, especially those which rely on atmosphere, story and suspense over blood and guts, you will be richly rewarded and long haunted even after the credits roll.  This is superior film, well worth purchasing.  I recommend the Bluray version strongly to see the nuanced details in the art direction and the perfect replication of the original photography.  Extras are light, which is disappointing, but the film more than makes up for it.

4414686,4,B004LWZW2E,"It takes a lot to scare me. I've got roughly three decades of horror movie watching and fandom accrued, and few movies from the horror genre genuinely impress me - especially nowadays, where crass film studios forego any semblance of quality in favor of cranking out endless lame sequels, and complicit audiences reinforce studio behavior by continuing to shell out box-office ducats for cinematic offal. Insidious is one of the few recent horror entries to actually provide genuine scares. There are several elements I can point to which explain why next.

Firstly, this film focuses on the element of dread. So few horror movies today generate any real dread, and instead use cheap cat-jumping-suddenly-into-frame scares, overly elaborate death scenes, and/or look-how-psycho-I-am killers to mask the fact that they don't really offer anything truly scary. Examples of this in the horror genre are legion, such as any film directed by Rob Zombie (I mean seriously, is anyone really scared by dirty, profane trailer park rejects or long haired blonde kids wearing rock tees?). Even the people that made Insidious are guilty of some of this (read: the Saw films). But in the case of Insidious, the filmmakers put most of the cheap techniques aside and instead utilize excellent atmosphere, decent pacing, competent editing, and thoughtful scoring - all of which combine to really drop the psychological hammer on the viewer.

Secondly, the family being tormented in the film is sympathetic. Though the characterizations of them aren't overly deep, the important thing is that the family isn't an object of audience irritation. This is such a basic rule in making an effective horror flick, and yet it is constantly ignored by the hacks that put out most ""horror"" films. Most times I want to punch horror film characters for being abjectly irritating or stupid; so it's only gleeful schadenfreude on my part, and not fear, when they meet their inevitable end. This film produces real apprehension simply by generating a basic level of empathy for the family.

Finally, the film utilizes top notch camera work and shot framing. This is SUCH an important aspect in terms of inducing fear in the audience, but most horror films don't even bother (or their directors just simply don't have a decent feel for how the framing and position of their camera can completely add or subtract to the audience's level of psychological torment.) There are quite a few moments in Insidious where the director uses his knowledge of the audience's knowledge of overly used horror film camera techniques to mess with them and to manipulate their expectations - which of course works brilliantly to throw the viewer off kilter and generate real foreboding.

To wrap up, quite a few of the negative reviews I've read here are plainly misguided. Some argue points that have weight, but to say that the film needed more special effects or that it didn't have any scares just underscores the fact that many horror movie audience members clearly don't appreciate horror flicks that aren't garish or that forego theme park bells and cheap (or not so cheap) thrills. Yes, I'll grant that the first half of the movie is superior to the second, and that the film goes off the proverbial rails a bit in the second half. I'll also concede that the paranormal investigators and a couple of the story elements are a tad over the top and annoying. But to say it can't be any good because it channels Poltergeist or other films is a completely baseless argument. Horror films and indeed most other films ARE derivative; it's just the inevitable result of an industry with a century-long history. The question isn't whether a film uses ideas, plot devices or tropes that other films have used (as, at this point, it's almost impossible not to), the question is, does the new film do it in an effective way while bringing some fresh elements to the mix? Since Insidious in the end is a pretty effective little haunted house variety nail-biter, and definitely one that will several times make your best girl squeeze you tight, in this case the answer is yes. I give it three and three quarters stars and say ""Check it out.""",1323907200,7,4184,4.922096317280453

And the shame of literally lifting entire scenes from POLTERGEIST. These are just the beginning of a laundry list of issues that plagued this somewhat hyped horror release from the same two ass clowns that brought us SAW, and some art school drop out who gave us that other idiot ghost movie with the [expletive] acting that ripped off some other [expletive] movie and blah blah blah... ahhh [expletive] it. This is as predictable as predictable gets and more effective scares could be found in an episode of the Jersey Shore.

I didn't enjoy any aspect of this movie. Everything about the premise to me is either flawed or just downright retarded. You do not develop any sense of connection to the characters, so i ended up not really giving a [expletive] what happened to poor little annoying Dalton or his forgettable family. Woven in between ridiculous diatribes on corny metaphysical theories you are bombarded with dated and tired scare tactics that look as if they were made for an art school project by a moody emo kid.

Cause you are probably going to love this film and you already think i'm some kind of elitist [expletive] who [expletive] hates on everything cause im a bitter old stubborn douche bag. Well i am.

4414730,3,B004LWZW2E,"Insidious is about a young family, Josh, Renai and their three children move into a new house. So far this sounds like any haunted house movie, but there is a few twists. Soon the oldest son of the family, Dalton, have a accident and bumps his head, the kid seams fine however and the family go to bed. The next morning Josh find Dalton lifeless in the bed, the kid have slipped into a deep coma like state which baffles the doctors. Three months later Josh and Renai get to take their son home to care for him there, and that is when creepy stuff start happening around the house.

Now watching this movie you can clearly see that many of the same people that worked on Paranormal Activity also worked on this, however while the former movie worked because of subtle hints and a creepy atmosphere Insidious is about as subtle as a drunk brontosaurus being ra**d by a tyrannosaurus rex. Now I am not saying that every horror movie have to be subtle, however I do think this one had been better if it's producers had learned the lesson from Paranormal Activity that less is more. Almost immediately we have CG ghosts running around in the cupboards and demons in marks lurking in the shadows. Seeing the creatures so quickly do not ruin the movie but it do make it less scary.

As a pleasant surprise about Insidious is that the movie have no gore, it is not that I mind gore, but it is great to see a horror movie lean on it's story and atmosphere rather than open wounds and rolling heads. The music in Insidious is also very good, it helps the scenes and what little scares you can find in this movie generally come from the soundtrack, that being said the movie can get very noisy at times with half a dozen people shouting, the music in the background, doors banging and the ghosts and demons doing their best to be heard over the cacophony, I do recommend having remote nearby to be able to turn the volume down in the most noisy scenes.

Acting wise I think the actors did a ok job, the characters however are a mixed bag. Renai works well, the audience can sympathize with her in her plight, the group of paranormal investigators which is brought in after a while are a hoot, though their often humerus bickering is a bit out of place for the tone of the movie. Josh however do not work, I know he is supposed to be troubled but in reality he only comes off as a jerk.

While watching this movie I could not decide whatever or not I liked it. The concept is good and it is not that often we see the topic of Astral Projection bought up in a horror movie so it feels rather fresh while at the same time following a tried and loved formula. The music of the movie is great and I really liked some of the characters. Insidious however suffers from a problem with the phasing and in addition I think the movie would have been so much better if it had been more subtle. All in all I think Insidious is a good movie which I do recommend, however with all the problems it have I can not give it more than three stars.",1321747200,3,3017,4.287719298245614
4414731,5,B004LWZW2E,"As a horror fan, I always look for something that is genuinely scary (not something that turns out to be ridiculous). As many others have pointed out, Insidious is one such authentic horror movie that has all the elements of classic horror and no nonsense. Here is a summary what it has-
Texture-Perfect texture and tone for a horror. Dark, at times foggy atmosphere, quiet house, spooky attic, you name it, and the movie has it all.
Acting- Realistic characters, not extremists (believer female v/s non-believer male). Everyone has played their role well.
Music- One of the best for horrors. perfect timing, well-balanced highs and lows, and cool jolts.
Story- Very conceivable story. Everything has been explained in the movie, so you don't end up in saying WT* at the end. Of all the horror movies I have seen so far, this is the first time I have seen this concept and I liked it(its not just a haunted house or a possessed body). The script supports the story well.
The director has kept everything so cohesively,that the movie neither loses its grip, nor gets boring anywhere. Wonderful flow from beginning to end!
There is only one drawback I felt. The fact that the evil creatures show up in the second half of the movie slightly dilutes the overall creeepy effect. I am sure it would have been a lot more spooky if they would have adapted the Paranormal activity style (where the fear originates mainly through your imagination, not because of a scary face). I think in today's era, with so much awareness about filmmaking and advanced technology in general, its obvious for everyone to imagine that the 'ghosts' are none but artists with appropriate makeup. Hence, shadows can scare you more than the actual guy standing right in front of you. That's the only point where the movie drops a little.
However, considering the fact that the crew has managed to create an authentic horror flick using all the classical elements (minus all the nonsense that is generally seen in today's movies), Insidious deserves a big applaud. It's not easy to scare people living in 2011 with the old school elements of 70's, but this movie does it, and does it in an excellent way, without compromising on any of the vital elements of a horror flick. Although I like innovations like paranormal activity, I still like to see the classical (and genuine horror). Of all the movies I have seen recently, Insidious is definitely an instant classic of the genre. If you are a horror fan, this has to be in your collection.",1321228800,4,2509,4.756880733944954

Here we get some very creepy scenes of haunting ghosts and demons. The twist is that they move again and viola, the ghosting is back!  I'm no fan of torture-porn films so have so far resisted the ""Saw"" franchise, but their filmmakers are responsible for this goreless horror film.  Technically, it is very effective.

4414833,4,B004LWZW2E,"This is a great old-fashion haunted house movie. The score is creepy, the atmosphere is thick, plenty of shadows, and suspense. Unfortunately, the ending putters about and gets a little hookey, thus losing a star.

A young family has just moved into a new home, when one of the sons mysteriously falls into some kind of unexplainable coma. Now most of the weird things begin. Things move, doors open, voices are heard, figures are seen. Just when the couple thinks that they have solved their problems by moving, we realize the the problem is far worse than a haunted house.

The acting is very well done, and the camera angles and shadows are all thoughtfully arranged. The figures are shown just enough to be scarey, but not too much to lose their edge. Also, there is virtually no blood or bad CGI, which is a nice change to more recent thrillers. And the characters are not stupid, they are appropriately scared, don't want to be alone, look for help when they realize they need it, and they move when they think they have too. Lin Shaye does a great job as a psychic who tries to help them. And while I liked her character, it was at this point in the movie that the pace to begins to slow, as explanations are given.

I won't say that the premise of astral projection is stupid, as others have, because in a scarey, ghost movie, I don't think that many premises would be stupid, pretty much anything goes. However, the pace of the movie slows down. Also, the movie switches gears a bit, from focusing on the mother to focusing on the father. Not that Patrick Wilson did a bad job acting, I just found Rose Byrne more believable and her character more empathic. Also, this is when the ""ghosts"" are on screen more, and this is where the premise of the astral projection becomes a problem - how to show it on screen. I just thought it fell a little flat, and that more could have been done, thus making the ending scarier.

4414835,3,B004LWZW2E,"Director / writer team of the 2004 hit ""SAW,"" James Wan and Leigh Whannell return with ""Insidious,"" a supernatural horror movie about some spooky stuff that happens to a family newly move in. The creator team gives a few nice twists to the storyline that starts out with an ever-popular theme of a ""haunted house,"" and the gore-free film is pretty effective with some good scares ... until the final chapter, which still needs vast improvement.

Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are Josh and Renai Lambert, a happily married couple with three children. However, after moving into a new house, one of their children Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into an inexplicable coma in the house's attic. The Lamberts soon realize there is something strange and sinister going on, something they (and we audiences) have never dreamed of.

But is it? While making effective use of familiar tricks like a banging door and a creepy figure, ""Insidious"" tries to stay one step ahead of the eager fans of the genre. Their attempt succeeds to some extent, with some scary scenes and surprises here and there, though I think jaded horror fans will quickly spot them before they happen, pointing out every borrowed idea from other films.

""Insidious"" also star Barbara Hershey and Lin Shaye. Their acting is very good, though their characters' expository monologues are not, especially when Lin Shaye's character strongly reminds us of Geraldine Chaplin in ""The Orphanage."" After slowly building up the tension, the film ends with the hectic and, to most horror fans, predictable third act.

If I was 13 or 14 ... maybe there would be some scares for me, but I'm in my late 30s and most of the scares were loud music and someone standing somewhere or walking by at particular moments. Maybe my expectations were set too high due to the somewhat good reviews for a horror film. Maybe I was expecting another kid gone bad flick like ""The Omen"" due to the poster and marketing of it. This kid in this is in a coma for most of the film. If there are any future writers of horror films out there ... don't just write toward the scare. Develop characters and story first.

After starting with Season 1 late last year, I recently just finished watching the final episode of Season 5 of the TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Supernatural/dp/B001ECQ4AS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Supernatural</a>. In that series Sam and Dean Winchester are experts at fighting ghosts, demons and an array of supernatural phenomenon. While watching Insidious last night I thought to myself that the only thing missing from the movie was the Winchesters bursting through the door to save the day.

Like Supernatural, Insidious is well done and has its creepy and genuinely scary moments. I knew that Director James Wan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B000EWBKLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>) wouldn't let me down in that department. Look for Wan's ode to Saw with a little drawing of the Jigsaw puppet subtly placed in the middle of Insidious. But give me Supernatural any day versus what ended up being a little predictable and silly with Insidious. The family in Insidious seems to be clear that something unnatural is going on in their house early on in the film. But do you think that stops anyone from going up to the creepy attic to investigate a strange noise in the big spooky house? Of course not.

I think that it was Eddie Murphy in one of his early comedy routines that mocked the family in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amityville-Horror/dp/B000VD5I8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amityville Horror</a>&nbsp;for staying in the house even though at one point in that movie a message from beyond cries ""GET OUT"". A smart family would indeed get out! Well it's kinda the same in Insidious, except the concept is that the person is haunted versus the house...just like in 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity/dp/B002VKE0XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity</a>...so it makes it a little tough to simply get out I guess.

There are some good scares in Insidious....Not just jump out the dark, disturbing image accompanied by a loud bang scares either. But it all seemed a little familiar to me. Perhaps if my skin wasn't so thick these days to ghost stories due to my addiction to Supernatural I'd have been affected a bit more by the movie.

I'm pretty sure that you'll get some nice chills with Insidious. Give it a try if you're into the genre. And definitely give Supernatural a look if you haven't before; the first three seasons were terrific.",1313539200,,2642,5.908376963350785
4414984,4,B004LWZW2E,"The general consensus among Amazon reviewers of Insidious is that the first half of the movie is awesome, and the second half is not so good. Sadly, I could not agree more.

It begins as one of the most effectively creepy haunted house movies I've ever seen. I was positively giddy about it. Then somewhere around the halfway mark, it very suddenly devolves into something that looks like it was made for television. The scenes in ""The Further"" look like they were filmed on location at Spooky World. The general tone, the acting, and the dialog all take an unexpected turn for the worse.

There are a few great moments in the second half that still make it worth watching. I especially liked the bit about the father's childhood photographs.

Ordinarily, I'd give a lower score for such a let down, but I give this movie 4 stars on the strength of its first half alone.  It's that good. If the whole movie had been that good I would have given it 5 stars easily.

This movie is nothing more than an homage to the following movies: ""The Exorcist"", ""Poltergeist"", ""The Amityville Horror"" (1979), ""Ghostbusters"", and ""Star Wars"". Yes, you read it right-- STAR WARS!

In a nutshell: People move into a new house, they think it's haunted, the move, new house seems haunted. Kiddo goes into a ""coma"", Darth Maul makes appearance, all hell breaks loose, call in the exorcist, seems it's not the house that's haunted after all.

As others have stated, the first half of the movie is great, the second half completely destroys any positive strides that the first half made. I myself jumped a couple of times!

I believe that if they had let out the two bumbling ""Ghostbusters"" that this movie might have had a chance.

A message to George Lucas--hope your Darth Maul costume is still stored away, the 'bad guy' in this movie seems to be wearing it!

By the way, I'm a life-long horror movie fan and this one isn't anywhere near as good as ""The Exorcist"". You're better off watching all of the movies that this one seems to be ripping off (listed above).",1312329600,10,1267,4.633928571428571

Also what paranormal activity does very well is that it doesn't show the ""demon"" and when Insidious does show it, its flat out laughable.

It changes from a horror movie to a sci-fi/fantasy movie that is completely inappropriate. If you really want to get a full review of this movie go to: [...],1312156800,2,400,4.569444444444445

I loved Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, so I thought this one should be a decent horror flick.

The demon/devil creature looked like a combination between Nacho Libre's wrestling partner and Darth Maul from Star Wars, that's suppose to be scary?  The story was slow paced and the main character felt lacking.

I love horror flicks and live for them, Insidious had me fall asleep 3 times during the movie and this was when the ""scary"" parts were about to happen.

I tossed the Bluray to a friend, told him to keep it and to never give it back.  I won't rush buy again.",1312156800,6,651,4.391666666666667

It went from creepy horror with promise to corny cheesey, b-movie wanna be.  I won't post an spoilers incase people still decide they want to continue with watching, but be warned.

The last part was some stupid, goofy bad movie which you wouldn't want to have anything to do with.

At first I was fine after watching this but the more I think about the demon the more freaked out I am around my house in the early morning or late at night.

Soon strange things start to occur, like books being knocked off the shelf and boxes being moved to the attic. To make a long story short and without giving anything of importance away, one of the boys is being haunted a little more than the others. I do believe that Isidious and Poltergeist share a lot of similar elements. All in all I did feel slightly uneasy while watching it and had the urge to look over my shoulder, but I didn't jump or feel actually scared. While the ending is somewhat predictable, I just accepted that I knew what was gonna happen just let myself enjoy it.

4415182,5,B004LWZW2E,"A movie with some real genuine scares. I'm 44 yrs old, I've found some of the younger generation have been de-sensitized when comes to at least horror movies. The movie has genuine scares relying on sounds, lighting, good costume and make-up, an overall atmosphere set nicely for a some good scares. Horror movies are not all about blood splatter, gore & CGI effects. Real horror movies that want to scare you will have a good atmosphere, good acting and a decent script, this movie has it all.
  For the reviewers that complain about the ending, it's an ending thats in-line with a ""Twilight Zone"" twist type ending. For most those that are in their 20's they probably won't understand that. Basically not every movie has to have a happy ending, or even one that will answer every single question for you throughout to the end of the movie.
  If a movie ends with an un-expected event that may leave you hanging....then the writers did their job...they caught you off gaurd and you'll have to use your imagination to finish the story.
  My 22 yr old step-daughter told me when I asked her if the movie was any good? She said ""your not missing nothing and a dumb ending"". I took that chance and watched it. I found that she did not grow up with shows like ""Outer Limits"" or ""Twilight Zone"" which often had a slight twist at the end. If you have no clue on how those shows generally ended up, then you may not get this movie at all.
  I will agree with some reviewers about the scene when the Father checks the front door the first time and it wasn't even locked to begin with, then he doesnt even lock it after closing it back, but only puts on the chain lock, that would be poor scene on part of the screenwriter, aside from that no issues with this one.

I found myself grinning as I was thinking this was the long overdue return to form for a genre that I consider dead. Things start to fall apart as the third act begins. A movie concerning any topic than is not fully understood, but told in a realistic manor, should never explain the unknown. The movie switches from haunting to supernatural rescue and too many answers are given and too much paranormal activity is shown for a hardened movie cynic to suspend his disbelief. I feel a smart movie should present all the evidence and leave a viewer to draw their own conclusion. The ending is horrible and I feel all movies that end with such a cheap shot should come with a warning. So you are warned -- the ending is abrupt and totally unsatisfying. I guess you could label it as surprising if this is the first horror movie you have ever seen. I cant understand why any movie would end in the middle of a scene other than a writer being unable to write anything worthwhile and trying to play it off as clever.

4415186,4,B004LWZW2E,"Insidious is a movie that blends many different types of horror movies. It works for the most part. The movie is about a coupel with two kids, one of the kids goes into a coma. The doctors don't know when he will come out so they take him home only to have creepy events happen in their house. They come to find its not the house that haunted. The film starts slow with a very tense feel to it and this tone stays with the whole film. The director (James Wan) really builds suspense. The soundtrack whilst does have an orchestra at times, uses mostly organic sounds to give the movie a heartbeat one example there is a grandfather clock that has a beat that builds more suspense than orchestras. The acting is strong and believable. The movie is one of a new trend of horror movies that has a very low budget, making the director use his imagination. Paranormal Activity started this popular trend and Insidious borrows form the feel of it. After 30 minutes of this, the movie switches from the Paranormal Activity routes to a more original feel that many may be lost on, but It gives the movie a fresh take and separates it from other house haunting movies. The movie is a rare PG-13 movie that people enjoyed. It has zero gore, but replaces it with many well built jump scares. With a little more development in the last act this movie could have been amazing, but I still enjoyed it and it made me jump a few times which I hardly do.",1311292800,3,1436,4.361940298507463

It's good to see a movie come out with all of the creepiness and none of the gore. I rank it up there with The Sixth Sense and Ghost Story. I honestly wasn't expecting much with a PG13 rating, but I was very pleased---loved all of the spooks popping up here and there. A must-see that is destined to be a classic!!!!",1311292800,12,465,4.065217391304348
4415268,3,B004LWZW2E,"As the title implies, I have very mixed feelings about this movie. I didn't go into it with high expectations. I've learned not to do that with horror movies anymore. Especially ones that are touted as ""the next [fill in the blank]."" Once this movie got rolling, though, I became very excited. The first half was excellent. It was tense, atmospheric, and downright creepy. I am, admittedly, a jaded old horror snob. I haven't been legitimately scared by a movie since I saw ""The Exorcist"" for the first time, when I was nine (and that was 22 years ago). On the same token, I also do not judge a horror movie by how ""scary"" it is. I judge it by the atmosphere presented and whether or not the writing and film-making capture and hold my attention. If the movie can get a few jumps out of me in the process, that's a fun plus... But it's not the sole criteria by which I evaluate a horror movie anymore.  To his credit, James Wan really showed his chops as an editor and director in the first half of the movie. And Leigh Whannel seemed to have put together an excellent story that melded supernatural horror with very real horror (especially if you're a parent). The music also added a lot to the overall feel. It wasn't your standard synth drones that have become the hallmark of every horror flick made after 1970. They actually had real orchestral instruments, and some great dissonant violin that made my spine feel all twisty.

Yes, it was all very derivative. Overall, the first half of ""Insidious"" was basically a hybrid of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Poltergeist,"" as many have already noted, and there were also elements of ""Flowers in the Attic,"" which I have not seen noted... But it was so well executed that any unoriginality was forgivable. And, besides, if you're gonna rip *anyone* off, you may as well rip off the best! The first half of the movie presented believable characters in a scary situation that was made scary by what you didn't see or what you barely saw, and did not over-rely on rubber monsters or obvious CG effect that ultimately detract from the overall chill factor. It was a total throwback to classic horror movies, that had me on the edge of my seat with excitement. Not just excitement for what was happening on-screen, but excitement for the genre as a whole.

Then, about half way into the movie, Darth Maul made a guest appearance. Well, maybe not *actually* Darth Maul... But a ""demon"" that looked a lot like him. It was all downhill from there.

The latter half of the movie became a straight-up cartoon. All the great set-up and intensity that was established in the beginning was pushed over like a house of cards.  It started with an out-of-place, overtly comedic pair of over-the-top nerdy ghost hunters (one of whom uses a modified ViewMaster to see ghosts... I s**t you not).  When Lin Shaye's psychic character came into the picture, I had some hope. Lin is a veteran actress who really knows how to control the screen, and her character seemed interesting enough. She even flirted with the idea of sending her two ghost-goobers away, which made me think: ""Ok. Cool. The comic relief was here to lighten the mood, so that we could be once again slapped-around with the horror stick when we were just getting comfortable."" Alas, that was not the case, and this film's equivalent of Jar Jar Binks was in it for the long haul. (Wow! I'm really racking up the ""Phantom Menace"" references here, aren't I?)

The rest of the movie did the exact opposite of what the first half had established. It took all of the ghosts and brought them into the green-filtered light of day, in all of their overly-made-up glory. The whole thing took on an atmosphere similar to the yearly spookhouse that the local YMCA puts on for Halloween. But the thing that makes the spookhouse fun and scary is that you are actually in the middle of it, stumbling around in the dark and wondering who is going to pop out at you next. ""Insidious"" didn't have that same value, since it was just a guy on a screen stumbling around in the dark and the camera angles made it pretty obvious when and where someone was going to pop out at him. Frankly, it was boring.  Now, don't get me wrong. The in-your-face monster atmosphere can work in a movie. It worked for the ""Evil Dead"" movies. It works in slasher movies. Heck, it even worked in the contemporary version of ""Thirteen Ghosts."" But the thing that made it work there is that the threat existed of the monsters actually *doing something* to the person whose face they are getting into. When monsters gets all up in your grill, they have to spew something, or attack, or try to swallow your soul, or something.  The ghosts/monsters in ""Insidious"" basically just popped up in front of the hero, made a funny noise and an ooky face, then backed off. It was like a haunted game of Whack-a-Mole. Ultimately it came off as more silly than scary, and totally invalidated everything that the first half of the movie worked so hard to set up.

As for the ending: I won't spoil it, but I have mixed feelings about it too. On one hand, it made perfect sense given the way everything had been set up. On the other hand, it wasn't all that creative. Movies ending this way have become the standard for ""edgy"" horror in Western film-making, but haven't actually been ""edgy"" for about half a decade because it's what everybody does. It's often said that a bad ending can ruin a good movie, and a good ending can justify a bad movie. This movie proves that a mediocre ending keeps a movie mediocre.

Given their history together, I suspect that Wan and Whannel wanted to make a vastly different movie (they created the ""Saw"" franchise, after all), but the studio wanted a PG-13 horror movie, and so the writer and director toned it down accordingly. Unfortunately, the tone-down came across as a water-down. Honestly, if they had stuck to the format that they established in the beginning, and built it to a climax that way, this movie could have been great and nowhere near an R rating. ""The Others"" did this exceedingly well, back in 2001. Wan and Whannel obviously know how to make a good, unsettling, psychological horror movie. Maybe next time they'll be consistent about it.

Let's try to end this on a positive note. The first half of the movie was excellent. The music was great. I give props to the director for using human actors, lighting, and camera tricks to tell his story, and not falling back on crappy CG. The first half of the movie shows that there is still hope for the Hitchcock school of horror. And, even in her sixties, Barbara Hershey is still gorgeous. So, good going on all of that. On the whole, I give this 2.5 stars, out of 5.  It had a boatload of potential, but sadly fell flat.",1311206400,34,6753,4.566473988439307
4415269,5,B004LWZW2E,"This movie reminded me of a new age Poltergeist, with the exception of more freakishly animalistic villains.  I would highly recommend cutting off the lights and watching this movie.  One of the best horror movies that has been released in a long time!  I was left with a jaw dropped facial expression in more than one scene, and better yet you will find yourself secluded from others in the room, who are watching the movie with you!  Definitely a movied to add to my horror collection, and yes as some critics grip about, the sound quality isn't what it should be (i.g. the sound increases exponentially when a monster introduces itself, and then drops when the characters are speaking, but nonetheless, this is something you can work with!",1311206400,4,742,4.7734375
4415270,2,B004LWZW2E,"There's a guy in my office that occasionally hides under my work desk and yells ""BOO"" when I return from the restroom. Sometimes he jumps out from the coat closet near the front door, or hides behind the wall adjacent to the office kitchen. Every time he uses the same lame ""BOO"" scream because he's too stupid to properly construct an effective scare. It worked the first few times but now it's totally worthless. He can't scare me. I, on the other hand, will occasionally hide behind his door in the morning before he arrives. His office lights are usually off and the lighting is dim. He'll walk into his office, feel someone's presence, turn around and see a shadow near the door. Is it a part of his imagination or is it real? He squints his eyes for a few seconds and then notices that someone is actually there. It scares the crap out of him every time, and I don't even need to scream ""BOO!"" Ironically, sometimes when I don't do it he'll stop by my office and say, ""Man, I thought I saw you this morning.""

This very basic difference between amateur shock tactics and well-constructed sequences of terror is something that 21st Century American filmmakers ignore with reckless abandon. In case you hadn't noticed, the American horror industry has sucked for quite some time, and one major reason is that they almost always go for the cheapest, laziest routes to producing scares. In the case of Insidious, it's jump scares supplemented with 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs. If Insidious limited itself to 2 or 3 such moments (or even 4 or 5), then it could have saved enough room for more mature, expertly crafted horror elements. Unbelievably, Insidious tosses in approximately 20 jump scares, an unacceptable descent into unprecedented laziness. The condensed nature of the jumps falls prey to the law of diminishing returns. It would be like the guy at my office jumping in front of me and yelling ""BOO"" every 3 minutes. It quickly becomes a parody of itself.

Brian Salisbury from ""Film School Rejects"" makes some good points in his review of Insidious, so I'd like to quote him here: ""Seriously, horror filmmakers: put a moratorium on jump scares. I know everyone and their brother is using jump scares as a counterattack against increasingly desensitized audiences, but it's time to give up the ghost (pun only slightly intended). I got sick and tired of something popping up like Jack-in-the-Box every five seconds obscuring my vision from the much more interesting, and far scarier, story going on behind it. Jump scares are the junk food of horror films - providing only superficial and extremely temporary sensory nourishment. Soon enough, your brain is hungry again for that fear response and jump scares are about as substantial as eating a box of Twinkies on Thanksgiving Day. When you watch the Oscars and the category of Achievement in Sound Mixing comes up (you know, when you normally make a trip to the bathroom), you may ponder on the value of a film's sound mixer or sound designer. Five minutes into Insidious, you will understand the dire necessity of these artists if only by virtue of the fact that we're subjected to their spectacular failures for 90 minutes. Every apparition carries with it its own deafening shriek and every jump scare is heralded with an explosion of disharmonious (read: eardrum-shredding) violins. It seems to be operating under the same delusion as Drag Me to Hell that loud = scary. But, along with jump scares, incessant loud noises are the charlatans of fright. We are not infants, so please refrain from resorting to the same tactics that terrify barely cognitive life forms.""

That sums things up nicely. The praise that Insidious has earned for it's cheap scare tactics should be concerning for fans of the genre, because a transition from the recent torture/gore trend towards jump scare compilations isn't much of a progression for the pitiable American horror industry. Take away the 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs and almost none of the jumps will work on your mainstream cinephile. (And by ""work"" I'm using the generous term ""startle"", which is probably the laziest way to scare someone.) The storyline is stupid, the acting is mediocre at best, the dialogue ranges from decent to lame, and the dramatic elements are limp. The only true positive is the fairly brisk pacing that keeps things from getting unbearably boring.

Despite everyone I know complaining about my biased preference for Japanese and South Korean horror, it's pretty damn obvious that my fellow Americans are simply too incompetent to construct long-sustained sequences of terror, produce dense atmosphere, develop interesting psychological/philosophical elements, use ambiguity properly, patiently utilize deliberate pacing to build tension, or supplement horror with good story lines and characters. If Insidious is the creme de la creme of modern American horror, then it's time to write an epitaph.",1311120000,,4940,5.013398294762485

This is any horror writer/director's wet dream, whatever the nay sayers may write.  He uses his obvious talent with puppets to maximum effect, lifting the rather mundane plot (a child hits his head and falls into something that is not quite a coma, but something else) and transforms it into a truly terrifying film. Wan is an uneven talent who often cashes in, but he was taking things quite seriously with this one.

Patrick Wilson (always great at playing a creepy man in whatever he's in) and Rose Byrne (a phenomenal actress judging from this) are a couple with a secret they don't know about: their son's (and husband's) talent for astral projection, a fancy term for those who have the talent for leaving their own bodies.  As soon as their son Dalton (child actor Ty Simpkins) falls into his semi-non-coma, some really screwy things begin to happen around the household.

What makes this film so frightening on a visceral level is that Wan is unafraid to turn the whole ordeal into a derangement of perception almost immediately.  You really can't trust anybody except Rose Byrne's character.

One of the young sons has the ability to leave his body through astral projection, also known as spirit walking, and becomes lost in the spirit world.  His shell of as body is now attracting spirits, evil ones, who want to come back into the real world.  Throw in some unexplained whispering and closing doors into the mix.  Enter the ghost hunters, a really laughable group, who must help the boy's spirit return.  The father, Patrick Wilson, who also has the ability to spirit walk, must venture into the spirit world to help his son find his way back.

------------------------------

At times the movie and its spirits reminded me of a cheap ""Funhouse"" carnival ride.
The only thing scary one might find in this movie of worn out clichs is that their name may appear in the credits.  There are plenty of good horror movies out there, skip this one, but if you must see it go to your local library and check it out for free.  ""Insidious"" is worthy of only 1 Star.",1310860800,12,1434,4.871900826446281
4415370,1,B004LWZW2E,"I originally had seen previews on TV and a spot in EW that both gave me the idea that this would be a really scary and creepy movie.  The cast also kind of lead me to believe it would be decent, I mean Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrn and Barbara Hershey are all fantastic actors.  For the life of me though I just don't understand why anyone would consider this movie good or scary.

As some people have mentioned, the first half of the movie and the second half of the movie are almost totally different plot lines.  When the family moves to the second house the plot just takes this huge leap from demonic possession/haunting to astral-projection and the fun-house horror of ""The Further"".  I actually would have been on board with the plot leap and the terrible pacing if the effects hadn't been so utterly absurd.

When Josh goes into ""The Further"" the movie quickly goes from a decent horror movie to a campy romp at the local fair's house of horrors.  Even low-budget movies should have better costume design than this, I've seen scarier Halloween costumes than anything that was presented in ""The Further""!  I'm usually kind of a chicken when it comes to horror movies, but the second half of this movie was just so ridiculous I was too distracted to be scared.  Everything about this movie was kind of reminiscent of a really bad, really cheesy B horror movie from the 1950s, to the point where I started to think that maybe that was what the filmmakers were going for.

Other things I didn't like were the plot twist (very predictable from fairly early on) and the film's music score.  The music didn't really add suspense at all, it was just jarring and kind of kept me from getting too scared.  Overall, I'd say the preview for this movie was much better than the movie itself and I don't understand why its been so well-received.",1310860800,19,1835,4.544072948328267
4415371,5,B004LWZW2E,"I really liked this movie, its been a long time since i have seen a horror movie that seemed to pull me in. its very well acted, directed and writen. my hats off to all who helped make this move. I personnaly thought the Tiny Tim music that the demon played was a very good added touch!!

buy / rent / make it a point to see this movie if your a horror fan you won't regret it!!!",1310860800,8,379,3.858974358974359
4415372,3,B004LWZW2E,"First, I agree with jce3 about the movie, well...at least the latter part of the movie, being in the tradition of the 1980's Poltergeist.  Also, I echo about what Mathematically Handicapped says about ""Darth Mal"" look alike doing a cameo in the movie.  If they would have spent more time on the latter half of the plot and taking out the ""Darth Mal"" look alike, the movie would have been more impressive.

Usually a haunted House or a ghost story movie ends when the family moves out of the house.  But this movie did not end even when the family moves out and into another home which is brighter and  quaint.  This kind of made it interesting enough to watch the remainder of this film.  Also, the ghost/demons did not always appear in lonely, dark and dismal settings, but also in the plain light of day in the suburbs -and still retaining the chilling effect. Not to many movies like that out there that has that, except for paranormal activity(1 and 2).  I hope they do not milk this and come out with a sequel.  Keep it as is.  Oh, th  violin sound effects were classy in the beginning.

It does have the creepy factor for those who live alone or at least isolated with an active imagination or even with a semi-active one.  Also, after watching this movie,  they probably will be sleeping with the lights on and plugging their ears with cotton so they will not allow themselves to hear any (new) noises throughout their home.",1310774400,,1431,4.496124031007752

It delivers when it comes to horror. It was done very well.. from acting, scripting, and music! The eery music add's to the classic horror film feel and the rest kicks it up a notch to bring a new level of horror not seen in movies in years.",1310774400,,462,4.202247191011236

4415376,5,B004LWZW2E,"I found this to be a sort of updated Poltergeist. While not a true reboot, it does have some of the same mix. A small child caught up in an unknown ""otherworld"", 2 parents and 2 siblings left to deal, a trio of experts to help the family out, and in the end a parent goes in to retrieve the child.
Now I'm sure others will question my analogy, but it's how I saw things.
As for the movie, it has a nice spooky element to it that sets the pace all the way through. Small things at first leading up to many more unexplained happenings. The scares were not in your face, although there were a few well placed got ya moments! Overall I enjoyed this movie and consider it one of the better horror movies to come out in recent years. I will be buying the blu ray version as it does have a few special features not on the DVD.",1310774400,8,819,4.030674846625767
4415377,4,B004LWZW2E,"OK, the pacing may have been a little off towards the end and the paranormal investigators perform a few comedy bits you've seen before.

However, Rose Byrne manages to portray a freaked out mother without replaying every other freaked out mother you've seen.  Patrick Wilson plays a vacuous, but amiable husband who just wants peace and quiet.  Barbara Hershey plays a very small part.  Lin Shaye gives the most comfortable performance - you've seen her in many movies - as a clairvoyant.  She did the best work of anyone.  The craftsman bungalow also plays a huge role in this movie - lots of running up and down those stairs.

Picture-wise, this is best seen on a TV instead of a small notebook LCD monitor - a lot of detailed dark shots.

As of July 2011, this and 'The Bleeding House' are my favorite online scary movie releases this year.",1310774400,3,844,4.617449664429531

This movie relies on the slow burn....cranking up your nerves with small jumps and tense music. It builds and builds, until it finally dumps a bucket of crazy on you. If you love good supernatural horror movies, then you know good ones don't come along very often. This movie caught me a little off guard. It's a jump inducing, butt puckering, scarefest with minimal hokiness. One of my favorites since Drag Me to Hell...",1310774400,,548,4.903225806451613
4415469,3,B004LWZW2E,"First I would have to say that I am an avid horror movie fan. I enjoy the gore and the mental scares. I enjoy everything from ""The Birds"" to ""LeatherFace"" to ""Twilight Zone"". Here's why I gave it 3 stars:

#1: For me, the art cover of this movie is misleading. Because, well without giving the whole story away, the boy on the cover is actually not that much in the movie. -2

#2: The first half of the movie reminded me of Paranormal Activity (which I dislike and was a HUGE disappointment). The second half is where the actual action starts. But the only scares are the cheap loud music tempos and the pop-up shots of scary characters. You know the ones that pop up real quick in front of the camera to try and scare you like the ones in a haunted house. +1

#3: I would say that this was an okay rental but definitely NOT a purchase. I was very interested after I saw the previews and rent some of the reviews here. It made it seem like it was a mix of the Poltergeist and Exorcist. But unfortunately, I would rather consider it a mix between Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. +1

#4: I think if the director/writers really applied themselves to this movie, it could've been an awesome mental thriller - one that everyone would remember and would have been part of their Halloween routine. -2

#5: I would just like to also add that this movie should not be viewed by children. Simply because they do not understand how astral projections work and may try to experiment with it not only causing damage to their selves but to others. If you do decide to allow your children to watch them, please explain to NOT COPY what they are seeing. It is very dangerous and very real.",1310688000,,1686,4.356687898089172
4415470,4,B004LWZW2E,"Wow! Caught this on Amazon's Video On Demand in HD using the Roku! VERY CREEPY!
This is a great example of how a movie does not have to be gory or graphically violent to be scary.
PG-13 rating as it may scare younger children.
A slightly different twist on a Ghost movie.
I'll probably end up buying this one on Blu-Ray at some point.
A few brief scenes were a bit too dark and showed some pixelation on the HD stream but otherwise very clean stream from Amazon.
The only thing that didn't really work for me were the scenes with the primary baddie (fire face guy) in the film. I won't elaborate as I don't want to spoil anything but I could see most of that cut from the film. Most of the wrestling stuff could have been cut as well as it didn't really fit the mood.",1310688000,,767,4.154362416107382
4415471,2,B004LWZW2E,"""It's not the house that's haunted,"" the ads tell us, and how right they are. It's ""Insidious"" that's haunted by every possessed-by-another-world melodrama ever made. Even people who seem to like this misfire confess they recognize it as a hodgepodge of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Poltergeist"" with a little ""The Shining"" thrown in. That professional critics (granted, of the radio variety) could have found something admirable here gives you a pretty scary idea of today's critical standards. The ten-thumbed direction is by James Wan, who has sawed his way through half a dozen pieces of low-grade lumber, and his screenplay is by Leigh Wannell, the producer/writer of what is commercially called the Saw franchise. This ill-conceived plot concerns a young couple with three kids who, moving into a new house, are disturbed by all sorts of specters and strange occurrences. It gets so bad they buy another house; and how Dad manages to casually buy various houses on a teacher's salary is not explained. As it turns out, the second house is spooky too, so of course they consult an expert in the paranormal.  (Actually, these houses don't need ghost busters so much as they need a can of three-in-one: you've never heard so many squeaky doors in all your life.) It seems the couple's young son, who's supposedly in a coma, is really out among the ghoulies on ""the other side"" and must be rescued by his father, who has been there himself as a boy. Derivative? Well, yes, there's even a visual reference to the steak scene in ""Poltergeist"". Suspenseful? Not at all. Having sat through ""Insidious"" (I tried to watch it again to verify my impression, but I just couldn't make it), my belief is that James Wan should be sent back to film school with M Night Shyalaman.",1310688000,2,1759,4.843853820598007
4415472,3,B004LWZW2E,"This is the type of movie that makes me wonder if movie producers sit around a table and say ""it should be scary, but not too scary, or it won't appeal to a wide audience..."" I wonder what the result would be if someone actually tried to make a movie that was really terrifying. In my opinion, the scariest movies let you invent the bad guy in your own mind, based upon the little hints and things that the movie shows you. If you reveal the bad guy and he looks like a dude wearing a lot of makeup and a costume, it takes all of the suspense away. And it makes the audience members feel like a bunch of ninnies for being so unnerved to begin with. I liked what another reviewer said about the demon looking like Darth Mal from Star Wars. I agree- except Darth Mal was much scarier.

I am a big fan (and critic) of horror movies. This one was edgy and intriguing in the beginning, and I agree with a lot of others in that the whole thing took a downward turn around 3/4 of the way through. Its funny, you watch enough movies and you start to be able to pinpoint the exact moment when the script or the action loses you. I guess the acceptable level of ridiculousness is different for everyone, but this one presses the boundaries of even the most accepting audiences.

Overall, I liked it, despite my complaints. A girl can like something even though she thinks its silly, right? (there are so many jokes that could potentially be inserted here that I have opted out altogether). The ending didn't completely ruin the whole thing, but I walked away from it giggling instead of being slightly creeped out.",1310601600,3,1604,4.361204013377926

4415474,2,B004LWZW2E,"Because there are people out there who might believe this could really happen. Out of body traveling.

A couple scenes were good. The demon with the red face and the fork tongue was interesting. The people with the stupid grins were good as well but that was all I liked about this movie. The whole concept of a person traveling out of his or hers body. without being dead is fiction. I bought the Blu-Ray hoping it would really make the movie good. No chance. I want my $19.99 back.

4415475,5,B004LWZW2E,"Okay, I'm not going to go into what the movie is about, because I think that most of us already know that by now.  What I will tell you is that this movie terrified me in the theatre, and I bought the DVD, already knowing what goes on in the movie, and it terrified me all over again.  The bad thing is that my Mom, who lives in a nursing home, asked me to bring it and watch it with her. She loves horror movies as much as I do, and when she was home, that's how we spent our Friday nights. I took it to watch with her last night, and because she's hard of hearing, we have to close her door so we don't disturb anyone.  Well, all I can say is that during one part of the movie, I yelled so loudly, that one of the nurses came in to see if everything was okay.  So, yeah, this is one very, scary movie, or it was for me, and I'm sure somewhere down the road I'll watch it again and get scared all over again, but you know, whether you go to a theatre or sit in the comfort of your own home, if you are going to watch a scary movie, you want just that, a scary movie, and if it fails to scare you, I don't know about you, but I feel cheated.

This is definitely one of the best in years. Ty Simpkins really stood out, not just because his character was the focal point of the movie but because he was so believable. The rest of the cast was amazing. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne gave exceptional performances that ran the gamut of a multitude of emotions. The story was creative and new yet there was also a sense of familiarity. The overall movie mixed just the right amount of drama and fright. Congruent to movies in this category the music is essential and it just added to the element and provided a really great backdrop to an already terrifying in-your-face picture. If you're looking for a good scare and I mean a really good scare that's not at all over-the-top this movie is a must-see. Remember, don't repeat the surprise shock ending.",1310515200,2,950,4.627218934911243
4415547,4,B004LWZW2E,"Let me start by saying I actually liked this movie, well I like most of this movie. The first 3/4 of this movie is genuinely suspenseful and at some points even scary. Unfortunately this movie, like many others in the genre, hits a major setback in the last act. It suffers an identity crisis! This movie becomes a huge mess of some of the best and mostly worst moments of Poltergeist, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Inception. I was disappointed with the way the movie turned out after such superb acting and the outstanding visuals throughout most of the film. Rose Byrne (I highly recommend two of her other movies Sunshine and Bridesmaids) who plays Renai did an excellent job making the fear believable which goes a long way in this kind of Paranormal Activity themed movie. These kind of movies are becoming more and more popular these days...you know the formula, 45 minutes of doors slamming unexplainably, dishes or other household items flying across the room or falling off shelves, strange voices being heard from upstairs, blurry or shadowy figures seen in windows or dark areas of hallways. Then there's the last 45 minutes where it gets more intense and things actually start happening. Overall, this method has proven effective and enjoyable.

Concering the technicle specs on the movie I have no complaints. The Blu Ray picture quality and sound on this movie is crisp and clear. The extras on the disc are worth watching.

Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I just had a tough time with the way the last 30 minutes went. It really dragged the movie down. The fire demon had a lot of potential, but ended up being comical rather than terrifying. I would suggest this movie to anyone that enjoys modern horror movies.",1310515200,,1727,4.7725752508361206
4415548,5,B004LWZW2E,"I dare you to watch this movie ALONE at night!  Then ask yourself was it scary. This is the perfect blend of realism without overwhelming special effects that are empty in meaning and corny background music that tries to fake you out.  This is a really good story that builds on itself (meaning what you watch in the beginning and what characters do and say comes to make sense in the plot later in the movie) is played out before your eyes with only a few special effects until you are captured in the movie and then come the real special effects that literally take you into that other world and blow your mind away.  When I say other world I literally mean it takes you into another world and keeps you there as the characters travel and have to discover how to survive between the two.  Maybe this is what throws some viewers off when So many horror movies give you a killer or evil spirit that only is to be known as an enemy with no soul that just kills because something once bad happened to him or it.  This movie has actual character, human and evil to make you really scared of it.  I repeat This movie gives you a world of horror and takes you there with subtlety and later in the movie complete boldness.  This movie is great also on its different take of horror & original in many circumstances. Maybe some people want that typical horror movie where someone is possessed and needs an exorcism or where sounds go on in a house and come to find out it is the dead girl who was once raped and now seeks revenge by killing every human in her without ever communicating with anyone.  It's my favorite horror movie probably since The Others (which was another movie with true horror and a lot less special fx). I would love to spoil the movie for anyone, but just suffice it to say I rent 99% of the 200 movies a year I see and I choose to buy this.",1310342400,2,1857,4.255681818181818

I am super picky and take nothing in life as it comes without looking at it from all angles. I can usually tear apart a movie within minutes of watching it. My friends hate watching movies news or TV shows with me because I don't miss a beat, I see all mistakes and holes instantly. But the reason I am doing a review on this movie is because In my opinion it really kicked ass but then again its only my opinion. I would have changed very little, a few things I would have changed is when the kid appeared in the second house when he changed the music and started dancing it killed the creepiness of the mood. He should have just been standing in front of the record player after he changed the music. Then when she tracked him down the way he jumped out of the cabinet kind of killed the mood the bad acting kind of threw me off. Then when the family who was shot by the smiling girl showing the act of the murders happened it kind of killed the mood and pace again you could tell they where trying too hard to weird you out. Other than that this movie gets on to a fast moving pace and doesn't stop and the spirits start showing up right away. I love the concepts and idea's in this movie the astral projection seemed really interesting to me. It may be a hodge podge of a few other movies but they did a good job at what they put together and don't take to much from single film in the past. It seems like the 1st half of the movie is much scarier than the second and it seemed like it became hard for the director to finish off such an excellent 1st half. Now my point here is I have been through hell in real life and the fear in my brain has vanished after being so terrified in my life, coming close to death many times over and over again until my fears finally vanished. But this movie really creped me out and had me looking over my shoulder in my place after I finished watching it. This movie made me feel alive again lol. What I really liked is it was a blind watch, I knew nothing of the movie before I viewed it. This will be a day one blu ray buy for me.

4415554,2,B004LWZW2E,"Let me outline a movie for you, and tell me if you've seen it before:  The first 30 minutes or so introduce you to a normal family.  You discover that they are all nice folks and are probably in the process of moving or changing schools.  Weird stuff starts to happen.  After an appropriate period of time where the skeptical family member doubts anything paranormal is happening, the experts are called in to describe what sorts of beings from ""the other side"" are afflicting the house or family.  There is a battle of some sort which is won after various travails and all appears to be well.  But it's not!  They missed something and we're left with a final creepy scene.

How many horror films of the past decade or two did I just describe?  I hope you won't feel I've spoiled Insidious for you, but it's exactly the same as all the others.  There are some genuinely creepy moments (and some that just came off as silly), but the characters are cut out of cardboard and nearly the exact same plot has been done and done better.  When you use such a standard plot, something else has to set the movie apart.

Let me illustrate with a parallel.  I just watched Super 8.  The plot is also rather standard and includes the ""evil military man"" trope that I typically hate.  But Abrams made me care about his characters.  They had hopes and fears and real depth.  If they had been replaced with the type of generic cereal box characters from Insidious, I wouldn't have given a damn if those prop room mannequins lived or died and the plot would not have held up to that.

If you have nothing better to do with your evening or haven't ever seen a modern paranormal horror film, then Insidious is a passable by-the-numbers thriller with a few jumps. But it's cheaper and faster to just convince your friend to scare you some time when you come out of the bathroom.",1308960000,6,1859,4.449704142011834

Trying to escape the haunting and save their son, they move again only to discover that it was not their house that was haunted.

This is an excellent supernatural horror-thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also keeps your heart racing and mind thinking, as well. This is one of the best horror-thrillers of the year, so far. This is James Wan's & Leigh Whannell's best movie since ""Saw"". This is another hit from the producers of ""Paranormal Activity"" & ""Saw"".",1302912000,3,2767,5.144444444444445

8435082,3,B004LWZW2E,"I don't understand the high ratings. I loved the story line, but I thought the ghosts and demons were cheesy! If they had made them more scary looking, I might have loved the movie but I expected to be scared from beginning to end and for me this movie just didn't do it for me. I did like the twist ending though, and am praying that the other movies are better since I bought the whole trilogy on prime!",1527552000,,405,4.139240506329114
