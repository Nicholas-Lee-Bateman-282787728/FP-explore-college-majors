4483905,5,B004VQRCAK,"This version of Day Of The Triffids was much closer to the original book the the early version.
Af few character changes here and there, but still pretty close.
As you would expect, the Triffids were much better special effects.
Very enjoyable and worth a watch.",1349740800,5,262,4.717391304347826
4483906,5,B004VQRCAK,"Great movie! Nice to see a reasonable remake of the original. More of a made for TV movie feel, but overall ... decent entertainment.",1489017600,2,133,4.583333333333333
4483907,3,B004VQRCAK,The story line was good but was very disappointed that this was a beginning of a series.  So this one ends with a lead to the series so no ending. I wouldn't have gotten it knowing that since I can't find the rest of the series. I still like the original but this version seems to be good but only wish now I could see more. I'm not a person who enjoys cliff hanger movies. I would have given 5 stars if it had been a complete movie with an ending,1486425600,8,447,3.912087912087912
4483908,5,B004VQRCAK,"In many ways this was better than the original one with Howard Kiel.  Those were very stiff moving, whereas these plants move like lightning speed at times, very animated, and can grab you, plus the story filled in many of the missing parts that I wondered about the first one.  Like how did the Triffids come to be, where the stingers came from etc.  Well worth the money to purchase and time to watch.",1468886400,7,403,4.418918918918919
4483909,5,B004VQRCAK,I like the second version of this movie the first version was very nice this one difference in some aspects but still a good movie and decent actors,1466640000,,148,4.321428571428571

4483914,5,B004VQRCAK,"Though I loved the 63 original version better  which starred Howard Keel THIS TV version was quite good!  The special effects and story were well done and I was glad I bought the blu ray version afterall -  I Hope they will remastered and put to blu ray the Original but as far as this one I would highly recommend  it!!  Enjoy!

4483915,4,B004VQRCAK,"If the ad has not been updated this does not specify what region it was recorded for.  I have one of the most expensive Sony Blue-ray players available, less than 60 days old and less than 5 months for the model, this does not play.

Of course this review is not for the BD movie content, it is for the fact that region was unspecified.  I would advise only purchasing if you know your player will play multiple regions.  Amazon would get a 1 star for  not including the region in the ad but 5 star for prompt refund.  Wish it had played, would have loved to have seen the updated version of the 60's film.

REVISED;

I took the advice of the person who commented and bought the blue ray (which I would have done in the first place had i not overlooked it) and that solved the viewing problem.

This is a rock solid 4 Star minimum scifi offering.  It isn't really a sequel to the original in the sense that it continues the original story but is set at a point not too distant from that.  The acting, directing, and writting are very strong.  It may not be 5 Star but is well worth owning.  It actually leaves you wishing this were picked up as a series with all parties to the development here offered retained and with the freedom The Walking Dead has been given.  Own it on Blue Ray, you'll be happy with your purchase!",1349740800,17,1322,4.236

8443847,3,B004VQRCAK,Disappointed with this movie. This version of the movie is more of a TV series than a movie. The original version was great. I was hoping you would have enhance on the storyline and the CGIon this version. I was very disappointed.,1512172800,3,230,4.5
8443848,5,B004VQRCAK,Better than the original.,1510012800,,25,5.5
8443849,2,B004VQRCAK,"I truly loved the original movie from 1963 and had such high hopes for this modern and updated remake.....I was so disappointed. I mean the beginning started out with such promise, much like the original with the sky storm and the blindness that followed. Such a talented cast too and all were wasted. Dougray Scott, Joely Richardson, Jason Priestley etc and all that talent is wasted. As I said what began as a great start, deteriorated into the typical groups all vying for dominance over what is left of the world. Dull and not very well thought out at all. I made if for about 80 minutes before I got bored with how trite it was. Very formulaic and not to imaginative, Coker is now leading a band of blind people and handcuffs sighted people to them to protect them and send them out for supplies with the so-called good people holding guns on them????? When are film makers going to get it.....bigger is not always better, the story of the original was excellent and bare bones.",1506729600,3,983,4.559322033898305

8443851,3,B004VQRCAK,"This was a good dvd, however it was not a complete movie.  It's only part one of a 2 part mini-series.
There is NO Part 2 available here for purchase. I had to find it on youTube to complete the series.  AMAZON needs to find the second part of this MINI-SERIES and make it available for purchase in REGION 1 DVD Format.  The complete series is available through Amazon, however, it is for other regions besides the USA.",1502928000,11,419,4.346153846153846
