3611123,2,B001GIC5BC,"Very boring for my six year old. Cannot get him to watch it at all. It is just words repeated and shown on the screen. I can do that too with hand written flashcards
and would have saved my money.",1257724800,4,196,3.925
3611124,4,B001GIC5BC,"I was surprised how interesting this DVD is to watch.  It is much more effective than flashcards.  My 7 year old won't choose it for himself, but does watch it when I put it on.  There are 11 word lists on 2 DVD's.  The first DVD has 6 lists that cover sight words from Pre-K to Grade 1.  The second DVD begins at Grade 1 words and ends at Grade 3 level words.  More cost effective than buying 200+ sight word flashcards.",1249948800,13,421,4.073170731707317
3611125,5,B001GIC5BC,The colors and graphics are eye catching so children stay engaged! What a unique way to help children learn to read! I have shown it to Kindergarten age students at my school.,1235520000,9,175,4.5
8305390,3,B001GIC5BC,"Well, I had high hopes but it doesn't quite deliver. We LOVED the preschool prep sight words and went through all 3 and my daughter could identify all the sightwords on their own and even in books. I was looking for more that had the great repetition and could keep her attention. This goes really quick and isn't as engaging for her. I will continue to use it. Maybe it will get better because one way or another, she needs to learn the words. But for the last few days, it just hasn't been as effective.",1459382400,,505,4.270833333333333
8305391,5,B001GIC5BC,"I bought this DVD set as a birthday gift for my great nephew.  I had used this same set along with other learning tools with my daughter long before she started public school.  As I worked with my daughter, the set held her attention.  I had started teaching my daughter sight words before she had started talking (other than baby talk), and this set helped build upon her skills.",1431648000,,380,4.478260869565218
8305392,5,B001GIC5BC,"Good product, fast shipping, would order again",1422230400,,46,5.714285714285714
8305393,5,B001GIC5BC,"my child learned the first DVD in 2 weeks and was reading full sentences just after that...granted I was teaching her all along, the final step for us was the sight words DVD",1401494400,,174,4.303030303030303
8305394,5,B001GIC5BC,"This really makes it easy for my child to remember the sight words. It keeps him interested, not boring at all.  I love it!",1395100800,,123,4.125
8305395,2,B001GIC5BC,"My daughter, who is 2 just finished learning all the words on Meet the Sight Words 1,2 and 3, so I wanted to find a movie for her to learn the rest of the 220 words.  I watch the movies with her and repeat the words for her and she is catching on to them and learning to spell them, which is a plus.  The downside to the movie is that there are only 181 of the 220 words on both dvd's, not the 220 as advertised!!!!  I was VERY disappointed in this finding, so I will have to teach her the other 39 words from flashcards alone.",1316822400,,527,3.861111111111111
8305396,1,B001GIC5BC,"I have tried on several occasions to get my 4 and 6 year old to watch this and every time, they beg me to turn it off. It looks like it was created in PowerPoint. A baby might sit and watch the bright colors and shapes (like Baby Einstein), but I wouldn't count on this (or any) DVD teaching your baby to read. If you are buying this for a pre-reader or kindergartener, look elsewhere. I just ordered ""Meet the Sight Words"" because I've heard it's a much better way to present the sight words in DVD form. And I agree with the reviewer who recommended the Leap Frog Letter Factory & Talking Words Factory DVDs. They are awesome and my 4 year old has known all his letters and sounds since he was 2 because of them!",1304467200,7,714,4.181159420289855
8305397,2,B001GIC5BC,"I am not very impressed.  My daughter is 4, she knows about 50 sight words and is reading some books.  I got this dvd to help her increase the amount of sight words she knows.  I love the concept of the video (repetition, repetition, repetition) but, the teenage looking kids in the ""get up and dance"" portion of the video that are bumping and grinding are a total turn off.  My child and I would have appreciated real children for that part (although there is a random little girl that is shown throughout the dvd.)  I also don't understand the stories at the end of every word list, they go by very fast and just look out of place.  Overall, this video seems as if it is a slide show that my daughter and I put together.  Instead of getting this dvd I should have gotten preschool prep or made one myself.",1294012800,2,807,4.269736842105263
8305398,1,B001GIC5BC,"very boring...

my children even cried to stop the DVD; they never did that with other dvd.

they repeat samething over and over.",1288396800,,129,4.565217391304348
8305399,3,B001GIC5BC,"My son has mastered ""Sight Words, I,II, & III"" by Preschool Prepco (and he's 3) so I thought this would be similar but with more options.  The graphics are nice and it has an upbeat music BUT this is more for entertainment not learning.  My child picked up a few words but it goes too fast.",1262822400,5,290,4.160714285714286
