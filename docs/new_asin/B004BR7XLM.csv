4320038,5,B004BR7XLM,"Three films in each dvd case, each the 2-disc Ultimate Edition, each of which only recently went for around twenty bucks. And still do here on Amazon.  But these two Sean Connery packages (there are two: Sean Connery 007 Collection Volume I & Volume II) really give the best value for your money.

And they up-convert so well in a blu-ray player, you can barely see a difference between these masters and the blu-rays.  I know, I checked.  Amazing.

Picked mine up at Wal-Mart for $10 each.  I'm sure they'll come down in price here on amazon soon, so watch for it.

Well worth your money !",1327276800,2,590,4.457943925233645

4320040,5,B004BR7XLM,This is a great set. There is a feature DVD and a Bonus DVD on each of the three movies. The movies were all made in the 60's so once you get past that level of technology and views of heroes and spies from that era these are some great stories.,1322870400,3,245,3.823529411764706
4320041,5,B004BR7XLM,I purchased this DVD from Amazon and am quite happy that I did so.  The DVD has three Sean Connery movies.,1319328000,,106,4.0476190476190474
4320042,5,B004BR7XLM,"Perfect collection of the first 3 Bond films from the legendary producer Mr. Albert Broccoli - Dr. No, From Russia With Love, and Goldfinger, each on a separate DVD plus an individual special features DVD for each film.  That's 6 DVDs for the 3 films.  Sound is magnificent and the video quality superb.  Anything of lesser quality would make owning a Sean Connery set not worth it.  And who comes to mind when you think of classic James Bond?  Sean Connery first and maybe Roger Moore.  No one else comes close.  The only thing else you need to know is that the prices are lower at Wal-Mart, if you can find it.  Ok Goldfinger, did you want me to talk?  No Mr. Bond, I want you to die!",1318723200,,686,4.296875
4320043,4,B004BR7XLM,"Just checking to see if this collection really contains the widescreen, 2-disc versions of each film? I saw this at a store for $10 brand new, but thought it might be the pan-and-scan versions of the films.",1317772800,5,206,4.594594594594595
4320044,5,B004BR7XLM,"Back in the 1960's when I was a young film buff and James Bond fanatic, you could not legally own a movie, except for those excerpts of about 12 minutes in length produced by companies like Castle Films whose selections were pretty good, but primarily limited to films from the '30s and '40s. Bond movies were never available in that format, and until 1964's ""Goldfinger"" made its world television premiere on The ABC Sunday Night Movie in September 1972, the only way to see 007 was in the theater when the films were re-released in double feature packages. Even now, more than 30 years after the home video revolution, I'm amazed that I can now own these movies. It's far more mind-boggling than anything to come out of Q's laboratory. This particular set, collecting the first three Bond films starring Sean Connery, is a steal.

""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia With Love,"" and ""Goldfinger"" are all presented in beautifully remastered editions. The movies are a bargain at this price, but you get even more: each movie has an additional disc of special features, the highlight being an excellent documentary by John Cork that takes you ""Inside"" the film in question. These docs are worth the price on their own and give you the history of each film from pre-production to release. There are also trailers, including those for the various reissues, TV spots, documentaries made while the films were in production, and poster galleries. At this price - six discs for only 20 bucks - you simply can't beat it.

4320045,5,B004BR7XLM,"How can you go wrong with the original James Bond?  This is a collection of the finest beginning movies that Sean Connery did. Dr. No, From Russia,with Love and Goldfinger.  I bought this to add to my already existing collection so that I could watch these movies when I'm feeling nostalgic.  Most of the time I am feeling this way because now I am retired, living alone and need the diversion of some really great entertainment. You won't go wrong ordering this DVD Movie collection.",1306800000,38,484,4.670588235294118
4320046,5,B004BR7XLM,"Undeniably, though some will argue the point, Sean Connery is the best Bond of all time. Countless polls continue to rank him as number one! He was the orginator of the role when the late Albert Brocolli & his then partner, the late Harry Saltzman started producing the Bond films almost 50 years ago! How time flies!
This volume set contains in chronological release order Dr. No, From Russia With Love & Goldfinger. It is a 6 disc set which mirrors the ultimate editions which were released on dvd years ago. Therefore, the Special Features should be identical without the inclusion or deletion of any previously released material.
For those of us on a budget this year & must scale down the amount of purchases, this is of great value. Also it gives the potential buyer the option to buy exactly what he or she wishes, without buying every volume scheduled for release.
Highly recommended for any & all Bond fans!",1298678400,42,916,4.695652173913044
4320047,5,B004BR7XLM,"First, the good; there's no Bond like Sean and these transfers are stunning. The color is a little over saturated, but probably true to the Technicolor palette of the early 1960's.  The crisp images with a total lack ""fly specking"" are remarkable.  They advertise these as state of the art restorations and if these first three are any indication, they've broken the code on how to transfer older film onto digital media. Now, the bad news; there's only three films on 6 discs, one for each movie and one for the ""extras"" for each movie.  Additionally, they've cluttered up the intros with a whole batch of adverts and way too many alternates before you get to the start.  However, once the opening credits end you're transported back to a pre Vietnam 1962 where everybody assumed spies traveled the world knocking off bad guys and no one gave a whit about any perceived moral implications. I might add in defense of the ""intro"" extravaganza that the 1960's were the film birthing of the iconic opening credits for a great many films; the  Pink Panther* series is cited as just one example.

The first two Bond films weren't considered campy by the standards of the day and many people assumed this stuff actually happened. Ian Fleming's first Bond book, ""Casino Royale"", had been out since 1952 and the literary fiction of the day was rife with spy stories of all stripes. But by 1964's ""Goldfinger"" they were off and running on a 6 decade romp that would test the believability of even the most die hard fan.  No matter, the audience loved this stuff and the producer's set out to make each new film as fantastic as possible. The public was conditioned to accept the ""spy superman"" as a cold war hero and found  Fleming's  more restrained literary Bond as credible as one might find one of Scott Turow's lawyerly protagonists today. This set up a certain discontinuity between Fleming's Bond and the screen version. It was widely rumored that Fleming had issues with the film adaptations of his novels but fell ill and the issue became moot when he passed away a short time later.

The three films are ""Dr. No"",  ""From Russia With Love"",  and ""Goldfinger"" which are the first three  MGM movies in chronological order. One can only hope for ""Vol. 2"" to be out shortly starting with the fourth film, ""Thunderball"".  I say hope only because these properties have been subject to more litigation than you can shake a stick at.  In my opinion the first seven are the best of the bunch as the ones that followed attempted to top each previous film to the point of silliness.  Ironically, the best film of the entire series is generally thought to be the 6th, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" released in 1969  with 007 played by unknown George Lazenby. Ian Fleming is frequently misquoted as having once said that ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was his favorite Bond film, which would have been rather difficult since it wasn't produced until 5 years after his death.  What he actually said was that the novel best captured the Bond character as he envisioned him, and that the book was his favorite.  No matter what you may think of George Lazenby vs. Sean Connery, the screenplay is certainly one of the best and relies less on high tech gizmos than any of the others.  While still clearly a Bond film, it has a Hitchcock/Cary Grant feel to it with Diana Rigg playing a suitably Grace Kelley like Bond girl. Sean Connery was let out (or quit depending on who's version you believe) of his contract for that one film as the producers knew he was tiring of the role and wanted to work on another project.  His only other non Bond film during that time had been 1965's critically acclaimed ""The Hill"" along with a couple small guest roles (including a rather good remake of ""Murder on the  Orient Express"" in 1962) and he was anxious to expand his career with more challenging material. Connery reprised his 007 in 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever"", the seventh film in the series, but then severed his ties with the producers for good.  When asked at the time of his departure why he was leaving he famously said he didn't want to become typecast as a comedic actor; an acceptance that the social turmoil of the late 1960's had forever altered the public's simplistic perception of spy craft and that the only way forward was by producing a more bloated pastiche of the original films, which is exactly what producer Albert Broccoli did during the Roger Moore era. Compounding the public's growing skepticism, Michael Caine hit it big in the ""Ipcress File"" shortly after ""Goldfinger"" was released and the public began to turn from Ian Fleming to  new writers such as Len Deighton, Frederick Forsyth, and John Le Carre who brought more perceived realism to the genre.  Fleming died in 1964, the same year ""Goldfinger"" was produced, and although books bearing his name continued to be published, they were ghost written and largely derivative of the earlier novels.  Connery returned for one last go in 1983's ""Never Say Never Again"", but with different producers and somewhat disappointing results.

So, 3 films rather than the first 6, that you might have hoped for given the disc count (the amazon description at the time of the pre-release was totally silent on the content) and sloppy intros and adverts versus visually stunning transfers of the first 3 films in a legendary series still equals 5 stars in my book.... can't wait for volume 2!

*  If you watch Goldfinger closely you'll see another 007/Pink Panther tie in; Burt Kwouk (Clouseau's houseboy, Cato)  plays the totally forgettable Mr. Ling.",1296345600,118,5601,4.7443298969072165

4320143,5,B004BR7XLM,"The impressive Blu-ray transfers truly enhance these 3 Definitive Sean Connery James Bond films. DR. NO, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER are truly definitive and very formative to what started the James Bond phenomenon. The images of these 3 films are incredible. The DR. NO and GOLDFINGER transfers are simply brilliant.

I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country.

These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here.

Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key.

DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond.

But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.

FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is exceptional filmmaking. When compared to other films in the series it stands alone bringing in very few, if any, elements of the fantastic allowing Bond to rely on his own wit and skill for survival to overcome the opposition.

Over the years FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE seems to have been forgotten and gotten lost from the cinema conscious minds of the movie going public and even some Bond fans. I think with the advent 2006's CASINO ROYALE there has be a resurgence to look back at the style of filmmaking found in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. James Bond is that dedicated civil servant who can handle himself in any situation. From a realistic standpoint, I think we can find that in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and in some ways Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is the definitive performance of the entire series.

GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.

The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.

Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.

Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.

Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well-honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.

Perhaps Sean Connery gave his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. In GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension. That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character.

DR. NO, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER may be the three definitive Bond films of the series as may be Sean Connery's performances as James Bond.",1417996800,10,6072,5.021868787276342
4320144,5,B004BR7XLM,"I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country.

These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here.

Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key.

4320286,5,B004BR7XLM,"I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country.

These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here.

Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key.

DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond.

But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.

FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is exceptional filmmaking. When compared to other films in the series it stands alone bringing in very few, if any, elements of the fantastic allowing Bond to rely on his own wit and skill for survival to overcome the opposition.

Over the years FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE seems to have been forgotten and gotten lost from the cinema conscious minds of the movie going public and even some Bond fans. I think with the advent 2006's CASINO ROYALE there has be a resurgence to look back at the style of filmmaking found in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. James Bond is that dedicated civil servant who can handle himself in any situation. From a realistic standpoint, I think we can find that in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and in some ways Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is the definitive performance of the entire series.

GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.

The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.

Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.

Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.

Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well-honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.

Perhaps Sean Connery gave his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. In GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension. That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character.

Each film has its own disc full of extras. The extras are incomparable and are essential for all Bond enthusiasts.",1353024000,2,5708,5.013727560718057

4320289,5,B004BR7XLM,"Well, I must admit that ""Dr. No"" is the weakest of the three, but ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Goldfinger"" may well be classic movies.

Of course, current movie-goers have no idea that these films even exist.  They are all interested in James Bond flick #47, for about 15 nanoseconds.  They have no clue that the whole series was kicked off by one of our greatest actors (Sean Connery), who finally asked to be released from the Bond routine because he felt he had other stuff he could do.  (A hearty ""yes!"" from those who love ""The Name of the Rose!)  But don't trust me...just wander off to IMDB and have a look at his filmography.

While you're there, you might have a peep at the filmography of Robert Shaw, who did an outstanding job in ""From Russia With Love.""

4320291,4,B004BR7XLM,"I don't usually review DVD sets, but thought I'd mention a few things. First off, yes, you're getting the 2-disc Ultimate Edition version of each movie, which is great. The arrangement is a little strange though, with the first and last discs snapped to the front and back of the case (respectively) and the rest in a hinged flipper thing in the middle. I find that to fully reattach the first and last discs, I have to press on the outside of the case, which tends to leave a mark on the outer sleeve. Finally, there's no booklet included, so you won't know what the chapters are or what's on each disc until you pop them in.

Don't let this dissuade you from buying these sets. This is the first (possibly only) time you'll be able to get the Connery Bond movies by themselves, in attractive packaging to boot. And the transfers are amazing!",1331337600,15,843,4.474025974025974
