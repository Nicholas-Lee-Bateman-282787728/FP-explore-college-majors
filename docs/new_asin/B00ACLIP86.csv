8550014,3,B00ACLIP86,"Two half-brothers meet for the first time and begin a journey to attend their father's funeral. Along the way they have various encounters, including that of a woman one of the brothers kept seeing in his dreams, as well as their dead father. There is some nice imagery that comes from a story by the older brother concerning a man who sweats flowers. But overall, the reward for watching this movie is rather meager. 3 stars",1476748800,,425,4.605263157894737
8550015,5,B00ACLIP86,"Two brothers, Miguel and Nero, are on their way to a funeral - that of their father. He was a bit of a `gad about town' and travelled the World living and loving as he pleased. On his death bed he knew he had not been exactly father of the year and so wrote to his two sons asking if they would attend his last showing on earth - he figured if he could not have given them a father they might like to get a brother instead.

They meet for the first time at a disused railway station somewhere in the middle of Spain. From there they travel across country to the funeral. Along the way they meet an assortment of characters who help to tell the story and give the brothers time to get to know each other. We also have dream sequences and talking to ghosts road bandits and it all seems perfectly natural.

Nero is one of life's fun people; he is full of positive energy and an exuberance that his newly found brother finds irritating - at best. As the journey unfolds they find they have more in common than just a wayward father.

This film has echoes of Luis Buuel and Emir Kusturica - the music and the general bonkers nature of things are just brilliant. The language is poetic and the scenes are all filmed in such a way as to make even the most empty landscape seem bursting with vitality. It is performed in chapters and one caught my imagination as an alternative title; `the wise words of a thief and the reality of dreams'. This was written and directed as a debut by Jonathan Cenzual Burley and he also narrates and appears as a thief in the film; I can't wait to see more from him - this is one of those films that you feel better for having seen.",1421280000,3,1658,4.191222570532916
