7952585,4,B00005RRJD,"This is a real quirky film, and reminds me a lot of films from the early to mid 1970's.  The type that were atmospheric and bizarre, but had subtle touches and a lot of restraint which made them mysterious.",1091145600,5,206,4.282051282051282
7952586,1,B00005RRJD,"This movie is lame, slow, boring, low budget and a sad, sad pathetic excuse for a film.  This doesn't even deserve one star, there is probably as much as 20 words spoken in this movie and that includes the '12, 15' for when the tailors are guessing the waist, hips, etc sizes.  I was truly shocked when I saw that this had more than 1 star for the average reviews.  Half of this movie is zoomed in on the main characters face while he slowly goes crazy, taking all of us with him.  If this movie gets more than 1 star from you ... you really need to expand your movie collection.",1089676800,,579,4.142857142857143
7952587,4,B00005RRJD,"This film made me wonder about all the crazy things going on in the backrooms of shops.  The tailor guy is totally wacky. I thought the film had a cool, subdued mood and well-crafted, surprisingly so at the end.  There were some parts that were a bit eccentric, but the maniac tailor is eccentric too.  It pulled me into a weird place and time.",1046995200,,344,4.34375
7952588,4,B00005RRJD,"a different kind of thriller.  creepy, eerie, takes it's time, a European-like horror film.  if you're looking for cheap horror, this is not it.  it's atmospheric & bizarre.  effective, fairly scary portrayal of how things disintegrate little by little into meaninglessness and paranoia when someone is insane. Recommended.",1017014400,3,323,5.666666666666667
7952589,1,B00005RRJD,"while one can appreciate the extremely creepy setting and stylishly dark direction,I found that the story had little to offer,more like nothing,actually. The film is about two taylor siblings reunited,which sets one of them onto a derranged homocidal journey. The acting is so-so,the dialogue is non-existent and the movie itself is bleak,drab and lifeless. I haven't found it scary or even spooky,occasionaly it gets mildly creepy,but that alone is nowhere near enough to compensate for 90 or so wasted minutes of your life.",1016668800,,525,5.337349397590361
7952590,5,B00005RRJD,"This is a great movie! No gore, but it gives you nightmares and all your shopping after seeing it,will be in big departement stores! The two directors are really great and seem to have a wild imagination. It is perfectly directed and acted. Waiting to see their next movie!",1014595200,,273,4.591836734693878
7952591,5,B00005RRJD,"If you like cinematic films with a Hitchcockian flavor or old Polanski thrillers, this might be a film for you. It personally left me in shivers. It's not a gore or exploitation flick - rather, it takes its time , little by little, into the world of the deranged young tailor - until you don't know which way is out! It's more about psychological deterioration, like the feeling you get when you haven't slept for many days and you start seeing things, imagining horrors, or getting paranoid. Everything seems suspicious, odd or dangerous. The atmosphere is unnerving. The final ballroom scene fascinated me with the outrageous dancers and leering old tailors. I would definitely recommend this thriller to anyone interested in bizarre or creepy films.",1007596800,,752,5.024
