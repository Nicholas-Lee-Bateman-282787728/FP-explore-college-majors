1940952,5,B0000SX9MS,"I had never heard of this movie when my husband rented it on DVD - and it is such a marvelous treasure. It's a luminous coming-of-age story about an English child/girl/woman (Ramola Garai) who lives with her father (Bill Nighy), a successful author suffering prolonged writer's block, gorgeous slightly older sister, bohemian arty stepmother (Tara Fitzgerald), and bespectacled young brother. They move to a cold, drafty, leaky, romantic and picturesque castle in the middle of nowhere, fall behind on the rent, wear an odd shade of green that resulted when the arty and lovely stepmom dyed damn near everything one day.
Rose, the older sister, yearns for wealth. The property on which they live is owned by two brothers who come to inspect things - and that's where the real story begins. Narrated through the POV of Cassandra (Garai), the movie turns into an utterly engaging, wise and wonderful coming-of-age tale of hopes, dreams, plots and counterplots, dashed yearnings, and a painful journey toward adulthood. Hilarious and bittersweet at the same time. Absolutely first-rate performances by the entire cast in a film which ends with the realistic but still hopeful line in `words of one syllable': I love. I have loved. I will love.
I LOVED THIS MOVIE.",1072656000,132,1260,5.0625
1940953,4,B0000SX9MS,"17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain (Romola Garai) lives with her eccentric father (Bill Nighy) and stepmother (Tara Fitzgerald), her older sister Rose (Rose Byrne), and younger brother in run-down castle in the English countryside. Her father is a struggling writer who is unable to reproduce the success of his first book, and, without an income, the family is plunged into poverty. When the old castle's owner dies, his nephews from America, Simon (Henry Thomas) and Neil (Marc Blucas), inherit the property and the neighboring estate. Rose sees the presence of these eligible bachelors as the opportunity of a lifetime to marry well, escape the countryside, and provide means for her family. But Cassandra and Rose's upbringing in isolation among idiosyncratic relatives may be an impediment as the young women find that they lack the understanding of society that would help them find husbands and love.

""I Capture the Castle"" is based on the popular novel of the same name by Dodie Smith. It is basically a soap opera set in rural England of the 1930s. Poor young ladies meet rich eligible men and fall in love. But who will marry whom, and will they marry for love or money? But it is a charming soap opera -only slightly sappy- with an appealing conglomeration of attractive and eccentric characters. Cassandra, who narrates the story, is its flawed heroine, who tries her best to hold her family together and sort out everyone's problems. I'm not sure she acts like a 17-year-old. She is, by her own admission, ""self-consciously naive"". But I think the book and the film are aimed at a younger audience, so Cassandra is in many ways more like them. The film does have one unfortunate characteristic of a soap opera in that it eventually gives the impression of repeating itself. Nevertheless, it is a light-hearted entertaining story told through the occasionally melodramatic experiences of a reluctantly romantic young woman. Henry Thomas gives a nice convincing and sympathetic performance. Recommended, especially for 9-13 year old girls.

Those who are familiar with the book may wonder why this movie is rated R, since the book is a favorite among pre-teen girls. It is rated R for nudity of the topless variety in one scene. It shouldn't be. Topaz, Cassandra's stepmother, is a bit of a nudist. Since brief topless nudity is permitted in the PG-13 rating, I have to say that this film was rated incorrectly. Without that scene, a PG rating would be appropriate. And that is what it received in most parts of the world. The DVD contains both full and wide screen versions of the film.",1072310400,7,2595,4.9495412844036695
1940954,5,B0000SX9MS,"After seeing one of my favourite actors was in this movie I decided to read the book.  The book is one of my favourites now, with the movie only being shown in one theatre downtown, my best friend and I made the trek taking subway, bus, and walking to find it.  When we arrived we sat down in this very rundown theatre, our expectations were not high.  The movie amazed us, the plot, dialogue, and actors were all incredible, I advise you see this movie or purchase as soon as you can.",1070841600,3,485,4.25
1940955,5,B0000SX9MS,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I had to DRAG my mother to see this movie with me, but she wound up laughing harder than I did!  This is a beautiful film set in the 40's English countryside.  It's a coming of age story (based on the novel by Dodie Smith) about a girl and her family, poverty, society and best of all first love.  The cinematography is gorgeous and the set of the castle is exactly the way I pictured it.  It's definately what you would call a ""dramedy"" with just the right mix of subtle (mostly - except perhaps for the bear joke) humor and the dose of pain you would feel if your experience with first love turned into a bitter family situation.  This is a touching film and allows you to really feel as though you want to help the characters and offer them a shoulder to cry on.  Trust me, it's worth a couple hours of your time!  Plus, Marc Blucas is a total hottie! *smile*",1067040000,,900,4.167630057803469
1940956,4,B0000SX9MS,"I loved the clothes in this film and the way they could make it all seem like dress up. The style of the film was imaginative. The moat with the lily pads floating, I could almost feel the cold of the water. The castle even though it seemed like it could be cold it was warm in a cozy way with all the art of creative people living in it. I would love to stay in a castle like that where life could be created just like out of a story. Rites of passage held in the woods with a fire burning and wild dances. Flowing clothes and long hair flying out wildly. I want to go to Sherwood Forrest and see all the bluebells. The girl was romantic and wistful. Good Film- definately must go to the country in England after watching this film! Victorian Style want more of this in my life, its quite missing where I live. Creative Style with clothes, hair, etc. But all done without conformity and imaginative flair!!",1062201600,10,907,4.218390804597701
1940957,5,B0000SX9MS,"This is one of the most perfect films to come out of Britain in the last few years. Centred by a glowing performance by the lovely Romola Garai, it is packed with wondrous actors perfectly suited to their roles. Advertising and critics would lead you to believe this is a light nostalgic memento of the 30's, but it is a coming of age film so mature it lays disgrace on American versions of this genre. Beautifully shot,marvellously directed, exquisitely designed,and lovingly scored, it is an absolute must see for all who love film, emotional maturity, and the generosity of family...and for those who find pleasure just at looking at physically beautiful people. I am in love with them all.",1059091200,,693,4.831932773109243

1940970,3,B0000SX9MS,"If you're looking for something to do, this will pass the time. It's not deep like Thackaray, Austen, or Bronte, but it's visually pretty. I always enjoy Tara Fitzgerald and Bill Nighy. They do a good job, but the stand outs are Henry Cavill and Sinead Cusack. Cavill just embodied the love sick, sincere youth. Cusack looked completely different from anything I've ever seen her in. Most Brits play really exaggerated Americans and get the accent all wrong. They don't look at all natural and tend to be one dimensional- regardless of the writing. I had to do a double take with Cusack's performance. After a while, I just forgot who she was and went with it. She was so natural. Nighy has the best scene with his daughter in the tower, but it's not really worth it to get that far into the story. It's rather disappointing.

If you want to see some good moments in acting and pretty scenery, give it a go. Otherwise there are many better choices.",1505606400,,948,4.543859649122807

1941002,4,B0000SX9MS,"Have never before written one of these!  This was a surprisingly good story.  Most of the characters were well developed and the plot was somewhat unpredictable. It was quirky at times. There were some life lessons neatly tied in.  The only thing that bugged me was that the details of the life of the little brother was left out, and he was clearly really intelligent and funny. I wanted to understand him better!  All the other members of the family had depth and direction.  Will watch again!",1500854400,,495,4.64367816091954
1941003,5,B0000SX9MS,"This film is based upon a book of the same name, written by the author of ""A 101 Dalmations"", Dodie Smith, and  published in 1948. Not having yet read the book, I can offer no comparison. All, I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed this beautifully nuanced, well-acted film. Set in the nineteen thirties, it is essentially a coming of age film.

The down,  but not out,  Mortmain family lives in a rundown, decaying castle somewhere in the English countryside. The family consists of two sisters,  seventeen year old Cassandra and her beautiful,  older sister, Rose, their younger brother, and their  father and step-mother. Mr. Mortmain is a famous writer who had published a book twelve years prior to much acclaim, but who has since been suffering from writer's block ever since. The step-mother is an artist. Needless to say, the family is impoverished, living a solitary, hardscrabble life. Living with them is a local village lad who helps them with the day to day chores and has a crush on Cassandra. Everything changes, however,  when the owner of a neighboring estate dies, and two brothers, Americans Neil and Simon Cotton inherit and move in. Suddenly, the Mortmains find themselves being social,  and nothing is ever the same.

The production values and cinematography for this BBC film are outstanding. Romola Garai gives a beautiful, sensitive performance as Cassandra. Bill Nighy is terrific as Mr. Mortmain,  the tortured writer. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent in their respective roles. The film held me in its thrall from beginning to end.  I loved it. I now look forward to reading the book upon which this film is based.",1500595200,5,1653,4.885304659498208
1941004,1,B0000SX9MS,I foolishly kept watching in the hopes that it might get better but it didn't. I will never get back the time I wasted watching this movie. Almost all of the characters were unlikable. Every family member couldn't think of anyone but themselves and the older sister was a gold digger and a poser. The love interests were also horrible as the family.,1500422400,,349,4.555555555555555
1941005,5,B0000SX9MS,"This is a heart-wrenching story of, to quote Thoreau, ""the complicated webs we weave..."".  Two sisters, 4 love stories, some happy, some sad.

1941026,2,B0000SX9MS,"I know the book is very nearly always better than the movie but this movie is horrible. The book is lovely, full of wacky and loveable characters, bewitching language, and humor. None of that was captured in the screenplay. The story is hurried, the subtleties have been made obvious, and everything that was cute and offbeat in the book becomes weird and off putting in the movie. The lovely characters are whiny and harsh. The cast is stellar (which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one), so it could have been a great movie, but the screenplay is rubbish. Read the book, laugh, and enjoy. Don't ruin the experience by watching this movie.",1496793600,,656,4.567796610169491
1941027,3,B0000SX9MS,"I decided to watch this for the clothing. I love costume dramas. But, this wasn't the light, frothy confection I thought it was going to be. It's really rather sad. I felt the frustration and longing of the two oldest girls, trapped in poverty and barred from living a better life because their father was too blocked to write and too selfish to do something else or get professional help. One can't blame Cassandra for never wanting to fall in love when one sees what love did to her mother. The cast was good and the settings were lovely. It's just not an uplifting movie, by my standards.",1495929600,2,591,4.481481481481482

Like a pair of Jane Austen heroines in wearing the clothing from ""Downton Abbey.""  At times, it was a comedy and I found myself laughing hysterically, while at other times the story was a very sober look at the perils of long-term relationships.

I enjoyed the film immensely, though perhaps the sad/serious stuff is what's keeping me from giving this a 5-star rating; once the comedic bits ended, I was wishing the whole film had been more comedy, because I liked how uplifting the happy moments were, and they were done quite well. But overall, it was good and I'd watch it again.",1495670400,,692,4.710743801652892

This story tempered my life's loves and I think all teens should read this for a glimmer of understanding their feelings and choices in life. I really liked the 2003 movie adaptation but as usual, the movie was different than what I remembered reading. Then a couple of years ago I realized Henry Cavill (aka ""Man of Steel"") played Stephen and all the more reason I thought Cassandra was crazy.

1941170,4,B0000SX9MS,"Surprisingly good, deep and rich story, character study of an eccentric family. The old ramshackle castle is a character on it's own. It's not only a coming of age story, the discovery by very bright but naive isolated girls of love, but also one of redemption for the father played rather well by Bill Nighy. It's a period piece set in the '30s and the clothing, sets and atmosphere were wonderful. They endure a major loss and there's an aura of depression in the Castle. Romola Garai held the lead here very well, and you can see why she got cast in Emma later on. There's plenty of character study to go around, all the characters had depth and were very real trying to find there way through difficult times. The writing is first rate which is very good since the father was an author and the daughter's writing in her diary is the source of the story. Love, failure to express love, people falling for and loving those who love someone else, it's all there.  I Capture the Castle captured my heart.",1485129600,4,1004,4.4863387978142075

The family father is famous for a book he wrote 12 years ago; seeking for inspiration and hoping to write something else, he brings the family to an abandoned castle to live.  Unfortunately there is little money and the family tries to muddle along, believing their father can pull another book out of the proverbial hat.  In the meantime, a new family arrives on the scene from America - the new owners of the lands and castle.  The oldest daughter is determined to rise out of the poverty they have been living in and sets her cap for one of the American sons.  The next daughter in line hates her sister's machinations.  Love is fickle, however, and everything turns out strangely in the end, yet with a certain satisfaction.

1941768,4,B0000SX9MS,"This movie is based on a popular and well-liked novel. I have not read the novel so I will base my essay only on the movie. A note should be made at the outset that the cinematography and costuming are outstanding. Acting and directing support the script well.
This is a chick flick and spoiler alert. The story takes place in the 1930s in the English countryside near London. The main protagonists are two late teenage sisters, Rose and Cassandra Mortmain. The family has rented a small run down castle. Their father is an unsuccessful novelist having a difficult time producing a quality product. Rose and Cassandra are coming of age, and are aware of the familys financial difficulties. Two handsome well-to-do young American men, Neil and Simon Cotton, come into possession of the castle, and develop a relationship with the girls, who now recognize an opportunity for their escape from misfortune. Triangular complications follow.
Rose, the older sister, is determined to leave the depressing environment of the castle by marrying Simon. Both Cotton boys were taken with Rose, with Cassandra ceding the task of catching him to Rose. Simon falls in love with Rose, who is not in love with him. Cassandra is in heart-breakingly love with Simon, but realizes he is off limits. Rose, focusing on the thrill of the chase, and in an apparent burst of adolescent lust, marries Neil whom she does not love.
Cassandras long-time friend, Stephen, son of the familys maid when they had one, is madly in love with Cassandra. She tells him that she doesnt love him. He asks her to marry him, she refuses, reaffirming that she does not love him. He is heart-broken.
To me this is the heart of the story and raises the issue of Cassandras strong character. Given that Cassandra and Rose were brought up in the same environment, what accounts for her foresight to want to marry for love, while Rose jumps at the opportunity to marry for money without love? Sounds silly but in light of current mores, Cassandra is an outlier. [Pun].",1478217600,,2021,4.810344827586207

1941826,4,B0000SX9MS,"This was interesting as it delved into human character. The madness of a writer who allowed circumstances to dictate his gift or ability to write. Each child had different responses to their upbringing and sought after life in their own way. I saw that one cannot blame circumstances, but take responsibility and encourage others to do the same in order to be useful and impact the lives of those one is in contact. This was a good movie.

I like it enough to have watched it twice, primarily because the good, kind characters outweigh the shallow. Not a spoiler, and perhaps unkind, but I believe Rose and Simon deserved each other. Even when I was young, I knew the difference between love and being in love, the latter being tenuous and perhaps fleeting. I also know this doesn't reduce the pain of not having what the heart wants.

Mostly because the main character reminded me of me when I was a teenager: introspective, curious, sensitive, on the cusp of adulthood... wanting to experience the world but hopelessly naive and confused!  I imagine many young viewers probably empathize with her.  I was so relieved that nothing really horrible happens to her in the end, other than a little heartbreak, which is a necessary part of growing up.",1475539200,,447,5.027027027027027

1942202,4,B0000SX9MS,"Yes, the movie loses some of the charm and voice of the amazing book, but it's a very faithful almost page for page adaptation.  LOVE the castle and the feel of the countryside. Loses a star for some strange casting, i.e. as much as I love ET, Henry Thomas is just not as appealing as a grown up. Romola is ok, but does feel a little 'consciously naive.'  Rose's coloring doesn't look right with her red hair. The best casting, I think, was a young Henry Cavill as Stephen. Very ingenuous, handsome, and natural, ""all the Greek gods rolled into one.""",1475452800,2,550,4.435643564356436

The step mom is a character you can't help but like; she's a little quirky but very like able and kindhearted. The movie focus on the relationship of sisters and the deadbeat father. When one of lower class gets engaged to one of a higher class, the plot thickens. The grandeur of the roaring twenties is portray is clothing, clubs, parties, and the social atmosphere of sobery. But steadfast family dedication remains with one family, wealth or no wealth. In the end, situations turn for the better, but one sister is left to ""love"".

1942500,5,B0000SX9MS,"This is such a clever, witty and tender storyline. 2 very bright children, and one pretty wacky one, are charmed by their father to move to or perhaps hide out with him in the Enlish countryside.  He is a once lauded author, now released felon, who has been unable to write.  They take up residence in a dilapidated castle, where he is certain his literary talents will be renewed. Also part of the family, is the fathers's second wife, a self-proclaimed artist, who thinks nothing of dying everyone's clothes a shade of green which seems to speak to her. A serious aspect is that the children are subjected to considerable poverty and neglect (little food) while there's no income, but even these hardships are pretty successfully navigated by the 2 daughters. The tender part is each member's getting in touch with emotions and affection, and expressing those. Cassandra, the 17 year old daughter, is the narrator and the most gifted of writers, as is reflected in the eloquent recounting of the story and the unfolding of her journals. The romantic fantasizing and adventures of the 2 girls present them as aiming for sophistication but struggling with big doses of navet. The story is elegantly, cleverly and fluidly written. The acting is first-rate, as are all the filmmaking disciplines. It's great!",1473206400,25,1306,4.931818181818182

1942521,4,B0000SX9MS,"Four POIGNANT Stars. Centered in and around England of the 1930s, ""I Capture The Castle"" tells the story of the trials and tribulations of the Mortmain family, seen mostly through the eyes of teenaged Cassandra who keeps a diligent daily diary that is a device to reveal her thoughts to the audience. The family patriarch is a fading writer with no new books for over a decade who lives in a rundown castle with his family and second wife. They are deep in debt and living off meager resources when a ray of light appears, out of a rainstorm, in the person of the castle's true owner who greatly affects their future. The very talented acting ensemble is fabulous in its execution of this dramatic and romantic coming of age and 'adult travails' story with a deep undercurrent. There are touching, funny, sad, self-sacrificing, and hopeful moments, rushing towards an unexpected ending. Starring Romola Garai as Cassandra, Rose Bryne, Bill Nighy, Henry Cavill, Tara Fitzgerald, Henry Thomas, Sophie Stuckey, and Marc Blucas. Directed by Tim Fywell. Based on the novel by Dodie Smith.

1942734,3,B0000SX9MS,"This is a charming little coming of age story.  It's sweet and seemingly substantive, but ultimately empty, much like the older sister.  The costumes are great, and the pinching poverty of the pretentious, literati parents is comic but felt.  Rose's frothy pink dress for the dinner party was like something out of a Hieronymus Bosch meets Salvador Dali painting.  They frequently don't have enough to eat and therefore try far too hard to keep up an artistic appearance.

Characters evolve and learn things along the way.  There is lovely scenery.  The movie makes me want to wear a pair of stockings and sturdy shoes with a cotton dress and stand on a rocky seashore. Things work out in the end. They work out crooked, but they work out.  But ultimately there's not enough meat on the table.  The sweetness of the film fails to satisfy.  The lessons learned feel a little too universal, a little borrowed and put on.  I would have loved this film when I was 12 or so, but for an adult there's not enough to chew on.  It's more of a young adult movie really.

I understand this film is based on a much-loved book, and that the book must have been better than the movie. The challenges are probably more authentically overcome and the lessons more genuinely hard won in the book.  I'll give the book a chance if I ever come across it, but I probably won't watch the movie again unless I need to entertain my nieces without worrying their parents. They will probably feel they've watched a very grown up film, even though nothing offensive ever really happens.",1470441600,7,1559,4.601449275362318

Gorgeous scenery, well done screen play, and the wonderful Bill Nighy. This is a British film, some people might find the pacing slow, but this gives time for the story to unfold. It's a gentle tale, set in 1936, told from the point of view of Cassandra, the 17 year old second daughter, who is teaching herself to write, to ""capture the castle"", by keeping a journal.

1942780,5,B0000SX9MS,"I Capture The Castle is one of my favorite coming of age novels, the movie while not completely flawless and 100% accurate to the book is in my opinion nonetheless wonderfully acted by Romola Garai as the narrator Cassandra, Bill Nighy as her father; once a celebrated author but who for years has been suffering writer's block and is seemingly oblivious to how low the family's fortunes have fallen. Rounding out the supporting cast are Sinead Cusack, Tara Fitzgerald, Rose Byrne, Marc Blucas, Henry Thomas. The film also includes a rather sweet performance by future Superman Henry Cavill as Cassandra's extremely handsome lovelorn suitor Stephen. The cinematography is exquisite as well. This is one of my favorite British period dramas even if to some it feels like a soap opera. I've enjoyed this movie so much over the years that I bought a new DVD a few months ago to be prepared in case my previous one wears out due to the constant re-watches and friends borrowing it over the years. I was sad to see it be out of print but fortunately I ordered from a great seller. The disc was a Canadian release that was promptly delivered by amazon according to schedule, my only minor complaint is that the disc didn't contain the deleted scenes that were advertised on the page but overall that didn't deter my enjoyment of the movie that to quote the movie version of Cassandra Mortmain I love. I have loved and I most definitely will continue to love for years to come.",1341532800,2,1470,4.67953667953668
1942781,4,B0000SX9MS,"The tale, originally written in book form by British author Dodie Smith, is a classic. The movie unfortunately doesn't start with the famous first line of her book that is often quoted, ""I write this sitting in the kitchen sink."" Nevertheless, it does start with Cassandra Mortmain, who narrates the tale in literature as well as her character on screen.

Cassandra, played by Romola, is the daughter of James Mortmain (Bill Nighy), who is an author. The man wrote one bestseller twelve years ago and hasn't had the ability to write a word since. During the heyday of his popularity, he rented a castle, thinking it would be the perfect place to write his next novel. Unfortunately, the inspiration never arrived.

Cassandra has two siblings, Rose (Rose Byrne) and Thomas. They have a helper around the house, by the name of Stephen Colley, played by a very young and handsome young man - Henry Cavill.

Cassandra loves to write everything in her journal, so as she sits in the sink you soon become aware of the family's appalling state of affairs through her narration. They are broke. The rent hasn't been paid in two years. James's second wife Topaz, is a bit eccentric to say the least, played by Tara Fitzgerald. Everyone is frustrated at father because he won't write and at least attempt to provide for the family since the royalties on his best seller have dwindled to zero.

Then life changes when two American young men inherit the land and hall from their ancestor. Rich, young, and handsome, the pining young beauty Rose, Cassandra's older sister, sets her eyes upon the boys determined to marry wealth and leave the squalor of her life behind. The tale ensues, romance arrives, while the reasons behind Cassandra's broken father are revealed and finally healed. Of course, a few heartbreaking situations occur before everything comes to culmination. It is a great story.

The book is filled with iconic lines, some of which I have absolutely loved, that made their way into the movie.

  ""I said I would never fall in love; I said love was a murderous thing; And it is, and I'm floating on air.""

  ""There is only one page left to write on. I will fill it with words of only one syllable. I love. I have loved. I will love.""

If you're looking for a decent 1930's period story and are not familiar with this particular one, you may enjoy it.",1332720000,,2354,4.686893203883495
1942782,3,B0000SX9MS,"A worthwhile and enjoyable movie that could have been better. The story loses something in translation to film; it is better told and has more humor, subtlety and insight in the book (see my review). Beyond that, there is Bill Nighy, a wonderful actor, who is just not on his game here, despite being appropriately cast. If you see him in this and remember him in ""The Girl in the Cafe"", ""Notes on a Scandal"" and even ""Love, Actually"", you will see the difference. He's good but not as good as this odd and juicy part deserves. Then there's Henry Thomas: maybe my fault rather than his, but I cannot see him in this role.  The rest of the cast is fine and believable, especialy 16 or 17 year old actress Romola Garai. An instantly formidible presence here as in ""Atonement""(woefully under-recognized for that one), ""Emma"" and others.  There are also a couple of quick nightime views of a GP Bugatti, for which I would have added an extra half-star if half-stars were available.",1318723200,,977,4.609195402298851
1942783,5,B0000SX9MS,"I CAPTURE THE CASTLE is an inordinately beautiful film, blessed by a fine script adapted from the successful novel by Dodie Smith, a fine director who knows how to pace a film, beautiful cinematography, and a cast that is impeccable. ""Capturing the castle"" is both a real storyline and a metaphor for the struggle to find the self at the doorstep of maturity. What begins as a fairytale adventure - a small family moves into a real though dilapidated castle after the father is released from custody for wife abuse - becomes a withering fantasy as reality creeps into their lives. Since the mother died the father is unable to continue his successful flow of writing and hopes that living in a castle will open his writer's block. His daughters and son must adapt to the pauper life despite their 'castle', share their dreams, and eventually the light toward escape comes in the form of two American brothers who now own the property on which the castle sits. At this point the story frolics through the romances of the sisters, the addition of a stepmother and the eventual resolution of dreams for one daughter and the comfortable longing for love for the other daughter.

The cast includes the radiant Romola Garai and Rose Byrne as the sisters, Bill Nighy as the blocked writer/father, Tara Fitzgerald (VERY sensitive actress) as the stepmother, Henry Thomas and Marc Blucas as the American brothers, and one Henry Cavill as Stephen - the beautiful Adonis boy who remains in the background and serves only as a sensual propellant to the girl's grounded dreams.

In a field of movies that try very hard to be Oscar contenders, I CAPTURE THE CASTLE seems content to be exactly what it is - a luminously beautiful simple film that will capture your heart. March 11",1300838400,,1765,4.764705882352941

I loved the book, and I can attest that the movie both captures the spirit of the text and brings a further beautiful and intangible something to the tale...Perhaps a more dangerous understanding of how easy it is to be corrupted by money or the desire for love. Certainly the movie offers an additional aching realization of the uncertainty that the young have moving into the moral universe of adults--while still soaring toward a lovely ending.

The acting, directing, and photography are first rate.  It's the story that kills.  There is no humor, most of the characters are nasty or mad, and there are buckets of tears.  The two semi-nude scenes are simply a joke, a blatant attempt to attract an audience.

The review printed on the DVD box calls the film ""Frightfully romantic and terribly funny.""  Both claims are simply ridiculous.  What a waste of time.",1292457600,2,556,4.768421052631579
1942786,4,B0000SX9MS,"An English family moves into a castle, a setting in which the writer/father believes he can write masterpieces.  He doesn't.  Instead he buries his wife and develops writer's block.  His second wife does what she can to nurture the writer's children--a bright, clever young man (cf. the youngest sister, Margaret, in Sense and Sensibility) and two older sisters, both marriageable, one pretty but initially superficial, the other deeper but slightly less attractive.

Enter the inheritor of the castle (the writer's new landlord) and his brother, each of whom might (or might not) be a match for one of the writer's daughters.  The brothers, however, are American, which is to say rich, slightly intimidated by all things British and a bit thick.  When Henry James does the Americans-in-Europe bit it often turns nasty.  When Jane Austen does the marriageable sisters bit it often turns out well.  In I Capture the Castle the two different plot models come together somewhat uneasily.  I should say also that the British actors outshine the American actors to a noticeable degree.

The story is engaging and the younger of the two daughters (whose story this is, ultimately) is sweet, charming and worthy of either Jane Austen or Henry James.

The location shots in Wales and the Isle of Man are very nice.  Recommended for all devotees of British period drama.",1272067200,,1361,5.026785714285714

1942788,5,B0000SX9MS,"This film is splendid: it is a meditation on life, love, and the the intense allure as well as the perils of a life devoted to art. Set in the gorgeous English countryside during the 1930s, the film tells its delicate story with a quiet grace. To summarize the plot briefly: an English family moves to a massive, decaying but impressive castle in the countryside with the hope of encouraging the writer-father (the brilliant Bill Nighy) to finish a second novel. The family is unusual, decidedly Bohemian, and believes in an ideal of Art but suffers bitterly for it, wallowing in poverty. The eldest daughter, played by the beautiful Rose Byrne, desperately longs for a life of luxury and wealth, which is represented by the two attractive American brothers who come to claim the castle as part of their heritage. Rose Byrne as Rose and her younger sister Cassie (played by the excellent, exceptionally talented Romola Garai) become entangled in a difficult, life-changing relationship with the American brothers as the family's fortune ebbs and flows. The film also features gorgeous cinematography as it is filled with breathtaking shots of the countryside (it was filmed on the Isle of Man) and the rambling castle.

I have read the wonderful novel by Dodie Smith, an accomplished English playwright and novelist (who also happened to be the author of The Hundred and One Dalmations, among other works) and I have seen the film several times. The film does not disappoint; in fact, I consider it a lovely and articulate adaptation of the novel. The acting is brilliantly fine: the best performance by far is Bill Nighy's fabulous turn as the crippled (by writer's block) writer who was once hailed as the next great British novelist, a po-mo version of James Joyce. He has been damaged by life and inhibited by the highest of expectations that were unfairly imposed upon him after his debut made a dramatic splash. The story is told through the point of view of Cassie (Garai), who writes compulsively to sort out her emotions and who matures as the film progresses, discovering secrets about herself, her family, and the American brothers that change the lives of everyone involved.",1250640000,2,2186,4.940217391304348

1942790,4,B0000SX9MS,"I have yet to read the novel upon which this movie is based, so I can only comment on the movie itself. I enjoyed it and thought that both the female leads, Romola Garai and Rose Byrne delivered commendable and credible performances.

The story itself is a coming-of-age story set in 1930s England - the movie begins via flashback as a once successful writer [Bill Nighy] moves his family [2 young daughters and a wife] from London to the countryside, taking up residence in an old castle which they lease from the owner. A decade passes and the writer is still struggling to overcome his writer's block - the movie progresses with narration by his younger daughter Cassandra [Romola Garai who also shone in ""Daniel Deronda""], a 17-year-old with a talent for writing. It is Cassandra who makes candid observations about her family, now almost destitute with no income to live on. The family has lost the mother [died], and her place is taken by bohemian stepmother Topaz [Tara Fitzgerald,], an artist and free spirit who likes dancing nude in the rain. Rose [Rose Byrne] is the older sister, beautiful yet troubled, and there is also a much younger sibling, a boy who seems unperturbed by the deprived circumstances the family lives in.

Things change when a pair of brothers come to visit the estate - the older Simon [Henry Thomas] is the heir to the estate and Rose, much aware of the opportunity at hand is determined to become his bride. The younger brother Neil [Marc Blucas, most famous as Riley in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series] thinks both sisters are nothing better than gold diggers. Their mother is portrayed by Sinead Cusack, who is marvellous in her brief role, spouting wry observations in each scene she appears in.

The rest of the drama follows the girls as they get more deeply embroiled in matters of the heart with some predictable outcomes. Both Romola Garai and Rose Byrne share credible chemistry as a pair of siblings who are as different as night and day, yet very much connected to each other. Their performances carry the movie for the most part - though the romantic element is also a major part of the movie, it is the struggles of the sisters that drew me in the most. Though the movie starts off on a light footing, it gets darker as the movie progresses, exploring the characters in depth and adding more substance to an otherwise tepid plot. Various themes get explored, some more convincingly than others, but it kept my interest.

The cinematography perfectly captures the lush beauty of the English countryside and on the whole, I'd recommend this to fans of British period dramas.",1243555200,,2622,4.756043956043956

I Capture the Castle was adapted from what may be the most awkwardly-titled young adult novel of all time, and TV director Tim Fywell's lack of insistence that the godawful title be changed should tip you off that awkwardness comprises a good deal of what you're in for with this exceptionally odd adaptation. First off, why shut out most of your built-in audience by making an R-rated adaptation of a young adult book? Why make it worse with some of the strangest casting decisions in modern filmdom? Why not at least try to whip it into some sort of shape that readers of the book might recognize? Well, to be fair, it's quite possible they did that; that may, in fact, be the source of all the awkwardness. Let the viewer decide.

Cassandra Mortmain (Atonement bombshell Romola Garai) and her odd family-- older sister Rose (28 Weeks Later's Rose Byrne), father James (Pirates of the Caribbean's Bill Nighy), and stepmother Topaz (Brassed Off's Tara Fitzgerald)-- move to a crumbling castle in the country so James, a previously successful writer with a decade-long case of writer's block, can finally start working again. The problem is, it doesn't work, and a couple of years down the road, the family are penniless. Enter the Cotton family, who own the land on which the castle stands. The two brothers, Neil (They's Marc Blukas) and Simon (Deadbirds' Henry Thomas), capture Rose's eye, and she sets her heart on marrying one of them to pull her family out of poverty. Thus begins a melodrama of manners.

And melodrama it is; nary a chance to overnarrate, overact, overdecorate, or overdirect is passed up. Even at less than two hours and being based on a novel, the film is brutally slow-paced. One wonders what swathes of prose got cut to make this screenplay fit to time, and whether all the book's actual action, plot furtherance, and character development was contained in it. (That's actually not a bad guess, as much of what goes wrong with novel adaptations usually has to do with one or more of those three aspects getting cut; it's a rare thing all three fall by the wayside, however.) The sole bright light in all this is Romola Garai's performance. For all I know, she's overacting in every scene, but relative to what's around her, it at least seems understated and heartfelt. Other than that, though, and Tara Fitzgerald's character's propensity to go dancing naked in the dark, I couldn't find a single reason to keep watching this film, save to spare those of you who've never seen it before the same boredom I suffered. *",1199318400,10,2586,4.767857142857143

The family is so very quirky, especially Topaz who is the heart of soul of bohemian, artistic fervor and her little ritual in the rain was funny but when she just had to do it in front of Cassandra it was really funny. Marc Blucas is beautiful but I wasn't impressed with his acting in this...perhaps it was his voice that didn't seem to fit. Romola was an ideal narrator and Henry Thomas perfect for his role. It's a chick flick though guys....if you have some tolerance for chick flicks, you'll enjoy this but otherwise don't bother. I liked the ending too, it wasn't what I was expecting and that's always nice. So, go see for yourselves....why ARE they all wearing green?",1197244800,,807,4.496598639455782
1942796,3,B0000SX9MS,"I first saw this film in the arthouses in 2000 and felt that something was definitely not all together about this story. I remembered it and revisited it after purchasing it on DVD this morning. I still feel the same way. As the main character,Cassandra (a wonderful Romola Garai (AMAZING GRACE and VANITY FAIR) writes in her journal,""It all feels fractured"".It does.

As much as I want to like this film more, the screenplay by Heidi Thomas, whose main claim to fame is television writing,just simply seems so disconnected and lacking in a single purpose and focus. If the film is supposedly Cassandra's story,there then is much missing from the Dodie Smith book to make the story and the characters come alive on screen.

The acting from Romola Garai,Rose Byrne as her sister Rose,Bill Nighy as their writer-blocked father, and Tara Fitzgerald,especially, as Topaz, the odd stepmother, are all uniformly excellent. Henry Thomas and Marc Blucas appear quite awkward in their roles as the American brothers who have come to England as inheritors. Thomas seems particularly miscast and unsuited for this role.

Dario Marianelli,Oscar nominated for his later soundtrack PRIDE AND PREJUDICE does another admirable job at composing a lovely and lyrical score.

But, this film simply falls flat, and much is left to your imagination.

DVD extras contain an interview with Romola Garai which reveals no new insight into the film for me. The deleted scenes are miniscule and could have very easily remained. I thought the alternate ending was a better choice that was not chosen. See what I mean?

But the opportunity to see Rose again after discovering her in the Aussi&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-GODDESS-OF-1967/dp/B000LPS2OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE GODDESS OF 1967</a>, then enthralled by her in the American&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WICKER-PARK/dp/B00067BBMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WICKER PARK</a>, was too much. And what a joy! Here were people who knew how to bring out her angelic beauty. And, doesn't she have the prettiest profile in all Christendom? What amazes me most is that in those 3 films, she created 3 distinct characters. If I hadn't known, I'd never make the connection.

While it was correct to make Rose the prettier sister (she played ""Rose"" -- isn't that a nice coincidence), don't underestimate Romola Garai as the sane and sensible sister with her potent girl-next-door allure. She had to carry the film on her 17 or 18 year-old shoulders (the age of the characer she played -- another nice coincidence). And she did it is with ease.

If you haven't yet, check out the commentary by the director, producer and screenwriter. They are chatty and informative at the same time. However, they were a little disingenuous when they spoke of the American actors, Henry Thomas and Mark Blucas. The producer and director said they were the best American actors they auditioned capable of uttering the ""literary"" dialog. A more honest appraisal would be that they were the best actors they could get to fit within their P-pinching budget. The dialog wasn't that unnatural and there are many young American actors who could have done better. At least, these two managed to show more dimensions than British pretty boy Henry Cavill.

I can't say enuf about the rest of the supporting cast, however. Bill Nighy, Tara Fitzgerald and Joe Sowerbutts as the rest of the family couldn't be better. In a few scenes, Sinead Cusak, as the young mens' mother, renders a perfect accent and wonderful vividness as the blunt American matron.

And let's not forget to include the decaying castle representing the plight of the family. And the 1930s recreations (in costume and setting). All evocatively filmed.

Like other British films with American characters, this could be seen as allegorical, but this presents the culture clash so ambiguously that it doesn't qualify as anti-American. Now, that's different!

Thanks, again. I need to get myself a copy for my DVD library.

I'll give her a break because this is one of her first films, but thank goodness Bill Nighy carried the rest of the scene. The funny thing is when you listen to Romola during her interview in the special features, you think ""Why couldn't we get this part of you in the film""?  She's an intelligent and witty woman, but her performance as the lead character was just underwhelming. That's a horrible shame.  The lead always sets the tone for the film.

Why did the director feel it necessary to tell what is essentially a chocolate-chomping girl's heartbreak with nudity and graphic groping?  Teens love their romance, boy-girl breakups, and crush's.  This media world of overt-sexuality and easy porn - come on --- let the kids have their childhood.

Oh, how many young sis' have coveted their older sister's boyfriends.  All of them! And that sexual awakening thing is happening at breakneck speed, but in 60 percent of American girls - the actual event begins with marriage. In this film marriage is not portrayed as something folks do for love: the sisters want to marry up at any cost.  Is that a good lesson for teen gals?

Perhaps I'm not being fair on the philosophical side, but how about a believable story we can care about?  You won't find it in I Capture the Castle.  You'll instead discover your first yawn developing about ten minutes into the production as the eccentric wife does her nude scene, the eccentric writer does his prison scene, the girls do their not enough to eat in this romantic castle scene, and suddenly the guys show up like Price Charmings out of nowhere like we haven't seen that one before.

1942804,4,B0000SX9MS,"As this coming-of-age drama opens, best-selling author James (Bill Nighy) sees a crumbling old castle and immediately falls in love with it.  Thinking it the perfect place to write his sequel, he moves his family into it.  Twelve years later, he hasn't been able to write a word and the family is penniless.  Daughters Rose (Rose Byrne) and Cassandra (Romola Garai) hate living in the isolated ruin and are desperately tired of being poor.  The new landlords come to visit; Simon Cotton (Henry Thomas) and his brother are rich, young, and single.  Rose sets her sights on Simon and vows to marry him for his money, even if she doesn't love him.  And younger sister Cassandra wants very much to be in love, too.

The story is narrated by Cassandra as she writes in her diary.  Romola Garai is perfect as the plain, thoughtful younger sister, the lovely Byrne is convincing as the flirty big sister, and Henry Thomas is a sincere suitor.  Bill Nighy steals the show with his larger-than-life personality and manic behavior.  The year 1936 is reproduced in fine detail, and the English countryside is beautifully photographed.

Unfortunately the music was bombastic, overbearing, this Vangelis heavy beat as though the girls were racing down the beach in CHARIOTS OF FIRE, totally anachronistic.

Sinead Cusack was ghastly as the Cotton boys' mother, and what kind of American accent was she supposed to be using?  It was like nothing on earth and didn't seem to be synched up to her lip movements.

The little boy who played Thomas, the stud who played Stephen, and Tara Fitzgerald as Topax were all excellent.  What happened to Tara Fitzgerald, only a few years ago she would have been playing Rose, she was the ingenue in every British movie imported into US theaters.  Sad the way time flutters by and today's hot young thing is now playing tomorrow's stepmother!  And her hair looked like the hair of an old hag in a Walter Scott novel-one who lives in a cave.

I thoroughly approve of Romola Garai as Cassandra Mortmain.  I thought she was perfect for the part.  Rose Byrne was not as gorgeous as I had hoped, as Rose, with her huge cheeks and beady little eyes.  She looked ghastly and gained 20 years when Mrs. Cotton cut off her And makeup artists should have painted over that distracting blemish on her face that grew worse throughout the movie.  However she was perfectly piquant in the exotic pink crinoline dress with black shoes and the red feather in her hair that she wote when bringing her family to dinner with the Cottons.  Cassandra's blue dress she wore in the nightclub was also lovely.

Henry Thomas and Marc Blucas were also underwhelming.  Blucas used to be so good looking as Riley Finn on the TV version of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  Here he looked pasty and unfit.  Henry Thomas was doing all his acting with his eyes.  He seemed to be leading Cassandra on during their dance to ""You and The Night and The Music.""  It was mesmerizing, but I for once thought he was in love with her, afterwards he said he kissed her just because she was so funny and amusing and sweet.  Right.

Finally I'm of two minds about Bill Nighy.  He's always the same in every picture, but I think his manic, worn-out quietude was fitting for James Mortmain.

The book is insightful and touching but also very funny, with some really wonderful, original language.  It's clever and poignant and has one of the most delightful narrators out there.

The movie, on the other hand, gets so bogged down with sentimentality that it just drags along, devoid of energy. There are some beautiful locations and the cast looks okay and seems capable enough, but the film has been directed as a heavy drama with deep dark pain at its core-- instead of a romantic coming-of-age story that mixes comedy, drama and quirky charm in equal measure. Everyone in the movie just seems so miserable, even in scenes where they're supposed to be happy.

The voice-over narration is one of the biggest problems.  In the book the story is told through the journal entries of 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, a very bright aspiring writer, and her voice has an intensity, precociousness and excitement that just hurls the reader blissfully along; but in the movie Cassandra's voice-over narration lacks every single one of these qualities and instead has a solemn, mournful tone.  This is probably more the director's fault than the actress's, although some blame should also go to the screenwriter, who has the unfortunate habit of substituting her own annoyingly mediocre narration and dialogue in place of the often brilliant language that's readily available in Dodie Smith's novel.  The screenwriter also seems to have felt the need to invent more than one scene completely out of nowhere; one huge scene in particular between Cassandra and her father is not only NOT in the book, but it contradicts everything the book stands for-- and in such a maudlin, obvious, after-school-special type of way.

One really cannot help but feel sorry for the orphaned farmhand boy who is so desperately in love with Cassandra.  Of course the entire she loves him/he loves the other girl/who loves someone else setup of the plot makes for a sad and poignant tale, but the actors do not lose themselves in saccharine or trite portrayals of lovesick fools or trounced love interests.

I enjoy this film immensely. It brings to mind that other fascinating British adaptation, ""Cold Comfort Farm"" starring Kate Beckinsale. ""I Capture the Castle"" has that sweet, romantic, dreamy feel that completely enraptures the viewer with its charm, humor and wit.
The story centers around 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain (Romola Garai of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" and ""Daniel Deronda"") and her eccentric family.  Her father (Bill Nighy of ""Love Actually"" and ""Underworld"") is an author who hasn't written a word in 10 years. Her sister Rose (Rose Byrne of ""Troy"" and ""Star Wars Episode II) yearns to marry well and get away from their dreary, depressed circumstances. Her stepmother Topaz (Tara Fitzgerald of ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"") is an eccentric artist who tries to keep her family together. Cassandra and her brother Thomas appear to be the only sensible beings in their household.  Everyone else seems to be falling apart. Then there is their Adonis-like helper Stephen (an eye-opening role for Henry Cavill of ""Count of Monte Cristo"") who really does remind me of a Greek god.
The Mortmain's lives are turned upside down with the arrival of the wealthy Cotton brothers (Henry Thomas of ""E.T."" and ""I'm With Lucy"" and Marc Blucas).  Soon enough, Stephen falls in love with Cassandra who falls in love with older brother Simon Cotton who  falls in love with Rose. Before long, Rose is planning her wedding.  The story climaxes when secrets are revealed and the phrase ""you cannot control who you fall in love with"" really does come to play.
The highlights of this film are the brilliant performances, namely of Romola Garai, Rose Byrne and Bill Nighy; the gorgeous and dreamy cinematography; and the enchanting story. It is, above all, a story of love and hope, and Cassandra's optimism throughout the story really shines through. I highly recommend it!",1074816000,41,2052,4.950581395348837

The charm of the book lies in the wit of the narrator, Cassandra, even when she writes about her family's poverty, her father's temper, etc.  It's all told from a comic slant that contrasts with the subject matter nicely.  The movie lost that slant and wallowed in melodrama too often.  For instance, the eccentric, selfish, but extremely charming, father becomes simply dysfunctional in the film, stripped of his charisma.
The biggest flaw of the film is that the director, instead of standing in the narrator's 1930-ish shoes, imposes a modern context on the subject, which transformed it into a run-of-the-mill drama, and strips out most of the book's wittiness.  The movie even adds a ridiculous touchy-feely reconciliation scene between the father and Cassandra at the end that would have made Dodie Smith puke.
Sigh . . . Maybe someone who's more deft with period pieces will try a lighter hand with this material and get it right in the future.",1074643200,106,1171,4.748768472906404
1942822,4,B0000SX9MS,"The book by Dodie Smith is such a superb read, with such a different air of time and place and a sincere inner growing up account, that any movie aspiring to rise up to its magic is sure to fail. The book manages to captivate the reader from its first pages in its detailed account of the eccentric weird family. Having said that I have to admit that my viewing was largely affected by the fact I read the book beforehand and thus necessarily damaged my objective judgement of this film as a stand-alone work of art.
Yes, compared to the book this is a much inferior work of art. I am not sure the viewers are able to grasp the depth of the inner turmoil both sisters are undergoing, the nature of the father's work or the whole family involvement in this work. The large impact the father's writing (or lack of writing) has on their lives and not just money wise. The film, I admit, is nice to watch and the characters portrayal is very close to what I imagined while reading. The castle itself is amazing and lends its atmosphere to the whole movie - you can almost feel how damp and cold it is. In this case only I fell that seeing is better then reading. However, I remained feeling that if I had only seen the movie I would not have truly understood the story. This is not just a love story. Romantic love is just a vehicle to grow up, or so I understood it, and bonds of love and caring between family members are also one of the main themes of this work.
All actors have fresh, very fitting faces, close to the way I perceived them upon reading. Romola Garai especially is great as Cassandra, a girl in an ""in between"" stage, turning from a young adolescent to a clever woman whose personal aches and pains bring on a better understanding of other people. Tara Fitzgerald is captivating as the stepmother Topaz.
In spite of my criticism I give this movie 4 points, as it is quite a different unique movie that holds some of the book's magic.",1073779200,4,1948,4.325136612021858
1942823,5,B0000SX9MS,"I CAPTURE THE CASTLE is an inordinately beautiful film, blessed by a fine script adapted from the successful novel by Dodie Smith, a fine director who knows how to pace a film, beautiful cinematography, and a cast that is impeccable.  ""Capturing the castle"" is both a real storyline and a metaphor for the struggle to find the self at the doorstep of maturity.  What begins as a fairytale adventure - a small family moves into a real though dilapidated castle after the father is released from custody for wife abuse - becomes a withering fantasy as reality creeps into their lives.  Since the mother died the father is unable to continue his successful flow of writing and hopes that living in a castle will open his writer's block.  His daughters and son must adapt to the pauper life despite their 'castle', share their dreams, and eventually the light toward escape comes in the form of two American brothers who now own the property on which the castle sits.  At this point the story frolics through the romances of the sisters, the addition of a stepmother and the eventual resolution of dreams for one daughter and the comfortable longing for love for the other daughter.
The cast includes the radiant Romola Garai and Rose Byrne as the sisters, Bill Nighy as the blocked writer/father, Tara Fitzgerald (VERY sensitive actress) as the stepmother, Henry Thomas and Marc Bluca as the American brothers, and one Henry Cavill as Stephen - the beautiful Adonis boy who remains in the background and serves only as a sensual propellant to the girl's grounded dreams.
In a field of movies that try very hard to be Oscar contenders, I CAPTURE THE CASTLE seems content to be exactly what it is - a luminously beautiful simple film that will capture your heart.",1073347200,9,1758,4.769736842105263
1942824,5,B0000SX9MS,"I Capture the Castle, based on the 1933 novel of the same name by Dodie Smith, beautifully captures the characters and plot elements of the book and also stands on its own as an entertaining film. It is the story of a poor and isolated family in the English countryside. 17-year old Cassandra offers a charming (if flawed) narration to her family story -- the tale of how her brilliant novelist father's long-standing writer's block has affected her beautiful sister Rose and free-spirit stepmother Topaz. Things seem to be going nowhere but downhill until two brothers show up -- the new owners of the family's rundown castle. Though the plot has few surprises, the film is still quite engaging and fun, thanks in large part to a fine adaptation, great cast and terrific design.  One needn't have read the book to enjoy the film, and those who love the book should not be disappointed.

DVD extras include a commentary track with the director, writer and producer; an interview with Ramola Garai, who plays Cassandra (8 minutes); 4 deleted scenes and an alternate ending; a trailer.  Language and subtitles are available in English only.",1073347200,23,1138,4.8860103626943

8002425,2,B0000SX9MS,"I typically adore English movies and generally give them a lot of latitude, when it comes to critique, but I found this to be the most sophomoric piece of tripe I've ever watched. The acting was abysmal, particularly of the women, who appeared to be playing CARICATURES of women and girls, based on some imaginary mode of behavior that would have been more appropriate for an Elizabethan drama, rather than a fairly contemporary story from the 20th century! The men weren't quite as bad, and that may have just been a function of them not having as many lines as the girls. I suspect that the fault lies, at its core, with the writer and director. I had to suspend disbelief with regard to quite a lot, especially their living arrangements, in a wildly dilapidated, musty English castle.  (Fairy tale, anyone?) I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes of the film, leaving off when the girls inherit the most unlikely garments from an aunt: a bear coat and another made of monkey fur, and they find themselves jumping off a train and crawling through the dust bins when they see the rich boys in which they have a desperate interest. Ridiculous. Not funny at all. I felt sorry for the actresses, having to appear in this flop.",1511222400,,1226,4.623853211009174
