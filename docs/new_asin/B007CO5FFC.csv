5077692,5,B007CO5FFC,"Quick, dark comedy...if you're not interested based on those three words, you're not interested. If you are, this is your new favorite show.

House Of Lies is fast-paced, quick-witted comedy skewering politics, sex, race, business...all equally and without scruples.

Amazing cast, great acting, stylized editing...this show has it all. Do yourself a favor and jump in.",1354147200,5,369,5.571428571428571

5077695,4,B007CO5FFC,"Is This Why 75% of a Recent Yale MBA Class Applied to McKinsey & Company?

Then there is the follow up work that keeps on paying like an insurance residual!  Welcome to the world of Management Consultants.

Marty (Don Cheadle), Jeannie (Kristen Bell) et al work for the #2 rated firm.  Every week the team led by Marty travel to a different city to convince a business that they are the solution to whatever ails them.  The goal is to sign the deal with a teaser/idea and then ink a long term contract for ""after work"".

What I really liked:

1.) Having seen management consultant firms in action, I always questioned the value of their ideas, when in most cases they had at best a basic understanding of what ""my"" business entailed?  I have had some fun in this respect in the past

2.) The MA rating allows for no punches to be pulled.  Constant sex, foul language and adult situations abound!

3.) Ever since Veronica Mars was prematurely cancelled, I had it on my short list to see Kristen Bell in another program where I could ""see"" Kristen Bell

4.) The first episode draws you in and is a particular favorite of mine as it culminates by outlining how a major lender can garner positive press by offering a modification program, which is essentially a ""shell game""

Some of the story lines are uneven.  Marty has a pill popping ex-wife (that happens to work for the #1 consulting firm) and a son that may be sexually ambiguous.  Jeannie is engaged to a ""Richie Rich"", though is seemingly unsatisfied.  Oh, there is also a potential merger that Marty opposes.

All in, this is a very good show with an excellent cast.",1337040000,20,1622,4.518900343642612

5077697,5,B007CO5FFC,Great show!  Binged watched all 5 seasons in a week!  I always loved Kristen Bell... but the entire cast is great and have awesome chemistry!  Great type of humor too!!  Definitely rated R.,1499644800,,189,4.636363636363637

In this instance 2057 positive reviews were wrong and 567 mostly one-star reviews were spot on.  The producers of this series were obviously targeting an audience too unsophisticated to realize they were being distracted by nudity, sex, and vulgarity from noticing how shallow and empty the actual story is.",1497398400,2,470,5.0

5077704,1,B007CO5FFC,"A great cast of actors doing a stellar job of playing characters who are the prime examples of wasted lives: wastes of air, space, resources- living parasitic and self-centered existences purely for their own material self-gratification and contributing absolutely nothing back into the world they live in. The dialogue is clever, albeit unnecessarily crass and often offensive. Cheadle and Bell are top-notch in their roles. The storylines show the writers' ability to exemplify the ugliness of capitalist exploitation to the nth degree. All in all, if your version of entertainment is watching a train wreck and laughing at the destruction, this might be your kind of show. But unless these are the kind of people that you happen to like, there is not a single character on this show worth rooting for.",1490140800,2,804,5.098484848484849

5077723,5,B007CO5FFC,I think that House of Lies is a great show! It thrives on making the viewer think & wonder your own actions in the same situation. You will definitely choose your character to love or hate with this show and it gives you actors show real life. I love it!,1486166400,,254,4.1

But don't let that stop you. S1 is perfect and complete in its own right, and SHOULD DEFINITELY BE WATCHED. You heard it here.",1481760000,,447,4.373493975903615

I get the premise is a bunch of people who lie or polish turds or any number of other distasteful things, but this show is a reflection on how we might accept this. My guess is that people who loved the behavior of Sons of Anarchy characters will also love these people. At least the evil lead in Dexter was of value to society in SOME way.
That said... the side plot of the son is humanizing. Unfortunately, his parents are both scumbags and he really deserves far better.

Substantively, it's a pretty solid production. It's an HBO series and has what you expect out of an HBO series: that you shouldn't be appalled going in by the language and the subject matter; that it's paced pretty well; that it's (over)acted okay; that it's written kinda/sorta alright. I think it's the writing that puts me off; each of the three I watched is formulaic and the formula is to take the rep company, set it up with the problem for the show, confront it with an obstacle and overcome the obstacle with some outrageous-sounding, mildly-creative solution in the last five minutes. Meanwhile, the company strips down to what the producers believe to be the raw essence of modern interpersonal communication and relating to each other but, dudes, you lay it on so thick it loses its shock value.

I'd like to know what's wrong here? What it's not got that'd make it what I want it to be? I think it's lack of higher vision at the top and in the center. This is business, though, and it's none of my business how you guys decide to run your business, particularly if you're making money doing it.",1469318400,,1312,4.508403361344538

5078601,4,B007CO5FFC,"House of Lies is smart, witty, fast-paced comedy about a team of high dollar managing consultants. The humor is strictly for mature audiences, and there is gratuitous nudity and profanity, so be warned. Don Cheadle is brilliant as the team leader, and the four main cast members work together seamlessly. Cheadle somehow manages to give depth to a character who is quite shallow. He makes us empathize with a greedy wheeler-dealer who seemingly has no moral compass.",1467849600,,466,5.064935064935065

8514650,4,B007CO5FFC,"This series came into hilarity late in season 1 during the episode where they bring on my potential recruits.  I am just now into season 2 but looking towards the climax of this series, hopefully it wasn't premature.  However, I really like Kristen Bell and how she breaks down other's preconceived notions of her talent. As well there are other great characters included that keep me asking how far truly will this series go?",1515456000,,426,4.743243243243243

8514652,3,B007CO5FFC,"Just a mediocre show with utterly predictable plot lines.  It's essentially Entourage, but for men in suits.  Every problem is solved with cheap sex, and BS.  This is the opposite of a show like Mad Men, which captured an industry, a way of talking and thinking, a way of dressing and being.  This is just cheap TV.",1512000000,,315,4.473684210526316
