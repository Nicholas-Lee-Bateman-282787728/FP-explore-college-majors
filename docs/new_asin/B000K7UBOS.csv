2683402,5,B000K7UBOS,"All Latin classrooms should have this Rick Steves Italy DVD. We watch these 25 minute television shows as part of studying Sicily, Ancient and Baroque Rome, Venice, Florence, Siena, and Cinque Terre.  This DVD replaced VHS tapes I had been using.  It arrived on time and in excellent packaging.",1243641600,2,294,4.979591836734694

2683404,5,B000K7UBOS,"Has there ever been another travel guide more amiable, more informative, more eclectic and just plain likeable than Rick Steves?  This somewhat nerdish but pleasant looking fellow will immediately win the viewer over with his charm, humor and smoothing, layback manner. However what will keep you watching program after program is his consummate knowledge of the sites and people he visits.

While each journey is only 30 minutes in length Rick has a unique talent of synthesizing the many facets that make up a people and place. He leaves no stone unturned in his analysis; historical background, spiritual heritage, cultural underpinnings and political legacy are all equally touched upon to give the audience a fuller understanding of the rural and urban landscape.

However not not an individual to dwell too much on the past, he provides a delightful tour of the markets, music, restaurants and nightlife. The kind of information would really want to know if you're out for a good time.

The production values are also wonderful offering fanstastic visuals that are worth watching even if there where no commentary. Traveling with Rick Steves' is the next best thing to being there.

This particular DVD contains seven episodes, thirty minutes in length. Imagine three and one half hours in Rome, Venice, Florence and more, better get started!",1207526400,25,1348,5.165137614678899
2683405,1,B000K7UBOS,"I purchased Rick Steves' Italy's Cities to give to my niece for Mother's Day. I wanted to see for myself so I put on the DVD. To my disappointment it is defective. It kept repeating the same parts over and over; the sound would cut out and the picture remain. I unfortunately can't locate the receipt for it so I'm stuck with it. However, it makes me aware that when ordering anything, I must hold onto my receipts in case the item (s) are defective.",1202515200,,450,4.305882352941176
2683406,5,B000K7UBOS,"...though, I haven't actually travelled anywhere.  I mean, the man is friendly, spontaneous and so open-minded.  From what I have gathered, from the episodes that I have seen of Rick Steves' adventures in Italy, he is as much in love with the food, culture, art and people as he is in sharing his experience with us, the humble viewers at home.  Even if you have never been to Venice, Florence, Naples and the numerous other cities that he treks through, in his travels, Steves succeeds in bringing a real level of accessiblity and unabashed joy toward planning trips, venturing on to the backroads and talking with locals.

The photography in these episodes is glorious, and you can almost feel the warmth of sun, at midafternoon, when he makes his way through a cobblestoned town or a more modernized city.  Rick Steves really celebrates the community of humankind with his journeys, and what's more, makes us want to celebrate it with him.  If you are going to invest in anything, lay down your green for these DVDs.  You won't be sorry!",1178150400,38,1040,4.7444444444444445

2683409,4,B000K7UBOS,I gave it 4 stars just because it is so big that it is hard to carry around but it was great for research and to help us plan what we did want to see.

8154627,3,B000K7UBOS,"Okay the Milan edition was awful but the venice history and cinematography was so great i had to add another star! if all of them were like the Venice episode, I'd give it five stars.
 I am really annoyed however, for when I did a search I only came up with the Italy 2000-2007 amazon instant video. Then I realized there were  newer versions ONLY after purchasing the older version so i am annoyed with the non-user friendly amazon video search.

I am happy with the Venice video i got though-thrilled.
However, the Milan episode was grainy and awful : it states 2006 but I doubt it since  everyone dressed like it was the 80's  and no one eas speaking on a cell phone.  .  And I at first didn't understand Rick Steves but I guess he's just a good guy. Other than the fact that NO he is really a self-interested Narcissist that no one who works with him in Europe can stand.  The sad thing is that a sophisticated New Yorker would do a much better job and probably would not be such a narcissist knowing her roots-knowing where she came from and not being such an annoying nationalistic""american"" but we have to deal with Steves because New Yorkers have better things to do.  Lastly, I was a little girl in the eighties and he appeared to be in his forties riding trains in Europe; now I read he is like 56?  He looked REALLY old in 1986-7. lol",1453161600,,1345,4.322709163346613
8154628,4,B000K7UBOS,Interesting - gave good overall information. Thinking it might be a bit out of date at this point but Rick is always a great source of information.,1436572800,,147,4.481481481481482
