7964787,5,B000068TOR,"Not all the movies here are winners ... but you cannot beat the variety and choice of subject matter.  This collection features the early work of people like Kirk Douglas, Robert Preston, and - of course - Marlon Brando in his one and only directing/starring role.  An all-around great deal.",1366934400,,291,4.8
7964788,5,B000068TOR,"...if this collection contained only two of these tales it would be worth the money, but it has lots more.  'One-eyed Jacks' and 'The Big Trees' are here in very good quality and are Classic tales of good vs. evil in old times. If you're a fan of old westerns you can't loose with this. Some of the other films are of lesser quality transfers, but hey, they're old.",1188777600,,365,4.2898550724637685
7964789,3,B000068TOR,"THE LAW AND THE LAWLESS is an unusual mixture of the great, the good and the ghastly. The newest title here gets almost universal low marks. There's four spaghetti westerns of middling quality, including one with no American or British actors in it.

7964790,4,B000068TOR,"I'll provide a brief synopsis of each of the 10 films included in this budget collection:

One Eyed Jacks (1961) - Brando directs and stars in this tale of friendship gone bad.  Co-starring Karl Malden, also with Ben Johnson & Slim Pickens.  Nominated for an Oscar and eminently watchable.  Almost underrated.  Rating: 7/10

Sundowners (1950) - Not the famous one set in Australia with Robert Mitchum.  A mediocre brother VS brother picture with Robert Preston.  6/10

Big Trees (1952) - Kirk Douglas as a timber baron & the Quaker community that stands between him and the forest.  Also with Alan Hale Jr.  Not bad, not great.  6/10

Vengeance Valley (1951) - Cain & Abel tale with Burt Lancaster & Robert Walker.  Mostly forgettable, but Walker is amusingly hammy as the ""evil"" one.  5/10

Boot Hill (1969) - Well, it's an actual spaghetti western (Italian) but that doesn't mean it isn't boring.  Terence Hill is bland as milquetoast.  5/10

God's Gun (1976) - Lee Van Cleef (yeah!) as an ex-priest hot on the trail of a gang of killers led by Jack Palance.  Unintentionally hilarious at points, and apparently filmed by the most inept bunch of drunks available at the time, it's still pretty good for an Italian spaghetti western.  At least entertaining enough to laugh at or along with.  7/10

Death Rides A Horse (1967) - Lee Van Cleef (yeah!) in a real Italian revenge spaghetti Western.  Need I say more?  The best of the bunch!  8/10

Beyond The Law (1968) - Lee Van Cleef (yeah!) in yet another tale of revenge and theft.  He's an outlaw, he's the sheriff, he's good, he's bad,  what is he, who knows?!  Just watch.  7/10

Blood And Honor (2000) - One of these things is not like the other... it's a Civil War tale that will put you to sleep.  Really, really bad.  3/10

Sundance & The Kid (1969) - Okay, this one's gotta go.  First off, it has NOTHING to do with the 2 title characters of Newman & Redford.  2nd, it's a fairly dumb story about 2 brothers that will inherit a pile of cash if they can live peaceably with each other for half a year.  Did i mention these ""brothers"" spend large portions of the film without shirts on, doing masculine things like chopping wood, taking baths and being tortured?  Hey if distinctly ""male"" spaghetti westerns are your thing, it's all you.  2/10

If you are just looking for the Lee Van Cleef films (and who isn't?) there is a smaller 4-film collection entitled Gunslingers which might be enough for you.  And if you can't get enough, there's another 10-film set entitled Tales Of The Gun, track it down for more of the same.",1171670400,13,2579,4.578021978021978
7964791,5,B000068TOR,"this collection from bcieclipse is yet another set of westerns and these are even better than the wild west collection.the big news here is ""one eyed jacks"" brando's only movie that he directed,it looks good and hold on you who say these collections aren't good,it's in WIDESCREEN,yes WIDESCREEN. a great collection and worth the price.",1146355200,2,336,5.127272727272727
