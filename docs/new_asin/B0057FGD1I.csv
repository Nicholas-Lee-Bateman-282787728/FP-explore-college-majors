Las batallas, la trama, el crecimiento... la serie presenta el proceso de crecimiento de una heroina. Simplemente tiene que verse. Nota: Es altamente adictiva... despues de ver un episodio se sentira la curiosiedad de saber que paso !!!",1324944000,2,323,4.890909090909091
4595305,1,B0057FGD1I,"As matter of fact there is so much ""Animated Nudity and Fan Service"" that it is distracting.

The story was good But due to the fact they cram as much ""Fan Service"" into this and the first Queen's blade that you will lose the story.

The animation is rather good but again you get distracted by the ""Nudity"".

The voices are done really well.

I am one who dose not mind a little bit of ""Fan Service"" but when it is distracting so much that it takes away from the story, the animation and the movie(s) all together it gets annoying it is like they were trying to put as much ""Fan Service as they could into it to just come close to almost a hentai....I watched this not expecting a hentai but that's exactly IMO what you get. Very disappointed in films that could of been so much more.

And as to why I watched the second one when I felt poorly about the first one is simple I thought they may improve and not have as much fan service but I was wrong.

If you like Animated nudity and Fan Service then this one is for you but if you want a good story thats not distracted by the ""Fan Service"" then look at others.

I have been collecting and watching Anime for along time and all this is In My Opinion (IMO). Hope this review helps you out.",1322611200,5,1240,4.1203319502074685

4595307,1,B0057FGD1I,"If you like your anime with a good storyline, solid characters, quality voice acting and without tasteless fan service, avoid this anime like the plague.",1321833600,4,153,5.16
4595308,5,B0057FGD1I,"This is a review of the Blu- Ray version of Queen's Blade 2. For those who did not see Queen's Blade 1 the basic story is that every four years beautiful women warriors fight it out to decide who will be queen. This battle was instituted by the angels to keep even more devastating wars from happening. In QB 1 our heroine, Leina, sets out to escape her father (and sisters) and eventually travels to the capital city to join the the battle. Along the way she runs into many other warrior and a somewhat flaky angel, plus three minions of the evil swamp witch. QB 1 concludes with everyone arriving at the capital for the final battle.

The battle wear of the girls is almost always some brassier and a thong. Fairly quickly they lose almost all their clothes, thus gaining a 16+ rating. This fan service is not just once but almost constantly throughout the show. Queen's Blade 2 is not just the same, but even more so. There are three different closing credits scenes with the three different swamp witch minions, but all exude overt sexuality, with words to match. The artwork is very good, especially in blu-ray.

QB 2 is given over to the official battles in the capital for the queen's title. It rapidly becomes apparent in this show that the real evil person to be beaten is the old queen, who has been running around encasing people in stone. In fact the minions of the evil swamp witch are entered in the tournament. The swamp witch herself is never really seen anywhere in the series and is pretty much something of a non-player. During QB 2 each of the girls who entered the contest get a chance to battle for the queens title, even the flaky angel. Every warrior gets to work our her story so there are almost no questions left unanswered. Our heroine gains experience and strength with each of her battles until she gets to face the queen. The storyline stays engaging, thus really does deserving 5 stars.

There are a host of extras included, including 12 OVAs, opening and closing animations without text, and some interviews with the Japanese voice actresses at a Japanese anime convention.",1318982400,35,2106,4.595744680851064
4595309,5,B0057FGD1I,"If you bought the first Bluray you know the quality of the animation is almost flawless, absolutely beautiful animation, colors, and artstyle. The story might be very silly and indecent for those that are not into this genre... but if you're a fan of epic stories and fan-service driven anime, you will find it very entertaining all through out. Truly a must-buy of the genre because of the blatant over-the-top animation. Even with all the nudity and sillyness, they still manage to deliver a solid touching story, the score helps this quite a bit because it has that very heroic-feel... which makes it very emotional. It kind of makes you forget that the hero of the story and most of the fighters are half nude, quite an achievement I say, lol.

Cheers.",1318982400,21,756,4.7272727272727275
4595310,5,B0057FGD1I,"I bought this series since I had the entire DVD collection. I bought this to go with the Bluray first season of Queens Blade so I could make my own limited edition artbox. I did the same with my DVD collection of Queen's Blade, Ikkitousen the complete series beside Ikki Tousen Dragon Destiny first three volumes in a nicely done art box along with my personal favorite of the DVD and Bluray High School of the Dead Art Box.",1358294400,,424,4.379746835443038
4595311,4,B0057FGD1I,"But alot of fan service, even for a lots of skin exposed sword and sorcery fantasy, and they have a lot of it this has even more, but still very worth the watch for this title.",1356825600,,176,3.9166666666666665
4595312,5,B0057FGD1I,"season 2 is great, since you spend the whole first season talking about a huge tournament (the namesake queen's blade) and never see the actual tournament.  this part of the series takes all of the characters from the first season further, adds some new characters, and brings the whole story together better.  season one is great, this is an excellent follow up",1356739200,,362,4.82258064516129
4595313,4,B0057FGD1I,"Heavy amounts of fanservice, but I was surprised at how good the plot actually is. This was a good anime. It has some nice bonus features as well.",1354492800,,146,4.25
4595314,5,B0057FGD1I,"Queen's Blade 2 continues where the first one left off.  The tone of the anime is much the same as the first series.  It's still women fighting women often missing important pieces of clothing.  It's still on the lighter side in terms of emotional impact for a fighting series.  I believe that only one character actually dies during the time frame of this series.  The pace of this series is a little faster than the first one.  I believe that once the battle start, the second or third episode, at least one battle is completed in each episode.  Sometimes two or more.  Besides the pace that the battles come and go, a lot of story elements happen outside the battles, plus the comedy elements of the first series continue on in this one.  If you liked the first Queen's Blade, this is worth getting to complete the story.",1333584000,5,824,4.513513513513513
4595315,4,B0057FGD1I,"I enjoyed Queen's Blade. It has a good story line, with decent music and action. More for fans who enjoy eye candy or fan service. Still, all around I give it a 4 star rating just because it is good, but not a favorite.",1332374400,,219,4.0
4595316,5,B0057FGD1I,"I love this series. Well drawn, great story and the bluray has excellent audio and video. There is some nudity and sexual situations if that offends you look elsewhere.",1329609600,,168,4.827586206896552
4595317,4,B0057FGD1I,"Certainly better than I expected... it actually becomes a story.  The motives of the ""Swamp Witch"" are never explored, unfortunately, but the fights are good at least.",1329436800,,167,5.185185185185185
4595318,5,B0057FGD1I,"*I'm not going to get into serious detail about this anime because there are seven more detailed reviews to read.
I highly recommend someone to watch this if they are over 18 and have a perverted side to them. Queens Blade is NOT for everyone!
In every episode their is some sort of nudity and most of the characters are dressed in skimpy clothing.
Once again this anime takes fan service to a whole different level.",1329091200,,416,4.4868421052631575
4595319,5,B0057FGD1I,"I purchased the complete bluray series ""Queens Blade: The Exiled Virgin"" for $35. Good news, there are six episodes on each disk (2 disk bluray series). Disk-1 has full episodes 1-6, and disk-2 has full episodes 7-12. The only way to know this is to go into the scene access menu on the title screen.
By the way, I also purchased the complete bluray series ""Queens Blade-2: The Evil Eye"" for $30. Listen folks, its another 12 episode sequel!! If this whole thing was sold as a bluray ""collection"", there would be a total of 4-disks and 24-episodes! Yes, there are 24-episodes of Queen's Blade. Here are the links:

8460583,4,B0057FGD1I,"If you're here you hopefully have seen the first ""season"" of Queen's Blade episodes and want the second half.  The diverse, almost-entirely female cast of warriors continue their march towards a showdown with the tyrranical queen of Gynos.  This is one of the best guilty-pleasure titles I've seen, and is definitely pr0n with plot, good world-building, and great character acting.  It's great to see longtime adult animators like Rin Sin doing such fine work without having to disrobe the principals entirely.",1444176000,,510,5.271604938271605
