This is a wonderful version of ""Giselle"", but, ""Sleeping Beauty"" has been condensed to the point of desecration, the reason for only four stars. Don't buy it just for Sleeping Beauty, (as I did). It's cut to pieces, and only 94 minutes. A good ""Beauty"" should be at least 130 minutes. If the price is right, however, buy it for Giselle. This is a single disc with both ballets, and you may LIKE this ""Beauty"", but both of these ballets are available as single DVDs.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-Giselle-Karen-Kain-Frank-Augustyn-National-Ballet-of-Canada/dp/B00022LJ38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam - Giselle / Karen Kain, Frank Augustyn, National Ballet of Canada</a>&nbsp;This Giselle is IMO the best version in my collection of five, including the La Scala version w/Svetlana Zakharova and Roberto Bolle, and the Bolshoi version w/Natalia Bessmertnova and Mikhail Lavrovsky, the Bavarian State Opera version w/Rudolf Nureyev and Lynn Seymour, and The Royal ballet version w/Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg  The Canadian version is 85 minutes, and the others are 105, 86, 78, 112 minutes respectively. The extra minutes in the La Scala and Royal Ballet versions are due to more peasant dance variations than the others.

The sets in the Canadian version are more beautiful than any of the others, (except The Royal Ballet) especially in the second act grave site scene. The grave site in this version is on the edge of a clearing in a forest, with a foggy lake in the background, and the fog rolls in off the lake into the clearing making it very eerie looking. The trees are covered with something that looks like ice or snow or perhaps cobwebs, and it too, is very eerie, and a wonderful setting for the Wilis.

Giselle is a beautiful young peasant maiden whose mother has an inn in the village. She is attracted to a young Duke, Albrecht who is already engaged to a Duchess, Bathilde. Giselle falls in love with him, and he seems to be genuinely in love with her. The problem arises when Bathilde enters the village with her entourage and stops to rest at the inn. Giselle discovers through Hilarion, a gamekeeper and in love with Giselle also, that Albrecht has deceived her. Then occurs the most emotional scene in all of ballet perhaps, when Giselle literally goes mad with grief. In her deranged state of mind, she picks up Albrecht's sword and stabs herself. She dies and of course I cry.

Wilis are ghosts of dead maidens who have been betrayed by their lovers before their weddings. They are led by Myrtha, the queen of the Wilis. She has an expression on her face that could easily freeze to death anyone who gazed upon her, however, their purpose is to cause any man they catch in the forrest to dance himself to death. Giselle is called from her grave by Myrtha and must join with the other Wilis in pursuit of their unfaithful lovers. They only appear at mid-night, and lose their power at daybreak. Hilarion is their first victim and later they catch Albrecht, who has come to morn at Giselle's grave. The last act is very emotional also, and the music by Adolphe Adam is very beautiful. When Giselle has to go back to her grave, of course I cry.

If you like emotional impact, this ballet is for you. It starts out as a touching love story, with lots of gaiety, beautiful music, wonderful dancing, drama, disaster, more drama, and finally love triumphant. All these things make Giselle one of the most beloved ballets of all time.",1219536000,,3613,4.934210526315789
