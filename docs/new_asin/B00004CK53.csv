7920460,3,B00004CK53,"This indie production of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST is a bit uneven, acting-wise.

While Efrem Zimbalist Jr. makes a fine Prospero, Ron Palillo as Trinculo is doing his Arnold Horshack ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" schtick. This edition, despite some performance and budget limitations, is true to the original and has the feel of an authentic 17th Century stageplay.

SYNOPSIS--
Prospero (the right Duke of Milan) and Miranda, his husband-hungry daughter are banished to a desolate island by Prospero's betraying brother Sebastian and the King of Naples. When a ship carrying his enemies comes near, Prospero casts a spell that creates a storm which wrecks the vessel, marooning all aboard on Prospero's prison island. One of these survivors, the King's son Ferdinand falls in love with Miranda, and she with him while Sebastian and the others wander dazedly around the island.

7920461,5,B00004CK53,"When I saw this production on Hallmark Hall of Fame in 1960, it was my first exposure to Shakespeare & I was hooked.  I remember the majesty & control of Maurice Evans, the beauty & vulnerability of Lee Remick, the pathos & threat of Richard Burton.  The fluid use of the sound stage was amazing to me, & I want to see it all again.  If someone who has oversight of such things sees this review, please arrange a reissue on DVD.  I would love to own a copy.",1279411200,3,457,4.101123595505618
7920462,5,B00004CK53,"This is the best version of The Tempest that I have seen. Maurice Evans is superb as Prospero, and to see the young Burton as Caliban is a delight and a rare treat.",1243987200,2,164,4.0
7920463,4,B00004CK53,"Hollywood has never done justice to Shakespeare's Tempest. I recommend this TV production. It is short and amateurish, but the cast is superb. Lovely Lee Remick is Prospero's daughter, Miranda. Richard Burton plays Caliban. I would have cast Burton as Prospero. Burton was a heavyweight and would have brought a dignity to the character which is lacking. Roddy McDowell as Ariel prances around like one of Schwarzenegger's ""girlie-men."" The Tempest is fun. There is something comforting about an island setting, a storm and an old man working magic to ensure his daughter's future.",1203638400,,581,5.258064516129032
7920464,5,B00004CK53,"A&E rebroadcast the 1960 made-for-TV version of Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" in the 80's and reminded me of the brilliance of early live television.  While confined to a typical studio stage, the production excelled in performances, costumes, and direction. Imagine Richard Burton stealing the show while made up as the monster Caliban, with the character's limited lines.  Lee Remick is youthful and beautiful.  Look for Leo McKern and Tom Poston in supporting roles.  Roddy MacDowell is perfect as the sprite Ariel and wears a costume that rivals any modern effort.  This production is nearly perfect and should be beheld by any lover of Shakespeare's work.",1147305600,8,658,5.288461538461538
