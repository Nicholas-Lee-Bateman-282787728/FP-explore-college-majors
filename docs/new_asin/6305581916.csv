7892155,4,6305581916,Yes for being a vhs tape it was good enough thanks.,1464048000,,51,3.727272727272727
7892156,5,6305581916,"I love this story and am a huge Richard Long fan.  I only got to watch the movie about 10 times and now the video is stuck and won't play.  I purchased the video in hopes it would be better quality than the You Tube rendition.  Alas, it was the same.  Wish I would have gotten the DVD now as at least it would still play.  Would love to trade my video in for a DVD now.  I love this movie and watch it in spite of the low quality of the recording.  The chemistry of Richard Long and Karen Valentine is great fun and how she woos him into the relationship he thinks he doesn't want and finally realizes he really does.",1374019200,,617,3.967479674796748
7892157,2,6305581916,"I realy like Karen Valentine, and was glad to see this available, however, this release is poor quality. Soft and contrasty. There is quite a bit of tearing in the screen durring bright scenes. (week sync signal and out of adjustment) Absolutely no effort was taken to make this a decent product.  It looks like an amature transfered it using a very cheap comercial machine with a 3rd generation copy.",1173398400,5,401,4.728571428571429
7892158,4,6305581916,"This movie is real cute! The age stuff was a bit confusing for someone my age-like him with his ""39th"" birthday, but it fits in good with the plot of the movie. It's a lot fun to see what stuff was like in the 70s like clothes, cars, bikes and more! If you're looking for a cute and kind of cheesy movie to pass the time this is the one to get!!",1109116800,5,345,3.8055555555555554
7892159,3,6305581916,The movie must have been re-released after the Farrah explosion as it lists her in a star role but she is actually in the film all of 3 minutes. LOL! The movie itself is way too cutesy for me & very unrealistic- but the 70's clothes & styles are fun to watch.,1005782400,3,259,4.0
7892160,5,6305581916,"I've always been a fan of Karen Valentine. This is a slightly more mature theme for her, but she still holds that innocence as in her Room 222 series. The plot molds well around her character's personality and Richard Long's interaction with her made the movie very enjoyable.",993081600,4,276,4.770833333333333
7892161,5,6305581916,"I saw this film for the first time on TV during my Senior year of high school when most girls are dreaming of finding ""Mr. Right"".  It was so wonderful to see such a wholesome love story...especially with a  girl that really wasn't much older!  Every woman who loves a good romance  will adore this movie!",963273600,10,305,4.392857142857143
