7554121,5,B018QRGMAA,"FishFlix sent me the newly released movie  94 Feet which is the harrowing story of a small Indiana coal mining community which is met with catastrophe. Although the location is fiction based, the events are true St. Michaels is a town where people work hard.  They are family oriented and basically good people. St. Michaels has been financially spent since a number of their businesses have gone bankrupt. The movie focuses on the layoff's of the coal miners group;  which the people respected for generations.  Now it is feared that it will lend to their doom.  Long standing members of the town decide to leave.  Others are on the brink of losing hope. The characters are impeccable, making the story come to life.  While watching I felt akin to Chris and Denise Rossi who both lost their father's to coal mining collapses.  Chris has a best friend, Marco who is quite the character.  Their friendship keeps the watchers on a roller coaster of laughter and tears.  And than it happens, on what seems to be the last work for many who were laid off or who are leaving, the mine collapes 94 feet.  With little air to survive, we witnesses employees helping one another to survive and helping the dying.  The community unites together in Faith.  Without spoiling the movie I have to say it is one of the most powerful movies I ever seen .  I loved it! These type of movies are my favorite. As a Christian we all face adversity and tribulations and I enjoy learning how others get through their most difficult times.  I vow to learn from these circumstances.  I highly recommend 94 Feet!",1464048000,2,1585,4.627240143369176

7554123,5,B018QRGMAA,"I got an email from a great source for Christian DVDs called FishFlix about this new 94 Feet movie coming out, and they asked if Id like to review it.  I said yes, since I had heard about it coming out previously, and really wanted to see it.  I watched it with my family, and it ended up being a GREAT movie.  There were times you were laughing, times of tears and many times of being thankful for your family!

The story was based on some local miners, that in my opinion are heroes.  God bless all of those that risk their lives in places underground, to look for things needed up top.  They are brave, strong and definitely willing to lose their lives to support their family.  Just seeing the workers put their dog tags up on the board before their shift, really made you think!

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys movies about action, family, friends and faith.  There are some great personal stories inside of the main story of the movie, and its perfect for anyone wanting to watch a movie that is good for almost any age.  It definitely gets you talking after and thinking of the pool game of Marco Polo a bit different!!  ..youll have to watch it to find out why!  #GotItFree",1460937600,2,1205,4.378378378378378
7554124,5,B018QRGMAA,"At its core, 94 feet is a wonderful retelling of the gospel message. It contains a variety of stories of people from all walks of life and all of this combines to create a powerful message of hope and faith. No matter what your background is, you will find a character to identify with in this powerful testimony.

94 Feet is a smaller film produced by a smaller group of people but it still packs in a great message of redemption and grace. This is a great film to take non-believers to as it lays out a simple and straightforward plan for salvation and how to find new hope in Jesus Christ. While the film can be heavy-handed and preachy at times, it still delivers a terrific and timeless message. I really enjoyed 94 Feet and would definitely recommend you check it out. It has a lot of heart and a wonderful message that I think is well worth your time.",1460678400,5,858,4.329192546583851
7554125,1,B018QRGMAA,"When I was contacted by FishFlix (they offer Christian DVDs) about potentially reviewing DVDs, I was open to it but requested that I know titles ahead of time so that I may determine if they would be something Id be interested in at all so as not to waste their or my time. I didn't hear back after that, but I did receive ""94 Feet"" DVD in the mail today with an appreciation letter for being willing to participate and the title FishFlix had picked out for me. So, I did not request this particular movie, but I watched it anyway and will do my part.

94 Feet states that it is based on true events. Im not sure which part of the film represents those events, but it is about a mining town that suffered from tragedy in years past and is now facing severe cutbacks and another tragedy. I wouldnt call it a Christian movie, though it is full of forced conversion stories that don't make any sensepeople asking others if they know Jesus, getting a negative response, telling them they can get a ticket to Paradise, and then praying Jesus into their heart. It gets weird when people begin trying to save others by praying them into heaven and then praying to one another. So, again, I wouldnt call that Christian just because Jesus name is used.

The movie itself felt like a dress rehearsal for a high school play with a camera rolling. It appears that much of the final cut is from first-takes. The camera is often focused behind or to the side of what it intendsmuch of what the viewer is intended to focus on is quite blurry while someones shoulder or something in the background is crystal clear. Theres a lot of overacting, missed and fumbled lines, and makeup jobs that are fit for Halloween trick-or-treaters.

At 114 minutes, this movie was an endurance test. Theres not much else I can comment on without offering spoilers.

This is just another example of this very good message and story but the poor acting and the obvious 10.00 budget make it hard to get through this movie.",1478563200,,329,4.409836065573771

8742700,3,B018QRGMAA,"Summary:
St. Michaels is a small mining town near economic collapse. One of the two main businesses has already ended and the second one is going to have major lay-offs. One particular couple has grown up in the town. They have lived through a mining disaster before. They were young but the impact of the event brought grave consequences. The husband is Chris Rossi and he is a crew leader working in the mine. He is deeply troubled about the lay-offs. The lay-off will affect his best friend. After making an agonizing decision, Chris decides to quit. But, before Chris's last day a disaster happens.

My Thoughts:
Larry Wilcox is listed as an actor in the film, 94 Feet, but he is not a main character. Larry Wilcox is a supporting actor.
I did not recognize any of the actors in the film from other films I've seen. It's possible the actors have played parts in other Christian films and I'm not acquainted with them.
There were a few scenes where I felt the acting was ""over the top."" The acting looked awkward and insincere. One of the wonderful elements about a film is when the characters do not act like they are acting, but they act in a manner that feels and looks realistic. It is easy to become absorbed in a film when an actor does not act as if they are pretending, but they are the character. They are living and breathing the role they are portraying.
At the end of the film, a few messages were not given to the surviving families. This may have been over-looked, or not felt necessary for the ending, or maybe not enough film length. I felt these messages were important.
The film's primary strength is the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. The film's strength is not in the acting abilities, nor the scenery, nor the props, nor the editing, nor the dialogue. The strength is in the message of salvation and eternal life in Jesus Christ.
A secondary strength is the town of St. Michaels itself. The film did an excellent job of showing the sadness of the town: boarded up shop windows, a dreary fall or winter landscape, and businesses closed. Nothing new is happening in St. Michaels. The town itself is in dire straits. The individuals who live in the town cling to hope. Most of the people portrayed are Christians. They pray for wisdom and peace during the economic hardship and mining disaster. Those who are not Christians are relatively docile in their unbelief. The disaster brings the town together in prayer and in service to those hurting. I was given a panoramic view of St. Michaels and felt emotion for their plight.
