5555048,5,B00B4GLL0C,"Now, I could talk your ear off about how brilliantly written The Color Spectrum is, from its ability to encompass a multitude of genres to the amazing production value and instrumentation. However, this product, and this review, isn't really about that. This is about the live show.

First of all, this performance is phenomenal. The Dear Hunter set out to perform nearly three hours of astoundingly different genres all in one show. They got a violin/string players, guest musicians, and god knows what else just to ensure that they can accurately recreate the eclectic brilliance that is The Color Spectrum. For such a small band, it is baffling how perfectly everything was executed (how they performed Therma is still beyond me). Casey, the singer, also manages to keep his voice tight throughout the entire set. All in all, the band puts on a stunning live show that is just distinguishable enough from the studio version to remind you that everything is being recreated live.

The sound quality and mixing itself is also top-notch. 5.1 surround sound? Hell yes! Lastly, the price is beyond reasonable. For $15, I'm surprised I didn't buy two.

Tl;dr - I highly recommend you buy this if you are a long time TDH fan, general music fan, or anyone who can recognize a stunning performance.",1363046400,11,1292,4.890410958904109
5555049,5,B00B4GLL0C,"I have been a Dear Hunter fan since their first album in 2006. Early on, I was struck by Casey Crescenzo's (founding member and primary songwriter)ability to blend elements of progressive rock, symphonic music and modern alternative into something that is sonically interesting, but not intimidating, catchy, but not 2 dimensional. Their first three albums (of a planned 6) follow the story of a young man in an early 1900's inspired world with recurring themes of war, lust and loss.

I never really got into the story, and you don't have to either in order to enjoy the Dear Hunter. Their music stands on its own. In 2011, Casey decided to put the story-themed albums on hold and record a set of 9 EP's, each corresponding to a different color in the color spectrum. The result is an impressive collection of 36 songs that range from bleak (black) to triumphant (white)and everywhere in between. The musical styles Casey invoked on each EP is equally impressive, spanning genres from Nine Inch Nails tinged industrial to alt-country to 70's garage rock. There's so much music and it is so varied that you could listen to segments of The Color Spectrum no matter what mood you're in. Needless to say, this ""album"" can easily occupy many months of your life as it did mine.

When I heard that The Dear Hunter would be performing the entire Color Spectrum for one night only in Boston, I was excited. I live in Massachusetts and have seen the Dear Hunter play live a few times, coming  away floored each time. I desperately wanted to go to this show. But alas, life got in the way and I missed this once in a lifetime chance to see my favorite band play their biggest concert yet. I was pretty disappointed. This DVD takes a bit of the sting away.

From start to finish, the concert is fantastic. I don't know how Casey can sing like he does for almost 3 hours without losing his voice. This concert is a stunning display of musicianship, songwriting, and endurance. The band is fantastic (particularly Nick Crescenzo on drums)and the guest musicians (Cameron Thorne of Naive Thieves, Andy Hull of Manchester Orchestra, and The Boston String Party)add tremendously to the performance.

The only annoyance is the audience. In my experience, Dear Hunter fans are respectful, but on that night, the crowd seemed particularly full of loudmouths trying to steal some attention from the band. At one point during the Green EP, members of the audience interrupted the show so a fan could propose to his girlfriend. This would have been cute if the band (who coincidentally knew the couple) was privy to the plan. But instead, the situation devolved into confusion and interrupted the flow of the show.

Goofy audience antics aside, this DVD is a must-have for Dear Hunter fans. The performances are flawless, the production is pristine and the mixing is spot-on (5.1 dolby). A great concert from a great band.",1362960000,6,2901,4.780439121756487

8562286,5,B00B4GLL0C,"The Color Spectrum album is one of the most incredible works of music I've ever heard.  But the live album, oh man, the live album... The (3 hour) live show alone would be an incredible feat for most bands, but The Dear Hunter manages to maintain impeccable musical dexterity, pitch, and tone through the entirety of the work.  The band melds so well and you can tell they genuinely love what they do.  Their talent is only matched by their appreciation for the true art of music making.

As said before me, I would recommend this to any The Dear Hunter fan, or anyone who appreciates the epitome of an incredible performance.

By the way, 5.1 surround + TDH = Mind Blown",1373068800,,671,4.467213114754099
