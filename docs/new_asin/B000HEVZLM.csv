8139448,5,B000HEVZLM,"I was so lucky to get a copy of this movie because I don't think it will be available much longer.  I watched it last night, and I loooooved it so much.  All of the actors had really great chemistry with each other.  The three wise guys were absolutely adorable together, and even though they were technically hit men, you can't help falling in love with them because they were softies at heart.  The scenes between Joey and a pregnant Mary were so funny and endearing, especially the last scene at the end.  I had happy tears in my eyes.  There are many funny and sweet moments through out this entire movie.  And there were a lot of spoofs from other Christmas stories.  The two main characters are Joey and Mary (Joseph and Mary - get it).  Her ex boyfriend was Jake Marley (Jacob Marley).  Jake was also a drummer who they referred to as the little drummer boy.  There are many other references to Christmas stories, but I'll let you guess them yourself.  What I also love about this movie is that it is so different to all of the other Christmas movies out there.  I highly recommend watching this if you want to feel good before the holidays.  Even if you can't get the DVD, then watch it on TV.  You won't regret it :-)",1382832000,,1226,4.3392070484581495

8139450,4,B000HEVZLM,What a great holiday(xmas) movie!. Not a Tom Arnold fan but he does a good job here as do Judd Nelson and Eddie McClintock (from Warehouse 13 -SYFY). Buy it you'll like it.,1367798400,,172,4.242424242424242
