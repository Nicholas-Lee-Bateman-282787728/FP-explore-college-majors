4855084,5,B005OV1N4C,"If you haven't seen this, get it now - unbelievable event.  For all music lovers, this is an underdog-succeeds story.  Can't believe the hardships these folks go thru (daily travel time) in order to get to rehearsals, let alone final performance.  Get it, watch it, over and over!  Delivered on time, no play-back issues.  Thanks!",1376006400,,330,4.927272727272728
4855085,5,B005OV1N4C,"The Congo is a place with lots of problems. I have worked there. But there is also hope, not because of the government, but because of the churches and individual citizens. This inspiring tale will show you people living on the margins and on the edge who look for transcendence even in that.",1373932800,,292,4.528301886792453
4855086,5,B005OV1N4C,"should be seen by as many people as possible. infinitely better than any ball game or computer game, let alone the poor TV programming one is offered... there are no explosions, burning cars or artistic jumps
just amazing inspiration for those who seek it",1362268800,,255,4.818181818181818
4855087,5,B005OV1N4C,"I had seen the film on TV - Al Jazeera English Channel - and as soon as it had finished I told myself that I must find a way to get a copy of it. I really got a missionary impulse.
I had no clue where to find it, I am continuously buying books from Amazon, but I had never looked for a video before. Don't have much time to spare for looking at films, work too much. However, I was lucky and I found it at the first try. I am Swedish, but living and working in Germany since a couple of years. I was going down to my house in Legnago in Italy see my twin brother and his companion who were making a short vacation there (they are retired)and my sister-in-law who is Italian and living there fixed.

I had told them that I had a video to show them, but after the dinner they just continued to chat - thats clear, we don't see each other so often. At a certain point I had to tell them to stop with their shit talk because I had some serious cultural stuff to show them on a video.
They were a bit reluctant, but after the film had ended they were without words - the film, the people, the atmosphere of this musical challenge - it took their breath away.

Mission accomplished for me, they have certainly all of them also become missioners for the Kinshasa Symphony by now.

You will love the film, you will love this Kinshasa people",1349308800,,1332,4.076335877862595
4855088,5,B005OV1N4C,If you want a blessing this is it. If you want to learn gratitude for what you have this is your lesson. If you want to be amazed by passion and ingenuity and a sense of community come visit people who live and think outside the box and make music of it.,1347580800,3,254,3.9038461538461537
4855089,5,B005OV1N4C,"Impressive, Insipirational, Moving.  What a tragedy that this wonderful group of people have to struggle so much to participate in something they have such a passion for ""Music"".",1347494400,,178,5.357142857142857
4855090,5,B005OV1N4C,"This truly remarkable documentary about the Democratic Republic of the Congo's sole symphony orchestra powerfully depicts the collective challenges facing the 16-year-old organization of amateur, mostly self-taught musicians, including: internal and external wars, widespread sexual violence, poverty, disease and famine. The filmmakers balance this overall perspective with a sharp focus on a half-dozen individual musicians whose dedicated efforts to sustain and improve their artistry while struggling to make a living are representative of all 200 members. What the film does best, however, is capture the pure, transforming joy of creating music, no matter the circumstances or setting. To their credit, the filmmakers never preach or try to manipulate the viewer's emotions; they simply let the strength and resilience and ambition of the musicians speak for itself. Their collective story is heartbreaking, eye-opening, surreal, often funny and profoundly uplifting.",1329868800,15,973,6.057971014492754

4855093,5,B005OV1N4C,"Kinshasa Symphony is an amazing film about the challenges of building one of the most complex systems in human cooperation in one of the most chaotic cities in the world - a symphonic orchestra and choir in Kinshasa, DR Congo. It is about Kinshasa and the daily lives of its people, it is about making something work with very little, it is about the joys of rehearsing and performing Beethoven's Ninth and other classical music. Anyone who has ever played in an orchestra or sung in a choir, anyone who has ever been to Africa or is interested in Africa, anyone who has faced challenges with little on hand will greatly enjoy this movie.",1319673600,21,638,4.605263157894737
4855094,5,B005OV1N4C,I love this documentary.  Talk about a group of talented people fighting the odds just to play music.  Inspirational.  And I don't use that word lightly.,1420675200,,153,4.8076923076923075

4855099,5,B005OV1N4C,"This is a fascinating DVD, even though it is in French and subtitled in English.  The French is from the interviews with members of the orchestra and the director, but the subtitles make it clear (?) what they are saying.  It gives not only a beautiful picture of the music and musicians but also a view of the poverty and violence threat in the Congo.",1400803200,,352,4.4
4855100,2,B005OV1N4C,"I loved the 60 Minutes presentation about the Kinshasa Symphony, and expected more of the same here.  But it is boring with very little storyline, and what they have, you have to read rather than hear as none is in English.",1393200000,2,223,4.439024390243903
4855101,4,B005OV1N4C,I teach middle school orchestra and have my 7th and 8th graders watch this movie.  Subtitles are not ideal but my students always find this story very interesting.  If you are abteacher I would preview as there are some adult topics discussed.,1388448000,,243,4.761904761904762
4855102,4,B005OV1N4C,"Lovely, honest story of beautiful, unusual music and the midst of adverse conditions. Only criticism is that the sound was overdubbed in places which seems unnecessary due to the honest nature of the content.",1380844800,2,208,5.147058823529412

8482043,5,B005OV1N4C,"Great and very moving documentary about the Congolese classical symphony orchestra. What a great film - more important and inspiring that dozens of Afropessimist docs about the suffering and hopelessness of the great continent. Kudos to this project. Also great for teaching both music and African studies, and globalization.",1491091200,,325,5.653061224489796

8482047,5,B005OV1N4C,"Was disappointed that it was not totally a ""hearing"" concert. But the cultural value is worth its weight in gold. It can be used to encourage others who go through loss or do not have opportunity. Making opportunity is the story of these young people who had little to work with except their own determined efforts to succeed.",1428451200,,326,4.637931034482759
8482048,5,B005OV1N4C,"Although I am not a musician myself, I love classical music, and the effort the orchestra members had to make in order to produce such beautiful music was an eye-opener.",1426636800,,169,4.666666666666667
8482049,5,B005OV1N4C,"This is an unusual film, but well worth watching if a) you want to know more about the resourcefulness of people who live in abject poverty; b) you previously lived in Congo and wanted to relive some of memories of having lived there; or, c) you appreciate music.",1423872000,,263,4.5
8482050,5,B005OV1N4C,This is an awesome story of the human spirit.  It is an amazing story of the love of music and what people will do to achieve their dreams and desires.  This story will make you feel grateful for your life if you live in the USA.,1421539200,,229,3.9565217391304346
