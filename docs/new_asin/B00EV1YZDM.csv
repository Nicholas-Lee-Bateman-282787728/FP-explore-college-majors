5944889,1,B00EV1YZDM,"I just watched a video clip of this DVD, and its another one of those motion comic CG animations, which are terrible!  I have many Marvel and DC animation DVDs, and like a lot of other animation fans I too wish they would stop releasing these motion comic CG formats, and go back to the standard animation formats such as Ultimate Avengers series, Justice League Unlimited series, and Batman/Superman animated movies.  No one seems to know why Marvel keeps pushing motion comic CG, when the prior animation format was so popular.  If any one knows, please share.  I will not buy them.",1384819200,20,584,4.696078431372549
5944890,2,B00EV1YZDM,"Heroes United was intended to be a series of made-for-video CGI-animated which takes the approach of Marvel Comics' old Team-Up and Two-In-One featuring various Avengers team-ups. This first one had the invincible Iron Man fighting with-and alongside the Incredible Hulk. It was produced through Marvel Entertainment itself, and not bothering with other studios like Disney, using a special in-house technique called 2-D Wrap which is a step up from old cell-shading, but appears choppy sometimes, especially in the facial ticks.

 Hulk fights his old enemy Abomination in a wrecked town, and is brought into HYDRA's custody to use both of the gamma-powered monsters to amp up their own personal gamma-arc reactor. This of course goes horribly wrong, giving birth to a living energy creature calling itself Zzzax. Iron Man shows up in his own personal SHIELD Helicarier(which has a bunch of fighter jets in it for some reason), and thinks Hulk is the one responsible for all the damage to the damn Hydra was using, but changes his tune when he sees Zzzax. They chase the electric beast into the Helicarrier, and blasts them out after possessing some of Stark's old suits. Awakening in an graveyard, the damaged Iron Man and blinded fight of a completely random wendigo attack! Making it back into the Helicarrier, Iron Man suits Hulk up in some Hulkbuster armor to finally smash Zzzax. The movie ends with the two HYDRA scientist responsible for making Zzzax briefing Red Skull who has plans for Iron Man and Captain America.

 The first Heroes United was decent, but seriously lacked in story content and plot. It was more of the two heroes bantering and going from one fight to another. It was released on DVD and Blu-Ray, but the sales and reviews were so negative that the sequal wasn't released for the video market at all. It makes for a reasonable watch for ol' school Marvel Zombies, but even for an ""all-ages"" feature its pretty tame.",1475193600,,1943,4.9327217125382266
5944891,2,B00EV1YZDM,"CGI animation is hit or miss. Sometimes you get a detailed, realistic tale with spellbinding visuals... and sometimes you get an uncanny-valley mess.

And this is the biggest problem behind ""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United,"" a fluffball of a Marvel animated movie that focuses on the Hulk and Iron Man teaming up to defeat a new sparky supervillain together. It has roughly the depth and tone of your average ""Avengers Assemble"" episode, but is hamstrung from being a transient pleasure by rubber-faced, dated CGI that constantly distracts from the muddled story.

The Abomination is hired by HYDRA to capture the Incredible Hulk, so that they can siphon away his gamma energy for their own dastardly purposes. Yes, apparently they can use the Hulk like a big-green battery. Except that they double-cross the Abomination and use him as a gamma-radiation battery as well -- only to cause an overload that leads to a city-wide blackout. Ah, mad science in action.

This draws the attention of Iron Man/Tony Stark, who discovers the Hulk in the ruins of the HYDRA lab and learns that something new has appeared -- an electrical life-form called Zzzax who consumes power and disrupts electronics. Unfortunately, a fight with him leaves Iron Man's suit damaged from the waist down, and the Hulk barely able to see. The only way they can stop Zzzax is to work together. Sing kumbayah, my Lord, kumbayah.

Also, there are wendigos. Do they have anything to do with the story? No. Do they have any reason to be where the heroes are? No. They just appear and attack... and are forgotten just as quickly as they were introduced.

Yeah, one of the biggest problems of ""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United"" is that it's stretching a very small plot over an hour of story, even though it's better-suited to a 22-minute TV episode. Basically, the villains catch the Hulk, things go haywire, a new villain appears, Iron Man shows up, they have to join forces, and they learn the value of teamwork and friendship while fighting the villain. That's it. THAT IS IT. HYDRA barely is even involved in the story.

Except for the wendigo cul-de-sac and a battle with mandroids, the plot doesn't have any serious obstacles or outside sources of interesting drama, so it simply stretches out every action scene to the point of tedium. For instance, the film effectively starts with the Abomination fighting the Hulk, but since there has been little buildup to the fight, the audience is given no reason to care that two CGI monsters are throwing each other around with no visible injury. And whenever the plot seems to be going too quickly, it grinds to a halt for another painfully prolonged action scene.

And of course... there is the animation, which apparently used a new process called ""2-D Wrap."" ""Advent Children,"" this is not. Sometimes its competent, where the characters look like CGI marionettes or action figures, but I cringe every time we get a glimpse inside the Iron Man armor -- Tony's face is overly smooth and rubbery, with jerky movements. And the Hulk and Abomination look overly glossy and weirdly glowy. The animation is not totally incompetent, but it does leave you wishing they had gone with a  different form of animation.

As for the characterizations, they're murky at best -- it's never entirely clear how well (if at all) the Hulk and Iron Man know each other, or what they thought of each other before this little adventure. The Hulk spends too much time talking and never even hints at his Dr. Banner persona, while Stark is presented as a character who is apparently supposed to be really clever but... isn't, really.

""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United"" stumbles on both the 2-D wrap animation and on the way-too-short-for-an-hour-long-story plotline. A passable piece of fluff for those who like Marvel adventures, but there are better stories about Iron Man and Hulk out there.",1474243200,,3888,4.859516616314199

This movie is perfect for Hulk fans, I'm guessing most of these reviews are written by people more into Iron Man (nothing wrong with that), and I can see why: Iron Man here (as he is in the similarly good Heroes United/Captain America) is very arrogant and becomes tiresome in that respect early on.

5944909,1,B00EV1YZDM,"Usually I prefer the old school style of animation, drawing or whatever you call it but I really liked this type of animation.... Computer animated I guess? It was pretty cool. I think the animation was the only good thing about this Marvel movie. The story was boring & it just felt like nothing was there. I especially HATED the corny jokes & bad 1 liners .....And when did The Hulk start talking in complete sentences?! I HATED that as well. Maybe I'm too old school but I remember when Hulk would talk in 2-4 word sentences or just growl. Iron Man & Hulk: Heroes United is worth watching just to see the animation but other than that, that's really about it",1423785600,,661,4.426229508196721
5944910,3,B00EV1YZDM,"Basically it's a one hour team up  movie with lots of interesting visuals. Sure the story is flimsy. They battle Zzzaxx, which is a villain who's a relic from the 1970's era of comics.  I was surprised there wasn't more substance to this story.  However that being said the only way I can recommend this if you are a Marvel fan  and like the team up books of the 70's.  It was good for what it's worth.  The movie is no Avengers or Iron Man.  The movies seem to be experimenting with what Marvel fans want to see in the next feature film. It's not a film that's short on action, you'll get plenty of that.....but I would wait until it reaches the $5 bin at Wal-Mart before you purchase it.",1422748800,,689,4.213740458015267

5944913,5,B00EV1YZDM,"I don't see why everyone's so negative about this DVD. Unless you're a 29 yr old dungeons and dragons freak or ""gamer""' i.e. unemployed slacker living with the 'rents, it's a great movie for 4-8 yr olds. which is the intended ausience, I believe. It's got some corny jokes, playful banter between Hulk and Iron Man and it teaches teamwork and the animation is great and the story line while not up to speed with say Cars or Frozen, for a kids action CARTOON, it's pretty darned good and you can buy it used, like new for like $8 with shipping.

And this is coming from the Dad, who grew up on Tom and Jerry which had AMAZING animation considering they were all PAINTED back then and were very realistic with shadows and nuance, who has a 4 yr old who is ALL BOY and ALL ABOUT Iron Man and he loves it!! He especially liked that Hulk and IM became sorta friends during the movie and worked together cause at one point IM can't move and Hulk can't see and he pointed out that they ""worked together"".

5944921,1,B00EV1YZDM,"First, I don't get why Hulk talks in full sentences. Of course I've watched The Avengers EMH and I know Hulk talks in full sentences there but I think this is way worse.
 Second, why is Hulk so smart? I think that's why it's different from Avengers EMH, in that Hulk still talks in full sentences, but hes not as smart as Bruce Banner. In this he is pretty smart.
 Third, why don't Hulk and Iron Man get along? In Avengers EMH the only time they didn't get along was when the Enchantress was controlling him. That makes no sense to me.
 I'm sorry that I kept making references to the Avengers EMH, but that's the only place I've seen Iron Man and Hulk together. I say you shouldn't waste your money on this, and get the Avengers EMH series instead. I think that is one of the best Marvel series of all time.",1401580800,,807,4.2272727272727275

5944923,1,B00EV1YZDM,"I'm usually pretty forgiving of most Marvel and DC animation. However this release is just plain forgettable. Plot is leaden, dialogue is painful to listen to, and the graphics look like they were developed with decade old technology.  Others have pointed out flaws and I have to agree with most and won't waste time repeating them.

This has less going for it than most Avengers cartoons released over the last decade and this effort is nowhere close to what I would consider to be a quality release for any age group.",1400198400,,519,4.6923076923076925

5944928,1,B00EV1YZDM,"There should be an option for ZERO STARS, because this ""movie"" deserves it. You know it's bad when the the best animation was the first 5 minutes, and three minutes was the title sequence. The ""animation"" is so bad that I could never watch this all the way through. There wasn't much to the story or the dialog either. The old marvel cartoons from the 70's and 80's were actually better than this. I think my 3 year old put it best: That not the Hulk. That is Jello man. Jello man is NOT the Hulk! Turn it off dad.",1393718400,2,514,4.15
5944929,1,B00EV1YZDM,"The movie was boring, and could have been a cartoon episode of the Avengers or Hulk series.  Also the advertised extras on box (specifically the mini mates offer) was over less than 90 days after movie was released.  Just a complete ripoff.  Do not purchase, and if you much see it watch on Netflix.  Horrible money grab",1393632000,2,320,4.56140350877193
5944930,4,B00EV1YZDM,"First off this movie is not like the DC animated movies. Those movies are aimed at adult audience and this Marvel movie is aimed squarely at children, which is not a bad thing.  The animation takes a minute to get used to. The best comparison I can give it is it is similar to cell shaded CGI but I didn't hate it by any means.  The dialog does have some corny jokes but it is again aimed at children. If you have seen the Ultimate Spiderman DIsney XD cartoon, it's similar to that.  The Hulk was out of character and that is my biggest complaint. I have never read a Hulk comic so I'm not sure how Hulk acts in the comics but he talks and reasons unlike the live action movie where he just smashes.  Overall it was pretty good. It's on netflix if you would rather watch it before you buy it. Also make sure to stick around after the credits as there is an extra scene setting up the next movie which apparently is going to be an Iron man and Captain America team up movie.",1393459200,3,973,4.132275132275132
5944931,1,B00EV1YZDM,"If you are a Marvel fan, stay far away from this travesty.  I don't know who made this, but they know NOTHING about these characters.

The Hulk talks like a little kid with a gravely voice.  Iron Man talks like a pre-teen.  The dialogue is literally so bad that I cringed and scowled.

Then you have the animation, which is terrible.  Slow, choppy, like an old computer's graphics card is dying.

In fact, I have to stop here.  There is so much bad about this movie that I am amazed it was released for sale.  Even children should NOT see this garbage.  It is not a true representation of Marvel's beloved characters, and it is VERY poorly done.  There are cartoons for toddlers with more gravitas and value.

Well let me tell you the biggest waste of download time i could have spent, not too mention if i actually bought this with hard earned dollars.  MARVEL needs to wake up and get their act together if they are planning to capture this segement of the market.  DC animation and story lines have been terrific.

The characters were somehow modified as if an outsider had based his narrative on how they looked and not the relationship they've developed over time. Marvel is being Disneyfied and its not always a good thing, as in this case. The perils are just ludicrous and the two stars act as if they barely knew one another. Its an unsightly bump in the road in the face of the company's drive to unify everything under a more saleable tent. I think this is what one would call ""stoner food.""

5944944,4,B00EV1YZDM,"This is an animated action thrill ride. Marvel heroes Ironman (Adrian Pasdar) and Hulk (Fred Tatasciore) battle a new villain named Zzzax (Dee Bradley Baker). However these two Characters have a long road ahead of them to become an unstoppable team.

What is very unique about this film is the animation. When an action scene happens we see fantastic effects, like the dust when a character falls. They have bright blues and reds in this and its electrifying.  The writing is comic book style, we have the hero say a witty remark then, they fight, only to say another witty remark. It brings audiences back to the good old days of comic book lines and its perfect for this setting. The characters are well established.  Whenever you get two well known characters together, you get to experience entertaining interactions.

My favorite character is Ironman  / Tony Stark (Adrian Pasdar). Hes a crime fighting, egotistical, billionaire. I enjoy Starks personality - a guy who is so full of himself and yet so likable. Plus when he has the Mark VII Iron suit on hes a powerful ally.
My favorite scene is when Hulk and Ironman battle Zzzax for the last time. This is your big ending battle that every super hero fan looks forward to. Its everything I dreamed it would be and more. Also to top it all up, Hulk wears an Ironman Suit.

The message of the story is, Two heads are better than one. Hulk and Tony don't get along at first and they don't work well together. Half the time Hulk uses Ironman as a club. Soon they learn that they need to work together to conquer villains.

I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 5-12 year olds, because the kids will enjoy the action and the funny remarks from the characters. You can call some lines corny, but to me it reminds me of the comics I know and love.

5944946,3,B00EV1YZDM,"Lots of pretty bad reviews for this movie. Could it have been better? Sure. Could it have been worse? Of course. Was it entertaining? Yes. Ever since I saw the Marvel video game cinematics on the Doctor Strange DVD bonus features, I have been waiting for a Marvel CG movie. Six years later this movie has arrived. It is not all I hoped for.

When I was a kid, comics were written for kids. When I came back to reading graphic novels 30 years later I found the stories had grown up. The plots were deeper and more thought provoking, but the action I remembered from my youth seemed sparse. This movie reminds me more of the comics I grew up with, plenty of action but short on story. The comics industry has realized their core fans are older, the animation side of the industry is slow to catch on.

All in all, this movie is not as bad as the worst reviews, and not as good as the best. It all depends on your level of maturity. CG animation, with it's shadows and highlights, has a more realistic look than traditional hand drawn animation.

5944949,2,B00EV1YZDM,"Not wanting anyone to forget about their characters in between films, Marvel unleashes the CG-animated feature ""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United."" Apparently, these two super heroes don't need the rest of the Avengers to get the job done. The great green behemoth and heavy metal warrior can take on super-villains just fine as a dysfunctional duo.

The Invincible Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk team up for the first time ever to battle an energy consuming monster named Zzzax. Neither of these super heroes can take on this tremendous threat alone. With the fate of the planet at stake, they must combine forces and set aside their differences to save the world.

There's enough action and adventure found in ""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United"" to keep children happy. However, if you move past the slamming and banging and look at animation quality, you can forget it. This is more of the same shoddy CG work that anyone with any sort of viewing standards would shut off. It's a step above the crappy ""Iron Man: Armored Adventures"" CG, but that's not saying much.

""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United"" is presented in 1080p High Definition Widescreen (1.78:1). The video looks as good as it can with what it has to work with. The clarity of the picture does nothing but highlight just how lame the CG animation is.

A DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround mix at least gives viewers something good to hear while watching ""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United."" There are plenty of opportunities to have your eardrums rattled with explosions and other chaotic noises. It will no doubt shake the pictures on the walls if turned up to loud.

""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United"" contains a few special features. Ryan Penagos (Agent M) and Marvel's Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada discuss great team-ups in a short featurette. ""Marvel Mash-Ups"" provide fresh takes on some of the publisher's greatest super heroes. Marvel ""Inter-Missions"" give viewers a new twist on retro characters.

Kids will no doubt enjoy ""Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United"" for what it is. Their parents will cringe as they are forced to sit through more second rate CG animation that borders on unbearable. Marvel accomplished what they set out to do in the end. They created something else for the younger fans to bug their parents to buy for them. For my Marvel fix, I'll stick with the ""Ultimate Avengers"" animated movies.",1389830400,3,2388,4.82640586797066

Then it started to go in an odd direction with an energy creature and even had a bit of a public service announcement about our use of energy. Not quite Godzilla and the Smog Monster message, but felt something like it. The movie is only little over an hour but it felt a lot longer because the story started to drag...and drag...and drag. Maybe if I watched it at 2x speed, I might have enjoyed it a bit better.

The one thing I find sorta annoying is that still treat the Hulk like a mindless smashing machine, not that Bruce Banner is still part of him and that part of his intelligence is there. I'm getting used to it though.

Unlike the DC Animated movies where they seem to change the voices with each movie, they used the voices from Avengers Assemble. Nice move.

All in all...the story is straight forward, they try a bit too hard with the Tony Stark humor, and the animation is so-so.

Marvel, I love you. When it comes to Marvel vs. DC, I've always been Marvel, all the way, for the past 35 years. The stories, the characters -- I've always thought Marvel excelled.

And THAT's why video releases like these bum me out SO MUCH. DC is absolutely mopping the floor with Marvel in the direct video department. How DC can release two or three videos a year, each of which far surpass Marvel's one offering every 12-18  months is beyond me. In story and craftsmanship, DC is winning in this market hand down.

And even when I do like them I don't want to own them because my concert DVD collection takes up all the reasonable space I can give it at  home.

The storyline, if a tad weak, is effective and provides what's necessary for a super-violent display of engaging action scenes. If it's a complicated plot you're looking for, look elswhere. It is indeed videogame-oriented, which as a 52-year old videogame-hater I don't find appealing enough, but it didn't exactly ruined my experience. Adrian Pasdar is not given enough credit for IMan's voice, but I think we're now all spoiled rotten by Robert Downey's and let's face it, how expensive would have been to hire him for the dubbing ?!

Picture is fantastic, almost 3Dish with impeccable CGI effects. The sound, OAH, was just ok, with upper treble not as exaggerated as other movies (my ears are thankful) and the bottom end was weak ( had to turn my sub to the max)

5944989,4,B00EV1YZDM,"Full review at Metal Arcade .Net

Everyone loved watching The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man share the screen in last years The Avengers. Marvel has teamed the unlikely allies up once more for Iron Man And Hulk: Heroes United, a computer-generated film that sees the pair fighting against a new enemy known as Zzzax  an energy being born of gamma radiation siphoned from Hulk and his nemesis the Abomination. Zzzax threatens to drain all of the Earths electricity, and Tony Stark and Hulk will have to use their combined strength and intellect to try and stop him. Their adventure will see them face down rabid Wendigos, HYDRA robots and more  fans will even get to see Hulk don some armor of his own.

Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United is a solid side-story, featuring plenty of action and decent humor. I found it a bit strange that Hulk can put together full sentences in this film, as Im so used to seeing the blind rage version of the character. Watching Hulk and Abomination engage in lengthy conversations while pummeling each other was just plain odd at first, but I got used to it after a while; funnily enough, new villain Zzzax talks like classic Hulk. The overall story here is light, seeing some HYDRA scientists unwittingly creating big bad Zzzax, and our two heroes duking it out over a misunderstanding before putting aside their differences to stop this imminent threat. Zzzax is becoming more powerful by the minute as he feeds on the planets energy, and he cant be harmed by Hulks giant fists or Iron Mans repulsor beams. Its a relatively interesting setup that had me pondering how the pair would eventually take him down, and theres a few great fight sequences before the credits roll, including a standout nighttime graveyard battle between a blinded Hulk and some vicious Wendigos.

The extras on the Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United Blu-ray were possibly my favorite part of the package. There are a lot of Marvel Mash-ups on the disk, which are utterly hilarious shorts where voice actors overdub scenes from the old Marvel cartoons. There are three of these in the extras section, but if you pause the film youll access even more of them in the hidden Marvel Inter-missions. Theres one other bonus feature, an interesting conversation between Marvels Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada and Ryan Penagos (Agent M on Twitter) about Iron Man and Hulks shared history, as well as Wolverine and Spider-Mans time in the New Avengers.

Overall, I came away impressed by Iron Man and Hulk: Heroes United, and I hope Marvel creates more of these stand-alone features. While I would have liked to see at least a little of David Banner, and eloquent Hulk never quite sat right with me, as a whole this film is a success. The bonus features and included digital copy and DVD make this a compelling purchase for Marvel fans, and a great stocking stuffer for Christmas.",1385164800,11,2878,4.769076305220883
