8470717,5,B004K9T36Y,"This is a very well made video showing the first four kata of the Hakatsuru White Crane system.  For anyone who studies Okinawan karate of any style, this is a great look at the origins of the art, as a link between Okinawan karate and its Chinese kung-fu origins.  As with his other videos, Vellucci does an excellent job of explaining the kata, and the multiple angles make it very easy to learn the forms.  I would love to see further material on this style from Vellucci.",1312416000,,475,4.436781609195402
