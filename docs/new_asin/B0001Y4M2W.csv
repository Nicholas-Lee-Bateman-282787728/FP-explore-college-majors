Maybe I'm doing something wrong but even on the box I see no mention of subtitles so unless you're fluent in Spanish, forget this.

Having said that the clips of game action are fantastic and make me wonder why the Mexican League doesn't get better PR.",1324425600,,427,4.605263157894737
8018252,4,B0001Y4M2W,"Its a good documentary, but i did not gave it five stars because the last cup disputed is not recorded and i felt the dvd has some ""gaps"" in it. Never the less it is a great dvd to watch and learn some stuff about the best mexican team in history!!!

If you are a fan this is a Must Have, and if you are no fan of sports, or soccer this is a good oportunity to see why some of us go crazy every time we see a game, you can say that you will feel and get to see ""what lies under this club"" and what makes passion come around.",1132963200,3,524,3.6785714285714284
