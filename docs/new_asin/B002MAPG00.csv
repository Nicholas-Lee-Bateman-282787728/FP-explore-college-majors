I love the surrealism which surrounds this movie. The actors are all fantastic and I applaud the bold choice for the acting to be done theatrically - meaning, the acting style is that of the theatre (full of projection, exaggerated motions) which was unique and worked well with this subject matter. Gabriel Damon as the young Strindberg really stood out, he captured the bullheaded arrogance of the Victorian anti-feminist man. The actor who played the adult Strindberg was great as well, he really captured the remorse of a man who has lost everything. Clint Howard is a pleasure in any role I loved his slightly gleeful turn as a sympathetic Ibsen. I highly recommend this movie, it's definitely one of the best indie films I've ever seen!",1401840000,,879,4.714285714285714

8403172,4,B002MAPG00,I thought this was a good movie. Both main characters were very well played.  It was very moving as you really get caught up in this mans agony.  I cried.,1371168000,,154,4.1
8403173,1,B002MAPG00,"I was drawn in by the title and encouraged by the positive reviews. I gave it a chance with reasonably high expectations. Ibsen is a virtuoso among playwrights and A Doll's House is his masterpiece. However, this film does not do justice to his genius. It is poorly written, acted, and directed. If you are not familiar with Ibsen's works, this is a horrible introduction. The film enacts two differently caste versions of A Doll's House, within the story of August Strindberg being trapped in the play that he despises.

Both of the female leads seem as if they would be better suited to daytime television. Strindberg is portrayed as one-dimensionally evil and the representation of him in this film is often historically inaccurate (although his hair was really that crazy looking a hundred years before Wayne Static decided to copy his do). The plot is simply too narrow to support a film. Perhaps it might have worked as a short film, if it had better casting.

The moral and life changing messages other reviewers have raved about are better conveyed in unadulterated versions of A Dolls House.

However there are numerous other versions and they are all out of this movie's league.

8403174,1,B002MAPG00,Sorry no review cause I never got around to watching it. It might be a good film so don't take my star rating seriously.,1316736000,,120,4.041666666666667
8403175,5,B002MAPG00,"This is one of those movies that when you look at the cover art and title you think its another boring, movie that's too long and not exciting...OKAY! This movie is INCREDIBLE!...I've seen it 3 times!...Reason being that I didn't know I'd like a movie from this genre, and the subject had me wondering about how many people (guys) today  STILL have this MENTAL way of thinking.  This character August Strindberg still didn't realize he was his own self's worst enemy...till the end he still found ways to blame his wife and others for his karma and when he was alone with his haunted thoughts he would make excuses as to why they were that way...somebody else is to blame!...he was a man...untouchable to riducule and weakness!...and even after the wake up call(his wife left him) he still refused to admit failure on his part...Sad and pathetic! but  mind blowing at the same time...The actors in the film are UNDERRATED...THEY are by far some of the BEST IN CHARACTER ACTING THAT IVE SEEN IN A WHILE...Who knew Gabriel Damon had this kind of range?!...and the others...SUPERB in they're art...This film is one that is tops in its genre...and should be MANDATORY viewing for ALL FILM SCHOOLS...to teach them the WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE!I also admire the way the female strength is shown...bold in speech and thought...slow and steady in action...and the way it showed that IT MAY BE A MAN'S WORLD...BUT ITS NOTHING WITHOUT A WOMEN IN IT and it took NORA/SIRI to leave to let Strindberg know that!...I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE! and the subtle comedy, of Clint Howard is the best...especially when out of nowhere he takes a piece of danish...lol...and then the wine, LMAO!!! One of my favorite lines in the movie is when young Strindberg(Gabe Damon) is taunting Siri in the cage...Elder Strindberg(Steve DuMouchel) tells Ibsen(Clint Howard) to make him stop...Ibsen replies ""I DID NOT WRITE YOUR LIFE""...LUV'S IT!",1301529600,,1908,4.882716049382716
8403176,5,B002MAPG00,"Planet Ibsen is unique and creative in so many ways as it examines and explores the rivalry between Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen and his Swedish counterpart August Strindberg. In Planet Ibsen, Jonathan Wyche takes a surrealist approach to the Victorian era, as it speaks to a wide range of audiences by bringing family and marital relationships to the forefront. You will find yourself questioning your life decisions and their impact on your life and those around you...similar to what August Strindberg does in this moving and intellectually stimulating film.  This is such a great piece of film...and a shame that it did not get the wider audience that it so richly deserved.  For those that love great film-making....this is a solid choice.",1270166400,2,749,5.131147540983607
8403177,5,B002MAPG00,"This is an amazing film!  I find it hard pressed to find anyone who
would not see how well done this movie is.  Most independent films
that get hype these days I find disappointing, and are more about
marketing than filmmaking, but not this one.  I strongly recommend
this to people who like Gillaim and Spike Jones types of films.  You
see that there's a director with a unique vision and the actors give
great performances.  Anyone who'd give this film one star is
crazy...!!!  This film takes chances and it should be recognized for
that.  I'd strongly recommend this to people who want to see a truly
independent film that works on all levels and have half a brain.

The unfortunate truth is a film like Planet Ibsen, dollar for dollar
is more impressive that most films I see come out of Hollywood, but
like most true independents they never seem to get the attention they
truly deserve.",1269388800,2,892,4.566037735849057
