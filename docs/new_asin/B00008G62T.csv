Even if the quality of the images were better, the events captured will bore you to tears. This disk is endless video clips of average street cars drag racing on a puplic street. There are no exceptional vehicles or races and no action. My 80 year old mother would not find riding in one of those cars exciting.

What a ripoff!!!!!!!!",1204502400,2,426,4.2592592592592595
