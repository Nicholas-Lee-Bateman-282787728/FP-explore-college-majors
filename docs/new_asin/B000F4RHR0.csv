2551181,1,B000F4RHR0,"This was one of the dumbest, slowest and most boring stories I've ever suffered through.  The story was flat.  Elfin's character was a partial nutcase.  The mom was weird.  Even the hospital didn't function properly (big light explosions during a power outages). Gimme a break.

I rented this movie for $1.79.  The video store owes me $1.78.",1157241600,,341,4.894736842105263
2551182,4,B000F4RHR0,"Okay, I admit it, 'Touched' released in '05 plays like a Hallmark classic even though it isn't. It is unquestionably a chick flick so be forwarned. Just remember, fair is fair, guys have to give in once in a while and watch something our wives or girlfriends want to see. Fortunately it does star the very attractive Jenna Elfman and I can't think of any male who doesn't like her.

Plot: Recently separated Father and son are hit by an oncoming car. The son dies and the Father (Randall Batinkoff) falls into a coma for the next two years. Nurse Angela Martin (Jenna Elfman) takes care of him during that time until he unexpectedly awakens. OK, we all know the basic storyline from here on, don't we?

Anyway good production values, attractive cast and just a good film all around. Make your wife or girlfriend happy and give it a shot, the women will absolutely adore Randall Batinkoff and the rest of us can appreciate Jenna. So be tough, suck it up and be a man. If you run into any problems during the viewing follow these simple instructions: One, Two, Three, Breathe - One, Two, Three, Breathe - One, Two...",1153612800,20,1114,4.537313432835821
2551203,4,B000F4RHR0,Watched this movie as a Jenna fan.  Interesting story - a strong mixture of sadness and growing love between two people.  What I found amazing was the number of scenes with minimal dialog that none the less conveyed an element of the plot.  Also amazing was how Angela (Jenna) was not a basket case with all that she was dealing with.  Makes a good case for keeping the faith - there is always hope.,1402963200,,399,4.351351351351352
2551204,4,B000F4RHR0,"love this movie, watched it a while back couldn't find it anywhere and found it here so happy i could watch it again",1389139200,,116,4.086956521739131
2551205,5,B000F4RHR0,An awesome movie.  I was mesmerized.  I saw it on television and had to buy it to watch over and over and have shared it with friends.,1387152000,,134,3.925925925925926
2551206,1,B000F4RHR0,A friend had highly recommended the movie so I decided to purchase it.  I was completely disappointed.  It just droned on and on and didn't seem to know when to stop.,1384646400,,166,4.32258064516129
2551207,5,B000F4RHR0,Touching Movie! My friend and I are Very Happy with the Film; we watch it often! It is a Wonderful Touching Film!,1374883200,,113,4.181818181818182
2551208,4,B000F4RHR0,"A ""small"" movie well worth watching. Good acting all around, especially by Jenna. At my age I appreciate films that make me feel like it's worth being alive, in spite of all the losses.",1368489600,,185,4.470588235294118
2551209,4,B000F4RHR0,"Loved this movie! The characters were deep, well-developed and it was a very emotional story. I really got into the movie.. so much that I even purchased music featured in the movie by Maria Mena.",1368057600,,196,4.628571428571429
2551210,5,B000F4RHR0,I had to get this movie I like it a lot to watch with my mother and myself and like really like it,1362614400,,98,3.3043478260869565
2551211,5,B000F4RHR0,"great chick flick.  Yea some guys hate these types of movies but this one had a great cast and didn't drag on too much.  lots of great actors both the female lead and the male lead were quite attractive so its a win win for the guy to watch with his girl. both get to look at a nice looking actor.
Overall a great story line.  Not a really believable one but one that anyone who is in this type of situation would wish for.
So go on and give it a try.  I think its pretty good for the kind of film it is.",1343347200,,504,3.7714285714285714
2551212,4,B000F4RHR0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was slow-moving, but that wasn't necessary a negative to me.  The main characters had great chemistry, and the story was very emotional.  Was it 100% realistic?  Probably not, but that's not what makes me like or dislike a move.  I believe movies, in general, should be enjoyable, not necessarily educational.  There are lots of people out there who might comment that this is unrealistic but are perfectly happy to watch science fiction.  The only negative for me was that I thought it ended a little too abruptly.  I would have liked to have seen a more lengthy and satisfying ending.",1331424000,,623,4.811320754716981
2551223,4,B000F4RHR0,"Okay, Okay, I guess I can appreciate the negative reviews about underdeveloped storyline, and I also would have liked to see that moment that makes all of us who like chic flicks sit on the edge of our seats. However, I thought that Jenna and the actor have great chemistry and a definite emotional connection throughout that cannot be denied. I often get sick of all of the impulsive sex-scenes in movies before the deeper emotional connection is ever developed, so I appreciated a change of pace in this movie.

I realize that there were some bizarre, possibly unrealistic events that occurred that may discourage some people from feeling the authenticity of the storyline. I personally experienced a loss of a son, but also the resuscitation of my other son (against all odds), so I was drawn into the emotional turmoil of the father's loss, but could believe the ending without seeing it as too far-fetched. Miracles do happen every day and this movie can remind us of that. If you are in the mood for a movie with an emotional pull, even if not a fast-paced or romantic comedy, this is it. Though I would have liked to see a better romantic finale (after the ultimate finale, of course).",1309132800,,1192,4.6761904761904765
2551224,5,B000F4RHR0,I enjoyed this movie years ago before it was available on dvd. I'm thrilled to be able to have a copy.,1239753600,,102,3.9047619047619047
2551225,1,B000F4RHR0,"Awful, awful, awful. Slow drama that tries to be a tear jerker! The only crying I wanted to do was that I bought it to watch! The acting is atrocious and the story line is just plain stupid! I can't recommend this movie to anyone.

A nurse who has had a hard life gets involved with one of her patients after he wakes from his coma of several years. He has a hard time living in the present and especially with out his son who was killed in the same auto accident that caused him to be in coma. Really, the story takes a downward turn as soon as he comes from coma and never gets any better.",1205280000,,591,4.008474576271187
2551226,4,B000F4RHR0,"I could see how some people didn't LOVE this movie, but I on the other hand liked it a lot. Just when you thought it couldn't get any sadder it did, and than it was hopeful. It's an inspiring movie to give hope to people whose life is thought to be over, and useless, but just when you think there's no hope in life, there is, love. I personally like the message it sends, I also like Jenna's quirky but genuine performance. The actor seemed a bit off sometimes, but I want to think this was on purpose, to make the audience feel the pain that he endured.",1193097600,,555,4.148148148148148
2551227,5,B000F4RHR0,"I am a John Wayne fan who actually enjoys 'chick flicks' but I like some humor...This film is very dark and slow moving but I found it tremendously inspirational and spiritual..It shows the power to be found in unselfish love..and has a very powerful ending...I just sat in silence for half an hour after it was over, just thinking about life, death, love, etc..and all of the implications..One must be in the right mood to enjoy it was fortunately I was...I have always loved Jenna Elfman's comedy, but this lady has real range...",1168300800,2,531,4.720430107526882
2551228,1,B000F4RHR0,"The movie sounded good when I read the back, but my friend and I just got done looking at each other saying that it was the worst movie we have ever seen, ever, hands down!  Slow plot, undeveloped characters, just kind of painful.  I REALLY wanted to this to be good because the idea of the plot sounded like it could have made a good movie.  Sorry to say, it was quite bad.  I normally don't review movies, but I hope you got to read this review before you lose 90+ minutes of your time.",1165622400,,488,4.105263157894737
2551229,3,B000F4RHR0,"My wife rented this movie tonight, and from the cover I had second thoughts. But then, I have had my pick of bad movies from time to time. I wouldn't say it was a bad movie, but I agree with the other reviewers that it was slow, sad and very dark (people just refused to turn on the light on this movie).

I've always found Jenna Elfman to be a cutie, so it was well worth the 90 minutes. Mr Batinkoff is good looking and the acting was very good in my opinion. The music was also very good. Being a father of a three year old boy, who I love unconditionally, I could easily relate as to how a father would feel having lost his son.

For a slow night, I think this movie is worth the rental. If anyone is to blame, it could be the director, for not advancing the plot faster and by choosing a ""low light"" ambiance to the movie.",1163289600,2,827,4.006060606060606
2551230,2,B000F4RHR0,"This is a truly bad movie, and only rates two stars because Jenna Elfman is, admittedly, adorable.  The characters are one-dimensional, the medical events completely implausible, and the action painfully slow. I hope I am not disclosing too much by stating that those who remember ""ET"" will find themselves wondering if there are grounds for a lawsuit......

The premise of the movie is not a bad one, nor are the actors, and with better writing and editing, it could have been half decent. I feel sorry for the actors.  As they watched the final outcome, they must have cringed.",1160265600,5,579,4.828282828282828
2551231,3,B000F4RHR0,"I enjoyed this movie and thought Jenna Elfman did a wonderful job.  The actor who played Scott was absolutely gorgeous and I would have liked to have see more of him in the movie actually.  This movie was very slow and dark (dark lighting)and I was waiting for it to brighten up once things got better but the scenes continued to be darkish. Perhaps because the story was a bit depressed and sad?  I was anxious for a first kiss or first love scene or an ""I love you"" because the slowness of the movie really gives you a chance to see the characters falling in love with eachother.  I was a bit dissapointed with what we ended up with.  Overall I liked this movie but I think it could have had a few changes to it.",1159574400,2,714,4.182481751824818
2551232,4,B000F4RHR0,"Sure, there's some Hollywood-ness to this movie.  The whole waking-up-from-a-coma topic is improbable at best, but it's also of a theme that all of us hope and dream for, and presented quite effectively by a very attractive cast.  Nice chemistry between Elfman and Batinkoff, too.

My boyfriend was in a horrendous accident and in a coma for 3 days before awakening, not nearly so dramatically as portrayed in this movie, but just as emotionally, so I have a certain affinity for what these characters go through.

It's a lovely and well meaning little movie with flawed and imperfect characters and a message of love and hope.",1157328000,10,627,4.886792452830188
