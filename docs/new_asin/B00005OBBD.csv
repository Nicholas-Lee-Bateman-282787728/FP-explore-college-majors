1640746,5,B00005OBBD,"Bottom line first:  This is a must-read book, among the best to be found.

I actually saw the film on DVD first.  I found it one day more than a year ago while surfing for some information on sailing.  It looked interesting, and I have a large DVD collection, so I added one more.  But it was much more than I imagined, so good, in fact, that I bought the book, which was even better.  I've read and re-read it many times, and I show the DVD to any friends who will sit and watch.  I was actually so compelled by it that I sought Martin's email address and began a correspondence with him.

In November of 2004, had the opportunity to travel to Australia and Papua New Guinea to meet Jesse and all of his family.  They are, each and every one, the nicest people I've ever met.  My assessment of Jesse is that while he may have peers, there is no finer person on the planet!  That may sound pompous or even ridiculous, but I stand by the remark emphatically.

Everyone, young or old, should read Jesse's book, see his video, and watch for more coming in the future.  ""Lionheart"" is by no means Jese's first or last adventure.  I've read a draft of his upcoming book, which is yet another winner.  He's so down-to-earth and real, I think he's unable to write a clunker!  They're all great... I've ordered copies to donate to my local library!",1106006400,12,1340,4.321285140562249
1640747,5,B00005OBBD,"If you like reading about adventure/nature , this is the book for you. Jesse's is a very talented man and he should be a source of inspiration for all of us. This is my favorite book in the entire world and i can't wait to read the new book. :)",1097020800,,244,3.9
1640748,4,B00005OBBD,"We happened upon this film on satellite TV recently and were captivated. Jesse Martin, the Australian who at age 17 set out to become the youngest person to sail around the world alone, does not appear to be an extraordinary teen-ager. Yet he displayed a wisdom and poise that was truly remarkable as he embraced the challenge. This short documentary combines interviews after the journey with footage shot by Jesse with his onboard camera. There is great beauty in his footage (dolphins, whales, Cape Horn, etc.), tedium (no wind), humor and delight (Jesse playing the guitar and singing, reminding one a lot of Tim Robbins in ""Bull Durham""), typical teenage grumblings at little things going wrong, and lots of footage of the power of the ocean against a small sail-boat. In a gut-wrenching scene toward the end of his journey, Jesse is battling one storm after another, experiencing terrifying knock-downs, and he is seen on camera shivering uncontrollably from the extreme cold and his being soaked through to the skin with no way to get dry and warm. It was clear from the accompanying interview that Jesse knew he was facing death that day and his breakdown on camera is unforgettable. His tumultous welcome home by 25,000 people at the end of the journey was well deserved.

This is a remarkable story of the strength of the human spirit. Highly recommended.",1094169600,9,1365,4.909090909090909
1640749,5,B00005OBBD,"On the first day of school, back in 1994. Jesse told me how he'd always wanted to sail around the world.

He used to read books about Kaye Cottee, and he sailed with his father Kon and his brother Beau to the tip of Cape York in Australia, I think it was later on in that year. He was always quiet, good at basketball. You knew he would do great things. That was 10 years ago. And he still follows his dreams. I haven't seen him for years, but I'm still a great fan of his. This documentary is amazing. It taught me a lot about the will to soldier on. His strength is phenomenal. His character is 10 times bigger than he is physically.

I really strongly recommend that you watch this. And learn about a guy, that I know (knew maybe), just a regular person, doing extraordinary things, inspiring others to dream, to succeed.",1093564800,4,824,4.2756410256410255
1640750,4,B00005OBBD,"Jesse Martin is a phenominal young man, and his story is a wonderful tribute to the enduring human spirit.  Filled with insightful moments, fear, and utter frustration, Jesse forges on to attain his dream.  If you need a lift, this is a great DVD!

1640773,2,B00005OBBD,"I found the film to be long on interviews about Jesse Martin and short on the actual sailing of the craft, though there were at times some fine shots of the dolphins accompanying Jesse on this adventure.",1350086400,,203,4.513513513513513

1640775,3,B00005OBBD,"I've always wanted to sail around the world ever since Robin Lee Graham did it in 1965.  All though, I never did this movie comes close to what I always dreamed.  The freedom to get on a boat and sail away; but I was disappointed that he never stops to enjoy the world he just sailed.",1315958400,,284,4.053571428571429
1640776,4,B00005OBBD,"I live in Melbourne as does Jesse Martin but have never meet him, when he started out on his journey I totally wasn't aware of his endeavor nor when Jesse returned I can't say I remember much about it, I guess it would have been a news item both TV and Newspapers but I suppose I was caught up in my own affairs at the time. Well here we are many years later and I'm writing a 'short' review on his film.

One thing...I wouldn't be here at all if it wasn't for the courage's spirit of Jessica Watson currently 46 days at sea in the South Pacific out to ""smash"" Jess Martin's record, because of the attention Jessica had gained leading up to her departure from Sydney and the fact she is only 16 seems to have caught the eye of many people right around the world, as a result and because of a one on one interview aboard her boat ""Ella's Pink Lady"" with Jess Martin I went looking for the Book and the DVD on Jesse Martin - Lionheart

I viewed the Film first before reading the book, the film takes you on board with Jess it places you directly in the path of what Jess experienced. The Film is broken up with short interviews with Jess well after his journey including cuts to other people involved with his preparation, parents, sponsors, friends. Jess had a number of knock downs during severe storms which was evident but I felt more footage of stormy seas could have been recorded or if recorded it would have been interesting to have placed some more of that footage in the final production, to see how large those waves can get and the way Lionheart was being tossed around and even knocked over would've made for some great footage but sadly we don't see enough of this before we cut away to an interview with some one, but apart from that Jess's 70 minute doco puts you in the drivers seat and makes you realize how very brave and sure these individuals are to take on the open sea for months on end...amazing.

1640777,5,B00005OBBD,This is a fantastic story of a dream fulfilled by a young man with a wonderful and honest personality.  It recounts the good times as well as the bad.  His honest account of those bad times reveal that Jesse truly does have the courage of a lion. He is truly remarkable.,1259539200,,270,4.2745098039215685
1640778,5,B00005OBBD,Really good inspiring story.  I have watched this a few times now and it really just gives a you a feeling inside that hard to describe.

1640779,5,B00005OBBD,"My Wife & I purchased the Lionheart DVD after reading the book of the same name.

What a fantastic documentary! The film was put together very well, using footage taken from the trip by Jesse, then linked with post-trip interviews. The result was a film that was powerful in its message, as well as being very moving and inspiring.

Buy this DVD - it WILL change how you view the world and the opportunities you have within it.",1186876800,,427,4.461538461538462

I look forward to what I hope will be both an adventure and an educational experience with ""Lionheart"".",1389830400,,190,4.135135135135135
7948558,3,B00005OBBD,"I found this DVD very disappointing. Jesse's story (sailing solo non stop and unassisted around the world) is obviously great but unfortunately, the movie is mediocre.
I don't know if it is the director's or Jesse's fault but there are far too many shots of Jesse looking and talking straight into the camera and too few shots of actual sailing and I found the whole thing very frustrating. In the beginning, you see short scenes of Jesse sailing his boat alternating with scenes shot in a huge discotheque and the latter is not what you want to see in a movie about sailing.
At another time, he raves on how the sea looks great around him instead of actually filming the sea! I found this infuriating!
There are a few great scenes, for example when he struggles with his mainsail in a storm but these scenes are few and far between.
Also, what is missing is a map of his voyage.
If you want to see really good sailing dvds, watch ""Moitessier, itinraire d'un marin de lgende"" avalable on amazon.fr but it is in French and ""Le voyage de Damien"" also available on amazon.fr (in this one you can choose to view the movie in English).",1378684800,2,1130,4.490291262135922
