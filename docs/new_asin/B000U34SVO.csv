8212024,2,B000U34SVO,"This was probably made with a cheaper mini DV camcorder. There's this famous rock star who's a werewolf. He chases this girl who somehow just passes out in the woods. When she wakes up, she finds the guy lying naked near her. He wakes up and confronts her, and she knows his name. Since he doesn't want her to tell anyone about him awaking naked near her, he kidnaps her and holds her hostage for awhile. He eventually lets her go, and this doesn't really change the slow pace to this SOV movie with only a very limited amount of exploitation. About an hour into the film, he kills a lady and dog off-screen with only the dog remains being shown. During the last 15 minutes, there's a couple of bloody kills. You finally get a really quick look at this werewolf, which is just a big dog; before that, you only get to see some teeth and jaws. The acting is poor, but the directing is OK. You get to see some cheesy music videos, no interesting scenery or effective atmosphere, and there's no nudity with people having sex with their clothes on. Despite having a lot of problems, it did hold my attention at times with its story, but it's too slow and needs more exploitation. I'll give it about two and a half stars.

I just recently watched the DVD again, and the quality was better than what I remember; I made an error when I first did this review and said the quality wasn't too good. When I first saw it, I must have been watching it on my old TV that was breaking down. The quality is good, but I still had trouble watching it again because it's too slow. There's behind the scenes, interview, outtakes, photo reel, soundtrack and trailers for extras.",1425427200,,1656,4.376623376623376
8212025,2,B000U34SVO,"Like another review(er) before me, I mention the tag line on the box describing a movie that will bring werewolf movies back with a vengeance.  Like the review before me, I ask, ""Where is this movie.""  I was hoping it would be in the box with the certified promise on the front, but my search must continue.

The premise of the movie is OK, there are some good ideas presented.  However the execution was horridly poor and werewolf movies were executed with it.  I fear that the days of a good monster werewolf movie are gone and this is just another nail in that coffin.

I also ask, ""Why do such crummy movies have such cool box art and then not deliver?""  Oh yeah, sales...

Please sell me a good movie.",1214956800,,706,4.33587786259542
8212026,2,B000U34SVO,"""Werewolf films are back with a vengeance"" the cover says, well, if they are, this movie is definitely not the film that proves this fact.
It's been no secret that the Werewolf genre of Horror films has been suffering from a huge dose of bad movies for over a decade, and while you'd like to applaud the film makers on their effort alone, it simply was not enough to save the movie. The plot of the movie involves a ""cursed"" rock star who's struggling with his need to satisfy his ""blood lust"" while trying to avoid his shady ex manager. While at least they acknowledge the struggle of the curse, they simply don't deliver convincing characters.

That brings us to ""the Creature"" itself. The title alone doesn't refer to a Werewolf and that probably should've been enough to tip you off right away, but despite some fangs, lee press on nails and a 5 o'clock shadow, you're in for a major dissapointment if you were expecting a good transformation.

Overall, you can't really fault the filmmakers or the actors that much, the film is low budget and I guess they did the best they could with what they had.

All we can do is wait patiently for 'The Wolf Man' 2009 remake to really prove that ""Werewolf films are back with a vengeance"", because this certainly does not.",1207440000,,1266,4.543859649122807
