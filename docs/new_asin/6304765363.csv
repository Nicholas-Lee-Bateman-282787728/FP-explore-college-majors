928949,3,6304765363,"This movie, a sequel to the original box-office smash,  is a wonderful treat for those of us who marveled at Steve Reeves and his awesome presence in a series of otherwise forgettable 1960s sword and sorcery adventures. Reeves, a former Mr. America and Mr. Universe, was absolutely stunningly handsome, and as a result became the perfect archetype for young pubescent males looking for a role model. While his wonderful baritone voice was dubbed (much later I heard him talk on ""Entertainment Tonight"" about the newer types of bodybuilders coming to the fore under the influence of steroids, and he squawked out an answer in a tinny little voice that made one instantly realize why he never achieved wider stardom in more diverse American films.
But he was all beef and brawn here, and with the magic of a well-dubbed vocal effort became the star of the decade. This, like the original, was a continuation of his first role, as the immortal Hercules, and here again Reeves plays the part well. As someone who saw both movies dozens of times in the theaters, believe me, it was all Reeves that explained the hit movies and the string of successors that followed. Of course, film producer Joseph E. Levine threw in the lovely Sylvia Koscina and a veteran cast of character actors. The special effects are a bit dated, and the sets are nice, but any chance to watch Reeves going through the motions is an exercise in watching someone so handsome and so well built that none of the rest of it mattered. Not a great movie, but one that is fun to watch to remember way back when....Enjoy!",1033430400,35,1582,4.690647482014389
928950,5,6304765363,"We're not talking quality films. This was made in Italy and dubbed. It wasn't the plot,special effects,music or whatever it takes to sell tickets,..this was popular because of Steve Reeves.
This was at a time when there wasn't stunt doubles. He dislocated his shoulder when the chariot rolled over during a chase. He slammed his shoulder into a tree and popped it back into place. It wasn't glitz, Reeves was the REAL DEAL!",1016323200,30,423,4.808219178082192

Most people today would probably consider this movie hokey (sp.?), but I still enjoy it. The transfer of both video and sound aren't bad considering the age of the movie.

Hercules is from Thebes which is in turmoil. The ruler has just died and his two sons are fighting over rulership which is placing the Thebans in jeopardy from outside forces. Hercules is taking a message from one brother to the other when he gets sidetracked. Watch the movie to find out why and how. It's a chance to get away from the world of today for an hour or two!

His sons are feuding for the kingdom and Hercules must br ing about  truce between the brothers or risk civil war. He is accompanied by his protege , Ulysses, who will become the great Greek mastermind during the Trojan War. Again, sources of various myths are used with annoying disregard for time and context.

The aspect ratio is pretty close to the original 2:35-1 specifications, so it looks better than all of the other transfers of this film.  This disc is in PAL by the way, so you'll need a multi-standard DVD player to watch it in the US.  The color, however, is overly dark.  If you're familiar with Mario Bava's acclaimed use of color in his films, you'll realize that this German transfer was taken from a somewhat dark 35MM print.  We still need a properly letterboxed version of this film that better reflects Mario Bava's eye-popping colors.

929581,4,6304765363,"This movie opens with a confusing scene where a woman brings a man into her domicile, and shortly thereafter the young man who was there meets his end.  Okay, what the heck was that all about?  Next we see Hercules (Steve Reeves, who was the best of all the actors playing Hercules in the 1950's and 1960's), Ulysses (Gabriele Antonini), and Iole (Sylva Koscina) arriving on land as they journey home to Thebes.  Shortly thereafter the trio encounters Antaeus (Primo Carnera), a half-god giant who appears to enjoy either killing people or snacking on them.  Antaeus is another moment of confusion because other than being a pausing point in the movie, Antaeus does not appear again.  I suppose you could argue that the encounter with Antaeus shows that Hercules is lazy, thus what happens later might be in Hercules' character; or not.

Soon Hercules encounters his old friend King Oedipus of Thebes, except the king is hiding out in a cave with one of his obnoxious sons trying to get the king's help in making his brother keep his promise to relinquish the throne.  Now the story gets complicated.  Hercules does convince the other brother to turn the throne over, but soon Thebes is threatened and Hercules volunteers to go on a diplomatic mission to make peace.  Unfortunately, Hercules drinks the waters of forgetfulness and ends up on an extended dalliance with Queen Oomphale of Lidia, forgetting completely that he was recently married.  On the other hand, Queen Oomphale is beautiful and maybe Hercules had an incentive to forget his young and beautiful wife, Iole.

Meanwhile, back in Thebes, things are starting to look grim for Iole.  The brother who is the king of Thebes (I kept losing track of which brother was which) threatens to kill Iole.  Next, the other brother has allied himself with another kingdom and the leader of that army has the hots for Iole.

In the meantime, Ulysses, clever lad that he is, rescues Hercules just about the time that Laertes, Ulysses father, and a group of other men land on the island en route to perform the diplomatic mission that Hercules was supposed to perform.  They were also hoping to find Hercules and Ulysses in the process.  After a rousing round of action, they manage to escape the island and head back to Thebes.

Back in Thebes things get really exciting.  The brother in Thebes threw a bunch of Iole's kinfolk off the city wall, which did them little good, and threatens to kill Iole the moment Hercules shows up.  Hercules and company sneak into Thebes about the time that the two brothers duke it out in a duel, ultimately killing each other.  Then the army outside Thebes attacks, beginning a very good battle scene that impressed me.

After having watched several other Hercules movies, I found this one much better in general.  The plot was more complex, the special effects were better, and the action was nearly epic at the end.  If you are looking for a good sword-and-sandals movie, as these types of movies were called, I recommend this particular movie as a good example of the genre.

Enjoy!",1340150400,2,3070,4.781783681214422

However, since this claimed to be widescreen and the 101 minute UK release, I thought I'd take a chance.  What this is is something that has been altered to give the viewer a headache inducing experience that will cause eyestrain with or without glasses (and don't bother ordering this if you don't have your own pair of those old cardboard glasses - glasses don't come with this bogus release).
Now to the length of this film.  It clocks in at just under 90 minutes, which makes it the shortest version released so far, including all those funky PD companies.  The U. S. theatrical release of this film ran 15 minutes longer.  The picture quality is absolutely horrible.  This is one of the best of the sword and sandal epics.

PLUSES
Mindless entertainment featuring the premier bodybuilder turned actor
Not a DVD with movies on both sides

FOIBLES
Poor construction of DVD entries/features
Movie ""special features"" resolve to opening screen (choice of either feature)
First feature, Hercules, goes black screen and does not resolve to menu after playing

The picture is good, not great, but good. It is in full screen as stated, and there are a few small flaws with picture quality. This should not be a factor in owning, this DVD, as these are two classics from the past. If you enjoyed watching them 50 years ago, you will be happy to see them again. If you are young and these were before your time, then just keep in mind when these two films were shot, and nothing has been digitally redone, like you can get in some of the older films.

929671,3,6304765363,"I've read a lot of reviews of these two films, HERCULES and HERCULES UNCHAINED, complaining about the picture quality.  The fact is, this is so far the best of what's out there.  I used to own VHS copies of both movies from VIDAmerica and Embassy Home Entertainment and the quality was no better.  Yes, there is a widescreen version with a much better picture circulating, but IT'S THE WRONG VERSION!  It's the European version with completely different voices used for dubbing, and in many cases different dialogue.  Half the fun for me is listening to those great theatrical voices speaking the dialogue, most particularly Hercules' booming baritone.  To get that, you must get the full screen copies with faded color and, in the case of the first movie, the animated opening that shows constellations forming until lightening strikes one and it becomes Hercules.  That's the version we saw as kids, and that's the one offered on VCI's DVD.

VCI offers both movies on one disc for a cheap price.  The DVD I received had no glitches of any kind, and the picture quality was no better or worse than I expected.  Sure it would be great to have a restored, widescreen presentation of Joseph E. Levine's American version, but so far it doesn't exist.  And with the European version out there, it may never exist.

Hercules Unchained is available on DVD from Italy widescreen for about $9. It is a nice transfer and gives you the option of English or Italian. (Sylva Koscina is speaking Italian in the film). When Iole is singing in the beginning of the film it is interesting to hear the same singer sing the Italian and English version. The fact that the film is PAL is zero problem when run on a computer. As for region coding, there are ways around that. ([...]the film and they will ship it to you in one week with an American VISA/Master). The edition is letterbox 1.85:1 ratio.

929677,4,6304765363,"""Hercules Unchained"" (1959) is an Italian/French/Spanish sword & sandal flick in the mold of Kirk Douglas' ""Ulysses"" (1954). I always loved ""Ulysses"" as a kid (and adult), which is far better than the boring 1997 TV remake ""The Odyssey"" despite its datedness. So if you have a fondness for ""Ulysses,"" ""Hercules Unchained"" is more of the same, with a very similar plot, i.e. the journeying hero forgets who he is while bewitched by a beautiful babe on some island.

Californian muscleman Steve Reeves plays the titular hero/god to perfection. Reeves is most known for his Hercules role but interestingly only played the part twice, in this film and the first one ""Hercules"" (1957). Anyway, one good side-effect of watching Reeves is that it will likely inspire guys to get in shape (the same effect as watching Stallone as Rambo).

In this film Herc is married to the beautiful Iole (Sylva Koscina), but he forgets his wife and homeland after drinking of the waters of forgetfulness and falls under the spell of Queen Omphale (Sylvia Lopez) of the isle Lidia. So Herc is caught between two beauties: Sylva and Sylvia.

""Hercules Unchained"" can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. It's a fun fantasy adventure with dated ""effects,"" but it also addresses quite a few mature themes.

One theme is the boneheaded predilection of men to sexual gratification and their intrinsic weakness to the spell of feminine beauty. Herc is married to cutie Iole (Sylva), but it wasn't too hard for him to fall under the power of Omphale (Sylvia). And he has the perfect excuse -- ""Aduh, I forgot"" (!).

Another theme is that feminine power can be used for good or evil, productivity or destruction. Sylva uses her feminine charms to catch herself a manly hunk (Reeves) for a husband and family, while Sylvia uses her womanly power to capture (literally) a never-ending succession of studs. Sylva wants a lifelong mate and family, whereas Sylvia is a black widow who kills her ""conquests"" after she gets bored with them and puts 'em in her trophy case, so to speak (you'll see what I mean).

Look around and you'll easily see both types of women in real life. One girl I knew in high school, for example, would catch herself a hunk boyfriend and ultimately start cheating on him as soon as she got bored; she would then let go of the boyfriend and officially hook up with the guy she was cheating with; once she got bored of him she'd start cheating with the next guy, ultimately dropping the boyfriend for him, ad nauseum. She was notorious, just like Omphale (Sylvia). She would even break up best friends with here expert feminine powers. The lunkheads could never come to the realization of what she was actually doing because they were too susceptible to her bewitching charms.

Interestingly, Sylva is beautiful in a cute way, whereas Sylvia is beautiful in a sharp, leggy and glamorous way. Both are well worth catching the film for if you're a red-blooded male.

Another theme is that of negative rivalry. The two siblings vie for kingship (or control) of Thebes. Proud rivaly begats enmity and violence, and ultimately mutually assured self-destruction. Both actors are outstanding, fittingly displaying a palpable royal pomp.

The sets and costuming are noteworthy. Mario Bava did the cinematography and special effects, as well as some directing, so the film has that colorful Bava look.

BOTTOM LINE: If you can overlook certain dated aspects (like the editing) ""Hercules Unchained"" is enjoyable on numerous levels, both juvenile and mature. It's the obvious precursor to modern films like ""Troy.""",1203811200,2,3590,4.909240924092409

But surprisingly, this is enchanting.  There are images that will not leave you easily.  If you are not a romantic and are easily put off, forget it.

The Westlake Entertainment version has a photo gallery in the extras section; the background music to this photo gallery consists of themes from the movie by the great Enzo Masetti, not easily found.  Simply amazing music, very cinematic and dreamy.

929680,5,6304765363,"After reading several of the reviews of this movie, I would like to add my two cents. First of all this is a good sword and sandal film from the late 1950's. If you want superior acting then I suggest Hamlet with Lawrence Olivier. This is a lightweight, fun film that picks up where the original HERCULES leaves off. Although most of his movies follow the same plot formula, this Steve Reeves film is still very entertaining. Alot of the characters in the first film are in this movie as well. The movie also has an above average musical score. In my opinion his three best films are HERCULES, HERCULES UNCHAINED, and THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD.I also have several  videos of him appearing in a number of television shows with his real speaking voice. Although his voice was not baritone, it is hardly ""tinny"".He turned down the role that eventually went to Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Reeves did not like the direction in which 1960's films were headed, so he decided to retire from acting.",1166745600,9,1010,4.674157303370786

The real problem is that the digital transfer used Westlake Entertainment Group is very poor quality. The resultant film imagery is like a very old VHS tape.

I would not recommend you buy from this distributor. This is symptomatic of a wider problem in which classic films that were made before the advent of the digital age are being treated disgracefully by producing bad low budget DVDs transfers.

929800,2,6304765363,"If you like poorly made movies from the 50s and 60s then the Hercules movies are good ones. This is the second movie that featured Steve Reeves as the title character and he was clearly the best of the lot. The way he looked and moved and spoke, you could really believe he was Hercules.

In this movie Herc and his wife and young Ulysses are headed to his home city of Thebes when they get sidetracked. Herc drinks from an enchanted pool of water and forgets who he is. He ends up with Queen Omphale, convinced he is married to her. Ulysses pretends to be Herc's deaf mute servant and tries to restore the Big Man's memory. There are other political elements to the plot but not much of it makes sense. Herc flexes his muscles, Omphale flexes her cleavage and there is a big free-for-all fight scene at the end. Hercules ends up back with his wife Iole and everyone lives happily ever after. The acting is cheesy, the direction erratic and the script bizarre.",1157500800,2,960,4.423728813559322
929801,4,6304765363,"This movie opens with a confusing scene where a woman brings a man into her domicile, and shortly thereafter the young man who was there meets his end.  Okay, what the heck was that all about?  Next we see Hercules (Steve Reeves), Ulysses (Gabriele Antonini), and Iole (Sylva Koscina) arriving on land as they journey home to Thebes.  Shortly thereafter the trio encounters Antaeus (Primo Carnera), a half-god giant who appears to enjoy either killing people or snacking on them.  Antaeus is another moment of confusion because other than being a pausing point in the movie, Antaeus does not appear again.  I suppose you could argue that the encounter with Antaeus shows that Hercules is lazy, thus what happens later might be in Hercules' character; or not.

Soon Hercules encounters his old friend King Oedipus of Thebes, except the king is hiding out in a cave with one of his obnoxious sons trying to get the king's help in making his brother keep his promise to relinquish the throne.  Now the story gets complicated.  Hercules does convince the other brother to turn the throne over, but soon Thebes is threatened and Hercules volunteers to go on a diplomatic mission to make peace.  Unfortunately, Hercules drinks the waters of forgetfulness and ends up on an extended dalliance with Queen Oomphale of Lidia, forgetting completely that he was recently married.

Meanwhile, back in Thebes, things are starting to look grim for Iole.  The brother who is the king of Thebes (I kept losing track of which brother was which) threatens to kill Iole.  Next, the other brother has allied himself with another kingdom and the leader of that army has the hots for Iole.

In the meantime, Ulysses, clever lad that he is, rescues Hercules just about the time that Laertes, Ulysses father, and a group of other men land on the island en route to perform the diplomatic mission that Hercules was supposed to perform.  They were also hoping to find Hercules and Ulysses in the process.  After a rousing round of action, they manage to escape the island and head back to Thebes.

Back in Thebes things get really exciting.  The brother in Thebes threw a bunch of Iole's kinfolk off the city wall, which did them little good, and threatens to kill Iole the moment Hercules shows up.  Hercules and company sneak into Thebes about the time that the two brothers duke it out in a duel, ultimately killing each other.  Then the army outside Thebes attacks, beginning a very good battle scene that impressed me.

After having watched several other Hercules movies, I found this one much better in general.  The plot was more complex, the special effects were better, and the action was nearly epic at the end.  If you are looking for a good sword-and-sandals movie, as these types of movies were called, I recommend this particular movie as a good example of the genre.",1138492800,6,2854,4.793456032719837
929802,3,6304765363,"This 1959 Italian classic is a sequel to Hercules, also with Steve Reeves, the first and in some ways best muscleman-turned-actor, and these Hercules films opened the door for endless ""sword and sandal"" epics to follow. This sequel is slower and inferior to the first Reeves film as Hercules spends much of the film lounging around under the influence of the ""waters of forgetfulness."" Beautiful dancing girls abound as Hercules spends his days eating grapes and snuggling with the beautiful but way overly made-up Queen Omphale (Sylvia Lopez). There is some action at the beginning and again at the end of the film, but the middle is extremely slow and not too taughtly directed. Except for the beautiful dancing and serving girls prancing around in between the lounging scenes, nearly nothing happens at all for quite some time. Nevertheless, the film has its fun moments.

This film is also available in The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Volume 7 4-disc set and it is terrific and funny. The crew of the Satellite of Love (SOL) makes it a special treat. The host segment where the robots (puppets Tom Servo and Crow) try and get Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgson) to explain what Hercules and the ""nice lady"" do all day as if they were kids asking a parent about a sexual situation is drop-dead hilarious, yet as always it is handled so that kids can watch the show, enjoy it, and yet have no idea what they've missed in the way of adult-level jokes. Even the slower parts of the film are fun when the writers and performers of MST3K get done with them.

Whether you watch this film in its original form or the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version, it is classic family fun and still entertaining.",1122854400,5,1693,4.716216216216216
929803,4,6304765363,"Hercules Unchained (Ercole e la Regina di Lidia, aka Hercules and the Queen of Lydia aka Hercules and the Queen of Sheba) was Steve Reeves' second (and last) Hercules film, a direct follow-up to the well-received original Hercules.  A lot more money went into the production of this film, but it never succeeds in becoming anything more than merely good.  Perhaps part of the problem is the fact that the storyline diverges from the original mythology of Hercules and stumbles here and there along its way.  There's nothing wrong with Herc and his fellow good guys, but the villains here are just a little bit too silly to really take seriously.  The women in this film, on the other hand, are gorgeous, and that's always a plus.

Herc, Laertes, and the guys have just returned home, and Hercules, with wife Iole (Sylva Koscina) and young Ulysses (Gabriele Antonini) in tow, can't wait to return to his beloved Thebes.  Before he even gets there, the half-god Antaeus attacks him just for passing through his land.  It soon becomes clear that the portrait Herc has been painting of the city is way off, as bad times have fallen on Thebes.  Oedipus has been forced into exile, while his two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, stand on the verge of a civil war to determine the rightful king.  Herc undertakes a peace mission, but during his journey he makes the mistake of drinking from the Waters of Forgetfulness.  Ulysses clams up and plays the role of a deaf-mute as he and Herc are transported to the island of Lydia, where Queen Omphale (Sylvia Lopez) waits to add Hercules to her collection of stuffed and mounted former lovers.

The amnesiac Hercules truly forgets everything, including his marriage vows to fair Iole, as he embraces the life of a king with the dangerously becoming Omphale at his side, serving girls trotting and giggling all over the place, and not a single care in the world.  Ulysses, now a slave, keeps trying to awaken Hercules' memory as he awaits the aid of his father Laertes and his allies.  All the while, as Herc is eating grapes and smooching with the queen, disaster draws nigh for the city of Thebes, and his wife Iole stands in mortal danger.

Pietro Francisci directs this 1959 Italian release, while the great Mario Bava oversees photography and special effects.  If you ask me, the best special effect is Sylva Koscina, but a number of fights and even a chariot-drawn duel ensue as the movie winds toward its conclusion.  For whatever reason, though, it's just hard to get overly excited about any segment of this film - but at least it's not as silly as some of the other Hercules movies.",1116720000,7,2627,4.703056768558952

Surely! Steve Reeves deserved better.
It looked like the company put the 2 movies on DVD in the quickest and cheapest way without any consideration for the actor.
It made the movies look......Cheapily Done like a B or C rated movie.
Here are items that need improvement.
COLOUR - the movie needs to be digitally enhanced to bring out a more sharper, krispier colour. When I watched the movies you can see tiny, white specks and lines dancing around which showed the DVD was made from films that were worn and fading. Also some scenes were blurred. Not very clear.
AUDIO - The soundtrack could be remastered to make it smoother.
I have other movies like JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH starring James Mason, Pat Boone; JASON and THE ARGONAUTS, MYSTERIOUS ISLAND are just a few that were made back in the sixties. All these and others that I have, have been digitally enhanced in widescreen format with sharper, clearer picture colour and improved soundtrack.
