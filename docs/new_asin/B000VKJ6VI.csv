8219212,5,B000VKJ6VI,"I am a huge fan of this series, and this volume is no exception. The artwork is as superb as ever, and the voice acting is excellent as well.
This continues the story of Keichi Morisato and the goddess Belldandy. It is a great romantic comedy that I reccommend to everyone who is looking for a good anime.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ah-My-Goddess-Season-2-Flights-of-Fancy-Vol-4-I-m-a-Believer/dp/B000VKJ6VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ah!

8219213,5,B000VKJ6VI,"Complications abound in this series of episodes as Skuld learns the benefits of doing things the hard way, while Marller gives us another example of the dangers of a little bit of knowledge. Along the way, both Skuld and Urd face some tough choices, along with interesting opportunities, and Skuld even gets her angel (sort of).
This story line is my personal favorite, and this entry is certainly no exception. This whole saga may seem a bit much to jump into at this point, but it's not overly complex. If you can accept the premise of who these characters are, even a novice can find a wonderful story here, not to mention a whole lot of fun. I give this series my highest recommendation.",1209513600,,691,4.580645161290323
8219214,5,B000VKJ6VI,This is another good addition to the Ah! my goddess anime. I highly recommend this anime to anyone I meet.,1199750400,,106,4.35
8219215,5,B000VKJ6VI,"If you like the Ah my Goddess Series then you obviously have started season two, this is the 4th installment.  It is just as wonderfull as the rest so a definate must for all Goddess' fans.",1196467200,,189,4.25
8219216,5,B000VKJ6VI,"In this, the fourth installment of the second season of Ah! My Goddess!, the ""second banana"" goddesses Skuld and Urd each have two stories.
  In the first episode on the disc, Skuld, the ""bratty little kid"" goddess, struggles to learn to ride a bike in the ""conventional"" manner (i.e., without her usual mechanical aids). As with so much of Ah! My Goddess!, this is a gentle story without a lot of magical ""gimmicks"" and very family-friendly; I think kids could certainly benefit from the message that you have to keep trying even if you fall. The second episode on the disc follows on to this one, with Skuld's new ""boyfried"" Sentaro (who helped her learn to ride a bike) entering a race, and Skuld dealing with a somewhat-accidentally acquired mini-angel.
The second two episodes are a two-parter in which Marller (the rather inept demon who constantly plagues the goddesses) tricks Urd into giving up some hair so Marller can, with a ""heretical pot,"" transfer the demon side of Urd into a clone created from that hair sample. For Urd fans (count me as one) these two episodes are a delight, and there are some truly great gags involving how ""creepy"" Urd seems with only her good side, as well as one of my favorites, when Marller is explaining to Urd about how she got the pot from a ""hellish mail-order catalog"" (I think I've actually GOTTEN some of those...)",1194998400,2,1363,4.698744769874477
