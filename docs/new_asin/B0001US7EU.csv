8173545,4,B0001US7EU,"3 VHS TRANSFER onto a DVD.The first gig is amazing,very after punk sounding,Flood Of lies being presented at the moment. Sound is incredibly ok for a punk 1983 film,picture is not top notch but like on a standard VHS,OK though. 2nd gig sound is barely tolerable but raw and full of energy and funny situations. 3rd gig with New Barbarians,sound same as 2nd only I don't like em,so.....

NICE IF YOU'RE A SUBS FAN,plus I got it dirt cheap too !!!!!!",1139961600,,448,4.530864197530864
