8428099,4,B004FN8PFK,"Jack Satin is, as far as I can tell, not a very good lounge singer.  He's also got a ""hot mess"" of a life as he owes ""vig"" to some thumb-busters and his shallow charm isn't getting him any gigs in Vegas.  So, he lights out of Vegas for Atlantic City, but, consistent with his life, his vehicle breaks down.

In the middle of the desert.

This is where the movie really starts because he washes up in a tiny Nevada desert community filled with oddballs and refugees, including a waitress with a heart of gold, her over-muscled ex-boyfriend, and a former horn blower for Duke Ellington. For not particular reason, because he is a bit of a shallow jerk without much obvious talent, he's taken in by the former and latter and tormented by the guy in the middle.

All in all, it is fun ""fish out of water"" movie that put me in mind of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Northern-Exposure-Season-1/dp/B006WK4Y6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Northern Exposure: Season 1</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Hollywood/dp/B000GT92LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Hollywood</a>.

The cast is first rate.  I enjoyed Hamilton Von Watt's (Jack Satin) performance in ""Sunken City"" and he brings a definite smarmy, callow charm to his characters.  The waitress is Melissa Joan Hart, so the warmth factor for her is off the charts, and Robert Guillarme is the former bluesman.

It's a feel-good movie. It's not great, but it is worth watching for the nice vibe it leaves you with.",1417305600,,1557,5.5358649789029535
8428100,3,B004FN8PFK,"This story is one of ambition, vanity, and the fickle ways of ""stardom.""  The actors were all first rate and perhaps the absence of gratiutous drama was on the plus side.  It has an endearing old character that was based on a real person, and I found that interesting enough to go to Wikipedia after watching the movie.  I like my stories to move along quickly and this one went a little slower than I would have liked; however, that make it much more real.  It's a good story of redemption.  ""Satin"" was recommended to me because of the setting.  I visited Death Valley last year for the first time, so the dusty little town and the characters who landed there were somewhat familiar.  This is a good lazy Saturday night movie.",1355875200,,728,4.46969696969697
8428101,5,B004FN8PFK,"Great movie Great sound track... jack kinda left me hangin, but overall watched it with critical eye, (backround stuff,filming flubs)
didnt see any... Congrats to Hamilton V. and crew for getting it out into distribution",1314403200,,220,5.314285714285714
8428102,4,B004FN8PFK,"Satin is a fun ride. A down on his luck Vegas lounge singer, Jack Satin, his first big break was shining Wayne Newton's shoes, breaks down in a small town and learns about music and love...
I watch a lot of indie movies and it's one of the best I've seen in a while - great off beat characters, beautiful music, strikes a careful balance between comedy and drama that makes it very entertaining and by the end poetic and soulful. I already know it's one of those movies I'm going to watch again and again to be inspired and find new laughs.",1311638400,,540,4.252427184466019
8428103,5,B004FN8PFK,"I love old Vegas, road trips to the desert and I play in a band, so Satin had me going right away. The drummer in my band didn't want to over hype it so he played it cool in telling me about it. Boy was I surprised. This indie film is a good time and packs a lot in. The cast is great, lots of of dry off beat humor and at times pulls at the heart strings. There's this music contraption in it called the ""Circle"" I think, that I've never seen before, crazy new age music training device - a must see. Jack Satin reminds me of a lot of cocky guys I knew coming up, this lost dude is funny. When I saw Benson, I said, ""Where has that guy been?"" Another surprise is the guy from Southland, the tough cop, always plays the tough cop, well in Satin he play a very different role, don't want to spoil it but he got me laughing. Melissa Joan Hart who is the love interest has really grown up here. She was cute as The Teenage Witch but now she's a woman I could go for. Satin was fun and delivered more than I expected.",1311638400,,1013,3.9223300970873787

Hamilton Von Watts is Great.
Great story and it is wonderful to see all the old actors
in this.",1301875200,,113,4.428571428571429
8428105,5,B004FN8PFK,"This is definitely one of the better indie flicks I've seen in awhile. It's a nice blend of comedy and more emotional heart than you'd guess from the trailer. The plot synopsis above sums the story up well. Hamilton von Watts turns in a great performance as the title character. Definitely my favorite part. It would have been easy to just ham the role up and overplay the lounge singer bit, but von Watts really hooked me. I found him to be more tragic and emotionally grounded than I would have expected. Was pleasantly surprised. Supporting cast is also fantastic. I love seeing Melissa Joan Hart and Robert Guillaume (Sports Night 4 life) in some roles. Overall it's a great watch. Highly recommended if you like intimate, funny and surprisingly heartfelt indie films. Rent this one.",1298937600,,787,4.794117647058823
8428106,4,B004FN8PFK,"I'm a huge Melissa Joan Hart fan.  In this movie she plays Lauren Wells, a small town bartender and waitress.  Her character is sweet, vulnerable and strong.  She plays a girl feeling a little stuck and looking for more out of life.  When Jack Satin, a Vegas lounge singer arrives, though he's full of himself, he sparks her interest.  She's not into him right away,  but as they spend time together she sees underneath his showy act there is a man she just might love.  Though sweet and funny, this role is also dramatic and a welcomed departure for Melissa.  I hope she takes on more roles like this.  The movie left me with that warm and fuzzy feelling.  Only thing I wish is that there was more of her, but the title is Satin and it is the lounge singer's story, so maybe if we are lucky there will be a Satin 2 and it will kick off with Jack Satin and Melissa right away.  Oh, and she looks beautiful in this.",1298851200,,914,4.22543352601156
