6681370,3,B00NW6KRZM,I enjoyed watching this movie,1416268800,,29,5.0
6681371,5,B00NW6KRZM,"It's a perfect Rob Reiner film - heartfelt, funny, engaging, good character development, life lessons and a tear jerking feel good ending. Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton were a delightful duo and disappeared into the characters as good actors should. Such a nice departure from the violence and dreck. Enjoy;)",1415491200,4,311,5.24
6681372,4,B00NW6KRZM,"The happy tears will flow, or at least choke you up during this movie.
I didn't like Michael Douglas's character one bit. At first, anyway. That changed though. Michael Douglas played this guy well though.
He actually became my favorite character, next to the little girl who stole the show. Yeah, surprised me too.
This is such a romantic, yet funny movie. Perfect for date night. Family and love are the two themes, though told in a humorous way.
I recommend this heartwarming movie.",1414281600,11,485,4.785714285714286
6681373,3,B00NW6KRZM,"""Do people really let you get away with you being you?"" Oren Little (Douglas) is a realtor who's life revolves around himself. He is trying to sell his house so he can move far away from everyone and everything. While he is trying to sell he is living in an apartment complex that he owns with tenants who can't stand him and he feels the same. Before his son heads to jail for a few months he asks Oren for one little favor. He wants him to take care of the grand-daughter he never knew about. His neighbor Leah (Keaton) begins to help him and Oren's feelings about the world start to change. There isn't really a whole lot to say about this movie. It was good and I laughed quite a bit and stayed interested the entire time. The only real problem is that it's so generic that it is hard to really recommend too highly. Douglas and Keaton are a great team and Rob Reiner is a great director but to me this whole movie felt phoned in. This is very predictable but with a romantic comedy that is not uncommon. There really is nothing bad to say about this but nothing to amazing to say about it either. Overall, a good but very generic comedy. I liked Something's Gotta Give much better. I give this a B-.",1413158400,52,1204,4.239130434782608
6681374,4,B00NW6KRZM,"Oren Little (Michael Douglas) is a successful Connecticut real estate agent wanting to sell his $5.8 million dollar home for $8.6 million. Being an old white guy he makes politically incorrect statements without knowing he is offensive. He lives in a converted apartment building that he also owns. His wife has passed on years ago, but he has trouble moving on creating a rough exterior. Like most people in Connecticut, he dreams of living in Vermont.

Leah (Diane Keaton) is his neighbor, lounge singer. She too has issues in dealing with a lost spouse. (Guess where this goes.) Out of the blue, Oren's long lost , former drug user son Luke (Scott Shepherd) shows up. He is going to spend a few months in prison and needs Oren to look after his 10 year old well adjusted daughter Sarah (Sterling Jerins) named after grandma, Oren's wife. Oren refuses but gets stuck with her anyway as she becomes a project for both Oren and Leah.

The film is formula. The on screen chemistry is hit or miss and doesn't seemed to be operating on all cylinders. There weren't any heavy Puffs' moments.

The take away for guys is that after sex, women require 10 minutes of cuddling...try not to get caught looking at the clock.

Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Implied sex. Sex/drug references. Soft 4 stars.",1412380800,26,1306,4.714912280701754
6681375,4,B00NW6KRZM,"Michael Douglas has made a late-life career out of playing selfish, racist, sexist scalawags. This predictable PG-13 outing is no different. His self-absorbed character is stuck with a grandchild he never knew about (he hadn't spoken to his drug-addicted son in quite some time) while that son goes to jail. Our hero lives in a four-plex and alienates all of his other neighbors; this doesn't bother him a bit. We can hardly wait for this nasty piece of work to get his well-deserved comeuppance!

Directed by Rob Reiner (""When Harry Met Sally..."" and ""The Bucket List"") from a script by Mark Andrus (the excellent ""Life as a House"") this is a guaranteed over-50s crowd pleaser. The sound track, which begins with Judy Collins singing ""Both Sides Now"" and continues on to Diane Keaton singing ""The Shadow of Your Smile,"" is both warm and satisfying.

We watch:
  * Michael Douglas (""Last Vegas"") Oren is the exasperated (and exasperating!) grandpa who does NOT want a child in his life. He is trying to sell his luxurious house and refuses to take a penny under what he thinks it's worth, regardless of the comps in the neighborhood.
  * Diane Keaton (""The Big Wedding"") Leah is the neighbor on whom he dumps the little girl; he exploits her good nature without an ounce of remorse. He hears her sing at a neighborhood spot and says he likes everything but her clothes, her patter and her selections...but is willing to represent her.
  * Sterling Jerins (""World War Z"") Sarah is a good little kid, scared, but willing to be flexible. She is deeply grateful for Leah's presence while Dad is ""away."" In fact, she starts to call her ""Grandma.""
  * Frankie Valli (""The Sopranos"") (Yes THAT Frankie Valli!) is the guy who auditions Leah after Oren nominates himself as her agent.
  * Frances Sternhagen (""The Closer"") Claire is his chain-smoking long-time office manager (40+ years) who sees everything with crystal clarity and speaks just as plainly!
  * Rob Reiner (""The Wolf of Wall Street"") Artie is Leah's friend, erstwhile suitor and piano accompanist who wears the worst toupee ever on screen. (Oren is NOT gentle about it!)

And so....When a movie is designed for a target audience, it should be no surprise that the target found it entertaining. As we left the theater, the general consensus was that we liked it, but one woman took it a step further. ""I'll own this one,"" she declared. ""My boyfriend is gonna watch it!""

Expect a bit of profanity, an implied sexual situation, no blowie uppie stuff or vehicular mayhem and the only gunshot is when our ""hero"" shoots a stray Rottweiler with a paint-ball.",1411948800,59,2609,4.803131991051454

6681407,5,B00NW6KRZM,I would guess whether or not you like this movie depends on your age and if you prefer sex and violence.  At the age of 68 I thought this was one of the best films for adults.  Sometimes I think you have to think beyond the superficial story line to understand what it's really about and this was one of those movies.  It was also nice not to have useless sex scenes and gory violence pop up every 2 minutes or to have to listen to vulgarity non-stop.,1503619200,9,451,4.1022727272727275

How did the filmmakers know when they started making this doc that all this crazy real-life stuff was going to happen? Amazing. My favorite part is when Michael's Beverly Hills neighbor Leah comes to the rescue -- not only bailing out the movie star, but also capturing his heart.

6681476,4,B00NW6KRZM,"A feel good romantic comedy. Michael Douglas does a good job of portraying a man who has shut down emotionally after the death of his wife. Diane Keaton is equally adept at portraying a woman who can't control the emotions she feels after the death of her husband. How the two characters balance one another is entwined in a story with good dialogue, some witty lines ,good supporting actors and great music. It's worth the watch.",1461024000,,430,4.671052631578948

6681499,3,B00NW6KRZM,"A terrific cast is not enough to compensate for a very weak script and inept direction.  The writer seemed to have some good ideas, but no sense of transition -- the few really good scenes were cobbled together with a host of bad ones, and plot was all over the place.  Pacing was off -- the reveal of the condos' owner, for example, was introduced much too early, like an inexperience comic rushing the punchline.  In several scenes, Keaton appeared to be reading her lines.  Boring for the most part, punctuated with all-too-brief hints at what this film could have, and should have, been.",1453507200,,591,4.653846153846154

A year or two later -- there it was-- funny sound bites of it came up in conversation,  but nobody could remember it's title.  In particular,  Michael Douglas' grumpy self.  Retrieving the title from Google,  went ahead and re-viewed it.  Wonderful film.  Having taken it in several times,  each new look reveals that the one liners,  characters, and life lessons contained therein are stupendous.  The tidings of great joy mixed into the harrowing drama and humor makes for a satisfying popcorn flick.  Frankie Valli makes an appearance, too.",1451088000,2,659,4.926605504587156

6681521,2,B00NW6KRZM,"""And So It Goes"" simply has to be a good movie.  With a lineup of talent like Rob Reiner, Diane Keaton and Michael Douglas, it could not help to be a winner.  Wrong!  I believe the actors just never got into their parts and Rob Reiner decided it just wasn't worth the effort.  What was supposed to be a comedy was never humorous and the plot line that was supposed to tug on one's heartstrings did not tug very hard.  The characters were never very believable and the plot was similarly lacking in credibility.  And Diane Keaton's talents do not extend to singing so her club singer persona also failed the beleiveability test.  All in all, pretty much a waste of my time and of the cast, who I am certain could have found a better vehicle for their talents.",1446336000,,758,4.371428571428571

6681641,3,B00NW6KRZM,"It's...cute. Ish. That's the best I can say. I am a huge fan of Diane Keaton, and her turn as Erica Barry in Something's Gotta Give literally changed my life, crazy though it may sound. I keep hoping and praying that Nancy Meyers writes a follow-on for Harry and Erica, but until then I've been making my way through every Keaton film because that's what is so fantastic about her: she is who she is.

I had really high hopes for And So It Goes. I couldn't stand getting to the end and feeling like the story was only half told. I mean, yes, we got some amazing, pure-Keaton moments, but since when does the queen of vulnerability play the romantic lead in a movie and never say ""I love you,"" or some iteration thereof?! It was as if Rob Reiner cut her off after the first act.

The story was contrived but could really have gone somewhere. In Something's Gotta Give, it's a clear plot twist that Harry Sanborn's heart attack, coupled with falling in love at age 63...for the first time in his life...with Erica Barry, no less...is the catalyst that spurs him to turn his life around. In And So It Goes, we see Leah begin to let her guard down for Oren, and Oren showing signs of possessing a conscience but there is missing the passion and depth of emotion typical of a Keaton performance, and Douglas-as-Oren is but a shadow of shmuck-who-deserves-to-die Harry Sanborn. I don't believe there is fault on the parts of Ms Keaton or Mr. Douglas. It seems the critical flaw lies in Reiner's handicapping the dynamic potential of his leads.

It's cute (there's that word again), but at best it leaves you shaking your head and thinking, 'where's the rest of the story?"" ""Cute"" sells Diane Keaton so very far short. It's high time she gets a role that recognizes her unique ability to be more beautiful, elegant, subtle, nuanced, raw-yet-polished than any actress alive today.",1436140800,,1872,4.582089552238806

There have been worse scripts that make less sense as characters veer from curmudgeon to softie to jerk to good guy to cynical to sappy. There have been equally meaningless movie titles that render them hard to remember. But this was right up there. (And no, it's not because I'm ""too young to appreciate"" it, as I'm 58 and love romantic comedies, and love movies that realistically address issues I care about at my age.) I watched this for free on Netflix streaming, so it isn't that I minded paying $10 for a movie ticket. But it didn't even make it as free Friday night entertainment.

6681703,5,B00NW6KRZM,"I suppose that when you have a stable of older actors playing romantic roles in rom-coms it's only inevitable that the actors are going to get older, and that eventually they're going to seem TOO old for anything that isn't on the order of ""Whales Of August"" or ""On Golden Pond"".  To that end, this rom com feels like a made for TV movie developed by AARP and sponsored by Geritol and some motorized stair climber company.

In many ways it also feels like a low budget version of ""Something's Gotta Give""---with the convertible driving through Long Island enclaves, and Diane Keaton in bed crying after making love for the first time since the end of the Cold War---or was it the Korean War?  Except that Michael Douglas is not Jack Nicholson, even if the latter was over 70 when he played the part.

Oren Little (Douglas) is a bitter widower who can't get over the loss of his wife, who, nevertheless, seems far more cynical and cold to have only gotten that way since she died.  As a realtor, he's trying to sell the family home.  His son turns up---a former addict but one who apparently had a fine white collar job on Wall Street until the SEC screwed him.  Now he's going to jail for 9 months and he dumps his daughter on his dad (but only after Dad very rudely refused to help).

As Little struggles to sell his house, he lives in a two-story lakeshore quadplex that he shares with Leah (Keaton), a lounge singer who can't sing a song without bursting into tears thinking of her late husband;  another woman who is raising twin sons, and a black couple.

A word about the African Americans.  As we all know, rom coms are notoriously racist, almost exclusively white, with no important roles for anyone non-white, unless they are stereotyped.  In this instance though, Reggie (Albert Jones) is given  a pointed but polite dialog with Little over parking, and then Little delivers his wife's (Almirah Vann)  baby (after removing her panties, at her insistance) so you know this film is not really racist, aside from the fact that the couple have no other role in the film.  Hollywood Addresses Racism In Film.  Sort of.

The problem is that Oren Little is so bitter and so cynical, and honestly, so OLD.  Everyone is so old.  Diane Keaton repirses her role as a chanteuse, but she sits most of the time, as if she's too tired to stand to sing.  The camera pans over the audience and no one is under 65.  It's as if the film wants to be ""Something's Gotta Give"" but it can't manage more than ""Something's Gotta Break"".  Everything felt forced, tired, broken.

Not a great ninety minutes.",1428969600,,2590,4.546436285097192

6681763,3,B00NW6KRZM,"There weren't really any surprises in this movie, but it was fun all the same.  It had quite a few good laughs, mostly revolving around Oren, the grouchy old man who offends all around him and doesnt seem to care, and his co-worker in the real estate office who tells it like it is.  Basically, Oren had lost his beloved wife and now is in the process of selling their home, but doesnt want to reduce the price by even one penny from the 8 plus million dollar price tag.  Its clear that it means more to him than just a home as it represents his once dream life with his wife.  In the meantime, he is hanging out in a small complex by the lake, offending everyone there as well, where he bumps into Leah, a woman who also has lost her husband.  You can see where this about to gobut it ends up a funny and touching romp all the same.

What sparks the movie is Orens son having to go to jail and dropping Orens granddaughter into his lap to take care of in the meantime.  Leah ends up in the role of grandma to Sarah, even as Oren reluctantly (grouching the whole way) is drawn into caring both about Sarah and Leah.  He even ends up with a pet dog in the process, go figure!

6681869,2,B00NW6KRZM,"Just not worthy of these two stars - literally and figuratively speaking!  I wanted to like this film. When my husband asked me why I picked a film starring Diane Keaton, I said that I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt.  In other films, all I recall are the big, wide belts that she wears (she wore one in this film as well).  I enjoyed ""Something's Gotta Give"", however.  I am really not familiar with much of Michael Douglas'  recent work.  In any case, I was disappointed with this film. The young girl playing the granddaughter was charming and she has a lot of potential.  Too bad that there was relatively little of her in this film.  The film seemed contrived and ""phoned in"" as one other reviewer commented.  Michael Douglas goes from cantankerous to charming.  Diane Keaton plays a part-time lounge singer who sort of languidly sings and emotes between songs at a local place to a singer with a gig for $1,500 per week.  That was the most far-fetched aspect of the film. As a singer, she is above average at best.  How she lands such a sweet deal is beyond me.  Sorry for the disjointed review. I just wanted to point out a few things that just didn't ring true for me. Maybe you will feel otherwise.",1420416000,,1219,4.4125560538116595

Michael Douglas, plays a grumpy real estate agent, looking for his last good sale before he retires to Vermont. He is trying to sell his own house for much more than it is worth. He lives in a rental unit of four apartments that he owns, while waiting for this sale. His neighbors and tenants don't like him, I didn't like him, either.  Diane Keaton, is one of the tenants, looking for a career in singing. To tell the truth her voice is awful, and she breaks down crying over her dead husband at every gig. One day, Douglas's ex-addict son drops by, saying he is off to prison and needs Douglas to look after his ten year old daughter.  Douglas says no, but the son and granddaughter show up anyway. Keaton is asked to look after her while Douglas works. You know what occurs next.

There are no laughs, too much 'poor me', and the entire film is not good. I asked Amazon for my money back after the twenty minute viewing.

Douglas is in a familiar type of role that he seems to have made a late career at playing. Although I would call this movie great, it was ok and had its moments and watchable all the way through. There were some scenes that were good but I felt too short and abandoned (such as the introduction to mom scene) and at times the movie felt a bit flat and emotionless.  Keeton though was really good in her role and really made the movie in my opinion.

The movie also is very formulaic and predictable and really offers nothing new. Not to say the movie is bad,  but it is short of great.

With that being said though, this movie is very watchable and I found entertaining with a decent story.

6682042,1,B00NW6KRZM,When I first heard there was a movie with this title I thought someone was making a Kurt Vonnegut biopic. Then I realized it had nothing to do with him. I figured that any writer who would use a phrase so closely associated with Vonnegut could at least put together a decent story but this just wasn't. It starts out uncomfortable and ends up all warm and fuzzy. The abrupt transition without explanation destroys what could be an entertaining film. I know sometimes reality is suspended for the sake of entertainment but the way that Michael Douglas behaves at a professional level isn't entertaining. It doesn't add anything to the story unless they added in a side plot about him being sanctioned by his local real estate association for blatant Fair Housing violations.,1418601600,5,773,4.819548872180451

6682084,5,B00NW6KRZM,"Oren (Michael Douglas) is a cranky insensitive realtor who rubs everyone the wrong way.  Leah (Diane Keaton) is a kind and sensitive cabaret singer who breaks down in tears whenever she sings a melancholic  song.  One wouldn't think that there would be much in common with these two except for their ages, somewhere around sixty-five, a shared apartment complex in Connecticut, and that they both lost a spouse.  The thread that brings these two together is Oren's granddaughter Sarah (Sterling Jerins) dropped on the doorstep by his estranged recovering heroin addict son who has to serve a nine month prison term for securities crimes.  Initially Oren is resistant to Sarah leaving the rearing to Leah.  As time goes on Oren is smitten by Sarah's charm which in turn brings him closer to Leah.  Though far from a curmudgeon Leah adopts a thicker exterior at Oren's behest.  This film posits the idea that it's never too late to fall and grow into love and that true change from within is not impossible.  To some this may sound like clich but in the expert hands of Douglas and Keaton you will believe. Both are in top form here and have a definite kinetic chemistry.  It also helps that Jerins is an impressive young talent bereft of cutesy kid affectations.  The ageless Frances Sternhagen (Cliff's mom on ""Cheers"") steals scenes as Douglas' chain smoking wisecracking colleague at the real estate office.  One shouldn't forget that Rob Reiner, who has a funny unbilled bit as Keaton's piano accompanist, is an accomplished director who has a feel for this type material as he demonstrated in ""The Bucket List"" among his many accomplishments.  This film flew under the radar among the summer blockbusters but is perfect for home viewing.

Diann Keaton is surprisingly good at singing, and of course, it goes with out saying, Micheal Douglas is always good, and worth watching.  It's a fun, feel good movie, rent or buy, pop some popcorn and have a nice evening.",1417564800,2,393,4.557142857142857

6682110,2,B00NW6KRZM,"Sooooo disappointed I bought this.  I am a huge Diane Keaton fan and like most of Douglas' films.  There were moments when Keaton comes through with her quirky comedy timing, but for the most part a really, really odd story line and it took an hour for me to decide if Douglas was just a creepy old guy.  No symmetry between Keaton and Douglas at all and totally unbelievable they would fall for each other.  First Keaton film in years that didn't at least make me smile at times.  Odd story, odd casting, I'd pass if I were you as far as buying it.",1417392000,,549,4.240384615384615
