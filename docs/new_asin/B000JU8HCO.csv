8153101,4,B000JU8HCO,"And that's exactly how THE MYSTERIOUS RIDER (1942) begins. Ride, ride, ride as Buster ( Billy the Kid ) and Fuzzy ( err, Fuzzy ) are trying to outride a posse hellbent on capturing our two heroes, all to the tinny bombastic strains of PRC's stock music library. After fooling the posse with the old empty hat on a rock trick, our pals hide out in a ghost town only to be shot at by badguy Jack Ingram. It seems that Jack's boss , chief badguy John Merton is looking for a lost/hidden gold claim but needs the map he had murdered Old Man Kinkaid for. The map was hidden in Kinkaid's fiddle only to be discovered by Fuzzy after he accidently smashes the instrument. Kinkaid's son and daughter arrive and after Buster saves them and Fuzzy several times the badguys are defeated and our two heroes ride, ride...
FUZZY SETTLES DOWN (1944) has Buster ( Billy Carson this time ) and Fuzzy ( err, Fuzzy ) capturing a couple bank robbers and getting a reward which Fuzzy spends at an auction on a newspaper business. It seems that Edith Martin's ( Patti McCarty ) father, newspaper editor John Martin ( John Elliott ) has been murdered by outlaws who don't like what he prints. Now Fuzzy, who just wants to settle down, is the next target. Charlie King, most everybody's favorite badguy, plays the Boss/Brains heavy and John Merton this time 'round is Pete the henchman. Buster again saves Edith and Fuzzy several times as he outwits the outlaws and saves the newspaper and telegraph line the paper was supporting. At the end Fuzzy decides he'd rather not settle down and scrambles after Buster to ride, ride...
I'm not sure exactly what it is, but these old 1940's PRC and MONOGRAM B-Westerns sure have something going for them. Maybe it is that pounding soundtrack music, maybe it's just the comfortable familiar plot, or the same dusty roads, hideouts and towns we're so used to seeing time and again. But I think that it just may be all the old familiar faces that continually pop in and out of these things; Charlie King, Jack Ingram, Kermit Maynard, John Merton, Hal Price, Ted Adams, George Cheseboro, Glenn Strange, Karl Hackett, I. Stanford Jolley, Tris Coffin, Bud Osborne, Ben Corbett, Kenne Duncan, Robert Kortman, Tom London, Steve Clark, Slim Whitaker...well, you get the drift. Women didn't matter. They all were pretty much the same, interchangable, forgotten. The young cowboys in the theater identified with the heroes, sidekicks and especially with the badguys, perhaps because they knew they couldn't ever be that good, or maybe they liked being a little bad; it all seemed so daring. And badguys didn't have to worry about dressing up or having good manners, and they got to belong to a gang.
But even when the heroes and sidekicks changed at PRC and MONOGRAM and became LONE RIDERS, RANGE BUSTERS, TEXAS RANGERS, whatever, there were always the constants; the tinny pounding music, those dusty roads, the town and hideout and best of all, the same BADGUYS, again and again and the kids loved them like old friends, even though they were bad!
So, yeah these two BILLY THE KID/CARSON programmers may not be CITIZEN KANE or some other art film of the 1940's, but if you don't take them seriously and just sit back and enjoy them for what they are, I believe you'll really have some great fun here. Buy and enjoy. I did.",1301443200,,3329,4.672913117546848
