1363174,5,B00004WC7H,"This is truly an epic gem.  A film that not only chronicles a portion of Father Damien's life, but also captures his undying devotion to God.  In a grand way, it is Father Damien's story of selflessly helping those people who were strickened with the terrible disease of leprosy.  In it's quieter moments, it is a reflection of the lives who were touched by the kindness of one man and uplifted by his neverending faith in God.
The film is masterfully photographed by Nino Martinetti and poetically directed by Paul Cox.  With a screenplay by John Briley (Oscar winner for Gandhi) and a brilliant cast featuring David Wenham, Kris Kristofferson, Peter O'toole, Aden Young, Sam Neil, Derek Jacobi, Kate Ceberano and the list goes on.  Even the music is beautifully composed by Paul Grabowsky and Wim Mertens and features a wonderful symphonic score mixed with traditional Hawaiian chanting.
The DVD contains the film in letterbox format (2.35:1) and a wonderfully informative documentary showing the difficulties encountered in filming on location at Kalaupapa on the island of Moloka'i.",983145600,40,1086,5.112994350282486
1363175,3,B00004WC7H,"I watched the film Molokai and did a report on it for school.  From the books that I have read the film seems to show father Damien's life pretty well.  It is a great historical movie.  And it is good to watch it from that point of view.  If you were to watch it in the point of view of ""hot new movie"" you would be let down.  But it is a very intersting movie in that it really shows the way sickness and disease were handled back then.  It also shows how for so long The sick people on Molokai were ignored and forgotten about.  Don't be suprised, it is a very sad movie, and leaves you feeling a little disturbed.  But it is meant to.  It is a movie that had to be made, and I would give it an A for effort.  Pretty landscape views too.",982108800,10,739,3.8993288590604025

1363187,5,B00004WC7H,"This is an amazing movie! Great cast! The acting is superb especially the main character, David Wenham, depicting the Catholic priest, Damien. He displays so much sacrifice, courage and compassion towards the less fortunate. Many may know that leprosy is a contagious disease and at the time of Damien was incurable. He risked his life to care for those with the disease. This poignant movie showed his interactions and daily lifestyle he shared with them and the struggle he had with the government and the Catholic hierarchy to get things changed. The sight of the lepers with their sores and sense of hopelessness was heartbreaking to watch. But Damien, through his Catholic faith, gave them hope and assistance any way that he could. Some may be aware that Damien is a Catholic Saint and I happened to watch this movie on his feast day, May 10. Prepare to experience joy, sadness, anger, compassion, laughter, and love in this touching drama. Thanks Amazon for making this movie available to viewers.",1494460800,5,1004,4.946745562130178

1363203,5,B00004WC7H,"This is a very good movie, well paced and holding your interest in a story that is unknown to many.  Most heroes face terror for a very short time until they are consumed; this man faced his terrible future for years, knowing what awaited him, yet staying on and helping his fellow men

I didn't know what to expect when deciding to view this movie of Father Damien, a Catholic priest who sacrificed his life to help the poorest of the poor; those suffering from the then incurable, insidious, wasting disease of leprosy.  This movie is not only about a man with unimaginable courage, but presents him in a truly human manner, as a regular guy - unassuming, but with a spark, often humorous, that one can only admire.  The movie doesn't try to show him as a plaster saint, unaffected by human desires and failings, but alludes to his struggles to persevere.  The movie, although showing scenes of terrible suffering, avoids the easy dramatic shortcuts to set up villains, but demonstrates how bureaucracies made up of good and decent people can allow terrible practices to exist.

After seeing it, one can well agree with a statement attributed to Ghandi, that ""The political and journalistic world can boast of very few heroes who compare with Father Damien of Molokai.""",1485993600,14,1271,4.780821917808219

1363358,4,B00004WC7H,"Very good in some ways but, in others, it rated only a 3 star.  I gave it 4 because of the authentic footage of leprosy and how the bacteria eats away at the flesh and bone.  However, they should have made a better effort at finding actual Hawaiians or at least more people with a greater percentage of Hawaiian blood.  The lack of them in existence - I know... but, they should have used blacks with some white blood, at least as the extras.  The race was not depicted by even the extras, except for a very few.  In one case, the actor was Japanese.  I mean, really?  Do they think we are that stupid?  The Hawaiians were very dark, almost black.  Depicting them as the overwhelming current multi-racial mix in Honolulu of Filipino-Chinese was rather stupid and ignorant.  It made the movie fake and unbelievable.  If it were not for the photographs of the disease, the rating would have been much less.  Nice to see Kris Kristofferson doing well after all these years and Sam Neill is also always a good choice for a good part.  He was excellent in this movie.",1476489600,,1062,4.4404145077720205

There were some shocking aspects to the story, especially the way he was thwarted  and misused by the high authorities in the British government and some higher-ups in the Catholic church.

A reminder of the vast difference, between ""Religiosity"" and ""Faith In Practice"" . That no matter how long it takes, (for lack of a better term) no matter, in this world of violence, cruelty and neglect, that we inflict on each other daily. Even if it's in one human lifetime or the lifetime of homosapiens on Earth, we are becoming, (for lack of a better term) better human beings.

1363512,5,B00004WC7H,"I had the privilege of being part of a mission group to Molokai in 2007, a small group from our Southern Baptist Church in Oxford, FL. Our Pastor's son, wife and children went to Molokai first as missionaries then were asked to Pastor a small Church there. Our mission group came to work on the Island and help with the outreach from the Church there, worked on the Church gym and help with Children's Church. While there part of our group made the trip to the bottom of some of the highest sea cliffs in the world to Kalaupapa the leper colony. We had to get health certificates from the government and choose to either fly down to the colony or ride mules 2 hours down a steep trail from the top of the 2000 feet sea cliffs. We flew and it was less than 5  minutes of terror and beauty at the same time. This movie portrays the beginning of the hardship and awful treatment of the lepers on Kalaupapa, and the ocean bashing against the rocks are still todays as they were back  when many ships forced lepers overboard out far from the shoreline because of the rocks and rough water, many people died in the water because of the rocks, cold and sharks. At the time of our visit, around 33 lepers still lived on Kalaupapa, visitors were not allowed within the area that these people were confined to. However, at several places, cured lepers worked in the food  stores, museum and bookstore. The grave site of Father Damien was there, as was a cemetery of people who had died there, also the Church was there with the story of Father Damien and the Nuns who continued to work after Father Damien died. Interestingly no other person having worked at Kalaupapa and who tended  the lepers ever got infected by leprosies except for Father Damien. This movie did a great portrayal of the history told today at Kalaupapa about this colonies beginnings and of the selfless devotion and love of  Father Damien , in spite of the lack of the Church's help and the Government of Hawaii during this first leper colony in the USA. I must add this also, the island of Molokai and Kalaupapa are  beautiful, but setting at a table while at  Kalaupapa looking out at the jagged rocks and crashing shoreline covered with rocks, one could still feel the burden of the past oppression and suffering, it was a tangible combination of so much beauty surrounded by so much pain and despair. It made an lasting impression on me and this movie resurfaced that emotion in me.  Well made movie in my opinion.",1473638400,,2481,4.497777777777777

1363525,5,B00004WC7H,"A well-made and touching film about a Christian Catholic priest, Fr. Damien, who sailed from his native Belgium in the late 1800s to work with lepers on the Hawaiian island of Molokai.  The film tells the story of Fr. Damien, who devoted his life to improving the lives of lepers on Molokai, even at the expense of his own health.  Lepers in Hawaii at that time were exiled to the island of Molokai to isolate them from healthy people.  Their living conditions were primitive and they received little medical care until Fr. Damien arrived.  No wonder the state of Hawaii placed a statue of Fr. Damien in statuary hall in the U.S. Capitol.  He was an amazing human being and it is no surprise that recently the Catholic Church declared him to be a saint.",1468627200,11,753,4.548148148148148

I don't buy many movies, but this one was definitely worth the purchase.  I hope to show it to my son when he's older.  This story is truly inspirational and encourages me to be a better person.  Its depiction of Father Damien seems very realistic to me.  He is a very giving man whose strength clearly comes from the Lord.  He has human weaknesses, but he nobly stands his ground when faced with evil and gently cares for others when needed as well.  I couldn't remember how this movie depicted the Catholic Church and was very pleased upon watching it again that it seems to be made from a Catholic perspective.  I only wish I had gotten it sooner.

Damien laments the fact that he had, in the past, criticized the pagan worship widespread at the colony, since he now understands that it seems to give them ""peace.""  He also marries a divorced woman and is OK with it because he states that he'll be dead before he gets disciplined.  Flame me if you must, but this doesn't seem either accurate or inspirational from a character that would become a saint.  Throw in topless natives (which might have been accurate, though inappropriate in a family film) and the obligatory ""tempt the priest"" scenes, and it makes for some heavy editing to get down to the core message: compassion for the poor in body and spirit.  After editing this on iMovie, I would give it 3 stars for the production, acting, and underlying message, but I can't recommend it to serious minded individuals and families if left unedited.",1425340800,11,929,4.716049382716049

I asked our tour leader John who the Damien and Marianne of Ebola may turn out to be.  Such selflessness is needed. Too bad it is often criticized instead of celebrate.

1363566,4,B00004WC7H,"Molokai is the inspirational true story of a great man with a heart for God and man. Father Damienn, at 33, volunteers to go to Molokai to serve as the priest for the colony of lepers. At first the church plans to bring a priest in for 3 months and replace him with another priest, but Father Damien's heart for the people refuses to let him leave. His bishop warns him not to touch anyone, but his heart breaks for the people, and he, like Christ, reaches out to them literally. Not only are they outcasts exiled from humanity on the island of Molokai, but they have little food, rags for clothing, little shelter, no beds, and mostly no medicine. The government has sent them--men, women, and children-- there to die.

  Not only does Damien contend with the leprosy, but with politicians who want to look good while covering up how bad the situation is, by some church authorities who are more concerned about their status than about service, by forced prostitution, theft by thugs, churchmen, and greedy storekeepers, lack of food, clothing and shelter, loneliness, and at times anger and a shaky faith. While both church and government assert that the lepers are receiving help from the other, often Damien receives neither.

  David Wenham plays Father Damien convincingly. Peter O'Toole, always exceptional, is a dying Anglican whom Father Damien befriends. The acting is well done, but the movie covers so much time that I don't feel we really get a picture of Damien and his personal struggles as sharply as we could. That's why I gave the movie 4 stars. For instance, when Damien is told that if he goes back to the island, he will spend the rest of his life there, Damien flinches but does not hesitate to do his duty. That changes as the movie nears the end, and Damien discovers that he does have leprosy. We see more of his struggles. He takes on his supervisor and defies the hierarchy by marrying a repentant thug and his live-in divorced girlfriend.

  It's a good movie that I shared with my teenage daughter, but it didn't grab my heart like Amistad did. It's well worth seeing, might even be good to show a youth group the intense love of God and man that one man can possess. Because of the prostitution, the scarring, and one attempted seduction scene, parents may wish to show this to the older members of the family after the little ones are in bed. We, even non-Catholics like myself, need heroes like Father Damien whose love of God and his compassion for suffering people inspire us to love God and serve others more.",1403654400,,2544,4.635555555555555

1363578,5,B00004WC7H,"This is a detailed biography of Joseph Veuster, a Belgian who became a Catholic priest and took the name of Damien. He became a missionary at his own desire and was sent by his superior to Hawaii. Leprosy, then an incurable disease, slowly destroying the body, was not uncommon in Hawaii  and a leper colony was established by the government in a remote promontory on the island, which was difficult of access. There the lepers lived a squalid and isolated life, outcasts. Damien volunteered to go there. He was warned not to have any physical contact with the lepers and permitted to go for a very short period. He went there, made it his task to look after the lepers, not only spiritually but in every way as one of them. He battled with the government to get better conditions and endured disapproval from the bishop and his religious superior who had little idea of what conditions were like in the colony and thought of him as a nuisance. He contracted leprosy himself after some years and died in the colony. This book gives a dispassionate and vivid account of his life. He is now internationally recognised or his selfless care and the hardships he willingly underwent. He is commemorated in Haaii and by a statue in Washington and he has been dsignated a saint by his Church. This book is well worth reading andis memorable",1388275200,3,1333,4.648305084745763

Hansen's disease or Leprosy as it is commonly referred to is an agonizing disease that touched many in its day.  However, none as famous as Father Damian who also afflicted with Hansen's, compassionately cared for, with many wonderful nurses and nuns, these richly cultured Hawaiian people.

It is not for the faint hearted due to the graphic display of human suffering.  Keep a sniffle tissue in hand.

Filmed on the original leper colony on the island of Molokai it is breathtakingly picturesque as all of Hawaii is.

Yes, the story is a sad one.  Innocents plagued by a terrible, debilitating and ultimately terminal disease.

Filmed on location at the leprosy colony on Molokai.  Little remains of the origianl settlement on the wetter side of the peninsula where Damien actually landed, but some scenes are filmed in the portion of the chapel that Damien himself helped build.

The film works hard to portray the sense of fear and isolation surrounding leprosy.

1363618,4,B00004WC7H,"""Father Damien"" is an excellent biopic on the Roman Catholic priest who agreed to live his life among the lepers of Molokai in Hawai'i. The film will cause viewers to ask themselves many questions about the value of sacrifice for one's fellow human beings.

There are many positive aspects of ""Father Damien."" The entire cast is excellent; David Wenham, as Damien, rises to the challenge of portraying an extraordinary figure. The film is beautiful; it seems as though it would be easy to film a beautiful movie in Hawai'i, but the filmmakers exceeded my expectations. The wonderful Hawaiian music that the filmmakers used helps provide the right atmosphere.

It is possible to mention a few drawbacks. At two hours, the film is a bit long; I thought that the filmmakers could have cut at least fifteen minutes without losing much impact. ""Father Damien"" covers both Damien's activities on Molokai and the (disappointing) actions of the Roman Catholic Church in Honolulu; at times, the filmmakers' attempts to tell two stories at once can be a bit jarring to the viewer.

I've never been entirely comfortable with the idea of elevating people to sainthood. But, if anyone deserves such an honor, certainly Father Damien qualifies.

The film was made in 1999. The first DVD version, by A-PIX  Entertainment, had the film in Letterbox wide screen 2:35. There were Spanish subtitles, which is good. But there were no English subtitles, which neglected the hearing impaired viewers.

The DVD was done over in 2008, by Gateway Films. The scenes were divided up differently, which is okay. And the Spanish subtitles were replaced by English ones. Maybe they could have had both. But the worst part is the switch from Letterbox to Full Frame.

In one early scene, about 6 minutes into the film, a group of priests are sitting in a church listening to their bishop. The Letterbox version shows five priests in the first row: three on one side of the aisle, and two on the other. The Full Frame version shows two priests on one side, and one and a half on the other.

Why is there still an excuse to do Full Frame DVDs? What they did in an insult to the cinematography and integrity of the film. If you can find it, get the earlier Letterbox version, even without the English subtitiles.",1238716800,9,1171,4.530805687203792

1363626,5,B00004WC7H,"""Molokai"" is not so much about Father Damian, as it is about the importance of compassion towards those, who find themselves as ""unfortunates"" through no fault of their own. That Father Damian defied his superiors in defense of the lepers sent to the then remote island colony on Molokai, says volumes about the man's convictions on their account. He spent years among them, improving their standard of living (which was best described as ""squalor"", before his arrival), and bringing many into the fold of Christianity, before succumbing to the disease himself.

Sam Neil, Peter O'Toole and Kris Kristofferson give fine performances. It is David Wenham, however, that deserves special mention. His performances in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy were good, but hardly an indicator of his abilities. In ""Molokai"", his performance as Father Damian is superb!

1363630,1,B00004WC7H,"Please,
 read through before you reject what I have to say!
I have no doubt that this Netherlands produced independent film had all of the earnestness of Mother Theresa.
 Father Damien arrived in 1873 to the 7 year old leper colony founded in Kalaupapu'ua Molokai,Hawaii. As a Catholic Missionary,Damien worked among the people eventually contacting the disease and dying from influenza in 1886. Aided by a precious few that came years later, Damien was able to build a parish Church and establish housing on the island. Today,Molokai is an island that requires you to take the Damien tour for $40 as a prerequisite for visiting the island.
But as a film,strictly, this is a very low budget project and it shows. John Briley's screenplay which is freely adapted from Hilde Eynirel's Dutch  source material is extremely rudimentary and Paul Cox's direction follows suit. The acting naturally follows in the same venue,rigid and embarrassingly dull. Even director of photography,Nino Martinelli, apart from pan-scan shots of the island,unfortunately,has every scene and actor on a predetermined mark to deliver their lines...and that is what the actors do. Tom Wilkinson,Peter O'Toole,Jan Decleir,Alice Krige and Derek Jacobi are simply bad in this film that under another director with different funding may have been far more compelling than what it really was. I do not fault the actors who did what they were told to do. This is where I would lay the total fault of this production at the feet of director Paul Cox. Unfortunately, the earnestness of the project is hampered by lack of funding and ultimately static camera work and poor direction. It is needlessly long and lacks any real tension build up. The film is as static as static can be.
Paul Grabowski and Wil Mertens do,though,provide some nice soundtrack material.
It is a shame,because what Father Damien did was quite unselfish and heroic;but a film is a film,and this one really lacks in professional quality. Sorry. I doubt that after one viewing that you will return to Molokai AS A FILM.",1172275200,14,2056,5.041176470588235
1363631,3,B00004WC7H,"This video had very fine location photography.  I visited the actual site so I know they had to film in a different location than the actual leper colony that still exists because that has been modernized.

Again, I feel the weak point of the video was that it was based on the book by the same name.  I don't feel the book should have been the only source.  They should have looked for other sources for the screenplay as the book is weak.  It had big name actors in it.  That was impressive.

But it just didn't get me emotionally involved with Father Damien and I feel that is necessary for a good film.",1168473600,7,606,4.2631578947368425
1363632,5,B00004WC7H,"This biography of Father Damien, the Catholic priest who in 1873 volunteered for service on the Hawaiian leper colony of Molokai. For 15 years Damien ministered nearly single-handedly to the quarantined community, supplying what medication he could procure while struggling against the red tape from organizations (religious and governmental) that would rather have forgotten all about the thousands of people dying in primitive conditions. He won some battles and lost others, finally succumbing to the disease himself in 1888.

The films earnestness led to the who's-who supporting cast (Sam Neill, Derek Jacobi, Peter O'Toole, Leo McKern, Kate Ceberano and Kris Kristofferson), but it is David Wenham who must carry the film as Damien, which he does spectacularly and with a touching humility, but with the spirit to fight for those he serves, in the midst of such conflict. Director Paul Cox was inspired in his choices of choosing scenes to highlight 15 years in a single film not two hours long. He uses amazing cinematographic tools to convey the story and the passage of time, a tree stand planted by Damien, the many construction projects he carries out, and watching `Little Bishop' grow up and pass away. Pay particular attention to the music, and the use of the sound of the wind as the film progresses.

This is a story of faith and of service. If you want a film that will challenge your spirit and cause you to examine your own life in the light of the service given by others you could not pick a better film.

The Toronto Globe and Mail stated about the film ""A Triumph of the Human Spirit!"" Though this film did well at the film festivals it had little or no mainstream release in North America.

It shows Fr. Damien as a very human person, but one who loves his vocation, his faith, his God, and his fellow man. It is very inspiring. The scene where Fr. Damien trys to rescue leprosy victims thrown into the sea off a ship is haunting.

David Wenham is perfect. After becoming familiar with him as Faramir, I thought it would be difficult to not see him as such in this film. But he has a total transformation and there's not a speck of 'Faramir' in him in this film. As a matter of fact it is hard to imagine that it is the same person. He portrays Fr.

1363637,4,B00004WC7H,"Molokai is the story of a priest, Father Damien, who chose to spend his life serving in a leper colony.  The movie is a heroic story of great compassion and persistence in the face of physical hardship and isolation.  Filmed on location on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai, the scenery is gorgeous, and it touches on the history and culture of Hawaii.  I found the movie very, very moving, but some may find the conditions of the lepers too depressing to bear.
An Australian, David Wehan plays the role of Damien.  Two other actors you may recognize are Kris Kristofferson and Peter O'Toole, who both play lepers.  Peter O'Toole, who I never like previously, seems to have really enjoyed his role.
Molokai is one of the more remote Hawaiian Islands.  During a leprosy epidemic in Hawaii during the mid-nineteenth century, the government established a peninsula on the island of Molokai as a leper colony.  It was chosen because it was so difficult to get to or escape from.
In the movie, there is a scene where, instead of transferring the lepers to rowboats, the crew forced the lepers at gunpoint to jump overboard and swim to shore.  These included women and children.  In the actual historical incident, some people drowned, some died from injuries from being bashed against the rocks on the beach, and others died on shore of exhaustion.  Although not shown in the movie, often, ships depositing lepers would tie a rope from the ship to land and the lepers had to climb hand-over-hand to shore.
Father Damien had grown up on a farm in Belgium.  He was very strong physically and was an experienced carpenter and builder. Before going to Molokai, the historical Father Damien had been a parish priest and pastor in several parishes in the Hawaiian Islands.  He learned to speak Hawaiian and understood native Hawaiian culture. In the opening sequence of the movie, Father Damien is shown helping some Hawaiians build a house.  Bounty hunters arrive on horseback to take away suspected lepers.  Villagers run and hide.  The scene is reminiscent of the slave catchers in Roots.  Historically, before going to Molokai, Damien experienced parishioners being taken away to the colony, and he had assisted people in avoiding the bounty hunters (not shown in the movie).
Father Damien volunteered to be assigned to Molokai.  Damien's bishop instructed him to take all measures to avoid infection.  In the movie, we see Damien simply ignoring the instructions.  In historical fact, after two months on the island, he formally requested permission from the bishop to risk infection.  He did this because it was the only way he could gain the lepers trust.
The leper colony was a living hell.  When Damien arrived in 1873, there were six hundred lepers with inadequate housing and food, and no doctors, nurses, or medical supplies.  Essentially, there was no law.  Gangs of physically able lepers looted the belongings of the very sick.  Prostitution and pedophilia were rampant.  The bodies of the dead were either thrown into a ravine or buried very shallowly, where they were dug up and eaten by wild pigs.  To be sure, with the arrival of Damien, there was a significant improvement in the lives of the lepers, but in the historical reality, the conditions and problems Damien faced were far worse than depicted in the movie.
Besides serving as priest, Damien's construction worker skills were invaluable.  He built, supervised, or organized volunteer labor to build hundreds of buildings-over half the buildings in the settlement.  When he arrived, there was no running water.  He built a pipeline (In the movie, there is no pipeline).  Damien cleaned and bandaged wounds and amputated gangrenous limbs.  The son of a farmer, he taught the lepers to grow crops (not shown in the movie).  He was the island's undertaker, funeral director, grave digger, and coffin maker-he built over 1,600 coffins.  He also witnessed seven murders (not shown in the movie).
Besides having no resources to care for the sick, Damien had constant conflicts with both the government health authorities and his own religious order.  In addition, he had many critics in the medical and clerical professions.  The Hawaiian government's board of health didn't like him simply because he made them look bad.  He alone was accomplishing orders of magnitude more for the lepers than the whole state government.  His religious order was not able to provide any other permanent people to help, until near the end of his life.  To their credit, they tried, but the only other people they could get to go to Molokai were misfits that were so bad, Damien sent them back.  The order had other priests in Hawaii doing good work, and they didn't like Damien getting all the publicity.
 Father Damien did not go to the leper colony just care for their bodies, although he did so tirelessly.  He also went to save their souls.  In the movie, it is very moving to see Damien administer the Sacraments.  He buries lepers with half-bodies of rotting flesh, with all of the dignity and respect that one would expect to be given a member of high society in Paris or Rome.  Actual historical witnesses on Molokai said that Damien said Mass every day with the utmost reverence and liturgical decorum in a tiny chapel filled with lepers bleeding and spitting, with Damien seemingly oblivious to an almost unbearable stench of rotting human flesh.
 Since 1944, medicines have been developed that stop leprosy from being contagious and spreading within the body.  The colony on Molokai was disbanded in 1969.  At the time of the filming, there were forty-seven surviving patients from the settlement.  Today, they are free to come and go as they please, although they all feel like outcasts shunned by society.  A number appeared as extras in the movie.  Today, Hawaiians consider Damien to be one of the great heroes of their state.",1026604800,204,5882,4.915821501014198

1363639,5,B00004WC7H,"When I ordered this DVD I knew a bit about the life of Fr. Damien but nothing about the film.  I expected it to be ""pleasant fare"" but not much better.  What a surprise! Molokai is as near to being a perfect film as could ever be made. It is an interesting and inspiring story that is told without any of the over-sentimentality one might expect from a ""religious"" film.  The screenplay is wonderful - absolutely believable and natural dialoge delivered flawlessly. The cinematography is breathtaking and the soundtrack is, well, I'm going to track it down to buy it - a first for me.  So much for the technical stuff.  Fr. Damien was an extraordinary individual and an ideal priest.  The film portrays this with great respect as it does with the Catholic Church in general - another rarity these days!  There are at least a dozen scenes that stand out as illustrations of true virtue in practice and from which we can draw inspiration to improve our own characters.  This is a beautiful film in every sense and will remain in my top 10 list of all time great movies.",994291200,116,1067,4.520833333333333
1363640,5,B00004WC7H,"In a modern world where money and success are now the only goals for many people this reminds us of the story of a man who gave up everything, ultimately his life, simply to care for those who had leprosy. The worst thing about this disease is that those who have it are often cast out from their homes & families for whom the stigma is such that they would rather them have died. It was like this at the time of Fr Damien and in many parts of the world is still like this today. Don't forget to watch the Making of Molokai which is also on the DVD.",991612800,21,549,4.0
1363641,3,B00004WC7H,"This movie has a couple of scenes that will stick with you for your life.  I strongly recommend it, even though I gave it 3 stars. It seems the makers of the movie tried to make a compromise between the historical facts and the emotional struggles of Father Damien. This compromise takes the edge away the movie would potentially have had: after the movie, you still don't know WHY did he go and live amongst the lepers, not something you do for fun or personal glory, is it? I my opinion this movie tends towards a dramatized documentary, but as I said definitely worth watching if you are tired of all the sex and violence that Hollywood has been pooring out these days.",985737600,12,672,4.463414634146342

7925012,5,B00004WC7H,"This is a fine film that reveals a little about the sad lives of those afflicted with leprosy and the heroism of those, like Catholic priest Fr. Damien, who gave up everything to serve them and help them. Wonderfully acted (especially David Wenham as Fr. Damien) and beautifully filmed in Hawaii and starring a host of famous actors, this is one to watch over and over again. Fr. Damien, like so many before him, wound up with the disease himself and died in 1889. He was declared a saint in 2009 by Pope Benedict after the necessary two miracles were associated with his posthumous intercession. The film also shows the heroism of the religious sisters such as Marianne Cope (also a saint now) who cared for the leprosy victims. A truly inspiring film!",1519171200,,753,4.669172932330827

From the start of the movie where he volunteers to go to Molokai, I cried--I just LOST it: how could we NOT give everything it takes, or at least everything we can, to save souls, to comfort the dying, and prove to the disenfranchised that though they be poor, sick or different, they are absolutely PRECIOUS in the eyes of God.",1513987200,,475,4.642857142857143
