8367312,4,B002EAYDTI,"Dostoyevsky's great novel transferred to L.A.  It follows the original fairly closely.  The biggest drawback is the Porfiry character, a virtual lightweight contrasted with Edward Arnold or John Hurt in other movie versions.  It could have been much worse.  Worth the viewing.",1479772800,,276,5.5
8367313,5,B002EAYDTI,Good movie.  I bought this because Barry Atwater is in it.,1461196800,,58,4.2727272727272725
8367314,5,B002EAYDTI,"Transfers a great deal of the original Russian work to modern day Santa Monica. It's really wonderful to see how Walter Newman (the screenwriter) and the Sanders brothers copy the original and paste it onto 1950s Santa Monica beach life and sensibilities. Very impressive. The Gibran touch was very 50s!  George Hamilton does a good job. See him before he had his teeth fixed! But the most amazing part of the film is the scene he has with Frank Silvera, who through his amazingly subtle interrogation causes Hamilton to crack. I recorded and played back this scene at least fifty times until I memorized it back in 1961-62. The film inspired me to read the original all the way through, and then I re-read it!
Frank Silvera's greatest performance. He did a few TV shows before his untimely death in a car accident. I love this movie.",1442448000,,834,4.673469387755102
8367315,3,B002EAYDTI,"More like a 2.5, we really should have more choices as far as stars....but, anyway....I got this 1959 movie all because of George Hamilton, I loved him back in the day. I had never seen this movie and I think I know why. George is pretty good as the man who thinks that there are superior people that should have the right to rid society of the inferior. The support players seem very amateurish, there is, for instance, a very silly cat and mouse game with a cop and he is a ""Columbo"" ripoff, for sure and not anywhere as entertaining. He is just aggravating. The movie is at times painfully dull. The acting even by George seemed manic and too frenetic at times that didn't call for it. The ending...just plain dumb.",1432857600,,718,4.406015037593985
8367316,4,B002EAYDTI,"Remember this obscure little movie from 1962 or so - not a great one, but just wanted it for the sake of nostalgia.",1374451200,,115,4.043478260869565
8367317,2,B002EAYDTI,"George Hamilton's first movie role and a pretty challenging one at that.  His acting was the strong part of the
movie.  The storyline was weak and not convincing.  The other actors were pretty dull in their roles.  All-in-all
not a good use of time.  Buy WHERE THE BOYS ARE or LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA instead.  George Hamilton is just as
good in the movies and the storylines are far better.",1366675200,,387,4.457142857142857
