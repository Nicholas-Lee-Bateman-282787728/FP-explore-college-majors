7926886,3,B00004Y7CV,"These two episodes have two things in common: Popular guest stars, and leading roles for the often underused Greg Morris.

The Killer (episode #105) is poorly paced. When a downtown hotel becomes transformed into the hotel Robert Conrad picked at random from the phone book, we get to see every detail of the work. But at the end, the climax of the episode feels very rushed. Not enough Leonard Nimoy in this one, but Morris gets some screen time as the substitute for the killer's target, and Conrad shows off his version of a half-crazy bad guy.

In Cocaine (episode #156), guest star Barbara Anderson lures eternal tomcat William Shatner into a fake drug score in order to uncover the details of a real drug deal. (Lynda Day-George is a no-show for this episode.) Morris gets a pivotal role as the almost-incorruptible vice squad agent. I thought the ending got a little muddy, including a full-cast curtain call for no apparent reason.

Maybe the series had jumped the shark by the time it reached these episodes, and I'm sure these shouldn't be in the Top 25 All-Time. But it's not so bad to see some early 1970s guest stars having fun pretending to be evil.",1123027200,,1163,4.663414634146341
7926887,4,B00004Y7CV,"The first episode is one of the classics of these great series.  Interestingly enough, when the series was revived in 1988 with Peter Graves again starring as the IMF leader, the episode was an almost exact remake of the first episode on this video.  Frankly, I thought the remake was better mainly because Robert Conrad plays a better ""good guy"" than the ""bad guy"" he is in this episode.
The second episode with William Shatner is not as good.  One reason is because Mission: Impossible coincided with the War in Vietnam and after the War became extrememly controversial, it was announced that the producers of the show would no longer do stories  about the IMF overthrowing evil governments and leaders in foreign countries (not politically correct in 1970's America!) which was a high percentage of their episodes, but from now on would rather would focus on the fight against organized crime.  Since now all the resources of the IMF, which had previously been able to defeat the intellegence forces and even armies of bad foreign regimes would now be focused on bringing down one or few bad guys, it almost makes you feel sorry for these evildoers because they don't stand a chance!  That is the case in this episode.  However, there is no such thing as a ""bad"" episode of Mission: Impossible so it is still very entertaining.",1043366400,,1330,4.781659388646288
7926888,5,B00004Y7CV,"The first episode on the tape is the fifth-season classic, ""The Killer,"" starring Robert Conrad as a hired assasin who carries out his assignments in a totally improvised fashion, leaving the IMF scrambling every second of the way in their mission to discover the identity of his boss.  The customization of a hotel in a matter of minutes is the highlight of this episode, an excellent rehash of ""Operation Rogosh"" (volume 8).  The second show, ""Cocaine,"" stars William Shatner as a drug-smuggling assistant taken in by an IMF cocaine-manufacturing machine that, naturally, doesn't quite work to specifications.  An enjoyable and complicated mission highlighted by an unusually effective Shatner as the heavy, Barabara (""Ironside"") Anderson as a drug addict, and Peter Lupus as the instructive, bespectacled chemist who makes the ""cocaine.""  Great fun.",980553600,,852,5.431818181818182
