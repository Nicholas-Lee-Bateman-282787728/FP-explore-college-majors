8739400,4,B004I9FMB6,I really liked this story - it was one with a young cast and adult cast.  Problem for me is I ALWAYS like the young cast better and it is hard to adjust to the new adult characters.  The mother with issues was amazing - you love her and hate her.  I had a little trouble with the whole pretending to be bother/sister to appease the other crazy mom but still liked the story a lot!,1398556800,,380,3.973684210526316
8739401,4,B004I9FMB6,"Because this is an interesting story, I recommend it, but I am confused about the title.  As I recall, there is only one ""snow"" scene and hardly any mention of Christmas; but, don't let that dissuade you from watching the series.  This was my introduction to Go-Soo, and I am now a big fan as a result.  He has an expressionless face while the eyes say it all, which, to me, makes for an interesting acting interpretation.  The story has all the components of the Kdramas we love to watch -- abandonment, betrayal, devotion, honor, and dedication.",1374451200,,547,4.608247422680412

8739403,4,B004I9FMB6,"This is a good melodrama with a good story line. But I must say, the ending left me a bit confused and frustrated. The drama is about youthful love, tragedy, separation, reunion, and a painful struggle with the past that keeps the characters from being together. Go Soo, the lead male, was excellent. Never heard of him before but I enjoyed his acting. Han Ji-Wan, the main character (Han Ye-Seul played this part), started out as a strong-willed, courageous, and compulsive schoolgirl but as the drama progressed, this character weakened, which was disappointing. This seems to happen in many K-Dramas. Still, a good drama.",1358985600,,624,5.009615384615385
