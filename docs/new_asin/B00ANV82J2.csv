8554948,1,B00ANV82J2,"I am sure my son would have enjoyed this DVD as he is a big Annoying Orange fan, but we have not been able to view it as it is only suitable for zone 1 (i.e. USA) and we live in zone 2 (Europe). Unless there is an all zones version I will be returning the product. We had thought about buying other Annoying Orange DVDs but clearly unless they are suitable for our zone , this would be a complete waste of time.",1392595200,,411,3.9047619047619047

8554951,3,B00ANV82J2,"At some point in time there was a change in TV viewing for children. While a huge number of kids went through life watching things like SPACE GHOST, THE HERCULOIDS, HUCKLEBERRY HOUND, YOGI BEAR and JONNY QUEST we were apparently left uneducated by these shows. Do-gooders would have none of this and so made it their life's work to make sure that only educational, informative and mind altering shows would follow. All shows must have a message and that message must advance civilization. The result was that kids have grown up with the lamest of shows and most of us have increased the size of our personal DVD collections with collections of the classics that we share with our kids.

Once in a while something different comes along though in spite of the do-gooders. Such is the case with ANNOYING ORANGE. I'm not sure I can find a single socially redeeming moment of value in any of the episodes that I watched here. My guess is that those seeking that sort of thing will be sorely disappointed in the show and offer some blistering attacks on the stupidity that a piece of grade school mentality spewing fruit offers to kids.

But they're missing the point. These jokes are not aimed at adults. They're aimed at kids! I think far too many adults these days miss the fact that when you were a kid you were supposed to have fun. Instead we want all children to be math wizards and literary geniuses before they even begin going to school. So when do kids get that chance to have fun?

Annoying Orange is just what his title proclaims him to be, a piece of talking fruit that spews out annoying things to his friends, other fruits that have the ability to speak. Much like the old SPACE ANGEL program from way back, the show features fruits and vegetables with superimposed mouths that speak the lines. And trust me when I say the lines aren't Shakespeare. They're rather harmless jokes and youngsters will laugh at and probably repeat over and over again until and orange isn't the most annoying thing in the room. But that's all part of being a kid.

There are plenty of different ideas crammed into various episodes here that take us from knights of old to a pirate ship battle in a grocery store when the lights go out. Each offers a smidgen of talent and plenty of grade school laughs that kids will love. So I'll be one of the few that says as an adult I didn't enjoy the antics of Annoying Orange enough to want to visit him frequently but my guess is kids will watch this DVD over and over again.",1365897600,4,2506,4.489035087719298
8554952,4,B00ANV82J2,I've been a fan of the webseries since it came out 3 years ago. The puns on the show were always clever and maybe there is just something in my that enjoys seeing fruit and veggies knifed. Excited to see it move on to Cartoon Network. The puns and parody's are still there but the level of action has really taken off. This show has such a bigger feel it's great. Adding Tobuscus to the show was a great move. Bought this DVD for my friend's young boys and not ashamed to admit I picked up a copy of myself as well. Pretty funny stuff here and cool VFX,1363910400,,552,4.073394495412844
8554953,5,B00ANV82J2,"I don't know if we loved this show the very first time we watched it but we are die hard fans for the past 10 months.  We found the Annoying Orange on You Tube last year and thought; what the.....h-e-c-k?  As strange as we thought it was, we couldn't stop watching.  We really are not sure why these creepy faced fruits and veggies are popular but they are.

The show focuses on Orange and his friends which include Marshmallow, Pear, Grandpa Lemon and others.  While the characters are mostly obnoxious, we often find ourselves laughing out loud at their craziness. It is very witty and my husband and I don't mind watching with the kids in the least.

While some found this offensive in the beginning due to the name calling; ""you're such an Apple"" says one fruit to the apple. It really is just funny and has the Dove Foundation Family seal of approval!
