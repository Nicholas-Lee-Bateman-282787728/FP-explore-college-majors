Just kidding! There is more. One of my roommates' native language is Malayalam and while she is very busy all of the time and c an never sit and watch anything with the rest of us I asked if she would ever be able to watch a movie in Malayalam with us while she still worked. She said yes! And then she set out to find one of her favorite Malayalam films-- and apparently she did not get it from Amazon (because it isn't available on here right now) but she found Bangalore Days and ordered it.

This was an excellent film! There was so much depth to the characters and while the film moved you emotionally it was still able to make you laugh. My roommate has said in the past that there are not that many ""good"" Malayalam movies.... but if there are more like this one, well... they have a really great thing going!",1506470400,,852,4.220858895705521
