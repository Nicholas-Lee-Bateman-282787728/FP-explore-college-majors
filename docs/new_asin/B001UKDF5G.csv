3802763,5,B001UKDF5G,"This 25 minute video was an extremely helpful video in my practice as a doula and a massage therapist.  After having done my doula training, I was in need of a video that displayed real examples of touch that encouraged the laboring process, calmed the mother's spirits and provided general support and comfort to the laboring woman.  Most labor support videos only show basic breathing, ritual and rhythm techniques for calming a woman in labor, but I felt as though this video really emphasized the importance of touch and nurturing support.  Not only are there water births, home births and hospital births displayed in this video but the film truly leaves the viewer with an understanding of the importance of nurturing touch no matter the location one chooses to birth.
I was shown a very positive and inspiring view of the birth process in this film while feeling encouraged to become more involved in helping women have healthy and successful births.  This is an excellent film for massage therapists, doulas, midwives and birth educators.  Enjoy!!!!",1247529600,7,1057,5.017142857142857
8344107,5,B001UKDF5G,I watched this video during my doula workshop and had to buy it. If you've ever had a baby you will ball your eyes out. So much raw emotion.

8344109,5,B001UKDF5G,"I first read Leslie's book, Nurturing Massage for Pregnancy, and then watched this video. Being a visually oriented person, I appreciated seeing the fruition of what the techniques in the book had prepared a woman for. This video is a great complement to the book, for as good as it is, it just can't convey what it's like to have masterful hands administer caring touch to women enacting what might be the most profound ritual of their lives.

Share this video and its companion, MotherTouch: Touch Techniques for Birth, with the family and friends of the mother to be, as it will help engage them in the birthing ritual in a caring and supportive way.",1372723200,,653,4.678260869565217

I've been told of whole classrooms of birth professionals crying when watching this empowering footage of 4 women birthing, including a remarkable scene of a woman spiraling her hips around her baby as she births it while standing in a pool.

Each birth is has its own compelling imagery,  from the hospital birth with a young frightened couple, to a home birth with a strong woman who delivered standing, while surrounded by at least 5 women touching her continuously.

8344116,5,B001UKDF5G,"Nurturing Touch for Birth is a seamless, moving film. The filmmakers have woven together footage of women receiving massage during their labors and births, the women's feedback about their experience of touch during labor, and insights from midwives and birth attendants. A variety of births, including hospital births, home births and water births make this film accessible to a diverse audience. As a massage therapist who has attended many births, I think this film is so beautiful and encouraging! I'm excited to share it with my pregnant clients as an aid to encouraging them in creating a supportive, empowering birth. In addition to showing how confident women felt after births where they were supported by nurturing touch, the film demonstrates how successful and soulful a woman-centered birth can be. Furthermore, Nurturing Touch for Birth is a wonderful tool for women (and their supporters) preparing for birth because it illustrates the stages of labor and birth and prepares women for a positive experience where mother and baby are dearly valued.",1249084800,2,1062,5.289940828402367
