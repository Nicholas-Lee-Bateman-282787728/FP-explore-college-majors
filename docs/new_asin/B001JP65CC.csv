As idiotic as my script was, and it was embarrassingly stupid, it was 1000 times better than this piece of CRAP. Without any doubt, this is the STUPIDEST most BORING POINTLESS RIDICULOUS movie I have EVER seen. In my ENTIRE LIFE! How did this get onto Amazon? I mean, can ANYONE put up a  movie here, like 7-year-olds who make up plots with NO DIALOG? What. The. Hell. did I just see? Where do I get that hour of my life back?",1496707200,,492,4.072164948453608

8313267,5,B001JP65CC,"Not a ""kid's Disney movie"" like Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. This musical has two levels of story, a weaving of fun/familiar fairy tales with deeper themes (be careful what you wish for, responsibility for your decisions and actions, parent-child relationships, romantic relationships ... and much more). Was unfamiliar with the play - picked the movie almost solely on Meryl Streep's reputation and got much more than we expected. Who knew she could sing? Music and vocals were wonderful (Cinderella's and Rapunzel's princes were priceless in ""Agony"" - straight out of Old Spice commercials). Can't wait for it to come out on DVD so we can enjoy it again.",1425081600,3,667,5.018018018018018
8313268,1,B001JP65CC,"My kids and I settled in for a relaxing evening to be charmed by the latest Disney musical flick. As the story went on, the more and more horrific it became - certainly not appropriate for children! I kept waiting to see Anna Kendrick (Cinderella) and Meryl Streep (the witch), but could never clearly identify the characters as such. Kudos to the makeup department, but poor work by the screenwriters in communicating your characters to the audience.

Disney, get it together.",1420156800,6,477,4.888888888888889
