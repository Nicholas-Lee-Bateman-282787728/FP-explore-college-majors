1934921,3,B0000E5NPY,"I am going to copy and paste this in every season of Dawson's Creek. Understand I am a fan of 90210 the originals series, Vampire Diaries, The Originals, NCIS, The 100, Utopia, Bones, Continuum just to name a few. I ordered all 6 seasons of Dawson's Creek and began watching them. I understand this is an old T.V. series and I am playing catch up, but there is a reason I have never heard of this show. Pros I enjoy watching shows with the ins and outs of growing up and all the pain it brings, this show does that to a certain extent. The show also brings into light some of the pains homosexual kids face when growing up. Now for the Cons. At best this show was nothing more than a copy cat of 90210 as a matter of fact 90210 was actually mentioned in the show. You will also notice that you can skip a season or two and never truly miss anything.  You know when you sit down and start watching a bad movie but you force yourself through it hoping that it gets good soon ""I found myself in this very situation on more then one occasion"". The love triangle between the three main characters killed the series for me, much like the first couple of seasons of the Vampire Diaries. However, the Vampire Diaries had a story behind each show outside of the love triangle that somewhat held it together. The story line always came second to the love triangle in Dawson's Creek and for the most part the story lines were garbage. Some more bad news for the show; you would be hard pressed to find one 15 year old in high school with a vocabulary of a 30 year old English professor, but not in this show they all do. If it weren't for the last season 2 stars at best.  I recommend this series only if you have time to waste.",1425081600,,1717,4.2

1934925,5,B0000E5NPY,Great Show! I grew up (through high school and beyond) watching Dawson's Creek and I have to say it is one of my favorite Teenage Dramas.

I'M 40+ AND THOUGHT THE SHOW WOULD BE WORTH WATCHING (LIKE GILMORE GIRLS AND FELICITY) IN MY ""OLD"" AGE, BUT THE CHARACTERS WERE NOT VERY LIKEABLE.

1934940,4,B0000E5NPY,"I have to say that this season is a major improvement over the first. After watching the first season, I wasn't super excited about starting the second. I was pretty annoyed by several of the characters, and the drama was a little too cheesy at times (I knew it would be, but some of the dialogue and scenes in the first season were just too corny).
However, the second season really expands the storyline (i.e. focuses less on specific characters), and it also brings a bunch of new elements into the story. The issues presented in this season are far more complex than those in the first, and there just seems to be a lot more going on in this one. I was glad to see the introduction of some new characters and scenarios, which helped to propel the season forward and add some diversity.
The reason that I am only giving this 4 stars is that I was still a little irked by some of the characters, especially Dawson. Though the dialogue is smart and well-done, it just doesn't fit high school students, and I was further annoyed by the fact that all the characters talk about how analytical they are, but they do little more than that.
However, this season was way better than the first, and if you weren't a fan of the first, try this one out.",1395878400,,1244,4.3896103896103895

I am already on the 5th season.  Like any series some episodes are excellent and some are just okay.  This series is mostly about kids in high school and their families.  Things have not changed a lot except the teens did not have cell phones and DVD's.  They actually talked instead of text messaging.  I think this is good viewing for all ages.",1391299200,,516,4.09

1934966,5,B0000E5NPY,"If I had to rank the seasons, season two would be on the top of my list followed by season one.

 Season two had Dawson and Joey breaking up, making up and then breaking up. Abbey Morgan at her best. It's a shame that Monica Keena missed her boyfriend and wanted to go back to NYC and was written out of the series.

The second season also has Jack McPhee the stranger who came to Capeside and took Joey away from Dawson. Although I have wondered why he was so hot for Joey and then found out he was gay.

We had the return of Joey's long absent father and the subsequent drama. Interaction between Pacey and his father, Divorce, insanity, and much more.

What sets season two apart from the rest of Dawson's Creek is the beautiful romance Kevin Williamson wrote between Pacey and Andie. The ""B"" plot over shadowed the ""A"" plot.

Pacey and Andie one of the best romances ever on TV. To bad the couple was harshly broken up in season three. Also I guess 1.4 million viewers also did not like it also; as that is the number of viewers they lost per episode from season two to season three.",1361664000,2,1087,4.278048780487805
1934967,4,B0000E5NPY,I like this show even more now than when I saw it on TV many years ago.  To see  the actors as teens and then see them as adults is an interesting study.  I have enjoyed every episode thus far.,1360713600,,193,3.775

1934989,5,B0000E5NPY,"While I'm not aware of any high school freshmen/sophomores who have the extensive vocabulaires of the lead characters in this series, and, moreover, who are as articulate, observant, and wise about life, I enjoy it and, in fact, it is largely because of the writing that I like it.  It's unrealistic, but that's OK.  It's very entertaining and thought provoking.  If Pacey had as extensive of vocabulary as on the show, he would have done remarkably well on the vocabulary section of the PSAT.  By the way, when do students now take the PSAT?

There are also incongruities about the apparent size of the community of Capeside and and size of the school and inconsistencies with the actors' personna from time to time.  And, there are lots of issues packed into such a relatively small school, but I understand that the writers have to keep it interesting even if it strains credibility some.  But, it's within the parameters that I'm willing to suspend disbelief.  Of course, I've only seen through the first two seasons and part of the third.",1360454400,,1043,4.787709497206704

1934992,5,B0000E5NPY,Any Dawsons  creek fan would love this set it has every topic u can think of my choices of this season great episodes include is High risk behavior it starts out jack poses nude for Joey for her art project and then it turns to romance and Pacey and Andie have there night of passion and finally Dawson and Jen that one of the best episodes others include the kiss thats the question? and Many others so if any Dawson creek fan what's to own a great season this is the one to get other viewers say the music changed alot yes it did but they didn't change all the songs which is a relief to I miss Dawsons creek alot I am a huge fan and It will never die I will always love the show so much one of the best shows on the WB,1354665600,,721,3.9047619047619047
1934993,3,B0000E5NPY,"One of the things i loved about the first season was the music was appropriate for the time. It brought me back. joshua Jackson totally turned me on to dawsons creek and the reason why i started watching it. what? you mean i actually get to see joshua jackson in several week episodes for how many seasons? I was a fan of the first episode til the end. the last 2 seasons bugged me because it revolved around joey. It says ""dawsons creek"" not ""joeys creek"". I love michelle williams. I loved the third season that micheal pitt is in it. And plays a good guy.
Why oh why would you change the music. in one of the first episodes of this, it is supposed to be ""kiss the rain"". they changed that. the 3rd season they changed the opening credit music to some god aweful music that sounds like someone is dying.
I think the quality is fine. I am not picky. And to not change it would be putting it back in its time. like sex and the city season 1. started the same year, and had the same quality. I liked they didn't change that. but where are all the special features? I had it recorded where they did ""a life in the day of dawsons creek"" it was a whole hour. they interviewed the stars, they showed what they did to goof around etc. I wanted that on here. Im sorry it isn't. But i love the show. a good heartfelt show with no blood or guts in it.",1346457600,,1342,4.106463878326996
1934994,4,B0000E5NPY,"Im almost done with season two (the last episode left) and i can already tell you season two is better than season one, the show relaxes alot (SPOILER ALERT) and its nolonger all about Dawson and Joey. Although i still have a very hard time buying the idea that these two star crossed teens finialy get together at the end of season one, Joey who is clearly head over heals about dawson has some awakening and decides at the age of 16 that if she cant make her whole life about Dawson and dumps him only to hook up with the bus boy 10 seconds later.. Im also a little bothered that the start of the show (or so we all think) Dawson has been dumped twice now.. With that out of the way, the show introduces and we get to know some new characters, and the plot doesnt revolve around Joey and Dawson constantly. Athough the tension is always there and you can just feel at any moment they may get back together. The language and thought process of these 16 year old's is a bit to swallow (again if you can try and think like a 16 year old you will overlook this).. Season two is fun and the main characters all seem to be developing, growing maturing, I think season two is where most of us back in the day got hooked. Im looking forward to covering season three next week and writing my review on it.

Ok update, there were several good twists at the end of season two. the kids of capeside sure don't seem like ""kids"" at this point and the plots getting thicker.. Dawson getting dumped again (this is twice now by Joey) is a real kicker.. but then again the way they just slid back into a relationship together seemed underdeveloped to me. this is a plot downfall and i didn't like it.  We experienced a death just outside the core group and frankly i don't think anybody was real upset that this girl died (besides Jen) and this is expected.  My personal opinion and the best plot turn is Jen moving back in with ""Grams"" and bringing newly homeless Gay Jack with her.. Bible thumping Grandma is going to have a hoot in season 3. Pacey finialy makes a father son connection with his dad and his semi-nut job G/F ""Andi"" leaves capeside for medical attention. So its going to be intresting to see what Pacey Does..

So for a recap:  Im looking forward to breaking the plastic seal on season three this week becouse i want to see in order of importance..

#1 How things develop under Grams roof with Jen & Jack
#2 How Pacey Copes with Andi being gone.
#3 Is Dawsons Mom taking the out of state job? If so is Dawsons dad moving back in to the leery house ?
#4 Dawson and Joey ? where's it going ?

At this point and i hate to admit it as the story is suppose to revolve around Dawson and Joey.. im already bored with there relationship. She's dumped him twice, both times shortly after the relationship started.. at this point i feel pretty bad for Dawson. Lets see where season 3 takes us.",1329782400,,2885,4.272893772893773

1934997,3,B0000E5NPY,"It feels misleading to promote a DVD as a complete collection when certain scenes have been butchered. They couldn't afford the rights to all of the original songs, fine. But there were some songs (the fans will know what I'm talking about!) that it was an absolute disgrace to lose, and they really should have done everything they could to keep them as essential for the scenes. The incredibly poignant parting dance for Pacey/Andie was one of the major moments of the season and one we all remember, but it was ruined by the song replacement. All you end up doing is sitting there and missing the original version, it's not the same at all. They should have at the very least negotiated for the rights to that song and Kiss The Rain for the scene where Dawson and Joey reunite

The special features were disappointing too. Where are the deleted scenes, the gag reel, the featurettes with contributions from the cast? I have seen deleted scenes and gag reels for Dawson's Creek on YouTube, yet not one of them are included on the DVDs. Why not? There really isn't much offered at all, even when DVDs should be seen as an opportunity to offer the loyal fans some new content. Instead it all adds up to feeling like this was a very shoddy and half-hearted release.

And I would have paid extra to at least get what I thought I was buying, a complete version of the episodes and music as originally aired.",1275868800,2,1404,4.5236220472440944

New characters Jack and Andie were good additions to the cast, and brought complications to already established roles.  Jack's budding relationship with Joey, and then coming out in English class.  Andie and Pacey... their mentalities were clashing and a perfect pairing all at the same time.

1935034,4,B0000E5NPY,I loved Dawson's Creek - The Complete Second Season was one of the best seasons that they had made. In  this season the way that they portray  the relationship issues and how it effects everyone that is involved is perfection. When I watched this I stayd attached to  it because it was like I was watching a movie about my life and I was amazed about how that played out.

1935035,3,B0000E5NPY,"... with emotional angst and the unending, uninteresting season-long game of Who Has The Most Problems. The characters spend a lot of time quibbling about how their parents are emotionally detached, or place too much pressure on them, or their parents are too normal and boring, or they don't even have parents. The show begins to comfortably ensconce itself into the structure it strictly abides by in years to come: when things are settling down, someone has to break up with someone over a small problem, and rationalize whatever they've done with enough run-on sentences to send you climbing up the walls.

Equipped with a mighty vocabulary and an even mightier naivete, Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) embarks on the tumultuous quest of his sophomore year of high school, where his much-talked-about relationship with Joey will last a few episodes before the writers decide they aren't giving their characters quite enough to complain about. Hyper-aware to the last iota, Joey (the now infamous Katie Holmes) starts to fill into the central role she will later assume as the series progresses as she dates artsy good-guy Jack, who provides one of the show's most interesting and groundbreaking plot points as he comes out of the closet in a wrencher of a two-parter. In fact, if it weren't for Jack and emotionally strung-out Jen (who this season spends quality time letting her hair down with petite teen villain Abby Morgan), the every-day-is-the-end-of-the-world melodrama and squeamishly sitcom scenarios of season two would fall flat, and fast.

As Dawson deals with his parents' emotional baggage (and no one seems to care), the rest of the characters rigidly pair off to their own individual plotlines. Under the tutelage of perky but problematic Andie, sister of Jack, Pacey starts to come into his own - that is, until her mental health starts to decline. Their father is absent, their mother is a delusional wreck, and they are basically maintaining their household single-handedly. Isn't it convenient that every mildly interesting character has to wag their fingers with a devastating monologue about how hard they have it? And why, oh why, do every one of these characters exhaustively analyze their silly pre-adult pratfalls without actually taking the initiative to avoid them?

This year, DAWSON'S CREEK is dry - not only its humor (Joey catcalls a female instigator ""persnickety"" with a wry smile that suggests she is the only one in the world that knows what's what), but its story arcs - but remains wet with the tears of unhappy and pretentious young adults who will use every opportunity to ruin what is actually going right in their lives. But keep watching - at least it makes you feel better about YOUR petty problems.",1154822400,3,2749,5.024122807017544
1935036,5,B0000E5NPY,"Dawson's Creek - The Complete Second Season is the best of all the seasons. I like the first season and part of the third but the ones that come after that are completely horrible! My fave episode from season two has to be when Jack admits that he is gay, when he reads that poem he wrote in front of his English class, it's hilarious 'cause the poem is about a guy, all of a sudden he is gay? brilliant! Dawson and Joey begin to date and Jen goes back to her old ways (sleeping around) and Pacey has his first real relationship with Jack's mentally disturbed sister, Andie. Andie and Pacey's relationship is so moving and touching, I thought their chemistry was much stronger than when Pacey started having feelings for Joey in the third season. Buy, rent, or borrow this great season, and leave the rest for the suckers who liked season 4, 5, and 6.",1152662400,2,851,4.3924050632911396

I grew up with this show and I was deeply affected by how they would pick out songs with lyrics that matched the scene that was happening.  The music was a strong focus of mine for this show and to change over most of the catalog was entirely disappointing.  I have also read that they do not intend on ever releasing a collection with all the original music due to legal reasons.  So I have no intention of owning this collection again, which is a shame, since I adored this show.  You can still catch re-runs on TV, though, and I would recommend, if sampling this show, to catch the high school episodes as opposed to the college episodes.  The writing is better in the high school episodes and the characters are more enjoyable, especially Pacey, (my favorite).

If you put as much stock in the music of this show as I have, I would not suggest purchasing these DVD sets.",1151539200,7,930,4.4035087719298245

There were a ton of emotional moments, and compelling storylines that kept me wanting to watch until the season was over. We follow Dawson, Joey, Pacey and Jen as they go through high school. Two notable new characters are Andie (Meredith Monroe) and Jack (Kerr Smith). Also Abby played a more prominent role this season. She befriends Jen and they have a tumultuous friendship. The real romance this season came from Pacey and Andie. Their relationship was really touching and beautiful. When Jack came out of the closet, it was riveting and emotional. Dawson and Joey went through a lot of changes. It was a good season filled with laugher, tears, and a variety of other emotions. Great season!",1136592000,,753,4.890625

1935067,4,B0000E5NPY,"We pick up Season 2 of Dawson's Creek, right where Season 1 left off, with Dawson kissing Joey. The Season 2 Premiere is actually one of my favorite episodes of Dawson's Creek. It deals perfectly with first date jitters and the excitement that goes with it. We are also introduced to Andie who charmingly begins her love/hate banter with Pacey. The first episode of Season 2 is definitely up there with the best of Season 1.

Then it goes slightly downhill from there. Not totally. Season 2 is one of the best seasons of Dawson's Creek. It starts to go bad when we begin to sense the impending break-up of Dawson and Joey, which seems a little too contrived to me. In fact it's never really entirely clear why Dawson and Joey break-up which is what leaves me feeling unsettled. Still, we move on through the season nonetheless.

Other plotlines include the evolution of Pacey and Andie's relationship, Andie's brother Jack dating Joey after she breaks up with Dawson and then discovering he is gay, Jen going off the rails, Dawson and Joey getting back together, and Dawson and Joey breaking up again.

Another interesting point, is that throughout Season 1 Dawson was the centre of attention because we as the audience admired Joey's love for him, but since Joey lost interest in Dawson during Season 2, so did some of the audience. I think this continued throughout the rest of the entire series.

All Season 2 episodes are included. It is also the last DVD boxset to feature the original theme song ""I Don't Want To Wait"" sung by Paula Cole. All subsequent DVD boxset releases (The Season Final DVD excluded) feature the alternative theme song sung by Jann Arden. I first saw Dawson's Creek internationally where the Jann Arden song was used only during the first season and I actually preferred it, but it is true that the Jann Arden song sets a slower pace for the show (which worked for Season 1), whereas Paula Cole's song ups the tempo slightly (which works nicely for Season 2). You will also find that some of the other songs have been changed too- this is because of various legal reasons, and was beyond the producers' control, forcing them to pick alternatives. It is a shame that the original songs weren't used in some instances here. Try not to worry too much though because most of the originals are still here.

The show is presented in Full Screen. The only DVD extras are commentaries on the Season Premiere and Season Finale. A little disappointing really, but maybe they're saving them for a future High Definition DVD release.",1124150400,3,2549,4.70627802690583
1935068,4,B0000E5NPY,"The second season of Dawson's Creek has to be the best of the entire series.  What makes season two so superior you may ask?  Not the normal star players but the supporting cast and guest stars are the highlight of the series.  Meredith Monroe, Kerr Smith, Monica Keena, and Jason Behr (from Roswell and The Grudge) make the series intelligent, funny, and noteworthy.  These supporting members and guest stars take stellar writing and make it work more than the faces that we see through the entire series.  These faces make the show interesting and a part of good television.  Even if you aren't a fan of Dawson's Creek, check out these four actors performances in season two.  It will be well worth your while.",1124064000,3,712,4.693548387096774
1935069,5,B0000E5NPY,"~*  First I Just want to say music aside this was an enduring and heart warming season. It remains my top favorite season of Dawsons Creek.

However, yes I was saddened by all the big musical losses namely Tori Amos's ""Northern Lad"", Sophie B Hawkins, ""Lose Your Way"" &  Billie Myers, ""Kiss the Rain"" !! I can't think of another TV show that relied on the music to compliment the mood of the acting ...it was a symbotic relationship that made the CREEK what it is to the fans ! To cut so much ..is very noticable.

All most every single song was altered .. a total count of 93 songs were lost and replaced by seemingly inferior ones!

(...)
""The Season Two DVD set will contain new music not heard during the actual broadcast airings. While Dawson's Creek fans will surely be upset by this, unfortunately this had to be done. Faced with the exorbitant prices of licensing music just for the DVD release, the show decided to replace some of the songs. This allowed Columbia/Tri-Star to release the set at an affordable price for all fans.

Dawson's Creek executive producer Paul Stupin, with collaboration from co-producer Drew Matich, and music supervisor John McCullough, selected the replacement songs""

1935070,5,B0000E5NPY,"Dawsons Creek season two has a few changes, Pacey gets a girlfriend, Dawson hooks up with Joey. Jen changes her hair and dosent hang out with the gang as much, Jack is introduced, and Dawsons parents get divorced. So yeah. this has 22 episodes which is a little under half more than season one. And nearly every episode is great!

What I like most about ""Dawson's"" is that it totally deals with true problems of teens and stuff like Divorce, illness', love, friendship, death, and sexuality. It is just a really true show.

If you want some good viewing get this and just watch it. Most people could probably relate to it.

As for the special features, I haven't got this edition, I have an Australian edition and well, it has NO special features, I know it sucks, well it has like 2 commentaries, WOW! This one I think has an interactive tour, which would be pretty cool.

This may not be as classic as season one, but personally I think its better!

  Finally Joey and Dawson kiss, and it seems so perfect. But they soon realize how being a couple can change things. Also, Pacey finds a new love interest, Andy, who helps Pacey find himself and shows him his potential. The on and off relationship with Dawson and Joey will keep your eyes glued to the screen. It also deals with Andy's brother Jack, as he admits openly to being gay and how his family and classmates treat him for it.

What is wrong with you WB?  Have you no respect for the fans of the show? No pride in what you put on the shelves?  These sets are intended as keepsakes for people to remember the show.
The picture quality is almost as bad as the first season, but the real thing which is going to make me return this dvd is the replaced music.  What WB or whoever made the changes obviously does not understand is that the music was a very very important part of the show, and scenes and episodes are connected to certain songs for all the fans.  Well not with this DVD.
Why can't Dawsons Creek get the same respect and treatment on DVD that shows like Buffy, or Smallville, or countless other shows get on DVD? Raise the price $10 or $20 - fans will pay it if you make it worthwhile - which its currently is not.

In order to serve the greater good, the intelligent producers of Dawson's Creek chose not to hold on to the license's and use new songs, which may not be as touching/nostalgic as the original songs, but have allowed the lesser fortunate to own their favorite show on DVD.

However, for those who just like the show for its content and storylines the DVD will live up to your expectations.
And whilst i think i can say for a lot of people Andie was the least favourite character of the 2nd season i think it is rude that she does not merit a spot in the line up of regular characters.  The blurb on the back mentions 5 friends and Andie's name is not even written(although i suppose there is a picture.)  She played a heavy role in the 2nd season (Pacey's girlfriend etc) and although the mentally unstable storyline became tedious after a while those brave enough to admit it could still not tear themselves away from the show even for 1 episode.

On second season, we are introduced to Jack and Andie McPhee, we see Dawson and Joey together, in classical moments, and we watch Jen become more mature and reveal the black sheep side of her.
I think that second season represents a relevant step to Dawson's Creek. By this time, the show starts to deal with serious issues, such as Jack's sexuality and Andie's illness. Also, Abby Morgan leaves the show, in a tragic accident. We can't forget the classic kiss of Joey and Dawson in the rain (""Crossroads"" episode), as well as Dawson and Andie performance during a regretable 16th birthday (""Be careful what you wish for"" episode). The second season finale (""Parental Discretion Advised"" episode) is great and very touching.

 - DISCO 2: seis episodios, lo que hace que el bitrate del video sea de menor calidad considerando que un DVD regular a una calidad aceptable solo tiene capacidad para 4 episodios.

It is just a great warm show.  1/2 of the reason I find it so enjoyaable is the music.  THe songs were curent with the time and still remind me of a few years back.  I vividly remember sitting and watching hte music fit perfectly with the show.  It was amazing. The DVD (due to legal reasons) shnged the music leaving a huge void.  The show is sub-par without the original music.  The pvital moments and music are now missing, making me not likely to watch the remainder.",1075161600,2,625,4.327586206896552
1935140,5,B0000E5NPY,"First off, Dawon's Creek is absolutely an amazing show.  It mirrors so close to teens that its a little freaky.  Everyone and I mean everyone can relate to at least one of the characters.  If you buy one tv show series on dvd, make it Dawson's Creek season two because it is simply the best.  It is so emotionally moving, you find yourself thinking about each and every episode days after you watched it, not many shows have the power to do that.",1074211200,,446,4.337349397590361

I'm not real sure what the big deal is with the music change, there are songs that I liked from the original, however I found that the new music gave the DVD a fresh new sound.  If the music is the only thing that people have a complaint too in this DVD set, then it tells me that the Producers of this show definitely did something right.  For those people that cant seem to get over the musical change all 6 seasons are being aired on WTBS, buy a DVD recorder and record them yourself.

1935172,3,B0000E5NPY,"I'm all for a five star rating of this set- having the second season all laid out on DVD, no rewinding or fast-forwarding to get to favorite scenes... it sounded perfect.  That is, until I flicked straight to one of my all-time, bookmark-it-now scenes in the second episode and found that the song was completely different and nowhere near as good.
For a show that based so much of the emotional impact in the music and had such great songs for key scenes, I find it crazy that they have been changed.  Cost cutting, rights wrangling, explain it how you will, I just felt like I was watching a cheap, ""lite"" version of the show that I loved and it has definitely suffered for it.  Think of the patented Joey Potter roll-of-the-eyes when you see this modification listed in the ""Features"".

I love the season one DVD, althought I was disappointed with the exclusion of an extras, except for two commentaries. I feel the same way about the season two DVD. With all the publicity DC got, seems like there should be more extras. I was also disturbed that the majority of the music has been changed. I could understand some changes, but some songs in key moments of the show where changed (like Heather Nova's beautiful song PAPERCUP & Billie Myers KISS THE RAIN) Some changes where even made to the songs that came right from the Dawson's Creek Sountrack CD.  I know that the producers chose to change the songs to try to keep the price point of the DVD as low as possible, but since fans are the ones buying the DVD, seems like they should've included the original content of the show, even if it was going to cost a little more. Die hard fans will surely be a little disappointed by it, but it is nice to have the entire season on DVD. Being from NC (where DC was filmed) I really enjoy remembering the characters and how life was during the time the show aired.  I plan on buying more DC DVDs, but I just hope that not too many changes will be made to future releases.",1074038400,,1238,4.286324786324786

No more ""Kiss the Rain"" by Billie Myers or ""Save  Tonight"" by Eagle Eye Cherry, ""She's So High"" by Tal Bachman, or ""Shimmer"" by Shawn Mullins, among MANY others.  It's terrible.

Please note that while you still hear ""Who Needs Sleep"" by the Barenaked Ladies during the last scene of the ""All Nighter"" episode, you no longer hear ""Smoke"" by Natalie Imbruglia during the ""To Be Or Not To Be"" episode where Pacey explains himself to Andie on the docks, nor will you hear ""Freak of the Week"" by the Marvelous 3 as the recently outed Jack arrives for Dawson's surprise birthday party during the ""Be Careful What You Wish For"" episode.  Hopefully in upcoming seasons, executive producers will leave what's best alone.  Paul Stupin's commentary does get a little silly at times too, but if you're a fan, you'll love the set.",1073001600,3,812,4.618055555555555
1935179,5,B0000E5NPY,"The pivotal episode in the second season of ""Dawson's Creek"" is, ironically enough, the second episode, ""Crossroads.""  That is the one where Dawson and Joey are so caught up in their budding romance that they forget about Pacey's birthday while Jen begins a strange friendship with Abby.  Certainly the theme of the second season was the idea of transitions as Dawson and Joey have trouble enjoying finally being together (""The Kiss"") before their romance explodes (""The Dance""), Pacey hooks up with smart girl Andie (""Full Moon Rising"") and her complicated family (""The Reluctant Hero""), Jack comes to the realization he is gay (""To Be or Not To Be..."" and ""That is the Question""), and Jen's reckless lifestyle leads to a tragic climax (""A Perfect Wedding"").
Pacey clearly becomes the central figure in the Capeside crew during season two, mainly because he keeps sticking up for others, such as Jack when he reads his infamous poem in class and Andie when her father wants her to leave Capeside, and even himself, in a fateful confrontation with his father.  Dawson is too busy playing the part of Hamlet, almost always too immobilized by over thinking his life's problems to actually do anything about them.  Of course, when he finally does act, and forces Joey to confront the fact that her father is getting involved with trafficking drugs again, it ends up being the apparent death blow to their friendship (""Parental Discretion Advised"").
I should point out that I have a somewhat warped perspective on this series because I started watching it when the gang graduated from high school.  I just happened to catch that episode and the following fall I started watching the series because my students wanted to watch it for the television unit of my Popular Culture class.  Consequently I know that Dawson made it out of high school with his virginity intact, which means that when I watch all of his sexual angst in the first four seasons of the series I know that rooting for the boy is not going to do any good.  So of course I end up rooting for Pacey.  Nobility is always much more impressive when it is a surprise.  I wanted to root for Jack, but as much as the show deserves credit for having a gay teenage character, ""Dawson's Creek"" really did not know what to do with him and I shudder to think what sort of mixed messages this gave to the thousands of teenagers who were trying to relate to the character and his situation (what Jack needed was a really good gay friend, where their friendship confused all of the stereotypical presumptions about gay people).
Ultimately having the show become about Pacey and Andie rather than Dawson and Joey rings false, because ""Dawson's Creek"" is at its best when those two are on the front burner.  As long as it is the last day of the year and I am in the mood to think great thoughts, I will throw out the idea that for this generation of television viewers the Dawson-Joey-Pacey triangle is their version of the Arthur-Guenivere-Lancelot story.  That over inflated idea would justify the ways things worked out in the end as much as anything else.  Now if somebody could just explain why Joey has so few tops that reach down below the top of her jeans that would be one less thing to worry about next year.",1072828800,9,3264,4.687062937062937

1935212,3,B0000E5NPY,"My anticipation for this release was so great that I didn't pay attention at first to the comments online re the music changes.  I read them belatedly, yet still hoped against hope that they would be minor.  They are not.
First of all, I am appalled that these changes are not more prominently noted on the packaging for the collection.  Would most people know that ""features brand new music selected by the executive producer"" in small type on the back of the box means that this is not additional music but is a full replacement of 75-90% of the original songs?
Second, this is a show that pioneered big pop soundtracks on TV.  Working in the industry, I remember one of my first reactions to the show was that the budget on music clearances must be enormous--well, this is where the producers finally let the fans down.  After two soundtrack CD's and a TV special promoting the music used in DAWSON'S CREEK--not to mention the afore-mentioned exec producer bragging about his selections on DVD commentaries--we lose far too many of these same songs in this new collection.
So many fans have noted their missing favorites and I agree with them all.  For me, one of the most devastating loses is Natalie Merchant's ""Frozen Charlotte"", which plays under the scene after Dawson's disastrous 16th birthday party when Joey goes to the window and makes a wish on the first snowfall.  It's a moment filled with magic as well as melancholy and the song adds to its poignancy and power.  Hearing the song for the first time made me want to investigate the other music used in the shows.  The new song is sweet enough but pales in every comparison.
To say I was disappointed is a gross understatement.  I can tell you this: I was considering buying a second copy as a Christmas present for my niece (who is following my interest in the show).  Forget about it.  I'll give her my tapes instead.  I want her to see the show as it was originally intended.
To Sony & company: Please continue to release THE CREEK on DVD--but don't tamper with the shows!  You probably lost sales on this one trying to save money on clearances, and I'm sure I'm not the only fan who would have gladly paid the extra $$$ to get the show they love instead of this hybrid.",1072483200,9,2239,4.551122194513716

When I saw an article about the release of Season 2, I was quickly mad at the fact that they changed the soundtrack to this season. Not everything was changed, but lots of it. And I know this it due to money and copyright issues. I remember saying to myself: ""If they get rid of 'Kiss the Rain' or 'Save Tonight,' I'm going to get really mad."" Well, here you go...
Those of you that are familiar with the episodes of Dawson's Creek. Remember the episode 'Crossroads'? This is the one where Dawson and Joey have their first fight. When they make up they walk up to each other in the rain and Billie Myers' 'Kiss the Rain' is playing. The fact is that you hear a completely new song. A new song!!!! I don't even know the song. 'Kiss the Rain' was the perfect song to play at that moment. Again at the end when Dawson and Pacey come to an understand and decide to take that trip to Maine, you expect to hear 'Save Tonight'. NO! This is all in one episode. Those songs made this episode one of the best. I am really disappointed by the fact that these songs aren't there. This makes me not want to watch the DVDs anymore and stay with the TBS original showing episodes.",1071878400,10,1342,4.165384615384616
1935215,4,B0000E5NPY,"Out of all 6 seasons, I'm sure most would agree Season 2 remains the strongest, and the season most teenagers could relate to. Tons of issues arise, such as friendships falling apart, divorce, coming out, falling in and out love etc. etc. Each character is given their own storyline this season and each one is just as intriquing as the others. In this season, Dawson adn Joey get together only to break up once Joey falls for the new guy in town Jack. Pacey meets and falls in love with the highstrung, overachieving Andie McPhee, and Jenn starts going back to her wild days in New York, drinking, partying, and having sex. Theres only a few duds in the season, but we get some excellent episodes such as The Election, in which Joey and Andie run for class presidents in which the whole school learns the truth about Andie and Jacks mother, It involves a touching scene between Pacey and the mother in a grocery store, which I'm convinced is the reason so many fell in love with Pacey instead od Dawson. The heartbreaking 2 parter of Jacks coming out, in which Kerr Smith gives an emotional and intense performance as he deals with coming out of the closet to his family and friends. Katie Holmes remains the center of the show in my opinion, always giving a sincere and honest look at a real teenager. James Van Der Beek goes a little over the top at times, but Joshua Jackson as Pacey steals every scene he is in. Always charming and likeable, and the underdog you always root for in the end. Michelle Williams is always very subtle in her performances and can handle drama and comedy and handles both very well. The only problem I have with Season 2 is Monica Keena becoming a major recurring character as Abby. She is one of the worst actresses on television, and I can't understand why she was chosen let alone kept for the entire season. However, we do say goodbye to Abby after this season. Last but not least, I love the character of Andie, Paceys girlfriend, and thought that her storylines were well written and  intriquing. However, Meredith Monroe, gets runner up for the worst actress working in television. The girl does not understand the word subtlety, and after awhile, I wanted to skip her scenese because I could not bare to watch her over the top performances. Dawsons Creek went downhill after Season 2 so it's nice to be able to go back and watch the season that made this show one of the best teen dramas on television.",1071792000,3,2443,4.5396825396825395

What I can say about Dawsons Creek is that, it gives out good pointer's to Teenagers,and others in their mid 20's who can relate to the show. Once you get attached to the show, you Kind of put your own life into it. The show just make's you THINK. Of what you can do to prevent problem's in your life that could happen, and it also just bring's you UP in the world when thing's alway's seem to go down, with the advice the friends give to eachother on different episodes. Dawsons Creek, SHOCKS you ! There is something NEW every day when the show was on. That's why I NEVER got bored watching it. When it was Wednesday night, no one was supposed to call me, or bug me between 8 pm and 9 pm till MY SHOW was done ! I have to admit, I am 25 years old now and I miss it. It was something I enjoyed during the week was watching DAWSONS CREEK. I am relieved that they have the DVD's out now, so I can look back on all the episodes I have loved through out the years!

1935218,5,B0000E5NPY,"I have been a huge fan of this show since the pilot aired and I have not missed an episode! Even through all the couple wars (Pacey and Joey ROCK!), I find that I just love everything about this show, no matter what couple is together, what couple isn't together, who's friends, who's not. It's just that good.
This is such a great season, with Andie and Pacey falling in love and seeing how Jen and Jack's great friendship begins. I wish Joey and Pacey had a big more interaction this season, but I still like their storylines.
The one thing that kind of upsets me is the music situation. I have found many great artists through this show and am saddened that most of the original songs will be absent from the DVDs. I am definitely one of those fans who hear a song that was in the original airings and immediately relate it back to ""Dawson's Creek"" and what was going on when it was playing. I, along with many others, have come to love the music with the show and relate the songs back to our favorite moments, characters and couples. It's going to be sad that they won't be used anymore. But, since I am such a huge fan of music and have found a lot of great bands and musicians through this show, I'm also excited for the prospect of finding brand new songs and artists through the new songs choosen for the season 2 DVDs.
I'm very excited for season 2 to come out on DVD and I'm even more excited to have seasons 3 & 4 follow! Please please please send them our way soon! We'll snatch them up!",1070841600,2,1500,4.248251748251748
1935219,5,B0000E5NPY,"Dear Amazonians,
I was introduced to the Dawson's Creek clan later on in the series.  I had not watched it all the way from the beginning.
I must say that what struck me the most by watching this television series is the honest and straightforward presentation of teen life, and how a group of friends gets along through all kinds of diverse relationships.  This show is among precious few that incorporated homosexuality into the relationships among its characters at the time of its initial airing  Today, however, there are more such shows, thanks to Dawson's Creek, and the sitcom ""Will and Grace.""  This kind of show is especially important today, as there are some in our society who do not fully understand what gay people are about, and how very much like everyone else they are.  The issues that the gay community relates to are mostly about being accepted by the other members of society.  Otherwise, the gay community is just like any other kind of community.
The fictional town of Capeside, Massachusetts is very small, and undiverse.  There are virtually no African-Americans or gay people there (although some people there may be gay, they are not ""out"").  Jack McPhee, a gay man who eventually comes out to his conservative and abusive father is a big inspiration to his friends and schoolmates in Capeside.  Eventually, his peers embrace him as a full-fledged member of their ""group.""
To me, this is a very progressive show that really shows that all relationships are about love and acceptance, no matter who is involved.  I highly recommend this series to all who are interested in a real and honest look at the lives of young people, and how they grow into each other in a veery nice way.
Take care,

1935220,3,B0000E5NPY,"People never give teen dramas the respect they deserve. They often consider them trashy and melodramatic. I blame shows like ""90210"" and ""The OC"" for this.
Dawson's Creek may have been a ""teen drama"" but it was very real for the most part. The actors (unlike the 90210 ""actors"")  weren't pretty high school students that looked like twenty-eight year old models and they weren't bombarded with the ludicrous OC type of ""everyday teen plots"" that would never happen to any real teen. Dawson and his friends (with the exception of Pacey) went through the same things we all went through in high school. I've never seen actual realism in a teen drama before I saw Dawson's Creek for the first time. Critics seem to think that It's a teen ""soap-opera"" with pretty people that are phonies. I think they must have been in home-school when they were in high school if they truly believe this.
The second season of Dawson's Creek is worth your money if you like great drama with a good sense of realism. It really sets up a powerful and excellent third season that really portrays real teen love in a nice way.",1069113600,,1102,4.622448979591836

1935253,5,B0000E5NPY,"I'm a massive Dawson's Creek fan, always will be. If you ask me, season two is right up there on the top seasons list. Not only is this the season that everything begins to spark up but we see a lot of action happening on the creek as it's the season right after the first and everythings just starting to stir up. Season two is definitely one of my favourites because of its high entertainment. ""Roswell High"" star Jason Behr gest stars in a few episodes this season as Chris Wolf who becomes Jen Lindley's new love interest. Also you will see guest appearances by Rachael Leigh Cook as the naked model Devon, Scott Wolf as Clifford Elliot. This season is also the peak of Capeside's bitchiest character,Abby Morgan played by ""Crime & Punishment in Surberbia"" star Monica Keena.(I think that was the same of her film). The season also welcomes the new brother/sister duo, Jack & Andie Mc Phee. Believe me this season has so much going on that it's a MUST have!! Seriously, you must purchase this.
 So what are the highlights of this season? Well without giving away too much detail, we witness:
* A tragic death.
* Someone comes out of the closet.
* Pacey finds himself a girlfriend.
* ""That"" certain teacher returns.
* Jen Lindley switches back to her New York ways.
* Divorce.
* Something happens to the Ice House.
* Dawson Leery directs his ""Creek Daze"" movie.
* The ups and downs of Joey Potter & Dawson Leery's relationship.
...So there you have some wonderful times on the creek. Overall, season two is a great season if you like lots of action and wanna begin to see those high school students grow up in the fictional sleepy town of Capeside!

As I was recovering, TBS started to aire the whole show before the big end. At first I didn't think much of it, then i watched the first four episodes and let's just say that 8:00 a.m.(that's the time it started) i was up and waiting. These are kids much like me who are facing lifes many challenges. Bad things happen and there's not always a happy ending, much like real life. Pacey, Joey, Dawson(of course), and Jen are now like a second family to me. It made me stop worring about my problems and think about others. Joey Potter though is truly my life changing idol. Her emotions are overwhelming and heart warming all at the same time. Katie Holmes truly connected with her, there is so much passion.

Pacey and Joey belong together though, and that is why the series finale was so great.",1066867200,5,319,4.56140350877193
1935257,4,B0000E5NPY,"DC is definitely my favorite show of all time and S2 is certainly worth buying on DVD!
Though I wouldn't consider it the best season as some above have, I think the strength of it is that it moves away from the Joey/Dawson/Jen love triangle and introduces some great new characters in Andie and Jack McPhee. Also, Pacey moves out of the shadows as Dawson's sidekick and becomes an amazingly complex character for a teen soap. He and Andie's relationship is intense and moving, as is episode #212 ""Unchartered Waters"" which shows his very dysfunctional relationship with his father.
Dawson and Joey are sweet as a couple, but of course they break up and parts of the middle of the season when Dawson is filming the movie of their relationship their pondering and endless conversations about their relationship really start to wear. They become sweet again, however, when they finally get back together. But of course they break up again- anyone sensing a theme here?
Jen is pretty much out of control and this is probably her worst season-she even gets stuck with a bible thumping homophobic boyfriend. However, the seeds of her fantastic relationship with Jack are sown and that is one of the best parts of this show moving forward. His coming out is also quite moving.
Great set up to Season 3 which is, in my opionion, the best season of all!",1066867200,8,1344,4.723404255319149
1935258,5,B0000E5NPY,"Every loyal DC fan should buy S2. This season, along with Season One, are the ONLY seasons worth buying. The show went completely downhill after that, which was evident by that non-sensical, horrid mess that was the series finale. So buy this season, and you will see that the show used to have heart. It wasn't always a trashy 90210 wannabe. The characters used to be intelligent, funny, and all around interesting people. And the writers weren't changing the characters to fit whatever plot they wanted to do that week. It used to have depth to it. So, if you get this DVD, you won't be disappointed. This DVD is from when the show used to be good.",1066435200,,650,4.516949152542373
1935259,5,B0000E5NPY,But I would love to have them all. I am very sad that Dawsons creek is over. I started watching it when it came out my senior year of high school and never missed a show! Please do all the seasons on DVD!,1066348800,,204,3.7674418604651163

HOWEVER, I AM ECSTATIC TO LEARN THAT IS NOT THE CASE. While I have all of season 2 recorded on vhs I will definitely be purchasing the DVD. I just hope it doesn't take this long for season 3 & 4 & 5 and well the whole damn show to come out on DVD because I will definitely be one of the first people in line to get my copy. I LOVE Dawson's Creek & can't wait to relive all the great moments again and again. Especially Joey & Pacey  moments so HURRY and release that season!!!",1066176000,8,616,4.008130081300813
1935271,5,B0000E5NPY,This DVD will be under my Christmas tree from myself hehe.  Undoubtedly the best season ever.  So much happens and so many surprises!  I didn't know they let Kevin Williamson go after this season and it definitely shows in the later seasons but still one of my favorite shows.  Bringing back past characters and bringing in new ones was an excellent idea and done very well.  The last episode is a shocker I thought and will leave you begging for season 3 to come out.,1066176000,,468,4.458823529411765
1935272,5,B0000E5NPY,Season 2 is the most important.  It is when Jack and Andie arrive on the scene.  It also finally lets Dawson and Joey hook up as boyfriend/girlfriend.  I feel that it sets the tone for the final four seasons.  Please put all Dawson's Creek episodes onto DVD.,1066176000,2,258,4.425531914893617
1935273,5,B0000E5NPY,yes yes and more yes the BEST season of Dawsons Creek ever the impact it had on me don't get me started! Jack and Andie move to capeside Jen makes Friends with Abby and yes Roswells main star Jason Behr makes many apperances! If you thought Season One would be the best season of them all think again. This is by far the best season of Dawsons Creek ever! This is a must have for every Dawsons Creek fan and basically every dvd collecter and whats great is its out just before christmas meaning its a great christmas idea!,1066176000,,522,4.282828282828283
1935274,5,B0000E5NPY,"I've seen all the episodes and there will be no suspense in watching this particular DVD, but that doesn't mean I can wait for it to come out!  I have the other two DVD sets (the finale which I just purchased last weeekend and have watched every evening since) and I would highly support the idea of the rest of the seasons being released...the last half of season three is a favorite.  In the meantime, ""I don't wanna wait"" for season two.",1066003200,,440,4.353658536585366
1935275,5,B0000E5NPY,"Dawson's Creek TV series is just magnificent. It has the unique power to take you back to your teenage years. It's beautiful, it's heartfelt, thrilling, funny, it brings up feelings you've never experienced before.
I just love this series and every single character in it. Season 2 is wonderful as well. It's great to follow the stories and insecurities of its characters towards their growth and maturity.
We, DC fans deserve the gift of having all 6 seasons at home.
And you can't miss any one of them.",1065916800,2,504,4.738636363636363
1935276,5,B0000E5NPY,"The episodes is season two are incredible. Dawson and Joey fist starting to date...ah! Even though it ended differently than I anticipated and hoped, I still LOVE this show! They'd be smart to release  all 6 seasons on DVD because I WILL BUY THEM and I know others would as well. I highly recommend this DVD set!",1065830400,,312,4.473684210526316
1935277,5,B0000E5NPY,Dawson's creek is by far one of the best shows to ever be on tv.  All DC fans would want to buy this.  The second season was the the ultimate season.  This is definetely the best DC season.  I have watched the show since the first season.  I have watched every season and the second is by far the best.  I have been waiting for this dvd for the longest time.  This episodes are amazing and filled with action.  I encourage every DC fan to get this.  Keep the DC season dvds coming!,1065830400,,481,4.086021505376344
1935278,5,B0000E5NPY,"DO NOT READ IF NOT HAVE SEEN SEASON!!!!
Well here it finally is, the complete Second season of Dawson's Creek.  This is agruablly the best season the show had.  I remember when it was when, for me atleast, Dawson went from an ""oh well i missed an episode"" to a ... I MISSED ANY EPISODE (followed by a kick to a book).  After this season the show lost its executive producer and creator Kevin Williamson, and his leaving can definatly be felt in the later seasons, but im getting ahead of myself.  The second season starts right where the first season left of (to the second) and continues to tell the story of the gangs freshman year of Highschool.
The Second season is basically a continuation of the first season with one major difference... the addition of two characters.  One character is Andie McPhee and pretty-blonde who hates Pacey, so they naturally become an item.  And the other character is Jack McPhee Andies brother, who after a few month becomes Jen's best friend.  These characters has a diffent effect on the show, and Jack stays for the remander of the series, while Andie sticks around for a few years.
This is a teen soap, so it would be pretty hard to explain the story-line of an entire season but I will try... Dawson and Joey go out until Joey realizes that she wants to find herself, and breaks up with DAwson, but then starts to go out with Jack until he realizes he is Gay, then joey floots until she wants to get back together with DAwson but won't because he helped put her father back in Jail.  Pacey meets a girl, that he falls inlove with, but who has problems nobody could foresee.  Jen becomes an drunk outcast that only sobbers up when her friend Abby is killed.  And Dawson just floats as usually, trying to figure out what to do about his parents.
The Second Season Episodes are The Kiss, Crossroads, Alternate Lifestyles, Tamara's Return, Full Moon Rising (my personal season favorite), The Dance, the All-nighter, The Relucant Hero, The Election, High Risk Behavor (Argueably the best episode of the series), Sex She Wrote, Uncharted Waters, His Leading Lady, To Be or not to Be (1), ...That is the Question (2) (Changed television history), Be Carefull what you wish for, Psychic Friends, A Perfect Wedding, Reunited, Ch... Ch.... Changes, Parental Discretion Advised.
The Special Featurs for the season include Audio Commentaries (Can't figure out which episodes yet email me if you do (moviemancritter@yahoo.com)), Featurette, Interactive Map of Capeside, Music Video, and DVD-Rom.
So Sit back and remember what it was like to be 15 and have the vocabulary of a 35 year old english professor.",1065744000,19,2635,4.746170678336981
