8224851,3,B000WPGJAI,"Caution: plot details follow! You are in a German POW camp.  You are supposed to be focused on escaping and so they are herein....until the Germans get wind of this and ask to join in the escape! When the German Kommandant suggests this and further suggests that the prisoners' tunnels are not needed and he can simply open the gates for everyone the British commander rails at him: ""Walk out of the gate? Walk out of the gate? Men have sweated their guts out! We've dug tunnels. We've made air pumps. We've laid railway tracks. We've made trollies. It's like the London underground down there. Men have risked their lives! This is a classy operation. And we are not simply going to abandon it and walk out of the gate! There is a right way and a wrong way of doing things. If you were British, you would realize that.""

So the tunnel idea is kept, but whence the Germans go through it first there's a mutiny and the POWs ask now that the guards are gone why ""escape"" at all. So they stay, but now there are now Germans in uniform to give the semblance of a functioning POW camp and without that they can't accept scheduled food deliveries and the like. So a selection of the prisoners switch sides, so to speak, and put on German uniforms. But then an inspection tteam comes and castigates them for running a camp where the prisoners are living too good. So they have to play it tougher on their own guys. This results in some of the prisoners escaping from their own colleagues and when the camp is ""liberated"" they refuse to acknowledge that the ""kommandant"" is really one of their own.  It's a rather depressing ending for a film that purports to be a comedy.",1389657600,,1663,4.445901639344262

8224854,2,B000WPGJAI,"Here we have a top-rate cast that should've been a first-rate comedy but has a leaden script and no direction whatsoever. As it is, the movie just limps along.",1357948800,,159,4.517241379310345

8224856,3,B000WPGJAI,"This had such potential with a top cast and great plot, but the script seemed to let it down. It just didn't seem to flow and instead of laughing alot I only smiled a bit. Could have been done better.",1252281600,8,200,4.025
