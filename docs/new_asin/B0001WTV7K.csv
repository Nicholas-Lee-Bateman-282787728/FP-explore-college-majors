2036757,5,B0001WTV7K,"This thirty-year-old film is ok. It is gripping, and has lots of drama, but it is missing something modern dramas have, one can feel that it is ever-so-slightly off, and as a result, although we are drawn into the drama, it seems not as exciting as it could be. Members of a German gang kidnap the crew of a flight that arrives in Germany and demands the release of two men that the US government wants to try in the US. One of the crew is the daughter of a football coach who was in the army three decades ago, but only was involved in football in the army. The coach is very self-willed, unable to listen to others when he should listen except in rare cases when his wife begs him to listen, but while she begs him not to get involved in the rescue of their daughter he refuses to listen and joins with a man who tells him he is a professional rescuer. This causes enormous stress between husband and wife.
The gang leader kills one of the crew to show he is serious. The rescuer kidnaps the gang leaders brother in the hope that this will persuade him to release the hostages. The CIA is involved and lies to the couple. The German police and government off the couple no help. A reporter is involved, but he is interested in a good story so that he can improve his job. The husband does things he would not do if his daughter was not kidnaped.",1468886400,,1347,4.224806201550388
