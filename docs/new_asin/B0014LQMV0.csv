8256019,4,B0014LQMV0,I thought it was pretty good. I would recommend it for a personal collection.,1476316800,,77,4.571428571428571
8256020,4,B0014LQMV0,"Okay so this hentai was made in 2001, so the graphics are not going to be that great. The story is nice, but it is a little long, the running time is a hour and twenty minutes. It's about one guy that meets three different girls, so the dvd consists of three different stories. Overall on a scale of 1 to I give this hentai a 5.",1461369600,,328,3.91044776119403
8256021,4,B0014LQMV0,relatively good if a little short given the storyline.,1453420800,,54,5.111111111111111
8256022,5,B0014LQMV0,"This is one of the few exceptions of pornography that also focus on the relations between people where men do not torture women on purpose, other than the unavoidable cheating in these genre.  Furthermore, whats really unique from this series is having a central male (Masato) figure willing to forgive and understand his cheating partner. In all other porn series its always men who get sex with multiple partners.

Of course, you shouldnt expect too much boldness from Masato's cheating partner, who actually didn't cheat on him at the end, but she surely did seem like it. That was the Masatos merit, to look over it not only after seeing his own fault but also acknowledging that things don't have to be what they seem.

Yes, I really liked Masatos profile, a rather average guy like in many hentai series (and maybe most anime for male market). However Masato was nice for real. Unlike most other fake nice guys in several anime series Masato didn't spent his time either yelling at the poor women crazy for them or being yelled at by other women, like Rito in ToLove-Ru. Masato and his friend never ever despised women for their sexual craving.

Meanwhile, women in this series maintained a high dose of emotional independence; most of them just continued with their lives after enjoying themselves, not only sexually but also emotionally. In fact, women here controlled the story, not only at their benefit but also at their partner's. This story is more an utopia than a porn show, something that should exist in reality.

Im afraid this series will eventually get forgotten and lost, which is unfortunate given the positive outlook that it stands for.",1433116800,2,1660,4.851590106007067
8256023,5,B0014LQMV0,This could be the real thing. It's show how things can get mixed up in a relationship. And with different seasons. How can someone screw it up so badly in life. A fine work of anime.,1425945600,,182,4.083333333333333
