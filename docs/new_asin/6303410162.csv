This begins as a good story but settles into the usual comedy. The use of commercial rivalry is a new twist in this series. Traveling to Hawaii adds an advantage over the past stories, but little of the scenery is shown. A credit check on Pa would have revealed the truth, why wasn't it done?",1504656000,,2033,4.2727272727272725
