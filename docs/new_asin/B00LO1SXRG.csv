8667033,5,B00LO1SXRG,"Anyone who likes true story TV movies, or Lifetime movies, will love this incredible, heart-breaking story that spans over 25 years.

The story starts in 1962 when a single mom (Marg Helbenberger) is arrested and imprisoned for merely accepting a ride. When she is released from prison, she is horrified to discover that while she was gone, her trusted friend had her children put into foster care, and now it is impossible to find her kids.

As the years go by, Marg remarries to an abusive drunk (Chris Noth) and she has another child. But Marg's suffering isn't done yet, as she must endure more tragic events with with her new family. (I won't spoil it.)

Like I said, anyone who enjoys these types of true-story TV movies about women who must endure and overcome incredible obstacles, will absolutely LOVE this sensational TV movie.",1410825600,2,837,4.798611111111111
