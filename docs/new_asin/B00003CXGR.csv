1265501,4,B00003CXGR,"Small Time Crooks is not only for Woody Allen admirers! It's not only one of the funniest films Allen has ever made, it's also the best film he's made in years!
It's pure comedy. With Allen Himself playing an unusually un-intellectual part, superbly supported by a.o. Tracy Ullman as his wife.
Somehow, Allen manages to make film joke klichs funnier than ever. He turns slapstick-like gags into scenes that are actually funny instead of dumb. And this without exaggerating his ever-present philosophical connotations.
So Small Time Crooks is not only for Woody Allen admirers!",976060800,,576,5.138297872340425

1265655,4,B00003CXGR,"It's a sweet, sometimes laugh out loud bit of nonsense that will certainly keep you smiling. Elaine May however, is surprisingly lacklustre, and her dialogue at times is extremely lame, but a brilliant performance from Tracy Ullman and a terrific one from Hugh Grant, give it a real kick. It's great fun. The sequence where Woody attempts to steal a necklace is wonderful. Guarenteed to cheer you up.",1424563200,,400,4.897058823529412
1265656,5,B00003CXGR,"On the surface this would appear to be one of Woody Allen's lighter offerings but if you dig deeper he's trying to convey a message to his intended audience.  Consider if you will when Allen began making films they were more commercially oriented but he felt straightjacketed by them.  He graduated from those early efforts to make more ambitious fare like ""Interiors"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" but his audience narrowed in the process.  Allen began appealing to the more affluent intellectual crowd but in the process sacrificed his appeal to the broader masses.  With this film Allen is saying that on some level he's still the kid from Brooklyn who likes baseball and cheeseburgers who happens to make funny and smart films.  That said this is a smart and funny film.  I love the Ralph and Alice Kramden byplay between Allen and Tracey Ullman.  The dcor of their apartment after they strike it rich is worth the price of admission alone.  The real surprise is Elaine May who plays Ullman's not as ditsy as she would appear to be aunt.  May's screen appearances are scarce and I would strongly urge you to seek out her wonderful film ""A New Leaf"" with Walter Matthau.  This film caught me completely by surprise and I would rank it as one of Allen's better comedies.",1422316800,,1272,4.714932126696833

1265775,4,B00003CXGR,"""Small Time Crooks"" is one of Woody Allen's minor masterpieces. The performances of Tracey Ullman and Elaine May are gems. Yet the DVD is rare and hard to find.

He must have done something right because the demand for the DVD has driven the cost up to 4 times more than his top movies like ""Annie Hall"". I was happen to pay the price to add it to my Allen collection.",1353974400,,368,4.183098591549296
1265776,5,B00003CXGR,"This is one of my favorite Woody Allen films.  It's one of his heist movies which ordinarily doesn't interest me as much as his human nature relationship films.  This one was so well done, entertaining and funny that I never get tired of it.  It also helps that he's got an incredible comic genius as his side kick to bounce stuff off of.  Tracey Ullman.  This is also one of her best works.

The story follows Woody Allen as an ex-bank robber married to Tracey Ullman who dreams of living the life of luxury.  He gathers his thuggish friends for one more bank robbing trip where he'll make it big enough so he doesn't have to do it anymore.  He has his wife, Tracey Ullman, set up a shop front where she bakes and sells cookies.  Meanwhile, Woody and his pals are busy digging a tunnel underground in hopes of having an opening that takes them right to the local banks vault a few doors down.  What he doesn't count on is his wife's cookie shop becomes a huge success and the press gets wind of it and all sorts of attention are on Tracey Ullman's cookie shop.  They soon realize they don't need to rob a bank as they're making enough money with the cookie shop.  They end up expanding and growing bigger than ever.  They begin wrestling with the tortures of fame and money.  This is an enjoyable comedic little film worth watching more than once!",1345248000,,1348,4.383064516129032
1265777,4,B00003CXGR,"Even a dozen years ago, Woody Allen had achieved the rare status of being a movie maker who did not have to come up with a Hamlet or Glass Menagerie every time out. He could, as he did here, produce a light film, with no greater pretensions than to give his customers a pleasant time in a movie house or at home before the TV. In that aim, he has succeeded admirably. They say that the major reason he can turn out his films on a regular basis, with no fear that his financing will be pulled out from his next scheduled production, is that he always come out at or under budget. No huge costly overruns, no great risk for the producing organization. They know he might lose them some money, make them some money and, every now and then, make them a very comfortable amount of money. However, millions and tens of millions down the drain, is not what they can ever expect. As a result, he can get a few ideas, sometimes out of the Joe Miller book of old movie plots, put together a cast, usually almost entirely made up of skilled professionals, provide a background of wonderful old tunes, and then satisfy the core audience he has built up over a half-century or so. Probably, the occasional hits, add some new members to his permanent audience. The outcome is the kind of audience that 19th century novelists, today's mega-hit mystery, thriller, and romance story writers, and only a very few movie directors in the history of film could count on: an audience they know will be there for each of their  products as they came out, not an audience, as is true of most films and novels today, that must be built up for each new release.
At any rate, for anyone who enjoys Tracy and Hepburn, Power and Loy, Cary Grant and almost anyone, this will be a pleasant, light-hearted, humorous and, yes, somewhat familiar hour and a half. In addition, what a pleasure to see the likes of the two Elaines, Strich and May, doing just a bit to show what mistresses they were of the medium, Tracey Ullman pairs well with Allen, the actor, and Hugh Grant is suitably suave and grasping as a nice guy who, maybe, isn't so nice.
All in all, not in contention for Best Comedy of the Decade, but a winning, gratifying, ingratiating film to see.",1334016000,,2225,4.440097799511002
1265778,5,B00003CXGR,"Part of a nice trinity with Hollywood Ending and Curse of the Jade Scorpion. I dig the laid back feel of these movies with the quick zingers and an overarching storyline that charms.  I became a fan of Allen with his classic movies, but too many times over the years he's been overly crass or dramatic in many efforts. For me Allen is best with a nuerotic smile on his face and song in his heart, laid back and laying out the one-liners.",1271030400,,437,4.265060240963855
1265779,4,B00003CXGR,This movie was recommended to me by a friend since my wife is starting up a baking business.  It's a cute Woody Allen movie with all the great comic relief I expected.  It has a stellar and well chosen cast.  It's a good time!,1266105600,,226,4.090909090909091
1265909,5,B00003CXGR,"First, let me say I am NOT a Woody Allen fan.  I find far too
many of his films to be embarrassing and forced.  However,
there is always an exception to the rule....and THIS is a film
which I recommend to anyone who wants to relax, have a good
time, laugh a lot, and watch the logically, and hysterically-
funny unfolding plot of a very, very, VERY funny movie!

Poor Woody Allen!  His character here can't even rob a bank
successfully...and his ""helpers"" only make things worse!  Tracy
Ulman, as his wife, bakes cookies -- this is an IMPORTANT part
of the beginning of the film, (I can see you're puzzled by this...but probably smiling already at the ridiculous juxtaposition of words).  To say WHY Ms. Ullman's baking cookiies is an important part of the beginning of the story would give away too much of the plot...but believe me, her cookies ARE very important.  Also -- you may never look at people who wear miner's hats the same way, ever again.....(?)  Yes, you read that correctly!

HUGH GRANT, whose acting style -- and characters -- are mostly 180 degrees away from Woody Allen's, is also on board, in the latter part of the movie.  These three -- plus supporting players -- make this movie a truly PERFECT comedy.  What makes it a perfect comedy is that everything is so LOGICAL...no situation, no matter how ridiculous, seems forced.  It is the low-I.Q., (and really STUPID!), characters of the movie who commit these blunders....for them, the funny mistakes and hilarious consequences just come naturally.

If you need a laugh...watch this movie.  If you think Woody Allen can only do movies with ""angst"" in them....watch this movie.  It is, in its own ""small"" way, one of the funniest movies ever made, and deserves a far wider audience.

Enjoy it!  (And, if possible, have your favourite type of cookies on hand, to mumch while you watch!)  : )

: ) .....  : ( ..... : ) .....  : ( .....  : ) ..... : ( .....

pS:  A SERIOUS NOTE HERE, IF I MAY:  Looking at other reviews, mentioning that most of the characters in it had ""low-I.Q.s"", and the undeniable fact that these ""low-I.Q."" characters in the film DID do really STUPID things, led me to ponder upon, and realize the difference between being stupid, (whatever one's IQ), and low I.Q. people who happen to be retarded.  I myself have a cousin who is retarded -- slightly.  She has a job as a bus-girl in a restaurant...and everyone she works with likes her immensely.  She could easily become a waitress, with a rise in status and in pay...but the numerical calculations involved are beyond her (present!) mental capacity.  She was, however, quite smart enough to divorce a husband she found difficult to live with -- perhaps a little later than a person with an ""average"" IQ would -- but she did do it!  She KNOWS her limits, and lives within them -- though she is constantly striving to increase her mental skills....

STUPID people, however, seem NOT to know their limits -- or realize they HAVE any limits, and so NEVER strive to get beyond them.  For instance, people with VERY high I.Q.s, in fact, were quite easily swindled by Bernard Madoff!  I happen to know I have a near-genuis I.Q. -- but I've made some REAL stupid blunders in my life.  However, I acknowlege these blunders and seek to improve
myself and not do such things again!  The STUPID people in the movie ""Small Time Crooks"" however, thought they needed no improvement in their mental skills.  No -- they weren't retarded. Their I.Q.s -- though perhaps higher than my cousin's -- however, were NOT put to good use. They did NOT know their limits, nor did they, (as my cousin has -- and as I have, too), strive to improve themselves in any way.  ""Why improve myself?"" these characters, (and real-life people like them), must think.  ""I'm perfect already!""  I suppose that's the difference between being merely retarded, and abysmally stupid -- in this movie, hysterically stupid --people.  Being swindled by someone like Bernard Madoff does not mean a person is stupid -- but believing oneself to be perfect, truly is.  Therein lies the difference.  Low-I.Q. has nothing, really, to do with stupidity.  But not being able to see that perhaps, just perhaps, one MIGHT be choosing the wrong thing do, has everything to do with it!

Stupidity knows no I.Q.!",1258848000,,4294,4.675567423230975
1265910,4,B00003CXGR,"I'm not always a big fan of Woody Allen's films but he and Tracey Ullman make a great pair in this 95-minute farce. Ullman has to be one of the most talented ladies to never achieve real movie stardom. She matches Allen laugh-for-laugh in here and, in some respects, even steals the show.

""Small Time Crooks"" has a real classic-film feel to it, one of those old bickering spouse films but with more modern-day humor. Allen and Ullman trade some very funny insults, and there are many of these quality gags. Ullman is just plain hilarious as the bimbo-like ""Frenchy.""

Add a gigolo (Hugh Grant), a couple of inept crooks, a couple of old-time favorites, Elaine Strich and  Elaine May, and a pretty funny premise and you have some good entertainment and an underrated Allen film.",1240704000,,778,4.705882352941177
1265911,3,B00003CXGR,"Small Time Crooks is not classic Woody, but it certainly isn't pretentious or boring. The plot is fantastic and it's hard to suspend disbelief but a lot of the jokes here work. It's hard to say the same thing about his other recent releases, however. I would say that, as a director, Allen's been in full-fledged decline since Husbands and Wives, but this movie is small in scale and accomplishes its task. I like Tracey Ullman and thought she excelled in her role. Allen's script dances on the tightrope between condescension and humor in regards to these characters but in the end obtains respectable results.",1227225600,,611,4.828571428571428
1265912,3,B00003CXGR,"Everyone I hope recognizes that, if one lives long enough, that one is bound to start recycling ideas. That is the case here with Woody Allen's partial revival of his early film classic Take the Money and Run, with a class twist. Here Roy (Allen's character) is just as dimwitted as old Virgil of Take the Money but as an older and wiser man he knows when to quit (for a while anyway). So when Roy and his associates' attempted bank robbery is foiled by his bugling his wife's successful cookie shop cover operation sees them through the rough spots, again for a while. After a trip through the wilds of bourgeois New York the couple, after some disasters personal and financial, go back to the old tricks of the trade. I am not altogether sure what this says about class mobility in a democratic society but Roy please do not call me for your next caper. Funny, in Allen's slapstick way, in spots but not his best in this genre.",1203379200,,929,4.43859649122807
1265913,2,B00003CXGR,"This movie struck me as being similar in tone to Take the Money and Run, a much older Woody movie that he stars in as an inept bank robber.  Small Time Crooks starts off the same, with Woody and his rag tag group of wannabe crooks who are working at tunneling underground to a nearby bank.  The cookie bakery his wife, played by Tracy Ullman, is using as a front for the operation ends up becoming an overnight success which turns them into millionaires.

From that point on, the movie stopped being entertaining.  It really does just come to a screeching halt.  Practically nothing interesting happens from this point on with Woody and Tracy, and the rest of the cast is pretty much discarded with.  There was far too much of Tracy in this movie and Hugh Grant just bored me everytime he was on screen.  Jon Lovitz, Michael Rapaport and Tony Darrow are completely underused as Woody's gang.  Elaine May actually turned out to be pretty funny as Tracy's dim bulb cousin and should have had more screen time.

I was really hoping to see more of the old Woody spirit in here, but it just felt really unimaginative.  Not to say that he's completely lost it.  Scoop is a good recent example of Woody recapturing that old magic again, but this one just missed the mark with me.",1194480000,,1272,4.48695652173913
1265914,3,B00003CXGR,"Small Time Crooks is Woody Lite, well worth a three star rating.  It is a fun little movie with some very engaging actors including Tracy Ullman and Hugh Grant.  This is good fun, if not memorable.  It hearkens back to the older Woody movies that are fun for the sake of being fun.",1184716800,,281,4.264150943396227
1265915,4,B00003CXGR,"""Small Time Crooks"" is a unique type of love story that seems like a cross between ""Guys and Dolls"", ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"", and ""Take the Money and Run"".  I was going to add ""without the music"" but I really enjoyed the music in ""Small Time Crooks"" as I do with almost all of Woody Allen's post-""Annie Hall"" movies.

This movie is more on the humorous side like the earlier Allen movies.  Woody's humor usually had a lot of political and mostly social satire as the core of his humor and ""Small Time Crooks"" is no exception.  What makes it a cut above some of his earlier comedies is his focus on the pitfalls of trying to become someone and/or something you're not and probably never will be.  Through this window, Allen is able to poke fun at both the wannabes and the established in High Society.

The movie begins with a look at a bumbling small time crook named Ray Winkler, played by Woody Allen.  His ""gang"" is about as inept as he is (maybe even more so since they follow his lead).  The brilliant plan of theirs metamorphs itself into something else entirely and they all get a look at what they supposedly want out of life.  The problem is that their dreams were really just nightmares in disguise.

Ray's wife Frenchy is the real lead in ""Small Time Crooks"" and it is she who develops the highest asperations.  Her reach for elegance extends well beyond Ray's bewilderment as to his own future.  In the end, they discover their own common wants and needs were in the familiar territory that they left behind.  I don't think I'm giving anything away with that synopsis because the movie's humor keeps us attentive throughout and can be enjoyed on its' own; with or without a morality play.  However, Woody Allen's genius as a director is that he cannot create a story without making a statement.  ""Small Time Crooks"" is good enough as comedy to leave the statement optional.",1178150400,3,1890,4.566765578635015
1265916,4,B00003CXGR,"Even though Tracey Ullman is a quarter-century younger than Woody Allen, her spot-on comic turn as his tacky manicurist wife makes her the filmmaker's most compatible co-star since Diane Keaton. Together, they winningly play Ray and Frenchy, a vulgar, working-class married couple who rent a restaurant space in order to rob the bank next door. The twist is that Frenchy's cookie business thrives, and they become wealthy beyond their dreams. Written and directed by Allen, this surprisingly free-wheeling 2000 comedy contains little of the deeper life themes that Allen had been exploring for the previous two decades. For the most part, it represents a complete throwback to his first film as a director, the frenetic, nonsensical 1969's ""Take the Money and Run"", as both are character-driven slapstick farces with a slew of funny one-liners.

The film starts out strong with Ray and his bumbling partners preparing the heist with every conceivable complication standing in their way, in particular, their own stupidity. The storyline makes a unique turn once Ray and Frenchy become successful. They open up a nationwide chain of cookie stores, move to the posh Upper East Side like the Jeffersons, and start hobnobbing with Manhattan's social elite. Their marriage begins to unravel when Frenchy becomes obsessed with being cultured, while Ray is happy to live his life the same way as before. I don't think the movie is consistently flat-out funny like Allen's earlier works, but it does boast a sterling comedy cast. Freed from his intellectual pretensions, Allen looks like he's having a good time playing the unapologetically guttural Ray. Sporting a convincing New Yawk accent, Ullman, the most chameleonic of comic mimics, dexterously captures the ongoing battle between Frenchy's aspirations for social acceptance and her innately tawdry sensibilities.

Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz play Ray's trio of thick-skulled cohorts with lan, though they unfortunately disappear for the film's second half. It's good to see Elaine May back onscreen playing Ray's ditzy cousin May, and her crack timing with Allen makes me wish she would resuscitate her clever comedy routines with her ex-husband, film director Mike Nichols. As Frenchy's Pygmalion teacher of art and manners, Hugh Grant plays to his suave persona with subtle venality. The film ends almost like a parable albeit with a hilarious development inspired by the cocktail party scene in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Notorious"". Allen must be quite a fan since he would later use the same plot device in ""Scoop"". This is lightweight fare though certainly among Allen's most entertaining movies of late. The 2000 DVD provides the theatrical trailer as its only significant extra.",1168732800,4,2746,5.324884792626728
1265917,4,B00003CXGR,"I'm not a huge Woody Allen fan, that being said, this movie is hilarious.  From the one liners by Tracey Ulmann to the slapstick to the sheer stupidity, this is a great movie.

All of the performances are wonderful.  Especially notable is Tracey Ulmann and Hugh Grant's coupling, he is teaching her how to be ""cultured"" and she is trying really hard.  She is also memorizing the dictionary.

I also loved the party scene at Elaine Stritch's.  IT is too funny.

Great to watch more than once.",1164758400,2,491,4.574712643678161
1265918,3,B00003CXGR,"This film kind of reminds me of Steve Martin's career shift.  At first Martin's roles were downright hilarious, but as time went by, he shifted from being hilarious to what I would call, ""charming.""  Instead of making you laugh, his movies make you smile.  Woody Allen seems to be exploring this kind of style in Small Time Crooks.

Unlike Allen's most loved films, this one isn't chock full of witty jokes.  Instead, it's full of lighthearted and amusing situations that keep the viewer entertained without actually delivering big laughs.

Allen plays Ray, an ex-criminal who attempts a bank robbery.  He goes about it in a rather simple manner - buying a place close to the bank and digging an underground tunnel.  To avoid suspicion, he disguises the place he buys as a cookie store.  Unexpectedly, the fake cookie store actually ends up selling a lot of cookies, while the tunnel idea fails miserably.  Ray and his wife become exceedingly rich and start growing apart as a result.  Eventually their business fails at the hands of fraudulent accountants, and when this happens, the two come back together again.  It's heart-warming.

I was surprised to see trailers of this on TV, and I wanted to go see the film in a theater, but I'm glad I didn't.  It wasn't really what I expected, so I was somewhat let down.  However, after seeing it two or three times, I've grown to like it somewhat, because of its charm and its calming factor.  For instance, there are a few scenes near the end where Ray dates his wife's sister but the storyline doesn't go anywhere.  The scenes just drift around calmly.  The movie is just very calm like that.  Even during scenes like the flood in the cookie store basement, and the bankruptcy of the cookie company, the movie maintains that calm feeling throughout.  You never really think, ""Oh my gosh, so-and-so's life is ruined,"" since their worst point is at the beginning of the film.

If you want a calm, charming movie with a PG rating (my favorite rating) I highly recommend Small Time Crooks.  If you want a film loaded with laughs, find something else.",1154131200,3,2094,4.710743801652892

There are simply not enough jokes here. You'll feel comforable watching it, but not laughing. Two-third of the csat disappears before the middle of the movie (Michael Rapaport and Levitz), and at least we get an Elain May in top form.

1266031,2,B00003CXGR,"Why?
Why did you do it, Woody? Sure, the premise of Small Time Crooks was interesting - but then I felt the same way when I saw it the FIRST time on television -  on Car 54, Where Are You? back in the 1950s! Created by Nat Hiken (who also wrote many episodes), that classic cop situation comedy had many very funny plots.
Plots that included the one about the small band of crooks, three male and one female, that open a business next to a New York bank in order to break into the vault next door. But business gets too good, proving to be a huge distraction to the original plan of emptying the bank of its big bucks, and hilarity ensues.
Sound familiar? It should - since Woody obviously lifted that entire scenario in order to make his far-inferior STC film! At first I thought maybe he wrote the original Car 54 script in question, and can therefore do whatever he wants to with his own property. But I checked it out, and no, he did not write that Car 54 script.
(BTW, Tracey Ullman is also particularly terrible in this - she's a Brit playing an Italian who's named Frenchy - try figuring out THAT cultural mess!)
So what happened Woody? Was the white paper in your typewriter that blank? Was your writers' block that insurmountable? Sure, one can always say it's not exactly script-stealing as long as a writer at least slightly changes a plot twist or a line of dialogue here or there, but c'mon, Woody, who did you think you'd fool?

1266032,4,B00003CXGR,"Though essentially a time-marking throwaway by writer/director Woody Allen, ""Small Time Crooks"" provides so many gems of shining performances that one can overlook the film's derivative plotting and overall lack of comic drive.
In this film, Allen more or less abandons his customary obsession with big city neuroses and middle-aged angst in favor of a more straightforward, plot-driven comedy, paying homage in its patchwork and eclectic story to any number of earlier well-known theatrical and cinematic works.
The somewhat slapstick theme revolves around a hapless couple that accidentally creates a mega-corporation out of a cookie store that is intended to be a front for a bank robbery. Of course, nothing goes as planned, and with one outrageous skit after another, Allen examines the difference between class and wealth, as Ray and Frenchy try to retro-fit into high society.
The highlight of the film comes in the form of a brilliantly satiric pseudo-60 Minutes report in which Steve Kroft himself chronicles the meteoric rise that this ragtag collection of accidental entrepreneurs takes from obscure small business owners to multi-million dollar corporate giants "" a report that pokes affectionate fun at the clichd rags-to-riches theme so essential to the beloved concept of the ""American Dream.""
Special note must be made of some of the actors, prime among them Ullman and the always brilliant Elaine May who, as Frenchy's adenoidal, utterly befuddled and endearingly obtuse cousin, returns to her ""A New Leaf"" roots and provides some of the sweetest comic moments in the film. Hugh Grant is convincing in his own way, without trying too hard.
The film offers a number of dazzling performances to relish, some good situational gaffes, and a lot of time-tested worldly wisdom. Overall not  a bad package. Recommended rental.",1081900800,5,1836,5.309278350515464

1266035,5,B00003CXGR,"This movie is downright silly, and I loved every second of it!  It's good to see Woody Allen writing, directing, and acting in a comedy movie.  So much has been made about this man's personal life that people forget his professional talents.
Woody Allen and Tracy Ullman play a husband and wife in the style of Fred & Ethel Mertz of ""I Love Lucy"".  They constantly bicker at each other, but it still remains an obviously loving relationship.
As the movie begins, Allen's character, Ray, is an ex-con who works as a dish washer, and Ullman plays his manicurist wife, Frenchy.  They have exactly $6,000 between them, and they've decided to pool their money with other partners in order to execute a plan to rob a bank.  They rent a storefront that neighbors the bank and plan on digging a tunnel from the store to inside the bank's vault.  The storefront is turned into a cookie shop as a cover for their operation.  The bank robbery idea goes sour, but ironically, the cookie shop flourishes, and the next thing you know, Ray and Frenchy are heading up their own giant cookie corporation.  Frenchy decides that she'd like to join the ranks of the classy elite, so she buddies with an art dealer (played by Hugh Grant) and asks him to teach her how to live a lifestyle of affluence.  Ray wants no part of this lifestyle, and his relationship with Frenchy begins to suffer.  By the end of the movie, their cookie empire crumbles and Frenchy finds out that the art dealer is using her for her money, so Ray and Frenchy must come together again to salvage some money and escape to Florida.
All of this seems like alot to cram into a movie that's only 95 minutes long, but it all happens very fast, and in a very comical way.  Woody Allen and Tracy Ullman are great in their roles, and the supporting cast complements them very nicely.  This movie is a definite must-see.",1042156800,14,1865,4.517857142857143

The casting of this director can sometimes seem repetitive, as we see the same faces appear again and again in his films, however he manages to inject new life here with Tracey Ullman and Hugh Grant, neither of whom is exactly challenged by the material. But it's good fun. You see Allen waving his hands about in parallel whilst talking about his neuroses, and there's a crime of the century caper plot to keep the jokes coming. The real casting question is, how long can Allen continue to play the slightly nerdy, romantically unfulfilled intellectual he was playing when he was twenty.

1266135,4,B00003CXGR,"The World Trade Center tragedy makes movie-watching seem patently frivolous, but somehow the more serious the movie the more frivolous it seems.  Perhaps the films that offer the greatest distance from the September 11th events are musicals and comedies.  So last night I watched Woody Allen's ""Small Time Crooks.""  The first half ranks with his funniest movies.  But as they say in show biz, you gotta have a second act.  Allen's recent films have had powerful first acts but flopped in the second act.  I'm thinking about films such as ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" ""Mighty Aphrodite,"" ""Stardust Memories,"" ""Deconstructing Harry,"" and ""Small Time Crooks.""  The premise of the latter is well-known; you can't miss it even on the video or DVD box.  Woody and pals set out to rob a bank by tunneling under a rented shop next to the bank; to keep up the front, Woody's wife (Tracey Ullman) sells cookies; but the cookies become a hit, get franchised, and Woody and co. become filthy rich.  This all happens, presumably, before they finish digging the tunnel.  Act One is lively and quick; indeed, more rapid-fire than any previous Allen comedy that I can remember.  This is largely due to Tracey Ullman, who Allen said was the funniest person he's ever worked with. Her comic timing is flawless, almost as good as Carole Lombard.  (Still, in my book Ullman isn't really as funny as Diane Keaton, who may not have been as zippy but whose facial expressions in films such as ""Love and Death"" and ""Annie Hall"" were simply over the top.  Years later one can remember her facial expressions even as the movie is forgotten, like the grin of the Cheshire cat.)
When Woody and Tracey turn nouveau-riche, the Second Act begins and withers away.  Making fun of the nouveau riche is easy, but Allen needed a script writer who could take the humor beyond the obvious.  The best part of the Second Act is Hugh Grant's turn as a con man for Ullman seeking a crash course in aesthetics.  He's very good in this role, although not nearly as good or funny as Michael Caine in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels""--a delightful movie through and through.)
People have said that the more films Allen turns out, the more one appreciates his early comedies.  In fact, a student says this of Allen himself in ""Stardust Memories.""  I think it's true.  ""Annie Hall"" must reign as the most accomplished film.  The funniest, I think, are ""Love and Death"" and ""Bananas,"" with ""Sleeper"" a close third.  ""Play it Again Sam"" has a better plot than these, and may come in second to ""Annie Hall"" for the all-around award.  Many of Allen's early movies owe their success to editor Ralph Rosenblum', who took the various ""bits"" that Allen filmed and strung them together into feature-length movies.  It seems to me that Allen has unfairly played down Rosenblum's contribution.  But Allen's films have suffered ever since Rosenblum left.  Allen is a good director, but when he supervises the editing he lacks objectivity--a common fault among directors who insist on editing or on having the final cut.  That being said, I have to concede that the first half of ""Small Time Crooks"" was very well edited; it's as if Allen's editing is improving with on-the-job training.  Still, he lost it in the second act.",1001203200,2,3254,4.795332136445243
1266136,5,B00003CXGR,"This movie bears repeated viewing. It really only gets better. Tracey Ullman, Elaine May et. al. all played their cooky parts hilariously. The main thing I love about Woody is he lets people do their characters so realistically, and allows lower-key performances that are more true to life. A couple of the crew (who I've seen before in his films, just can't remember their names) are just brilliant stupid crooks -- people I can believe I'd have met (at least, in NYC) before.

Even comparing Small Time Crooks to other recent films of Allen's (let alone his masterpieces of the 70s & 80s...you know which ones), there's none of the fun found in Bullets over Broadway and Mighty Aphrodite, the dark wit found in Deconstructing Harry, or the quiet soulfulness of Sweet & Lowdown.

1266138,4,B00003CXGR,"The first time I saw this, I hated it, which is odd for me and a Woody Allen film. I think the reason is the somewhat unexpected turn the film takes when Woody and the gang are caught by the cop. It seems I had created my own expectation about where the film was going and didn't give it a chance after that.
I am glad to report after four viewings I really like this little farce. Woody is great as always-he plays a ""small time crook"" who is always looking for a big score but doesn't have the brains to pull it off. Tracey Ullman is delightful as Allen's wife and reluctant partner in crime. The gals will love Hugh Grant as a sophisticated but unscrupulous art dealer and Elaine May is excellent as Ullman's dim-witted cousin.
This DVD comes with all the features we have come to expect from Woody-none! Well, there are production notes and cast bios and a trailer but this is single sided single layer all the way.
Summing up, this won't go down in history as one of Woody's best, but it is still worth getting for fans like myself.",998092800,3,1037,4.295918367346939

The opening scenes are funny, the characters successfully sketched, and Allen's typical man-on-the-edge-paranoia, displayed in humorous neurotic style.  But, later in the movie, when the novelties of Allen and Ullman's character's wear off, when all of the jokes in the previews have been unearthed, the movie begins to dull down. It then becomes fairly unfunny, and the examination of their marriage as it falls apart isn't terribly interesting. I was pleased to see Allen returning to an older formula: his caper style films as opposed to the terrible, misogynist crap he's been doling out of late. Unfortunatly, this is one of those films that shows all of the goods in the previews, so much in fact, that if you've seen the previews, don't bother with the movie, unless you want the jokes you've already seen and heard spaced out.",996192000,,1020,4.817142857142857

The plot is thin and implausible while not really being funny.  The concluding half hour has a canned, almost desperate-to-finish quality.

It's a slapsticky comedy that will remind fans of his earlier work (particularly ""Sleeper"", ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask"", ""Bananas"", etc.), but whereas those films framed its comedy within a fresh and original concept, the new film plays as a broad, familiar comedy comprised of more one-liners than you can possibly keep track of.  With that said, this film isn't as bad as most film critics have made it out to be.  The jokes come fast and often, and they crackle for the most part.  The second half of the film loses some steam but I still heard myself laughing out loud on more than several occasions.  I loved the bickering between Tracy Ullman and Woody.  I loved the buddies Ray brings along on his bungled caper (too bad they were given such limited screen time, especially Jon Lovitz).

1266254,4,B00003CXGR,"If you're a Woody Allen fan, you probably won't be disappointed in SMALL TIME CROOKS. The film is a departure from some of his more recent work and more like his earlier film TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN with Louise Lasseter. His existential tone is not obvious, though not completely missing either.
SMALL TIME CROOKS is downright slapstick early on, and then the film takes a subtle and serious twist. In some places I laughed so hard I dampened my drawers--and believe me some of these folks wear drawers while others are supposedly top drawer. In a sense the film is a spoof on class snobbery.
Whether she is making dough or not, the clothing the fabulous Frenchie (Tracy Ullman) wears is vintage. Frenchie began her career as a topless go-go girl in New Jersey, where Woody's character met her when he was working as a numbers runner. The lime-green stretch pants she sports while preparing his sausage-meatball meals served with a plate stacked high with white Wonder bread leave nothing to the imagination.
Elaine Stritich and Elaine May and the perennial George Grizzard are all aging members of the NYC Manhattan upper crust--all of whom take an interest in the new cookie-fortune magnate Frenchie because they're after her dough for ""charitable"" purposes.
Hugh Grant seems to have made the transition from roles portraying dignified innocents to roles where he maintains his some of his dignity. I used to like Grant in romantic leads like Chopinski in IMPROMTU before the LA fiasco. I wondered what he would do for a living after his encounter with Ms. Brown, not because I was sitting in moral judgment but because it was hard to believe he was innocent any longer.
Grant is quite good in SMALL TIME CROOKS in which he plays a disengenious antique dealer/wine expert/former vineyard owner who has among other things spent time in a Buddist monastery in Japan. As a Professor Higgins to the newly rich Frenchie/Frances he is a pip.
As he often does, Woody wrote/directed/produced the film and played the lead. Who would have thought he could keep up!! Yet, here he is, the aging film star who doesn't look like Cary Grant. Woody's films appeal to a select group of us, many of whom probably look like aging Diane Keatons and Alan Aldas and some of whom have spent time in Buddist temples.",989193600,6,2293,4.778337531486146

I was unbelievably disappointed with ""Small Time Crooks"". I thought it would be hilarious. It was, before the one-year jump. Afterwards, everything became incredibly insipid. Because the DVDs were all taken, I was resorted to renting the VHS tape. I was lucky, in a way, because I could stop the movie and take it out to see how much more I had to watch.  I have always enjoyed Allen's self-deprecating whining, but I found his character, Ray, hugely annoying. Ray's whining just grated on my nerves. This movie is just a mess. The plot is structureless, the characters prove to be more dimwitted than Frenchy's cousin, May, which I actually found to be the smartest one. Most of all what's got me steamed is that it has no moral at all. I LOVE movies with serious and funny morals.

Woody Allen brought together an amazing cast including Jon Lovitz who was absolutely perfect for his role, Michael Rappaport, and Hugh Grant.

Ullman is particularly fine as the brassy, uncouth wife who falls prey to Grant's slithering opportunistic rich boy.  Elaine May, however, walks away with the film as Ullman's daffy, kind hearted sister, May.

1266402,2,B00003CXGR,"Woody Allen has made a career - a rather successful one - out of variations on a theme. That theme usually centers around the same style of intellectual, neurotic character, more often than not played by Allen himself. In Small Time Crooks, he breaks out of that mold to play an incompetent, immoral, blue-collar criminal.
This isn't entirely new territory for Allen. It was done rather successfully in the character of Virgil Starkwell in Take The Money And Run. This, however, was in one of his ""earlier, funnier"" films, where a shoestring plot served to hold together a series of hilarious gags like a misspelled hold-up note. In Small Time Crooks, Allen tries to moralize. He's done it successfully in the past, but this time, it results in a rare failure.
The acting and directing, though somewhat flat, aren't to blame. The script, however, falls short of achieving its lofty goals. There are underlying themes of ""money corrupts,"" ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks,"" ""money can't buy happiness,"" and other horrendous clichs. But simply put, this film has no heart. You'll laugh - don't get me wrong - but you won't come out of this film with the usual sense of satisfaction that Allen's films have brought in the past.

The plan is simple...set up a cookie shop and have your wife run it (because she makes the BEST cookies, this serves as a big part in the plot), while you and the other bumbling crooks are digging a hole in the basement, a hole that will lead to the bank, and to the biggest heist you have ever pulled off.
""Small Time Crooks"" is a very funny movie.  It starts off with the bank heist plan (the digging in the basement contains some  of the biggest laughs in this movie), and then in an unexpected twist shows that crime doesn't pay.  The movie then goes into the study of Allen and Ullman struggling to deal with their new found wealth and each other.
In his funniest film in years, Woody Allen has assembled a great cast; Hugh Grant, John Lovitz, Michael Rappaport, George Grizzard, Tony Darrow, and Elaine May in the outrageously funny role of the dim-witted cousin.

It is a much lighter film than most of his recent ouvre, but the frequent suggestion that this movie is unphilosophical is false -- there is a message in the film about the futility of trying to transcend one's working-class roots, a rather undemocratic sentiment.  Nonetheless, the movie mostly is going for yuks instead of trying to make a statement, and at that level it succeeds.

That scheme goes arye, but their cookies sell like hot-cakes.  It is a very funny movie that stars Michael Rapaport, Jon Lovitz, Tracey Ulman, and Hugh Grant.  In my opinion Tracey Ullman steals the show with her witty funny self.  But anyone who enjoys Woody Allen's movies should see this one.  Believe me, it's worth it.",979862400,,551,4.618556701030927
1266406,1,B00003CXGR,"This DVD was so wonderful I and everyone watching it, fell asleep 45 thrilling minutes into it.  I am a huge fan of both Jon Lovitz and Michael Rappaport, and was expecting this to be a good old fashioned comedy without all of the sexual preversion found in many recent comedies.  I was wrong, it wasn't even a comedy.  It was an extremely annoying movie being that Woody Allen talks the entire time, and never shuts  up long enough for anyone to get a word in edgewise.  I have seen and enjoyed other Woody Allen movies, but not this one.  I would strongly suggest that you keep your money and spend it elsewhere.",979603200,3,614,4.389380530973451

Rent it only if you are really compulsive to see every Woody Allen movie.  Very slow and predictable.  You were warned.",979257600,2,402,4.306666666666667

1266409,3,B00003CXGR,"Though essentially a time-marking throwaway by writer/director Woody Allen, `Small Time Crooks' provides so many gems of performance that one can overlook the film's derivative plotting and overall lack of comic drive. In this film, Allen more or less abandons his customary obsession with big city neuroses and middle-aged angst in favor of a more straightforward, plot-driven comedy, paying homage in its patchwork and eclectic story to any number of earlier well-known theatrical and cinematic works.
For example, the first half hour of the movie plays like a stateside version of the 1950's Italian comedy `Big Deal on Madonna Street' as a team of bumbling, far-from-intelligent small time crooks, led by ex-con Ray Winkler (Allen), sets up a cookie store as a `front' so they can drill a tunnel into a bank a mere two or three shops down the road. Then the plot of the film suddenly shifts gears when that plan falls apart and the gang hits pay dirt with the surprising success of the cookies that Ray's uncultured but well meaning wife, the former topless dancer Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), is assiduously baking and selling. The highlight of the film comes in the form of a brilliantly satiric pseudo-60 Minutes report in which Steve Kroft himself chronicles the meteoric rise that this ragtag collection of accidental entrepreneurs takes from obscure small business owners to multi-million dollar corporate giants - a report that pokes affectionate fun at the clichd rags-to-riches theme so essential to our concept of the beloved American Dream.
With this plot switch, we leave Madonna Street and head into `Unsinkable Molly Brown/Pygmalion/Educating Rita' territory as the vulgar, uncouth Frenchy realizes that, even with all her suddenly acquired wealth, she cannot possibly gain true acceptance from the elite cultural snobs she so desperately wants to impress without a little assistance from her own personal Henry Higgins, who arrives in the form of an art dealer named David played by the suave Hugh Grant. Thus, as Frenchy branches out and begins to open herself up to new cultural experiences, the couple begins to drift apart as Ray comes to crave the return to the simpler life of spaghetti and meatball dinners he knows they have left far behind.
Had Allen been able to sustain the cleverness and bite that inform that `60 Minutes' segment throughout the length of the entire film, `Small Time Crooks' might have emerged as more than just the mere piece of entertaining puffery it ultimately is. Indeed, we find ourselves laughing only occasionally and often at jokes or sight gags that would barely register a chuckle in one of Allen's more sophisticated, more edgy and more character-driven works. Special note must, however, be made of some of the actors, prime among them Ullman and the always brilliant Elaine May who, as Frenchy's adenoidal, utterly befuddled and endearingly obtuse cousin, returns to her `A New Leaf' roots and provides some of the sweetest comic moments in the film. Unfortunately, Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz, as members of Ray's gang, though they all three give outstanding performances, aren't given enough screen time to really let their talents for comic characterization take flight. Hugh Grant is essentially Hugh Grant - which is to say that he fulfills the requirements of his part without having to stretch his thespian muscles too much.
The success or failure of a comedy is ultimately determined by how often it is able to elicit laughs from the person watching it. Given that criterion, `Small Time Crooks' rates no better than a mild recommendation (though there is one very funny scene involving safecracking near the end of the film). Yet, if for no other reason than to relish a number of its dazzling performances, `Small Time Crooks' certainly earns at least a casual once-over from any Allen devotee. Guess we have no choice but to mark time right along with him!",978825600,2,3943,5.067692307692307
1266509,3,B00003CXGR,"A group of incompetent crooks fail miserably at their latest scheme, but unintentionally find fabulous success in a totally different venture, which leads to its own complications.
Not since the late 80s with Crimes and Misdemeanors has Allen created such a tightly-crafted and totally natural film. The jump cutting is gone, the shaky camera is nowhere to be seen, the obscure artistic allusions completely absent. Instead, Allen packs this little gem with one of the best ensemble casts he's had in years, including the amazingly-talented Tracey Ullman (who seems to have been made to play opposite Woody), the endearingly idiosyncratic Elaine May (another Allen first) and the sophisticated straight foil Hugh Grant.
Critics heralding the return of the early and funny Allen fail to notice that this isn't exactly a nostalgic trip through the world of Bananas or Love and Death. On the contrary, patches of warmth and sweetness are all over the place -- sure there are more sight gags here than in his last five films combined, but sympathetic and believable characterization is also here in buckets. Think of it as a funnier, less earnest Hannah and Her Sisters, sure to become one of its director's most beloved films in years to come. And finally there is some justice in the world, for not only is this his best film in a decade, it's also his most financially successful in years.",978048000,8,1388,4.96137339055794

He plans to buy a store which is adjacent to the bank and then to make an underground tunnel to the bank vault.  When he asks his wife, played by Tracey Ullman, to help finance the project, she balks.  Eventually she gives in and becomes his ""front man"" by baking cookies in the store they buy.  The cookies become unbelievably successful and suddenly they are richer than in their wildest dreams.  Tracey decides that she must become more cultured to fit into their new social set and she asks an art dealer, played by Hugh Grant, to tutor her in the social graces.  This he does willingly with an eye to cashing in on her fortune.  This movie is well-written and well-acted.  The lines are witty and there is even a moral here with regard to love and loyalty.  No Woody Allen darkness here--just a delightful 90-minute romp!",978048000,,904,4.4969325153374236

Frenchie did a great job in it- it was so funny watching her move her pathetic little self putting baked cookies on one paper plate.  Her attitude is so funny!

1266512,3,B00003CXGR,"Allen takes a refreshing break from his recent ""Sour'n'Dour"" sensibilities and returns to an old-fashioned Woodman goof. Woody's befuddled wannabe grand larcenist and his dopey gang of lovable morons(particularly Jon Lovitz) provide plenty of belly laughs for the first third of the film; the story takes an unexpected 180 degree turn that initially throws off the established comic rhythm but eventually wins you over. Allen displays his usual stuntcasting prowess by tossing a couple of Brits into the mix-Hugh Grant typecast as a stuffy English type and the boundlessly versatile Tracey Ullman as Woody's very New Yawkish wife. The real casting coup here was luring national comic treasure Elaine May out of the director's seat and back in front of the camera for a rare acting appearance--she still possesses the chops to crack me up with just a ""look"" or a subtle inflection. Not Classic Woody, but an encouraging  return to form and a worthwhile entertainment.",977788800,4,966,5.1923076923076925
1266513,4,B00003CXGR,"This film takes Woody Allen back to the mood of some of his earliest works, when he was more visceral than cerebral.  It is an amusing rags-to-riches-to-rags story that carries with it the subtle message that the acquisition of wealth doesn't automatically confer class and that class isn't necessarily desirable anyway.
Allen sticks to slapstick themes in this story about a hapless couple that accidentally creates a mega-corporation out of a cookie store that is intended to be a front for a bank robbery.  Ray Winkler is a small time crook who rents the store because it is two doors down from the bank.  He intends to tunnel under the store and emerge in the bank vault while his wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman) bakes cookies in the store above to avert suspicion.  Of course, the heist is botched, but the cookie store has lines around the block and goes national.
With one outrageous skit after another, Allen examines the difference between class and wealth, as Ray and Frenchy try to fit into high society.  Ultimately, success becomes the Winkler's worst enemy as money buys them only misery.
Allen applies his trademark manic-depressive portrayal this time to a crook that has big ideas ricocheting around a very empty skull.  Allen has perfected the tortured-soul routine, which I suspect is a persona not very far its performer's true self.  Tracey Ullman delivers an outstanding performance as Frenchy, trying desperately to pull off a societal con and remake herself into a modern Pygmalion.  Ullman offers a great portrayal of a woman who is street smart but nave about aristocratic ways.  She handles the emotional conflict superbly as she spurns Ray for not wanting to become what Frenchy herself, despite all her efforts, can never be.  Elaine May is also priceless as Frenchy's vacuous sister whose mindless chatter is often filled with pointed insight.
There is much to enjoy about this straightforward comedy about simple people in extraordinary circumstances.  It is slapstick with a message, which makes it both funny and mentally appealing.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is light fare, but very entertaining.",977616000,2,2124,5.017094017094017
1266514,5,B00003CXGR,"SMALL TIME CROOKS is another four or four and a half film that I was lenient on and gave it a five.  It is an entertaining and extremely satisfying comedy that I love because of it's small, but unusually captivating ironic twist.  Tracy Ullman plays Frenchie, the wife of Woody Allen who is planning a bank robbery with friends by tunneling up to the bank in the basement of a ex-pizza hut.  As a cover, Ullman takes up a cookie baking business up in the front.  While the bank robbery plot is getting more and more complicated, Frenchie's business begins to grow... It is a funny movie with some hilarious lines and scenes like the fake news documentary on ""Sunset"", the company name.  It is funny, involving, and the characters are, if not well-""developed"", well-""characterized"".

1266516,3,B00003CXGR,"A beautifully made (if slight) film, although the script is not up to Allens's normal standard.  His devotees will search the script in vain for references to Bergman, Scott Fitzgerald or Strindberg.  This is aimed at a much more middlebrow audience.
Having said all that I never really laughed at films like Take The Money & Run, while I did at certain sequences in this.
The first third concerning the abortive robbery is only sporadically amusing, while the remainder, when the nouveaux riches Allen and Ullman attempt to enter 'society' has some genuinely funny moments.  These are usually triggered by an absurd situation or visual gag (often Allen's lurid costumes) rather than the script itself.
There are a couple of good set pieces: a TV 'infomercial' (realistically shot on videotape) in which Allen and the gang describe the working of the cookie company and their crass new found wealth to a bemused TV journalist, and a black tie party hosted by Allen and Ullman in their garish apartment.
A very nebulous film which runs out of steam in the final stretch, but definitely worth seeing.  Excellent picture quality on DVD, and fine (mono) sound.  Nice music as well.",977270400,,1177,4.924242424242424
1266517,4,B00003CXGR,"This is actually a great comedy of woody allen. I must confess I'm a fan of his movies, but I assure this is one you should not miss.
Woody plays an ex-con who decides to rob a bank. He tries to convince his wife, a manicurist, to spend their money buying an old street shop, so that he and his friends could dig a tunnel, which would supposedly lead them to a bank safety. In order to make it not suspicious, he asks her to sell cookies during the day. However, the cookies shop becomes very popular in the neighborhood and woody and his wife suddenly become noveau rich.
One year later, they are living a new life style, rounded by intelectuals, artists and socialites. In an effort to acquire some culture, the couple hires Hugh Grant to teach them good social manners, and this is the moment the film becomes hilarious. Woody was perfect, as always, playing a rude guy who'd rather watch TV eating chips than going to operas and museums. Besides woody, it's worth watching Elaine May, who plays a clueless cousin of woody's wife.
I also recommend you pay attention to woody's house decoration. In the living room, he had tigers, ancient objects and even an harp! Totally awesome!

This film returns to the earlier days of Allen with its punchy writing and even punchier acting, especially by Tracey Ullman who feigns a materialistic housewife of an ex-con very well.
