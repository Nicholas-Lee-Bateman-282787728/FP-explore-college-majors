8322620,4,6305845379,"Deadlock is the sort of cross-genre film that distrubutors don't quite know how to sell,  so it's marketed as an Amtyville type horror film, when it's really closer in spirit to the Evil Dead series - an indie horror comedy that makes up for it's lack of a budget with lots of wit and inventiveness (and maybe a gallon of blood and five gallons of radioactive-looking blue face paint). It ain't high art, but it has tons of style. Definite party fare - especially in late October.",1110499200,,480,4.517241379310345
8322621,3,6305845379,"This refreshing spoof of the horror genre starts from a clever premise -- an out-of-work soap actor inherits his dead brother's house, and the things that were haunting his brother -- and takes it in surprising directions.  Fun characters -- especially the neighbors that are only slightly crazier  than real-life neighbors -- and a dead-on send-up of Hollywood's ghouls.  Low-budget indie manages to do some clever effects on no money (a  ""making-of"" docu shows how).  I've seen it twice with different  groups of friends, and laughed out loud both times.",961718400,3,556,5.122222222222222
