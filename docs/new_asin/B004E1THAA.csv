4335784,5,B004E1THAA,"This ranks in my top 5 favorite movies.  I watch it and then try to find a bigger screen to watch it on.  Then watch it again to repeat the process.  What really makes this movie, is that it does not hold back.  This is war.  It is brutal.  You can almost see the rounds flying across the screen.  It is not Hollywood where they fire a mortar and there is an explosion somewhere else.  Here they fire a mortar, you see it travel, then hit and explode.  The guns sound like the firearm it was shot from.  It is worth watching.  I paid $19.99 for it and not disappointed by any means.  The draw backs are: on a computer I had no trouble but on a DVD player it locks up in the opening and keeps wanting to go back to the previews.  You also have to set up for English captions.

4335795,5,B004E1THAA,"I'm not usually a fan of war movies, but I love this one. Based on the true story of the pivotal battle of the Nakdong River in the Korean War, it focuses on the student fighters in that battle and the role they played. Looking at a map, noting where the Nakdong River is relative to Pusan (Busan), it becomes evident how utterly crucial this battle was.
The movie was made as part of the 60th anniversary commemorations of the Korean War and meant capturing the story for its Korean audience, as very few who could tell the story were still alive to do so.
For Western audiences, this movie offers a Korean perspective of the war, one unfamiliar to most of us. From the very beginning, where the sounds of battle are disorienting for the audience, it is clear that the story will be approached differently from what we, as Western viewers, might expect.
For me, the storytelling approach spends the first 1/4 of the film, perhaps, packing a snowball, a snowball that  begins to roll--picking up more snow and a lot of speed--until suddenly it rolls off the cliff. I was exhausted after watching this film, and starting crying with about 1/3 to go all the way to the end.

People must realize it is a movie and it is not going to be 100% historically accurate.  I personally was picking out equipment inaccuracies in the movie, like using M-4 Shermans and M-48 Pattons for T-34s.  I also saw a couple rubber M-1 Garands get into the scene that should have been in the background, minor issue that most would not catch.  I thought the acting was good and the story kept you drawn in.  This is right up there with Tae Guk Gi.  For those complaining about the blood and explosions... this is a war movie not a dramatic comedy.  The koreans always seem to budget plenty of money for blood and gore in their movies.  Definitely more realistic than what you see in most movies out of Hollywood.  If you watch the credits you see some of the interviews with the real life survivors of this battle.

4335813,3,B004E1THAA,"This review contains some limited SPOILERS.

The story described in this film really happened. On 11 August 1950, during the battle of P'ohang-dong (part of the crucially important campaign of defense of Pusan perimeter), a group of 71 South Korean hastily conscripted teenagers fought an 11 hours battle against the attacking North Korean 766th Independent Regiment of Infantry (in fact a reinforced batallion of light infantry).

The South Koreans made their stand in and around the building of a high-school for girls (civilians were previously evacuated). The position they were holding protected the flank of South Korean main force, which was at that moment already heavily pressed by the main North Korean attack and awaited reinforcements to counter-attack (they ultimately arrived at the end of the day). The defenders had for all weapons their rifles (semi-automatic M1Garands), hand greandes and Molotov cocktaisl, with one 60 mm light mortar as their only support weapon. North Koreans were lightly armed and poorly equipped to attack even an improvised position (no artillery, no air support, no mortars, no flame throwers) but were much, much more numerous (maybe as much as 800) and many of them had fully automatic weapons (PPSh-41 sub-macine guns) and they carried also some Degtyaryev DP light machine guns.

After the failure of the first attack North Korean commander committed a platoon of BA-64 light armoured cars. When the second attack failed even worse, North Koreans engaged finally also a couple of T-34/85 tanks. At the end of the fighting 48 young South Korean students were laying dead. North Koreans however suffered much heavier losses and even more critically, they lost the one thing that can NEVER be recovered - crucial time...

Now, this film was supposed to pay respect to those brave students, who certainly desserved to be remembered, as they risked (and for many gave) their life for their country at an age when boys should be learning, playing football and falling for the first time in love, and not waging war (most of them were no older than 15...). But, at least for my personnal taste, it did not fully succeed.

The film contains lots of action and is filled with explosions (although most of them are clearly exploding bottles of gasoline, rather than real explosives), sprinkling blood and body parts flying in all directions, but I found many (not all) of the fighting scenes unrealistic. Especially the last attack against the school is disappointing. Some people compared this film to ""Saving Private Ryan"", but this is a complete misunderstanding - in this film people fight and die much more like in ""Missing in action"" franchise than in Steven Spielberg's masterpiece.

Characters of the students are rather poorly developped, with especially their leader being a completely wooden figure. The only people who seem really alive amongst the defenders are the three older criminals (they are 18 or 19 years old) added to the 68 students.

There is some good insight into the ideological mindframe of North Korean soldiers. The character of the North Korean regiment commander is an interesting mixture of intelligence, compassion, steel determination and - when necessary - great violence. There is however one element (sorry, SPOILER here) which is completely and totally unbelievable, as there is no way that any commander in a communist army treats his political officer with such contempt and brutality - at least not if he wants to live... Sadly, towards the end the North Korean commander is suddenly reduced to a ""standard issue"" villain, straight from a comic-book for teenagers.

So although there are some good things in this film, I can not give it more than three stars. It is less good than ""Botherhood of war"" and many levels below the extraordinary ""The Frontline"". I do not regret that I bought it and watched it, but I am not going to keep the DVD.",1355443200,5,3921,5.0588235294117645

Being so in love with Asian culture, I was always so disappointed to see poorly represented nationalities in movies about the Korean and Vietnam wars. Not to mention the ""Japanese"" potrayed in WW2 movies. I was really excited when I heard about 71 Into the Fire because it was a true story from the South Korean perspective and made in and by South Korea. Plus it has TOP. :) So, I had high expectations for it and I was not disappointed at all. It was beautifully made, heartwrenching, and the special effects were to die for! (I'm a nerd, sue me!) I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of war movies, Korea, TOP, and tear-jerking storylines. I literally wept on my best friend's shoulder.

4335817,5,B004E1THAA,"I'm a big fan of T.O.P (Choi Seung Hyun) and his performance was honestly really great, especially for someone who had only been cast in relatively small television parts and music videos previous to this.
That being said, the film has elements that make it feel very much like an instant classic, but it is not without flaws in its execution.  For example, Cha Seung Won's character is a little too evil and a little too stoic, to the point of feeling a little bit 2-D.
As a whole, however, the story is extremely entertaining and emotionally resonant.  It absolutely feels like a blockbuster as opposed to something more artsy or gritty but is there really so much wrong with that?
I am not one to watch a war movie once, let alone re-watch it repeatedly, but I can do that with 71: Into the Fire.",1327449600,4,799,4.465753424657534

4335819,4,B004E1THAA,Good acting!  Confusion in the action sequences but that was the point.  Since this movie was based on a true event; it is heart-rendering.,1309737600,2,139,4.75
4335820,3,B004E1THAA,"The Korean War was one of the bitterest conflicts in history, but being sandwiched between the Second World War and the Vietnam War, is little more than a Forgotten War in the minds of many.  The stalemate between the Communist forces and the United Nations marked the start of the Cold War.  The early days of the Korean War were the most desperate as the American forces had yet to arrive in any substantial numbers, leaving South Koreans to bear the brunt of the fighting.  To fill in the gaps in the military forces facing the North Korean onslaught as they marched down the peninsula towards the Pusan Perimeter, large numbers of high school and university students formed volunteer units to assist the South Korean soldiers in defending their country. The basis of ""71: Into the Fire"" is the battle efforts of those students at a place called Pohang.  Sadly, despite high production values, the failings of the plot and characterization don't do the basic premise of the story justice, and instead is a load of cliches and unbelievable action sequences.

After an initial opening sequence in which we are introduced to the shell-shocked leader of the students (played by Choi Seung-hyeon), the ranks of the student soldiers are found to be a mixture of juvenile delinquents, the leader of which immediately and predictably starts to undermine Choi's leadership, and the usual suspects - nerds, siblings and wannabe comedians.  Initially a disparate bunch of individuals, charged with protecting a school, the student soldiers predictably bond under fire as the school comes under siege from the North Koreans.

""71: Into the Fire"" really does come into its own during the battle sequences.  The special effects are topnotch, just as good as one would see in Hollywood blockbusters, and clearly no effort has been spared in re-enacting the intensity of warfare.  Still, it was necessary to have to put one's brain in neutral during the extended battle sequence as the North Koreans attack the school in which the student soldiers have holed up.  The plot makes great play of the fact that the North Korea soldiers are ""Shock Troops"", making their way to Pohang.  Presumably these soldiers are highly trained and experienced fighting men, befitting their leader (played by Cha Seung-won, who was the standout actor for me, pulling off a grimy, rugged and battle experienced performance).  Yet a bunch of student soldiers, barely able to shoot straight a few days before, cuts down wave after wave of these soldiers with little effort. This is abundantly apparent in a rooftop sequence where the thought of taking cover does not appear to enter the minds of about 30 or so North Korean soldiers!

As a war film, ""71: Into the Fire"" does what is expected.  Heroism abounds, as does explosions, shell casings and tragic and gory deaths.  However, as a measured tribute to the bravery of the student soldiers, ""71: Into the Fire"" doesn't quite make the grade because of the plot and its usual clichs.

Special Features: The CineAsia two disc release of this film comes with a disc of extras, including a ""Making of"" documentary,  featurettes on pre-production and production design, audio commentary by Bey Logan and Mike Leeder (experts on Asian Cinema), deleted scenes, behind the scenes, among other bonus features.",1306800000,4,3318,4.992740471869329
4335821,5,B004E1THAA,"I was looking forward to seeing this one as I am a fan of Korean cinema. This follows in the wake of many other excellent films from South Korea telling some of the stories that came out of their still ongoing civil war.

Once again this is based on `actual events' that took place on August 11th 1950, when a group of volunteer `Student Soldiers' held back a North Korean commando brigade. They are hopelessly outnumbered being only 71 in number and hence the title of the film, but show remarkable ingenuity and tenacity. It is slightly reminiscent of the German WW 2 film 'Die Brucke' or The Bridge,The Bridge (Die Brucke) [DVD] [1959] where school children are left to defend a bridge against overwhelming odds, but this has buckets more action.

The events unfold in a mix of real time and some flash backs which help to create empathy for the main characters, who are all desperately young and most still in school uniforms.

The action scenes are regular and bloody, they have built on the incredible realism that we saw in films like `Brotherhood',Brotherhood [DVD] [2004]and the excellent 'Assembly'Assembly [2007] [DVD] and first came to the fore in the West with `Saving Private Ryan'. Like those films, this is in Korean with English sub titles. I do not want to give away any plot spoilers as this is a rollicking rollercoaster from start to finish, during the more contemplative moments I was actually glad for a breather, such is the intensity of this film. It is 116 minutes long, which seems like a long film, but the time just flew past and there is so much action in it I feel I will have to view this again to be sure I did not miss too much. There are some plot holes and quite clearly this is `based' on actual events, all of that aside this is one of the best films I have seen in ages.",1302566400,26,1809,4.492401215805471

Since it is a historical movie, from the start you know they all are going to die. The movie is going to be how they died well.

It is an action movie, overall the acting and character development was good. I particularly liked the scene when a sniper takes out one guy and the rookie soldiers chased him. Often you learn much by seeing how wrong people who do not know what they are doing behave.

Some of the scenes are very strong. I did like Cha Seung-Won performance, although I am not sure how realistic his behavior is of a North Korean commander.

So I was quite excited when I knew that the film 71-Into the Fire was being released.

But the film has caused me some disappointment. Production value is high and the open scene is very strong but it isn't a serious war movie but rather an action flick with all the extras and as such does not satisfy my taste. Since it is based on true events I would have much prefered they stick to those rather than make it into some sort of Hong Kong-ish action film. Whatever is added to the story is what made it fail to be something special.

4335825,4,B004E1THAA,"Set in 1950, a Korean war movie ""71: Into the Fire"" is based on the battle account during the Korean War and the seventy-one students who volunteered to fight as a soldier.

Overwhelmed by the fierce attacks from the North Korean forces, the South Korean forces decide to transfer all the regular armies to P'ohang-dong, the last line of defense for South Korean and UN forces. This means seventy-one inexperienced student soldiers have to defend the city of Pohang alone, while outnumbered by the North Korea's well-trained troops led by battle-hardened Commander Park Mu-Rang (Cha Seung-Won).

Unlike ""300"" and ""The Alamo,"" all the soldiers are teenagers (or younger). Among them are Oh Jang-bom (Choi Seung-hyeon, T.O.P of the band Big Bang), survivor of the previous battle. The quiet student is made a makeshift captain of the young soldiers with no practical experience of war, including Kap-jo (Sang-woo Kwone), a ""juvenile delinquent,"" whose real purpose of joining the army is revenge for the deaths of his parents.

First I must say ""71: Into the Fire"" is not free from war movie conventions. Actually, it is full of them, making some of the scenes (including the two big combat sequences) borderline clich. Except for some (misguided, I think) attempt at comedy, however, the film works surprisingly well, with very good acting from the leads and the well-executed stunts. Some of the characters are just stock types, and some episodes are too good to be true, but John H. Lee, better known for his love stories like ""A Moment to Remember,"" knows exactly how to keep us interested in the characters and their fates with slick storytelling.

""71: Into the Fire"" may not break any new ground, but the film remains absorbing throughout.",1298160000,2,1744,5.003448275862069

8426396,5,B004E1THAA,"This is one slam dunk war film!  It's about a group of South Korean students who are soldiers, who are left to defend the town by a girls school.  They have to deal with their own insecurities and fears while still learning combat tactics.  Plus a huge army of communist regulars are advancing on the town to ""take no prisoners."" The acting is good and the battle scenes are outstanding.  The film is in Korean language but does have English subtitles.  Funny cause it must have been censored, cause they translate ""Son of a Witch"" and ""DARN"" instead of the curse words.  I enjoyed the film and did get involved because it was based on an actual  real incident.",1494720000,2,661,4.504201680672269

It's also based on true facts about the war between north and South Korea . Yes it has subtitles , but in my opinion again , you get the real effects from the movie . No over dubbing from an American actor trying to make a silly voiceover . Very good movie , I highly recommend it .",1485561600,,399,3.7058823529411766
