2828801,4,B000PY52FY,"If you want to know more about Nikola Tesla, this movie helps to get an insight into what made the man tick. Though the movie itself is rather theatrical and old fashioned (probably should have a ""remake"" made of it)However it did help to know the man and his life a bit better.",1294444800,4,278,4.264150943396227
2828802,5,B000PY52FY,"I first learned about Tesla about 3 years ago, when I saw an episode of Modern Marvels, on the History Channel, titled ""Mad Electricity.""  By the end of the show I was totally amazed, and almost like in trance.  I thought to myself, ""How could I not have known anything about this brilliant man before now.""  I thought it was just me, but I proceeded to find out that most people have no idea about Tesla.  I've exposed myself to additional information on Tesla since then, and most recently saw this movie.  I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone.  Don't expect a finely polished presentation, but expect a nice summary of his life experience and contributions to the world we live in, presented in a real movie format.",1285459200,8,735,4.572519083969466
2828803,5,B000PY52FY,"I wanted to watch this movie because I had heard about Tesla in the movie ""The Prestige"". I didn't know anything about him until then. I wanted my own copy of this story of Tesla's life because he was very important, though, I think overlooked in history. Thomas Edison was Tesla's rival and J.P. Morgan financed Tesla's work. However, Morgan backed away from supporting Tesla and thus, Tesla's work did not get completed as it should have. I believe this movie is important to enlighten people to who Tesla was and what a shame it was and is that he didn't get to finish the work he started.",1251590400,20,592,4.4907407407407405
2828804,5,B000PY52FY,"This is a great movie which leads me to ask, why didn't I see it sooner. Great cast of stars support what is a detailed introspective movie on the life of one of histories greatest scientific minds. Apparently this is a digitally restored version of the film. All I can say is the quality of the film is pristine. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment and the film left me wanting to learn more about this fantastic genius Nikola Tesla. Orson Welles plays Industrialist J.P. Morgan with great skill as do all of the stars who represent key figures in history around the time of Tesla's life as portrayed in this film. The actor that plays the part of Nikola Tesla is perfect in his role. A true tour de force and a must see movie for all Truth-seekers to see.",1242518400,7,755,4.4
2828805,5,B000PY52FY,All I can say is that this film mesmerized me not because it is the most polished motion picture film I have ever seen because it is not.  What comes through is the absolute marvel of Tesla's inventive mind.  This film has done well to possibly give me a lifelong interest in Tesla and leaves me wanting to read and find out so much more.  The fact that there are some Hollywood lengends acting in this film makes it all the more curious and desireable to see.  If Tesla interests you at all this is a must see film.,1235433600,37,516,4.181818181818182
2828806,5,B000PY52FY,"This DVD gives the viewer a great insight into Tesla, what his life was like and the many closed minds, greed, deception and discouragement he dealt with in his efforts to conduct his research and bring his powerful discoveries to the world.",1215820800,26,241,4.761904761904762
2828807,1,B000PY52FY,"This DVD was I think the worst grade B movie ever made.  It actually seems like it was patched together from other very poorly rated B movies which made it a poor history of the Genius Inventor Nikola Tessla.

I hope someday someone does a lot more research and puts together a movie on this man.  Especially his participation in the Philadelphia Experiment and his relationship with Albert Einstein.",1213488000,13,400,4.768115942028985

It's a great movie and the dvd is acceptable quality, better than anything you'll find for this movie. The case isn't a box like cardboard case like the one displayed but it's still decent quality.",1406851200,,381,4.457142857142857
2828815,5,B000PY52FY,very interesting...and educational. We've stayed in the room at the New Yorker where he spent the last 10 years if his life...the electrical outlet didn't work!!!!!,1405900800,,164,5.346153846153846
2828816,1,B000PY52FY,This was a scam.  It was film footage of some guy in his basement with poster boards talking about Tesla.  Very creepy thing.  We returned it immediately.,1394496000,,154,4.62962962962963

2828818,1,B000PY52FY,"Just a lot of crap. you could go to youtube and get more information. i was disappointed. watched it once and feel i was very ripped off. don't waste your money and on top of that, there are so many stories about Tesla, one does not know which ones to believe!",1385164800,,260,4.117647058823529

2828820,3,B000PY52FY,"Nikola and a remarkable person.  A great story.  For the content, its too bad there isn't a good quality movie about the life of this remarkable man and his achievements and contribution to the world.  What a shame so many take credit for his contribution.  He is truly the father of electricity.",1379289600,,296,4.634615384615385
2828821,5,B000PY52FY,"While not your Hollywood big budget movie, the film does succeed in delivering the life of Tesla.  His naive coming to America, meeting influential people, they're all here.  While the film is a bit crude, it still documents Tesla's spirit if naive personality in the front of megabillionaires wanting to exploit his knowledge.  All ages recommended.",1375401600,,350,5.214285714285714
2828822,5,B000PY52FY,I never heard of Nikola Tesla when I was  in school.  I hope they are teaching true history of electricity now in the schools.,1370044800,,126,4.208333333333333
2828823,5,B000PY52FY,Any information regarding Tesla is a good thing. Compared to written information this move as do so many documentaries slops many details. For all I have read this is an addition of information as well as some details I was unaware of like his family ties and some emotional ties. The movie is not entertaining and even tedious at times. If you have some knowledge of Tesla you will enjoy this beyond its failings. If you are looking to be entertained you will find this a failure. I still enjoyed it and find its Euro cinema approach refreshing nevertheless.,1366588800,,559,4.656565656565657
2828824,3,B000PY52FY,"Great history and life story of Nikola Tesla. Played by real actors and only narrated partially, it tells the true story about the genius Mr Tesla was and how his invention of AC power can be found everywhere today. More people like him exist today who understand free energy; pass this along to them for inspiration!",1354492800,,317,4.678571428571429
2828825,3,B000PY52FY,"This is a great movie for Tesla completists, an interesting movie for fans of esoterica and obscure cult cinema, and a terrible movie for fans of serious film. I came to it as a fan of Nikola Tesla, and although the  movie is flawed, it does still hold a certain naive charm. The main problem with the movie is the direction and dialogue. There's some great acting, with Orson Welles stealing the show and taking no prisoners in his sterling portrayal of industrialist J P Morgan. Lead actor Petar Bozovic puts in a respectable performance and accurate physical portrayal of Nikola Tesla as the quiet misunderstood genius, that at times unintentionally falls into parody. This is the fault of director Kristo Papic, who seems to have instructed poor Bozovic to replicate Tesla's physicality in almost every scene from the poses in the relatively few photos of Tesla available. Indeed Papic's direction is lame throughout; witness Tesla's mother's death scene for a hearty chuckle.  Further flaws are evident in the dialogue, or lack of it sometimes, with the screenplay and narrative assuming the viewers foreknowledge of Tesla's life. Someone who wasn't already familiar with Tesla's story would be confused by the sudden flashback scenes and lack of continuity in the narrative thread of the film. It seems this movie may have only been intended for domestic (Former Yugoslavia) release only, as the script appears to have been clumsily translated from Serbo-Croatian into English, again making for unintentional laughs.  Another frustration is the lack of production date in the credits or dvd cover. I'm guessing it was made in the seventies or early eighties. On the positive side, fans of b-grade Hollywood trivia will note a great performance by supporting actor Strother Martin.

I cautiously recommend this for Tesla fans. As mentioned earlier,the film does have a naive charm, and is still worth watching for Welles' performance. A rainy day dvd. Hell it's no worse than 1970s Woody Guthrie biopic ""Bound for Glory"" starring David Carradine as Woody. So if you liked Bound, then here's an introduction to another neglected hero of the people, Nikola Tesla.",1352332800,7,2166,5.110169491525424
2828826,5,B000PY52FY,"This movie should be required viewing by all citizens of the USA to show how a great genius can be persecuted by the failing legal system back in 1890 as of today. We owe a huge percentage of our daily comforts, most of which are powered by AC current, as introduced for us by Tesla. Sadly, very few educated folks in the USA have any clue about how much of our lifestyle is based on Tesla's work. The movie is very close to the actual history but can, of course, only scratch the surface on the overall contribution by Tesla. You owe it to yourself to see this to be an educated person.",1337040000,,587,4.20353982300885
2828827,5,B000PY52FY,"After putting off watching this film I finally sat down and watched it.  What a marvelous movie! I learned a lot about Mr. Nikola Teslas. Plus the superb acting from Orson Welles as JP Morgan, the beautiful Oja Kodar as Katharine Johnson and of course Petar Bozovi' as Nikola Tesla.  The movie gave me a glimpse of what the world was like in the late 1800's. Still quite feudal. And of the deep rift between two genius's Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla on a collision course affecting the destiny of the world for the next two centuries.  I felt deep empathy for the plight of Mr. Tesla.  His eccentricities and sometimes strange mannerisms. He was sensitive. He believed in communicating with the dead and with martians. Through it all glimmered the powerful light of his intellect. Such strange and sometimes frightening visions he entertained.  Voice and pictures that travel through the air.  Electricity without wires.  Death Ray guns for war.  Nikola was not given to idle speculation.  Once he pitched something he usually already had a smaller proof of concept model of whatever invention he had in mind to display to his sponsers. The movie is slightly quirky given to not so subtle flashbacks by director Krsto Papi'. But it gets the job done. And eventually one settles down to just enjoy the movie.",1323475200,2,1309,4.808035714285714
