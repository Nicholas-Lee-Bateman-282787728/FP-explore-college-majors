8253059,5,B0013UMHM0,"This charming 1957 film by the most fruitful Italian director Alberto Lattuada stars Jacqueline Sassard as the young girl Guendalina, with Raffaele Mattioli as her youthful lover Oberdan.  Wonderful performances in this Italian language film of young love from Sassard, Sylva Koscina and Raf Vallone, with an especially affecting characterization from young actor Mattioli... in real life an engineering student who took on a few film roles during school recesses to pay for his studies, and who died tragically of a heart attack at age 23 in 1960.

Apparently currently available only in a PAL DVD Italian language edition, this is still a not-to-be missed film essay.  Even the tough critic Pauline Kael, in a review she wrote in the 1960s for the old Telegraph Cinema Theatre in Berkeley, Calif., lauded this film then as (perhaps paraphrasing her) ""... a wonderful film of youth and love"", which it most certainly is.

The only unsatisfaction is as follows:  when I received this DVD, the case was slightly broken. though DVD itself was not damaged.",1374364800,,234,4.2
