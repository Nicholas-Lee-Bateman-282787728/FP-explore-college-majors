6248258,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"The Met's belated foray into the complete Donizetti ""Tudor trilogy"" began inauspiciously in 2011 with a season-opening David McVicar production of ANNA BOLENA showcasing Anna Netrebko. Hobbled out of the gate by the pregnancy-necessitated withdrawal of mezzo Elna Garana (whose Jane Seymour had been the best thing about a recent-past production from Vienna, now on DVD), it was further undermined by an Anna whose temperament only partially compensated for a smudgy florid technique and a big lyric rather than truly dramatic voice, hoarsening toward the end of the work's two long acts. The director, too, was largely unsuccessful in his attempts to make a long and oft-static work dynamic, and costume and set designs were notably dreary. The prospect of a new MARIA STUARDA the following season helmed by the same director did not inspire great enthusiasm, but this was as much a hit as the BOLENA had been a miss, and a standout of the 2012-13 season.

Joyce DiDonato at the time of this writing is the sort of singer one is encouraged to see and hear in anything. She chooses her assignments wisely; she seems incapable of giving a performance that is less than meticulously and intelligently prepared; she has a brilliant technical facility, and she has an appealing and ingratiating personality that she takes with her on the stage, whether she is Cenerentola, the Composer, Sycorax, or Maria Stuarda. There were some complaints when it was announced that the music here was lowered slightly to accommodate a mezzo-soprano heroine, but most listeners will not be following with a score, and I cannot imagine that Donizetti (who lived in a time when composers countenanced far greater liberties) would have been anything other than thrilled with her assumption. To hear DiDonato confront this music with her awesome technical arsenal is to understand why bel canto is still worth performing and hearing. One becomes aware that everything Donizetti wrote is there for an expressive purpose, not only for pretty display -- that a trill can mean anxiety or excitement, that a grand scalar flourish can mean pride and haughtiness. DiDonato cheats nothing in this fearless, generous, all-encompassing performance. Perhaps her fundamentally sunny-American presence militates slightly against one's acceptance of her as a beleaguered woman from a long-distant era, but she is immensely likable and sympathetic, giving a performance of great feeling. My only serious complaint is one that should be laid on the director rather than the singer: The historical Mary Stuart was executed at 44, but McVicar plays up the heroine's encroaching age and frailty, saddling his star for the opera's second half with what looks like a Parkinsonian tremor. DiDonato could have played the passage of time and Maria's diminished circumstances as poignantly with less of a clinical demonstration, and at times one sympathizes with her need to carry out this stagy shuddering and rocking while meeting her considerable musical responsibilities. But she does it.

South African soprano Elza van den Heever made a memorable Met debut as Maria's rival and captor, Elisabetta (Queen Elizabeth I). The basic vocal material may not be called lovely, but she uses it with shrewdness, force, and technical security, as a component of a well-worked-out performance. Van den Heever is a tall and commanding figure on the stage, and she spoke of having studied the films of Bette Davis and working what she saw into this queen -- butch and swaggering but with occasional flashes of saucy humor (mostly in her opening scene set in the Globe Theater, which features amusing byplay with performing clowns). But Elisabetta too is ultimately diminished by age, and Van den Heever effectively (and affectingly) makes the weight of the queen's responsibilities, not to mention the weight of her costumes, tell. Behind the elaborate painting and rouging, the ostentatious gowns, this is an insecure, suffering, very lonely woman. The historically dubious confrontation between Elisabetta and Maria crackles with electricity, a tribute to both singers and director.

This is decidedly not a men's opera from the standpoint of the singers, but Met tenor favorite Matthew Polenzani, who can be a phlegmatic performer, is unusually incisive and engaged as Roberto, phrasing beautifully as the man coveted by the rival queens, and Matthew Rose brings warmth and gravity to his small role as the clemency-encouraging Talbot. Joshua Hopkins is less convincing as his antipode, the bloodthirsty Cecil, but it is an even smaller, one-note role. The reliably wonderful Maria Zifchak adds another to her gallery of Met comprimaria roles as the loyal Hannah.

The stage production features much of David McVicar's best Met work, alertly directed with great care for details of personality,  beautifully designed and costumed, and with a knockout of a final stage picture (Maria mounting the steps, at the top of which the  executioner looms). Conductor Maurizio Benini accompanies with style and flexibility; both chorus and orchestra sound as though their experience in this score extends considerably beyond five prior performances of it (this high-definition broadcast was the sixth of a run of eight).

Expectations, then, are reset for the trilogy's conclusion with ROBERTO DEVEREUX. In the meantime, this outstanding performance gets an unambiguous recommendation.",1395619200,42,5422,5.312354312354312
6248259,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"This presentation of Donizetti's dramatic opera about real events in Tudor history succeeds in all areas. McVicar's inventive but restrained staging with  lovely costumes doesn't intrude on the wonderful singing. All of the soloists are excellent, Van der Hever sounds a bit brittle in places, but it could be that this is intentional to display the mental state of Elizabeth. Joyce DiDonato is simply outstanding in the last act as she prepares for her death with courage and humility. For once the chorus gets a starring role and complements DiDonato perfectly. This release should help bring Maria Stuarda into the main repertory where it deserves to be with Elisir and Lucia and Don Pasquale.",1395446400,23,696,5.105263157894737

6248265,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"Joyce Didonato, Matthew Polenzani and Elza Van Den Heever all on the same stage in stylized period costumes singing bel canto? Need I say more? I was transported and have watched this video more times than I can count. I don't want to give short shrift to Matthew Rose and Joshua Hopkins. Theirs were also stellar performances that should not be discounted. The ""confession"" scene between Rose and Didonato was particularly moving. Didonato delivered a poignant, thoroughly moving Mary full of regret to Talbot's (Rose) sympathetic forgiveness and understanding. Rose's final notes in that scene are so pure and resonant in his deep, deep base, they will make the listener weep. With all that said, the confrontation between Mary and Elizabeth is what most lovers of this opera will want to see. They will not be disappointed. Having seen other renditions of this scene, including Montserrat Caballe's, I have to say that Van Den Heever and DiDonato win the prize. Van den Heever sweeps around the stage in a crimson, open farthingale that was hard to take one's eyes off of while Didonata sings literally from bended knee and never misses a note or a corresponding facial expression. Overall, these were not just musical performances, they were also acting roles at their finest.",1436313600,3,1280,5.014084507042254
6248266,4,B00I3LDEFQ,"An excellent performance of one of Donizetti's greats. Standouts among the singers are Sonia Ganassi (as Queen Elizabeth I, but looking eerily like Bernadette Peters) and especially a young Joseph Calleja as Leicester, who's hard to recognize clean-shaven and in a black wig, until he opens his mouth and that golden sound comes pouring out. The production is traditional and low-budget, and the acting leaves much to be desired, but bel canto isn't really about those things. The filming could have been clearer and sharper.",1432166400,,525,5.188235294117647

6248274,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"There are several Maria Stuardas in the DVD catalog, dating back to the 1980s film using the voices of Dame Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti, This is the winner by several lengths. It is superbly cast and sung, with all singers doing first rate jobs both musically and dramatically. It was originally a Metropolitan Opera HD simulcast in 2012, following the Met's excellent Anna Bolena with Anna Netrebko and its release was eagerly awaited here.

The plot is not even a loose adaption from the historical situation involving Elizabeth I and Mary Tudor, and while the meeting between the two never occurred in the real world, the dynamic tension wrought by Donizetti and his librettist in the meeting scene is almost hair rising when done right. And it is.

I cannot say anything about Joyce DiDonato that has not already been said by more talented writers than I. One review of her performance in the ROH's La Donna del Lago referred to her voice as ""sunshine pouring from her mouth"", The voice possesses warmth,  an extended range and technique which permits both full forte and exquisite pianissimi. Her ability to handle the most complex of coloratura challenges is amply documented in her many Rossini recordings and is displayed to perfection in this performance. Ms. DiDonato is also a very accomplished actress which enables her to bring life to her characters and dramatic integrity to the part.

Elza Van den Heever (Elizabeth I) was new to me but rendered a compelling characterization of Elizabeth, including a swaggering portrayal of the young queen in Act I that I associate with Tudor England. In this, she displayed a promising stage presence, with a bit of steeliness in the voice that was perfect for her role, but which would benefit from some smoothing out if it represents her normal voice production.

I like Matthew Polenzani; we have several videos of his work, going back to the Magic Flute. His top is not as extended as some of his contemporaries, but he has a lovely musicality and an exceptionally smooth passagio. Dramatically he is spot on as the Earl of Leicester, frustrated in being unable to save his beloved Mary from the block.

The Met's orchestra and chorus (arguably the best in the world at present) under Maestro Maurizio Benini is superb.

This was the Met's first production of Maria Stuarda; strange to say, the opera's secure place in the repertory is of recent occurrence. The 19th Century saw a handful of performances due to censorship which did not permit the folks seeing royalty killing each other off or otherwise behaving badly. Fortunately for modern audiences, the opera is widely performed and recorded, with at least six versions on video, all of which are varying degrees of very good. Recognition, I suspect, of the work's recognized worth.

Disc quality is excellent, but a modern public might have supported a Blu ray edition, with its superior picture and sound. But the quality of this performance, gentle reader, demands the five stars I gave it (and many other reviewers as well)

Not to be missed!",1417478400,,3069,4.909266409266409
6248275,5,B00I3LDEFQ,One of the most powerful performances I have seen.,1416096000,,50,4.666666666666667
6248276,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"Joyce DiDonato did a fantastic performance, vocally and in acting. This production perhaps a little from Donizetti's idea, in that it attempts to create the history of the period. For example, you see Queen elizabeth bald, putting on her wig. The performance has good sets, which at times seem a little austere for the MET. From what I understand from the back stage information that the set mimics the Globe Theater of Shakespeare, the Elizabethan period. In this I do not see Donizetti viewpoint, but they can't resist being novel. The opening is a little ribald and unnecessary for me to like the opera. It is a great production and worth watching. Maria Stuarda is a fantastic opera, timeless. I will watch this production. There are other productions out there that are also good: the La Scala and Covent Garden with Janet Baker, sung in English. All are good in their own way.",1413417600,,882,4.771241830065359
6248277,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"I saw this magnificent production of ""Maria Stuarda"" in the Live from Met Series in 2013 and was hoping it would be released on DVD.  Joyce DiDonato was so fully in character with superlative singing throughout the entire opera and in the final scene rightly had the Met audience giving a standing ovation to an unforgettable performance.  Elza van den Heever as Elisabetta (a name new to me) was perfectly cast and also sang with conviction and possesses a voice of such quality I'm sure we'll see her again soon in another Met production.  Matthew Polenzani as Roberto Dudley was in fine voice and adapted to his role with fine singing and as always is fully immersed in any part he plays.  Maurizio Benini conducted the Met Orchestra and Chorus with It's usual high standard and the sets and costumes were set in the correct period and thankfully not modernised like with that abysmal ""La Sonnambula"" a few years back.  Buy this DVD and be sent into a world of glorious music and singing plus a first rate production by David McVicar.  BRAVO TO ALL CONCERNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1411689600,,1083,4.795698924731183

6248280,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"This got rave reviews in GRAMOPHONE, and with good reason.  The opera is a good one, and the cast is strong throughout, with Joyce di Donato doing a terrific job in the long and difficult title role.  Her South African counterpart as Queen Elizabeth is also fine, and that can be said of the entire cast.  Great stuff.",1410825600,,318,4.448275862068965
6248281,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"Excellent singing and orchestral playing. Great video and audio. The costumes and staging are a bit quirky but not enough to take away a star, strongly recommended",1409184000,,163,5.074074074074074
6248282,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"I didn't know this opera, only for references until I saw it on PBS a year ago. At that moment I found this performance and the music very well done and beautiful. When I saw that the DVD was released I bought it.
The cast was very good with very good singers and a very convincing acting.
The two main characters: Maria Stuarda and Queen Elizabeth played by Joyce Dinonato and Elza van der Heever respectively were done very successfully, they showed very strong personalities very well, for instance the encounter of both characters in the field (at the end of Act 1) that according to history never happened but for the opera is a turning point because reflects the conflict between them and defines the rest of the drama ending with the death of Maria Stuarda 10 years later.
The direction and chorus were very good as well as the costumes and scenery.",1405814400,,856,4.564935064935065
6248283,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"""Maria Stuarda"" is my favorite of the Elizabeth trilogy; and this is a magnificent interpretation of it.  Joyce Didonato is a lush and appealing Mary Stuart.  To me, however, the star in this production is the new (for me, anyway) South African soprano, Elza van den Heever as Elizabeth I.  Her acting is intense and her eyes have the power to cast Mary forever into Hell.  The Act I, Scene 2dialogue between Elizabeth and Mary (which never happened historically) is operatic drama at its finest, and these two divas do it marvelously.  Palenzani as Leicester is excellent as are all the male singers without exception.  However this is an opera which centers on two women, and they steal the show in this production.
I felt the portrayal of Elizabeth and Mary in the Act II was a bit too much.  They were portrayed as old ladies with Parkinson's Disease.  That is definitely not historical.  Be that as it may, the final scene leaves us breathless as Mary ascends the stairs for her execution.
 The Metropolitan prodocution is tops, as usual.",1403481600,,1043,4.7444444444444445
6248284,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"Other reviewers note the foibles in this production, and they are real. But there is simply no question that the Maria Stuarda realized by Joyce DiDonato for this Met production is something wonderful to hear and to behold! My first DVD was defective. It kept cutting out, and my DVD player kept announcing that it was ""skipping the damaged parts"" which turned out to be nearly every part. But I witnessed enough to know that this performance was worth paying double for, so I ordered another one from Amazon. The second DVD has so far played without incident, and I am really pleased.",1403308800,,585,4.689320388349515
6248285,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"I was beginning to give up hope that this would appear on DVD. For those of us old enough to remember the ""glory days"" of the great bel canto singers of the 50s, 60s and early 70s, and who bemoan the state of current opera singing technique, you can, no MUST buy this DVD. Joyce DiDonato's final scene contains some of the most beautiful singing I have ever heard. Such a tiny ""heroine"", with a vocal range that astounded me.  If you enjoyed ""The Enchanted Island"", this is even better. The rest of the cast is outstanding as well.",1402531200,2,531,4.363636363636363
6248286,5,B00I3LDEFQ,This is a FANTASTIC DVD opera download from the Met's 2013 season.  Joyce DiDonato carried this production over the moon.  It took forever for the NY Met to put it in production but it was well worth the wait.  Thank you one and all for this super production.

6248287,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"What can one say about perfection?  The trio of principals is fearlessly awesome.  This is finally the equal of the Caballe/Verrett recording, which I consider the best ever. I saw Sills in all three roles more than once, and have forever lamented that only her Robert Devereux survives on DVD, but now I can rest easy.  Thank God, in my senior citizen status I can still enjoy the peerless Met performances without paying through the nose or standing in line for welfare tickets. As I watched I kept thinking: ""there is Bellini and there is Rossini, but Donizetti is absolute!""",1399334400,3,578,4.76

6248289,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"Great opera is a living thing that is constantly changing and Donizetti's ""Tudor Queen Trilogy is no exception. I've seen dozens of productions over the years and have more than a dozen CDs DVDs and BRs of each one. Some of these performances were nice at the time but faded away over the years, others were quite moving but all share two moments that rivet attention; Maria's confession to Talbot, a priest, (she did know about the Babington Conspiracy) and her aria and final prayer that close the opera. These are among the most moving and convincing passages written by Donazetti in any of his works.
The opera can be done in traditional settings as the Sutherland, with Bonynge conducting (Canada National), Gnassi with Carminati conducting (Bergamo), modern, but not too modern Ganassi, with Carminati conducting (Le Fenice), English (and in English) Janet Baker, with Charles Mackerras (English National Opera). The present recording with Joyce DiDinato is the best yet of this last decade. I have rarely been so moved by any opera as by her aria-finale in this opera.
Ms. DiDonato is able to convey the hapless girl enmeshed in political upheavals and bad fate into one horrible marriage, plot, intrigue, and love affair after another but by conviction, survival skill and pride has managed to survive...until now.  Her resolute determination has carried her this far but time has run out. The willful pride that has served her this far has run up against Elizabeth, another willful Tudor woman (played beautifully and skillfully by Elza van den Heever).  She has the upper hand but fellow Tudor woman Maria cannot submit to it. Even after the ""bastarda"" insult (pure fiction) Elizabeth waits ten years and the Babington Conspiracy (historical truth) before committing Mary to death.
In the death scene, the transformation in Maria is phenomenal and Ms DiDonato is in top acting and vocal form. She faces the reality of her execution by wiping clean her peccadillos/sins in confession, losing her pride and as a human being rising above the fray. Great acting and vocal command! It's the most moving finale I've seen for this opera. She carries it all on her small, gentle, fragile frame in this excellent production. A special cheer for David McVicar designer and Maurizio Benini conductor.
The supporting cast is excellent also. Deep-voiced Mathew Rose as Talbot was  effective and moving as he tries to appease Maria's pride. The Cecil of Joshua Hopkins was a blood-thirsty defender of the Queen' honor. However I thought the Leister of Mathew Polenzani somewhat weak compared to past performances by Joseph Calleja or Jose Bros.
All in all, it's a great recording and a joy to play and play again.",1398384000,23,2709,5.0022172949002215
6248290,5,B00I3LDEFQ,"Simply magnificent!  When I read the New York Times' glowing review of this opera I have been eagerly waiting for the DVD., and it was worth it..........Tremendous sound recording and vivid clear image make this standard DVD presentation a real treat.

The director did an interesting thing by making the second act take place 10 years after the the famous confrontation scene that ends the first act.  This gives a facet to Elizabeth that is not shown when it seems the beheading happens 24 hours later as in other productions.of this opera.

The acting by Joyce DiDonato as Maria Stuarda may be the best job of physical acting I have ever seen in an opera of any type.  It along with her singing and the singing of the entire cast raise this production to a level one does not often encounter. This is bel canto opera the way it should be done!

The Backstage at the Met interviews are particularly interesting........the director goes into the decision to extend the action by 10 years.....good stuff.
