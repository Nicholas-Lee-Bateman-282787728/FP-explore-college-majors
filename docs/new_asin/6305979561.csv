Not the only showcase for the Quartet's talent, but definately a must have for any serious music collection.  Very enjoyable (even though the very end cuts off Blue Rondo A La Turk).",1353369600,,343,4.483870967741935
7899208,5,6305979561,"This is an oldie but goodie. I love it. I watch it all the time. It is quite primitive but for the longest time it was the only video of the old Brubeck Quartet that I could find. So it has grown on me. I'm a die-hard Brubeck fan so whatever, it is fine with me. This has Joe Morello and Gene Wright. I love to watch the both of them. Being an amateur drummer, I can't get enough Morello. He's amazing even under the conditions on this video. I have better videos of Brubeck these days but most times this is still my first choice. I guess I'm just nostalgic. I would still rather listen to my old Brubeck record albums with all the scratches than my new CDs. What can I say.",1269043200,,675,4.044776119402985
7899209,4,6305979561,"This edition of Jazz Casual is one of my three favorite, the others being Coltrane and Dizzy.  Although Brubeck achieved some measure of popularity with the hit, ""Take Five"" in the 60's, his innovation and creativity never faltered.
I first saw this video at a friend's house, and I found myself either staring open mouthed or laughing uncontrollably at the sheer MADNESS of Dave's playing, not to mention Desmonds.  ""Time Out"" became not only a song, but a concept.  Brubeck uses time signature like no one ever has, playing different time signatures than his rhythm section, and even playing different time signatures with his left hand than he does with his right.  It's pure brilliance.  This video is totally worth the money.",1069632000,10,730,4.950819672131147
7899210,3,6305979561,"I am a HUGE DBQ fan.  I have been to dozens of concerts, own everything they've published, even studied with Joe Morello.  The only reason you would want to buy this curious DVD is to see what they looked like in black and white in 1962 ... and remind yourself how lousy TV production was in those days.  This cheesy production used 2 cameras (4 is more typical today) on clumsy pedestals that got pushed....no, bullied... around the floor as they go from Desmond to Brubeck.  (Paul has to get out of the way on one such ""smooth"" move.)
Much of the coverage is a 3-shot, leaving out Morello, frustrating anyone who wants to see that genius.  There are a few mikes around the studio and they are often ""opened"" late, causing some of Desmond's work to be heard only from a distant mike by Dave's piano.  Blue Rondo is cut off about a minute in so the host can say goodbye.  A very rough cut brings us back to the group, only to fade out for good after the 9/8 intro settles in to the 4/4 heart of the song.  Dave's playing is brilliant and we see it for all of its glory.  But he spends far too much time TALKING instead of playing.
Joe provides a couple of good (frankly, not great -- no cross sticking, high hat or up close work that would later define his genius) 5/4 solos on Take 5 and Castilian Blues.  He uses two cymbals on stands... hadn't quite evolved to his classic set with a 20"" bass-mounted ride, 18 and 16"" crashes.  He's on a lousy riser and his set jiggles like Jell-o the whole show.
So if you want to hear great playing, this ain't it.  Want to take a bumpy ride down memory lane for about 25 min?  Then that's what you're getting.  Nothing more.",1046736000,30,1664,4.241269841269841
7899211,5,6305979561,"I'm not usually a jazz fan but this is a major exception. The musicianship is fantastic, and the tunes very compelling. I enjoyed Dave Brubeck's descriptions of the unusual time signatures. The sound quality is quite good, except for the bass which isn't loud enough. The highlights of the set for me are the 2 incredible drum solos by master drummer Joe Morello; they alone are worth the price of the video. Crank up the volume and Enjoy!",996192000,7,439,4.641025641025641
7899212,3,6305979561,"After finally purchasing a video of my favorite jazz group I was satisfied...and yet disappointed.  The group performed as well as ever but the quality of sound was so bad...but then it was forty years ago!!! Both Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond play interesting solos - Paul especially is excellent on Take Five and Dave gets in to some typical time changes in Its A Raggy Waltz. Didn't care at all for Ralph Gleason and was pleased he didn't waste any more interviewing. Poor Dave Brubeck seemed strained, or nervous, as he introduced the various pieces by the group. But I would pay the money again to watch the group that has given so many hours of pleasure over the past five decades.",985392000,12,687,4.585365853658536
