7980839,3,B000089Q8V,"I loved 'Hans Christian Andersen' starring Danny Kaye when I was a child.  When shopping for 'Hans Christian Andersen' with Danny Kaye, I saw this movie 'Hans Christian Andersen-My Life as a Fairy Tale'  I purchased them both, I want to share the story with my Grandkids.  'My Life as a Fairy Tale' runs four mins. short of three hours.  It's not interesting enough to keep young children's attention.

I was disappointed the way they chose to portray Hans Christian Anderson.  He is presented as being somewhat unbalanced mentally.  I have never researched Hans Christian Andersen as an individual.  They may be right but I hope not.  I think H. C. A. has an amazing genius for telling a great story that teaches a lesson.",1467072000,,723,4.72
