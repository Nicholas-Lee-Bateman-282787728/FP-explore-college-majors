2175565,4,B00068NVQQ,"Ever had one of those days when your mum eyes you hungrily, salivating for your torn, red flesh? Well, FLESH EATING MOTHERS is all about this phenomenon. A strange new venereal disease is being spread by a carrier-male to all of his SAHM (Stay At Home Mum) partners / victims. These women in turn, become super-strong, cannibalistic humanoids w/ insatiable appetites for various family members, friends, or anyone within biting range. I like this movie! It's obviously low budget was used well, making for a bloody good time. Yes, the acting is creaky, the dialogue is silly, and the story is ridiculous. However, you can tell that everyone involved was just playing along and having fun with it. There's plenty of crimson sauce and meaty tidbits for the true connoisseur of carnage as well. Enjoy, and don't forget to floss...",1217376000,7,827,4.914285714285715

2175567,4,B00068NVQQ,"This is definitely more of a comedy than a horror, and definitely an overlooked classic in the low-budget b-movie cheezy horror flick genre.  The story revolves around a group of mothers that turn into cannibals due to a virus caused by adultery. The only ones that assemble to stop them are the teenage children of the mothers, along with help from a goofball doctor. Some classic parts of this movie include when the virus is isolated and they get to view it through the microscope  and it is a cartoon, a part where one mother keeps making her son stay in his room, feeding him lots of milk, as if to make him like veal, a part when the one girl yells at her mom for eating her boyfriend, saying something like ""thanks alot mom, that was my date to the prom!"" and of course the best line of the movie, ""i came home and i saw my mom, eating my baby brother!"" when delivered, the actress can barely keep from bursting into laughter.  There is of course plenty of gore, blood splatter and flesh ripping, the mothers get creepy faces when they turn into cannibal mode.  Very odd concept for a film that is more unsettling then actually scary.",1074384000,4,1141,4.419047619047619
2175568,4,B00068NVQQ,"As a lover of humourously awful horror films, I have to rate this as one of the best. The women of a small town catch a disease that turns them into unstoppable monsters, hungry for human flesh. Their smarmy teenagers band together in a quest to stop the carnivorous bloodbath. Complete with everything one expects from a low budget horror flick, including claymation special effects, gallons of fake blood and, of course, corny dialogue (after his mother tries to take a bite out of his head, one teenager pushes her away and angrily announces, ""That does it! I'm running away for real this time!"")
If you have a passion for campy, b-grade horror films, this one is a must!",1037664000,6,674,4.6722689075630255
2175569,4,B00068NVQQ,"This way rare horror flick is a must have!!!
An independent film about a virus that infects a city of mothers and transforms them into flesh eating canibals.  A few teenagers are the only ones who can stop the virus from spreading.
This movie is quite low budget, but very cool.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves low budget, corny horror flicks.",1020470400,3,355,4.53125

8040264,2,B00068NVQQ,"The film has a clever idea. An STD is transmitted from Roddy  Douglas (Louis Homyak) to all of his conquests. The virus turns women who have had children in flesh eaters including super human strength and zombie teeth.

The film had Troma style body parts and blood squirts, but lacked the character and dialogue to be a cult classic.

Okay as a rental. ""Breathless"" is a superior film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No nudity. Adult themes.",1409097600,,436,4.773333333333333
8040265,5,B00068NVQQ,"Fantastically hilarious cheesy horror comedy fun! Mothers go crazy and eat people... says it in the title, and boy it delivers!  5/5 stars for me. I saw this as a kid and thought it was great
 It still delivers and is still highly entertaining,  even after all these years. If you're into the campy comedy-esque sorta off the wall 80's horrors, like I am... Then you are going to go Ape-S*** over this movie. I am in love with it!  ",1407024000,2,432,4.35
8040266,4,B00068NVQQ,Ok its silly 80's  low-budget z rated flick that never takes it self too seriously but I honestly love this movie. The cast can't act and the effects are good to cartoony in spots. The best thing I can say is if you like old school troma movies then this is right up your alley.,1404432000,,278,4.054545454545455
8040267,3,B00068NVQQ,Found it and watched it again.  It's a cheesy B-horror film that really is only worth watching with friends so you can make fun of it.  :),1396224000,,138,4.074074074074074

8040269,3,B00068NVQQ,"A somewhat better than average entry in the  genre, Flesh Easting Mothers is pretty much  what you'd expect.  The other review has gone into the details, and  if this is your kind of off-the-wall bad movie, well_____check it  out.",1255305600,2,230,4.794871794871795
