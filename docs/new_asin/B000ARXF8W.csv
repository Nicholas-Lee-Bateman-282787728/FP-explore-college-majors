2390455,4,B000ARXF8W,"National Geographic's ""The New World: Nightmare in Jamestown"" is a fast-paced, and engaging DVD that keeps young and old viewers attentive. The dramatizations and recreations are just graphic enough to let you know how dangerous life in the  colony was (sickness, hunger, paranoia, fear of Spain). The risks these people took to begin an English colony in the ""New World"" are made clear. The only thing really missing from this DVD is some background about prior English/Native American interactions (dating back before the Lost Colony at Roanoke Island) that would explain why the English had misconceptions about the Native Americans, and why the Native Americans were a threat to their lives from the very beginning. This is a great teaching tool for students 5th grade and up.",1140652800,60,780,5.141732283464567
2390456,4,B000ARXF8W,"National Geographic always seems to come up with the most interesting topics for historical review/movie-form! Since this film was made, even further evidence has been uncovered that seems to both compliment their findings as well as reinforce the nightmare that was for these settlers...without giving away to much, I won;t use the word ""poor"" as the brunt of those early idiots were of means and had no concept or desire to work...so go figure they showed up expecting to find gold lining the shorelines...apparently...so little sympathy should be found-esp. in how the burnt of them ended up treating the Indians...",1431561600,,618,5.19
2390457,5,B000ARXF8W,Excellent video about Jamestown.  Delivered on time and exactly as described.,1425254400,,77,6.0
2390458,4,B000ARXF8W,"The production values aren't the greatest -- it's a low-budget film with historical re-enactments made with underpaid (volunteer?) actors, cheap costumes, and repetitive editing.  It drips with macabre, over-dramatic music like so many of the cable channel shows that want to make creepy mysteries out of scientific or historical stories.

But the subject matter is fascinating, the exteriors and landscapes very beautiful, and the core script extremely well-written.  The story is a careful build of archaeological excavations, historical re-interpretations, and other discoveries and facts that lead to a compelling conclusion about the REAL reason the faltering early colonists finally were able to get a toehold in the New World.  The history buff in me was intrigued enough by the story and facts that I was able to overlook the cheesy elements.",1421280000,4,850,5.465648854961832

2390461,5,B000ARXF8W,"I teach, and often it is hard to find good educational videos to help the visual learners in my class.  This video is great at teaching about the research done on the Jamestown Settlement.",1390435200,,188,4.529411764705882
2390462,5,B000ARXF8W,I use this in my History Classes and the students enjoy it. They learn about Jamestown and have a great time learning,1383004800,,117,4.363636363636363
2390463,3,B000ARXF8W,"Like so many things produced regarding our nation's early history, this video suffers from over-glorification of the settlers and the Indians as simply ""hostile"" (which is repeated over and over).  This helps the perpetuate the great American lie that settlement of the ""new world"" was Europeans nobly bringing civilization to a wild and empty land.  The narration and statements of those interviewed is nearly all slanted FOR the settlers and AGAINST the natives.  Since the relationship between these two is a key element of the Jamestown story, it would have been better to describe the conflict and issues of both sides - not just make the settlers look like noble victims.
The archaeological parts were good and the overall presentation was well done (of course, because its National Geographic).  Other reviews complain of the style, but this style is needed to keep people's short attention span from losing interest.
This would be a good video for kids and to start to learn of the Jamestown story as long as it is coupled with a better explanation of why the natives were hostile to the invaders, er...settlers.",1374537600,,1120,5.005376344086022
2390464,2,B000ARXF8W,"Overall the production of Jamestown by National Geographic is solid.  Good use of factual evidence and solid interviews.  Having said that it is a disappointment to see the video use the same video bits of Native Americans sneaking through the forest as if that was all they did and then showing them shooting the same man in the back over and over.  This video, as other reviewers have indicated is for 5th grade level only.  I used it for a high school class and had them write a review and while many liked some parts of it and indicated that they learned something new about Jamestown, most commented that a sections repeated themselves and that the story could have been told in half the time without the addition of extraneous information.  Example, one segment is devoted to the mystery of an apparent fatal leg wound by firearm in a skeleton recovered on the Jamestown site.  An extended forensics about how did this happen, who shot him, a reenactment of potential scenarios to solve the mystery of whether he shot himself (totally implausible given the weapons of the day), did he get shot by a Native American who stole a gun, was he shot in anger by another colonist, or was it an accident... who cares about this discussion.  Get back to Jamestown.  Then the overly long and dramatic discussion of another skeleton found buried OUTSIDE the walls -- who was it, why outside the walls, ad infinitum on this mystery as well with all sorts of persons weighing in on his teeth and other bits.  It wanders a bit.  Then there is the cheesy fake beard on John Smith.  They spent lots of time and considerable money with period costumes (very clean all the time) and the colonists guns, showing them firing over and over (at what we never really know), - then enter John Smith scowling (at what we don't know) or gazing wistfully into the distance with the worst fake beard.  It's not horrible but then it's just not what I expected from National Geographic.  All is not lost - there are a number of great sections to show that provide information to reinforce content presented in the classroom.  If you see it in a bargain bin for $5 buy it, otherwise I would pass on it.",1345852800,14,2177,4.5629820051413885
2390465,4,B000ARXF8W,"Extremely in depth, Nightmare in Jamestown tells the stories of our nations colonization like you've never heard before. With constant threats of attack from Spain or the local tribes, sickness affecting almost all the members and others succumbing to starvation, life in Jamestown was usually short lived. The film tells of how England constantly needed to resupply the colony with more members because life was so difficult that most of the population did not survive.

Reenactments are very well done and viewers are able to follow the films progression easily. While the stories are not the typical picturesque ""Thanksgiving"" image you are use to, they give a much more accurate portrayle of what life during this time was truly like, and done in a way that is still appropriate for most audiences. The most intense images would be those of real skeletons that were found and excavated, making this an appropriate film for students in a classroom setting.

Nightmare in Jamestown is educational and intriguing at the same time. Worth watching a few times, since you might pick up other little details after watching it a second time.",1327449600,2,1137,5.042553191489362
2390466,5,B000ARXF8W,"This book, the Jamestown Project by Kupperman, is so terrific I have not had opportunity to read the other books on this subject I ordered.

It is amazing.  I recommend it as a vital read to every citizen of the United States of America.

2390467,2,B000ARXF8W,there is about 10 minutes of real content in this documentary. It is stretched and filled with cut scenes to a point of being pathetic.,1288915200,4,135,4.44
2390468,1,B000ARXF8W,"Scene cuts every three seconds, repetitious horror-movie music, about five minutes of content stretched over an hour. Looks like it was made by a music video producer for 10-year-olds. Judging from the other comments, it is successful as a teaching tool for kids. But if you're an adult looking for a serious documentary, don't waste your time on this.",1288483200,12,352,4.983050847457627
2390469,5,B000ARXF8W,"This DVD is a view of Jamestown through archeological review of the site.  The dangers they encountered are determined through archeological findings.  They were able to determine a person's standing in the community and the role/s they played in the settlement of Jamestown.  Forensic findings tell the story of Jamestown, Virginia...how they lived and how they died.",1284336000,6,368,5.421052631578948
2390470,5,B000ARXF8W,I  strongly recommend this video to teachers who are covering early colonial American history in their classes. It's a great supplement to the lesson. My students were very attentive while watching this video. The acting along with the excavation sites makes everything come alive for them.  They were inquisitive and always engaged. My students are eighth and tenth graders.,1254355200,4,375,5.338983050847458

2390472,5,B000ARXF8W,"My 5th grade students just finished watching this video.  We've been discussing the 13 colonies and I bought this so that they had something ""Visual"" to go along with it.  My kids absolutely loved it!  When we finished watching, they wanted another movie just like it to tell them about some of the other colonies.  It brings up information that the kids won't learn in the history books.  It's a great supplement.",1235520000,21,414,4.694444444444445
2390473,4,B000ARXF8W,"My husband and 5th grade students found this video quite interesting.  Personally I wasn't so crazy about the sensationalized nature of it, but if it gets 10-year-olds excited about history, hey, that's a good deal!  And it's not overly biased or poorly crafted or out of date or anything.  (It IS National Geographic, after all!)  If this is the only thing you're going to learn about Jamestown, it might not be your best bet historically, but it will definitely keep your interest.",1203897600,11,483,4.853658536585366
2390474,5,B000ARXF8W,"....interested so that itself is a high recommendation.  The use of ""pow"" sounding words and exciting vocabulary makes this subject more interesting.  There are several attempts to teach solid historical concepts and this would maybe work all the way down to 5th grade--in two parts w/an interesting follow up activity.  Some good use of graphics as in the reconstruction of the fort that indicates the colossal amounts of both work and fear that motivated colonial people around Native Americans.",1188000000,9,497,5.265822784810126
2390475,3,B000ARXF8W,"The documentary The New World: Nightmare in Jamestown is not my favorite.  In this 50-minute film, a major section was devoted to an exploration of what had happened at Jamestown from 1606 until 1612.  The reporting style was similar to that of the TV series, 48 hours: mystery.  You will see some skeletons on which autopsies were performed to figure out causes of the death.  The sites were revisited.  The Indian actors were dressed in conventional costume.  However, the scenes lost the flavor of originality.  What I dislike most is that causes of the voyages to Jamestown were only superficially touched, so were lingering impacts of the Jamestown legacy.  If you like 48 hours: mystery and seek for only information of what had happened in the Jamestown colony during that brief period, this documentary was probably made for you.  If you are interested in historical meanings of the Jamestown colony, probably you should find alternatives of information.",1154736000,54,962,5.076433121019108
