3628774,5,B001HBVE88,"""Black Is, Black Ain't"" raises the question of Black identity in America which is as relevant today as it was in the 90's when Riggs produced this movie. This is a fine artistic testament to his legacy.",1298246400,,202,4.486486486486487
3628775,5,B001HBVE88,"I saw Black is Black Aint years ago on PBS.  I miss Marlon Riggs because, he was such an amazing story telling genius.",1265500800,,118,4.130434782608695
3628776,5,B001HBVE88,"This movie/ documentary was wonderful. Marlon Riggs, wanted us to understand that there is not one solid voice nor, is there way to be black. Black just is. Black is a mixture of many races, histories, sexualities. In other words, we come in different shades and have different ideas. What has made us ""black"" is our history here in American. Through out this film, I realized how freeing is it to not allow the majority to speak for me or tell my story. However, more often than not, we're marginalized and some of us like/accept it as fact. He wanted to combat this. We are not totally represented in the media and some of us like it that way too. He challenges his own communities homophobia and sexism with flourish that will make you question, are you really who you think you are and where and how did you come to that conclusion. This was his last film and it's a beautiful gift that he left for all of us, who feel like we're ""outside the pail"" and that we'll never be able to join or turn away from the larger group that we are apart of. He reminds us all that it is not okay to be  follower and sit back remain silent. He wanted someone to stand up and speak. So, he did.  Thank you Marlon.",1242172800,16,1200,4.258771929824562
3628777,4,B001HBVE88,"I ""stumbled"" across this movie and could not wait to view it. When I did; I was beyond pleased. Riggs uses many voices in this film but the most powerful is the one of BLACK PEOPLE everywhere. The film is eccletic at every angle and literally touches on almost everything pro or con for Black People. I was inspired.",1241222400,9,316,4.372881355932203
3628778,5,B001HBVE88,The video was an insightful look at different ways in which the African American community defines itself but also the negative sides: the obstacles that can be divisive.  It is not only entertaining but combines a look at the community with one visionary filmmaker's journey coming to terms with his community and his own mortality and legacy.  Recommended.,1236988800,2,358,5.155172413793103
3628779,3,B001HBVE88,"In the same way that it was exciting for ""Tongues Untied"" to be put on DVD, this is too truly a great day.  Fans of Marlon Riggs are sure to get nostalgic seeing this.  This work is about the diversity in the African-American community, spoken in metaphor as a gumbo.  But it is also a memoriam of Riggs made during his last days.  Some people may be disturbed by the heavy Rainbow Flag influence here, but you should know what you're getting into if you have heard of the venerable Riggs.  While there are militant heroes like Angela Davis here, there are other interviewees, that if you knew more about them, you may see them as selloutish.  For those of us who saw this in the 1990s, it will be fascinating to watch it again and examine whether it has stood the test of time.  For example, HAART medications, 9/11, the DL, and many other phenomena have altered how we look at identity categories in the new millenium.  I do recommend this important documentary for all interested viewers.",1228521600,11,991,4.52808988764045

8308511,5,B001HBVE88,"Absolutely phenomenal, an excellent representation of the controversial ideas around what black is and what black is not - Exploring the 'battles' within the black community  in addition to the relationship between the non-black and black community.",1395446400,,249,5.72972972972973
8308512,4,B001HBVE88,"Well thought out - I like how he investigated through people from all aspects of life; young kids from the hood to well respected authors and modern philosophers, intertwining his own struggle with AIDS with the struggle for African Americans to come to terms with each other. It's thoughtful, humorous and melancholy, all at the same time. The metaphor between the differences in the black community being like a big pot of gumbo was very interesting - alone the parts are just ok, but when blended together make an amazing creation.",1385942400,,534,4.8791208791208796
8308513,5,B001HBVE88,"This film is a compelling exploration of historical and contemporary definitions of ""Blackness,"" and Riggs reveals how African Americans have re-claimed their identities by accepting, rejecting, and re-defining those notions. He also shows how Blacks, like himself, are comprised of intersecting identities - or ""gumboes,"" if you will - particularly across queer racial and sexual lines. I enjoyed every minute of this film. Riggs was a great talent.",1368835200,,450,5.632352941176471
8308514,5,B001HBVE88,"though a bit dated i really enjoyed the fact that this film is so inclusive. same gender love, womanism and every color of the rainbow is/are represented. there is a lot to be faced, dealt with and pondered in this film. i invited some friends over to watch and discuss. the conversation was spirited and enlightening.",1363824000,,318,4.696428571428571
8308515,5,B001HBVE88,"Exploration of Black identity from many angles within the community. I learned a few new things that I had never come across before. I would definitely recommend this film. As a side note, Marlon Riggs has additional works that are well worth watching. Enjoy!",1363219200,,259,4.909090909090909
8308516,5,B001HBVE88,"Honesty and communication can save a people and Martin Briggs shows us all how, with heart wrenching poetry this film is very good medicine. Recommended for every Black person, anyone who cares about AIDS, and every homosexual Black man.",1360195200,,237,5.102564102564102

8308518,5,B001HBVE88,"This is one of the most incredible documentaries to ever be made. I encourage all people - no matter who you are - to watch this film.
