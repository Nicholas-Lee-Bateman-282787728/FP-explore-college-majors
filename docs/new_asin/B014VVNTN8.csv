8732111,2,B014VVNTN8,"I purchased this as a souvenir at the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola.  It was the same price as Amazon, but I'm happy the proceeds went to the museum foundation.  If I had bought this anywhere else, I would probably be mad about it.  I'm glad to support the museum foundation, although I'll probably put this DVD set out at my next yard sale.  I wasn't impressed at all.  The copyright says 2015, but obviously the video itself has to be much older.  The information is good, but the production and editing is terrible.  I'm no video production professional, but I could have done better myself on my own laptop.  Just about all the arial footage has this annoying faded black vignette around the edge.  It's like watching an airplane perform through a drinking straw.  The graphics are grainy too.  The Blue Angel pilot interviews were shot in front of a green screen, which they replaced with horrible background graphics.  It makes me think of a low-budget TV station weather forecaster from about 20 years ago.  Probably the most annoying thing is the sound.  I kept having to turn my volume up and down.  The airshow announcer is about to blow the speakers out of my TV, and then it cuts to an interview that is barely audible after turning down the volume from the previous scene.",1465516800,9,1306,4.6173913043478265
