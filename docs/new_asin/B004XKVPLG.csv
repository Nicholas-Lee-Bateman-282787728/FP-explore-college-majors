4495837,1,B004XKVPLG,"I fell asleep watching each episode, and that's not hyperbole. This series seems to be made for the tiny audience of people who are both completely ignorant of modern astronomy and physics and yet interested enough to watch Brian Cox aw shucks his way across the world, not so much teaching science as trying to impart religious-like awe toward the universe. That shtick gets old very fast.",1315440000,7,390,4.835820895522388
4495838,1,B004XKVPLG,"A most attractive subject is presented with a monotonous delivery supported by distracting  photography that can not free itself from the overuse of siluets and poor lighting.  The resulting product from this attempt to be ""different"" includes a somewhat arrogant Brian Cox who can not control his pseudointelectual arrogance and repetitive diction.  Certainly, the BBC has distinguished itself by the production of exceptional high quality documentaries, perhaps the DVD 'Wonders of the Universe' is the exception that proves the rule.  Eventually this DVD will be discarded.",1315440000,11,576,5.662790697674419
4495839,5,B004XKVPLG,"I watched the Wonders of the Solar System DVD with great interest. Professor Brian Cox's strong Manchester diction may throw some listeners off. Nevertheless, his wisely chosen narratives with easy-to-follow illustrations clearly illucidated every topic he covered on the subject matter. His overwhelmingly enthusiastic presentation style may bother some new viewers, but personally I find the unpretentious child-like excitement in his approach to the wonders of the new scientific discoveries in our universe very infectious. This highly commendable DVD is one of the most educational videos on the mind-boggling physical laws of cosmology that should be watched again and again. Easy to understand and entertaining.

4495840,5,B004XKVPLG,"i do agree with some other reviews here, Brian Cox seems to be a little bit more pessimistic about the ""arrow of time"" i mean lets face it, no one really knows, there could be an infinite cycle of big bangs continuing through an infinite space, it just seems to me with his time claims he really didn't back it up with exact proof, however i agree with another reviewer here that Gravity is by far the best episode on this disc, it is excellent.  i also enjoyed stardust, that episode will be nice for a date night since its all ooooo we are made out of stardust how cute... lol",1315180800,6,578,4.207207207207207
4495841,5,B004XKVPLG,"Professor Brian Cox explores big cosmic questions and explains things in down to earth terms. As a presenter he has a natural approach and his childlike enthusiasm is infectious. The cinematography is stunning and the computer graphics are top notch. The music is sweeping and beautiful. Almost like a meditation on life, the universe and how we're all connected.

I found each episode to be thoroughly enjoyable. Professor Cox has a genuine love of science and clearly wants to share it with as many people as possible. He does so in a way that is neither boring or redundant. This is one of the finest series on the universe I've seen. A real fresh approach. I recommend viewing with the lights off for the full experience.",1314748800,18,725,4.753968253968254
4495842,2,B004XKVPLG,"Brian Cox is not a David Attenborough.

4495843,1,B004XKVPLG,"This is the first ""science"" dvd I ever bought that I can say that I truly hate.  This Brian Cox character believes himself to be some sort of great philosopher who can find ways to spend thousands of words to say that things that could simply be stated in ten.  No matter how many times I try to get through this video, I cannot make it.  I want to just scream as I hear him emphasizing every second or third syllable, believing himself to be some gifted orator. I love videos about science and physics, but this one is so damned boring and annoying and simplistic that I cannot possibly see how anyone can give it more than one star. Save your money. This is unquestionably the worst science BluRay/DVD I have ever purchased.",1309910400,15,726,4.402985074626866
4495844,5,B004XKVPLG,"The minority who did not like ""Wonders of the Solar System"" will not like ""Wonders of the Universe"", but the many more who did like it will enjoy this one too - though it is not quite as good as the first series in my opinion. It has been claimed that it has little serious science. This is true. For example, compare what was said about the arrow of time and entropy with the Wikipedia page on the subject, which contains much more information on a single page. However, this misses the point. Professor Cox has rightly described the series as a ""cinematic experience"". It combines state-of-the-art CGI, wonderful astronomical photos, soaring music, exotic locations, fancy camerawork, and the infectious enthusiasm of Cox himself. As for the science, there may not be much depth but the topics covered are very well done and explained with crystal clarity. Everybody watching these DVDs, whether a child or a senior, will complete their viewing with some understanding of topics ranging from the life and death of the universe and the formation of the elements, to gravity and light. Just as important it is likely to have inspired enthusiasm and a sense of wonder. For that we must thank Brian Cox. The impact he has made with both ""Wonders"" series can be gauged by the fact he is being called by many ""the David Attenborough of astrophysics"". High praise indeed.",1308355200,48,1366,4.7923728813559325
4495845,5,B004XKVPLG,"Just as the first reviewer, this is based on the series as it aired on the BBC. It does not speak for any additional scenes or features that may be found in the disc version.

Similarly to Wonders of the Solar System, Wonder of the Universe focuses on familiar subjects and doesn't pretend to teach advanced physics to the audience. It's a show aimed at facilitating understanding of appealing subjects and to initiate the viewer into ideas and concepts that can lead to much deeper - and more interesting - waters.

Professor Cox is a great presenter, as his attitude and general excitement about these subjects is very easily contagious. I suppose he's easy to relate to because he speaks our language - that of the layman - when explaining things that took the greatest scientists in history decades to decipher.

The 4 episodes do a good job at staying within their topics, so an overwhelming number of concepts are not thrown around, which makes these otherwise complicated subjects easy to follow. The second episode - Stardust - is particularly awesome. Even though it's something most people are probably familiar with, it never fails to excite you when you see it presented in such a way. The fact that every atom in my body once exploded from within a star will never bore me :)

My only complaint is that it's only 4 episodes long. The good news? There's a 'Wonders of Life' in the works :)",1306195200,43,1401,4.659919028340081
4495846,4,B004XKVPLG,"This review is based on the series as aired in the UK, March 2011. This is a follow-up to `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonders-of-the-Solar-System/dp/B003NF97OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonders of the Solar System</a>'; it has the same format with Brian Cox travelling the world. As usual, some science background will help you to appreciate this series, my degree is in physics. I found it a bit slow, it is also dumbed down in places, and it is only four episodes, hence only 4 stars. The account of the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements in stars and supernovae was fascinating, we are all made of star dust (Ep 2).

Episodes (adapted from BBC iPlayer and youtube)

1. Destiny

Professor Brian Cox explores the laws of the universe. In this episode, Brian seeks to understand the nature of time and its role in creating both the universe and ourselves.

It looks at the furthest star that we know, which blew up 13.0bn years ago. It looks at the arrow of time which is always moving forward, which he relates to the second law of thermodynamics, entropy always increases, i.e. the tendency to go from order to disorder. He looks at the stelliferous era. The red dwarfs will be the longest lived stars in the universe, because they burn their fuel so slowly. The death of stars will be in a 100 trillion years time, leading to the heat death of the universe when all matter will disappear leaving only photons. However the good news is that the arrow of time gives a point in time (i.e. now) when intelligent life is possible in the universe. He ends with the single pixel picture of earth taken by Voyager.

2. Stardust

What are we and where do we come from? Professor Brian Cox finds out. The account of the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements in stars and supernovae was fascinating. As my degree is in physics, I have already bought a text book on cosmology and am thinking of buying one on nucleosynthesis, so be careful this stuff can become addictive.

This episode deals with the lives of stars, or stellar evolution. Especially element formation in stars through nucleosynthesis and heavy elements in supernova. All the 92 elements we find on earth are made from stars, so we are actually stardust. Our sun is only converting hydrogen into helium through nuclear fusion which creates the energy that we get from the sun. The creation of elements heavier than helium only occur at the end of a stars life, when it has run out of hydrogen and a star becomes a red giant. Then helium is fused to produce carbon and oxygen. For massive stars the process continues and carbon fuses to become magnesium, sodium, neon and aluminium, this continues until only iron is formed. There are over 60 elements heavier than iron in the universe and they can only be created by stars nine times the mass of the sun. Once iron fusion has been reached, no further fusion is possible and the star collapses under its own gravity and rebounds forming a supernova in which the heavy elements are formed. So we are all made out of stardust from the death of a star billions of years ago. He ends up discussing the Orion nebula in which new stars are being formed from the remains of dead ones, a similar nebula from which our sun and solar system emerged. If we look at the spectrum of a nebula we find complex hydrocarbon chemicals which are the building blocks of life. And we find evidence of this in meteorites, including amino acids. If one looks at this episode, it shows how the death of a star produces new life, including our own.

Ep. 3. Falling

This is about gravity, and so far is the best in the series.

Cox experiences weightlessness in an aircraft, falling at the speed of gravity? The moon always faces the earth due to tidal interaction, and there is a 7 m tidal bulge in the rock on the moon. Gravity locks many solar systems into our Milky Way. The Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way are hurtling towards each other at 0.5 million km/hr and will collide in 3 billion years and Cox shows us a computer simulation. We are a part of the Virgo cluster of 2,000 galaxies. Cox then takes a ride in a centrifuge, at just over 1g he is on Neptune, at 2.5g he is on Jupiter, at 4g and 5g he is on an exo-planet (our Sun has 28g). When a massive star runs out of fuel it implodes under the weight of its own gravity and then rebounds to form a supernova, leaving a tiny neutron star at the centre, rotating at 30/s (a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum). He then goes on to consider the perihelion precession of Mercury which can only be explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity (1915), Newtonian gravity just did not do it (c 1680's).

Ep. 4. Messengers.

Professor Brian Cox explores the laws of the universe. He shows how light holds the key to our understanding of the whole universe, including our own deepest origins.

Light is a messenger that takes us into the past, which has travelled over 13 billion years to reach us, for example, the 2004 Hubble ultra deep field pictures of distant galaxies. He also takes a look at the cosmological microwave background radiation (CMB), discovered in 1965, which showed that the CMB had a temperature of 2.7 degrees Kelvin. It also convinced most of the scientific commununity that the hot Big Bang model of cosmology was correct.",1304812800,88,5356,4.673036093418259

4495894,5,B004XKVPLG,"In this television series, Professor Brian Cox takes us on a whirlwind tour of the universe, from the very earliest moments of its origins after the Big Bang, to the deep distant future after all stars have burned out and the universe expires in an eternity of cold and static lifelessness.

Despite the often amazing and terrifying range, scope and size of the phenomena surveyed, Professor Cox keeps the audience engaged with a light approach that combines the right degree of explanation, analogy and humour without dumbing down the science or treating the audience like idiots.  Professor Cox also has a gift for communicating the wonder and beauty of the universe, even in such a violent event as a stellar explosion or the formation of a neutron star that emits enough radiation to vaporise a person in the blink of an eye.

Given our current tendency to naval-gaze and focus on the 'self' at the expense of everything else, sometimes we need a reminder of how small and insignificant we are in the scheme of things - both time and space.  I think despite protests of humility, religious people could do with a 'creation' refresher as well - it might help reduce the human pride that underlies a lot of claims to be special and favoured above others just because you believe in a certain deity.

4495950,2,B004XKVPLG,"Our family owns over 21 of the BBC documentaries on blu-ray, and I did not hesitate at all when purchasing both Wonders of the Solar System and Wonders of the Universe.  The BBC has achieved the status of the absolute documentary king, the new bar for amazing nature docs.  Documentaries like Planet Earth, Africa, Frozen Planet, Life, Wild China, Ganges, etc..., etc... are unmatched beautiful pieces of informative art.
However, these 2 BBC Brian Cox ""Wonders"" series are a huge disappoint, and I mean a disappointment to our entire family ranging from ages 5-40.  I was truly hoping that these 2 would fill in the needed cosmological gap of BBC nature documentaries.  Not to be.

First, when I watch a documentary about planetary or cosmological things - I expect to see space.  A LOT OF SPACE!  Planets!  Galaxies!  Light!  However, what we end up seeing in both of these documentaries are Brian Cox.  My son even asked me if the documentary was about the ""talking guy"" or if it was supposed to be about ""space"".  That's pretty telling.  We see more of Cox's ridiculous reactions than we ever see of actual cosmological phenomena.  It's like MTV made a documentary and was aiming at an audience of ADHD teenagers.  The actual information is watered down and they skim over all the important information that might actually be interesting, and the entire production seems to focus more on Brian Cox wearing different 'cool' outfits for every shot and walking around in different locales to loud music.  If you've watched space docs in the past, you will notice immediately how little they actually show space.  In fact, sometimes they show Brian Cox so much that the actual phenomena he is watching get MISSED!  For instance, he is demonstrating in one episode the explosive reaction that occurs when pure sodium is combined with water.  We hear the explosion, but we don't even see it!  The camera never leaves Cox's laughing face.  And if I have to watch this guy muss his hair on camera one more time.... oh boy.

Secondly, I am completely confused as to why they spend over 60 percent of each episode on things that do not belong in a space documentary.  If I want to learn about sea turtles, bubbles, children in India, abandoned prisons, etc... - I will watch one of the other truly great BBC documentaries about these things.  They spend so little time on the actual concepts implied on the cover, that you end up watching a second-rate documentary about a hodge-podge of things that looks like it's produced to be a music video instead of a science documentary.

Sadly, the BBC has fallen just a tiny bit in our estimation of their documentary status with these 2 stinkers.  Hopefully, the director of these 2 is not an omen of future BBC docs.  I don't think so, because I've seen some nature documentaries that were produced after these 2, and they are much better.
Overall, if you really want to watch a great space/cosmology/universe documentary - it's still hard to beat Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" series.  Even though it's much older and doesn't have the flashy computer graphics that this does, it's a much more informative, MUCH BETTER NARRATED true space documentary.  Sagan never looked like he was trying to act/look as ""cool as possible"".  I have a feeling it might be a long time before the Cosmos series is matched by a modern space documentary.  Save your money on these 2 and try Cosmos instead, if you haven't already.",1379894400,4,3441,4.761824324324325
4495951,5,B004XKVPLG,Brian cox correlates everything of his description with simplest examples and formats which we come accross routinely. One of the most amazing and well presented series . Full credits to Prof. Cox,1379030400,,196,5.15625
4495952,5,B004XKVPLG,"Brian Cox is the, 'Indiana Jones' of today's astrophysicsists.  Looking at him in such inicredibly different environments explaining such  incrediblet heories such as, Time/Space theory...very cool!!  I am sure ol' Carl Sagan would've given this series a hearty thumbs up!",1378598400,,272,5.75
4495953,5,B004XKVPLG,"Brian Cox presents this material in an interesting and logical manner. It reminds me of the genius of Carl Sagan. It is almost as if Sagan has been reincarnated and returned from the grave with new up to date discoveries of the Universe around us. In fact, I feel Cox is a better teacher than Sagan as I have learned so much more through him. This show is both entertaining and informative.",1377648000,,390,4.430555555555555
4495954,5,B004XKVPLG,Very interesting and instructive ideas. Original examples are given to help explain scale and other principles that are seemingly easy to get but not truly so. Love the way places on earth are shown to help understand the cosmos.,1376611200,,229,4.897435897435898

4495976,5,B004XKVPLG,"This show is a real life-changer. No matter what your life is like, or whatever faith you have, this series will move you. Professor Brian Cox talks about things that you probably have never thought about in your life, or knew was possible. He takes you to places you never thought existed and helps you understand the vastness of the universe but in a way us ""non professors"" can understand.

This is truly a remarkable series and one that has changed my life. I now have the beginning of an understanding that we are only a spec in this vast universe and in the great length of time.

Watch the show and I hope it changes your life like it did mine.",1373328000,3,651,4.327868852459017
4495977,5,B004XKVPLG,Professor Brian Cox has a passion for understanding the way the universe works and explains physics concepts clearly. He makes it easy to follow how the universe developed to where we are now and appreciate our place in it.,1371600000,,223,4.743589743589744

4495980,1,B004XKVPLG,"I'm not addressing the content of the show here, as it was excellent. What is amiss is the mix of music to voice. Most of the time, when music is playing as background, it's not background, it's louder than Cox's voice to the point it drowns him out and I was left reading subtitles to know what he was saying. I've read they remixed this and fixed the imbalance, but it's not this version. I am disappointed in the purchase.",1365638400,10,425,4.325

4495996,5,B004XKVPLG,"Being a mathetician as well as studying physics and being an amateur astronomer, I will say that I didn't learn any new information from the series, but I did realize different and wonderful ways of visualizing the universe and several physical and chemical processes that I found enlightening and enjoyable.  The series also made these scientific topics very artistic and majestic.  I've always loved the science, but the series gave me a deeper appreciation of the artistry of nature.  I've also read Brian Cox's books and watched the Wonders of the Solar System and loved them all, but my personal favorite would be the Wonders of the Universe.  I personally have always been a fan of Carl Sagan's Cosmos since that was originally inspired my love for astronomy at a young age, I would have to say that I think modern audiences would prefer the Wonders of the Universe since the Cosmos series would be viewed as dated by a younger audience.",1362268800,,943,4.802469135802469
4495997,5,B004XKVPLG,I find that Brian's books and perspectives as well as his TV series was extremely educational and entertaining. I find that Brian's friendly and casual approach makes him a pleasure to watch.,1360886400,,191,5.0

4495999,5,B004XKVPLG,"WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE, Professor Brian Cox

Dear AMAZON,  Professor Brian Cox helped me understand more about the Universe than any other previous DVD's, books, news, magazine articles I've watched and read about the Universe ~ Prof. Cox brought it all together.  I've read that he is a wonderful and enthusiastic Professor at England's Manchester University, and; know he is a marvelous narrator and story teller of his Wonders of the Universe.  I loved how he told the story with his trips and experiences all leading up to understanding more about how the Universe works.  His DVD's are perfect for the layperson who is interested in hearing about Science, Physics and attempting to understand this Universe that continues to astound us.

Really looking forward to his books and DVD's on his upcoming new Wonders of Life.  I have them in my Amazon orders as they become available and signed on your waiting list for his new book release in May 2013 through my Kindle.  You were sold out of the Wonders of Life DVD (Christmas-time) but thanks for ordering more.  Thank you AMAZON!  I love your Company!  I also love your Kindle (mine is the first one you introduced and still wonderful.)  Thank you for being the best!!",1355961600,,1223,4.826923076923077

4496001,5,B004XKVPLG,"This is great entry level physics.

What are we and where do we come from? Professor Brian Cox finds out. The account of the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements in stars and supernovae was fascinating. As my degree is in physics, I have already bought a text book on cosmology and am thinking of buying one on nucleosynthesis, so be careful this stuff can become addictive.",1355875200,,375,4.681818181818182
4496002,5,B004XKVPLG,"I also own 'Wonders Of The Solar System' and I really enjoyed it. This one is just as interesting if not better. This is an excellent purchase, especially if you are into Astronomy and the like. Something like Carl Sagan's Cosmos is very interesting (albeit a bit boring for average people) but this here presents to any type of crowd.

Professor Brian Cox is amazing at his presentations. His enthusiasm compiled with the awesome graphics and information provided equal for a very enjoyable experience. There's enough info to keep an Astronomer hooked but worded nicely so that even someone oblivious to Astronomy could follow.

BBC never fails with the cinematography. They use excellent equipment and the camera-men seem to know all the best angles. I swear BBC must use the best cameras available on the planet. The music is pretty rad also and flows together beautifully with the HD landscapes. I really appreciate the use of the vignetting in this flick. This would also be a great video to throw on when you have house guests over and want to show off your flat screen.

Bottom line, if you want a good astronomy movie, buy this. You won't regret it. If you seen the first one and enjoyed it you will more than likely enjoy this one. 5 stars... and I hope they make more similar blu rays like this.",1354147200,4,1305,4.665217391304348
4496003,5,B004XKVPLG,"Brian Cox has a wonderfully boyish enthusiasm. The wonders of our universe are breathtaking by themselves, but when Brian Cox tells you about them, he will leave you in awe, inspired, and happy. You will experience amazing stories and beautiful cinematography. I loved it.",1344556800,,272,5.204545454545454
4496004,5,B004XKVPLG,"Both my husband and I were so impressed with this series.  My husband is an amateur astronomer, self-taught for about 30 years.  We both thought there would be little in these DVDs that would be news to my husband, but he was astounded by how much he learned.  One of the things I love about Brian Cox's presentation style is his obvious passion for his work.  He's a highly educated physicist, yet he has the most down to earth way of explaining things.  Using simple drawings or positioning of common objects Brian had me saying 'wow - now I understand how that works' - or 'wow, that makes sense now'.  The other awesome thing about these DVDs is the high quality and resolution of the pictures, not to mention all of the footage from the Mars rovers.  With regard to the reviewer who mentioned a repetitive nature in the DVDs, I believe this is because each DVD can be viewed as an individual presentation, so Brian uses an explanatory preface for each DVD that is somewhat similar from one disc to the next.  This is to be expected based on the way the series is designed.  I would give this 7 or 8 stars if the review system went that high.  Purchase this series and enjoy both the beautiful pictures and the educational value of Brian Cox's journey through the solar system presented by the BBC.  Thank you, Brian!",1343174400,,1321,4.485355648535565

The Wonders of the Universe was the first one that did not work when I received it.  I tried several times and it just continues to load, never finishing.  Don't know where Amazon got this product, but be careful.",1341446400,2,339,4.234375
4496016,2,B004XKVPLG,"Love Cox's books, but this documentary series has him looking like he's stoned and spoon-feeding pabulum to what he must assume are the dimmest people on the planet, while leaving behind an ENORMOUS and wholly unnecessary carbon footprint.  I can't recall having learned one thing from this series, and Cox actually takes a trip to some South American mountaintop to show us what steam (from hot springs) turning to ice crystals on cold rocks looks like.

Cox is a natural ally (we share a distaste for superstition and both love natural wonders), and as I said, I like his books very much.  ""Wonders"" is twee, it is dumbed down science rather than popular science, and as a result, despite taking us to several exotic locations as a distraction, it is dull.",1339977600,3,758,4.770992366412214
4496017,1,B004XKVPLG,"I am a space junkie and love to watch Morgan Freeman, Hawkins or Asimov talk about space. But I am astonished how BBC could fail to recognize the flaw in this narrator's character. This narrator talks about well-known phenomenon and then feigns philosophical bewilderment while taking partial credit for the creation of the universe. The program is a total failure mostly due to the narrators personality and I am surprised some folks rate it high which makes me wonder if this fellow has friends and relatives among Amazon buyers. Don't waste your hard-earned dollar on this DVD. The DVD is worthless and boring.",1339027200,5,613,4.961165048543689

That's saying a lot, since I am a lifetime-consumer and seeker of science education.  It is impossible for me to over-recommend this brilliant educational series.  I also previously viewed Brian Cox's 'Wonders of the Solar System,' which is also fabulous.  I don't agree that 'Wonders of the Universe' is just a follow-up to 'Wonders of the Solar System.' Rather, it is a 'stand-alone' program which needs no other to make it complete.  Don't miss this program, for no matter what your educational background is, you will understand what Brian Cox teaches in this 'Wonders of the Universe' series.  And in understanding it, it will change you and lead you to a more positive experience of being alive. I wish EVERYONE who speaks English would view this series!",1338508800,,856,4.992957746478873
4496019,3,B004XKVPLG,"I really enjoyed Wonders of the Solar System (WSS) so I was excited when I found out that there was a ""sequel"". Unfortunately, in this shorter series, Professor Cox seems to be more rehearsed and therefore, it has less appeal than the first, which was brought to life by his enthusiasm for the subject.

There are four episodes in this 2 disc DVD...
1)Destiny
2)Stardust
3)Falling
4)Messengers
None of these are repeats of what was in the first DVD series (eg the episode on gravity here is called ""Falling"" and it's not the same as the episode ""What on earth is wrong with gravity"" which was a special feature on the WSS 3 disc DVD set).

I would still recommend it, especially for kids, because it's very educational. Professor Cox really does explain things well. Also, even though most people would consider Cosmos a better series this is more up to date.

The other DVDs I would recommend on this subject are 1)Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking and 2)Universe (History Channel Series) seasons one and two.",1336435200,6,1015,4.72316384180791

4496022,5,B004XKVPLG,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  Brian Cox is amazing with the way he delivers mid-blowing facts in such a casual and understandable way.  He truly makes the show as his passion, respect, and love for the cosmos becomes really contagious.  I recommend this to anyone who like learning about the universe, but wants something a little more serious than ""The Universe"".  You gotta check out ""Wonders of the Solar System"" as well.  Cox kills it in that series, too.  Unbelievable.",1329868800,3,479,4.925
4496023,5,B004XKVPLG,"Professor Cox has a palpable passion for astrophysics, and an infectious awe of the universe in which we live.

4496024,1,B004XKVPLG,"A great deal of money was spent, and wasted, sending the very young Mr. Cox to exotic locales so he could play with rocks, look longingly to the heavens, and intone platitudes. The Discovery Channel effect, CGI and oh-so-clever camera tricks substituted for oh-so-boring facts, is rampant here. Apparently nobody at the BBC remembers a certain other series, created a few decades ago, that covered all this and much, much more. Mr. Cox's earnest, straight-faced proclamation that ""we are all part of the universe"" makes me incredulous that an organisation (note spelling) as buttoned-up as the BBC can produce such twaddle; I thought only the Discovery stable of dizzy producers could do something like this. I would rather re-watch ""Cosmos"" on VHS on a old 19 inch Trintron than waste time and disgust on this ""My Weekly Reader"" with lots-o-money on a high-end plasma. ""Cosmos"" is the enduring standard, and this is childish and unworthy of the BBC.

Thankfully the new Cosmos is airing and soon this disposable ""Wonders Of The Universe"" series will be forgotten.",1328054400,13,1064,5.045454545454546

This program is not intended for the hard scientist. It geared in my opinion to the general audience, and as a high school math and science teacher, I think the program is perfect for young students, who don't need to understand the math behind the theories, just yet! I especially like the topic on the formation of the elements and why heavy elements like gold are so rare on earth, and how it all ties into our existence.

Assuming that it will play, this four-part series hosted by British physicist Brian Cox takes the viewer on a wandering journey through some key themes in cosmology -- time, gravity, chemistry, and light.  The format is unusual.  Instead of a documentary, the series is more like a narrative.  Cox travels to various locations on earth in order to illustrate scientific principles.  For instance, the decay of a wrecked ship is used as a metaphor for increasing entropy, a force which will cause the universe to cool down as it expands.  The narrative style is unusual, and at times the series meanders too much.  Nonetheless, the ideas are interesting and the science is accurate.",1519516800,,816,4.912408759124087
