8229218,5,B00000F0X7,My wife and I will be taking a cruise through the canal in a few months and wanted a preview of what to expect.  This video is very good and I recommend it for those who will be taking a cruise and also for those who will not but are interested in what it is like.,1282521600,,264,3.7142857142857144
8229219,3,B00000F0X7,"At the time I write this Amazon lists James Benning as the director.  Just a warning this is not O Panama from Benning which I was expecting, in fact I would be very surprised to discover that Benning had anything to do with it.  Instead it is a generic documentary about the Panama canal.  Hopefully this will keep others from making the same mistake.

So if you are looking for a Benning film, skip this one.  If you are here looking for a generic documentary about the Panama canal then this might be the film for you.

(I apologize for rating this three stars I only watched 5 minutes of it, but Amazon won't let me write this review without rating it).",1206316800,3,657,4.344262295081967
