358681,4,6301798678,"Charlie Chan films are frequently accused of pandering to racial stereotypes.  There is a certain truth to this, but Charlie Chan and company were neither more nor less stereotypical than such other popular series as the ""Blondie"" or ""Dr. Kildare"" series, and--while we may occasionally roll our eyes at a few 1930s sensibilities--its stereotypes are never mean-spirited and Charlie (along with his various sons) is always presented in a positive light.
CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA is certainly one of the finest--and some argue the single best--of the series for the film was not made as quickly or inexpensively as most in the series. OPERA is given the first class treatment, and producers even went so far as to have Oscar Levant write an opera (""Carnival"") for use in the film.  The film pits Warner Oland's Chan, played with typical drop-dead aplomb, against none other than Boris Karloff, who plays a mysterious patient escaped from an insane asylum and now haunting an opera house during a stellar performance.  Keye Luke appears as Chan's ""number one son"" Lee, and the supporting cast also includes such notables as Netta Harrigan and the always welcome William Demarest.  The story and script are slight, but every one concerned is clearly having a terrific time with the project, and the result is quite a bit of fun.  Fans of the series will enjoy it, and it is a recommended introduction to Charlie Chan for newcomers as well.",1011139200,15,1437,4.921487603305785

It was a rainy night outside the sanatorium. One inmate sings opera and plays the piano; an amnesia victim who is unknown. A newspaper brings back a memory, so he overpowers the guard and escapes. The police search for this madman. Charlie Chan is called in to help, and shows his powers of observation. Opera singer Lilli Rochelle asks for police protection, she received a threat with her flowers. [There are funny comments sprinkled among the dialogue.] Back at the opera the madman remembers his name; he used to be a singer. Madame Rochelle has a jealous husband, and he threatens baritone Borelli. There is a mystery within the opera. The police chase Borelli, but he is found dead inside a locked room. Chan notices the blood is drying, there must have been a double on stage. The search finds Lilli but she is stabbed dead too! Then we learn more about Lilli's secret past.

Chan finds an old newspaper clipping and seeks an old photograph. We see the latest technology that sends a picture thousands of miles in minutes, facsimile transmission. Chan shows his wisdom and judgment, he makes no assumptions about the facts in this case. [Did you make an assumption about the guilty party before the ending?] The aria in the opera is repeated, then a shot rings out. Chan explains why the obvious suspect was innocent, and then reveals the real murderer! He then asks a favor of a young woman to save another life. There is a happy ending, and Chan can return to Honolulu on time.

This is another example where love or money leads to murder. Uncovering hidden facts leads to a solution. It is one of the better films in the series because of its higher production values.",1412812800,,1705,4.657807308970099

7815159,4,6301798678,"1937's ""Charlie Chan at the Opera"" is a better than average episode in the long running Charlie Chan series.  Warner Oland stars as the titular Honolulu Police Detective, with Keye Luke as Number One Son, while Boris Karloff has an outstanding guest role as an escaped mental patient now haunting an opera house in the manner of ""The Phantom of the Opera.""

The story opens with Karloff's escape from a mental institution, then presents a murder at an Opera House to draw in Charlie Chan.  Chan is his usual inscrutable self in his police work, with veteran character actor William Demarest (Uncle Charlie of ""My Three Sons"") as his none-too-bright foil on the local police force.  The plot itself is filled with the usual collection of suspects and more than the usual number of red herrings; only the most attentive viewers may guess the plot resolution before the conclusion.  Number One Son gets a little help from his college fraternity brothers on the case, as he and his intrepid father race to prevent another murder.  Karloff is superb as Gravelle, an operatic singer and amnesiac who is by turns lucid and confused about what may or may not have happened in the Opera House during a fire several years earlier.

This Charlie Chan is a better than average entry in the series, with some good acting and an enjoyable plot.  It is highly recommended to fans of the series and is long overdue for conversion to DVD.",1206921600,,1421,4.724696356275303
7815160,5,6301798678,The whole series has some great movies and some awful movies...this one is just fantastic.  Boris Karloff is great and the movie is a must have.  I cant wair for the DVD!,1150848000,2,170,4.28125
7815161,1,6301798678,"Ok so Ive never seen a whole charlie chan movie and probably never will so I cant judge the quality of an entire film.  Its not surprising that all the reviews here trying to justify racism are written by caucasians.  So since all movies in the 30's were racist, it makes them ok....what a crock!  So people shouldnt complain about this movie because they were generous enough to allow an Asian to star in a film instead of using makeup to make non-Asians into a what a stereotypical Asian is supposed to look like.  Oh brother, do you guys know what the definition of racism is?  Yes people have a right to watch this film if they are so inclined.  But people also have the right to say films like this belong in the garbage.  Would caucasians complain if Native Americans made a film that depicted the genocidal acts of caucasians which include racial overtones?  Come on its 2006, get real people, and get out of the trailer park please.",1146873600,,940,4.488235294117647
7815162,5,6301798678,"I Really resent the fact that Turner Classic stopped showing the Charlie Chan films due to protests by Asian Americans.  Were the films racist and stereotyping Orientals?  Yeah...Sure they were.  But how many movies of the 30's and 40's were not stereotypical in some way?  Whether it was of any race or creed.  Hiding them away doesn't mean they never happened.  And although the actors who portrayed Charlie Chan may not have been Asian, they always portrayed him in a favorable light as being much smarter than the crooks he helped to capture.  And of course many co-starred Keye Luke as #1 son who was an Asian-American.

This film represents the pinnacle of the Chan films and may be the best ever. Certainly the film was aided greatly by the inclusion of Boris Karloff in the cast as Gravelle, an opera star who has been living in an asylum for many years due to amnesia.  When he sees a newspaper with his former wife on the front page, Gravelle's memories start to return and he escapes the asylum in a brilliant opening sequence, heavily influenced by Universals classic horror films.

Gravelle is now plotting revenge against his former wife and her lover as they had tried to murder him in a fire years earlier, causing him to lose his memory.  When the pair eventually turn up dead, Charlie Chan is called in to solve the murder and is joined by #1 son.  Gravelle is obviously the main suspect but Chan has other thoughts.

Simply a marvelous film that works so well.  A great mystery with wonderful performances, especially from Karloff who played this type of character so well.  William Demarest plays Sergeant Kelly who gets most of the politically incorrect comic relief lines although they are all pretty harmless.  H. Bruce Humberstone directed this film and was his second of four Chan films he would direct.  The film is expertly paced and checks in, like most, at just over an hour.

Quite enjoyable and a mystery that holds up well over the years.  It's quite unfortunate that these earlier films with Warner Oland as Chan are not on DVD while many of  the generally awful Toller films are.  Hopefully someone wakes up and realizes that there are a lot of fans clamouring for these on DVD.",1111017600,6,2212,4.678756476683938
7815163,4,6301798678,"This is a terrific film that shows the quality of the Charlie Chan series. Set in a theatre showing an opera, Chinese private detective Chan and his son solve a baffling murder mystery with plenty of false leads.
The opera being performed was actually written for the film by Oscar Levant and the recording is still available today. One of the main suspects Karloff seems to have wondered in from a Universal horror film, but it does not detract from the overall quality of the film. It is great fun.
It is not possible today to watch Charlie Chan without seeing some racial undertones. It is worth noting that it is an Asian character who is mentally faster and far more polite than his counterparts that solves the mysteries. He never resorts to violence and is calm in all situations. Rather than being racist, perhaps the films were a slap in the face to those who considered whites to be superior. But it must be said some scenes do jar a bit.
The mystery is played fair. All the clues are there. So go and enjoy it.",1045699200,22,1021,4.46524064171123
7815164,4,6301798678,Warner Oland played Chan for the thirteenth time and Boris Karloff co-starred in this somewhat overrated film. Music credits were shared with two others by none other than Oscar Levant. Boris Karloff's role was that of an operatic baritone. He actually used his own singing voice. Lee Chan was again played by Keye Luke.,1030320000,4,320,4.944444444444445
