3918995,5,B002EOVX9W,"Hello all,

This is one of the best serial comedies out, what I think caps it off is the DVD's themselves.

The menu's are just suberb each different selection has a new menu which is just

amazing, eg the Episode select on Season 1 is a whole little game.

You can just watch the menu's

Do yourself a favour and watch it.",1253059200,,323,4.145161290322581
3918996,5,B002EOVX9W,"This is one of those amazingly funny shows that make me laugh like crazy. It is definitely in my top 5 list!  :)

While some episodes are funnier than others, each episode has at least one really good laugh in it. The type of stuff that you spend the next few days giggling about whenever you remember the scene. I just really love it.

Hopefully, they will make a fourth season, since I already miss it.

Enjoy!",1250985600,9,412,4.311688311688312

While it centers around a small group of IT people, you do not really need to be a tech wiz to follow the comedy.  If you are, you will just catch an extra tidbit here and there.  It's mostly safe for kids, but not so much with season three - there are a lot of subliminal sexual comedy lines and also quite a few that are a bit over the top this season.  So funny though!",1463443200,2,496,4.020408163265306

One of the best episodes is #5 entitled Friendface.  Mocking MySpace and Facebook, Friendface shows how things blow out of proportion quickly on social media.  If this doesn't make you laugh, you're probably taking Facebook FAR too seriously.",1422230400,2,512,4.988235294117647

You will get so many laughs from the antics of Moss, Roy and Jen - and will probably admit that you've also told someone to ""turn it off and on again"" !!!  As we all know - a reboot will fix about anything !  But I digress....  BUY THE IT CROWD  - because you will love it.  I have all of the seasons on DVD even though they are also showing on Netflix.  But when Netflix is no longer showing them... I will not worry because I have my own copies !  This is one of the best shows ever.  Just wish there were more episodes.  Watch it and you will be hooked !",1390867200,,675,3.933333333333333

It does take a bit of getting used to since most North American shows are cookie cutter stuff that follows the same formula every week.  I've never seen a character anything like Moss. He must be a genius actor.

The show reminds me of Fawlty Towers.

If the DVD doesn't work than you should try turning it of and then on again and checking to see if your TV and DVD player are plugged in.",1363392000,,475,4.175824175824176

Clearly, this is one of the best comedy series on UK television, and was no doubt an inspiration to America's ""Big Bang Theory.""

You need to start with season/series one to understand the characters. We like to watch one episode a night; it clears away all the thoughts and worries.  I swear I sleep better afterwards.  If you are accustomed to watching US shows, you will think that the first season looks like someone filmed them in a basement, but you will still laugh.  Be aware that there are only six episodes in each season/series.  Also keep in mind that even though this is a TV show, there is very strong language.  I wouldn't watch it with the kids.

3919123,5,B002EOVX9W,"As I approach middle-age, In watching tv, i have witnessed many a tv show, both American, and from the UK.
This was recommended to me by a friend who claimed it was not just funny, but at times outrageous. At the time I bought this, Series 2 was also released, so i purchased both.
What a wise move.
The show is not as outrageous as was told, but is pure fun. I am still laughing at one joke, where the female boss of the IT department in a meeting of higher-ups claims that 'If you type Google within the Google site, you will break the internet'. Ok, is not as funny in print, but seeing it made my sides split.
Ross is my favorite. He is so hysterical, and what comes out of his mouth is so endearing, and all else that happens to the 3 employees of a business that has yet to say what they do believe it or not makes a classic tv show. Not offensive, and yet at times a little risque, you sense to be part of a family who work leisurely among those who think they know everything, but when it comes to computers, are clueless. It gives a new meaning to 'Is your computer turned on?'.

3919129,5,B002EOVX9W,"OMG, this series is so much funnier than 'Seinfeld' ever was!
 I watched this season (for the second time) last night and I was crying because I was laughing so hard. When Roy was taking 'geek porn' as an amateur photographer, that had to be the funniest performance by a comedic actor ever!

  The 'Internet doesn't weigh anything!' cracks me up every time, too. I just can't keep watching this - I have to save it and savor the humor again, after I recover from last night's watching.",1272067200,,486,4.488636363636363
3919130,4,B002EOVX9W,"The third series of The IT Crowd is the show's peak, in my opinion. Unlike American TV, British seasons are so short that one bad episode can really weigh down a season. That's why The IT Crowd: The Complete Third Season is the only DVD of a British show I've ever bought; three of the six episodes are funny, and the other three are completely hilarious.

Canned laughter is a negative and some of the humor goes too far into zany territory for my taste, but the cast and writing of The IT Crowd are great fun. I watched all three seasons on Netflix before getting this one to share with friends and family. I'm an IT guy so I expected this show to be a lot of un-funny pandering (think The Big Bang Theory), but I was impressed and recommend this to fans of British comedy.

3919133,5,B002EOVX9W,Series three of The I.T. Crowd is awesome. It's just as funny as the first two series and I can't recommend this show enough. This is one of the best British sitcoms in recent memory and it should not be missed. The episodes are really funny and entertaining and the features on the disc are pretty good. Graham Linehan's commentary is fairly interesting and funny and the blooper reel is hilarious unlike other series.

I have watched all 3 series on DVD, great price by the way on Amazon.
It took about 3 episodes into series 1 to get the characters establised and then it just takes off.
Have to watch two or three times because missed so much first time around because I was laughing so hard.
If you truly want to experience the english sense of humour at its best then buy all 3 series, and sit back and laugh. One final commendation, when my wife says ""it is too stupid to laugh at"", then you you know you are on to a winner, thats my bench mark.",1266364800,,606,4.016528925619835

Not all episodes are equally strong but when they hit - it's as funny as anything on TV. My favorite episode is when Moss (the nerdy guy) has software that teaches him some basic football expressions in a cockney accent so he can fit in and he and Roy try their luck making new friends in a pub. They get accepted by the wrong crowd and chaos ensues and very funny bits come one after the other.
One great episode doesn't make a show but there are enough laughs in the rest that I'd highly recommend this season as a starting point if you are unfamiliar with the show.",1266105600,,821,4.516778523489933

3919147,5,B002EOVX9W,"Here's a bit of reassurance: ""The IT Crowd"" has been staggeringly funny for two seasons already, and ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Third Season"" does not disappoint. The technonerds are still clueless, Jen's love life is still a wasteland, and Douglas finds ever more creative ways to run his company into the ground -- and oh yes, the Internet is destroyed.

Jen is horrified when Roy identifies a builder working on her home as a ""Builder From Hell"" who has a penchant for urinating in sinks; at the same time, Douglas uncovers an old revolver in his desk. Guess how  well THAT goes. Then Moss and Roy pretend to be ""proper men,"" hanging out in pubs with soccer fans... but when the ""proper men"" turn out to have some criminal plans, Roy ends up sandwiched in the middle.

Additionally, when Jen steps out for a brief job interview at another company, the IT department starts to fall apart -- Moss gets concussed (""Jen, can I call you back? I've just got Jen on the other line""), and Roy is ejected from the building after his jacket is stolen. And when Jen is selected as employee of the month, the boys decide to play a prank on her.

When the IT trio sign up for the networking sight Friendface, they find themselves reconnecting with some old friends and exes -- and Jen ends up dragging Moss to her school reunion as her fake husband, while Roy goes on a date with the Joker. Finally, Roy is enlisted to photograph a nude calendar to raise money for ""bosseyedness"" -- but after Jen convinces the women that it's sexist, he finds himself having to photograph some less attractive subjects.

Electric sex pants, nude calendars, screaming Japanese businessmen, near-death experiences (""That looked like Hitler!""), girls who look like the Joker, misfiring guns, and the Elders of the Internet. ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Second Season"" piles the increasingly bizarre problems on our already overburdened, underappreciated IT personnel. And while it's a bit more sitcommy than the season before it, there's a sly satirical edge to the comedy.

It still has plenty of brilliant writing, riddled with surreal situations (the electric sex pants!) and weird dialogue (""Revenge, that would be uppermost upon my mind! I'm going to wee on everything! I'm going to strain my personal potatoes throughout her premises!""). And while the IT department's social awkwardness is still the main theme, their problems have become even stranger with time (Roy ends up homeless on the streets, holding a cardboard sign that says ""I want to get back to work"").

The three main actors are still utterly brilliant -- Katherine Parkinson's Jen keeps falling afoul of her own technological ignorance (""How do you record? ROY?""), Richard Ayoade's twitchy Moss remains socially inept and twitchy (but has some shining prank moments), and Chris O'Dowd's Roy has to deal with The Joker, a gang of thieves, and the horrifying prospect of having to photograph naked old ladies (""... and the last one... has a gangrenous arm. But she still wants to do it!"").

Matt Berry also has a bigger role as the hyperdramatic, deeply oblivious Douglas -- he has a gun mishap, deals with the aftermath of Jen's sexual harassment suit, and has a torrid affair with a very unusual woman. Too bad Noel Fielding is absent from this season.

It's not QUITE as surreal and goofy as the second season, but ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Third Season"" is a staggeringly funny, slyly clever little show. I'm 99% sure you'll enjoy it.",1265587200,2,3481,4.827181208053691

IT Crowd has turned out to be one of the best series I've seen in the past decade. The writing is clever and sharp. The best part about this show is that it can be enjoyed by everyone. Just the other day I watched it with my (very) leftist Aunt, my (very) rightwing Aunt, my techy-nerd brother, and my sister who doesn't know the difference between a laptop and... uh... the larger one. The show's humor is so widespread and downright raw funny.

3919155,5,B002EOVX9W,"Maybe Season Three of The IT Crowd carried the burden of high expectations (at least as far as I was concerned). Seasons One and Two were hilarious and, judged by those pre-set standards, I couldn't help feeling that Season Three came out of the gate a little sluggishly.  Was creator-writer Graham Linehan (of ""Father Ted"" fame) coasting just a little?

The first four episodes - From Hell, Are We Not Men?, Tramps like Us, and Speech - all succeed on their own terms and have plenty of laughs.  But I've come to expect more from Roy, Moss and Jen.  Sure, I like the way each episode introduces a variety of disparate elements and then uses them all to great comic effect.  For example, when Roy gives a homeless guy 50p but criticizes his hard-luck story in episode three, we know that's a sentiment that will come back to haunt him.  As soon as Roy and Moss bluff their way into the hearts of some ""real men"" in episode two, we know there's trouble in store. And it's funny to see Jen take her employee of the month award so seriously - even putting an Oprah quote on her office door - in episode four.  Through the end of episode four, most of this season's surprises come from Douglas Reynholm (Matt Berry), the boorish boss who is forced to wear ""electric sex pants"" as part of a harassment settlement and gets to date a post-op transsexual, too.

The season reclaims past heights with episodes five and six - Friendface and Calendar Geeks.  The intro to the Friendface episode , with its takedown of social networking sites (""don't think about germs...""), is uproarious.  The episode pokes fun at all aspects of the social networking phenomenon in ways big and small, while staying true to its nerdy roots and its specific character quirks (for example Moss is mildly disgusted to be told his newly friended mom's ""current mood"").  Episode six starts with Roy finagling his way into the photography assignment for a nude charity calendar - only to see the assignment morph into something that could haunt him for life.

If you enjoyed Seasons One and Two of The IT Crowd, you won't want to miss Season Three.

If you're new to the show and want to sample a 22-minute burst, then start with Friendface and reboot from there.",1253491200,7,2230,4.601010101010101
