2060843,5,B000244E2O,"I used to have my tuesday nights very busy watching The X-Files and Millennium back to back. But Millennium was COMPLETE. I always felt for the characters. ""Roosters"" and ""Owls"" were some of my favorites episodes. It amazes me how the best show always end up being cancelled. Millennium was intelligent, well-written, dark, intelligent, dark and INTELLIGENT. The last episode was a disappointment, many questions left in the air. I wish they could make a mini-series finale where we could learn what happened with those wonderful characters: Lara, Peter Watts, Jordan (was she a key to something?)(Were they planning something interesting for her character?)If they are NOT going to film such a mini-series/movie, at least have some excellent storyteller write a novel which concludes the series. I will be the first one to buy it. Lance Henriksen plays Frank Black as nobody can. He was excellent for the role!",1085097600,,911,5.120805369127517
2060844,5,B000244E2O,"Millennium is one of my favorite television shows of all time.  Nothing out there has ever been able to compare to its well-written and thought provoking storyline.  Fox really let a lot of fans down when they canned the series unexpectedly, years ago, as we expected a possible fourth series that never showed up.  Fortunately, the series ended with a pretty decent final scene, but there are many loose ends that remain a mystery.  It's a shame that it took so long for Fox to release this on DVD.  Thought the first season of the series is definately my favorite, I sincerely hope that the second and third season get released as well.  I've seen every episode of the series (several times), and I look forward to watching it on DVD again.",1084320000,,742,4.583333333333333
2060845,5,B000244E2O,"I'm not normally one who jumps on the bandwagon with regard to the release of a particular televison show / series on DVD, but in this case I felt that I had to make an exception and chime in.  As with the others who have made their voices heard regarding the much-anticipated release of Season One of ""MillenniuM"", I also have been waiting a long time and with baited breath for its arrival.  Bravo, therefore, to Fox for finally having the good sense to deliver MillenniuM into the hands of those that so richly deserve it (i.e. the fans such as myself who have waited and waited and waited for its release); so too do I hope that the network has the sound judgment to release all three seasons for our future considerations, lest the journey we've begun should prove a vacant enterprise.  Thanks again, Fox.",1084233600,2,810,4.534246575342466
2060846,5,B000244E2O,"So Fox,have you noticed the saLes as of today,(...)  Looks like you had better start prepping seasons 2-and-3,eh? My deepest appreciation to Fox's Peter Staddon for pushing this title through,when,seemingly no one else at Fox gave a damn. A lot of major big budget movies don't alway get a sales rank of 6.let alone a ""cult"" series that has been,shamefully,off the air for 5-years!
  Chris Carter,I hope you are aware of this current ranking and that you feel even more validation for what was,overall,accomplished in this mindbending,groundbreaking series.
  Despite a slip,in Season-2,into silliness and camp-(though still better than anything else that aired at the time!)-your return to S3,ceatively,put the show back on track and into realms that were essentially unexplored in Television drama. Henriksen's performance through out the series,but epsecially in S3 is the stuff of legend. Nothing can compare.

Millennium was that other great show Chris Carter did besides The X-Files.
Millennium aired from the fall of 1996 to the spring of 1999. Three seasons of the series were produced, a total of 67 individual episodes.
Frank Black was played by Lance Henriksen and his wife Catherine was played by Megan Gallagher around these two people an interesting tale of paranormal events and paranoid conspiracies was intricately woven, complexly knotted, and all focused and ready to take some unknowable form upon the coming of the year 2000.
""Paranoia is just a kind of awareness, and awareness is just a form of love."" -- Charles Manson
For all three seasons we eagerly watched the adventures of Frank Black, a former FBI investigator, as the world tilted and twisted spinning closer and closer to the year 2000.
The first two seasons of this show were just beautiful though the second had several questionable miss-steps but kept it together as the pseudo mythology of conspiracies in the show were expanded on creating more and more darkness and paranoia and then came the last season which to summarize frankly tanked miserably.
As with other shows Chris Carter built he created a dark, deadly world and interesting, fragile and paranoid, edgy characters and after a while he lost interest and let other people kill the dang show by seriously messing up the story that was being told, with plot holes bigger than a bread box, and softening up the characters with cheap sentimentality, or out right killing off major pivotal characters.
Hmmm, sounds allot like the The X-Files does it not?
Poor Chris will he ever learn?
Between you and me the third season is only worth watching if you fall in love with the show during the first two. Otherwise although you can see them struggling to save the show let's just say the downward spiral had gone too far.
""Let us go in; the fog is rising."" -- Emily Dickinson, her last words, 1886
Anyway Frank Black and Millennium never made it to the year 2000. Unless you saw that X-Files episode which I refuse to acknowledge.
The show for all concerned was promptly sent to the trash heap of cable programming on the FX channel and forgotten by the FOX big wigs.
That hateful ripoff Profiler seems to still be shown in reruns on TV. But we hate that blond bimbo, she is no Frank Black.
I could go on more about my own fascination with this show, how the thoughts spoken and the dark visions still linger with relevancy and echo with teeth rattling truth.
How the shadows in this show are much darker and meaningful because of what they are not showing than any special effects could have given us.
I will not tell you about the episode Beware Of Dog that used a Carpenters song Close To You as the sound track to a murder of an old couple in a Winnebago by a pack of vicious, demonically possessed, wild dogs. Nor will I tell you how that one twisted, messed up moment makes me laugh every damn time, Nope not one word, I promise.
Just buy this DVD collection of the first season and I promise you some good-scary-fun hours of pure joy.

2060848,5,B000244E2O,"After years of waiting, after years of suffering through FOX DVD releases like ""Simple Life"" and ""Family Guy"" , we finally get to own the most daring show FOX has ever aired, MILLENNIUM. Why did this take so long? Perhaps it was the dark subject matter, or the fact that the show was ahead of it's time, and still is. Whatever the reason, I have never forgotten the power this show held over me. Lance Henriksens incredible portrayal of ""Frank Black"" a tortured soul that can ""see what the killer sees"" is very hard to forget. This premise has been very poorly copied many times since. Terry O'Quinn as ""Peter Watts"" created a strong counterpoint to the lead.
The very first episode titled ""The Frenchman"" but referred to as ""Pilot"" sets the pace of the show. Strong follow-up episodes include ""Lamentation"" ""Powers , Principalities, Thrones and Dominions"" and ""Maranatha""
Hopefully we will see the next 2 seasons as well. Episodes like ""The Curse of Frank Black"" and ""Midnight of the Century"" are quite possibly the best stories ever told on the small screen.

Special thanks to Peter Staddon for his continued struggle to bring this extraordinary series to DVD.",1083715200,12,1163,4.844221105527638
2060849,5,B000244E2O,"Chris Carter, asked by the Fox network to create a companion piece to his popular hit series The X-Files, pitched his pilot for Millennium early in 1996. Carter was eager to explore the other side of the horror genre. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully had spent years fighting extraterrestrials and monsters, exploring a world of supernatural horrors. Thus, Carter created Frank Black, a behavioral profiler who hunted more terrifying monsters, human monsters. Promoted for months in advance, Millennium premiered on Fox with the highest ratings of any premiere the network had shown in its history. Now, in the early days of the twenty-first century, this engrossing series has found a new following and, fortunately, the series has obtained the DVD release it so richly deserves.

Millennium, unquestionably the darkest network television drama of the twentieth century, had no rivals when it came to dramatic storytelling. Both the consistently high production values of the show and its philosophical subject matter made this series unique in the annals of television history. Frank Black's battle against darkness stunned viewers on intellectual and emotional levels. The series had no peers. Never before have episodic stories been so imbued with honesty, emotion, exploration, and experimentation. Millennium was successful on nearly every level of production.

Millennium developed over the course of three years and became one of the most powerful and unique drama series of all time. Frank Black's investigations were continually being shaped by a team of brilliant writers and producers, a talented crew, and an unforgettable cast of characters. The show has earned its spot in the annals of television history and will always remain prominent in the hearts and minds of its loyal fans.",1083542400,12,1797,5.368794326241135

2060893,4,B000244E2O,"Lance Hendrickson is absolutely great as Frank Black, a criminal profiler who consults for the fbi. It's written (usually) by Chris Carter, the man responsible for the cult classic series 'The X-Files'. This was literally his side project at that time, and as such fell victim to other writers stepping in and taking the series in a different direction. Just like 'The X-Files', every episode is either a Friday Night creature feature (in this case, serial killers and the like) or an episode that deals with a recurring story arc, this one being an underlying conspiracy theme (also, just like the 'X-Files'). Season 1 started out strong enough, got better, and then by season 3 almost felt like a whole different beast. I think it's because instead of dealing with so many generic/cliche killers, they started to showcase more 'unexplainable' phenomena, such as people who perform miracles, or people who have repeatedly avoided a sure death, etc. The series only ran 3 seasons before cancellation, and it's a shame they did. I would have liked to see the series creator return to the writing duties, Chris Carter came up with some great ideas in his day.",1422403200,,1157,4.908163265306122

If so WHY? Many of the former cast worked to distance themselves from this highly rated series that went on for years revealing many ""secrets"" of  paranormal subjects, known only to the small secret groups or those who have spent many decades researching the REAL clues such as in the masterpiece HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL.

2060897,1,B000244E2O,"This is the most boring, annoying TV series I have ever watched. It is filled with scientific innacuracy, fake Hollywood psychology, and melodramatic scenes. I actually fell asleep watching the first episode. The main character talks in a very slow, quiet voice, pausing too frequently after every word. He comes to conclusions using ""psychic"" powers, applying no logic or accurate psychological principles. There are several innacurate references to human anatomy and chemistry in the first two episodes. This is too terrible to watch. I really wish I could return this!",1410739200,,571,5.355555555555555
2060898,4,B000244E2O,"I like Millenium a lot, mostly for Lance Henriksen's performance as Frank Black. The show was a little ahead of its time in that it followed the adventures of a criminal profiler who had to use his powers of deduction to hunt down a new serial killer each week. What limits its enduring appeal is its focus on the Y2K hysteria (now long behind us) and its tendency to locate the source of evil in religion and metaphysics rather than clinical psychology. What I'm saying is, if Carter had changed the focus of his show only a little, Millenium could have become another Law and Order SVU or Law and Order Criminal Intent. Instead, it is a curiosity from the late 90's with a cult following.

But I continue to enjoy it for Henriksen's excellent acting. His commitment is consistent and excellent, whereas the writing and supporting actors are not. My favorites from the first season are The Judge, 522666, Weeds, Wide Open, Walkabout, and Lamentation.

Dead Letters has some very good ideas in it, along with probable echoes of Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, but I found the guest star to be bland in his role. Likewise, the pilot episode starts out well but then ends too abruptly. Numerous references to Yeats's The Second Coming aren't enough to save it. Gehenna invents fictional events that it links to awful and real violence perpetrated by real terrorists. I think it's squalid and opportunist for Carter to trivialize real-life suffering to prop up his weekly TV show. But hey, that's just me...

The other episodes range from mediocre to laugh-out-loud bad.

The extra features about the real-life Academy Group what influenced Carter's fictional Millenium Group are excellent but a little anticlimactic. The real-life investigators are refreshingly upfront about how unexciting and nonviolent their day-to-day jobs are. The story about the cyber-criminal who was hacking his ex-employer's web site to damage its stock price was my favorite.",1408924800,,1954,5.021604938271605

2060951,4,B000244E2O,"Frank Black (Lance Hendrikson), a former FBI profiler, takes a job with the Millennium Group, a private law enforcement consultancy firm that believes a cataclysmic confrontation between good and evil is coming, and becomes one of their top operatives.

This grim, atmospheric crime drama will be too dark for some tastes.  Frank possesses a unique insight into the criminal mind that allows him to adopt a murderer's viewpoint and make intuitive leaps about his motivations and intentions.  This may seem like a rather convenient ability for moving a plot along, but it also allows creator Chris Carter and his staff to keep a tight focus on the psychology of evil men without relying too heavily on forensic procedure, thus distinguishing itself from other crime dramas.  Hendrikson is the perfect choice for the leading role; his steadiness in the face of horror and his love for his family (Megan Gallagher and Brittany Tiplady) provide a bright spot in the darkness.  Terry Quinn also shines as fellow Millennium Grouper Peter Watts; he will get a lot more to do in the next season.  Standout episodes include ""Pilot"" (Frank's first case for the Group), ""The Judge"" (a man enlists ex-cons to kill for him), ""Lamentation"" (a pivotal episode that introduces the evil Lucy Butler), ""Maranatha"" (a possible Anti-Christ moves through the Russian underworld), and ""Paper Dove"" (a serial killer with mommy issues).",1344816000,,1412,5.14410480349345
2060952,5,B000244E2O,"What everyone else said. It's atmospheric, dark, self-aware, potent, and beautiful. Blah, blah, blah. You get my point. The crux of the show is about criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) moving with his wife (Catherine) , and daughter (Jordan) to Seattle. Frank intuits into the minds of serial killers. Black's only relief is between murders. When he's with his family. In fact, the yellow house they live in, is depicted in such a way - it symbolizes hope. Albeit hope from a cynic's perspective.  Seeing through Frank Black's eyes - it's easy to see why it may appear as a dream. An ideal, something never to be achieved - but something to keep your humanity alive when everything else says otherwise. How else does a serial profile convince himself life doesn't suck?

Yes, it's THAT depressing.

I personally like it because it lulls you in with Lance Henriksen's gravely demeanor, and it cushions the fall with questions, silhouettes, and deep longings for moral clarity. At times, the show may become exhaustive with its morose pace. There are no comedic ancillary characters, and very few moments of light. Everyone on this show is a freaking cynic. If you're a fan of The X-Files, you may not like this show. TXF has light-hearted dialogue, jokes, and a less-weighty feel to it.

This show? I feel like I need to see a therapist.

Few notes: The Pilot is mind-blowing, and check out the sweet, sweet cinematography!",1325894400,2,1435,4.864754098360656

While trying to maintain a life of normalcy for his wife and daughter, Frank Black's mind would be filled and tortured with imagery of the darkness created by the serial killers he profiled.

On 9/11, the real dawn of the new millennium, we all became somewhat like Frank Black and had similar visions of darkness torturing our minds while trying to maintain a life of normalcy.

On an intuitive level, the show was foreboding the mood of the world after 9/11.",1310601600,,612,4.754716981132075

2060956,5,B000244E2O,"I absolutely am so sorry I didn't give this show more of the 1 time watch, that who knows was probably in the middle of the season and was disjointed.  By complete luck and time to kill I saw it recently on a channel called Chiller.  I am actually very sad that I missed it, the first time around when it needed more viewers.  I am only partly into season 1 but what I love about it so far is the questions, yes, serial killers but why? So far have 1 episode that shows a child just thrown into a system, born to a teen druggie mom, and the child never did get a home....this show asked the WHY? why did they turn out this way, there was a comment made about how many children have suffered the same fate running around and we wonder why the world is so sick sometimes, I think Frank Black called it the thousand points of darkness vs light.

I think this show was too much realism for people, people don't want to think why someone ends up the way they are, we want to think they are just screwed up, and that its no one's fault, but early on in this season you see that the show is pointing out the why's and is challenging others to take up the mantel look around, take a stand, notice what is wrong, call it what it is, stand up for the weak.  One episode shows a well known well liked wealthy business owner father who has been molesting his daughter for years, the mother turns her back, and the daughter even conceives a child by the father, this is the kind of stories that just in the last 2 or 3 years that has gotten any national/international notice.  2/3 years this type of story makes headlines and Carter pens the story 12 years ago!

So far season 1 is dark, and daring you to open your eyes and I think most people really rather not think about other suffering, that some of these monsters among us were really made.  That money talks and often the well heeled get away with the worst of crimes because of their connections and people being afraid to challenge them.  This show was over my damned head back then and the truth is I was in my early 30's then and don't consider myself a shallow person.

After living some more life and working as a social worker seeing some of these monsters that society and their families have made, or denied they could help; this show tried to raise awareness and be a call for action, exposing some of the worse in society that was happening then and still happening.  Often times we turn on a movie or t.v. to forget and this show is a whole lot of REALITY.  It was ahead of its time, and we are worse for there only being 3 seasons, worse for the weird flip in the 2/3 seasons from all I have read this show lost its footing.

This show as much as I love, LOVE X-files and Mulder/Scully I mean I am still sad its gone, and pissed off that fans didn't go and watch the move in 2008.  Frank Black and Millenium was Classical literature to X-Files popular fiction novel.

Both brilliant but there is no denying the depth of the stories so far in 1st season as deep and dark, brooding drama, full of complexities that frankly at times can be hard to acknowledge.  I am totally with the bringfrankblackback website people it would be sooo wonderful to see the incredible Lance Hendrickson do some more of these movies, he just turned 70 years old, he is still acting and believe it or not would love to reprise the role of Frank Black.

I am truely sorry I missed this and wish they would bring Frank Black back while Lance Henrickson is still around and willing to reprise his role, even the girl who played his daughter Brittany Tiplady is still acting I saw her on a hallmark movie, she appears to be about 19/20 in the movie.",1273968000,,3875,4.289437585733882
2060957,5,B000244E2O,"One of the best things about this show is that it actually has some moments that frighten you. Sometimes these moments are the visual horrors (right there in front of your eyes), but most often, these are the moments when you come to the horrific realization of what you have just seen. For example, one of the best moments comes in the episode ""Lamentation"" when you come to an understanding about one particular character (I don't want to spoil it, so I keep this cryptic). All I'll say is that when you really start to think about this character (and how it was played), you feel chills up your spine! You suddenly recognize an evil that is an all-knowing, comfortable and collected, and always one step ahead of you kind of evil. This is the kind of show Millenium is and it is a solidly really good show, especially toward the end of the season after you've gotten an idea of who Frank Black is and the world in which he operates. By the end, you also start to feel the sanctity of the yellow house, but worry that the evil will somehow come and overwhelm it.",1259020800,,1064,4.406091370558376
2060958,5,B000244E2O,"Millennium was a TV series made in 1996 and sufficiently prior to the year 2000 to take full advantage of the effect of the upcoming millennium on the public's mind. In retrospect, I think it was one of the best series ever made and benefited from the experience gained by Chris Carter during the making of the X-Files. My friends who watched the series in 1996 said even though it was excellent they had to stop watching it because it affected their sleep! That was about the best endorsement one could give to this type of TV series.

Although intrigued by the topic I did not watch it in 96 as I had other fish to fry and other television commitments to keep, but I did rent it and ultimately purchased it from Amazon. I really liked this show and feel Lance Hendrickson was the perfect choice for the role of Agent Frank Black bearing the weight of the world on his shoulders. I also felt the role of his wife was essential for the series, and gave Agent Black a greater purpose and a place to recover from the debilitating effects of his job. I regretted the choice the writers made in killing her character.  This was a truly creepy series and I subsequently purchased the second and third seasons of Millenium. I felt that seasons one and two were the best of the three.

I recently watched the entire first and second seasons over again, and the second was darker and more twisted than I remembered from my first screening. There were major changes in approach and I now think the second season was the better of the two.",1253750400,3,1529,4.434163701067615

Unfortunately, it made the same mistake X-Files did and the plots just went too far overboard with all the conspiracy theory nonsense.  Millennium was at its best getting into the minds of people, and why they do some of the things they do.  Frank Black walks a tightrope dealing with it all.  Once they started trying to inject ""humor"" into the mix, as well as all the BS with the Millennium Group, it was all over.

2060983,5,B000244E2O,"""Millennium"" is one of the smartest, and most stunning, television shows I have ever seen. It's also one of the darkest. The first season deals with serial killers and mass murderers(the formulaic ""monster of the week"" is present). The purely adult content found in all of the 22 episodes may be too strong for some. To me, it's perfect. I haven't seen a network show with this much strong adult content since ""24"" and ""House"".

The brilliant Lance Henriksen stars as Frank Black, a crinimal profiler who joins the Millennium Group and investigates with Detective Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), Detective Keibelhouse (Stephen James Lang) and a partner from the Millenium Group, Peter Watts (the perfectly cast Terry O'Quinn). At home, Frank Black realxes with his wife, Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and their daughter, Jordan (Brittany Tiplady). The balance between the dark and gruesome realities of the outside world and the light and peaceful comforts of the Black Family's yellow house is flawless. But even the yellow house becomes infected with crime during the episode ""Lamentation"".

Each episode has its moments. My favorites are ""Pilot"" ""Dead Letters,"" ""522666,"" ""Wide Open,"" ""The Wild and the Innocent,"" ""Force Majeure,"" ""The Thin White Line,"" ""Walkabout,"" and ""Maranatha."" They are so full of suspense and some gory killings that your kids will have severe nightmares if you let them watch them (or if they watch them without you knowing it). The writers Glen Morgan and James Wong have done superb jobs with ""Dead Letters,"" ""522666,"" and ""The Thin White Line."" I don't really like what they did with the show in season 2, but the second season still manages to capture my attention.

As you can see, Chris Carter's ""Millennium"" is much darker and much more realistic than his ""X-Files,"" which is also a great show. I give this a 4.5/5.",1223251200,,1844,5.059210526315789
2060984,5,B000244E2O,"Frank Black is my hero.  As played by Lance Henriksen he posesses an insight into the minds of the most demented killers.  He knows the evil that resides in the human heart and his time worn face shows it.  Yet he still holds on to the hope that he can make a difference for his wife and little daughter, protecting them from the all too real human monsters that seem to be appearing more often in the modern world.
  Where do serial killers come from?  Is there some real evil entity, a ""devil"" if you will, that helps create these people without concience who can kill without remorse?  Could the serial killer phenomena be part of something bigger at work?  Frank Black begins to wonder.
  And as this series unfolds, (especially in season 2) it is apparent that the Millennium Group has some ideas on the topic as well.  Frank Black works for them as a consultant in Seattle, Washington.  In fact, Frank and the group find a great number of killers who believe they are playing some part in the apocalypse as described in the book of Revelation or the writings of Nostrodamas.  Not all of them, but these people obviously see things ""differently,"" and it's Franks job to see what they see so he can catch them before they kill again.
  That is the intriguing premise, and maybe it wasn't as accessible to some as the UFO mythology of the X-files, but they missed out.
  Was the show dark?  Certainly.  But it was brilliantly acted and directed too.  Each episode is better than most movie thrillers about cops vs. killers I've seen.  I'm not dumping on The X-files.  I was a fan of that show too, but really the first season of X-files was sort of uneven (see my review of that boxed set).  Millennium was top notch from season one.  And season two was even better.  I think Chris Carter must really be proud of this show.  He and everyone involved, Lance Henriksen, ALL of the actors, the producers, the music of Mark Snow...it all adds up to a landmark show that deserves it's due.

Lance Henriksen always pleases...but the sickly-sweet, artificial nature of Frank Black's home life makes me want to throw up...especially since it seems to add nothing significant to character or plot development.

Police are inept; Frank shows up; Frank gets psychic vision that never leads him astray; everyone around Frank accepts psychic vision unquestionably, including people who have just met him (and the audience is never given any depth of insight as to why this happens); mundane killer gets caught; insert odd bit of why-can't-we-just-get-along philosophizing which is occasionally good and you get Season One.  Not to compare TOO much with The X-Files, but Millenium has none of the depth, none of the existential doubt or questioning - OR character charisma - that made the X-Files so engaging.

2061011,5,B000244E2O,"The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. Between 1996 and 1997 the X-Files creators made a new type of television show with the same high quality production values called Millennium.

At around 950 minutes per box, you are looking at 3 boxes with approx. 47 hours worth of viewing. So you have 2 days of non-stop Millennium if you get the whole collection. Millennium finished in Season 3 in 1999, a 3 season span is still considered a very good run (when compared to most television shows that only last a season) but paled in comparison to its contemporary X-Files parent than ran for 9 seasons and one movie. There is also one crossover episode with the X-Files. It should be seen last after the end of Millennium Season three and is found in the X-Files Season seven, episode four: Millennium.

The X-Files creator Chris Carter wanted to concentrate on human evil rather than just the paranormal and so developed the idea of a new show with more adult themes than what his mainstream creation, the X-Files, was doing at the time. This meant that instead of aiming at a teenage and family audiences Carter would create stories about extreme iniquity aimed squarely at adults. The result is a very dark, scary and often mind shattering experience. You don't enjoy Millennium, you go through with it.

Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is a former homicide detective turned private investigator with the Millennium group who hunts killers using his special profiling techniques. The series is set during the end of the 1990s and is focused on the end time events as expected by apocalyptic cults in the run-up to the year 2000. While working on individual cases Frank Black is sometimes teamed up with members of the Millennium group such as Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn), works alongside Lt. Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) and often talks about his work with his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher) and entertains his daughter Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady), both who are being threatened by a mysterious serial killer at large whom Frank cannot trace. Most episodes play along with the theme of Frank Black being called to investigate a case only for his family to become involved while he is trying his best to keep them away from what he does.

The DVD case is nothing special but more importantly the six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically Millennium is sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are usually 4 episodes per disc, and 6 discs in total for a grand total of 22 episodes (last disc has only 2 episodes). There are no commentaries and no bonus material. They could have at least provided us with the Millennium remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Millennium: Season one is as hard as adult dramas can get. It frequently contains sex related crime themes and horror. In many ways the show is more disturbing than expected coming from its X-Files production background. Millennium is devoid of any humour, is often very squeamish and many episodes push the psychological boundaries beyond disturbing. While some episodes are somewhat tame on the gore and psychological peril, other episodes are the kind you wished you never saw. When Millennium pushes the tension factor up it usually decides to go well beyond the 10. For this reason you never know if the episode you are watching will be an interesting one or an episode that just suddenly turns very nasty without warning. It is hard to imagine another television series that hit as hard as Millennium did when it was first aired.

Season one of Millennium is about the Millennium group, cults, troubled profilers, priest murders, body parts, serial bombers, funeral murders, incest, security systems, child kidnapping, sins, rape drugs, related suicides, copycat killers, kidnappers, filicide, hallucinogens, prison escapees, Satanism, animal mutilations, the apocalypse and matricide.

The most popular episodes are Gehenna, The Judge, Weeds, `Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions' and Maranatha. Broken World stands out as probably the most edge-of-your-seat thriller episode that Millennium has to offer. Lamentation has a shocking twist.

Overall Millennium is certainly not for everybody. Even some fans of the X-Files will find that its core theme of sex crimes and violence is as far from Mulder and Skully as you can get, however if you like the production values of the X-Files then Millennium is just that and then some more. Not many people will want to get inside the head of Frank Black but if you find that a tough gritty crime thriller series is your cup of tea then it doesn't get much tougher than Millennium.",1185926400,15,5475,4.8985976267529665
2061012,5,B000244E2O,"I remember watching the ""Millennium"" premiere way back in `96.  I would've had to have been twelve at the time, and though I'd watched ""The X-Files"" from the very beginning and had long had a predilection for horror-oriented entertainment, ""Millennium"" proved a bit much.  The pilot. . .disturbed me.  As did the next episode. And the next, and pretty much every episode I watched of it at the time. Nothin' but serial killers, so it seemed, and the lead was apparently dead as well. It was all just too damned depressing, and I watched it less and less over time.  Nevertheless, it did make a strong impression on me, and I never forgot it.  Still, I didn't think about ""Millennium"" too much for many years, but with the recent DVD revolution, nothing  is going to be forgotten or unavailable for very long, and I recently got through my long-overdue viewing of the first season.  I must say, I'm quite impressed.  At nearly twice my prior age, it doesn't even have a shadow of the original impact, but ""Millennium"" is still an impressively dark, gruesome TV show, particularly in its first season.  And, more to the point, it's just flat-out good.

""Millennium"" focuses on one Frank Black and his family as they move to a new home in Seattle.  Frank is a former profiler for the FBI, and this move represents a new beginning for him, his wife Catherine and their young daughter Jordan.  They live in a cute little yellow, suburban house in a picturesque neighborhood with friendly neighbors seemingly transplanted from a `50s sitcom.  Still, as a killer-hunter, Frank is intuitively in tune with the darker side of life, and he can't escape it.  He hasn't really abandoned his old occupation anyway, and he now works as a consultant with the Millennium group which basically amounts to continuing work as a serial killer profiler, but with a, well, millennial bent.  They think that the increase in violent, disturbing crime a symptom of the impending apocalypse, though we don't hear too much more about this during this season.  As it turns out, these elements work best when they're just under the surface, adding a subtle, binding element to the season as a whole.

It's difficult to define just what makes ""Millennium"" so effective and so different from most everything else on TV.  It's not one thing, but rather just the overall milieu of the show, an accumulation of a thousand different details.  ""Millennium"" is an admitted ""Seven"" cash-in, and it generates the bleak tone in much the same way, with darkened corridors and endless rain, with biblical and general religious themes, both overt and covert, with a contrast between an idealized, middle class life and the degeneracy of the world as a whole etc.  This final contrast is an aspect which I particularly enjoy.  For whatever reason, the ideas of both utter purity and total depravity particularly intrigue.  Perhaps we don't have much of either in day to day life, at least not in suburban, middle-class American life, but that just makes it all the more interesting I guess.  Still, when it comes to looking at light vs. dark,  ""Millennium"" is much more intimate with the dark.  While it's not shocking the way it once was, ""Millennium"" still proves to be easily the darkest show I've ever seen on network television or non-premium cable.  Though we don't get to see most of it it in much detail, we've got plenty of bad stuff: eyes and mouths are shown shut while the victims are still alive; families are slaughtered while the children are forced to watch; clergyman are burned and tortured alive; teens forced to drink the blood of others; organs are stolen from still-conscious victims etc.  And that's just a small taste of the unremitting grisliness of the show.

Lance Henriksen's performance as Frank Black is the key to ""Millennium"".  Henriksen doesn't seem to have a whole lot of range, but what he does he does well, and this show contains some of the best work I've seen of his.  He has to walk a thin line, since Frank is a quiet, largely humorless and cold figure, but Henriksen still imbues him with a certain amount of life, and never makes him seem bored or indifferent.  He isn't dull, but intense and thoughtful  Megan Gallagher is Frank's wife Catherine, and she's not as good, though  still adequate.  Her relative weakness is probably more a fault of how her character was written than how she was performed, but it's a concern either way.  She's just a bit of a drag and a worry wort, frankly.  I'm not sure what Frank sees in her, honestly, though it may have something to do with her being 20 years younger than him.  (Way to go Frank! Put those psychic profiling powers to good use!)  Still, even if I don't especially care about her as a character, I buy that Frank does, and that's good enough.  The other recurring characters are mostly cops, of sorts, and most of them don't make too strong of an impression other than Terry O'Quinn as Peter Watts, Frank's major contact in the Millennium group.  He's not as prominent this season as he'd become, but he O'Quinn still gives nuanced, sympathetic performances which adds a bit more life to the show.

Truth be told, I have a hard time coming up with specific standout episodes.  They are all pretty similar, for the most part.  And no, not every episode deals with a crazed killer of some sort, but most of them do.  The ""Pilot"" is still particularly effective, with plenty of nasty ideas, though it is perhaps a bit too obviously derivative of ""Seven"", even as this show goes.  I also especially like ""The Wild and the Innocent"", one of the more unique, episodes, involving a young couples murderous trek across the south in search of their stolen child, and ""Lamentation"", an episode which initially looks like a typical ""Silence of the Lambs"" knockoff, but which moves in unexpected directions and helps bolster the supernatural angle of the show which steadily comes into greater play as the season progresses.  On the plus side, part of the reason why there aren't many particular standouts in my book  is because there are no obvious dud episodes either.

On the downside, ""Millennium"" doesn't maintain this quality forever.  Season 2 sees Carter cease to be much involved, and the show moves in a less bleak, more conventionally ""X-Files""-esque direction with some rather bizarre plot developments.  It's far from bad, and perhaps this formula would wear thin after a while, but season 2 is still not as good as the first.  Still, this is what we've got, and it's more than good enough.  Hell, it's pretty surprising that they were able to keep it this unrelenting morbid for as long as they did, so we should consider ourselves lucky to have this much.  Anyway, it you're a fan of pitch-black, horror themed entertainment, you'd be pretty damn stupid not to check out ""Millennium""",1181692800,12,6838,4.760611205432937

Sometimes it's like comparing Angel to Buffy! Buffy is great, groundbreaking, fantastic but there are episodes of Angel that are just unbelievably amazing! Same goes for Millennium!

First, there's the writing. Chris Carter was channeling some amazing juju when he came up with the show. The episodes he writes (and many of the other ones) are tight. Almost perfect examples in great TV writing! Secondly, the mood. The whole show is about atmosphere. It's about descending to another level for an hour and just surrounding yourself in a great, creepy story. This is done by lighting, cinematography, editing, and Mark Snow's great soundtrack! Even Mark goes one better from the X-Files and delivers truly fantastic and mood-setting music. Lastly and most importantly, there's the acting. Lance Henriksen is so believable as Frank Black. He utterly makes you believe. Megan Gallagher and a younger Terry O'Quinn (with hair!) make for a amazing cast. But it's all about Lance! He's the reason that you watch.

Working for the Millenium Group, a collection of ex-law enforcement officials, Frank takes what seem like everyday cases, and as a result in trying to save the world from these creatures of the night, allows them to seep in through his front door.

While watching some episodes are slower than others, they each have their very strong points. Each episode deals with a different issue and form of darkness. No matter how TYPICAL the episode seems or starts out, there's always some terrible truth lying not ten minutes away that Frank must deal with. Can he catch all the monsters? Can he protect his family from evil? Will his daughter inherit his terrible gift of being able to see what the killer sees?

Watching each episode back to back is a treat! Yes, it's dark, images are haunting and at times the pain (emotional, I mean) really carry over to the viewer. Some images maybe graphic, but overall they hold to the 'less is more' and I think it adds the the suspense. Maybe it was too intense 10 years ago, but watching it now - it's a shame the show was ever cancelled.

Season 1 creates the world of the Millennium Group as well as tears into Frank Black's life. The grip on reality he tries to keep with his family and home as a shining light. Lance Henriksen is powerful as a good guy trying to solve puzzles and hunt the bad guys/girls down. He reminds me of a modern John Wayne, and I mean that as a sincere compliment.

That's just a setup for what follows.  With only a few TV-cliched mis-steps thereafter, the series goes on to a sequence of modern-day horror that is more intense than ever on TV previous (and since for that matter).  Taboos are broken and the viewer will be shocked at times--and how often in this jaded world can you say that!!

2061039,5,B000244E2O,"10 years after it first premiered ""Millennium"" is finally beginning to receive the kind of recognition it first deserved. Chris Carter's second creation after the highly successful ""The X-Files"" is a brilliant look at evil and the kind of madness present in our world. The show only lasted 3 seasons and it wasn't cancelled due to low quality, it simply could not compete with it's big brother. ""The X-Files"" is easily the most influential, popular TV drama of the 90's, but ""Millennium"" is now beginning to really flower with the kind of cult status that has saved countless movies and TV shows from being forgotten. Lance Henriksen is a masterful casting choice as Frank Black, a retired FBI profiler who now works with the Millennium Group, a consulting group that helps with serial murder cases but believes the world is edging over so closer to an unclear apocalypse. The concept in 1996 was intriguing, especially since the actual millennium was only a few years away, but now in the post-September 11 world it's downright frightening, since one year into the millennium a horrific terror did in fact come to pass and the world has completely been turned around with wars brewing and cultures clashing. A total apocalypse? Probably not, but not exactly things that should be brushed away. Shining episodes in Seasone One include the acclaimed ""Pilot"" episode which Carter still states best represents what he wanted to do with the series and ""Weeds,"" a powerful story that shows how violence and terror can still find it's way into the most pleasant-looking society. With ""Millennium"" Carter uses fiction to touch upon a frightening reality which is that people have forgotten what evil is or that it even exists. Science and liberalism have made people try and discard the idea that true evil exists, and as much as science has been a blessing, there are still terrible things in the world we simply cannot explain with any secular means. Black has been cursed with the gift of being able to look into the killer's mind and see the terror. The production credits of ""Millennium"" are superb and with it's haunting music by ""X-Files"" maestro Mark Snow, stellar scripts and edgy cinematography, ""Millennium"" is one of those special shows produced with an eye towards the cinematic instead of just regular TV. Had Carter not been tied down by his growing responsibilities to ""The X-Files"" (including the making of the movie in 1998), ""Millennium"" would no doubt have found better footing. Here is one of the great TV dramas, lost but now re-discovered by a growing fan base that will bring to it the kind of respect it deserves.",1142553600,5,2631,4.901345291479821

The first season introduced us to the world of Frank Black - a dark world highlighted by the light that he found in the love of his family. The cases he consulted on were grisly, and terrifying, but also interesting and in some sense, spiritual.

2061056,5,B000244E2O,"Created by Chris Carter, ""Millennium"" first appeared on television in 1996. It stars Lance Henriksen as Frank Black, a former FBI Agent who specialised in profiling serial killers. Frank retired from the Bureau after suffering a breakdown and moved from Washington to Seattle. His wife, Catherine, is a clinical social worker and the couple have a daughter called Jordan.

Although no longer an agent, Frank hasn't completely severed his ties with the world in which he once worked. He has joined a team of ex-law enforcement agents known as the ""Millennium Group"". Little of the Group's history or structure is given away during the first season, though it does appear to be well connected and has access to a great deal of information. However, only very few members other than Frank are introduced - his main contact is Peter Watts, played by Terry O'Quinn. Nevertheless, those who work for the group appear to be happy to lend their expertise to whatever investigation requires their help. A cop in Seattle before he joined the Bureau, Frank occasionally works with Bob Bletcher - a friend and former colleague at the Seattle PD's homicide department. Given Frank's experience, the bulk of his work continues to focus on suspected serial killers. He also has a very useful gift that helps with investigations. When, for example, he visits a crime scene or views a body, Frank can see what the killer saw - something he describes as both a gift and a curse. However, he is not supposed to be a psychic, nor is his ability supposed to be a form of telepathy : he was simply a very gifted individual who could 'put himself' in the killer's head.

In addition to the pilot and the twenty-one episodes of season one, there are some special features on the sixth disc. It's always nice when the extras aren't just out-takes, and the team behind Millennium have clearly put some effort in. There are commentaries on the pilot and another episode (""Gehenna""), though two of the documentaries (one on the making of season one and another on the creating the logo and the title sequence) were what I found most interesting.

Given that Chris Carter also created ""The X-Files"", it's perhaps a little unusual that - for this season at least - there isn't anything unusual about the show ! Carter wanted to create a murder-mystery show with a cohesive idea, but without a paranormal thread. Unlike its more famous sibling, ""Millennium"" didn't feature alien autopsies, werewolves, liver-eating mutants or 'black oil' : with only occasional exceptions, the villains are human serial killers. (Although there simply isn't a bad episode, one of the strongest and saddest - ""The Well-Worn Lock"" is one of these exceptions. It sees the action largely driven by Catherine and features a criminal who isn't a killer). Carter has created a show that is dark, can be disturbing and has a real sense of evil. Highly recommended for fans of murders, mysteries and thrillers who aren't squeamish.",1118102400,7,2974,4.896825396825397
2061057,5,B000244E2O,"Millennium was one of the better television series to air in the nineties. For creator, producer and writer of many of the episodes, Chris Carter, (The X Files) this was a canny and timely show with the hysterics of Y2K spreading across the world, and the many people predicting the end of the planet by the year 2000. For many, this well-made series fed and played on our apocalyptic fears, using the occult, religion, torture, death and destruction as its main themes. For most of us, thankfully, the international computer networks did not fail, and the world did not destroy itself - at that point in time, anyway. However Millennium was extremely well written and produced, and the writer's certainly did their research, delving into biblical prophecy and the many legends and folklore of the esoteric, giving the series a solid credibility that endures today.

Frank Black is a retired FBI agent with a gift. He is not your standard ""profiler"", using his psycological knowledge of the human mind to then `enter' the mind of an evil killer. Frank goes a step further, and as he confesses in the pilot series, he has the cursed gift of actually ""becoming"" the evil he so often seeks. He ""knows"" evil and experiences it to the depths of his soul. That's why so many of the evil characters in the series can `recognize' Frank Black; they know that he knows, they often see him as a type of kindred spirit, and as a result, relate and open up to him when other's cannot even get close. To contrast this gift, Frank has a loving home life, a beautiful and understanding wife and lovely daughter. Jordan is a miracle child, as she wasn't supposed to happen, but there's a twist - Jordan seems to have the gift as well, which causes some interesting problems as the series unfolds.

In the first season, the viewer is introduced to the Millennium Group, an organization consisting of ex law enforcement, consulting various local police force agencies on particularly difficult or bizarre cases. Frank is a member of Millennium Group, who on the surface seem to be forthright and transparent in their capacity, however, as the series continues, especially once the second season begins, the organization becomes more mysterious, conspiratorial and dark, and not as straightforward as we were first led to believe.

This is a six-disc set containing 21 episodes. Depending on personal taste and sensibility, some episodes are better than others, but all of them, to my mind, maintain a high quality in terms of direction, acting and overall production value. If you are a Millennium fan, this collection is a must, as one can simply pull it off the shelf occasionally and enjoy time and again.",1111536000,9,2689,4.828633405639914

Lance Henrikson was superb in the role as Frank Black and his wife and daughter are superbly cast, The same can't be said for the support roles, While there acting is not poor it can sometimes be shown up by a superb actor such as Lance.

If your an X Files fan then do your self a favour and take a look at Millenium, It is much darker and the content more disturbing and real, But you will not be dissapointed.

This is truly one of the finest series in many many years, It's just a shame it lost it's way in later series and lost some of the die hard fans that desprateley wanted it to soar to the heights the X files reached.",1110844800,5,839,4.23125
2061059,4,B000244E2O,"I was 13 when ""Millenium"" premiered and there were certain things I couldn't understand. This series isn't for a 13 year old. I was very excited when the series came out on DVD, and now as a 21 year old I found this ""Millenium"" a harsh, gritty series about a tortured man and his ability.

If you didn't know already, the series is about Frank Black, an ex-FBI agent who specializes in sexual homicide. He now works for the shady Millenium Group who are retired FBI, CIA, etc. Frank sees what the killer sees (literally) and his ability helps solve cases and find murderers. The story later arcs into an end times/Nostradamus background, and it works.

This is a severely gritty and at times gory series. The pilot episode features people being buried alive and being bled for the satisfaction of the killer. If anything, this series accurately shows us how a serial killer works (if you're into that kinda stuff). You'll see severed body parts, demons, gruesome murders - all stuff that you might not have expected on TV in '96-97 - but, if you've got the stomach for it, you'll find it very rewarding. There's little to no continuity in the series - it's all about Frank nabbing the killer from episode to episode.

Lance Henriksen (Frank) has the voice for the part, and constantly leads and takes over every show. He's an underappreciated actor and deserved his Golden Globe nod for his portrayal of Frank. Megan Gallagher and Bill Smitrovich play adequate supporting roles as Frank's wife and friend/detective. Still, the series is all about Frank and his ability.

There are some stand out episodes, most that come during the second half of the season. ""The Thin White Line"" is my favorite, where Frank must go back and talk to a serial killer that murdered some of his fellow agents 20 years ago while he worked for the FBI. Meanwhile, the killer's former bunkmate is on a killing spree. Episodes like that are incredible. The second season changed the story arc totally, focusing more on the Millenium Group, but season one is a great setup season and really sets the mold for a series like ""CSI.""",1110672000,6,2105,4.696476964769648

Sure you do. . . ever felt compelled to slow down to see a wreck on the highway?  MILLENIUM is not, and should not be, an easy watch.  It's violent; it deals with the darker side of humanity and its potential (and even inclination) for depravity; and as much as possible, given that it is a TV show, unblinkingly presents these issues.  But none of this is gratuitous.  Some of the best of this show takes place in the home of Frank Black (Lance Henricksen) and his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and very young daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady).  The contrasts between what Frank Black does to support his family and his life at home with them are most poignantly presented and some primal issues are raised:  how do you rear a child into a world of horror that you see so deeply into?  what do you tell her?  how can love survive in this world?  how do you keep insanity at bay?  how do you deal with the contrasts themselves?  Indeed, to watch MILLENIUM is to willingly participate in voyeurism, and in that respect the show isn't all that different from any other.  Frank Black lives in a voyeur's hell.

2061071,3,B000244E2O,"It is easy to see after viewing the 3 seasons why this show was then cancelled even if was done by Chris Carter of X-Files and 9 seasons fame. Do not get me wrong the show is quite good and addictive but it turns to too much different things in 3 seasons. The atmosphere is X-Files (no wonder with Chris Carter directing and Mark Snow doing the musical score) so if you like X-Files you are going to like this. However as said too many changes from season to season more than likely lost the audience on the road.

The first season is probably the best (Chris Carter left after...) as it is a dark murder mystery investigation show. Character well defined and well acted. Also the problem Frank Black has reconciling family life with a wife and daughter with his work investigating serial killers and the very evil of humanity is well shown. The millenium group at this point is nothing out of the ordinary only ex-law enforcement agents consulting on particular crimes.

The second season after Chris Carter leaves takes definitely a total different twist. The murder investigations take backseat to the mystery of the millenium group. A lot of mystical and religious elemnts are introduced and also ""funky"" episodes like 'Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense' or 'Satan Got Behind Me' that do not quite fit with the nature of the show and are to say the least distracting. All in all not as good as the first season but still enjoyable. One more thing the last episode is not very believable and is not really explained well in the third season. Warning spoiler----> Frank's Wife dies in this episode.

The third season then it turns to 'X-Files Mulder & Sculley wannabe"". Frank is back to FBI is paired with another female agent Emma Hollis but no chemistry like Mulder and Sculley, the episodes turn also to look X-Filish but without capturing the spirit of X-Files.

2061072,5,B000244E2O,"'Millenium' was one of the finest shows in recent television history.  Created by 'X-Files' mastermind Chris Carter, the show ran on Fox for, sadly, only three seasons.  'Millenium' was one of the grittiest, goriest, and most disturbing shows ever on a network station.

The show is filled with violent imagery, symbolic meaning, lots of murders, and a little yellow house.  This first season is basically a murder-of-the-week type format, but along the way bits of the series mythology are slowly dropped.  This mythology would become the series' story arc over its final two seasons and the series moves away a bit from the one-serial-killer-per-episode.

Lance Henrickson is simply stunning as Frank Black.  Henrickson rises above his B-movie roots and creates one of the most interesting and complex characters I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.  His performance is fabulously understated and completely believable.  Henrickson's performance makes you believe that Frank Black could be a real person.

The only knocks on the show are occassional gaps in narrative and Frank's extremely annoying wife and daughter.  But all the good points outweigh the bad ones.  This was one of the best shows on television, but it was ahead of its time and unfortunately was canceled after three years.  This first year is a wonderful lead-in to the the stellar second and third seasons.

So all I have to say is this:  Frank Black is a pimp.",1105228800,4,1434,5.068376068376068
2061073,5,B000244E2O,"I remember when Millenium aired, I wasn't really excited of it, mainly beacuse X-Files was on the spot.

A couple of years later, I got the opportunity to actually sit down and enjoy one of the episodes of season 1, and I had to agree that I missed a wonderful show.

Millenium turned out to be a thriller, in the same line that X-Files, but with and amazing storyline, and more developed characters right from the beginning. The way Frank Black was portrayed by Lance Henriksen was superb, and even the secondary actors and actresses were very good. The show threw us in the middle of some investigations (much in the line of the now popular CSI) but instead of going scientific with all those amazing gizmos they use to recreate a crime scene, Frank's gift was the ability to create a profile of the criminal and from there solve the crime. And is exactly this gift what gives the show such an intense deepness, when you are shown what Frank is putting together in his mind.

The Millenium group starts at the beginning being some contacts and friends for Frank, with almost no interaction with the story or any indication of what is the essence of the group which is perfectly fine for the first season, as it gives more detail to Frank's life and the lives of his family, his wife Katherine (Meghan Gallagher) and his daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady). The execution of each episode is magnificent, as you are always reminded of the essence of the show, which is the presence of evil, and how this evil afects the people who embraces it. And this is presented in a beautiful way by the interaction of Frank with his work as a profiler and his life as a husband and father.

I have waited a long time to see this DVD. It is amazing that even thought the show aired on 1996, you can still feel is fresh. It's quite exciting to look at the flashes and flashbacks Frank has and see how similar they are to some of the newer shows. The couple of documentals on the DVD are very good, and the ability to explore each episode individually is greatly appreciated. The pictures chosen for the intro of the DVDs is quite good also, and is very interesting to see some of the other extras. And they come with the original dubbing to other languages.

If you want to very critical about it, you may feel there were some other stuff that could have made it into the DVD, like some of the art and some of the original posters and ads could have been included in the DVD for printing.

But if you just want to watch the show, and enjoy the creepiness and mystery of it, this DVD set is for you. For those fans who saw the show in the past, it is a pleasure to actually see it become a reality and I can asure you, you won't be disappointed. For the people who have never seen the show, do yourself a favor and go and buy it. the storyline of the first season is so compeling and deep that you will be hooked to the story of Frank and the Millenium group.

When you finish watching it, you will want to buy the Second Season straight away.",1104710400,5,3028,4.339222614840989

I have watched all but the extras on disc 6, but as yet I don't know what preparation Henrikson did for the character, but I sure would love to know, since everything I have seen by Henrikson, and some recent TV  work, has been just brilliant.

Lance Henriksen was masterfully cast as Frank - an Atticus Finch sort of guy who lives most of his life in the shadow world of psycho-predators; taking rest and recreation with his lovely wife and daughter in that bright yellow house.  The series was masterfully shot, the writing was captivating. Each Friday evening was like going to the cinema for a 60 minute feature - I looked forward to each and every dark and disturbing episode :).

When Fox cancelled it, there was no going back to the swill trough.  This was the finest most thought and emotion provoking show I've ever seen.  I'm not much of a TV watcher, but I loved everything about Millennium- everything.  If the subject of the End Times interests you at all, or if you're on some kind of personal quest to understand evil in the world, I think the character of Frank Black will give you some inspiration, maybe even some hope.  That's where I'm at.",1097798400,2,631,4.589285714285714
2061092,4,B000244E2O,"Chris Carter likes to make TV shows about The Truth. 'The X-Files' of course dealt with the truth about aliens and UFOs. And MILLENNIUM is his look at the nature of evil. Whether humans are responsable for creating it within themselves and others or whether there is a higher (or should I say ""lower"") power at work.

Overall, MILLENNIUM is one of those shows I just have good memories about. Whatching a new thriller every week, it was great! But then years later after buying this box set and watching the first few episodes I found myself wondering if my memory was right or not!

The first half of Season 1 of MILLENNIUM shows the direction creator Chris Carter was really after. A weekly drama featuring serial killers with a design in the vein of films like 'Se7en' and 'Silence of the Lambs' trying to figure out what drives this men to such pure evil. The problem though is that serial killers can get quite old after we've since been exposed to shows like CSI. Sure, MILLENNIUM was first, but we're watching it on DVD here. So after 10 episodes in a row of serial killers is this an indication of what the rest if the season, and the whole series is going to be like? The answer is HELL NO!

In the second half of Season 1 it seems that some producers realised that they needed some variety - or maybe it was just that they felt more in comfortable with the characters letting them experiment a bit. But MILLIENNIUM finally kicks into overdrive and mostly drops finding serial killers and starts taking advantage of the emotional connection we have with the characters.

Starting with Disc #4 we get into the episodes that feature doomsday cults and more emotional content instead of the unknown victims and killers of the first few discs. Sure there are still killings, but it's a lot less formulaeic and there are actual subplot arcs which start here including one that may reveal why there are so many killers living very near Frank and his family! Something to do with the true face of evil perhaps? ;)

The image quality of the DVD seems to be mastered from video masters and because of the long runtime, the compression is a big higher than normal. This means that a lot of the time you'll get little instances where the image degrades because of a fade within the show. All that happens is that details become blocky and straight lines become jagged. I am pleased to say however that I noticed it becomes less common in the later episodes.

The sound is simple stereo tho it serves it's purpose. Surround would have been better but I doubt it wouldn't be worth the money for Fox to remaster all the episodes for a not-so-popular show.

The extras are alright. They do have a couple of commentaries (sorry, haven't listened to them yet) and a couple of featurettes. The documentary on making MILLENNIUM Season 1 goes for 48 minutes and tells the basic story of how it was developed and features interviews with key creative people like directors and writers talking annecdotes in the context of some key episodes. NB: Notice how the interviewees refer to Morgan/Wong episodes a lot, but those two guys don't feature in this documentary. They are who took control of season 2 and made it all supernatural despite what Chris Carter wanted.

The other featurettes are one on real life profilers and a talk about the logo and title sequence by the relavent designers. Okay, but not enthralling. Also on my copy is a behind the scenes look at the recent movie Aliens Vs. Predator. Just promo for Fox I guess.

Overall this season served as a great preface for the(...)SECOND season (due out early 2005 by the way). Started slowly but really got me in the second half with some riveting writing and direction.",1097539200,3,3718,4.612708018154311
2061093,5,B000244E2O,"I started watching Millenium about mid-way through its second season and became hooked. The character of Frank Black, the mysterious Millenium group, and the nature of his work all fascinated me. Unfortunately I never was able to see any re-runs of the first season and so I found this DVD set welcome indeed.

22 episodes (including the pilot) and a few extras provide literally hours of quality viewing. Millenium is dark, yes, but it also is very strong on the human drama of its protagonists, secondary characters and even the villans. This makes the episodes more re-watchable than say, CSI (another show that I love dearly).

I would also like to add that the show has aged well. I showed Millenium to some of my younger siblings who were intrigued by the show (although one found it quite frightening). Since then they have described contemporary shows as ""being like Millenium without being scary"" or ""its like if Millenium was trying hard to be cool"" (I won't mention which shows they were talking about).

All in all I was very satisfied with this set and eagerly await season 2.",1096848000,2,1089,4.781914893617022

Now if Fox will just go ahead and offer years 2 and 3 then I will have a lot of great viewing. If you love or like this series then this year one release is waiting for you.

I was therefore eager to get my hands on 'Millenium' for the first time when I purchased the DVD season 1 set - but I've got to say it's very hard viewing.

Again the quality of the filming and production is superb but the stories are just so unrelenting bleak and depressing that watching just a couple of episodes wanted to make me put any comedy on the TV that I could get my hands on. At one point I rang my Mum out of the blue just to see if she was ok (she says ""thanks"" Chris by the way). The whole thing is just SO down-beat.

It made me realise how clever the X-files structure had been to throw in the occasional 'funny' episode. Millenium has a message and I see to break it up would destroy the point the creators were trying to make but - at the end of the day - it's supposed to be entertainment, not something that makes you want to either kill yourself or lock the door and think about never going out again.

Like I said the series is superbly done (the acting is riviting from all - especially from Lance Henriksen as Frank Black) but I really do miss the little grey guys and monsters.

Para los pocos afortunados que contbamos con el canal FOX las noches del viernes se convirtieron en un lujo. Esta es la razn por la cual una de las mejores series televisivas no se popularizo en nuestro pas, haciendo tcnicamente imposible adquirirla en las tiendas de Mxico.

Este DVD-BOX se compone de seis piezas, conteniendo los 22 espectaculares episodios de la primera temporada, y como material adicional 3 documentales, el primero dedicado a la filmacin de la primera temporada de la serie, el segundo es una mirada a ""The Academy Group"" el grupo de ex-agentes del FBI que asesoraron a la produccin e inspiraron la creacin del grupo Millennium, y la tercera esta dedicada a la creacin de los ttulos y logotipos de la serie, tambin cuenta con la galera de comerciales de la primera temporada de la serie. Cabe sealar que los DVDs son regin 1, y que el material adicional esta disponible nicamente con audio en ingles, pero los captulos cuentan con subttulos y audio en ingles, espaol y francs.

El creador de la serie es Chris Carter, el mismo de los expedientes X ""The X-Files"", personalmente esta ultima serie no es muy de mi agrado. La historia gira en torno a Frank Black, un ex-agente del FBI, el cual posee la habilidad de poder ""ver el mal"", no como un vidente, sino viendo el mundo de la manera en que un criminal lo ve. El personaje de Frank Black, interpretado por Lance Henriksen no es presentado como un hroe sobrehumano, sino como un ser que se desenvuelve dentro de un ambiente lleno de crmenes, intentando que su vida personal y familiar no sea afectado por este, convirtiendo su don tambin en su maldicin.

La actuacin de Lance Henriksen no deja un sabor de boca muy agradable en el primer episodio, pero logra adaptarse al papel de manera extraordinaria a lo largo de los primeros episodios, prueba de esto fue su nominacin al globo de oro.

La serie va desde profecas apocalpticas, asesinos en serie, fanticos religiosos, hasta la presencia del demonio en persona, recordando la prxima llegada del milenio y la creencia del fin del mundo.

Esta por dems decir que la serie cuenta con un alto contenido de violencia, tanto como una serie de televisin lo permite. Si eres fantico de pelculas como Seven, El Silencio De Los Inocentes, Copycat, esta serie no debe de faltar en tu coleccin.

2061118,5,B000244E2O,"How do you make a great, scary television show? Well, here is a recipe for success. Take a pound of flesh from the 1995 movie Seven, with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, add a little demented serial killer from 1986s Manhunter with William Peterson and Dennis Farina, and place it in an industrial sized microwave oven for a few minutes. Then add a slice of 1991s Silence of The Lambs. Add some fava beans and pop the cork on a nice bottle of Chianti and you have the hit Fox TV series that ran from 1996 to 1999. Years before TV shows like CSI or Cold Case Files and Law and Order SVU were even thought of, there was this remarkable show. It was called MillenniuM.

  MillenniuM was a series about a profiler named Frank Black. He could see into the mind of serial killers and offered us a glimpse at the world of the criminally disturbed. He worked for the Millennium group, an investigative firm that worked in the private sector. Every week, violent crimes, as well as the disturbing images they create, were the primary focus on this great series. The first season was superb. We all got to meet and know Frank, Catherine, and Jordan, who lived in their big yellow house in Seattle, WA, and we could almost feel the dampness and heavy rain that Seattle is famous for. However, after the haunting opening theme and the awesome boomp-boomp that led us into each segment with the white screen, we all immediately looked to the bottom of that screen to read the type-writer font, and see where this weeks episode was taking us to. We would usually meet a member of the Millennium group within the first 15 minutes, and usually that character was Peter Watts. Looking like a Marine and always in control of his emotions, he quickly learned to trust Franks feelings on most issues. These two made an excellent team, as well as the others from the group. These relationships really made the show.

Frank also had his demons, as all great heroes do. He was in search of a way to suppress his gift, for the love of his daughter, who may also be cursed with the visions. Frank was also working on his marriage, which was, as most marriages are, a daily battle. Frank Black was uncomfortable with his chosen profession, but he also knows it was his destiny to do this job, which he did so well. Thats enough about the show. If you are reading this review, you are already a big fan. Lets talk about the DVDs.

 Besides the fact that I want to tell Fox, thank you and its about bloody hell time, this DVD set is great. All 22 episodes are in crisp, clear and in vivid color, and that awesome theme song before each episode. Sweet!  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a Chris Carter fan, as well as CSI fans and any fan of current TV programs that review evidence and solve crimes. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed.

Thanks,

Dark, moody, bleak, violent, grim, disturbing.  It's hard to understand how it got past the broadcast TV censors and made it onto prime time.  Most R-rated horror movies you can see on cable aren't this scary.

True, the third season went south over creative differences and direction of the series, but Lance Henricksen turned in a masterful performance every week the show aired.  His authority couldn't be questioned.  The man IS Frank Black.  And you would never in a million years want to be in Frank Black's shoes.  Why?  Because in addition to the horrors he faces with grim determination, he cares, which means as the viewer you come to care too.  The effects of caring in this series are devastating for Frank and the people around him.

Without a doubt, the best crime thriller series to date in the history of television.

It's too bad this series fell one year short of the true millennium before leaving the air.  But fans of the show will be pleased to know that a ""virtual season"" of twenty-two scripts can be found on the web that treats the reader to the final round of Frank, Jordan, and the fate of the world.

2061142,5,B000244E2O,"Thank God for intelligent television shows like ""Millennium."" As any fan of this dark yet compelling show already knows, Millennium is a bleak, gritty and gruesome show, but not entirely without hope. Hope is a constant message in this show, the hope that Good can triumph over Evil, and that Man, with all his flaws, is still capable of selfless acts.

The most striking thing about Millennium isn't the graphic nature  of the episodes, which are unnerving and striking. It is the sheer intelligence and suspense created in each episode that lasts in one's memory long after the last disc has been played. Chris Carter, the late 90's Rod Serling, has to take most of the credit for having the strength and courage to create an intellectual show with such raw and disturbing subject matter. How he got this show on the air to begin with is a minor miracle.

This is not an easy show to watch, as the horrors depicted are quite graphic. What is rewarding is watching venerable actor Lance Henriksen at his finest as the tortured Frank Black. A thousand exhausting and terrible events lie etched in his craggy face. He bears the eyes of a man who has seen too much, and cannot unsee these horrors.

Overall, a creepy, moody existentialist masterpiece. Television today, with few exceptions, is relegated to moronic and mindless fare in the form of so-called ""reality"" shows, truly the sugar-high of the masses. A recent news article lauded the extreme success of television shows released on DVD. The reason being is the lack of quality television programs today, while excellent, smart television entertainment is a thing of the past.  Kudos to Fox Studios for releasing Millennium on DVD.

2061145,4,B000244E2O,"The first season of Millenium was amongst the greatest seasons of any show ever on television--bar none. Gruesome, yes, but ringing with some of the best writing anywhere, and from Lance Henriksen--a brilliant portrayal of a haunted and broken man. For one brief moment Chris Carter could do no wrong.

But man did that moment crash and burn!

Please permit me to rail for a moment, and then end with what I feel are some salient and timely remarks:

Let us begin by never forgetting what was once within our grasp--truly creative shows (like the X-files and Millenium) that as part of network television gave the public at large strong stand-alone stories while trying to forge them into larger narratives. This has been lost to us now. Worthy shows, those like Six Feet Under and especially Carnival, still carry this on--but for a price on premium cable.

Why has our culture at large turned away from that which makes us think for periods of longer than sixty minutes? Is it like the vast turning away from Christianity that has not been tried and found wanting, but rather tried and found hard? Perhaps.

But just perhaps it is yet another symptom of a culture ""on the move."" Perhaps even the water-cooler phenomenon has been absorbed and left behind by the ever-consuming but rarely producing ""mobile society."" Even protracted narrative is becoming too intrusive in our increasingly insular lives.

We have found it too jarring, to disconcerting and have therefore slammed yet another drawer shut in our lives of compartmentalization. As children of the Most Creative, shutting out the creative is just one more symptom that shows how far we are from what we were and are made to be. What a shame.

It does not help that neither Millenium or the X-files finished strongly. I would argue that Millenium, for all the possibilities the initial concept had, fell hardest. The final episodes of the X-files S-U-C-K-E-D, but at least Reyes and Doggett had some good story lines before Carter and the gang gave them a disparate and unworthy Cheers-esque send off.

Yet the success of shows like Six Feet Under, Carnival and The Sopranos should be a wake up call to the culture mongers at the big four. There is power in story. There is living water still left in the well of creativity.

This first season of Millenium proves my point. No matter where this show ended up (as part of one of the weaker X-files episodes ironically) it was great in the beginning. Hence the four stars.

It is not about eating bugs or getting voted off the island. It is about being creatures made in the image of perfection. Imitation is not about flattery; it is what we were made for.

The first season of Millenium is amongst the most creative things ever to have been on TV. It may give you nightmares or make you look around corners a bit too much, but I give it a strong recommendation. I'm glad its finally on DVD.",1092009600,10,2901,4.690944881889764

  Frank Black was a man cursed with a horrible ability to see within the minds of human monsters.  He continually wrestled with demons from within and without, grounded by the love of his family.
  The weekly excursions into the heart of darkness turned off some viewers who were unwilling to venture there but enthralled others who were willing to take the trip.  Three of these episodes have haunted me since I first saw them back in 1996 and 1997: ""The Pilot"", ""The Thin White Line"" and ""Lamentation.""  At its best, ""Millennium"" was the finest hour on televsion.  It is a series that I sorely miss and thankfully the first season is now available on DVD.

2061149,5,B000244E2O,"In the 1996 fall TV season, Chris Carter --- at the height of The X-Files success --- decided to take a gamble and come out with another drama series. What he ended up releasing is Millennium. This series takes the conspiracy and monster-of-the-week formula of The X-Files and lets it run. This series is about serial killers and mass murderers. They are the monsters-of-the-week. There's no aliens or mutants, just normal looking individuals who have a few things missing in the head.

It stars Lance Henriksen as a burnt-out former FBI profiler (agents who delve into the minds of serial killers to figure out how they tick in order to catch future killers) named Frank Black who has resettled in a quaint and quiet neighborhood of Seattle, WA. But whatever caused him to retire from the FBI hasn't stopped him from helping police agencies on the behest of a private law-enforcement group called The Millennium Group.

Each week, Frank is called in to help in a murder investigation that has the look of a ritualistic killing. This series really pushes the boundaries of whats allowed on TV with some of the very disturbing images they show on each episode. The images are not gratuitous since it helps the viewer see what Frank sees. It also helps explains how such images and thoughts can numb a person to the degradation and evil all around them. I would be burnt-out just like Frank is I had to see those things in my head all the time. But with the help of his co-workers within the The Group, he prevails and stays out of the abyss for one more day.

Lance Henriksen's Frank Black is the series. Lance seems perfect in the role of Frank Black. The weathered, lined face that seem to have seen more than it should have and his low, gravelly voice makes Frank Black his. I cannot see the Frank character being played by anyone else.

Millennium is a series that takes abit of daring to watch and sit through. A series about looking into the minds of serial killers is not for everyone, but should at least be tried. The acting and writing is top-notch. The perpetual doom of the night scenes and the sunny dispositions of the day scenes at Frank's yellow-painted home makes Millennium one of the better-looking series to date. Chris Carter took a daring chance with this series and I think he succeeded. I recommend this series for fans of The X-Files. It is a much superior series to the other serial killer drama, The Profiler.",1091491200,6,2435,4.62962962962963
2061150,5,B000244E2O,"Chris Carter was made famous by the X-Files but there is something much more ""real"" about Millenium. The supernatural/religious/apocolyptic/mass murder plot twists and constant two to three (or more) story lines are simply amazing.

 Lance Henriksen deserved an Emmy for this role. His ability to convey strength and determination when faced with overwhelming circumstances, and to turn around and show such love and compassion for his family is amazing. No actor could have done better in this role, or ""looked the part"" any better. The lines on his face seem to have been earned by years of trying to deal with his ""gift, or curse.""

 This is truly one of the best shows I have ever seen on television, and without a doubt never received the attention it deserved. I think the harsh subject matter may have been more than many people could stand, but any big fan of suspense/drama with a bit of horror thrown in would love this series.

 My only hope is that all the seasons and episodes become available and are in sets as nice as this one. Worth it's price many times over.",1091491200,5,1077,4.702127659574468

Sometimes it would get into the supernatural but even then it was more about what we as human beings are capable of. Seriously creepy stuff and without an R rating (though sometimes I wonder how).

 Of course, Lance Henriksen was born for this role. He's an actor capable of exuding great warmth but also can give a look that says ""If you only knew what I know..."" Lance is the man. It's too bad he never received a personal Emmy for this role.

 Even though this isn't really horror, horror directors everywhere should watch this and take notes. Hell, any director could learn from this. This is a series that began and ended at the top of it's game, even if it came a little too soon.",1091404800,4,820,4.446666666666666

Created by X-Files creator Chris Carter, Millennium stars Lance Henriksen (you've seen him before in Pumpkinhead, Aliens, Terminator, Near Dark, and he's in the upcoming Alien VS Predator) as former FBI profiler Frank Black who has since moved his family to Seatle.  There, he joins the mysterious Millennium group: a seemingly group of crime busters who investigate some mysterious and brutal crimes.  However, just like on Carter's X-Files, nothing is as it seems, and Carter weaves a web of conspiracy that it soon becomes clear that Frank doesn't know who he can trust.  Henriksen is perfect in his Emmy nominated role, giving what very well could be his best performance ever, and he managed to keep doing it every week until the series' end.  At the time the show premiered, Fox was turning out new shows every season to be a double header with the X-Files (remember Space: Above and Beyond? or Strange Luck?), most of which lasted shortly, but Millennium lasted for a good few seasons until it's ultimate end.  All in all, die hard fans of the show can now rejoice that Millennium is finally on DVD.",1091318400,22,1269,4.693693693693693
2061176,5,B000244E2O,"Highs:

It's about as cryptic as I remember from my `96 encounter with it and it still has a lot going for it in terms of being something cutting edge for television. Some of the content is difficult to stomach let alone realize it was on TV*. (*See the Pilot)

Lance Hendrickson has that `instant credibility' that is missing from exactly 99.99% of current television. He is a great lead and simply has the exact chemistry the show demands.

The imagery of the show is so unique it is in and of itself a work of art. How many shows could you turn the sound down on and simply `experience`?? Few. Current shows? None.

Megan Gallagher is also a plus, she is beautiful and simply seems at home in the confines of the set. `Jordan`, the daughter is also pretty good at times, but seems to be a bit young for the show. Terry O' Quinn, ahh, the Stepfather return-eth! Great. I love this guy a lot too. The villains are also almost always up to par, which is crucial to a show of this nature. Love the Judge!

Fair extra's, wonderful packaging (much better than the awkward-flimsy-cardboard X-files-junk), the price is spot on, and it has great picture and sound. Wow, I still can't believe I own this!

That there weren't 15 or 20 seasons of the X-files to be made for DVD or this may never have come out... (did all 9 seasons @ $1?0 a pop, really need to come out before this superior show...?)

Special kudos to the young actress who played the young mother in the episode which should have been titled simply... `Angel.' I didn't take the time to find the name in the credits but she really is gifted.

I OWN SEASON ONE OF MILLENNIUM!

Lows:

Few. But here goes...

Ok, the casting seems a bit stiff in terms of the people Lance (Frank Black) works with. They seem fairly `typical TV show' cardboard cut outs. Stiff cop types that seem more like human road blocks/speed bumps than actors, the X-files seems to suffer from this same problem. ""I don't know Frank...."" You'll hear a lot of... even though he's always right!

Most of the shows are fairly `anti-climatic'.

As much as I love Frank and Katherine separately I must say the chemistry between them is generally lacking. It is serviceable, but often flat. More like a cool professionalism than a marriage. I can understand the character Frank being dark, but there just should be more moments of levity, probably more the writers fault than the actors. The show needs to be somber but that approach is often taken to an extreme.

Waiting another Millennium for season II!

In Conclusion:

If you are even on the fence about this show, don't be. I often have `romantic' notions of old shows I used to watch that sometimes don't pan out (I won't even go into the Land of the Lost DVD fiasco), but on the strength of Lance Hendrickson alone, this is a worthy buy on all counts.",1091318400,44,2830,4.476653696498055

 MILLENNIUM punches you in the chest with ""possible reality"" in a world all too seasoned to chaos. You will feel fright like never before watching some of these episodes. Chris Carter has an out of this world gift for touching nerves of true horror within you. The seemingly impossible catasrophes are shown to be quite possible, and you'll come away from each show wondering if it ever ""really could be""...In the first season, viewers get to know Frank Black and his family. We learn about his work in the FBI, his move to Seattle from D.C. where he wants to start fresh on a road less littered with crime and ugliness. Alas, what would the show be without these things!?

 Frank soon becomes involved in one grisly case after another, helping the secretive Millennium Group solve some pretty weird crimes through his gift of sight through the killer's eyes. We feel his anguish as he witnesses murders too horrid to relive, and we empathize with his inner fears about losing his family to a psycho from his past.

 Lots of out of this world concepts, blood and gore, creepy devilish story lines...this first season was risque for tv at the time, and by the time the show had its finale, we saw just about everything shy of an NC-17 Rating on television. I hope the rest of the seasons are released soon, because you'll watch this set in a week if you're a die-hard fan like we are. Six DVD's in all, plenty of special features, including behind the scenes making of the pilot and interviews with the primary characters.

I used to watch the show religiously when it was on, and I'd slowly watch my friends and family get turned off by it.  The first season was too slow for some, the second too gory, the third, well, you'll have to wait and see.  But people couldn't keep up with the harsh reality of Chris Carter's world.  They all regret abandoning the show now that it's on DVD, and they've begun watching it again.

Yes, they quit watching because the show was hard.  And yes, the show is hard.  It makes you think.  It makes you feel.  It sets up characters, often to kill them off, and make you miss them.  Why watch, then, you may ask?  Well, when's the last time a show made you feel?  Made you sad or angry or worried or made you simply get up and lock your door?

If you want more sappy crappy TV to slide down your throat like everything else in our fast food world, walk away and hit some sitcoms on the big three networks.

The 2nd half includes a great supporting cast (including the serial killers), the movie-like feel to each episode, the music by Mark Snow of X-Files fame, and the consistency of great episodes with only 3 or 4 of the 22 being average.

Part of my decision to try the Millennium 1st Season box set was its very reasonable price - and after watching the first two discs, I have to say I made a very good investment.

 The show has the complexity and feel of some my favorite big-screen thrillers, such as Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, Manhunter, and others - and with its gory detail and realistic depictions of brutal violence, Millenium clearly tests the limits of what one expects to see on television.  Lance Henriksen is ideal in the role of empathic profiler Frank Black, who comes across stylistically as a more mature, sensitive and somber version of Manhunter's Will Graham.

 I can't think of another television show to this point that dared to delve quite so deeply into the shadow of the human psyche - and unflinchingly show us the stomach- (and heart-) wrenching evidence, on-screen. Combining The X-Files' exceptionally high cinema-style production standards with brooding, thoughtful crime drama, Millennium provides a satisfying, intense viewing thrill that isn't for everyone - but is well worth experiencing for those who like their horror, sci-fi and crime programming very dark and intelligent.",1090886400,2,1308,5.122065727699531
2061200,5,B000244E2O,"Millennium was, and remains one of the scariest TV shows ever. It had an air of creepiness that permeated the show for its entire run. Some shows can do this for an episode or two, but to do it over three seasons is quite an accomplishment. Frank Black, a former FBI agent just wants to escape that life and moves to Seattle with his family. But Franks ability for not only profiling serial killers, but to put himself in their heads, soon leads him to the Millennium Group, and the apocalyptic approaching year 2000.

 Lance Henrickson was perfect as Frank Black. His perfectly downplayed, even morose character fit the tone of the show perfectly. He was certainly a hero, but one who no longer wanted a life of pursuing killers and even WORSE things. Terry O'Quinn, a marvelous character actor plays Peter Watts, Franks contact with the Millennium group.

 Throughout its brief three year run the show would consistently make for outstanding, spine-chilling TV. There has been nothing remotely like it since. Towards the end of the final season Frank even had a crossover with Mulder and Scully from the X-files.

 The set comes with all season one 22 episodes. There is commentary on two of the episodes and a few other features. Personally I would have loved to have had commentary on more than two episodes simply because I found this show and its characters to unique that I wanted to have more insight into them.

 Season One Highlights

 The Pilot

 Frank Black, his wife Catherine, and their daughter Jordan move to Seattle. When Frank reads of the murder of a peep show dancer, he goes to the Seattle PD to meet with Bob Bletcher - Frank used to work Seattle Homicide with Bletcher before joining with the FBI. Frank has insight on the case - he has the ability to place himself in the mind of these killers. When another victim is found, Frank helps leads them to a buried coffin marked with the word Peste. Peter Watts, of the Millennium Group, whom Frank is consulting for, examines the dancer's body and finds a needle prick. Frank analyzes a video tape from the peep show and is able to pick out the words the killer spoke as he watched the dancer - verses from Yeats, the Bible, Nostradamus. He believes he is fulfilling prophecy.

 522666

 A crazed bomber, who gets sexual pleasure from watching his creations explode in public places, leaves the phone tones 522666 as his signature.

Peter Watts helps out and finds that Fabricant married a pen pal, Lucy Butler. Lucy insists she has not seen Fabricant. While there, Lucy gets email that contains reference to Frank's home address -- he calls Catherine, who is safe. He asks her to look in the mail - photos of an Asian judge are in an unmarked envelope. Fabricant walks into a hospital drenched in blood - someone removed his second kidney. Catherine finds it in her fridge. She sees a woman in her house, who looks like Lucy.

 Broken World

Chris Carter is never one to pull punches on a commentary as we have witnessed on a couple of the XFILES discs. Here he and David Nutter extend a much deserved thank you to the cast crew, as well as bringing new light to the material. After sitting through the first two episodes again I am blown away by the level of detail and care that are evident on the screen, seemingly every production descision was lovingly and thoughtfully made. The cinematic essence is especially inescapable in the first season. Like a diamond its flaws may be more evident for its near perfection, but this has to be the one television series that was most harmed by the commercial interruptions.

2061206,4,B000244E2O,"Chris Carter's first follow up series to his hit ""The X-Files"" used a concept that would have seemed right at home on his other series; as the Millennium arrives, it seems that strange things are beginning to happen and that, maybe, these strange things represent some sort of conspiracy that will, ultimately, lead to the end of the world. Frank Black, former profiler, gets called back into service to help the Millennium Group which is to Black what the FBI is to ""The X-Files"". These bizarre occurances include kidnappings, serial murders with unusual circumstances, ritualistic sacrifices and many of the other things that Mulder and Scully might experience themselves. Except that Black begins to notice strange things happening within the Millennium Group itself suggesting that it may be playing a part in the larger scheme of things.
Much darker in tone and set on the west coast (as opposed to ""The X-Files"" primary setting in Washington DC), ""Millennium"" had a strong first season with Carter working with many of the folks that contributed to the strangest and darkest episodes of ""The X-Files"". My only complaint is that ""Millenium"" tends to take less risks than ""The X-Files"" by turning genre conventions on their heads and playing with the very format that it works within.
That said, ""Millennium"" didn't have as much time to grow up and it did so in a very public forum whereas ""The X-Files"" rose from obscurity to become a powerhouse series. Expectations were high for this fine series and comparisons to its sister production put ""Millennium"" at a disadvantage for most critics. Borrowing the look, feel and texture of David Fincher's ""Sev7n"" and combining it with the tone of its sister series meant that comparisons were going to happen.
Lance Henriksen (""Aliens"", ""Near Dark"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") plays Black with an edge just poking up beneath his calm, placcid surface. His anchor to reality and sanity are his wife and daughter. Terry O'Quinn (""The Stepfather"" and ""The X-Files: Fight the Future"") plays Black's ""boss"" the person that Black reports to throughout the first season.
Priced just right (unlike ""The X-Files"")""Millennium"" looks quite good on DVD. The dark look of the series can be a challenge for transfer to DVD particularly when four episodes reside on each disc but the transfers look detailed with sharp image and nice contrast as well as solid blacks. There are some digital artifacts (due to the compression used and the high level of detail in the dark images) but they aren't distracting. We get a couple of nicely done commentary tracks that discuss the challenge of producing this series and a couple of nice featurettes that enlighten fans a bit more about the genesis of the series itself.
A nicely done set that will wet any fan's appetite for more, this is the first of set of the three seasons that will appear on DVD. Hopefully Fox will include the concluding one hour episode that aired as a part of ""The X-Files"" so fans of this series (who might not be X-fans)can have the closing chapter of the show.",1090454400,2,3075,4.915384615384616

They come in 6 slimline cases, which are packaged inside a larger slipcase, overall a very attractive set.  One thing I found kind of dissapointing was the lack of a widescreen presentation.  You either have to watch a stretched fullframe, or just watch it with the little bars on the sides, which is much smaller but gives a better picture.  Also, the soundtrack is Dolby Surround, no Dolby Digital or Pro-Logic is available.  The transfer is pretty decent, but does show some artifacts and shimmer at times.

2061221,5,B000244E2O,"Simply put, this show truly showed the dark side of man, and what one man can do to make a change in the world. And all the consquences to his sacrifices.

 Simply a Amazing show. Frank Black, serial profiler, joins the Millennium group to stop the ever growing evil in the world. And as the show progresses, layers upon layers of drama and suspence unfold. Are these ever growing acts of evil a sign of the comingn Apocalypse?

 No show will ever match the mood/atmosphere. It is unfortunate the show was cancelled after 3 years, but, I am sure Fox still kicks itself since no other show has matched it's viewer #'s since it's cancellation. Buy this DVD now!

 ""If I see in the darkness it's because there is light, and it is the light which guides me now,

 the light that will not go out,

 that will lead us out of the dark night,

 if, we let ourselves feel this too."" -Frank Black",1090281600,3,886,4.335365853658536
2061222,5,B000244E2O,"""Noah was an insane man, until the rains came, and that day the flood began. All the people who had jeered showed up. Imagine that scene--the chaos, the violence. People who had taunted Noah just hours before, now willing to commit any vile act... to secure a seat on his boat."" -- Iron Lung Man, ep. 13 FORCE MAJEURE

 Very few people understood what Millennium was about, but for its fans, it remains a very stirring drama. A lot of critics misrepresent Millennium as some kind of gloomy police drama, when the cases that Frank Black investigated during the course of season one were merely vehicles in which to explore the grayer shades of humanity.

 Only about half of the twenty-two episodes during the first season were concerned with just serial killers--far less than critics like to think. Look closer and you'll see that episodes like the pilot, ""Gehenna,"" ""The Judge"" and ""Sacrament"" had supernatural/apocalyptic elements to them, which make them far less mundane than some might initially think. (""Gehenna"" even had visuals of a winged beast, or Legion as the fans dubbed him, descending from the sky.)

 Regarding those other, say, eight or ten serial killer episodes, Millennium addressed the big questions: What made these men? What can society do to stop them? You won't hear the investigators on CSI or Law & Order ask these questions, unless in a glib, sarcastic way. Those programs are all about police procedure. To me, *that's* depressing. When Frank looked 'into the minds of killers,' he was trying to understand them, sometimes even sympathize with them. These killers weren't evil people. They were tragic people that did evil things--most were victims themselves. Millennium gave human faces to ghastly perpetrators. (I recommend Rick Smith's reviews for analyses of individual episodes: [...])

 The latter season one episodes stray from the serial killer motifs. ""Force Majeure"" involves a man in an iron lung who preaches about a planetary alignment that will have cataclysmic consequences. ""Walkabout"" sheds light on Frank's past when he participates in a clinical trial for an experimental drug that might suppress his 'gift.' ""Maranatha"" takes Frank to the Russian district of New York in pursuit of Yaponchik, who may be the Antichrist. And then there's the stunning ""Lamentation""/""Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions"" two-parter, in which devils and angels aren't merely a concept, but physically exist alongside Frank and his colleagues!

 Millennium also isn't relentlessly gory or downbeat. Look at the endings of ""The Well Worn Lock,"" ""Powers,"" or especially ""The Wild and the Innocent""--still one of the most uplifting hours of television I've seen to this day. A lot of the show's early work is about criminals taking responsibility, victims learning to heal, and how Frank, and his family and friends, come to an understanding about Why Bad Things Happen. Don't be so dark, critics. Millennium--seriously!--is not.

 Season two of Millennium is nothing short of brilliant, but the foundation is laid here. Strong scripts, talented actors, exceptional production values, and timeless themes (the tolls of work on family life, humanity's struggle with evil, temptations of the Devil, faith and religion, corruptions in governments and organizations) make all three seasons of Millennium a MUST BUY. Don't let mistaken critics, or lackluster DVD sets (a show this rich needs more commentary!), dissuade you from owning one of the best shows of the 90's, nay, of all time.",1090281600,27,3520,5.232682060390764

I loved pretty much every episode.  I can remember FAR more from 3 seasons of Millenium than 10 seasons of X-Files or any other show.  This 1st season will hold me over until (hopefully, prayerfully) the 2nd and hopefully 3rd seasons come out!
  The episodes I remember the most are ""Angel"" from the 2nd season, the Pilot, Gehena (sp?) and the episode where the Angel of Death dies in place of Frank's daughter.

2061253,5,B000244E2O,"Chris Carter's ""MILLENNIUM"" was the greatest show in the history of television: PERIOD! This brilliant, ""Silence of the Lambs"" like weekly TV show on Fox was original, fresh, vibrant and frightening.
On October 25, 1996, Fox Network premiered Carter's latest vision (during the beginning of The X-Files' Season 4). The pilot saw the highest ratings of any Fox program at that time! Soon, the darkness of the show and the bleak storylines each week, ripping the lid off the dark, seamy underbelly of America seemed to get to viewers, and the ratings promptly dropped.
But the show had a loyal and enthralled fan base turning up each week to see Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (the incomparable Terry O'Quinn) solving disturbing serial killer cases and apocalyptic codes as the millennium approached.
Season 1 saw such terrific hours of television as ""Pilot"", ""Gehenna"" (death cult in San Francisco), ""Dead Letters"" (murderer in Portland, OR), ""The Judge"" (creepy man passing judgement on victims), ""522666"" (mad bomber in DC), ""Blood Relatives"" (guy goes after bereaved), ""The Well-Worn Lock"" (disturbing tale of child molestation and incest), ""The Wild and the Innocent"" (brilliant Bonnie & Clyde road trip), ""Weeds"" (claustrophobic gated community story), ""Loin Like a Hunting Flame"" (sexual predator in Boulder, CO), ""Force Majeure"" (brilliant story of clones readying for apocalypse), ""The Thin White Line"" (a copycat haunts Frank from his past), ""Sacrament"" (Frank's sister-in-law is kidnapped), ""Covenant"" (brilliant story of falsely accused man who confesses to murdering his family in Utah), ""Walkabout"" (Frank is amnesiac after drug trial), ""Lamentation"" (Frank's partner is killed by demonic forces), ""Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions"" (a satanic force continues to threaten Frank and his family), ""Broken World"" (a man kills horses and escalates to psycho-sexual murders of human beings!), ""Maranatha"" (the Russian Antichrist is behind shotgun murders in Brighton Beach), and the season finale, ""Paper Dove"", a part 1 of 2 in which Catherine (Frank's wife played by Megan Gallagher) is kidnapped in the end by her polaroid shooting stalker.
The only one of these 22 episodes which gave me nightmares and trouble sleeping was the disturbing episode 9 ""Wide Open"" in which a man in Seattle takes refuge in real estate open houses and kills the native family after they're asleep (in their safely secure home). A girl sees him murder her family and becomes mute and traumatized by the experience. This one had me checking all the locks 3 times and even then I wanted to sleep with the light on (I was just shy of my 14th Birthday though)...
""MillenniuM"" thrived despite bad ratings, due to an unending support base from fans all over the world. Season 2 went under new management with Chris Carter stepping back and Glen Morgan & James Wong (The X-Files/Space: Above & Beyond) taking over exec producer duties. It was the best 23 hours of television ever, and certainly in the history of this show.
Season 3 failed to garner as much intrigue and involvement, taking Chris Carter back as sometimes writer and Chip Johannessen and the disastrous Michael Duggan (wanna blame him for cancellation?) as exec producers. The story tried to finagle a bit of life out of the end of season 2 (an apocalyptic story which ended with the apparent wiping out of the west coast!) but it wasn't as daring, interesting or involving, still a fine piece of work most weeks and well worth owning for continuities' sake.
""MillenniuM"" was ahead of its time. It's 1999-2000 (season 4) end date was never reached officially till a band of united fans wrote 22 brilliant online scripts and week after week gave us something to love and look forward to on the internet. It was a proper ending to the show, recovering as best as possible from the less than stellar season 3.
Now the show is coming to DVD, just 8 years after its debut and 5 years after the end of season 3/online scripts of season 4. But the show isn't over.
Soon, on the internet, a weekly first season of 10 minute short episodes will air under the name ""MillenniuM: Apocalypse"". It will star a model and be crewed by fans/amateur filmmakers. It will be a low budget DIGITAL webcast series in which we follow the weekly exploits of Jordan Black, all grown up (near future?) as she follows her father's footsteps to the Millennium Group, as well as gains new and improved psychic insights and powers (genetically). It looks terrific, and proves whatever the numbers say, the legacy and fan's love of MILLENNIUM lives on!
I plan to buy Season 1 the day it comes out, and have even taken on a summer job picking raspberries in Seattle, WA to pay for it while looking for a regular min. wage type job. I look very forward to season 2 (9/04!) and also season 3 (2005!).

2061276,5,B000244E2O,"I was wondering if Millennium would ever be released. I recall that when this series started, it was to much critical acclaim - and deservedly so. The writing and casting was very refreshing at a time when the X-Files was beginning to devour itself with an endless cycle of a government conspiracy to manipulate aliens who are manipulating the government blah blah blah. Frankly, I think Millennium was purposely ruined by Chris Carter who saw his baby(X-Files) being threatend by a program that captured the mystery and nervous tension that had made X-Files so potent. Clearly I have a bias for this series and it is definitely one my favorites. Not every episode was a masterpiece but the series managed to maintain its originality until the end of season 2 with the release of an apocalyptic plaque and the death of Frank's wife. I like to refer to this episode as Carter's Kamikazi episode because it was as if he not only wanted to end the series but also make damn sure it couldn't plausibly be brought back. I'm sure it was much to Carter's shock and amazement that fan presure brought it back for a third season. Unfortunatly the damage was done, and while I still enjoyed season three it was clear the focus had been lost. Nevertheless, there is always a hope in the back of my mind that Millennium might be resurrected again with the commitment to quality and originality it once had.

When it came out on DVD we rented it, glad to see the extra features and commentaries. Still wishing for more of Chris Carter's unique vision, also rented Harsh Realm & Lone Gunmen. I thought Harsh Realm should have gotten more of a shot, but anything can happen...just like with X-Files, brought back after so many years!",1462147200,,461,4.703703703703703
