8511579,5,6305022968,"I saw this film at the Montreal Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, Imagination (1997) and was taken away.  Finally a film that shows that porno stars are not just top, bottom, or devoid of an existing life outside the porn industry.  Alan Lambert, a.k.a. Alain Le Beau (Allan the Beautiful) had aspiring dreams of becoming an architect and was a highly intelligent human being who paid for his education by becoming a porno star.  Unfortunately, his downfall was that he knew he was going to grow old and committed suicide.  I did not go to see a porn film and thank Willima Jones for allowing me to view the human and compassionate side of the porno star.  What Jones has done now is immortalized Lambert the second time around in this film, Lambert's first immortalization occured on celluloid with his porno appearances.  A beautifully enriched documentary full of poetry and metaphors.  A must see for film buffs.",1005004800,,913,4.777070063694268
8511580,5,6305022968,"This documentary about the inquiry of a director into the suicide of a gay porn star is a highly skillful essay on pornography, postmodernism, and image vs. reality.  The director graciously exposes his own motives for  making the film.  The extended camera shots gives this film both  interesting backdrops and a meditive quality. ""Finished"" explores  issues like creative exploitation and how pornography is more a product of  raw supply-and-demand rather than artistic impulse.  Though this  documentary leaves you with no answers, it makes you think about the people  behind the camera and how models in the sex industry (or models in general)  can be tormented, angry, and helpless: all the things they are not supposed  to be when appearing in their films.  This is highly recommended viewing  for philosophically-minded people and those who appreciate films exhibiting  ""raised consciousness.""",928281600,3,900,5.427536231884058
