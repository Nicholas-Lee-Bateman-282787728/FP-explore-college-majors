7987994,2,B00008YLUF,"My four- and five-year old grandchildren (and I!) thought this was an extremely lame production.  The songs and ""comedy"" were painful  to hear.  There's a small amount of useful technical information but overall it just wasn't worth the money.  I wanted it to teach the kids how to play baseball and I wanted to learn enough about hitting and fielding to understand all the plays when I watch a game.  I'm even embarrassed to give this to Goodwill.",1151107200,4,448,4.6923076923076925
7987995,5,B00008YLUF,"I purchased the DVD for my three year old a few months ago. He loves it. He sings along to the songs and actually mimics what the kids are doing. Every time we play catch or anything related to baseball, he immediately asks me to put in the DVD.

He has really taken an interest in baseball, Basketball, and Soccer, as I purchased the others in this wonderfull series.

I can't wait untill the Football one comes out.

Highly recommend it!",1110412800,,439,4.395061728395062
