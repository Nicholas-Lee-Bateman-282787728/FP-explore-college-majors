7120353,5,B00W5VVOSY,"I watched this film in the theater, and was moved by the stories and interviews therein.  Many people remained in the theater to discuss it afterward, because it is thought provoking.  The cinematography is stunning, and the illustrious persons featured in the film have much to say that is enlightening.  There are many jewels in this film, and I think it is useful not only on a personal basis, but as a tool for those who deal with the process of dying, such as counselors, ministers, nurses or hospice workers.",1433116800,4,514,4.688888888888889

7120355,5,B00W5VVOSY,"Why is death such a taboo subject in our culture? It affects everyone and yet there aren't many conversations about this important topic. I loved this film and how it weaves many different themes together to yield an extremely thought provoking and educational experience. Dr. Schlitz shares her own personal journey of a near death experience and begins questioning what happens when we die. As we embark on this quest with her, we hear fascinating stories, learn some interesting science and uncover different beliefs and rituals around death in other cultures. Having had some profound, unexplainable experiences when my own parents died, I found the stories in the film to be a comfort in knowing others have had very similar experiences.
This is a beautiful, well done film that will stay with you for a long time, not so much thinking about death but appreciating the beauty of life all around and the brief time we have here on earth to enjoy it.",1432166400,6,953,4.852760736196319
7120356,5,B00W5VVOSY,"Death isn't something any of us wants to think about, but this film provides a range of insightful perspectives that helped me to think more deeply about something none of us can avoid.",1431734400,4,185,4.636363636363637
7120357,5,B00W5VVOSY,This film is a gentle doorway into bringing the topic of death out in the open for discussion and contemplation. The filmmaker interviews both scientist and wisdom leaders who make this often-taboo topic accessible in ways that reduce fear and inspire exploration.  It is thoughtfully done with sensitivity to varying worldviews. I have watched it several times now and each time I discover something new.  I think the world would be a better place for us all if we had a deeper understanding of death and this film pushes us in that direction.,1431302400,9,544,4.838709677419355

8712220,5,B00W5VVOSY,"...convinced about the part with regards to a boy's reincarnation who was once his own grandfather, but other than this I enjoyed the many other positive and more or less empirical evidential accounts suggesting that we will still exist after our mortal demise.

Whether you believe in life after life or not, this film is well worth your time to view and ponder about.

Regardless of When the bombs start falling, there are no atheists in foxholes, its still always later than we think (cue the death march music)!",1494028800,,515,4.775280898876405

8712222,5,B00W5VVOSY,"A thoughtful exploration of various views of death, including lots of interesting insights from those in the fields of science and spirituality.  After having lost my father a few months ago, I have been on a quest to explore death more than before, and this was definitely worthwhile.",1486339200,,285,4.9375
8712223,5,B00W5VVOSY,"The insightful documentary provides another perspective on the issue of life after death opening the door for a deeper understanding of the transitioning process for the soon to be departed and the loved ones of the departed. Additionally, I applaud the producer for applying a cinematic soft lens to a subject matter that we often find emotionally difficult to handle, particularly in American culture, yet allows for introspection leading to a change in perception and healthier approach.",1444348800,,490,5.376623376623376

8712225,5,B00W5VVOSY,"This is a very uplifting and beautiful film that truly nourishes the soul. It is what people are very thirsty for. It is a wonderful mosaic of interviews with respected scientists, doctors, and spiritual teachers who create a very heart-felt experience about the subject of death. One feels very inspired after watching it. Death is not something to be feared, but a natural part of life that can be embraced, as we never truly die, but just change forms. Contemplating death also helps us to live our present lives more fully and authentically. This film made me feel very blissful and happy. Marilyn Schiltz should be truly congratulated for her hard work in putting this outstanding documentary together, and Deepak Chopra for supporting her in this wonderful endeavor.",1443830400,,772,5.0390625

8712228,5,B00W5VVOSY,"Earlier reviews have missed the major theme of this important, beautifully produced film: that, as the title says, death makes life possible.  From the outset we are introduced to a man in his prime dying of cancer; he is utterly unafraid to die.  Why is this?  Because he is aware of the broad spectrum of evidence, none of it dependent on religion, that suggests with force that what we call death is entry into another form of life.

This film surveys this spectrum and will leave many of us changed.  Ive just used it in my university class on death, and my students, so used to the tired old physicalism that reigns in academia, are relieved to see that many smart people have another view.  We are spiritual beings navigating for a while through our blessed human bodies, but destined to give them up sooner or later.  And when we do, then a new kind of life, hinted at by the latest consciousness research, opens up.

The producers, Marilyn Schlitz and Deepak Chopra, are careful to emphasize the beauty and value of physical life.  But a more comprehensive view of the total person is crucial, they believe, to the enjoyment of this life.  Without this view, death, no matter how you spin it, is the Big Ugly.  With it, death is tamed.

This film introduces the viewer to the research that does the taming.  It well deserves the many prizes it won, including a silver and a bronze telly.",1433548800,8,1395,4.554216867469879
