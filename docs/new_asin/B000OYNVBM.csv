8494835,5,B000OYNVBM,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now semi-regularly buying on Amazon episodes  from the first four seasons that I have never seen (which technically means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know a few things:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and snark of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway!)
2) While I don't have time for huge writeups on each DVD, I will do a few sentences. Ed is a nice guy but is nothing less than a scream with his pre-makeover wardrobe. Just S and C's reactions to him alone make this an ep well worth having ...
3) ... However, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the current $19.95 price for each of these DVDs is way too high. I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to happily buy them. Amazon is probably loving that. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. But if you do spring for this ep you will enjoy it.

SIDE NOTE TO AMAZON, TLC, AND DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
I would immediately buy DVDs of WNTW Seasons 5-10, if they exist and are made available, especially S 5, 6, and 7, even at this price (although, again, not everybody would). Some people just prefer the DVD experience to the computer/streaming video setup you offer for the later seasons of the show. Hit me up on whether this is a possibility! Or if there's anybody else out there who has an idea on how I can get these DVDs, please contact me. Thanks!",1412812800,,1701,4.198776758409786
