2116561,5,B0002S65O0,"It's a short anime series and out of all of them released in the past few years Shootfighter is one of the best. All three episodes are action packed with grappling and holding moves that will leave you with a hanging jaw. This series is dedicated to showing viewers extreme fight sequences that have never been seen before. You are first introduced to young teen Kiichi who talks a lot but can back it up. Kiichi is very skilled in martial arts and who wouldn't be when you have a father who is not only an expert at the deadly Nanshin Shadow Style but who is an ex pro wrestler as well.

Kiichi's Father puts him through brutal training night after day but somehow this kid can crave more. He wants to be as strong as his father and one day beat him in a fight and these three episodes show how he gains endless knowledge and strength. Shootfighter Tekken is an amazing series and this complete collection is sort of reasonable considering you save 10$ and you get some cool DVD extras. The final match between Kiichi and Iron Kiba is crazy and the two stop at nothing to kill each other and it makes a great ending for a great series. The animation is just right but don't get confused because at times they make Kiichi look as big as the guys he's fighting and then you find out that he is really small.",1140048000,,1307,4.313008130081301
2116562,5,B0002S65O0,"The first time me and my two friends saw the cover for this box set  we couldn't stop laughing because on how ridiculous it looked and the original Japanese title for Shootfighter Tekken made it even more funnier Highschool Exciting Story: Tough. Haha we laughed for hours to tears even. This anime series is crazy, so crazy that it was awesome. All I have to say about it is Iron Kiba and a helicoptor. WATCH IT!!!",1137888000,,415,4.4605263157894735

hoping for more sequels.",1395100800,2,117,4.619047619047619
8030966,5,B0002S65O0,What can I say...I've been searching for this series since I was a teenager. I saw a few episodes when I was young but never got to see the big fight. Excellent story and great fight scenes. Now remember if you get this the video is good it's just that the originals weren't that great. SOOOoo worth it though. If you like Baki The Grappler you'll like this one as well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!,1340150400,,392,4.3108108108108105
8030967,5,B0002S65O0,"The box set includes 3 OVA each about 45 minuets long, the graphics and visuals are really great for the time the was released, even though the original manga went on a lot longer this was a good and fairly accurate look at the young Keichi. This  is better than Baki the grappler in my opinon, very realistic in some parts and the action is very intense and has a lot of motion to it. A must have for fans of martial arts anime.",1325721600,,429,4.107142857142857
8030968,5,B0002S65O0,"If you are a fan of mixed martial arts, you'll love this anime. Intense action, comedy, and overall entertaining anime. A definite classic.",1324944000,,139,5.086956521739131
8030969,3,B0002S65O0,"I really liked this anime it had a good story and some really cool grappling action.  Its the story of a father who is passing his deadly family martial art to his son. I think the season should have been stretched out a little more, more episodes, more conflict building, more charater development. good anime not great but definitly worth the price i would like to see a season two but i know this will never happen.  its not as good as baki but it could have been if it was just stretched out a lil more.",1245888000,,507,4.216494845360825
