and after watching it again, it still remains as a nice family
film. plus i had a thing for Alex McKenna back in the days LOL so
it's always good to see her during her younger days again. nowadays,
she looks sooooo different, like you probably wouldn't recognize her
until u see her name pop up in the credits of a TV show episodes she
appears in.",1321747200,,413,4.175

Not only was it a bit boring but also it was supposed to be a free download as some sort of gift to me from amazon, however, it was never downloaded, it just played on my computer once. Still, it was a good lesson for me. I will never attempt to purchase a downloadable movie through amazon because of this issue.",1319760000,,347,4.117647058823529
