2012231,5,B0001LJCL6,"The new ""Dragon Tales"" DVD focuses on stories about overcoming fear. Included is ""Have No Fear"" - a story about Ord's fear of a butterfly/frog hybrid creatured called a ""butterfrog"" and ""Try It You'll Like It,"" - a story in which our Dragon Tales friends try to help Zak overcome his fear of the attractions at the Dragon Land Amusement Park. Both are fairly well-written stories that have a good approach to the topic.
However, the main and most important reason why show fans should get those DVD right away is the presence of the story ""Cowboy Max"" on this DVD. This story is part an episode that was supposed to air during the final batch of five shown on PBS, but instead ended up airing only foreign markets for unknown reasons. The two stories in that episode: ""Just the Two of Us"" and the one on this DVD - ""Cowboy Max,"" featured some of the best writing and dialogue ever seen on the series.
Stories are presented full-screen and a play-all feature is included.",1085529600,21,970,4.548571428571429
