8128901,5,B000G5SIJE,"Ground breaking because rarely, if ever, have theologians, both Jewish and Christian scholars, been interviewed on 12 in-depth subjects based on the Gospel of John.  It is a fascinating discussion with some of the most notable biblical scholars of our time, some of whom, have passed.  They give various possible interpretations and/or commentaries of various texts.  It is possible to begin to see through the history of time and apologetics to the Second Temple period Judaism.

I have known this work since the 90s and remember the firestorm of controversy that it caused in France when it was aired on Arte.  This work soars over denominational bias in a big way, and it also shows how different scholars view the texts. We are fortunate to be able to view this documentary.

Quite frankly, I do not understand how linguists, historians, literary critics, archaeologists, authors, and other experts in biblical study from the US, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, England, and other countries can be summarily dismissed in other reviews.  It's quite unfortunate.

Don't miss this. As I re-watch the video each year; there is always something I miss.

Everybody should see it, it is a very accurate study of most of the angles of Christianity.",1343865600,,152,4.464285714285714
8128903,1,B000G5SIJE,"Absolute Blasphemy. Don't pollute your mind with this garbage. Just another attack on Christianity. If the makers of this film have ever just simply read the Bible, the would never have been able to make this. Its obvious that they have not.",1339718400,,241,4.761904761904762

All Honor and Glory to the Son of God, Jesus, Christ,  Savior, Redeemer who lived committing no sin while he was in the flesh on this Earth.  UPON HIS REVELATION ""EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW AND EVERY TONGUE CONFESS THAT JESUS IS THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY""",1311638400,,294,4.84
8128905,5,B000G5SIJE,"Facets Video has given us a remarkable, 12-hour discussion among 27 of the world's top Christian and Jewish Bible scholars who've researched aspects of the final days of Jesus' life.

Divided into 12 themes, it's ideal for teachers, clergy, interested lay people to watch over a period of weeks.

In investing in these DVDs, you should be aware that the format is ""talking heads"" -- and usually that's a pejorative phrase. But, the fact is that these are some of the smartest ""heads"" in the world -- and their conversations are mesmerizing.

The filmmakers argue that, if they had produced dramatic visual segments to illustrate scenes in the discussion, they would have placed indelible visual stamps on what these things ""really looked like."" In fact, the whole point of this fascinating documentary series is to peel back those accumulated layers of centuries-old assumptions -- to freshly consider the actual original record.

It's well worth the investment for teachers, groups, congregations -- and anyone who's interested in what the world's top scholars are actually saying about these issues today.",1203120000,,1107,5.202247191011236
