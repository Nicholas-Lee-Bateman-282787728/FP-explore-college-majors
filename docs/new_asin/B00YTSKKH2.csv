8719224,5,B00YTSKKH2,This movie will truely change anyone who come in contact with it and listens deeply to its wise message. This is the closest to G-dliness within a video. Highly recommended! I noticed a remarkable change in the two major actresses who did voice in the video and I'd have no doubt their positive voices in the media were directly inspired by their involvement in making this video,1527206400,,379,4.6716417910447765
8719225,5,B00YTSKKH2,"I went into this movie with not a drop of knowledge of the old Jewish tales, but I came away entertained and educated. Tawd b. Dorenfeld's film is a playful, imaginative telling of the tales of the Baal Shem Tov, a pivotal figure who changed the face of Judaism. The stories shared are centered around basic moral tenets and offer an uplifting view of life. It's a good family film no matter your religious persuasion. Another great element of this film is its nearly flawless execution of stop-motion animation. Stop-motion is a painstaking and detailed art, and it doesn't the credit it deserves in the age of digital graphics, but Dorenfeld's ""Baal Shem Tov"" reminds us of the artistic and storytelling quality that stop-motion animation can offer.

And who says a movie can't have a soul? This movie has the most deepest soul imaginable!  This movie is based on true events of the great Jewish sage known as the Baal Shem Tov (Master of the good name). These stories are so honest and touching, so enlightening and inspiring, you will find them life-changing. Perfect for any age. Don't let the exquisitely done figurines and great cinematography cause you to think this movie is made for children. The stories are for every age and every religion.basically everyone who has a soul. . .",1440547200,7,695,4.515873015873016
