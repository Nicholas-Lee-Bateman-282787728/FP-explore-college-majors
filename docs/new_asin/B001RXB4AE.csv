More special features would've been appreciated, there's just a few storyboards on each disk.
Chowder fans will love it! :)",1252540800,,342,5.0
3781970,4,B001RXB4AE,"Chowder is a great show with a lot of fun for everyone involved. Our household ranges from 3 to 32, and all four of us love to watch the show. One really nice ""extra"" is the credit sequences that

So the essential content of this DVD 2 Pack is great, because the show is great. But the DVDs are a pretty bare bones package, with a minimum of episodes and only one special feature on each disc (storyboards for a random episode). The cheapness is underscored by the price, which isn't terrible, but not as compelling as some of CN's other packages (like the first season of Foster's for $15). Also, keep in mind that when they say 10 episodes, they count each airing as two episodes. Better packaging or a cheaper price would have gotten another star.",1241136000,4,750,4.434782608695652

8339216,5,B001RXB4AE,"I remember the good cartoons like PPG, Dexter's lab, and many others. As a teen, there just isn't as much good tv on as there was when I was a kid, however there is one: Chowder.

Chowder seems like a mix of Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy & Spongebob, but with it's own uniquness. This show is very funny, cute, and very well animated! I just hope CN puts out Volume 3 soon.",1261353600,,378,4.108108108108108
