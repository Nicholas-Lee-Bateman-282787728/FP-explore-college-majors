strokes, he paints a picture of how the 21st century will look in
economic and geopolitical terms. There are enough specifics to make
the work useful and set a place for America in the new order.",1214265600,,266,4.5625
8160262,5,B000L42NZK,"This appreciation of William Styron consists in clips of interviews Charlie Rose had done with him. Styron is considered one of the most distinguished of the Post-War novelists, an heir to Faulkner in presenting a vision of the tormented American South. But he also wrote on another topics including his own Depression, and a novel on the 'Holocaust'. Rose as always is understanding and works to bring out the best in his subject. His capacity for appreciating people from so many different walks of life , for honoring their work and memory is highly commendable.",1197417600,,565,4.957894736842105
