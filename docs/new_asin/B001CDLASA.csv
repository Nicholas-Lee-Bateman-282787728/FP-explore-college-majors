3509625,5,B001CDLASA,I can remember running home from high school to watch this show and it is as good as I remember. Black and White makes an even better setting for this sinister show.  Once a Dark Shadows fan always a Dark Shadows fan.,1257120000,,217,4.166666666666667
3509626,4,B001CDLASA,"I am enjoying this Season 6 of the Beginning. The episodes seem to be more suspenseful than the first seasons. Laura Collins is certainly an interesting and sinister character as well as Jason Mcguire who is staying at Collinwood. I like the melodramatic introductions to each episode narrated by Victoria Winters.
One strange thing about the Collinwood mansion -only 1 phone in a mansion? I am amused by the characters always rushing downstairs to answer the phone. Can't the Collins afford an upstairs phone?
This is fun viewing and enjoyable in an oldfashioned type of way, in spite of the filming quirks.",1249171200,3,608,4.970588235294118
3509627,5,B001CDLASA,"I became a fan of Dark Shadows many years ago when I rushed home after school to watch it at 3 o'clock!  I, like many others, became aware of the show because of Barnabas the Vampire. I didn't know the show had been on for about a year before that. So it is a real treat to catch up on the show from the very beginning and see what a truly great show is was from the start! To see these episodes for the first time is really an experience! Great reproduction from MPI also! They did a very good job of preserving the episodes and filling in what might have been lost otherwise! Excellent collection! I now have the whole series on DVD!",1249084800,3,635,4.120967741935484

3509629,5,B001CDLASA,"This volume I purchased last month. The last volume of the beginning episodes Volume 6 pre Barnabas Collins. Played by Mr Jonathan Frid. I was pleased with this. As it introduced my other favorite character Willie Loomis. Played by Mr John Karlen. Another young man played the part of Willie Loomis before Mr Karlen took the role of Willie. I LOVE John Karlen. And there's the episode of Barnabas Collin's making his way to the Collin's house. On disc four. Bonus feature restored episode #211. I do recommend the beginning volumes 1-6 Pre Barnabas. As the viewer gets to know these characters. Before Barnabas made his appearance. The beginning volumes set the ball rolling for me. I fell in love with this show. And I am pleased to see it available now. After so long. Thank you, thank you for releasing the Beginning Volumes.",1239235200,4,828,4.756944444444445
3509630,5,B001CDLASA,"I have really enjoyed this collection and highly recommend it to any DS fan. I wasn't sure what to expect from the ""Beginnings"" because I had read many commentaries stating that the pre-Barnabas series was somehow different, or a pale imitation of the post-Barnabas series.

Not true! The episodes in ""Beginnings - 6"" felt to me very much like the more familiar part of the series - the same moody atmosphere, the same music (!), the same building of drama and tension, and the same spookiness. So I think these early episodes have been under-rated. For example, right off the bat in collection 6, we have unauthorized grave-openings, coffins, an eery cemetery-keeper, a resurrected-from-the-dead menace to the Collins family, and an apparition. The black-and-white photography enhances the effect of these episodes, much as it does in the early Barnabas period.

Another thing I like about these episodes is that it does straight drama in addition to the spooky stuff, and it does the drama well. Louis Edmonds & Joan Bennett stand out in this regard - and the good dramatic quality continues right into the post-Barnabas era. In short, I see a seamless transition between the two eras of the show.

There are some fun extras, too, in this set. They show the original ""take"" shots (or whatever you call those) in which someone holds up a writing board stating the episode # and the date aired - and occasionally, there are some surprises in these shots!

Highly recommended.",1232841600,5,1475,4.911646586345381
3509631,5,B001CDLASA,"I remember as a 6-year old little boy coming home from school each day to see mama having on Dark Shadows at 4:00pm on Channel 13 ( our local ABC network ) . That was back in 1967. Those memories still stick in my head .
Later on , as I got older, and could better understand
storylines, it was great to see those episodes repeated through what is called ""syndication .""  However, I didn't even know there were these so-called early episodes before the arrival of Barnabas. Those episodes were only shown (to my knowledge) on their first-run air date.
I have purchased every single DVD of this series 1-26 , and now 1-6 of The Beginning.
I highly recommand any DARK SHADOWS fan to purchase and have in their collection all 6 volumes of these episodes that starts from THE BEGINNING to complete their set. I can hardly wait to have the final set of episodes in Volume 6 , and will have my 4:00pm's Monday through Friday relived when I come home from work.
Trust me, and buy this Volume 6.
It is too bad no network - cable or free tv  - won't take a chance of reviving the series; unlike the failed attempt of NBC, I think it is worth a try.",1222041600,10,1139,4.244239631336406
3509632,5,B001CDLASA,"Fans of the Classic TV show Dark Shadows have wrung their hands in anxiety, held seancs, looked into crystal balls and read tarot cards to divine when - or if - the next DVD release of their favorite gothic soap opera would EVER be released, but mainly they've just plain waited and waited and WAITED. In fact, they've waited for these DVD episodes longer than the beloved series aired - and now it's finally come true.

MPI Home Video began releasing Dark Shadows episodes onto DVD on May 28, 2002, with its first boxed set of 40 episodes, which began about a year after the series debuted and included the fabled first appearance of 175-year-old vampire, Barnabas Collins, impeccably portrayed by Jonathan Frid.

Now, more than six years later, Dark Shadows: The Beginning, Vol. 6, collects the remaining black and white episodes to be released on DVD, truly coming full circle, as it ends with the fully-restored and remastered episode of the fabled first appearance of 175-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins!

In total, all 1225 episodes from the iconic horror series (which premiered on ABC June 27, 1966, and aired episodes until April 2, 1971) are now available on DVD. Whew!

When MPI began releasing episodes on DVD, they had not decided if they would release ALL of them or certainly the pre-Barnabas episodes, because they tended to be less popular than those after the arrival of everyone's favorite Creature of the Night. In the end, they decided to release everything, calling the pre-Barnabas episodes ""The Beginning"" series, of which this is the final of six sets.

MPI should be genuinely congratulated for its unwavering commitment in releasing the entire catalog of Dark Shadows episodes onto DVD. Few studios show that kind of dedication to fans, plainly evident by the large number of Classic TV shows that have been dropped after only a couple of DVD season releases, or even dropped in mid-season. Imagine a studio committing to release 1225 episodes of ANYTHING onto DVD, much less a cult TV series from the 1960s. Also, we fans deserve huge kudos for our steadfast devotion to be willing to wait out the lengthy release schedule to enthusiastically obtain the entire series run. The fact that it has even happened is a tribute to the enduring power of Dark Shadows, which cast a powerful spell that has transcended time: It is truly the show that would not die.

The episodes in this set continue to focus on the unexpected return of Roger Collins' wife, Laura Murdock Collins, whose presence has become more mysterious, supernatural and - very, very dangerous.

Roger (Louis Edmonds) had told his young son David (David Henesy) that his mother was dead, but she had actually suffered a mental breakdown and was confined in sanitarium. Since being released, she apparently had been living in Phoenix, Ariz., unbeknownst to the Collins family.

Without warning, Laura (Diana Millay) returned to Collinwood and demanded full custody of her son. Roger's sister, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Joan Bennett) steadfastly refused, and was inexplicably stricken by what appeared to be a trance, but was actually a spell cast by Laura.

Now, Governess Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke) has figured out that two other Laura's (Laura Murdock and Laura Murdock Stockridge,) each died by fire exactly 100 years apart. Now, Laura Murdock Collins wants to take David away with her, despite a series of foretellings that depict them being consumed in fire: exactly one hundred years after the death of Laura Murdock Stockridge.

In a dramatic and fiery finale never seen before that time in soap opera history, Victoria struggles to pull David away from his mother in the midst of a crackling fire that threatens to destroy them all. The Phoenix is Reborn! (This represented the series first truly supernatural story arc, along with its first seanc, which would become a Dark Shadows' staple.)

Classically trained actor Frid became Barnabas Collins at Episode 211, which first aired 04/18/67. Frid was beyond perfect, playing the most unusual role completely straight. He was compelling, guilt-ridden and just as often cruel and dangerous. Almost immediately, the show, which had been constantly threatened with early cancellation, skyrocketed in the ratings and made Frid an international super star. (Note: Many fans who began watching only after Barnabas had become a fixture on the show, either never saw these early episodes when they first aired, or when they were syndicated for a short time years later.)

In this set, Episode 191 has extended footage, and Frid's Episode 211 has been fully restored and remastered. Original 1967 commercials that aired at the time are included as a special feature, along with new interviews and newsreel footage of movie star Joan Bennett.

This set is also noteworthy for introducing the character of Willie Loomis (originally horribly portrayed by James Hall who was VERY thankfully and quickly replaced by the brilliant John Karlen.) It was Willie, after all, who inadvertently let Barnabas out of his coffin and the rest is soap opera, entertainment and cultural history!!

Let's hope that whichever studio or studios that have the rights to the two 1971 Dark Shadows' movies, House of Dark Shadows and Night of Dark Shadows, finally allow those dead films rise from their coffins and onto DVD. I just hope that it won't take yet more seancs and spooky incantations, not to mention more YEARS of waiting, to get it done!",1216339200,68,5476,5.04983388704319

3509648,5,B001CDLASA,"I'm starting to go back and re-watch some of the beginning episodes before the infamous vampire, Barnabas showed up. These episodes are much better the 2nd time around. If you skip these great episodes just to see Barnabas, you'll have no idea what's going on and I'll be very aggravated at you! (This review WILL contain some spoilers!!) Dr. Guthrie is still getting to the bottom of what sent Liz to the hospital and trying to figure out what exactly Laura Collins is. He, along with Joe Haskell and Frank Garner go grave-digging trying to unravel the mystery. Soon, the time comes for David to live or to join his mother in eternal flame.

Soon, the residents of Collinwood have a new problem to deal with; Jason Maguire and his sidekick, Willie Loomis. Jason blackmails Liz into staying at Collinwood. Willie wants in on the action and begins harassing the women. (The original Willie Loomis was very creepy and psychotic) He wants the family jewels and begins to dig for them, only to find something so monstrous that's been buried in the shadows for nearly 200 years.

Aside from the fact that he consistently mispronounced his own character's name, (Willie ""Low-mis,"" Willie ""Luhm-mis""...) he was--well, let's put it this way, it was a relief when John Karlen stepped in.

3509696,5,B001CDLASA,"I LOVE ""Laura"". Contrary to popular belief, ""Laura"" saved 'D.S.' from cancellation. It's true that ""Barnabas"" & later ""Quentin"" made the ratings soar but ""Laura"" brought the ratings up enough for ABC to quickly change the cancellation plans. Her story was wonderful & NEVER gets the credit it deserves. The story of Frid saving the show is simply untrue & has been repeated so many times that it has become believed by everyone. While 'D.S.' never got higher than #10 or so in the annual daytime ratings it did become the # 1 ABC soap for a time. The disasterous 1970 parallel time storyline was responsible for a HUGE drop in the ratings & the following present day ""Gerard & Daphne"" story did nothing to help but the ratings again started to climb once we began the 1840 storyline. They continued to rise with the 1841 PT storyline (which many fans now wrongly believe was responsible for killing the show). It was wonderful & fresh but Frid & Bennett were so tired of the grueling demands of a soap that they, along with Curtis' boredom with the show, are the REAL reasons for 'D.S.' demise. Even though the show only lasted until April of 1971 it still managed to get a 5.3 rating for the year. That was amazing & shows that the ratings were not responsible for the cancellation. The former reasons along with ABC not being happy with the young audience that 'D.S.' attracted killed it. How ironic that today that youth market is now coveted & is what the networks want. If one checks the ratings for the years the show aired, one will see the truth in 'black & white'. We are SO lucky MPI has finally released ALL of 'D.S.'. These early episodes contain most of the series finest acting. Its so good without the downright terrible 'acting' of Hall & Karlen. Even though the first ""Willie"" couldn't remember a single line (which is why he was fired) his performance was sleazy, creepy, & violent---which is what the character was supposed to be. Karlen was about as threatening as a smiley face & after ""Barnabas"" enslaved him, he became a simpering idiot---which is what was supposed to happen---but Karlen's ham was almost unbearable. He NEVER had a single character that was believable & real. Hall at least got 1 character that she could play well. (Magda) When either of them had scenes with Bennett, Frid, Selby, or Jackson, they looked simply ridiculous. Even Frid & Hall's own husband Sam have,in interviews on random DVD's & at the T.V. Archive website,said the same things about Hall & Karlen's so-called 'performances.  BUT I digress, 'D.S.' was WONDERFUL & I am DELIGHTED we now have the entire series to enjoy for all time.",1334361600,,2640,4.67741935483871

I love the two actors: Dennis Patrick and John Karlen.  Actually the entire cast is terrific and no matter if they remake this again for the big screen, it'll never be better than the originals. NO ONE can match Karlen's nervous, hyper-sensitivity.  He's the best!  This collection is well worth the $ which I think is a fair price.  On an earlier review I forgot to mention that Karlen doesn't come in until Disk 4. THere is a far less effective (and far less handsome) actor playing Willie in the beginning.  I am SO glad that Karlen took his place.  What an improvement in how the characterization was handled and as I said, Karlen is quite handsome.  Anyway, even if he doesn't show up till Disk 4, I'm glad I bought it.  When he does enter the cast, he's absolutely terrific!",1294358400,2,949,4.562130177514793
