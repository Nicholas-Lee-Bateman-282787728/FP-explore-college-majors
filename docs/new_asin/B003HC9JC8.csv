8396996,5,B003HC9JC8,"I bought the 4 DVD Core Pilates set for beginners and these were 2 of the DVDs included in that set.  But I wanted to write a review of these 2 in particular.

I have bought many Pilates Beginner/Intermediate DVDs and Michaela Sirbu's ""Beginner Pilates in Detail"" is the best instructional video for a beginner who wants to learn the 7 basic Pilates exercises well.  Her instructions are detailed and clear and easy to understand and follow.  She breaks each exercise down into its' parts: breathing sequence, arm movements, powerhouse/core, leg movements and shows modifications for each level of Pilates skill so that you can start as a beginner and improve your technique to higher levels as you get stronger and more skilled.

If you are just starting Pilates, as I am (2 months), I highly recommend these 2 DVDS !!!!",1407628800,3,821,4.794326241134752
8396997,5,B003HC9JC8,"No matter what level of Pilates you are at Michaela is thorough, clear, precise, and informative on how to do Pilates. Her years of expertise show. She knows what she is talking about. Not just how to do Pilates positions but what the positions do for you. Michaela explains how to do them correctly so as not to hurt yourself. I've learned so much from her on how to do Pilates correctly! Other DVDs have never given me as much instruction and caring. It is like she is right there guiding me through each position. Her passion for Pilates and helping you achieve a more fit body shows through her work and how she instructs you through the workout. If you work out at home, Michaela's Pilates DVDs are the best investment in your fitness. Check out her ""Pilates on the Go"" and ""Principles and Basics of Pilates"" (which is where you should begin Pilates), as well.",1332633600,2,865,4.515923566878981
8396998,5,B003HC9JC8,"I have retired early, so I'm on the golf course a few days a week. Like most passionate golfers, my goal over the years has been to improve my swing and the enjoyment of the game.  I've been hearing that many competitive golfers, men and women, practice Pilates to learn how to use their core muscles more efficiently, but I never tried it myself until I started working with your DVDs.  What a great Christmas gift my wife bought up for me!  (your ""Principles and Basics of Pilates"", ""Beginner Pilates in Detail"" and ""About Balance"" DVDs).  I can't believe how much of a difference these exercises are making!  After only a month of practice my abdominal muscles feel stronger, I can twist better, I am aware of tensing my neck and shoulders, I breathe more often and have more energy - my whole body feels great!

What I most like about your DVDs is that you explain things so very simply.  More than that, you give the reason for each move.  Maybe not everybody needs to know why, or what, is being worked in a given exercise, but I do.  Your demeanour is pleasant and assuring; you smile and giggle from time to time, which makes the viewer feel you're human and likeable; you give us an ""out"" (i.e. do what we can, don't strain, build toward maximum achievement, etc.); your accent is exotic, which somehow gives the viewer confidence in your ability; and you ""speak"" to your audience through eye contact.

Repetition is so important when learning the basics of any endeavour.  I am glad to see that you employ this method, as the volume of information can be overwhelming to the beginner.  In fact, you stated that at the outset.

I really like how you demonstrate the manoeuvre at the start of each segment, then break it down and explain each element.  That is perfect.  The intelligent, serious student ""gets"" that.

By the way, my wife also picked up your Foam Roller video - she loves it!  She got me to roll my back and thighs on it a few times too, and although it was painful to start, I can see how my legs and back feel looser already.  Thanks a lot for your great videos!

8396999,5,B003HC9JC8,"I've gotten my hands on a series of fabulous DVDs!  From the way the instructor presents  the exercises I can tell that she's been dedicated to Pilates and Yoga for a while.  The explanations and cues are so clear and concise, even I can understand them although I haven't practiced this sort of exercises before.  I really like how she even explains the ""why's"" of each maneouvre and how she specifically targets muscle groups I haven't used in a while.  After the workout, I feel refreshed, like I have a different body!  Then I take the lessons and apply them during my day.  I bought ""Principles and Basics of Pilates"", ""Beginner Pilates in Detail"", ""Better Posture"" and ""The Foam Roller"" - now I plan to invest in the other DVDs this instructor offers because I want to look just like her!",1292976000,,794,4.588652482269503
8397000,4,B003HC9JC8,"I am so happy with the videos I purchased that decided to write the same review in all of them. Hope you don't mind!
You have an awesome selection of DVDs!  I watched your excellent teaching on the YouTube samples and have decided to invest in 3 of your DVDs to start:  Toned Arms, Buttocks and Thighs, Beginner Pilates in Detail and The Foam Roller.  As a man, I've  always felt self-conscious about going to Pilates and Yoga classes, because there are always more women than men in  class, but also wanted the benefits I've heard you can get from these exercises.  I've finally  decided to give it a try in my house and what a great decision that was!  The way you teach, is like I have personal instruction in my own living room anyway and I can put a DVD on whenever I can find a half-hour.  My push-ups are better then ever and, my arms, back and chest are getting so much stronger although not bulky at all.  In a very short time, my flexibility has improved, both in the back and legs. At this rate, I will be able to touch my toes soon.  My Abs are getting so much stronger!  I've been running for many years and have had knee pain because of tightness in my outer thighs. What a difference the Foam Roller massage is making!  I'm hooked.  Sometimes I roll my back and thighs on it 2-3 times a day because it takes only a few minutes and it makes me feel so much better.  I'm grateful for the knowledge that you shared in your videos!  (Ray, Nov 22, 2010)",1290470400,,1463,4.227436823104693
8397001,5,B003HC9JC8,"I just wanted to let you know that you have inspired me to do Pilates again, after a long pause.  I'm glad that I picked up your DVDs!  There are so professionally done, the exercises are so well explained, the movements make much more sense now - plus I'm seeing results that I had been seeking, after only working with them DVDs for a short time.  What a worthwhile investment!  Love all 3 of them: Pilates on the Go, Principles and Basics of Pilates, Beginner Pilates - in Detail plus 2 Progressive Workout Sequences.  Your Foam Roller, too, it's such a good workout !!  and much cheaper than going for a massage!",1290297600,,616,4.455357142857143
