8231432,5,B000Y9P2XC,"Wonderful dvd for those long time fans of Tommy James. What a great voice in American music! BTW, don't be ripped off by some sellers. If you can't get a good price here than you can on TJ's site!",1418169600,,196,4.051282051282051
8231433,5,B000Y9P2XC,"This is well worth buying. Tommy James along with the Shondells perform their best songs live.
The small stage and audience provides for an up close look at their performance and every song is great.",1402012800,,199,4.714285714285714
8231434,5,B000Y9P2XC,"He does all the hits and the band couldn't be tighter! There were a few songs that I would have liked to hear, such as Ball of Fire, but overall I'm totally satisfied. Great audio and video, I will watch this over and over again!",1364688000,,229,4.111111111111111
8231435,5,B000Y9P2XC,"On time and as promised. I had bought the 60s pop rock dvd and wanted more Tommy James..
This was the only one I found and it is excellent.
A real shame he is not recording new music. This one gives the feeling you are really there.
Go ahead and order it. You will really enjoy it.",1362528000,,281,3.9473684210526314
8231436,5,B000Y9P2XC,"I grew up in the 60's and 70's with the music of Tommy James & The Shondells.  Back then the music and titles sounded so professional and well thought out.  Watching Tommy in this video describe in minute detail how some of the songs and titles came to be used was so interesting.  The songs have stood the test of time - hearing them on the radio now just brings a smile to my face as it was when I was in my teens.  The concert video was great - good sound and camera work.  Anyone who loved this music should get this video, sit back, and just let the music flow.",1361750400,,566,4.017857142857143
8231437,5,B000Y9P2XC,"Only footage of Tommy James I could find on DVD. Exceeded my expectations. He sounds just like his albums, even better actually!! Such great music and the band really rocked. I gave it a 5 star because it captures the electrifying energy of his concerts. I'm 25. A fan, and am very happy. Thanks!",1359244800,,296,4.5
8231438,5,B000Y9P2XC,"I really did enjoy this dvd of a Tommy James Concert.  I couldn't help but get up and dance and sing along with old favorites like ""I think we're alone now' and others.  Highly recommended.",1353888000,,189,4.371428571428571
8231439,5,B000Y9P2XC,"I was very pleased with the Best of Tommy James & The Shondells:  Live at the Bitter End.  The video and sound quality of the DVD was excellent, but what really surprised me is the band sounds just as good as they did in the 60s & 70s.  Tommy James vocals still sound like they did when he was a teenager.  Great video, I recommend it for anybody that likes his genre.  Brought back a lot of memories.",1349913600,,401,4.089743589743589
