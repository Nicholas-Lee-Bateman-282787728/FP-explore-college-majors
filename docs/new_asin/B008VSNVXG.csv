8531232,5,B008VSNVXG,"Along with ""Jeff Beck - Live in Tokyo"", these two Blu Rays have shot up to the top of my regular play list.  I think there have been enough superlatives about the greatness of the music on both of these recordings - thank you Jeff, Imelda, Vinnie, Tal, Jason, Shorty, Blue Lou, Setzer, and the other great musicians you find on these two very different live recordings - but the point I want to stress here is that YES, these are superbly filmed and recorded Blu Rays.  If you are a fan of musical virtuosity at its finest, and  you've got an AV system that you want to really crank and enjoy, then, yes, these two discs need to be in your collection. The price changes, so check the prices of the two individual Blu Rays before you buy this combo.",1420329600,2,748,4.290780141843972
