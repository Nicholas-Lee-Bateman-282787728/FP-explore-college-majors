8608656,3,B00EREY7OK,"This movie is hilarious and I loved it (from a previous viewing with English subs)...but I wish the seller would have specified whether or not the DVD had subtitles...it does NOT.
The movie itself gets 5 stars...the seller is the reason it's only 3.",1454716800,,249,4.681818181818182
