8126268,4,B000FT77X4,"The plot of this comedy-drama involves a businesssman (Gaston Pauls who also appears in the movie Nine Queens among others) who wants to sell an old locomotive (# 33 also known as Heart of Fire)in Uruguay to a company in Hollywood.  The proposition is viewed favorably by many locals, but opposed by an elderly group calling itself the ""Friends of the Rails.""  This group includes the well known Argentine actors Hector Alterio (as ""the Professor"") and Federico Luppi (as ""Pepe"" who notionally learned to operate trains in the Spanish Civil War).  Members of the ""friends"" steal the train to preserve this piece of patrimony and set off on a senic journey across Uruguay while being chased by the police.  Altiero and Luppi give their usual fine performances in this award-winning (Goya award, Montreal film festival, others)film.  The film is not profound but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.  The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.",1368489600,,942,5.124183006535947
