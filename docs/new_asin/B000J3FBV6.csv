That being said if you already own Robotech Remastered Macross collection you are not going to find anything really new to see.  This version of Macross uses the same restored video footage as Robotech remastered but with a new English language dialog dub.  In my opinion I find this dub to be superior to the Macek et.al Robotech dub as it is less kiddie and more grown up.  After all the crew of the Macross find themselves in the middle of the warzone and I found Macek's take on things to be just a tad too juvenile.  Not to mention the incessant prattling of the overbearing narrator, Robotech version, is no where to be found on this version.  That being said I own both the Robotech Remastered Macross collection and this version of Macross Remastered.  If I had known this version of Macross was going to be published I wouldn't have bought the Robotech version.  That being said it is fun to watch both and compare contrast the differences between the two versions.  This version of Macross does contain extra behind the scenes documentary information you won't find on the Robotech version.",1308009600,2,1176,4.615384615384615
8149057,5,B000J3FBV6,"I was surprised when this series was released. Macross has been released as Robotech three times on VHS, and I've lost count of how many times on DVD. Macross was released in late 2001 in it's original Japanese, subtitled only in a high quality set. So why pick it up now? Well, this is for people who  don't like reading subtitles. The dub is also pretty good.

This is the grand finale of Macross. Well, the original creators had planned episode 27 to be the ending, but the series was expanded to 36 episodes. The last 9 episodes happen ""two years later"" as the survivors try to rebuild the earth. It gets to be very much like a soap-opera with the Minmay vs Misa part getting very heavy near the end, but if you've watched all the episodes up to this point, you're heavily emotionally invested in finding out what happens.

This volume also contains a flashback episode featuring Roy Focker and Claudia, and a Christmas episode (do they celebrate Christmas in Japan?) The extras include liner notes, and a series of interviews where ADV producers gush over how much they love Macross.",1213401600,6,1088,4.626943005181347
8149058,4,B000J3FBV6,"This is good anime, but it was not worth it to re-buy Robotech Macross Saga. Still the same anime, characters, and enemies. If you have the original, don't bother. If you don't then get this Macross and Robotech paved the way for the anime of today, and it is worth having.",1207353600,2,273,4.372549019607843
