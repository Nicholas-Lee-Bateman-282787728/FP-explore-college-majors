The only thing missing was a rendition of Kumbayah to go with it. It was boring and I expected Narration. Again thats my fault . OK but even so, this was so PC it was not even funny. Well it was funny, the joke was on myself for buying this trashy piece of garbage. They showed no kills, no mating, not even animals eating their kill. To call this THE ULTIMATE SAFARI is misleading. I would think at an ultimate safari you would experience the things I mentioned. Save your money on this one.",1234742400,,608,4.205128205128205
8346499,1,B00004REMO,"Do not buy this DVD! You will regret it. Even if it was free it would not be worth the space it takes up. This video is put together with random shots of wild animals put to music. There is no information, no narration, no story, nothing... Like a very boring, very long music video that features animals. The shots of animals are seemingly random, one moment showing hippos the next showing black bears and the next showing monkeys. I rented this from blockbluster online and I still feel ripped off. Completely Worthless.",1153353600,2,523,4.634408602150538
