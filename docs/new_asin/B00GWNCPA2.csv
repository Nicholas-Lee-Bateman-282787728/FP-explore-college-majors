8627987,4,B00GWNCPA2,"Video must be from about 1964. So don't expect 1080p quality. However, the details are good.

They go over the head shrug position, from doing it with your head on the mat to doing it so fast & hard it's a flip they call the high low.  They cover doing it from the sit out with explanations on what to do from different hand positions they may have grabbed you with (over arms, underhooks, etc), referee position, & while countering different breakdowns.

They have about 3 teachers showing the moves. 1 of them, the one with the glasses who first explains the head shrug position, is top notch in terms of quality & details. The other teacher, particularly the white haired gentleman, leave you desiring more explanation. For example, they don't go over any details at all in terms of how to catch the leg the way they do or how to optimaly control the final position to secure back points or the pin. One part is particularly upsetting, they very quickly show what can go wrong while you under the opponent and how to rock them around to counter their defenses to make them end In their back anyways. This was perhaps gonna be the most useful section yet it ended up being the most useless due to lack of explanation.

I took off 1 star but was almost tempted to take off 2 because of it.  Overall a good quality DVD for teaching despite its super old age. I have no regrets purchasing this dvd.",1454889600,,1397,4.42023346303502
