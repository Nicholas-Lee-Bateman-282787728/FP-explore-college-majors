8136995,5,B000H6SUYK,"The techniques shown are filmed well technically. Each technique shown incorporated several individual techniques (ie: block, punch, kick, punch, punch).  Because of this I feel the DVD is more appropriate for an intermediate student who desires inspiration on how develop his or her own routines. I very much enjoyed how different disciplines were showcased. I am impressed as how there are more similarities than differences.  I bought this disk based on my admiration for Grandmaster Yates. I have and constantly use his book: ""The Complete Book of Taekwon Do Forms"".",1365206400,,570,5.322222222222222
8136996,5,B000H6SUYK,"Really great instruction video, very easy learning technique for practicing at home. I recently relocated and haven't found a dojo that I like enough, or that fits my schedule, this video helps out a lot and teaches many different different types of martial arts.",1351814400,,263,5.0
8136997,4,B000H6SUYK,"This is a great dvd tool for martial artists w/training to chose combinations of kicking/punching (grappling too) to practice.
It's set on a basic wooden floor with a blue curtain behind. The production of video, camera angles & sound are great. They have one teach & the other the opponent. The teacher tells you what moves they use & why as they do it in slow motion, and then show you normal speed. Then on tho the next combo. There is no excess chatter or dragging on to fill content. There is plenty to learn.
The form/grace of all the teachers & opponents are great.
The chapters included are basic, kicking, women's, aikido, japanese karate, okinawan pressure-point fighting, kempo, jujutsu, judo & some of their favorites.",1181865600,2,730,4.801587301587301
