3103560,5,B0013D8M3U,Love the series and you cant beat the prices and quick delivery here on Amazon.  I have gotten so many friends and family turned on to Amazon and they agree.,1212537600,2,157,4.233333333333333
3103561,4,B0013D8M3U,I was a little disappointed in the number of shows in the season.  The shows are great that are there.  Amazon was super at getting the disc to me quickly and even gave me a credit on a new reduced price.  Thanks Amazon.,1212364800,2,220,4.069767441860465

3103563,5,B0013D8M3U,"Season three was by far the best season to date (seasons 1-5).  Mainly because of the character Mia played by Emmanuelle Vaugier.  AKA; without a doubt, the biggest mistake Charlie has made yet.  And the show has never had a better recurring guest role than that of Mia.  With that said, every season (again, to date) was great, but season three beats 1,2,4 & 5 - hands down.",1212192000,3,375,4.470588235294118
3103564,5,B0013D8M3U,"I discovered this show about a year ago and quickly became a fan. I ordered season 1&2 which I greatly enjoyed. Season three is funny but not as funny as the first two season. Overall, the first three seasons are well worth buying in my opinion.",1212019200,,245,4.3478260869565215
3103565,5,B0013D8M3U,"This is a well written, well acted, well produced show. This series will be a TV classic. Look forward to more DVD's.",1211155200,,117,4.363636363636363
3103566,5,B0013D8M3U,"I've reviewed the other two seasons because I love this show so much, and this season still has it.  It's managed to stay fresh and funny and still thoroughly enjoyable.  The majority of main cast members have recieved Emmy nominations and it's not hard to see why.
Here is a run down of the episodes in this dvd set;

WEEKEND IN BANGKOK WITH TWO OLYMPIC GYMNASTS - After Alan falls off the roof, Charlie has to look after the adolescent and increasingly obnoxious Jake for the weekend.

PRINCIPAL GALLAGHER'S LEZBIAN LOVER - Alan has to lobby the principal to keep Jake from getting expelled, while Charlie is left to manage the chiropractic office for the day.

CARPET BURNS AND A BITE MARK - After it's revealed Alan and Judith have been trying to reconcile, Charlie, Evelyn, and Rose vie for the role of spoiler.

YOUR DISMISSIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS B**BS - Alan looks for a new place after he invites Berta to stay at Charlie's house, bringing the brothers to blows.

WE CALLED IT MR PINKY - Charlie's inability to reciprocate his girlfriend's love forces him to examine his relationships with women.

HI, MR HORNED ONE - Charlie's Satan-worshiping girlfriend has a knack for the supernatural, and seems to be the cause of some strange happenings around the Harper house.

SLEEP TIGHT, PUDDIN POP - Charlie gets drunk and sleeps with Rose on her birthday. Rose says she knows it's no big deal. But her father quickly shows up at Charlie's house, under the impression that they've been dating for two years.

THAT VOODOO THAT I DO DO - Charlie bribes Jake into taking ballet lessons so he can vie for the affections of the teacher. Things go awry, however, when Charlie and Jake find themselves competing for those affections.

MADAME AND HER SPECIAL FRIEND - Charlie's elderly neighbor has an uncomfortable business proposition for Alan.

SANTA'S VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED - Alan's girlfriend Sandy is Malibu's answer to Martha Stewart, causing Alan and Charlie to pack on the pounds. Their desire for her fabulous culinary output is ultimately overwhelmed her craziness.

THAT SPECIAL TUG - After a disastrous evening out with his brother, Charlie decides it is time to see a shrink.

HUMILIATION IS A VISUAL MEDIUM - Charlie has to decide whether he can really commit to a serious relationship with Mia, especially when sex is currently off the agenda. Unsurprisingly, his suggestion that he sleep with other women in the meantime falls on somewhat stony ground.

LOVE ISN'T BLIND, IT'S RETARDED - As Charlie tries to receive his version of benefits from the relationship he has with Mia, Allen starts dating Charlie's most recent ex-girlfriend.

MY TONGUE IS MEAT - Forced to hide in his garage to enjoy a brace of beers and half a Cuban cigar, Charlie's attempts to keep his unhealthy lifestyle habits secret from Mia fall apart when she smells bacon on his breath, resulting in their first major argument since taking their relationship to a physical plane.

ERGO, THE BOOTY CALL - As Jake's twelfth birthday approaches, Alan is still smiling ear-to-ear over his sex life with 22 year-old hottie Kandi, even when he's forced to explain to his son what a ""booty call"" is. Meanwhile, Jake celebrates with a sip of coffee and a handful of vitamins - or at least, that's what he assumes the blue pills in his dad's bathroom cabinet are, with the ""V"" imprinted. Like Berta says, he's going to need another party hat.

THE UNFORTUNATE LITTLE SCHNAUZER - At Alan's insistence and to avoid having to escort the daughter of one of ma's clients (she invited that), Charlie attends with Alan, ma and Jake the jingle awards ceremony, where he's nominated and just knows Archie Baldwin will win for the seventh year in a row, because that pompous ass always gets the sexy products, a good tune for medication like Charlie's clients is never good enough to get a fair chance. He's right, and was forced by Rose -who will otherwise stalk him again- to make her adoring teenage boyfriend Gordon give her some private space again; when that works, she changes her mind...

THE SPIT-COVERED COBBLER - Alan finally has an attractive date, 22 year-old Kandi, but she's even dumber then Jake, and as Charlie rightly points out girls that age are extremely high maintenance. Charlie has his fun seeing Alan struggle with the growing pile of bills, driving him to raid Jake's mammoth piggy bank and taking a second job as pizza deliverer, but still helps his double-plucked brother when wicked ex Judith insists on alimony. Alas Kandi...

GOLLY MOSES, SHE'S A MUFFIN - The Harpers's world is inverted: Charlie's ex Kandi, of his countless girls about the dumbest, not only became Alan's lover but even says she prefers sex with him, and has been living in Charlie's beach-house, as unnoticed as several furniture changes, for three weeks since she was evicted. Charlie has suffered a sexual drought even longer, by now even Berta and her cousin in prison begin to look somehow attractive. Judith finds out, and is shocked Jake is exposed to such a floozy; despite his brother's warning to keep love and business apart, Alan tries her as secretary in his surgery, with even more and worse results then either could fear...

ALWAYS A BRIDESMAIN NEVER A BURRO - Alan is made to admit to Charlie, who keeps hitting it in, he has hit rock-bottom now his brainless girlfriend Kandi has moved in with his ex. It's all so confusing that Jake would prefer dad's ladies to be lesbians, then tells him Kandi's ma Mandi has joined Charlie's endless list of sexual conquests. Alan can't talk to Kandi, she just repeats Judith's phrases, clearly without understanding the words, but he sees her dad, Mandi's ex Andy, arrive on blind date with his own ex Judith. Frolicking finale at Judith's, in rooms, bed and hot-tub...

AND THE PLOT MOISTENS - Alan turns to Jake's teacher for stimulating conversation, since Kandi obviously can't provide any. But the teacher starts to get the wrong idea about Alan's intentions.

JUST ONCE WITH AUNT SOPHIE - Jake has his first boys-girls party, dating a smart girl, Wendy Cho. Alan was looking forward to coaching his son, but even Jake, who spends his schooldays watching the clock tick, isn't dumb enough to consider dating advice from the worst womanizer in L.A., while Charlie proves he can coach a virtually hopeless case -Alan and Judith's genes without the IQ- trough appearance, dance and anything else. In fact Alan envies Jake so much, he still hopes for ...

ARGUMENTS FOR THE QUICKIE - Mia comes back and asks Charlie to donate his sperm. He agrees to, but for some unknown reason he can't deliver.

THAT PISTOL-PACKIN' HERMAPHRODITE - Charlie and Mia discover that setting up a wedding with their two crazy families is a disaster, so they decide to get married in Las Vegas.

If you are a fan of this show, you'll still love this season.  They still continue to deliver hilarious lines and great acting.  Jake is brilliant and one of my favourite characters, but it's still Charlie who steals every scene for me.  He's so funny and delivers his performances with impecable comic timing.  I love this programme and you'll love it too (I hope).",1204416000,49,7160,4.811735941320293
3103567,5,B0013D8M3U,"I don't understand the realise policy of movie company's.
In the US they will realise the dvd-set of season 3 on May 13, 2008.
When in Europe they realised it on January 6, 2008.
But season 3 was on the cable in the US in 2005/2006, correct?
Why realise the dvd in 2008? Why wait so long?
How many seasons did they already show on the US cable?
When will I see season 4, because season 3 ended will a great cliffhanger!

I hope they will realise the dvd-sets in the near future a bitt sooner.

""Ergo, the booty call"" gets me laughing so hard I almost wet myself!  And the episode I refer to as ""22, Good for you!"" when Kandi's car catches fire and then she needs a root canal.  This season also contains some of my favorite episodes for Charlie, including ""Hi, Mr. Horned One""!

3103743,5,B0013D8M3U,"Two and a Half Men was really funny when Charlie Sheen was in his role on the sitcom, and Angus Young was also priceless as the young kid. Charlie of course did a terrible thing reciting his own anger at one of the producers. Anybody, technical people or actors, that you definitely do not offend a producer of a show. I half wonder if Charlie and Angus knew that Angus' age would make him not a little kid anymore, and the show would not be nearly as funny, so they made a pact-decision with one of the producers of the TV show. Charlie would be upset, he would be fired from the show, Angus didn't have to be on the show nearly as much, and the show would deal with the outcome of any ""shenanigans"" that the public might perceive happened. In my opinion maybe, that one of the producers wasn't really mad, Charlie didn't really offend one of the producers, and the show has gone on regardless of how Charlie's' character would be ""eliminated"" from the cast. I have not liked the show since. It's not nearly close to being funny anymore, which is probably what the producers, Angus, and Charlie knew it would be, and they decided to make a ""disaster"" of Charlie's character going away, dying as it was made.",1378598400,,1208,4.42152466367713
3103744,5,B0013D8M3U,"Only thing I dislike about this show is the misogynistic and somewhat homophobic writing. Most of the women on the show are stereotypes (Chelsea, Mia, Charlie's girlfriends). Thankfully, there are also several strong and highly gifted female characters on the show such as Evelyn, Berta, Rose, and others.

This season includes the episode called ""That Special Tug"", which is one of my favorites. It's the one where Alan has an emotional breakdown at the movie theater, the bookstore, and in the car, forcing Charlie to dump him by the side of the road. Then Charlie goes to see a therapist, played by Jane Lynch - hilarious!",1378512000,,625,4.89622641509434

3103788,4,B0013D8M3U,"Chuck Lorre is a brilliant man; a complex but calm man who has realized that as the boss in a performing arts company he must remain calm and staid because almost no one else will, He got his start, as most of the Hollywood writing staff did, on Roseanne, where his writing skills were honed under the demands of a woman who planned out an entire series between season two and three.
Roseanne was making a plug for women's rights and it centered on the fact that women were capable of doing just about anything. Sadly, in the late 80'ws and early 90's the methods she used were by making men seem like idiots. John Goodman is not only a brilliant actor and a man who clearly wanted out of his  contract in season nine, managed to come across as a wonderful man; a feminist who refused to give up his maleness. Still, we watched Roseanne hit him in the head with a cast iron skillet one too many times. When Roseanna (who had a philosophy that any writer had one or two good season in him and then it was time to cut him loose- she was wrong) released Lorre, he went on to create Dharma and Greg, Becker, Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. Lorre manages to do well by surrounding himself with outstanding people and allowing them to do their jobs. There is plenty of laughter on the set and Charlie Sheen aside, there are no ""stars"" on his shows. The Big Bang Theory is an excellent example of ensemble work we haven't seen since Marta Kaufman and David Crane gave us ""Friends.""
 Two and a Half Men is about two unmarried brothers. Charlie (played by Charlie Sheen), two years older, who has managed a career as a musician writing jingles for advertising- bringing in vast amounts of money, a house on Malibu Beach and an endless supply of single malt scotch. Alan (Jon Cryer) is an anal retentive chiropractor- not quite a doctor- who was kicked out of his home a la Felix Unger by his wife of twelve years named Judith.(Marin Hatch) They share custody of a boy, Jake (expertly played by Angus T. Jones) whp is lazy, fraqnk and has the typical locker room humor of a young adolescent. The premise- at first- was to see how an adolescent boy would co-exist with a single uncle who is living with a Peter Pan comp-lex, bringing in woman after woman foir meaningless one night stands, developing a reputation where by almost anywhere he goes woman are saying ""Hi, Charlie"" or ""Charlie, you filthy creep! You ruined my life.""
 On the surface, Alan comes across as the better behaved of the two and we strongly suspect that Lorre intended this. However, Alan begins to make up for last time and despite the many jokes about Charlie thinking with his penis, we noticed that soon enough Alans penis was doing all of HIS thinking and at a substantially lower IQ than that of Charlie's. Aolan spends all of his time comp0laining about how easily things come to Charlie while he has had t5o dfight for every single failure in his life. What is left to us to see is that Charlie has just as many challenges and failures as Alan but has learned not to complain about them. His relaxed attitude serves him better than Alan's constant anxiety and explosive diarrhea. Still, it is often Charlie who gets a surprise trip to the Emergency room. Charlie is the one who's got a stalker and had his testicles super glued to his thighs. Charlie is the one who is a kind man and wants nothing more than kindness in return. Alan is unable to see this and thus feels great jealousy about the fact that he feels that he struggles and struggles, loses everything, while Charlie has gold falling from the sky.
 Alan wastes every opportunity he has. His second marriage comes about a year and a half after Judith has thrown him out and he ends up in a weekend long sex marathon with a girl whose body is spectacular and her very loe I.Q. somehow makes her even more sexy. She is enamored by Alan;s sweetness and doesn;lt mind that she is half his age. She struts around the house in a bikini, to the delight of young Jakes and, during a foolish moment in Las Vegas, Alan marries her. Fifteen minutes later a single coin in the slot wins him a half million dollars and then four months after that she has thrown him out and he has eleven dollars left.;
 And Charlie is the fool?
 The show doesn't make any attempts to teach us lessons and this is nice. After all we wept through Family Ties, M*A*S*H*, Designing Women and even Roseanna, but it is nice to have a TV series where there is never any growth- a pure half hour of comedy.
 As each season passes we see that both men are destroyed by childhood issues stemming from a terrible mother played expertly by the clkassic Holland Taylor). The boys father died when they were swtill in elementary school by food poisoning of fish. ""( I was a new housewife and learning to cook, "": Said Evelyn- their mother, ""How was I to know that fish couldn't be kept in a drawer? ""
 Charlie contends that his father KNEW the fish was bad and he ate it anyway. Alan refuses to discuss it. After his death came a string of ""Uncles"" who helped to raise the boys. Alan became the type A child who did anything he could to please but never succeeded. Charlie simply began to drink and have indiscriminate sex. They endured boarding school, Charlie got out as fast as he could and Alan married a duplicate of his mother. Alan gets reamed for both Alimony and Child Support. He loses the house, all the money, the furniture and the car. Why? Because Charlie couldn't heolp himself and slept with, then dumped, Alan;s attorney.
 Similar episodes occurred with Jake's Karate teacher, den mother, fifth grade teacher and countless others. Charlie falls in love more often and Alan ends up in terrible situations because off his loud but stupid penis. (a true highlight is his venture into computer dating when Alison JAnney plays a date who leaves, saying good night to Charlie, explaining she has to get up for work and that Alan has turned into bed for the night. Charlie who is plagued by being in love with a ballet dancer who will be traveling, enters Alan's room to see him cuffed at fours in red stockings, arm gloves and leather corset and panties.
 Alison Janney is an excellent example of the remarkable guest stars that visit this show. Martin Sheen plays an emotionally unbalanced father of Charlie's stalker, Rose (perhaps the gem of the series), Robert Wagner plays the boys father and as a result of a fun conversation between Chuck Lorre and the creator of CSI, a switch of writing staffs occur creating a hysterical episode here and a wonderful CSI parody. CLoris Leachman  moves in next door, Sean Penn and Elvis Costello play themselves in a support group with Charlie. Martin Mull is a remarkable pharmacist trying to compete with the larger chains and copes by delving into the sample drawers. He pays three sets of alimony but not a cent of child support. It goes on and on.
 The gem of the series is Conchetta Ferrall who plays Berta, Charlie's housekeeper who does much more than keeps house. She is part of the family and her wit and wisdom is curt and cute. Nothing disgusts her (one morning after finding a bra abd panties on the kitchen table with the bananas and the butter says, ""Good God, I'm workin;' for Caligula."" She's a good woman, the mother of a handful of failure girls for whom she'd face a meth chemist to extort $5,000 in pre-paid child support. She could have only five lines in a scene and still manage to steal it. The house can't run without Berta and she and Charlie have a strong relationship, well defined and honed over the course of many years.
 Okay. The writing is full of 8th grade fart jokes but they're cleverly written so that one must delve into intelligence to get the meaning. There's a great deal of gas, as a result of a 12 year old boy who will (and can) eat anything and has no shame. We have watched only up to season six and we suppose that there's not a soul in America who has not heard of the medical condition that crashed Charlie Sheen. We have not seen that final season as his illness took him down nor have we viewed any of the new seasons with the adorable and perpetually adolescent Ashton Kutcher. The series is approaching it';s 200tgh episode, something rarely seen in television so that there are 8 seasons before Mr Sheen's illness affects the show- if at all. We will revisit this subject when the time comes, but in the mean time, score this one as a way of understanding men- of making up for the men hating Roseanne and at looking at two emotionally damaged men and why. All the women in this series are depicted as equally damaged with the expception of Berta and Charlie's stalker. There is the regular appearance of a therapist- a [psychiatrist who still does therapy at $250 an hour and from time to time all two and a half men have sat with her. She played a phys ed teacher on Old Christine and now has a lead in the show Glee- the only actress in Hollywood taller than Alison Janney, she spends most of her scenes seated in her expensive chair making jokes at the expens fo Charlie or Alan and helping them to come to terms with what haunts them.
 Yes, it took us years to open our arms to Two and a half Men because at first, it appears to be arm-pit farts and network Pokys, but it is ever so much more. This is a good one for everyone and even more so for any man who has been under the control over the stronger sex.",1356652800,,9421,4.438150289017341

3103815,3,B0013D8M3U,"When it comes to TV, there aren't too many shows I follow anymore. Men's been one of the chosen programs I'll make time for, but now that the Charlie Sheen era is obviously over I would just like to grab the eight or so seasons of the show that currently exist and call it a day. After immensely enjoying seasons one and two on DVD, I picked up season three even though it was a little more expensive than the previous seasons. After watching it I wish I had waited for a price drop. To put it plainly, season three of Two and Half Men is good, but some of the story arcs are insipid.

The trouble beings in ""That Voodoo That I Do Do"" picks up in ""Humiliation is a Visual Medium"" through """"My Tongue is Meat"" and finally ends with ""Arguments for the Quickie"" and ""That Pistol-Packin' Hermaphrodite."" In case you don't catch the connection between those episodes, they're the ones centered on Charlie's ""no-sex"" relationship with Mia. Introduce a terrible character and just watch how terrible things get. I'm not saying there isn't any fun to be had in these episodes, but the bad starts to outweigh the good even with dimwitted Kandi entering the picture.

Adding to the negatives are boorish guest appearances by Cloris Leachman (""Madame and Her Special Friend"") and Jon Lovitz (""The Unfortunate Little Schnauser"") that only serve to annoy and make one reflect back on and wish for the brilliant Charlie, Jake and Alan-based episodes that start off the set. If anything, season three tries a bit too hard and over complicates a simple formula that hasn't hit its expiration date yet. Generally, the problematic episodes are fine enough when seen on TV where they don't play in order and quick succession of one another but in an environment where they do their weaknesses are quickly punished.

If you love Two and Half Men, then you're going to buy all the seasons regardless of what you read, but I can't lie to myself about the backwards step season three takes when trying to make its characters more complex. All I can hope for is season four fairs better in package form than this and actually comes with an episode guide.",1309219200,2,2130,4.62962962962963

And as sit-coms go these days, that sure isn't something you see a lot. I think this show is a bit of a left over from the classics of the mid to late 90's. And now that Friends and Frasier are getting more and more distant, and only Scrubs and the animated shows (simpsons and family guy) seem fairly safe from the network axes, it's nice and comforting to have Charlie and Alan around.

So my simple suggestion is this, buy this DVD! It's fun! So there.",1214438400,,583,4.243243243243243

3338063,5,B0013D8M3U,"I've reviewed the other two seasons because I love this show so much, and this season still has it.  It's managed to stay fresh and funny and still thoroughly enjoyable.  The majority of main cast members have recieved Emmy nominations and it's not hard to see why.
Here is a run down of the episodes in this dvd set;

WEEKEND IN BANGKOK WITH TWO OLYMPIC GYMNASTS - After Alan falls off the roof, Charlie has to look after the adolescent and increasingly obnoxious Jake for the weekend.

PRINCIPAL GALLAGHER'S LEZBIAN LOVER - Alan has to lobby the principal to keep Jake from getting expelled, while Charlie is left to manage the chiropractic office for the day.

CARPET BURNS AND A BITE MARK - After it's revealed Alan and Judith have been trying to reconcile, Charlie, Evelyn, and Rose vie for the role of spoiler.

YOUR DISMISSIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS B**BS - Alan looks for a new place after he invites Berta to stay at Charlie's house, bringing the brothers to blows.

WE CALLED IT MR PINKY - Charlie's inability to reciprocate his girlfriend's love forces him to examine his relationships with women.

HI, MR HORNED ONE - Charlie's Satan-worshiping girlfriend has a knack for the supernatural, and seems to be the cause of some strange happenings around the Harper house.

SLEEP TIGHT, PUDDIN POP - Charlie gets drunk and sleeps with Rose on her birthday. Rose says she knows it's no big deal. But her father quickly shows up at Charlie's house, under the impression that they've been dating for two years.

THAT VOODOO THAT I DO DO - Charlie bribes Jake into taking ballet lessons so he can vie for the affections of the teacher. Things go awry, however, when Charlie and Jake find themselves competing for those affections.

MADAME AND HER SPECIAL FRIEND - Charlie's elderly neighbor has an uncomfortable business proposition for Alan.

SANTA'S VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED - Alan's girlfriend Sandy is Malibu's answer to Martha Stewart, causing Alan and Charlie to pack on the pounds. Their desire for her fabulous culinary output is ultimately overwhelmed her craziness.

THAT SPECIAL TUG - After a disastrous evening out with his brother, Charlie decides it is time to see a shrink.

HUMILIATION IS A VISUAL MEDIUM - Charlie has to decide whether he can really commit to a serious relationship with Mia, especially when sex is currently off the agenda. Unsurprisingly, his suggestion that he sleep with other women in the meantime falls on somewhat stony ground.

LOVE ISN'T BLIND, IT'S RETARDED - As Charlie tries to receive his version of benefits from the relationship he has with Mia, Allen starts dating Charlie's most recent ex-girlfriend.

MY TONGUE IS MEAT - Forced to hide in his garage to enjoy a brace of beers and half a Cuban cigar, Charlie's attempts to keep his unhealthy lifestyle habits secret from Mia fall apart when she smells bacon on his breath, resulting in their first major argument since taking their relationship to a physical plane.

ERGO, THE BOOTY CALL - As Jake's twelfth birthday approaches, Alan is still smiling ear-to-ear over his sex life with 22 year-old hottie Kandi, even when he's forced to explain to his son what a ""booty call"" is. Meanwhile, Jake celebrates with a sip of coffee and a handful of vitamins - or at least, that's what he assumes the blue pills in his dad's bathroom cabinet are, with the ""V"" imprinted. Like Berta says, he's going to need another party hat.

THE UNFORTUNATE LITTLE SCHNAUZER - At Alan's insistence and to avoid having to escort the daughter of one of ma's clients (she invited that), Charlie attends with Alan, ma and Jake the jingle awards ceremony, where he's nominated and just knows Archie Baldwin will win for the seventh year in a row, because that pompous ass always gets the sexy products, a good tune for medication like Charlie's clients is never good enough to get a fair chance. He's right, and was forced by Rose -who will otherwise stalk him again- to make her adoring teenage boyfriend Gordon give her some private space again; when that works, she changes her mind...

THE SPIT-COVERED COBBLER - Alan finally has an attractive date, 22 year-old Kandi, but she's even dumber then Jake, and as Charlie rightly points out girls that age are extremely high maintenance. Charlie has his fun seeing Alan struggle with the growing pile of bills, driving him to raid Jake's mammoth piggy bank and taking a second job as pizza deliverer, but still helps his double-plucked brother when wicked ex Judith insists on alimony. Alas Kandi...

GOLLY MOSES, SHE'S A MUFFIN - The Harpers's world is inverted: Charlie's ex Kandi, of his countless girls about the dumbest, not only became Alan's lover but even says she prefers sex with him, and has been living in Charlie's beach-house, as unnoticed as several furniture changes, for three weeks since she was evicted. Charlie has suffered a sexual drought even longer, by now even Berta and her cousin in prison begin to look somehow attractive. Judith finds out, and is shocked Jake is exposed to such a floozy; despite his brother's warning to keep love and business apart, Alan tries her as secretary in his surgery, with even more and worse results then either could fear...

ALWAYS A BRIDESMAIN NEVER A BURRO - Alan is made to admit to Charlie, who keeps hitting it in, he has hit rock-bottom now his brainless girlfriend Kandi has moved in with his ex. It's all so confusing that Jake would prefer dad's ladies to be lesbians, then tells him Kandi's ma Mandi has joined Charlie's endless list of sexual conquests. Alan can't talk to Kandi, she just repeats Judith's phrases, clearly without understanding the words, but he sees her dad, Mandi's ex Andy, arrive on blind date with his own ex Judith. Frolicking finale at Judith's, in rooms, bed and hot-tub...

AND THE PLOT MOISTENS - Alan turns to Jake's teacher for stimulating conversation, since Kandi obviously can't provide any. But the teacher starts to get the wrong idea about Alan's intentions.

JUST ONCE WITH AUNT SOPHIE - Jake has his first boys-girls party, dating a smart girl, Wendy Cho. Alan was looking forward to coaching his son, but even Jake, who spends his schooldays watching the clock tick, isn't dumb enough to consider dating advice from the worst womanizer in L.A., while Charlie proves he can coach a virtually hopeless case -Alan and Judith's genes without the IQ- trough appearance, dance and anything else. In fact Alan envies Jake so much, he still hopes for ...

ARGUMENTS FOR THE QUICKIE - Mia comes back and asks Charlie to donate his sperm. He agrees to, but for some unknown reason he can't deliver.

THAT PISTOL-PACKIN' HERMAPHRODITE - Charlie and Mia discover that setting up a wedding with their two crazy families is a disaster, so they decide to get married in Las Vegas.

If you are a fan of this show, you'll still love this season.  They still continue to deliver hilarious lines and great acting.  Jake is brilliant and one of my favourite characters, but it's still Charlie who steals every scene for me.  He's so funny and delivers his performances with impecable comic timing.  I love this programme and you'll love it too (I hope).",1204416000,49,7160,4.811735941320293

In the US they will realise the dvd-set of season 3 on May 13, 2008.
When in Europe they realised it on January 6, 2008.
But season 3 was on the cable in the US in 2005/2006, correct?
Why realise the dvd in 2008? Why wait so long?
How many seasons did they already show on the US cable?
When will I see season 4, because season 3 ended will a great cliffhanger!

I hope they will realise the dvd-sets in the near future a bitt sooner.

3338240,5,B0013D8M3U,"Two and a Half Men was really funny when Charlie Sheen was in his role on the sitcom, and Angus Young was also priceless as the young kid. Charlie of course did a terrible thing reciting his own anger at one of the producers. Anybody, technical people or actors, that you definitely do not offend a producer of a show. I half wonder if Charlie and Angus knew that Angus' age would make him not a little kid anymore, and the show would not be nearly as funny, so they made a pact-decision with one of the producers of the TV show. Charlie would be upset, he would be fired from the show, Angus didn't have to be on the show nearly as much, and the show would deal with the outcome of any ""shenanigans"" that the public might perceive happened. In my opinion maybe, that one of the producers wasn't really mad, Charlie didn't really offend one of the producers, and the show has gone on regardless of how Charlie's' character would be ""eliminated"" from the cast. I have not liked the show since.

Thankfully, there are also several strong and highly gifted female characters on the show such as Evelyn, Berta, Rose, and others.

This season includes the episode called ""That Special Tug"", which is one of my favorites. It's the one where Alan has an emotional breakdown at the movie theater, the bookstore, and in the car, forcing Charlie to dump him by the side of the road.

3338285,4,B0013D8M3U,"Chuck Lorre is a brilliant man; a complex but calm man who has realized that as the boss in a performing arts company he must remain calm and staid because almost no one else will, He got his start, as most of the Hollywood writing staff did, on Roseanne, where his writing skills were honed under the demands of a woman who planned out an entire series between season two and three.
Roseanne was making a plug for women's rights and it centered on the fact that women were capable of doing just about anything. Sadly, in the late 80'ws and early 90's the methods she used were by making men seem like idiots. John Goodman is not only a brilliant actor and a man who clearly wanted out of his  contract in season nine, managed to come across as a wonderful man; a feminist who refused to give up his maleness. Still, we watched Roseanne hit him in the head with a cast iron skillet one too many times. When Roseanna (who had a philosophy that any writer had one or two good season in him and then it was time to cut him loose- she was wrong) released Lorre, he went on to create Dharma and Greg, Becker, Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. Lorre manages to do well by surrounding himself with outstanding people and allowing them to do their jobs. There is plenty of laughter on the set and Charlie Sheen aside, there are no ""stars"" on his shows. The Big Bang Theory is an excellent example of ensemble work we haven't seen since Marta Kaufman and David Crane gave us ""Friends.""
 Two and a Half Men is about two unmarried brothers. Charlie (played by Charlie Sheen), two years older, who has managed a career as a musician writing jingles for advertising- bringing in vast amounts of money, a house on Malibu Beach and an endless supply of single malt scotch. Alan (Jon Cryer) is an anal retentive chiropractor- not quite a doctor- who was kicked out of his home a la Felix Unger by his wife of twelve years named Judith.(Marin Hatch) They share custody of a boy, Jake (expertly played by Angus T. Jones) whp is lazy, fraqnk and has the typical locker room humor of a young adolescent. The premise- at first- was to see how an adolescent boy would co-exist with a single uncle who is living with a Peter Pan comp-lex, bringing in woman after woman foir meaningless one night stands, developing a reputation where by almost anywhere he goes woman are saying ""Hi, Charlie"" or ""Charlie, you filthy creep! You ruined my life.""
 On the surface, Alan comes across as the better behaved of the two and we strongly suspect that Lorre intended this. However, Alan begins to make up for last time and despite the many jokes about Charlie thinking with his penis, we noticed that soon enough Alans penis was doing all of HIS thinking and at a substantially lower IQ than that of Charlie's. Aolan spends all of his time comp0laining about how easily things come to Charlie while he has had t5o dfight for every single failure in his life. What is left to us to see is that Charlie has just as many challenges and failures as Alan but has learned not to complain about them. His relaxed attitude serves him better than Alan's constant anxiety and explosive diarrhea. Still, it is often Charlie who gets a surprise trip to the Emergency room. Charlie is the one who's got a stalker and had his testicles super glued to his thighs. Charlie is the one who is a kind man and wants nothing more than kindness in return. Alan is unable to see this and thus feels great jealousy about the fact that he feels that he struggles and struggles, loses everything, while Charlie has gold falling from the sky.
 Alan wastes every opportunity he has. His second marriage comes about a year and a half after Judith has thrown him out and he ends up in a weekend long sex marathon with a girl whose body is spectacular and her very loe I.Q. somehow makes her even more sexy. She is enamored by Alan;s sweetness and doesn;lt mind that she is half his age. She struts around the house in a bikini, to the delight of young Jakes and, during a foolish moment in Las Vegas, Alan marries her. Fifteen minutes later a single coin in the slot wins him a half million dollars and then four months after that she has thrown him out and he has eleven dollars left.;
 And Charlie is the fool?
 The show doesn't make any attempts to teach us lessons and this is nice. After all we wept through Family Ties, M*A*S*H*, Designing Women and even Roseanna, but it is nice to have a TV series where there is never any growth- a pure half hour of comedy.
 As each season passes we see that both men are destroyed by childhood issues stemming from a terrible mother played expertly by the clkassic Holland Taylor). The boys father died when they were swtill in elementary school by food poisoning of fish. ""( I was a new housewife and learning to cook, "": Said Evelyn- their mother, ""How was I to know that fish couldn't be kept in a drawer? ""
 Charlie contends that his father KNEW the fish was bad and he ate it anyway. Alan refuses to discuss it. After his death came a string of ""Uncles"" who helped to raise the boys. Alan became the type A child who did anything he could to please but never succeeded. Charlie simply began to drink and have indiscriminate sex. They endured boarding school, Charlie got out as fast as he could and Alan married a duplicate of his mother. Alan gets reamed for both Alimony and Child Support. He loses the house, all the money, the furniture and the car. Why? Because Charlie couldn't heolp himself and slept with, then dumped, Alan;s attorney.
 Similar episodes occurred with Jake's Karate teacher, den mother, fifth grade teacher and countless others. Charlie falls in love more often and Alan ends up in terrible situations because off his loud but stupid penis. (a true highlight is his venture into computer dating when Alison JAnney plays a date who leaves, saying good night to Charlie, explaining she has to get up for work and that Alan has turned into bed for the night. Charlie who is plagued by being in love with a ballet dancer who will be traveling, enters Alan's room to see him cuffed at fours in red stockings, arm gloves and leather corset and panties.
 Alison Janney is an excellent example of the remarkable guest stars that visit this show. Martin Sheen plays an emotionally unbalanced father of Charlie's stalker, Rose (perhaps the gem of the series), Robert Wagner plays the boys father and as a result of a fun conversation between Chuck Lorre and the creator of CSI, a switch of writing staffs occur creating a hysterical episode here and a wonderful CSI parody. CLoris Leachman  moves in next door, Sean Penn and Elvis Costello play themselves in a support group with Charlie. Martin Mull is a remarkable pharmacist trying to compete with the larger chains and copes by delving into the sample drawers. He pays three sets of alimony but not a cent of child support. It goes on and on.
 The gem of the series is Conchetta Ferrall who plays Berta, Charlie's housekeeper who does much more than keeps house. She is part of the family and her wit and wisdom is curt and cute. Nothing disgusts her (one morning after finding a bra abd panties on the kitchen table with the bananas and the butter says, ""Good God, I'm workin;' for Caligula."" She's a good woman, the mother of a handful of failure girls for whom she'd face a meth chemist to extort $5,000 in pre-paid child support. She could have only five lines in a scene and still manage to steal it. The house can't run without Berta and she and Charlie have a strong relationship, well defined and honed over the course of many years.
 Okay. The writing is full of 8th grade fart jokes but they're cleverly written so that one must delve into intelligence to get the meaning. There's a great deal of gas, as a result of a 12 year old boy who will (and can) eat anything and has no shame. We have watched only up to season six and we suppose that there's not a soul in America who has not heard of the medical condition that crashed Charlie Sheen. We have not seen that final season as his illness took him down nor have we viewed any of the new seasons with the adorable and perpetually adolescent Ashton Kutcher. The series is approaching it';s 200tgh episode, something rarely seen in television so that there are 8 seasons before Mr Sheen's illness affects the show- if at all. We will revisit this subject when the time comes, but in the mean time, score this one as a way of understanding men- of making up for the men hating Roseanne and at looking at two emotionally damaged men and why. All the women in this series are depicted as equally damaged with the expception of Berta and Charlie's stalker. There is the regular appearance of a therapist- a [psychiatrist who still does therapy at $250 an hour and from time to time all two and a half men have sat with her. She played a phys ed teacher on Old Christine and now has a lead in the show Glee- the only actress in Hollywood taller than Alison Janney, she spends most of her scenes seated in her expensive chair making jokes at the expens fo Charlie or Alan and helping them to come to terms with what haunts them.
 Yes, it took us years to open our arms to Two and a half Men because at first, it appears to be arm-pit farts and network Pokys, but it is ever so much more. This is a good one for everyone and even more so for any man who has been under the control over the stronger sex.",1356652800,,9421,4.438150289017341

3338312,3,B0013D8M3U,"When it comes to TV, there aren't too many shows I follow anymore. Men's been one of the chosen programs I'll make time for, but now that the Charlie Sheen era is obviously over I would just like to grab the eight or so seasons of the show that currently exist and call it a day. After immensely enjoying seasons one and two on DVD, I picked up season three even though it was a little more expensive than the previous seasons. After watching it I wish I had waited for a price drop. To put it plainly, season three of Two and Half Men is good, but some of the story arcs are insipid.

The trouble beings in ""That Voodoo That I Do Do"" picks up in ""Humiliation is a Visual Medium"" through """"My Tongue is Meat"" and finally ends with ""Arguments for the Quickie"" and ""That Pistol-Packin' Hermaphrodite."" In case you don't catch the connection between those episodes, they're the ones centered on Charlie's ""no-sex"" relationship with Mia. Introduce a terrible character and just watch how terrible things get. I'm not saying there isn't any fun to be had in these episodes, but the bad starts to outweigh the good even with dimwitted Kandi entering the picture.

Adding to the negatives are boorish guest appearances by Cloris Leachman (""Madame and Her Special Friend"") and Jon Lovitz (""The Unfortunate Little Schnauser"") that only serve to annoy and make one reflect back on and wish for the brilliant Charlie, Jake and Alan-based episodes that start off the set. If anything, season three tries a bit too hard and over complicates a simple formula that hasn't hit its expiration date yet. Generally, the problematic episodes are fine enough when seen on TV where they don't play in order and quick succession of one another but in an environment where they do their weaknesses are quickly punished.

If you love Two and Half Men, then you're going to buy all the seasons regardless of what you read, but I can't lie to myself about the backwards step season three takes when trying to make its characters more complex. All I can hope for is season four fairs better in package form than this and actually comes with an episode guide.",1309219200,2,2130,4.62962962962963

3338423,5,B0013D8M3U,"I think this show goes from strenght to strenghts. The writing is sharp, the performances spot on, and it's just a lot of fun.

And as sit-coms go these days, that sure isn't something you see a lot. I think this show is a bit of a left over from the classics of the mid to late 90's. And now that Friends and Frasier are getting more and more distant, and only Scrubs and the animated shows (simpsons and family guy) seem fairly safe from the network axes, it's nice and comforting to have Charlie and Alan around.

So my simple suggestion is this, buy this DVD! It's fun! So there.",1214438400,,583,4.243243243243243
