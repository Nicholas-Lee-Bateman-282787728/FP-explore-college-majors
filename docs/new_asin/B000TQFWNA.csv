8210372,5,B000TQFWNA,This is a must-see interview. Ted Koppel did a great job interviewing General Romeo Dallaire. The general's insight and experiences regarding the Rwandan genocide and the underwhelming international response forces the viewer to consider many questions. It is very easy for many t say the words 'Never Again'. It is another to back those words up with the determination and force needed to make a difference. Many thanks to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum for making this interview possible and available.,1390953600,,517,5.317073170731708
