8324313,5,B000FZE3SK,I can't give these series enough praise.  The instructions are easy to follow and implement.,1227916800,,92,5.133333333333334
8324314,5,B000FZE3SK,"Another really good video from cookingondvd. Keeping in mind that the cooks are all professionals in India, don't expect to exactly duplicate their efforts. Idli trays are worth buying - I have a 3 tiered one. Use a pasta maker for the vermicelli or google for Indian cooking tools plus groceries. I use a can with holes punched in bottom to duplicate the Indian steamer. Jaggery = Mexican cone of br. sugar + some molasses (not blackstrap)or even dr. brown sugar + some molasses. Egg porota - make them about 1/2 as big so not hard to turn. My dosa are never as thin as shown but taste and smell wonderful. Try to visit an Indian grocery store for the smells and products - well worth a drive. This video couple have great videos at a decent price.",1193270400,2,749,4.434782608695652
