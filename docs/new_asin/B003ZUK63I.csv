8410996,5,B003ZUK63I,"Wow! I wish I had found Lee Holden and this wonderfully produced DVD years ago! I use it most mornings and find myself breathing much more deeply and channeling stress out of my body thru out the day with his wisdom and ease of learning these qi movements. I do wish the ""music only"" option included Lee going thru the routine so I could follow him. The option I use includes his soothing voice instruction. Highly recommend if you have digestive issues OR just need an intro to this ancient art and stress relief.",1504828800,2,514,4.4787234042553195
8410997,5,B003ZUK63I,"I did the workout yesterday and I really noticed a difference in my digestion. I had finished a big supper and I have had digestive problems all my life. It helps a lot and is very relaxing to do. Love the scenery. Simple slow exercises that gave me energy and I found that all of a sudden I was having more flow to my digestive organs, can't explain how better I felt in my belly but I did.",1496016000,2,391,4.0256410256410255
