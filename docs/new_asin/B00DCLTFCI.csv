5789219,4,B00DCLTFCI,"I respect Triple H and all he's done in wrestling. He also ruined my love for wrestling back in the early part of the decade with the whole McMahon-Hemsley era and in 2003 when he refused to lose the belt. It took Goldberg, a man who I never liked, to dethrone him for me to like him. Enough of my venting about Triple H.

The documentary starts off very strong, like most WWE dvds do. However, it gets to the chapter of The Rock then skips over the next few years of his career. The skip over his feuds with Stone Cold & Cactus Jack & go straight to Evolution. This could have been a 3 hour documentary and it would held my interest but it skipped over some major moments in his career. The matches are good but not as good as his other set The King of Kings. I do like the design of the set looks like something a metal band would do.

Anyways, the documentary is still good but missing some of his best years. The matches are good but not as the King of Kings dvd. Highly recommend it to wrestling fans, a very good set.",1380240000,2,1023,4.08457711442786

5789221,5,B00DCLTFCI,"I have watched a lot of WWE documentaries and in the last few years I had not been so excited as when I found out this DVD was coming out. ""Thy Kingdom Come"" tells the whole story of Paul Levesque ""Triple H"" since his early days before WCW, in WCW, and then WWF/E. It's over 3 hours long and its that ""Damn Good"" (no punt intended).

This is my second favorite WWE DVD right after CM Punk's Best In the World.",1380067200,2,409,4.049382716049383

5789223,5,B00DCLTFCI,"When WWE released HHH's DVD ""The King of Kings"" I was SO DISAPPOINTED. All it was really was some of his best matches with him briefly talking about stuff in between the matches. This DVD ""Thy Kingdom Come"" is just like Stone Cold Steve Austin's ""And that's the bottom Line"" DVD in that it goes behind the scenes and shows you his personal life and what things are like for him when the cameras go off. This DVD is amazing if you're a HHH fan or WWE fan in general. Honestly I'll say it's easily right up there with Stone Cold's DVD. It does include some of his best matches, but it's good that they're separate from the life story of HHH. IT'S TIME TO PLAY THE GAME!",1379980800,24,667,4.21875
5789224,5,B00DCLTFCI,"Looks awesome. Deff getting this for Christmas. I got Punk's last year, so maybe it'll become a sorta Christmas tradition getting a WWE documentary.",1377475200,,148,5.208333333333333
5789225,5,B00DCLTFCI,"Beware The Skull King, he is the vision behind you, beside you, leading you to damnation. The evolution of Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque has been a riveting journey. Years of hard work, dedication and sacrifice opened the door to achieving his dreams, but his rise to power was not without a fair share of challenges.

The Game had to shed his blue blood image before rallying an army of fellow Degenerates and ultimately becoming the King of Kings. He deflected the criticism and forged ahead when he became part of the McMahon WWE Dynasty to embrace his executive role as WWE Chief Operating Officer. For Triple H, thy kingdom has truly come.

5789244,4,B00DCLTFCI,"A pretty good DVD overall but there is room for improvement.  I am a big fan of Triple H and regard him as one of the best of all time but the DVD had 3 flaws:
1. It doesn't portray a balanced view of The Game.  It only provides you with his version of the story backed up by positive comments from his allies: Foley, Taker, Rock, Michaels, Lesnar, Cena, Flair, Stephanie, Vince etc.  He doesn't address all the speculation as to whether he used his backstage stroke to keep guys down or to advance his career.
2.  Although a lot of time is spent delving into his relationship with Stephanie but there is absolute no mention of Chyna at all.
3. The selection of matches leaves out some of his more career defining ones such as his two matches against Mick Foley in 2000 which made his career and his epic match with Undertaker in 2012.
Overall, it does a good job of portraying Triple H in the most positive light possible and has some excellent video footage.  It would be a great video for people who don't know much about the Game's career but it lacks a little for those of us that do know the basic components of his professional body of work.",1420156800,,1148,4.296296296296297

5789252,4,B00DCLTFCI,"NOTE: This is a one disc version of the previously released 3 disc set featuring only the documentary that was included on the original set.

As I've stated in previous reviews of products involving him in that when looking at what he does in the ring from bell to bell, Triple H is one of the best performers in ""sports entertainment"" & has been for close to 2 decades as he's a true student of the game (no pun intended) & recently shown that behind the scenes with the innovations & improvement of various areas inside WWE (just ask Bruno Sammartino) so here's a look at his life & career featuring various comments from his parents, William Regal, Harley Race, Road Dogg, Diamond Dallas Page, Terry Taylor, Big Show, Vince McMahon, Kevin Nash, Sean Waltman, Shawn Michaels, Jim Ross, Michael Hayes, Mick Foley, Billy Gunn, The Rock, Pat Patterson, Linda McMahon, Ric Flair, Batista, Randy Orton, John Cena, Brock Lesnar, the directors & members of the cast from both ""Inside Out"" & ""The Chaperone"" including Michael Rapaport & Bruce Dern, and Undertaker who breaks character & speaks on a DVD set for the first time in a decade.

The documentary beings talking about Triple H growing up as a kid recalling the first wrestler he remembers seeing & how he got into working out & bodybuilding at a young age followed by the impact of a former bodybuilder & wrestler named Ted Arcedi had on him leading to getting trained by Killer Kowalski & how he got the name ""Terra Ryzing."" The connections made through his gym leading into WCW was discussed next with various talents talking about the first impressions made & how the character ""Jean-Paul Levesque"" with the big highlights talking about why he turned down his initial contract offer & the unusual reason he left. Hunter-Hearst Helmsley was discussed next in how he was brought right in & given a spot before talking about being invited into ""The Kliq"" with Kevin Nash making the funny comment about how his healthy lifestyle would benefit them before going into the details of why he was punished for the infamous ""curtain call"" & how it could have been worse than what it was followed by he thought behind the idea & initial reactions of Chyna along with how his matches with Mankind helped evolve his character. The details of D-Generation X was heavily discussed from of how they kept getting in trouble for the rings they did, how things finally turned out for them to him, eventually taking over as the leader of the group & elevating everyone in the group through association, the WCW invasion, and how the feud against The Rock & The Nation elevated the Intercontinental Championship. His evolution into ""The Game"" was talked about next from how the rest of DX reacted to the idea, the backstage politics behind his first WWE Title win & going into how the idea for the wedding angle with Stephane came along before talking about how the storyline between the two turned into a real life romance revealing who actually noticed what was going on between the two before anyone else did including Triple H & Stephanie, how they actually had to fight for their relationship including the risk he took to date her, and actual footage from their wedding. The documentary continued talking about how the feud between him & The Rock over the WWE Championship was a real life struggle for each man wanting to be the top guy in the company before going into the quad injury & rehab in 2001 and his return to Madison Square Garden in 2002 followed by the formation of Evolution from the thought of reviving Flair's career to elevating Batista & Randy Orton though teaching & association. D-Generation X's return is heavy discussed next in how they pulled it off knowing they weren't the same people they were a decade earlier, if it was watered down, and how they felt the critics missed the point of the comedy they were doing before going into his second quad injury followed by talking about the feud with Randy Orton in detail such as incorporating his real life marriage to Stephanie into the storyline & what went wrong in their WrestleMania 25 match. His transition into acting is discussed from how it almost happened a few times earlier & before taking about his roles in movies from ""Blade III"" to the WWE movies ""The Chaperone"" & ""Inside Out"" before talking about his back to back WrestleMania matches with Undertaker from the story told from the first match to the next & the meaning behind the tagline ""End Of An Era."" His transition from in-ring competitor to Chief Operating Officer role his heavily discussed next as far as how & why it happened along with going over some of the changes he's made as far as breeding the next generation of WWE Superstars with the revamped NXT & developmental center along with balancing his heavy career schedule with his personal life with Stephanie & his daughters before ending it with various closing thoughts on Triple H.

In the end, I really liked the presentation with the treat of actually hearing from Undertaker was so I would highly recommend.",1409702400,,5057,4.72480181200453
5789253,5,B00DCLTFCI,The story of Triple H is a true tale of rags to riches. In wrestling you either love or hate the guy. Some view him as a hard working student of the game. Others as a back stabbing kiss ass who married his way into power. Whatever side your on you can't deny the impact he has made on the sports entertainment industry. Both in the ring and behind the scenes.,1407110400,,359,4.070422535211268
5789254,5,B00DCLTFCI,I like wrestling especially triple h he's the best wrestler in the world. I starting watching wwe when I was a kid.,1403654400,,115,4.2727272727272725

5789256,5,B00DCLTFCI,"Another good video by the WWE and another good HHH video. This one goes into his background. You meet his parents, DX days, his relationship with Steph and him being the COO. I really enjoyed it. If you are a HHH fan or wrestling fan get it. It shows that this man has goals and went out and did them.",1401753600,,301,4.033333333333333

5789269,5,B00DCLTFCI,This Bluray is essential for any Wrestling fan from the mid to late 90's. I don't currently watch the new wwe i find the story lines rather boring and uninteresting. Bluray has an extra match vs Brock Lesnar from wrestlmania 2012,1394755200,,229,4.609756097560975
5789270,5,B00DCLTFCI,I love the wwe and triple h is one of my favorite superstars. The documentary was awesome!! Pretty good matches on there too!!,1394323200,,126,4.521739130434782
5789271,1,B00DCLTFCI,"This is basically a slick PR campaign for Triple H the Chief Operating Officer. I watched this knowing full well that this video documentary would give a totally one-sided view of Triple-H's experience in the WWE. But this video totally leaves out a lot of things that Triple H should have come clean with. We all already know a lot about the fact that he and Stephanie McMahon had a real life relationship during the time that there was a storyline relationship.  We all know about his ordeal with being punished for his out-of-character conduct after the infamous match in which he and heated ""rivals"" hugged before the adversaries' exodus to WCW. In pro wresting that is a sacrilegious move which ruins the fantasy for many viewers.
Yes, Triple H did admit that by marrying the boss' daughter he would have an asterisk next to his name for every achievement hence forward. That, though, can be seen in the dynamics of the show and it is fully embraced by Triple H in the way the show's storyline have evolved (or devolved, depending on how you see it). Given how Triple H's friends the Road Dogg and X-Pac have all of a sudden become the tag team champions without a real back story to back it up. It seems that he is rewarding this friends at the cost of sustaining a good storyline. We are now seeing storyline where former heated enemies are now inexplicably allies. Take for example, the storyline where Big Show became allies with Mark Henry, the man that supposedly took him out of commission through a brutal and merciless beating.
There is that omission that he had a relationship with Chyna prior to his relationship with Stephanie McMahon. By all accounts it was an affair as he and Chyna were still a couple. After this incident, Chyna supposedly left the WWE and rightfully so. By the way, Chyna will probably not receive a single red cent from her appearance on this video as WWE owns her character trademark. And at the end of this video Jim Ross, being the brown noser, calls Triple H a ""Hall of Famer"" as an individual. What kind of a man fools around on his girlfriend? Given that many skirt chasers will always be skirt chasers, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised that in the future Stephanie and Triple H divorce after an affair is discovered.
Then there is the glaring omission of Triple H's match with The Ultimate Warrior in Wrestlemania XII. Some would consider that a snob of one of the best body builders in WWE history. It is as if Triple H's vanity would not allow him to be placed next to one the greatest bodies in the ""sport"". We all know that Triple H prides himself for his physique. Quite frankly, Triple H is nowhere near the same class as The Ultimate Warrior. If you look at a photo of each wrestler side to side, you will see why he did not want to be shown next to him. That goes hand in hand with Triple H's stipulation that he be portrayed at no less than the absolute best when it comes to the video games that WWE puts out. How vain can one be?
If you are looking for a video with great footage of wrestling, you won't really find them here. There are a lot of excerpts from matches but they are just snips. This is a biopic more than an action-packed package. You won't see one of the usual WWE DVD packages filled with repeats of the same matches that were shown in many other DVD offerings. You can't really blame the WWE for putting out these DVD's replete with repeat coverages of matches that have been repackaged in other DVD's just placed in another context. They know that WWE collectors will purchase them regardless.
The production values of this DVD is top notch, in fact, better than most other WWE packages. It is obvious that Triple H made sure that his presentation was the best that WWE could offer. The only problem is that through omission he left out a lot of the story. He had an opportunity to come clean regarding some things that many fans and fellow wrestlers are left to wonder about. At best, this DVD is Triple H's side of the story with an asterisk next to it.",1391558400,7,4037,4.462787550744249

I must say that ""Thy Kingdom Come"" truly makes up for that.  The documentary gives you an in depth look at Triple H.  We hear from his family, from wrestlers and from the man himself. The documentary describes in detail how Triple H became interested in Wrestling as a child and how he made his way to the squared circle.  We go through the different phases of his career and also find out what he is doing behind the scenes of the WWE today.  I truly enjoyed this set and I think you will too.",1382227200,,705,4.154411764705882

5789340,4,B00DCLTFCI,"I've seen him ""entertain"" 4 times live(they don't say wrestle anymore) Much better than his previous 2disc offering as we get another great WWE documentary. Did i expect him to mention how he was still with Chyna when he first hooked up with Steph? No i didn't,but it is pointless to just mention her role as dx only. Matches are great as the WWF logo is no longer blurred and it's funny to see Fred Durst on the tron when Undertaker rolls out to generic music. The extras are nice with the exception of the Levesque game,and should've just been added to the original,but thats how most documentaries are now. Overall well worth the price.",1381795200,,639,4.565217391304348
5789341,2,B00DCLTFCI,"I'm the first to admit that most of the WrestleMania matches of any historical significance are overplayed and I get sick of hearing about them and seeing their matches take spots from DVD sets they release over and over. One exception though was I was really looking forward to Triple H talking about his first WrestleMania match with the Ultimate Warrior. However, if you're like me and were looking forward to this part of the documentary, you'll be sorely disappointed. In fact, they don't even mention WrestleMania until his match with Chris Jericho at WrestleMania X8. Kind of bizarre, but I'm guessing they had to skip talking about WrestleMania for awhile in order to omit talking about the Warrior match without raising a huge red flag. Very disappointing, considering Triple H has hardly talked about this match at all during his career. All there is is some brief footage of Triple H talking about this on the 2005 Ultimate Warrior DVD that was taken from WrestleMania All Day Long in 2000. How much of it was edited I have no clue, as I didn't see the show when it broadcasted and there's no Youtube footage of it. Other than that the set is very good, but to me that part of the documentary is a huge let down.",1380931200,,1223,4.614678899082569

5789345,5,B00DCLTFCI,"If you enjoyed the CM Punk, Mick Foley, Shawn Michaels, and/or Chris Jericho dvds then you will enjoy this Triple H dvd. The documentary is in the style of the previous wrestler dvds mentioned which is an interview ""shoot"" style as opposed to the mini-movie documentary style that some wrestling dvds use. If you already know a lot about Hunter's career then I'm not sure there will be many surprises for you in the interview. I will say though that I've been a Triple H fan since I watched his match at Wrestlemania 12 and there are things I learned from watching this dvd. Yes, if you're a fan of ""the Game"" you know the big facts about his career, however you'll learn some small things about those facts so don't blow off this dvd thinking you won't learn anything new or that you won't enjoy it.

The match selection is nice. It seems the big ones are in the selection along with some sleeper hits. Other reviewers have covered the match listings so I won't name all of them in this review but know that the match listing is what you would expect from a set that is largely about the documentary. A sleeper hit you'll enjoy is a match between HHH and Dude Love from ""One Night Only."" I didn't know about that match until this dvd and I have to say it's a great match. There are other well-known greats on this set like Hunter's Iron Man Match against the Rock which is just a phenomenal match and his Last Man Standing match with Michaels that is also phenomenal. Are there great matches missing from this set? Definitely, but if *every* great HHH match was in this set then the cost of it would be over a hundred dollars because it would be *at least* 8 dvds in length.

This is the HHH set I've been wanting for a long time now. There are two HHH dvds previous to this release and they were both good in that both had great matches but both of them lacked a solid documentary. Now, I have the documentary I've wanted along with excellent matches from ""the Game."" I'm satisfied.",1380499200,3,1984,4.373983739837398
5789346,5,B00DCLTFCI,"As I've stated in previous reviews of products involving him in that when looking at what he does in the ring from bell to bell, Triple H is one of the best performers in ""sports entertainment"" & has been for close to 2 decades as he's a true student of the game (no pun intended) & recently shown that behind the scenes with the innovations & improvement of various areas inside WWE (just ask Bruno Sammartino) so here's a look at his life & career featuring various comments from his parents, William Regal, Harley Race, Road Dogg, Diamond Dallas Page, Terry Taylor, Big Show, Vince McMahon, Kevin Nash, Sean Waltman, Shawn Michaels, Jim Ross, Michael Hayes, Mick Foley, Billy Gunn, The Rock, Pat Patterson, Linda McMahon, Ric Flair, Batista, Randy Orton, John Cena, Brock Lesnar, the directors & members of the cast from both ""Inside Out"" & ""The Chaperone"" including Michael Rapaport & Bruce Dern, and Undertaker who breaks character & speaks on a DVD set for the first time in a decade.

His evolution into ""The Game"" was talked about next from how the rest of DX reacted to the idea, the backstage politics behind his first WWE Title win & going into how the idea for the wedding angle with Stephane came along before talking about how the storyline between the two turned into a real life romance revealing who actually noticed what was going on between the two before anyone else did including Triple H & Stephanie, how they actually had to fight for their relationship including the risk he took to date her, and actual footage from their wedding.

D-Generation X's return is heavy discussed next in how they pulled it off knowing they weren't the same people they were a decade earlier, if it was watered down, and how they felt the critics missed the point of the comedy they were doing before going into his second quad injury followed by talking about the feud with Randy Orton in detail such as incorporating his real life marriage to Stephanie into the storyline & what went wrong in their WrestleMania 25 match.

Matches Include:
Jean-Paul Levesque vs. Ricky Steamboat - Steamboat took control early with headlock takeovers with Levesque attempting to gain control with punches only for Steamboat to return them along with a catapult in the corner only for Levesque to use fist again to stop Steamboat's momentum briefly only for Steamboat to deliver his classic armdrag but Levesque was able to take advantage of a mistiming by Steamboat to heavily work over his arm to the point where it hurt Steamboat when he threw his own clothesline as Levesque was using the ropes & ring post along with moves like the fujiara armbar & hammerlock slams. This was very early in Triple H's career but left an impression with how his storytelling of how he was able to work over a body part.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Sept. '94

vs. Dude Love - Dude started out in control by constantly knocking Triple H down with a back body drop & clotheslines while working him over with armbars & wrenches along with a double axe handle as Triple H was in the tree of woe forcing Chyna to get physical on the outside while taking shots whenever she could allowing Triple H to take advantage with a snapmare on the ropes & knee drop to the fact before Dude was able to regain control driving Triple H's face into all three turnbuckles in one corner along with sweet shin music & double arm DDT causing Chyna to once again be what Jim Ross described on commentary as ""the difference maker."" This was a lost match in Triple H's feud against Mick Foley as this wasn't as physical or hardcore as the other matches they've had against each other.
One Night Only '97

Iron Man Match vs. WWE Champion The Rock - This was the second Iron Man match in WWE history with Shawn Michaels himself being assigned as the special guest referee. HHH kept going to the outside early on whenever Rock began to gain momentum & took control working over the arm before they brawled on the floor with Rock focusing on the legs using the ringpost & steel steps & figure four back in the ring. They went back & forth with Triple H using Rock's own momentum against him to send him over the top rope hitting the announce table while Rock continued to work over the knees sent HHH into the steps knees first & applied the leg gravevine while kept attacking the knees whenever Triple H started to gain some momentum as they fought to the stage area & isleway making their way back to ringside with HHH taking some hard hits on the floor while Rock was on the receiving end of not only a piledriver in the ring with both men eventually having their heads bounced off the different tables at ringside. Shawn made his presence known from time to time by forcing Triple H to break his moves on occasions leading to a confrontation between the two while Triple H resorted to sacrificing a fall in order to bust Rock open only for Rock to come back with a whip into the corner with such impact that HHH ended landing on a cameraman before Rock not only sent him into the ring post but a Rock Bottom on the announce table that didn't give causing Triple H to be busted open as well as the action got even more intense with not only Triple H's allies in DX & the McMahon's making their presence known but also the return of a man with a brand new look who had his own issues with the McMahons causing Shawn to make a very controversial call. I really enjoyed this Iron Man match as the story of each man trying to one up each other & keep the advantage plays out well here such as sacrificing one fall just to gain two while they had a lot of action both in the ring & outside the ring while showcasing different wrestling styles from in-ring action to brawling as I consider this a quality match in both men's careers.
Judgment Day '00

No Disqualification Match vs. Kurt Angle - Mick Foley was the special guest referee for this match with Triple H coming in with taped ribs based off Angle's attack on the previous SmackDown as Angle targeting them right away with strikes & kicks with Triple H fighting back with knockdown punches & taking advantage of the ""No DQ"" rule bouncing Angle's head off the steps & announce table before Angle retaliated sending HHH into the barricade ribs first & got more aggressive with his attack on the ribs such a suplex directly on the ribs & attacking them whenever Triple H started to build momentum to the point where it effected Triple H when he attempted his own offense. Angle whipped HHH so hard into the turnbuckle that it sent him over the top rope to the floor while HHH was later able to counter an irish whip on the outside sending Angle into the steel steps & used the chair on Angle's back while Angle suplexed HHH off one announce table onto another & continued to attack the injured ribs with strong whips & shoulderblocks into the corner along with stretches & suplexes to the point where Triple H was bleeding from the mouth & eye. This was a very physical match as both men took advantage of the ""No DQ"" rule to really make this come off as the grudge match it was intended to be to the point where it all came down to what they were fighting about in the first place, Stephanie.
Unforgiven '00

Intercontinental Championship Match w/WWE Champion Steve Austin vs. Tag Team Champions Undertaker & Kane - For the first time in WWE history, the original top four championships (World, I.C., Tag Team) were all on the line in one match with Jim Ross also making the side note that Triple H would become the second ""Grand Slam"" champion in WWE history if his team were to win tonight. Kane came into the match with arm heavily bandaged from previous attacks as Austin & HHH kept stalling on the outside causing Taker & Kane to take the fight to them on the stage & ringside before bring it back into the ring where they dominated in the early minutes include Taker delivering Old School onto both men. Austin & HHH regained the advantage by double teaming & keeping Taker while taking advantage of the situation that he didn't want to tag Kane in due to his bad arm before Kane eventually tagged himself in causing what Taker feared to happen in that they targeted his arm with wrestling such as an armbar takedown & stretch while working behind the referee's back & taunting Taker causing a distraction to also use weapons from a chair to the steel steps. This was a fun tag match with all the star power & personalities involved along with the storytelling of the match revolving around Kane's arm.
Backlash '01

World Championship Match vs. Rob Van Dam - Triple H started out very aggressive with strikes & chops in the corner with RVD coming back using his ""educated feet"" with various kicks along with a moonsault to the outside & baseball slides both in & out of the ring resulting in Flair getting involved whenever possible including ramming RVD's leg into the post allowing Triple H to heavily target it with a chop block & submissions like the indian death lock & figure four but RVD was able to comeback still using his legs for various kicks & athleticism such as the springboard crossbody & split leg moonsault only for things to start getting out of control with the presence of not just Flair but Randy Orton as well resulting in Eric Bischoff making a decision that allowed the action to continue on the floor & to the stage area with chairs & the World Title being legal to use in the match. This was a competitive match between both men.
""RAW"" June '03

World Championship/Last Man Standing Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Both men started off trading fist against each other before it settling down into wrestling holds with Triple H gaining the early advantage working over Shawn's previously injured back with hard whips in the corner & backbreaker causing Shawn to execute the same strategy in working over Triple H's previously injured leg with a legwhip & low dropkick followed by a figure four. Shawn started going more high risk with moves like a double axe handle with some not paying off sending him to the outside & through a table which not only caused him to heavily bleed but allowed Triple H to punish his back with chairshots & moves like a spinebuster while yelling ""STAY DOWN SHAWN!"" only for Shawn to keep asking for more before finally able to come back using the chair & ring post to his own advantage busting open Triple H as both men continued to trade momentum from countering each other's moves either using the momentum against the other or dirty tactics like a low blow to hitting their signature moves. This match ended in a way that previous Last Man Standing matches have which had a negative response from people but if you can get back the last 10 seconds & focus on everything from start to finish then you see they delievered a very physical match.
Royal Rumble '04

vs. Ric Flair - This was the opening round of a tournament to determine who would face John Cena for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 22 with Flair starting out in control with punches & chops to the head before Triple H took control focusing on Flair's back with his spinebuster & delayed vertical suplex along with the head with punches & kneedrops to the point where Flair was bleeding only for Flair to come back with working over his leg with a chop block & figure four along with actually hitting the top rope forearm along with resorting to his ""dirtiest player in the game"" tactics to not only Triple H but the referee as well. This wasn't the quality of their series of matches months earlier but was a solid match overall.
""RAW"" Feb. '06

vs. King Booker - This was Triple H's return match from his quad injury earlier in the year returning to his ""King Of Kings"" persona with him starting out with various knockdown punches & clotheslines over the top rope while easily countering Booker T's offense before Sharmell kept getting involved allowing Booker to focus on Triple H's leg & eventually hitting the Book End but Triple H kept coming back using both the ring steps & announce table on the outside while using the spinebuster & taking advantage of Booker missing a high risk maneuver. Booker T would later openly say in interviews that his heart wasn't into this match as the reality of this match was that Booker was just put here as a body for Triple H to make a dominate return performance.
SummerSlam '07

WWE Championship/Last Man Standing Match vs. Randy Orton - Before I get started, I have to explain (as Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler did before the match) how this match happened as this was not only one of most unique setups in not just WWE but wrestling history for not only a championship match but & wrestling event alone. John Cena was scheduled to defend the WWE Championship against Randy Orton in this match but was injured earlier in the week on RAW so Mr. McMahon awarded the championship to Randy Orton at the beginning of the show before he was challenged & defeated by Triple H minutes later in the opening match but Triple H was already scheduled to face Umaga during that PPV & defended the championship against him later in the night only for Mr. McMahon to inform Triple H afterwords that they advertised a Last Man Standing Match for the WWE Championship & were going to deliver it leading to this main event with it being Orton's second match of the night & Triple H's third. Orton attacked the ribs that were already hurt in his match against Umaga using whatever he could from the steel ramp to barricade to ringside steps while punishing it with moves such as the inverted backbreaker & body scissors before Triple H was able to get some offense in taking advantage of his surrounding with the ECW announce table & steel steps only for Orton to regain control & be relentless with his attack executing an RKO & DDT onto a chair busting open Triple H in the process as the match eventually got taken back to the floor with both men targeting each others heads using whatever they could get their hands on such as the announce table, ring post, chair & steel steps. Little known fact is that while Orton & Triple H have had countless matches against each other for years in WWE, this was actually the first of three ""Last Man Standing"" matches they would have against each other (One Night Stand '08 & ""RAW"" in June '09) with this one I believe being the best one as with Orton being completely ruthless while Triple H wasn't 100% but was going to keep fighting until he had absolutely nothing left.
No Mercy '07

vs. Jeff Hardy - After going through task after task for weeks on end, this was Jeff Hardy's opportunity to be put into the WWE Championship match at Survivor Series if he defeats the current champion in Triple H. Hardy came out the gate with aggressive punches & kicks along with his daredevil offense such as the head scissors takeover & clothesline off the apron before he crashed & burned allowing Triple H to take advantage working over Hardy's back with a hard whip into the corner, back breaker, spinebuster, and abdominal stretch only for Hardy to to come back once again taking high risk like his back to back Whisper In The Wind & various legdrops while taking advantage of his surroundings using the announce table on the outside before Vladimir Kozlov made an appearance that distracted both men at one point. This wasn't the the high intense quality match that we got on the previous two PPV's (Cyber Sunday & Taboo Tuesday) but it was still television quality.
""SmackDown"" Nov. '08

vs. Chris Jericho - This was a preview for the upcoming T.L.C. PPV as both of their partners in Shawn Michaels & eventually Big Show would be on commentary throughout the match. Triple H started out in control early before a distraction allowed Jericho to take the momentum springboard dropkicking Triple H off the apron to the floor & eventually tossing Triple H into the outside ring steps as both men went back & forth in the ring blocking one hold only for theirs to be countered in return from the Lionsault & Walls Of Jericho to the Pedigree & DDT with the tag partners eventually delivering knockout blows in favor of their partners. With the exception of their WrestleMania X8 match which I hated (another story for another time), I never recall Triple H & Chris Jericho having a bad match against each other & this was no exception as it was competitive with both men trading momentum non-stop from start to finish.
""RAW"" Nov. '09

(Blu-Ray) No Holds Barred Match vs. Brock Lesnar - With Triple H's career on the line, Shawn Michaels returned to be in Triple H's corner while Paul Heyman was in Brock's while Triple H's entrance didn't go as well as expected resulting in him receiving second degree burns. Both men started out very aggressively to the point where they were on the floor in less than a minute with Brock being sent into the barricade & announce table before Brock retaliated sending Triple H into the post & over the barricade as they continued to take turns just beating the hell out of each other on the floor from the head bouncing off the steel steps to being slammed through the spanish table. Brock took control constantly beating on Triple H with repeated throws before Brock changed his focus towards Shawn allowing Triple H to regain the advantage with a spinebuster & bringing a chair into the match at one point as both men began going back & forth delivering a pedigree & F5 followed by more use of the steel chair & ringside steps & ring post as they targeted each others arm using the Kamora Lock & both men finding ways to break the hold. This surpassed their SummerSlam match months earlier as this did come off as a personal fight with both men not only delivering a beating to each other while telling a story but each of the managers at ringside playing a role into the match as well.
WrestleMania XXIX

In the end, I really liked the presentation & the bonus stories told on the DVD (I chuckled at the Newlywed Game thing they did) while the treats of actually hearing from Undertaker was that we didn't get matches that have previous released on any set outside of the PPV/Anthology DVD sets so I would highly recommend.",1380499200,4,22403,4.5760896637608965
