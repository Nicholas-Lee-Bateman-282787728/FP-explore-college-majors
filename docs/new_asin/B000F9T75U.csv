8119369,4,B000F9T75U,"I actually enjoyed his review almost as much as this video. What's here ranges from almost good to pretty great, but the critics are correct -- the psychedelic effects have not aged well and in some cases really obscure the performances. Johnny Winter and Free, in particular, were virtually ruined by the cheesy and irritating backdrops. At the same time, there were some real revelations here. Who knew Procol Harum's drummer was such a Keith Moon style rocker? The singer of Humble Pie just shreds this very odd cover of ""For Your Love."" In Santana's Black Magic Woman, there are terrific shots of a shocking cherubic Neal Schon trying to look cool and unafraid. I think the standout video is The James Gang killing it on ""Walk Away."" I always saw Joe Walsh as kind of the jester of the Eagles -- amazing guitar player, obviously, but a guy with a lighter personality. Here he just whales on it, and it opened my eyes to the greatness of a song I've heard a hundred times and always liked, but now see in a new way.",1390608000,,1018,4.508108108108108

8119372,5,B000F9T75U,"I ""discovered"" Joe Walsh through this dvd.  Of course I'd heard him a million times growing up on FM radio, but seeing this live set of WALK AWAY blew my mind.  I ended up buying a lot of his albums after that.  That guy rocked, and to think I'd previously only associated him with the Eagles.

Deep Purple is always cool.  My favorite video of theirs would have to be LIVE IN CONCERT 72, 73 - a Copenhagen show - vintage Purple with all their powers in full flower - the song on BEAT club is ok and in that era, doesn't reach what I've seen them do, but certainly is worth a look.

The Johny Winter is alright; the Old Grey Whistle Test performance ""Frankenstein"" ('73) is more exciting but this isn't bad by any means.

Nazareth's MORNING DEW is incredible.  They were a different group at that time.  I knew them from Hair of the Dog way back when, but this Nazareth while hard rock is more blues based and soulful than what I'd remembered them as in Hair of the Dog.  This is a fantastic cut and one of the gems of this set in my opinion.  Picking up their first album on which this song is supposedly, is next on my list.

Humble Pie's always a winner, though I've liked them better in other songs than in this cut of For Your Love.  Still, u get to see a young Peter Frampton at work with the group. The over-priced 'Life and Times of Steve Marriott' has some excellent Humble Pie stuff with Frampton as well.

This DVD is a great watch, reasonably priced and well worth buying.",1222387200,3,1484,4.234875444839858

8119374,4,B000F9T75U,"Let me start off by saying that the performances on this DVD are outstanding from the popular West German television show that aired from September 1965 through December 1972. ""Psychedelia"" in TV video editing carried over from the late 60's and was still ""in"" at the time of these performances (1970-1972). Unfortunately now, if you want to enjoy ""viewing"" the artists perform you may be a bit disappointed with some of these. The background effects tend to overpower the artist's performance at times (unlike the tracks on Vol. 2 which have minimal Psychedelic images added and they are only a few). On the positive side, the extended songs on this color show are great and performed not long after being released. The following is a brief critique of each track (star ratings are based on the ability to view the artist through the special effects):

** Deep Purple - This is ""Mk2"" Purple at their peak. Gillan, Blackmore and company adlib their way through a classic number from ""Machine Head"".
4.5 Stars
** The James Gang - Joe Walsh and gang do one of their greatest songs. A little too much effect toward the end but still great.
4 Stars
** Johnny Winter - Great to see a rare TV performance of the great Texas bluesman. Rick Derringer is not in this line-up.
4 Stars
** Santana - The effects hurt a great song and performance.
3 Stars
** Procol Harum - Great song, great performance and ""Robin Trower"" before he left the group.
4.5 Stars
** Nazareth - Dan McCafferty & group perform a classic song from their 1971 debut album ""Nazareth"".
4.5 stars
** Free - Biggest disappointment. The effects completely take over the video. You get a few small glimpses of Paul Rodgers face and some quick edits of the other band members throughout one of the greatest rock songs of all-time.
3 Stars
** Humble Pie - The only track on this disc that has no added effects and you get to see each member perform. Steve Marriott, ""Peter Frampton"" (before he left to go solo) and company play a great acoustic number. Very reminiscent to an ""unplugged"" session.
4.5 Stars

Sound quality on all: 3.5 Stars
(not bad for an early 70's TV show)
No Bonus features.

Some tracks are slightly ""chopped off"" either in the beginning or the end but overall it's minimal. Although only 8 tracks, approximately 43 minutes in length but well-priced ($8.99 at the time of this review) you won't go wrong purchasing this classic early 70's rock disc.",1148428800,23,2424,4.658878504672897
