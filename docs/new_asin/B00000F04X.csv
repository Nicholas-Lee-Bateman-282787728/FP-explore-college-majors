dam'n near distinct I've been looking for it on DVD since and can't find
it for nothing. To amazon you should look into getting this product on DVD with vote recommendation like you did the Strictly Business movie or better yet like the underground Doug E. Fresh movie Let's Get Bizzee it
would be highly appreciated and ordered on impact as well.

  Thanx a lot

7906142,5,B00000F04X,"I just purchased this in DVD format and I haven't laughed so hard in years. I actually had stomach pains from laughing. as previous reviewers cautioned this brand of humor isn't for everyone. I was not upset over any of the disabled comments (I haveMS). I loved the fact that he was in my hometown of Chicago, where all were in tears from this very funny and under rated comedian",1174003200,,379,4.428571428571429
7906143,1,B00000F04X,"Like the other reviewer I ordered this tape with eager
anticipation. My family and I loved Arnez J from seeing
him perform on BET. I was utterly amazed at the constant
profanity that I did not make it past the first 3 to 4
minutes. I know that comics have a dark side but I would have
appreciated some sort of content advisory on the label so
I would not have wasted my time ordering.
I also wished that the other review I read was wriiten at the time. Also the video quality was poor.",1001376000,,485,4.11578947368421
7906144,1,B00000F04X,"I saw Arnez J. perform on the BET network a couple years ago and have been looking for a video of his work ever since. When I saw this video offered here, I ordered it with eager anticipation of laughing until my my stomach muscles burned. Unfortunately, the only thing that got burned was a hole in my wallet. The Arnez J. I saw on BET and the Arnez J. in this video are two completely different performers. He spent entirely too much time poorly delivering cliche' material that's been performed far better by various other artists. In addition, he infused very little of his trademark body convulsing into the act. From the poor performance to the home video quality of the tape, Arnez J.'s ""I Got Problems in Chicago"" has even more problems delivering laughs. It was a complete and utter disappointment as well as a waste of money.",1000512000,,835,4.573333333333333
