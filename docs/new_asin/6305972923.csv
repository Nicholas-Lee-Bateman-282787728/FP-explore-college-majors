1101943,4,6305972923,"Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbe) is a bisexual writer with who is obsesssed with religious imagery, who arrives in Amsterdam to give literary lectures.
There he meets a beautiful female psychiatrist named Christine (Renee Soutendijk)and he spends the night with her, because despite his sexual preference he finds her figure to be like a boy's (I didn't think so). But it soon becomes apparent to Reve that he should have stuck with men so he predictably dumps her. But what Gerard doesn't know is that Christine may or may not be a serial killer who has murdered her three previous husbands and that he or his gay lover may become the fourth man of the title. Things get worse when he has hallucinations (or are they premonitions?) in which he is castrated with a pair of scissors. Funny seeing as Christine is also a hairdresser. Later in the movie Gerard has more hallucinations, which seem real even to the viewer. Are we going mad with him?
I've seen all Paul Verhoeven's movies from FLESH + BLOOD onward, so this is quite different from his later stuff. THE 4TH MAN is a successful take on film noir, but it's pace dwindles at times. However, I still highly recommend this movie. There is also a notable secne involving an eyeball squelching through a keyhole early in the movie, which makes sense later on. Worth a look.",1034380800,2,1322,4.6781115879828326
1101944,5,6305972923,"I first saw this film at a wonderful old art house theater which no longer exists.  It was run by a film professor and its loyal audience saw just about everything that played the art house circuit.  At the end of this film, the audience burst into applause, which I'd never seen it do before and never saw it do again.  Hubby and I were madly clapping along with them because we all knew we'd just seen bravura, breath taking film making. Rene Soutendijk plays a blonde hairdresser (DVD cover) who meets gay writer Jeroen Krabb and lures him into her black widow like web. Krabb becomes haunted by visions of his own death and Soutendijk has perhaps already had that terminal effect on three prior husbands.  If you are thinking that maybe this is like the American ""Black Widow,"" it is not except in the essence of idea.

This film takes that basic idea and makes it high art, exploring the dream, surreal world adjacent to the real world. Jan DeBont's cinematography is a surreal painter's delight come to life. Director Paul Verhoeven showed the wit, style, and right-brained art making that he gave up when he came to the USA to make American films, such as ""Basic Instinct.""  The two films are similar in that both have a female messing with the mind of a male in murderous connotations but ""Basic Instinct"" has all of the flash and style of ""Fourth Man"" but none of its art. This film also is more sexually daring than ""Basic Instinct"" with its exploring both gay and straight sexuality. Krabb lusts after Soutendijk's boyfriend, who is much younger than he.  It also contains full-frontal nudity of both men plus the woman. I really wish Verhoeven  had remained a Dutch filmmaker, doing more of this kind of work, rather than ""going Hollywood"" with his films upon coming here to the USA.

1101945,4,6305972923,"The director's commentary on the DVD is very informative.  In fact, though I'd had the video for many years there were aspects that - even after repeated viewings of the film - I'd never realized before.  The commentary is also interesting because it seems - like the original FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN films - this film is to be taken not literally, but with a high dosage of humor.  Knowing that makes the film even more enjoyable; almost a guilty pleasure, with its moments of high camp and yet serious tone and definite sophistication.  It's intriguing the title character is based upon the actual writer of the novel - Gerard Reve - and his own stories, and that actually puts me off.  I wonder about someone who places himself as the lead character in a story and is even protrayed by an actor in the film.  The performances are uniformly good, with two leads and one supporting lead.  All of the actors are - or became - well known in European films.  Personally I'm not a fan of Paul Verhoeven's BASIC INSTINCT - in fact, I don't think I've ever been able to sit through all of it.  I find this film to be particularly good at working on various levels, however it could be typed as misogynistic in its attitude towards its lone female lead, and if you're put off by male-male kissing (the lead male character lusts after a younger man, the boyfriend of the lead female character) or full-frontal nudity (both males and the female) then this is not the film for you.  However, the overall film is very funny; very stylish; and too high class to be termed campy.",989193600,5,1582,4.538732394366197

1101987,4,6305972923,"Prospective buyers should be aware that there are at least three different VHS releases of this title.  This Amazon entry describes  the VHS version as Dutch with English subtitles, released by Xenon Entertainment in 1992.  The cover art as shown on Amazon has a band across the top that says 'Cinematique'.  There is also a later letterboxed Dutch version, released by Starz/Anchor Bay in 2001, with a separate Amazon listing [here]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fourth-Man-VHS/dp/6305972923/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fourth Man [VHS</a>]  This listing has lots of good user reviews for content.

I ordered a used copy of this Xenon release through Amazon, but the tape I received was actually from a different, earlier dubbed release by Media Home Entertainment, 1984 (immediately after the original Dutch theatrical release in 1983).  It says ""English language version"" on the back.  The cover photo is the same, but the 'Cinemathique' band is missing from the top, and the logo 'Media' in big puffy Peter Max style letters is added at the bottom, under the title.  There is a separate Amazon listing [here]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-4th-Man/dp/B0007LXT5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 4th Man</a>&nbsp;for this dubbed version.

At first I was just going to return it, since it is not what I ordered, but I thought I would have a look at it first.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Usually I hate dubbed versions of anything, but here the quality of the dubbing is very good, probably the best I have ever heard.  It was evidently done in a British studio, since all the dubbed voices have British accents of various kinds.  This helps to preserve the foreign-language character of the film.  Also they do an excellent job of matching the various different types of British accent to the different social classes of the various characters.  Most importantly, a lot of care and rehearsal seems to have gone into the line readings, both for dramatic tone and for lip synchronization.  Through almost all of the film I was able to watch it without being unpleasantly aware of the dubbing at all.  Only during one scene of a loud argument with a lot of rapid shouted cross talk did the dubbing seem a little unconvincing.

On the other hand the color seemed a little washed out to me, which may be a sign of a poor video transfer, since Verhoeven is known for a rich color palette.  I don't have either of the Dutch VHS releases or the DVD to compare this to.

In the end I decided to keep this version.  Verhoeven in my view is sort of high-class schlock more than great art anyway, and this well-dubbed version seems to me about right for this movie, which you might want to watch in the background while cooking dinner, without having to read subtitles.  Whereas someone who wants to study it carefully will presumably want the more expensive DVD for the director's commentary anyway.  But someone like me who just wants a cheaper VHS copy to watch for entertainment should check first with the seller to find out which version they are getting.",1414972800,2,3144,5.143700787401575

1101995,4,6305972923,"This film has great atmosphere, with an alcoholic writer who may be going insane.  He is full of violent fantasies, his life spinning out of control, and he goes about his career in a fog.  Called to give a reading in a small village, he sees a boorish young man that he would like to seduce.  The village culture spot seems to be run by a hairdresser business woman with an interest in literature.  She invites the writer to stay at her place, and by a strange connection, she invites the young man over that he wanted to seduce.  In his paranoid manner, the writer begins to think that something strange is happening, that the woman is somehow other than human.  He notices, for example, that she lacks sensation in parts of her back, like witches.  Even more ominous, he begins to see that she is associated with the violent deaths of no less than 3 husbands.  It remains uncertain if he is victim of an alcoholic psychosis, apparently a source for his imaginative powers, the basis of his extraordinary talent.  Finally, as he is seducing the young man in a graveyard, he realizes they are in the mausoleum that contains the ashes of all 3 husbands.  This drives him over the edge in spite of what happens next, and the village people banish him to a hospital for the insane.

While I tried to hide the many off-beat surprises in the film, the plot matters less than the nightmarish atmosphere of the film.  This is highly successful and an interesting precursor to the director's later work.  Recommended warmly.  Very solid entertainment.",1302134400,,1544,4.6286764705882355
1101996,5,6305972923,paul verhoeven made his masterpiece before he took off to america to make basic instinct - the fourth man tells the tale of a man caught in a spider web - it is not a mysognyst film as one reviewer stated but more of an allegory about a man and how he himself becomes trapped.. He is an alcoholic who is as easily seduced by the young male lover as he is by the woman who is in between the two men.. this spider (god perhaps) has caught these men in a metaphoric gesture - and they are doomed to meet their fate - in a way they represent the artist who can't escape his own undertaking.. this film plays like one of the great novels - you are just sucked in and are a victim to its bite.,1169942400,,687,3.949640287769784
1102056,3,6305972923,"For me this film held the most interest in the respect that it was early Paul Verhoeven, something I had never seen before. This was a quality experience that gave insight into his later work and created more curiosity for me about his earlier work. It does have a little trouble taking flight at the beginning, but once it does it provides the viewers with a worthwhile script and an intriguing ending. The story follows Gerard as he travels by train to give a literary speech. Once in the new town he hits it off with a good looking blond named Christine who has femme fatale written all over her. If only our hero had had the opportunity to see ""Basic Instinct"" before this journey of his perhaps he would have used more common sense. This controversial author with a focus on death gives in to her sexual demands even though he is quite clearly a homosexual. He decides to stay in her house for a few more days as a sort of live in sex toy. This leads to something of a problem as his snooping ways get the best of him and he soon discovers that Christine has been married three previous times. Plus, all of her exes have died and she has some very suspicious videos of them immediately before their deaths. Paranoia grows on top of paranoia in his mind after he concludes (rightfully) that all of her previous beaus have passed. I should point out that this whole Sherlock Holmes thing he is doing is not just out of innocent curiosity. No, you see, it is all part of a master plan to get close to Christine's other lover who Gerard has a thing for. . .real bad.

The thing that pushed this film over the edge from an OK one to a good one is the ending. It is left up to you to decide the truth about the situation. This is a tricky device to use as nobody really wants to spend two hours just to be left in the dark. The title refers to Gerard's theory that Christine plans on killing four men, and by the end of the film a fourth man connected to her has died. But is he truly the 4th Man? Or is it all part of a terrible run of luck for her? What about the film reels he finds? And what about the final death which certainly looks orchestrated by nobody other than fate. There are other questions to be found here as well. The whole film has a nice surreal quality to it. The dream sequences are disturbing and morbid. Many of them foretell the future, but we of course don't know it at the time. I also liked the way it swam in its own delicious sleaze. For instance, near the end Gerard and his object of lust find themselves in a tomb on the verge of sex. But it's not just any tomb, it is the tomb of Christine's three dead husbands. Oh please. Like they would really be buried together and like these two guys would just accidentally stumble in there for some recreational activities. I also liked the way they played with out perceptions of reality. We all see what we want to see. But Gerard is a drunk, Catholic writer, so he really sees what he wants to see. So I ask you, what did he see? Was he a crazed madman with no feel for truth or a perceptive onlooker who spoke the truth when nobody else dared to? ***1/4",1164412800,2,3131,4.209650582362729
1102057,5,6305972923,"Verhoeven's last Dutch movie was made out of spite. Increasingly lambasted for his films in his native Holland for being too perverted and desperate to make the move to Hollywood, this was the movie he made to show off potential executives in the USA. There were movie offers that he was interested in, in America, but due to one reason or another, he ended up frustrated with the whole process of waiting.

Often cited as a prototype of Basic Instinct, this can easily work on its own levels. Sure there are similarities ie is there murder involved? What is the lead character hiding? Bisexuality etc. but it's a different movie with a different feel to it.

The story starts out that Gerard Reve is a bisexual author who believes his stories "" lie the truth."" It is an interesting statement at a lecture he gives but what I found more interesting was that after stating he was a Catholic and goes on to say that "" science is Catholic."" Given that anyone I know who is deeply religious is against the very notion of science because "" they are trying to play God."" I'm not one bit religious but it provides a thought provoking question in "" Is science an extension of Christianity."" Believe it or not I spent half the night thinking over that one over since it had stuck in my head.

The great thing about Verhoeven's pre-Hollywood movies is their ability to insert glorious visual treats. The visions that Gerard gets at times are distinctly creepy. While on a train he notices a picture of a hotel and is transported there while daydreaming. He goes to the door and is about to open the door when he sees an eye pop out of the door and ooze it's way down leaving a bloody smear across the door. Some may see shades of Bunuel and Dali in that shot alone.

Ingmar Bergman, a director Paul Verhoeven frequently cites as an influence, also shows. The opening image of a spider preying on a fly as it's victim is also startling in it's detail. How it creeps around and wraps the fly around in it's web so it can't move. As I say it's fascinating in it's detail.

Gerard falls for Christine, a hairdresser left a fortune from her dead husband. But is she hiding a secret from Gerard. The plot slowly unravels as does Gerard's sanity while his mind is giving him clues as to what might be the truth ( or a lie of the truth as it were ). Whether Christine is what Gerard thinks she is is up to you.

If I were to compare this to Basic Instinct ( which is inevitable really ), I would have to say that this lays more intrigue on the viewer and in a certain way is like the spider laying a web whereas Basic Instinct is a lot more blunt and obvious. Apart from some homoeroticism which borders on blasphemy if you are particularly religious in The Fourth Man, Basic Instinct has lesbianism which is a lot more palatable for Americans. There are calls of misogyny and it is true there are instances in The Fourth Man where that occurs but it is not as crude as Basic Instinct. In contrast to Basic Instinct, yes there are similarities but this feels like a completely different movie and has a different feel to it as well. While The Fourth Man is an atmospheric chiller that grips the viewer, Basic Instinct, despite the plot that revolves around it, feels a bit like a soft porn parody. However that is only my view of things. All in all this movie should be seen by those who like a sense of adventure in their movies.",1135468800,5,3412,4.3823064770932065
1102058,5,6305972923,"The director, Paul Verhoeven, creates a profoundly Christian movie and presents it to a bored post-Christian world disguised as a cheap sex comedy with special effects.

Show me a man more more sunk in degradation than our eminent Dutch writer and drunk and lecher and thief, masterfully played by the actor Jeroen Krabbe. Who would die to redeem this failure of a human being? Yet someone does die an ugly vicious death.

1102059,4,6305972923,"The premise of this movie is that there are good and there are bad women.  A banality, sure, but in this movie there are Banshee screams of misogyny that only a non-woman lover could muster.

The main character, a writer and a self-accepting bi-sexual, has a relationship with a boyish blonde woman, only to become attracted to her other boyfriend.  The woman is a femme fatal in the literal sense of the word.  She is offset by another, Madonna-like woman, who floats in and out of scenes.

This is the ultimate male fantasy: having a sensual woman lust after him and another motherly one protecting him.  Verhoeven has hit a potentially rich vein.

Unfortunately, he was still European when he made this movie so frontal (male) nudity is accepted as natural and the film  could never see the light of day in the US without an ""X"" rating. Later Verhoeven would push the envelope in Hollywood with Sharon Stone's crotch shot in Basic Instinct.

This is an atmospheric movie and works best the first time, when all the puzzle pieces are still mixed up for the viewer.  On second viewing, I knew where each piece went so it was more of a recall exercise.

In any case I'd say that this movie does capture a view of women that many men hold at one time or other in their lives.",1125446400,2,1274,4.495652173913044

As Gerard remains in Vlissingen the secular warning sings continue to haunt him.  The question is why are these frightful visions and signs returning to him.

1102062,1,6305972923,"when i first saw this film i was very confused about what 'the Fourth Man', the film, was supposed to be doing. Now after reasearching the film, mostly through reviews, i guess it was supposed to be a black comedy. I didn't get that at all...i love black comedies....favorite genre. This wasn't funny.... and by a near universal standard. Wasn't all that 'Black' either. The alleged 'Blaspemous' element came off as very corny.....the subject matter may have been blaspemous 200 years ago. It's mostly geared towards christianity. It's a sort of 'blasphemy' that operates from the presupposition that the fundamental principles of christianity are serious....so maybe if you are really into jesus this might be funny. It's on say the same level as Sinead O' Conner tearing up a photo of the pope as a statement...very ""controversial""!! so i guess if you are a big fan of black comedies stay away from this as the characters and story will just come off as very annoying. though if you have decidedly bourgeois sensibilities and take christianaity semi seriously this might be interesting. I would highly reccomend seeing any Luis Bunuel films first....he was the black comedy master.

1102064,5,6305972923,"Homoeroticism, religious themes and symbolism, supernatural overtones and dark mystery pulsate through this excellent thriller from Dutch director Paul Verhoeven. Bisexual alcoholic novelist Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbe') attends a speaking engagement and meets a beautiful woman, Christine (Renee Soutendijk) who is filming him. She invites him home with her, they have sex and he stays on to work on his next novel. She says she is a widow and gives him clothes and a haircut (her home is also her salon, Sphinx---she's a hair stylist) and some pampering. But Gerard can't forget a sexy young man he saw at the train station. He discovers that Christine knows the guy and is having an affair with him as well. Gerard is also having disturbing psychic visions of death that seem to be omens for him. When Christine brings the young man home to meet Gerard (Christine and Gerard have worked out an odd arrangement) things start happening. Gerard discovers Christine has had THREE husbands who all died in ""accidents"". His visions come full circle and another grisly ""accident"" sends him over the edge. References to Samson and Delilah, spiders who devour their mates, blood---everything but the kitchen sink is thrown in to keep you guessing about Christine. Even the name of her salon---Sphinx (which spells ""spider"" in Dutch when the neon lights blink off)---casts occult laced mystery on her. Soutendijk is mesmerizing as Christine, an icy blonde beauty with secrets. Krabbe' is very good as Gerard who, as the images in the opening credits suggest, may be the fly caught in the Black Widow's web. Fascinating viewing all the way. The DVD from Anchor Bay is superb. Not for every taste, of course, but if you're a Verhoeven fan---this is an adult must see. Based on a novel by...""Gerard Reve""!",1063411200,3,1794,5.003344481605351
1102065,5,6305972923,"Previously dismissed as a soft porn filmmaker in Europe, Verhoeven decided to make a film so overloaded with symbolism and foreshadowing that the gullible critics would call it ""high art"".  And they did.
The plot is simple but fun, including all Verhoeven's specialties - sex, frontal nudity, explicit gore (castration-ouch!), etc.  When the main character (a drunken poor writer) is determined to meet a young man he cruised at a magazine shop, he also discovers the woman who helped organize his book readings is dating the youngster.  He's off and manages to get both in the sack.  One example of symbolic overkill:  The writer discovers three black film canisters in her house revealing the ""accidental"" deaths of her three previous husbands.  Later, after he gets the young man to have sex in a mausoleum, he spots three black urn canisters containing the woman's three prior husband's ashes!  Now come on!  I won't even get into the 'Virgin Mary' sightings!
However, despite the overload on ALL levels, it makes for a great art-house film and one you'll watch over and over.  (If your eyeball doesn't get poked out - movie hint - more symbolism).
This film enabled Verhoeven to proceed to make such classics as ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Showgirls"".  Trivia:  Main actor Jeroen Kraabe was the evil doctor who framed Harrison Ford in ""The Fugitive"".  Best extra is the inclusion of Verhoeven's director's commentary.

Also this is not not rated. It is rated 18 which is the same as rated-R.

But anyway I knew that all since I bought this dvd from Korea and I knew the Korea's notorious censorship and all. I even thanked that they didn't put the mozaic on the thing of the man and woman's very thing while showing them. It was better to cut that shots then showing it with the mask on.

The movie was marvelous just like I saw it a few times long time ago with the VHS tape. I still remember the chill when I saw this movie back then.
 Paul Verhoeven (director)-Jan de Bont (camera) combie was just great and they worked for many films together and they will in the future.
 The close up shots are all just pure art.
 For example the spider eating other bugs in their web and so on. They are just scary to watch. It indicates that the woman who has been married three times before and she made them died will also make the 4th man die too. Just like the spider eats the own parent.
 The director already worked with Jan De bont-the cinematographer back then with the other movie <Turkish Delight>which was a little failure but kind of not so bad movie with a lot of nudity with cliched love story that a woman dies at the end with the disease just like the Hollywood movie LOVE STORY.
 But the camera work was pretty good. They also worked once more before going to Hollywood with the brutal war movie <Flesh+Blood> Then they later worked together in Hollywood with the legendary movie <BASIC INSTINCT> together. Their early works were made in Netherland, in his motherland.

This movie's story has been already revealed I guess.
 The writer who happens to meets this woman who is not only rich but also has the past that is not a good one who takes care of the writer while staying in the place where he has this speech. Because he wanted not to stay at a hotel, she brings him to her enormously big house which her ex husbad left her.
 They had sex just like that. But that was not all. There was another man that she is in a relationship with- a really young man- and the writer saw his picture and he madly fall in love with that man. He pretended that he can read the mind and he said that him and the lady have some relationship problem that he can fix.
 The woman brought him to her home and the writer tries to seduce the guy.
 One rainny day, when they tried to escape from being all wet, they accidentally come to the family grave where three of the woman's hubands are all burried. They were all dead! He didn't knew that till then.
 The writer was freaked out!
 And then while the guy was driving with the writer on the passenger's seat, a bunch of huge iron sticks dashed to the car and ran into the guy's eyes. He died instantly in a most brital, savage, disgusting way.
 I was almost vomit seeing that shot. Yes, this is Paul Verhoven all right.

The writer became insane in the hospital. He might have been the 4th man. The destiny just passed by and took the other man instead!

This movie is a great one right next to his other movie <BASIC INSTICT>.
 And although it has only Korean Version available and even the amazon is selling the Korean version, it is still worth watching.

7898660,1,6305972923,Buyers Beware! This DVD has been heavily edited to omit controversial scenes. I know as I used to have a factory VHS version of this film. It should be a crime to market this DVD without  censored or edited version warning! Don't waste your money on this product. It's an insult to director Paul Verhoevan.,1436486400,10,306,4.5636363636363635
7898661,4,6305972923,"I don't have this version, I have the American release which I bought years ago from Amazon. This is a great little horror/thriller flick. It's very thematic and has some interesting and disturbing scenes. Probably a bit slow for today's modern horror fan, but it's execelent non the less. The plot is your straight up ""black widow"" story but with a touch of the supernatural. The DVD of the American release is a bit grainy and could do with a nice clean up and transfer to Blu, but otherwise totally watchable. The best gore scene is the snip snip scene!",1427760000,,556,4.57

7898663,5,6305972923,"I saw this when it first came out, and I have continued to watch it every few years. Never disappoints. It's full of wonderful imaginative leaps, perverse style, and great humor. I was conscious, on the most recent viewing, that The Fourth Man is actually part of a small film genre. Krabbe's writer is set upon by lunatic circumstances, which include but are not limited to his own delusions. He is childlike, naive but sympathetic, and his victimization is cast in a humorous light. Polanski's The Tenant is a great second example. Very similar in concept to the 4th Man. Both Trelkovsky and Krabbe's writer are delusional, but the world around them both isn't innocent. It's insane, and so the ""real"" world is implicated in the fate that befalls both. You could also put Scorsese's After Hours in the same bucket. That's a less powerful film, mostly because the protagonist is less interesting and less sympathetic--despite the fact that he's sane. A thought-provoking fact. In the first two films, we are drawn to the characters' insanity. It's endearing and humorous. None of these films were (or are) very popular. It takes a certain temperament to enjoy them. But for the right folks, The 4th Man is a treat.",1417046400,,1215,4.846153846153846

7898665,4,6305972923,"Prospective buyers should be aware that there are at least three different VHS releases of this title.  Amazon has separate listings for each, but they don't always all turn up when you do a title search.  The one depicted in this listing is fullscreen, dubbed into English, released by Media Home Entertainment in 1983.  The one listed [here]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4th-Man-VHS/dp/6302405823/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4th Man [VHS</a>] is Dutch with English subtitles, released by Xenon Entertainment in 1992. The cover art as shown on Amazon has a band across the top that says 'Cinematique'.  The Amazon description doesn't say whether it is fullscreen or letterbox.  Finally, the one listed [here]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-4th-Man/dp/6305972915/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 4th Man</a>&nbsp;is Dutch with English subtitles, letterboxed, released by Starz/Anchor Bay 2001.  There are lots of good user reviews for content attached to this listing for the Starz release.  On the other hand the seller prices for the Media and Xenon releases are much cheaper.

I just wanted a cheap copy to watch the movie.  My Amazon search turned up only the Starz and Xenon Dutch versions, and I ordered the cheapest copy of the Xenon version.  At that point I didn't even know that there was also a dubbed version.  However, what I actually received from the dealer turned out to be the dubbed 1983 Media version depicted here.

At first I was just going to return it, since it is not what I ordered, but I thought I would have a look at it first. I was very pleasantly surprised. Usually I hate dubbed versions of anything, but here the quality of the dubbing is very good, probably the best I have ever heard. It was evidently done in a British studio, since all the dubbed voices have British accents of various kinds. This helps to preserve the foreign-language character of the film. Also they do an excellent job of matching the various different types of British accent to the different social classes of the various characters. Most importantly, a lot of care and rehearsal seems to have gone into the line readings, both for dramatic tone and for lip synchronization. Through almost all of the film I was able to watch it without being unpleasantly aware of the dubbing at all. Only during one scene of a loud argument with a lot of rapid shouted cross talk did the dubbing seem a little unconvincing.

On the other hand the color seemed a little washed out to me, which may be a sign of a poor video transfer, since Verhoeven is known for a rich color palette. I don't have either the DVD or the 1992 or 2001 Dutch VHS versions to compare this to.

In the end I decided to keep this version. Verhoeven in my view is sort of high-class schlock more than great art anyway, and this well-dubbed version seems to me about right for this movie, which you might want to watch in the background while cooking dinner, without having to read subtitles. Whereas someone who wants to study it carefully will presumably want the more expensive DVD for the director's commentary anyway. But someone like me who just wants a cheaper VHS copy to watch for entertainment should check first with the seller to find out which of these three VHS versions they are getting.",1414972800,,3349,5.054446460980036
