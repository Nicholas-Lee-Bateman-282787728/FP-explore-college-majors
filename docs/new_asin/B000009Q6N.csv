7905607,5,B000009Q6N,"Junior/Kiddo is Ling/Fox/Seniors ""sister"" only in the sense that the other students of the Wah mountain master are his ""brothers"". She is actually the daughter of the dead master of the school and has a much more compelling failed romance in the first episode of the series. Swordsmen II is more about gender roles with Asia/Dawn being torn between genders and Junior/kiddo trying to figure our how to deal with her adult femininity after growing up as a tomboy. This is one of many good reasons to track down the original Swordsman so that you can figure out just what all is happening in the movie.
The very bad, sometimes mistyped and sometimes missing, subtitles are perhaps preferable to the dubbing, but how much so depends on the viewer's patience.
Both of the first two installments are worth watching, the 3rd installment is more of a spin-off on Brigitte Lin's fame than a continuation of the story of Ling and Kiddo.",1107043200,2,927,4.763975155279503
7905608,5,B000009Q6N,"Jiang Hu (rivers and lakes, which refers to the world in which martial warriors live) is a dream to us Chinese just as the Knights stories to the Europeans, the Samurai stories to the Japanese. From the ancient time to the morden days, this dream has never faded. Numberless fictions and movies have been produced on the depiction of Jiang Hu. But the true sense of Jiang Hu in many Chinese's minds is hard to reach. A lot of movies ended up ridicules. To me, swordsman II is by far one of the few films that are close to the imagination of Jiang Hu. The movie is adapted from the fiction ""Xiao Ao Jiang Hu"" by the most popular Wuxia story writer Jin Yong (Louis Chan). Though the screenplay is way different from the original work, the sense of Jiang Hu is presented poetically.
The movie tells that after being sold out by their master, the hero Linghu Chong, together with his juniors, set to retire from Jiang Hu to lead a peaceful reclusive life. But on the verge of leaving, he met Ren Yingying, the daughter of the former leader Ren Woxing of a secret sect. The sworn brother of Ren Woxing, Dong Fang Bu Bai (the invincible), secretly imprisoned the leader and usurped. Ren Yingying, who has been loving Linghu Chong, tried to find out his father. Ling Huchong, facing the situation, decided to help Ren Yingying first before retiring. The invincible practised a secret form of martial art and transsexed. He (she) fell in love with Linghu Chong accidentally. After Linghu Chong rescured the former leader, the invincible pursued. As Linghu Chong was away, the invincible massacred almost all his juniors. Linghu Chong, with deep sorrow, joined Ren Woxing in attacking the invincible to revenge for his juniors. By the time they came to the invincible, Linghu Chong found out the invincible was the one that he fell into love with. While the invincible found out Linghu Chong came to attack him (her), he (she) fell into deep despair and resentment. In a mixed sentiment towards Linghu Chong, the invincible was defeated before he could rise up against the emperor. When Ren Woxing restored the control of the sect, he started to purge the men he distrusted from the sect. Linghu Chong, informed by Ren Yingying that her father was to kill him too, had to leave. Reng Yingying, because of being loyal to the sect, was unable to follow Linghu Chong. She could only stand on the shore in desolation and watch grievously as the boat was sailing away.
The story tells so vividly about Jiang Hu world, in which men can not behave as they expect to. With spendid cinematography and graceful choreography, this movie is extremely compelling. After watching that, all the dreams about Jiang Hu rise with temptation and sighs.",999993600,3,2724,4.712788259958072
7905609,2,B000009Q6N,"This movie had so much potential, with a great cast and promising story. Problem is the action was shot as if the person holding the camera was drunk. Quick cuts only work as long as the viewer has a frame of reference to know what is going on. This movie has no frame of reference shots. Jet Li and Brigitte Lin are two of the best, but this movie wastes them.",998784000,,361,4.098591549295775
7905610,4,B000009Q6N,"It is not necessary to watch the first ""Swordsman"" to understand this stunning sequel, which is far better than the fisrt ""Swordsman."" Starring kung-fu international star, Jet Li, Bridgette Lin (""Fire Dragon"") and Rosamund Kwan (""Once Upon A Time In China"" series) also light up the screen in this movie that has a very original plot. Costumes, cinematography, choreography of kung-fu sequences, sets, dialogue, and acting made ""Swordsman II"" a highly notable film, however it is not at the top of Jet Li's list. (At the top is ""Tai Chi Master"", ""Fong Sai Yuk I & 2"", and the ""Once Upon In China"" series.)
Jet Li again manages to bring passion to the screen with his impressive acting, and the wirework and kung-fu sequences in this film only manage to heighten his performance. Well done. - Priscilla",993686400,,801,4.854014598540146
7905611,5,B000009Q6N,"This is one of my personal favorite HK movie. I wanted to get the DVD movie, but because of all the bad reviews about how horrible the subtitles is, I got the VHS version. This is HK movie at it's best. Tsui Hark is one of the best producer/director there is in my mind. Ching Siu-Tung is also a great director and action director.  Jet Li was great, but Brigitte Lin steals the show with her mesmerizing stares. I just hope she will come out of retirement and act again.",969667200,,471,4.233333333333333
