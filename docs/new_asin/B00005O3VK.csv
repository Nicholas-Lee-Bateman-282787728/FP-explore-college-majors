7948136,4,B00005O3VK,"I have been a martial artist for 19 years, and this is the kind of knowledge that masters didn't pass on to their students until the students were ready for it after at least a decade.  After watching this video, I watched 'Enter the Dragon' and recognized a couple of these techniques being applied.  Granted, you need a black belt's skills to apply these techniques, but scary/wonderful stuff indeed.  I hope I never have the need to apply the skills I learned from this video.  This video should be rated ""Mature"" because it teaches the ultimate weaknesses of the human body.  And only mature people should know those.",1097193600,,621,4.712962962962963
