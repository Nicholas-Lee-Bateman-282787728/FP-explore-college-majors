Cuticle Detective Inaba follows detective Hiroshi Inaba as he tries to pursue a criminal who happens to be a goat. He eats real money and the police are hoping to capture him once and for all but he is really sneaky.

Hiroshi and his partner Ogi and his assistants get close to finding Don Valentino the goat criminal but due to their numerous silly fumblings along their way they never accomplish their goal. Still it is fun and hilarious to see just how they go about things in solving crimes. It helps that many of the allied criminals alongside Don Valentino are pretty nutty. They are almost as nutty as Hiroshi and his friends.

The theme songs are suited nicely to the anime. The Opening Theme Song sung by Junichi Suwabe (Hiroshi Inaba) sounds in particular really wonderful. As for the Ending theme song it is sung by Toru Ohkawa (Don Valentino) which is incredibly sad yet cute. As for the voice acting all the characters do an amazing job to highlight how funny it can be and their performances make this series just beyond good. Voice actors and actresses that stand out are: Junichi Suwabe, Miyu Irino, Kousuke Toriumi, and Ai Fukada.

I had also seen this series when it first began simulcasting as it aired. Actually decided on buying Cuticle Detective Inaba-The Complete Series since had some majorly extreme laugh out loud moments with this one. Cuticle Detective Inaba also has really good clean animation with cute character designs which only made me want to own it more. The DVDs themselves have really crisp and clear video quality. When first saw it online compared to the quality on the DVDs the DVDs far surpass it. If were to be asked if recommend this series: It would be an instant yes!

Genre: Comedy, Fantasy

Note: No big extras except the clean opening animation and clean ending animation with some Sentai Filmworks trailers. The actual packaging is bare minimum but the series artwork for this series does capture the series. It only contains subtitles.",1399161600,,2144,4.762803234501348

This anime is absolutely hilarious. I had no idea what to expect when I first started watching it. The premise seemed a bit odd, but I decided to try it out. I'm so glad that I did; it has become one of my favorite animes. I have watched some of the episodes many times. They are so off the wall and funny.
I love the characters! They are so random and if I was to describe them you may wonder why I love them so much. They are an odd bunch, but they just work. Even the ""sensible"" character, Kei, is quite something when cats are involved.
To give you a better idea of whether or not you'll enjoy this show, here's a short list of some of the animes I have enjoyed: Special A, Maid Sama, Kamisama Kiss, Acchi Kocchi, Ouran High School Host Club, Fruits Basket, The Wallflower, Toradora, Skip Beat, Kaze no Stigma, Gosick, Psychic Detective Yakumo, and Inu x Boku SS.",1398729600,4,969,4.21505376344086
