1846912,5,B00008G80Z,"This is without a doublt, one of the best made for tv movies ever!  I remember it well from the time is aired primetime to it's late night reruns.  Get the Kleenex and enjoy Jan Michael Vincent in his prime and the lovely Bonnie Bedelia (""Die Hard"" ""Salem's Lot"") in  this wonderful romantic supernatural drama.  It's also good to see faces we  don't see much anymore like Herschel Bernardi and Mariette Hartley.  The  story focuses on Vincent, who while on his way to return a large amount of  money to Bernardi (money that's the only hope to save his restaurant Papa  Bear's) is killed in an auto accident.  Bedelia is the witness.  Her brief  encounter with the dying Michael leads the story to then take a  supernatural twist of fate.  It was wonderful to find this treasure of 70's  television ... The copy I was sent wasn't the  best by any means.  It had occasion tracking problems and dropouts and was  obviously dubbed off in EP giving the movie a washed out, soft look.  There  were also several areas in which the video became too ""hot""  causing the picture to fade in and out.  I was dissapointed to say the  least in the quality of the dub.  However, loving the story so much I was  just glad to have a copy to share with my daughter after so many years!",957139200,17,1267,4.404347826086957
1846913,5,B00008G80Z,I couldn't say anything less than this is my single most favorite movie of all times! I have had a television copy of this picture for over ten years and it never comes on the television anymore. I've been searching for the  video release and I'm so glad to have found it here at Amazon! I recommend  this movie to anyone and everyone! Definately deserving of FIVE stars!!,940723200,5,372,4.455882352941177
1846914,5,B00008G80Z,"I have been trying to find this movie for years.  I am not one to cry at movies, but this one had me.  It is a romantic movie as well as a tear jerker.  I fell in love with Jan Michael Vincent in this one.  He was the  Brad Pitt of the 70's.",926035200,2,241,3.4716981132075473
1846935,4,B00008G80Z,"Movie perfect for romantics or just those in love!  Could of been a little longer and more in depth, but then again a classic seventies style love story.",1357344000,2,153,4.464285714285714
1846936,1,B00008G80Z,Although I gave this item a good feedback - I had not watched the DVD before I did so.  It looked like any other dvd I have seen but the quality is like a bootleg.  The quality of the film on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being best) is a one.  Very disappointed in the quality.  Very dark and blurred.  For the money I paid - I am not happy with the purchase.,1254960000,4,353,3.6533333333333333
1846937,4,B00008G80Z,"Sandcastles -- saw this movie many years ago -- and it stuck with me.  My goodness but Bonnie Bedelia was young!  And Jan-Michael Vincent, perhaps not the greatest actor of his generation, but probably the best looking man born to woman, all-time.  Slight and a bit corny, but touching all the same.  The picture/sound isn't great, but it's perfectly watchable.  Very glad to see this on DVD!  Now if we could just get ""Baby Blue Marine"" and ""Tribes""....",1214784000,2,454,4.756410256410256
1846938,1,B00008G80Z,"I was led to believe I was ordering ""Sandcastles"" with Jan Michael Vincent when actually it is a cheesy flick (I never heard of) with Linda Carter called ""born to be sold"".......NOT a happy camper here",1196985600,,201,4.611111111111111
1846939,5,B00008G80Z,"First released in 1972 as a made for TV movie, I have remembered it all these years later and longed to see it again. I searched and seached for it and finally found it on a DVD including another movie called Born To Be Sold. I had ordered this twice and waited 2 months both times and never received it. I finally got a copy of it and it's still as excellent as I remember it being all those years ago. Just the mood and feel of this movie with it's classical music and the oceam waves as it's background left a lasting impression in my heart. This movie is well worth seeing if you're looking for a good romance with a twist. Get out the tissues because you'll be needing them before the movie ends. It reminds me alot of Ghost and it's very possible that that's where the idea for it came from. What else can I say about this movie ? I love it... always have, always will...and if you're lucky enough to get a copy of it I'm sure you will, too.",1149379200,17,947,4.096774193548387
1846940,5,B00008G80Z,"When I was about 13 I saw this movie on tv. I fell in love with Jan-Michael Vincent. I could never find it on tv ever again. It has haunted my memory ever since and I never forgot the title or the story. It personifies the good in people. It is a truly romantic storyline about love at the wrong time, and trusting people. Even though it involves sadness, it is an uplifting story.
THANK YOU for having it available! The quality of the tape may not be great, but it's not the fault of the supplier.",1053734400,2,498,4.144329896907217
1846941,5,B00008G80Z,"I saw Sandcastles for the first time last weekend because my mom had an old copy in our basement.  The movie is so old and not as enhanced as newer ones out today, but I fell in love with it the first time I saw it.  I'm 16 years old, and I can definately say that it's my favorite movie.  The story is so romantic and sad and it hits all your emotions.  I definately recommend it to everyone.",1047340800,,393,3.9367088607594938
1846942,2,B00008G80Z,"I've been searching for this movie for nearly 30 years.  It must have been a TV movie of the week or the like but I distantly remember loving it when I saw it.  It's a romantic fantasy with star-du-jour Jan-Michael Vincent and newcomer Bonnie Bedelia.  While I enjoyed seeing it again with my young daughter, I must comment on the extremely poor quality of the tape.  It looked like a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy.  The color was crummy, it was out of focus, and the sound came in waves, not just the waves in the movie, mind you.  Where does this stuff come from?  Anybody else out there searching for a movie to remind you of your youth, save yourself the 12.99.",1012780800,13,670,4.1875
1846943,3,B00008G80Z,"I purchased this movie as it was a memory of an old favorite and I wanted to share it with my girls. I found the video quality of the film to be rather poor.

1846944,5,B00008G80Z,"Someone finally has this movie!  I've been searching for this movie for years.  My husband was always searching for ""Friends"" (which he found)and I've always wanted a copy of ""Sandcastles"".  Watch this movie with your daughters, old girlfriends and new. It's my favorite movie memory from the 70's.  We can all remember the Jan Michael Vincent we loved!",993081600,,353,5.0344827586206895
