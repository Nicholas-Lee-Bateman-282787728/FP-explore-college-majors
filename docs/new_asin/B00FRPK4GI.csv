6030179,5,B00FRPK4GI,A good beginner yoga DVD.  I felt self conscious about going to a yoga class for the first time.  This DVD is a good way to learn some balance poses in the privacy of your own home.,1385078400,5,181,3.864864864864865
6030180,5,B00FRPK4GI,This is a fantastic DVD.  I bought it because balance is essential is everything from walking to jogging to dancing or just going down stairs.  What I found is that it is a great program for strengthening and toning your body with the added benefit of creating better overall balance.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their body in the convenience of their own living room.,1383955200,28,391,4.63768115942029

Regarding this one, however, I'm sending it back.  The poses that I CAN do are on her other videos.  I would recommend this one for an intermediate person.
I am a 70 yr old retired grandma who needs to hold onto a chair for balance - not for ALL of the poses, but for many of them.  I have arthritis in my lumbar spine, causing a weakness/pain in my right leg.
I highly recommend the videos I've listed above.  For persons in my stage of life, consider the ""Yoga for Seniors"" DVD.  It offers 3 levels - the easiest one is totally in a chair.

6030186,5,B00FRPK4GI,"This is a great DVD to help with balance.  I've been doing yoga for about 10 years, but my balance is really wobbly so I wanted a video that just focused on balance.  I did all of the practices initially, but now I just do the 1st one that is 19 min. on a rotation and whichever balancing one that seems right for the day and I always end with the relaxation.  I really like the foot exercises.  I didn't realize I was carrying so much tension in my feet and probably part of the reason why I can't balance very well.  I wanted to use this on a rotation with other yoga videos, so it took a little while to figure out how this would work and this works best.  It might be better if each section was a 20-30 min. full length yoga routine rather than being sort of random.  However, I was able to make it work.  My husband often does these with me and says he likes this one better than the other videos I have.",1492992000,2,909,4.011111111111111

So I ordered this DVD and have been able to get through most of the DVD but will have to work my way up to the last exercises. It is not too simple nor impossible so it seems to be just what I need to work on my balance.

6030200,5,B00FRPK4GI,"I really like this DVD.  Jane's explanation of how you balance and how to use your feet is so helpful for me.  Particularly since I have had plantar fasciitis since last year.  The shoe explanation and why you need to have room to move your feet is invaluable.  I wish I had this great DVD 30 years when I started wearing shoes that were wrong.  Now that I am 58 I have a lot of work to do to fix this problem.

Anyway, thank you Jane for your great video.  Keep up the good work.

Question for Jane: I just got started on this video, but I did scan through sections, if I can't get on the floor to do exercises (due to meniscus tear in knee & hip pain) can I do them in bed?",1484092800,5,675,3.911764705882353

6030207,5,B00FRPK4GI,"I started doing the practices from Jane Adam's Yoga For Seniors DVD series about a year ago.  I have recently graduated to this Stronger Standing Balance DVD, and the Intermediate Level - Level 2 has become my favorite.  I feel that my core strength, balance, and flexibility have significantly improved since I started the practices.  I seem to feel more connected to my body, and have a better sense of feeling connected to life around me.
I'm impressed with how the DVDs are planned, produced, and executed, and with how much thought and effort must have gone into the finished product. Jane Adams has a special gift as a Yoga instructor and I very much appreciate her distinctive soothing and nurturing vocal style. I'm a 60 something guy from suburban Philadelphia, PA and can state unequivocally that Jane's DVD Yoga Instruction has positively improved my health, happiness, and sense of well being.",1467244800,12,905,4.940789473684211

UPDATE:

Beware of this DVD! I've been doing yoga for many years, and never been injured. Shortly after doing the foot exercises, my foot was so sore, I couldn't walk. It's been almost two weeks, and my foot is still swollen.

6030214,5,B00FRPK4GI,"I was diagnosed with a vestibular deficiency in my right ear recently after a car accident.  I was told by my doctor that picking up an activity like Thai Chi or Yoga might help increase my balance, as I frequently experience vertigo from the injury and will have to cope with that for the rest of my life.  With that being said I love this DVD.  Its something that teaches me positions that specifically increasing balance.  Its also quite a workout, which is something that I need to be honest as well.

6030236,5,B00FRPK4GI,"I got interested in working on balance after reading that the American College of Sports Medicine recommends neuromotor exercise (balance, agility, and coordination) as an essential component to improve and maintain physical fitness.  Balance is often integrated in fitness dvds, but I've found very few that are focused on specific routines to solely improve balance. This dvd does just that by starting with some easier movements and working toward more complex.  So there is something here for everyone.  I'm presently working through the routines and enjoying them very much. As an adult in my 50s, my balance is pretty good with some movements, not so good with others, and generally better on one side.  I'm looking forward to see how I progress and what kind of improvement can be made",1424563200,10,792,5.069230769230769

One of the reasons I began taking yoga classes was that I realized I must become proactive in my aging process.  Balance is a key element in navigating gracefully through our later years, and Jane's cd is the best thing going for enhancing and strengthening balance.

You can do your practice at home with this cd, starting with 'Awakening Muscles' and progressing your way through, choosing the level suitable for you.  The pacing is comfortable - you have time to watch and listen to Jane and move through the session unhurried and calmly.  Jane is conscientious about form and teaches it well.  It  feels like she is right there beside you.",1413676800,10,728,4.6328125

6030241,5,B00FRPK4GI,"I recently purchased the DVD by Jane Adams called Stronger Standing Balance.  I wanted a DVD that emphasized balance training but was a bit skeptical of this DVD because I was not familiar with Jane Adams so wasn't sure if I'd like her style of teaching.  I went ahead and ordered it anyway and was so impressed that I shared it with my sister right away and she liked it a lot so she ordered one too!

Jane's style of teaching in this DVD is just perfect for me.  Slow paced, very good instructions, and I liked the background music.  Very good introductory segment on understanding balance, lots of segments to choose from and I thought it was really fun as well.  Being in my early 60's, I want to maintain and even improve my balance, muscle strength and flexibility as I get older and that is what I think this particular DVD will help me do.

6030245,5,B00FRPK4GI,"Last summer I noticed a difference in my balance. I wasn't able to put my pants on without holding on to something. When I tripped I fell. I even broke a rib while camping. When I hiked or even went for a walk I would use my hiking poles. Thanks to Jane Adams Yoga Class my useless sleepy feet woke up. I noticed a difference after only one class so I purchased her Stronger Standing Balance DVD. One of the things she teaches in the DVD is to practice your balance exercises thru out your whole day. I find that challenging and fun to do. When I hit the hiking trail at Lone Pine State Park this spring I totally forgot my poles only to find out I didn't need them. I tripped on the way down and regained my balance without falling. Too cool! By the way, I just turned 65, I live in Montana and I'm now able to do the things I moved here to do!

6030248,5,B00FRPK4GI,"As a yoga teacher I look at many DVDs, to see what others are doing.  I give this five stars because balance is often over looked in yoga studio classes; the poses in many classes are done with speed, so the student never gets a good idea of their level or lack of balance.  Also, as one grows older balance is extremely important to maintain balance, to avoid injury. Jane did a great job on this DVD; the background music is not over powering, yet very serene & although she gives great instruction, she is not overly talkative  like so many instructors.  Lets face it; everyone needs to work on balance & I highly recommend this one.",1396051200,15,636,4.410256410256411

I bought this video to help me keep up the improvement I saw with balance - especially when I can't get out much because of snow.

Last winter, at the age of 61, I tried ice skating for the first time in my life. It was not a pretty sight. I started taking adult figure  skating lessons through our local club, and after three months I still lacked confidence (skating forward on one foot was a real challenge for me). I discovered that I even had trouble standing on one foot on a hard floor wearing shoes!

I purchased Stronger Standing Balance, and over the summer I did the14 minute Balance Exercise routine about 5 times a week. When I started skating again in September, I was astounded by the improvement. Long glides on one foot are now simple for me, and my placement of the skates on the ice is dramatically better. I attribute this not only to the balance exercises but also to your emphasis of awareness of foot placement while doing them.

Im now skating three days a week and doing your Balance Exercises, along with the Standing Poses, on the non-skating days. Once I feel that I have mastered those, Ill move on to the Level One, Two, and Three Yoga Balances.

Many thanks to Jane Adams for producing this excellent DVD!",1511654400,,1170,4.5260663507109005

8618346,5,B00FRPK4GI,"I've never been the best at balancing, but as I get older, I seem to be getting worse.  I don't fall down in the street or anything like that, but it seems like when I'm in yoga class, everybody else can do the balance poses better than me. ;)  So I got this DVD to do at home to help me improve.  I'm very impressed with the variety and challenge of the exercises.  The DVD is separated into segments so that you can start with easier exercises, and then move on to more challenging ones as you progress.  While I can't yet walk a tightrope above New York City, I do believe this DVD is helping a lot.  In any case, I feel good physically and mentally after I do it, and I'll continue with it.",1504137600,2,694,4.0661764705882355
8618347,4,B00FRPK4GI,"When I joined a gym about 5 years ago, I found out right away that I have very poor balance.  While everyone else was standing around on one foot, I could not do it.  I have gotten better but I look forward to this DVD helping me to work at home on improving balance. So far I have liked the DVD and I appreciate that Jane Adams has a workout for strengthening the ankles and feet which I need as well as working core.",1503705600,2,418,3.9642857142857144
