Couldn't close my mouth while I was watching it. Intense. Beautiful.

7667274,5,B01BTBH5DS,"I catch myself rewatching this film time and time again. I can't help but fall in love with Colin McCormack, played by ruggedly handsome Gerald McCullouch; he is a happy go lucky, charming, compassionate, romantic at heart who extends his warm and furry embrace to Thaddeus ""T"" Bloom, played by perfectly awkward Jaime Cepero. T's extremely calculated persistence and tenaciousness to get Colin's attention, illustrates the spell we often endure and lengths we stretch to get to know that special someone. Colin's desire and willingness to comfort, love, and take care of T is endearing, and the relationship which develops between them is so rich and warm. Colin's best friend and neighbor, Stuart, played by comical and handsome Dan Via, provides remarkable insight for the immense value of long lasting relationships; Stuart portrays the very special friend who helps unearth our best intentions, slap us when we need it, brush off our shoulders and back while lifting us up after falling down, and welcomely intrudes in different episodes of our lives which are (to him) need to know! The story is raw and emotional, and the talented cast give it life, while surpassing the incredible twist. Gerald McCullouch directed the hell out of this film, all the while showing off and infusing all the special elements essential for the making of a timeless and thrilling film.",1504224000,,1372,5.075221238938053
7667275,5,B01BTBH5DS,"The characters and actors great! For example, Stew is very attaching, not always nice but he is still the good friend (always good advice, always the right words even it's hard to hear)Colin is terribly charming, Gerald McCullouch beauty works very well. In my opinion, he is the most fascinating character (he has a lot of success with men, in his career and shows a lot of assurance, in spite of that he is fragile)

This movie has managed to touch me and to make me cry. It's really a good movie.",1503187200,,499,4.423913043478261
7667276,4,B01BTBH5DS,"To start, the quality of this disc just sucks. The playback is broken, and on my copy the entire last 30 minutes are just corrupt data. The quality of the disc is so poor that the film is literally unwatchable. Its embarrassing and the LGBT community deserves so much better. This obviously sucks and the publisher needs to take note; if the disc is incapable of playing the film you need to figure out a higher quality of production.

The film itself is quality. Great performances, a good level of technical professionalism, and a story that entertains and challenges its viewer with a genuinely fresh twist ending (too bad the disc makes the ending unwatcahble so I guess I will have to wait until my refunded copy to know for sure). This is also one of perhaps 10 or less movies that tackle intergenerational homosexual relationships, period, so that considered its good to have a legitimately engaging movie built around that topic.

Overall, this is a pretty good film; 4 out of 5 stars. Its an interesting story that has never been told until now. People of the LGBT community, especially gay men who have intergenerational relationships, should check this one out. In a subgenre of a subgenre where you have less than 10 films in existence, ""Daddy"" proves that such stories should not only be told, but can be told very well. Its truly just a shame that the quality of the disc is so awful; be prepared to have the otherwise awesome movie interrupted by glitches and hiccups and don't be too surprised when you find yourself requesting either a copy that actually works or a full refund.",1502064000,,1595,4.692857142857143

There were a few problems with continuity where a little more detail would have helped round out the story. The acting wasn't bad but Colin and T could use a bit more time and experience. I doubt it'd they will do it, but a remake after there acting has matured a bit, it could be a much better film. It did have a little choppiness that was distracting but there were some shots of Pittsburgh that were gorgeous in the segues.

I will not reveal too much because there are surprises and truths to be told, the young man seems to have too many secrets and as to what they are? I am not going to say.

I was hoping for a happy story about ""daddies"", but it was a riveting drama.  Gerald and Dan were outstanding.  They were excellent actors.  The kid was good and I am So Glad that the movie used a man of color in the role.  So few gay themed movies have people of color, and I hope to see more of this.  I hope that Gerald and/or Dan get behind other projects.  Those that say they saw the twist coming are lying.

7667310,2,B01BTBH5DS,"I bought this because I was a fan of Gerald McCullouch from the web series ""Hustling.""  The director (Gerald McCullouch) overindulges his leading actor (again, McCullouch) and allows him to give a mannered, almost out of control performance.  I'm always turned off when actor/directors give themselves vanity shots showing off their bodies (think Barbra Streisand's slow pan of her legs in ""Prince of Tides"").  Aside from his performance which is distracting, he gets uneven performances from his supporting cast with the exception of Tamlyn Tomita, who doesn't know how to give a bad performance.  If you remember Jaime Cepero from his horrendous character on the TV series ""Smash"" his performance in this won't alter your negative opinion.  He is supposed to be the object of McCullouch's lust but his character and performance is extremely off-putting.  Dan Via who plays the David Hyde Pierce role eventually calmed down and gave a winning performance.  I will say that I was not expecting the plot twist and am sorry the premise was wasted on such a disappointing movie.  I think if the movie had been in the hands of another director, McCullouch would have given a better performance and the movie would have impressed me more.",1480723200,,1233,5.039408866995074
7667311,5,B01BTBH5DS,"Just finished watching ""Daddy"" released by Breaking Glass Pictures.
At first glance ""Daddy"" may appear to be a comedy about an older man who finally meets the one young man he just can't kick out of bed the morning after.  What ""Daddy"" really is an intense study about the need for acceptance and success; and the shocking lengths a highly dysfunctional young man goes to in order to be accepted by someone he wants to love him.
SPOILER & PRUDE ALERT - The twist in ""Daddy"" is going to be shocking and discomforting to a good many people I suspect because it deals a taboo topic - unintentional incest between a father and his biological son.
""Daddy"" was written by actor Dan Via - who based the movie on his stage play by the same name, who also stars in this movie as the best friend to Colin McCormick (played by Gerald McCullouch) a political columnist and co-anchor of a popular regional television show  that is similar to Crossfire.
A handsome intern catches his attention and Colin manages to have him assigned to him to help him dig up dirt on an anti-gay minister who is supposed to be pro-family, but has a mistress.
Colin just wanted eye candy around the office; but a sudden change of plans has him and the intern having dinner, which includes drinks, conversation, a drunken kiss on the way home, a horrified Colin, but a willing young man who has, it's revealed in one telling scene emotional issues that he is struggling with.
Colin's best friend is a bit jealous of the relationship between the two; but when the young man has an emotional breakdown, he puts the pieces together and discovers the real identity of the young man - much to Colin's sheer horror.
It seems that to raise money in college, Colin was a frequent donor.
Upon the discovery that he unknowingly slept with his biological son - Colin goes on a drunken binge and downward spiral until he manages to pull himself back up by his bootstraps.
""Daddy"" is an absorbing psychological drama about wrong choices and owning up to them to make them right.
Strongly Recommended.
Five Stars!",1478390400,2,2066,4.611413043478261
7667312,4,B01BTBH5DS,"Gerald McCullouch is a dream daddy.  Not to give the ending away, but there's a twist at the end that was more than a little shocking.  Still, this was a nicely acted, independent movie.  A little dark, a little sexy.",1477008000,,217,4.375

7667314,5,B01BTBH5DS,"Gerald McCullouch poured his heart and soul into DADDY : the Movie, and it shows! Colin McCormack (McCullouch) has it all. An enviable job, all the luxuries a single gay man can enjoy, a best friend of many years, good looks, and irresistible to other gay men. And the young males looking to share his bed line up, number in hand.

Stew is Colin's best friend. Apparently less lucky in the looks and love department, he is nonetheless essential to Colin, being the voice of wisdom and friendship. Kudos must be given here to Gerald McCullouch and Dan Via for portraying a believable, touching and emotional friendship, devoid of the ""let's jump in bed"" trap that so many gay movies fall into.

Jaime Cepero portrays Tee Bloom, an intelligent and brilliant 22 years old, with whom Colin will fall in love. The young man harbors a dark secret, poisoning his existence, and ultimately Colin's. The revelations will definitely propel Colin in the dark recesses of hell.

An ensemble cast aptly support the trio, led by Richard Riehle, as the boss of Colin, Jay Jackson, and Tamlyn Tomita among others.

McCullouch started a Kickstarter campaign, which gave the boost needed to make the original play step from the theater to the cinema. Many of the people involved gave their time to ensure the success of the movie. A real labor of love. And what McCullouch and his teammates made with a shoestring budget is to be seen to be believed.

Finely acted, charismatic and believable characters, and a powerful story all contribute to present the future of gay-themed movies, where those movies step out of the closet, and become stories that can be seen and felt by moviegoers of all sexual orientations.

It was his debut as a director and he shows that he has more talent than a lot of the directors out there today. It is a shame that this movie is mainly for the LGBT community because I believe that the mainstream could benefit from it also.

What first starts out as an overly keen employee soon becomes something much more intense, but when something is too good to be true.... well you know how it goes.

Now this is from TLA and yet is one of theirs that raises the bar. It is well made, acted. Scripted, filmed and everything else. The story is believable and engaging and the twist I never saw coming. It is also an indie and stars Gerald McCulloch as Colin who also directed this, he is a seasoned actor and the calibre shone through, but Jamie Cepero as Thaddeus was brilliant too and all the part players never let the side down.

7667365,5,B01BTBH5DS,These men have created a great and interesting film with a seriously freaky ending. I mean honestly who saw that one coming? What I like most about this film is that it is forcing all of us to have conversations on topics such as what does being a DADDY in gay world really mean? Should older men be able to mentor and encourage young men under 30 to be themselves and not buy into organized thinking? What if there is ever that chance that YOU may be an actual father with the young man you are dating? This film challenges us to really look inside ourselves and examine whether or not younger and older relationships can be great if done the right way. I will also commend them on not making this your typical gay film with all the sex and nudity and over the top drama queens. This is a serious film tackling serious topics while entertaining us at the same time. So I give it five stars! Look for my interview with Gerald in Bear World Magazine this summer!,1462579200,3,961,4.314917127071824

7667368,5,B01BTBH5DS,"Many younger gays have no recollection that there was a time when gay themed films were a rarity. Many were self produced, not very well written and filmed amateurishly . Still we supported gay cinema in the hope that one day it would grow up to become the voice of many. Fast forward to Daddy. The film is well acted and well written and you don't see the plot twist coming.  The DVD has so many extras that it is worth the purchase price. Music by NY underground sensation Corey Tut fills out the spectrum and elevates the scenes appropriately. The Corey Tut interview as part of the bonus feature has Gerald McCullouch hitting some pretty hefty notes as he sings along with Corey during the interview as well. McCulloch did a fine  job with acting and directing this vehicle and Duderonomy Jones subtly stole the film with his controlled performance. All in all, it speaks of our modern day complications with love, life, friendships, heartaches and family drama but we always manage to be overcome everything with the strength of friends who become our family.",1461974400,10,1064,4.71505376344086

There is such an honesty in his acting and he has transferred that same sincerity into his feature film directorial debut. Many may think Daddy to be the standard gay-themed sex comedy (due to the title), but they would be sorely mistaken. Dan Via has adapted his complex stage play for the film and does double duty by wonderfully playing the best friend. At the core of this story, it's all about relationships and families that we create. I found myself very moved by this film and recommend for those looking for something different from the usual Hollywood gay fare.",1461888000,17,706,4.566929133858268

7667376,4,B01BTBH5DS,"Shocking, traumatic, mind-boggling, I could go on, but these are only a handful of the descriptors regarding the denouement of this film. I have seen Gerald McCullouch in many short films and series (The Hustler Series, D.T.L.A, et al), and liked his acting, so it was nice to see him wearing two hats (director and star) in this feature length production with such an intriguing title. The story is well crafted (Dan Via, writer) in that we have many intertwining themes: friendship, family, aging, but the most interesting theme of all is that of family. In this age of IVF, sperm donation, surrogates, etc., the bright lines of what family is, have become far less so and we have entered a sphere in which the science has far outpaced the human spirit. The technology of procreation, in particular, sperm donation, has created a subset of individuals searching for identities (fathers) and some, perhaps many, are not having much success. For these searchers, their spirits long to connect to a person, to an individual and although some might do so ineptly, they feel compelled to do it risking and perhaps not even conscious of their actions, until their searching ends in disaster or simply a dead end. For those of us who suffer unknown paternity, the pain is unrelenting, the desire to know unquenchable. We, as a society, must come to terms with the ethics of the technology that bestows parenthood on virtually anyone who can afford it, with the right of an individual born as the result of that technology to live confidently and securely, knowing who made their life possible.",1461369600,,1588,4.863468634686347
7667377,4,B01BTBH5DS,"First of all, Gerald McCullouch is as genuine a person when you meet him as he is on screen. I happened to be on a train (subway) in NYC and he was standing feet away happily tuned in to some music. I'd just seen every episode of a webseries in which he'd had a strong supporting role, which a friend of mine had been asked to do a guest spot in. But since that was my only experience of Mr. McCullouch's work I was not positive it was him. Still, the chance to tell him (if my feeling of who it was, was right) how real he'd made that role was one I was ready to risk approaching the wrong person over - so I did.  His response made clear he was truly touched. In fact he took time after we spoke to come over to where I was before leaving the train to let me know I'd made his day. To give a broader picture I am a hetero female - and also a scriptwriter of film and TV. What counts to me from a seat in the audience is whether I can feel the emotions on screen. To me - relationships are relationships. We are all members of the same tribe - humankind. Shakespeare wrote for royalty and masses in the very same play - because Shakespeare knew more than Freud when it came to the exploration of the human psyche. And when it comes to film, tv and theatre (to paraphrase a line from Bill Clinton's presidential campaign), 'It's the psyche, People!' Distributors of film need to see there is an audience for films about love of every hue and type.

On that day on the train, Gerald told me he was working on a film named 'Daddy' and to be on the lookout for it. Time to time I would remember - and this time when I looked it up, there it was. How wonderful to see a film made from a script both The Bard and Sophocles would find a page turner (kudos to you, Mr. Via). As to the acting, it is a feat to direct oneself - and Gerald, you hit your stride and kept it once we got to the scene (early on) where you find out an uncle has died (although you likely shot out of sequence of course - take the credit even so : ). Mr. Via, I can only say you deserve to be cast over and over again having turned in this performance. You were real as it gets, Sir. And Mr. Cepero, I truly felt your pain.  I felt each character's pain, in fact.  Those reading this review should know they are in for an atypical ride, as others have noted. But thankfully not one which steps too far from plausible.  For indeed, one mistake we humans make can create a domino effect that spills in on us in the end.  It is having the ability to take the wide-aperture view, which allows us to come to points of forgiveness - not only of others, but of ourselves.

And the twist at the end comes as a shock both to the protagonists and the audience. The film was heartwarming and bittersweet and the performances were just on point. Gerald McCullouch delivers a trully compelling performance and Dan Via (whom I watched for the first time and I hope I see more of him in the future) did a brilliant job making his character believable and realistic.
