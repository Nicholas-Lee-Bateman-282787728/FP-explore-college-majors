4839054,5,B005MXQD74,"There is no way to really summarize this ""history."" Most of these mini-narratives or essays are attempts to come to terms with the images relation to life (film images primarily but considerable attention is also given to painting and photography) and most of these mini-narratives or essays are more suggestive of possible and often contradictory meanings than of literal ones. Although sex and death are by far the most iterated themes of this history just as they are the most iterated themes of most histories, it's Godard's artful way of representing these themes (using other people's images) that make them so interesting.

Visually, Godard provides us with a collage of clips from Chaplin, Hitchcock, Rossellini, Vigo, Renoir, Cocteau, and countless other films intermixed with art history stills & all is accompanied by both a musical soundtrack and a poetic ""narrative"" (sometimes in Godard's voice, sometimes in a kind of Alphaville distorted voice & sometimes the narrative is read by select actresses who perform the narrative as if it were a script they are learning). This multi-media collage is ripe with suggestive juxtapositions but any stable or solid meanings dissolve as quick as each image. In telling these histories, Godard allows himself more than a margin of indefiniteness.

Certain phrases nonetheless resonate:

""We are one another.""

""The myths by which we live are contradictory.""

""Cinema has always yearned to be more real than life.""

At one point Godard is interviewing a film historian who claims that the New Wave filmmakers were perfectly situated to tell the history of cinema because they arrived at a moment when film had a history that was rich but short enough to be absorbed by a single generation. Godard agrees somewhat, but adds that film history is connected to other histories and that for each filmmaker that history is a personal one based on that filmmakers own selection of influences. Godard claims that for some filmmakers like Truffaut, it was immediately apparent what their version of that history was and in what way they were adding to it. But Godard claims that for him it has taken many years to figure out film history and his relation to it.

What resonates in my mind after a single viewing is that Godard views cinema much as Lou Reed views rock n roll in the song ""Rock n Roll."" In that song, rock n roll offers release from the tedium and uncertainty of actual life and of actual living. For Reed (or Reeds character in the song) rock and roll is a kind of salvation, a kind of redemption. Because it offers a new kind of energy, a new kind of release, and because it lasts, its the one thing that makes this transitory existence tolerable. That seems to be Godards view of cinema (or at least one of his views of cinema).

But thats merely a summary of one of Godard's moods, there are many Godard's at work here. The beauty of this history is that no two viewers will likely translate these Godards and his myriad-minded histories in their own way.",1323475200,46,3018,4.846601941747573

8479939,5,B005MXQD74,"If you are a fan of avant-garde film, a Jean-Luc Godard fan, a film history buff, or all of the above, this collection will blow your mind. The swirling stream of images, upon examination, embraces practically the entire history of film, in a poetic subjectivity that invites participation. I offer that this set of film essays can be viewed as a fruitful counterpoint against Mark Cousins' amazing ""The Story of Film"" documentary. While Cousins reveals the extent of global cinema, Godard delves into the texture of the medium, its ethical conundrums, and then leaves the viewer with the satisfaction of something truly original. This is a French language production: the subtitles are adequate, though I would expand them if I could.",1419811200,5,735,5.082644628099174
8479940,5,B005MXQD74,"There is something haunting about this series, but also enigmatic to the core.  The images remain with you, which you would expect from one of the great image makers in cinematic history.  But what does it all mean?  I'm not sure, but I just like to sit and take it all in.  Maybe some day the meaning will dawn on me, but after all isn't the point of cinema to 'experience' something, and this series delivers on that promise.  I recommend it mainly for cineastes.  Other viewers might only 'experience' a WTF.",1399852800,5,511,4.5
8479941,5,B005MXQD74,"If you are looking for a BBC-type ""objective"" documentary on the history of cinema, look elsewhere.  But if you love some of Godard's work and are well-acquainted with early cinema, you will treasure Histoire(s) du Cinema.  Be aware that it is a very dense work, especially for non French speakers who have the additional task of reading subtitles amidst the torrent of sound and image.  It takes time to absorb and to appreciate.  Don't expect to sit down and knock out 3-4 episodes in one sitting like it's a season of your favorite television show.  Allow yourself time to think about what Godard is saying, also to repeat episodes even while in the process of going through the set for the first time.",1356912000,7,705,4.699186991869919
8479942,5,B005MXQD74,"Not knowing much about cinema through the ages, I just watched it cold and found it to be a bizarre, yet transcendent film experiment, sounds everywhere, different talking, music, flipping images. I would just consider it a filmic work of art commenting on, referring to, responding to, and re-purposing all kinds of artifacts and repercussions related to film. I would like to have a full transcription, but I suppose I'd read that separately. The film is just an experience of all senses.",1346976000,11,490,4.987804878048781
8479943,1,B005MXQD74,"After reading a promising review of Godard's ""Histoires du cinema"" which sounded intriguing, I bought the silly thing.  I always try to be opened minded and give everyone a chance but one thing a filmmaker should not do is to bore you to death.  Needless to say, I didn't make it through the first disc - I fell asleep about 2/3 in - and I really tried to stay with it.  Talk about repetitive, boring, non-sensical, mostly pretentious and boring and boring and I'll say boring one more time to show how boring can be... Maybe it picks up and gets better in the later discs as he worked on this over many years.  How it played on French TV in its present form and kept an audience is beyond me.  I mean Luc Besson is French and loves the movies (I'm sure) but I'd like to see him stay with this ""documentary of the movies""... This really gives true meaning to WTF?... maybe that was Godard's intention.  I have always been a fan of French cinema for years - Truffaut, Renoir, Cocteau, Clouzot, Beineix and Jeunet to mention only a few... But I've always felt he was overrated.  I would like all Jean-Luc Godard fans to get this dvd and view it to the end - I dare you.",1330732800,6,1167,4.277272727272727
8479944,2,B005MXQD74,"Cinema doesn't deserve to be treated this amateurishly. I realize this is personal statement, but his disconnected use of film images and his utterly pointless narrative don't conjure any subconscious subtext or personal insights. What's the point of sitting through four hours of this? At least Italian cinema received slightly good treatment.",1327536000,7,344,5.634615384615385
8479945,2,B005MXQD74,"This work of Godard is a  grandiose masterpiece. It's a sure thing, no doubt about it, IT MUST BE SEEN, it's a 10 out of 10.

But, this DVD edition forget one thing: some people don't need any subtitles, some people are french or speak french. So let's them the choice to watch this masterpiece without subtitles! I was so upset when I realize the subtitles were ""obligatory"". DVD 101: the choice for the spectator to watch with or without subtitles.

Then, it's really the minimum. But anyway, Histoire(s) du Cinma is a monument, so it doesn't really matter if there is not supplements.",1327190400,22,587,4.625
8479946,5,B005MXQD74,"Required viewing for all Godardophiles. Will require multiple viewings to understand and appreciate the depth and detail of his vision. This is essentially an American release of the film that Gaumont released in Europe a few years ago. There are English subtitles, but the nature of the film's structure make a complete subtitling of all the dialogue and the intertitles virtually impossible. Highly recommended for any lover of the cinema...",1325030400,28,443,5.3428571428571425
