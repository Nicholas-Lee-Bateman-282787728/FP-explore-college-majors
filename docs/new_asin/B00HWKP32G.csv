6240473,5,B00HWKP32G,"A visual treat that takes you on the equivalent of a slow-paced hike to some of the most special places in Rocky Mountain National Park.  The narrative is spare, leaving the viewer to experience the quiet joy of fishing through beautiful images and the thoughts they conjure.  Josh covers several must see destinations and all the seasons. Worth multiple viewings!",1392076800,2,364,5.05
6240474,5,B00HWKP32G,"For anyone that enjoys the magnitude of the mountains along with the joy of fly fishing, this is a must own video. This video brings my own child-like excitement for RMNP to the screen. Josh Rickard has done a fantastic job capturing some of the splendor and beauty of this fantastic national treasure. Simply beautiful!",1389916800,2,320,4.836363636363636

8636950,5,B00HWKP32G,"I bought this film as I am planning a trip to the park. It's a good film and I've watched it several times. While not full of monster fish and rock music like a number of other films, I found it relaxing. I wish it was a bit longer so they could add more info on the places, but I was happy with it.",1435017600,,299,3.6875
8636951,4,B00HWKP32G,"The trend of fly fishing videos is punk rock music, short action sequences, and a bunch of bro'ing all around.  I'm glad that this video was more down to earth, and didn't seem like an over the top production.  Great scenery shots, decent action shots, and a nice run down on the opportunities to fly fish RMNP.",1427846400,2,311,4.43859649122807
8636952,4,B00HWKP32G,Good Movie to inform you of all the areas for Fishing and sight seeing.,1426636800,,71,4.142857142857143
8636953,5,B00HWKP32G,"Fantastic film! This documentary highlights the beauty's of Rocky Mountain National Park through the eyes of a passionate angler and conservationist. The visuals are breathtaking and for a fisherman looking to scratch the itch, look no further. Well worth the money spent!",1400457600,,272,5.5
8636954,3,B00HWKP32G,"Not the most well produced documentary but great pics of the park and trout.  Got what I needed from this one, a little daydreaming on a gloomy, rainy day.",1395360000,,155,4.344827586206897
8636955,5,B00HWKP32G,"This is a great film depicting areas in which to fish while hiking in an amazing landscape. In fact, catching a beautiful, wild trout, as crazy as it seems, is just a bonus. My wife and I have been to RMNP twice now and are going back again this fall and we can't get enough of it. It was awesome to see all of the areas we have been to and where we also caught some beautiful trout. This would be a great purchase for someone planning to visit the park whether you are an experienced fly fisher, novice, or someone who just likes beautiful places. A great companion would be to also purchase the book ""A Fly Fishing Guide to Rocky Mountain National Park"" by Steve Schweitzer or ""Fly Fishing Rocky Mountain National Park"" by Todd Hosman. They were invaluable during our last trip. This film isn't a how-to video on fly fishing, what flies to use, nor what fly gear or hiking gear to bring, nor was it meant to. It was meant for the general public saying: ""Hey, you too can experience this and please help preserve it!""",1395014400,2,1018,4.335078534031414
8636956,5,B00HWKP32G,"I think the point of the film is to show how to enjoy the beauty of the park while preserving it for future generations and catching some beautiful, wild fish along the way. It is a great film depicting areas in which to fish and get some great exercise hiking with an amazing landscape.

A great companion would be to also purchase ""A Fly Fishing Guide to Rocky Mountain National Park"" by Steve Schweitzer or ""Fly Fishing Rocky Mountain National Park"" by Todd Hosman. They were invaluable during our last trip. I think Susan's analysis is not quite right. The film wasn't meant for serious fly fishers wanting intelligent information or exquisite videography. It was meant for the general public saying: ""Hey, you too can experience this!""",1394841600,2,1015,4.521739130434782
8636957,5,B00HWKP32G,"I watched this film on a cold, dreary winter morning while recovering from a head cold, and, it was the perfect thing to lift me out of my funk. Set in beautiful Rocky Mountain National Park, the film includes stunning shots of lakes, streams, marsh areas, and peaks from start to finish. We follow anglers to some of the best fishing spots in the park, while learning about environmental stewardship related to fishing in Colorado. Fly fishing gives me a unique feeling of happiness and relaxation, and I had that feeling during and after I watched this film. I felt as if I was transported to the side of a stream, in the spring time, with no one else around me. Well done.

A related note, I'm so glad that Amazon videos can now be streamed via Apple TV. It looked great on my TV!",1394841600,2,783,4.4
8636958,1,B00HWKP32G,Obviously director/producer has little knowledge of fly fishing.... would love to see someone make an intelligent documentary on fly fishing in Colorado with people who actually have years of experience in fly fishing CO waters!,1394150400,,228,5.542857142857143
