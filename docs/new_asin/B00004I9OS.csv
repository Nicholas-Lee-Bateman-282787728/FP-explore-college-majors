7920439,4,B00004I9OS,"Nowhere near as good as the book . . . don't even know why they have a ""body"" transfer. This is a simple rich trying to stay rich story with an active gun slinging resistance trying to fight back.",1427155200,,196,4.051282051282051
7920440,3,B00004I9OS,I ordered this movie because I am a fan of Karen Duffy.  She is a gorgeous woman and I wanted to see her in her only starring role.  This movie was not great by any means.  But Karen makes it watchable.  Recommended for fans of Duffy.,1409356800,,234,4.021739130434782
7920441,2,B00004I9OS,"I purchased this film at a VHS clearance sale under the title ""Synapse,"" and for the $5 I paid, I can't honestly say I was disappointed.  Karen Duffy is a solid actress and manages to impart a little credibility to a character other actors and directors would have treated as a joke.  Perhaps I should explain that her character is essentially a man who has been framed for a murder and sentenced to live out his life in the body of his female victim.  There is some unexplained conditioning which apparently takes place off-camera in the early going, but as soon as the character breaks free of her/his conditioning, the film becomes a more standard sci-fi action film, mostly forgettable if not regrettable.  Apart from a handful of well-staged and well-performed scenes, the movie is little better than any number of B-movie futuristic action flicks.

The film, I've since learned, was initially based on the softcore transsexual porn novel, Season of the Witch, but I guess it strayed pretty far from its roots.  Whether or not that is a loss, you'll have to decide for yourself.  I did appreciate a couple of scenes which hint at (but fail to develop) the protagonist's gradual adaptation to her new body.  For my money, the film would have been better if Duffy had been given the chance to explore her character's confusion and conflicting emotional states a bit more, even if this came at the expense of the rather ham-fisted action scenes.",1355356800,3,1447,4.783132530120482
