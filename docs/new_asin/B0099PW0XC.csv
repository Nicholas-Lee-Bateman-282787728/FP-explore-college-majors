5295026,5,B0099PW0XC,"Hats off to the Roy Rogers Estate.  ""Roy Rogers-King of the Cowboys,"" 20 feature film, 6 DVD packaged set is a benchmark contribution to the lexicon of the mythology of the western movie cowboy and the belief system of American youth in the 1930s-1960s, the senior caretakers of today's American character.  Many/most of Roy's movies are in the public domain, and a number of companies have produced copies of many of those movies in their current state of repair/dispair.  Now comes the Roy Rogers Estate to save that legacy.  The collection is from the Happy Trails Theater series programs.  Roy and Dale screen their movies with guests including Roy ""Dusty"" Rogers, Jr., Gene Autry, Pat Buttram, Pat Brady, Penny Edwards, Ruth Terry, Iron Eyes Cody, and Roy's lifetime agent Art Rush whose only contract with Roy was a handshake.  With restorative care, the estate has trusted Timeless Media Group to restore and compile 20 Roy Rogers movies.

The collection provides two movies not readily available to DVD collectors until now--""The Golden Stallion"" (previously readily available on VHS) and ""Pals of the Golden West"" (Roy's last Republic western in 1951), generally not available until now.  There are early and later black & white classics--""Sons of the Pioneers,"" ""Young Hickok,"" ""Don't Fence Me In,"" ""Man From Oklahoma,"" ""Rainbow Over Texas,"" ""Sunset in El Dorado"" (script originally for Dale when it was thought that Roy would be drafted in WWII), ""South of Caliente,"" ""In Old Amarillo,"" ""Along The Navajo Trail,"" ""Spoilers of the Plains,"" and ""Cowboy and the Seniorita"" (Roy and Dale's first movie together).  From the Tru-color period of 1947-1950, there are ""Trigger, Jr."" ""Down Dakota Way,"" ""Trail of Robin Hood,"" ""North of the Great Divide,"" ""Bells of Coranado,"" ""Twilight in the Sierras,"" and ""Susanna Pass.""  There are also some nice bonus features from the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum, ""Roy Rogers Biography,"" ""Sidekicks,"" and Roy Rogers Museum Tour Hosted by Roy ""Dusty"" Rogers, Jr.

As much as you will enjoy this collection from the 1938-1951 hayday of Roy Rogers westerns, it could be just the beginning.  The Roy Rogers Estate has all the Happy Trails Theater shows, 85 is the number I've heard, that can be additional issues in even more packages like this one.  Just think of a colorized ""My Pal Trigger,"" Roy's favorite of his movies.  No, it's not in this package, but it could be in the next one.  Why more packages?  Consider this...

Roy Rogers embodied a spirit of the American frontier, a spirit that is unique to the American experience.  Clean-living, God-fearing, hard work for an honest day's dollar, coupled with the enthusiasm, hope, and prayer for what we can become has bred a spirit of the Western Frontier unique in the American experience.  Because it is so basic, we can all relate to it.  Because it is right, we are drawn to it. Because Roy Rogers was the embodiment of that spirit for all of us, we will remember and venerate him all of our days.

This collection of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans movies needs to be in every library in the country so that our children will have access to the validation of the spirit that helped to shape modern America and can be ours for the future.",1276041600,27,3233,4.884615384615385
5295027,1,B0099PW0XC,"Amazon mistakes this release as a Shout Factory / Timeless Media Group Box Set. Alas, it is a Timeless Media set with the usual quality from this distributor: GARBAGE.
The packaging is horrible. It's in 3 slim cases holding two dics each. However, my set came with the dics loose in the case. The hub did not hold the dics in place.
The running times of the films are incorrect. The set gives the original running times giving the impression they are complete. However, almost all of the films are from the MCA TV prints running 53 minutes.
The picture quality is consistant with 16mm prints. The color however on most of the color titles are horrible. The hues go from pink to red, and are an embarrassment to watch.
BOTTOM LINE: These films deserve better, complete prints exist in the Republic Library so why use MCA prints? I cannot beleive that Roy's family approved this release.
Shout Factory PLEASE release these films with your usual great quality.",1388016000,9,957,4.7023809523809526
5295028,5,B0099PW0XC,"I bought this set at a local Cracker Barrel for $20. For the great value, $20 was way to low! Twenty feature films, plus bonus features, and getting to listen to Roy and Dale chat with friends and former co-workers make this a steal. The films are the cut versions, as they are being shown on the Happy Trails Theater. But the missing minutes are well worth it as the viewer gets to hear a little bit about life from Roy and Dale themselves. Roy and Dale introduce each film, and often times they have a guest with them. Gene Autry, Roy ""Dusty"" Rogers Jr., Penny Edwards, Ruth Terry, Iron Eyes Cody, and others chat with Roy and Dale for a few minutes before the film is started. This is a great package for any Roy Rogers and Dale Evans fan.",1381708800,,742,4.2695035460992905

5295032,4,B0099PW0XC,"Until the Roy Rogers films at Republic are restored to their original Trucolour and length, a box set like this is about as good as it gets. Sadly, some of the movies are shown here in their cut-down length for TV when they are readily available at their original running time elsewhere on VHS and DVD - ""Bells of Coronado"", ""Twilight on the Sierras', the wonderful ""Susanna Pass"", ""The Golden Stallion"". ""Trigger Jr"", ""Down Dakota Way"" etc. At least these films are shown in Trucolour. Others are in black-and-white, some as originally made, some because it seems the TV prints are the only ones to have survived.",1327795200,14,614,4.747663551401869
5295033,5,B0099PW0XC,This set is marvelous.  Roy and Dale introduce the shows and talk with guests who acted in the shows with them.  The DVDs are of very good quality.  I would highly recommend this set to anyone who is a Roy Rogers and Dale Evans fan.  They were wonderful people and spent their lives serving God and Country.  I would show these DVDs to children.  They could see how beautiful and clever Trigger was and why he was such a famous movie horse.  Well done Happy Trails Theatre!,1295913600,2,473,4.367816091954023
5295034,1,B0099PW0XC,"To say I was disappointed by this box set would be an understatement. With the exception of the Happy Trails Theatre wraparounds, the movies themselves are a disgrace. By viewing the films contained in this set, fans of Roy Rogers might be forgiven for ever believing that he was once a singing cowboy, since 95% of the original songs have been edited out. Pre 1949 titles were edited down by Republic Studios to 54 mins so that that along with commercial breaks they would fit into a one hour television time slot. Many of the titles contained here are post 49 titles, and in consequence were never edited to begin with. Therefore the obvious question to ask is why don't we have the full running times for THOSE titles at the very least. Let me tell the prospective buyer that not only do we not get the full running times for the later titles, but we don't even get the 54 min cutdown versions for the earlier ones!! What we get instead are running times of approximately 47 mins for all the films included here, with the one exception of ""Cowboy and the Senorita"", which for some reason appears unedited. The packaging is also misleading since it infers that the titles are uncut with running times corresponding to that contained in the original theatrical release prints. In some, but not all, the actual print quality of the films is inferior to that of even bootlegs. My suggestion is that unless you just want the wraparounds themselves and the two extras included, then you'd be better off to save your money and/or wait for someone to release better uncut versions of these titles.",1282348800,36,1592,4.648936170212766
5295035,3,B0099PW0XC,"Wow,

I am in the market for new DVD Roy Rogers movies, I was getting ready to puch the bitton to buy this item ubtil I read the review. WOW new does not always mean better!",1281052800,2,173,3.8055555555555554
5295036,1,B0099PW0XC,"Love Roy & Dale and all their films, but I just can't stand it when my favorite cowboy films get all butchered up!... For some reason the song SUSANNA PASS went buzzing through my head the other day so I reached for this newly bought set to enjoy the movie. Now, the dvd states the running time as 67 minutes which is the correct running time for this movie. However, during the first 10 minutes I noticed that things just didn't seem quite right. Too many quick splice/cuts. And then when Roy arrives at the jailhouse early on after chasing an escaped convict I remembered that a song seemed to be missing. So when I pulled out my old REPUBLIC PICTURES vhs double bill of this film along with SONS OF THE PIONEERS I not only noticed that the video tape print was clearer with better color contrast, but also that there were no early splice cuts, snipping a couple seconds here and there. And best of all, as Roy arrives at the jailhouse, Estrelita Rodriguez is singing the song TWO GUN RITA which is not on this dvd version!!!
Now I know that those in charge of marketing for the Roy Rogers estate claim that the songs were cut for tv release way back when and are now lost on the cutting room floor... So how come my old vhs tape from REPUBLIC PICTURES has the same movie intact running also at 67 minutes?
It seems to me that the missing time ( cut songs ) were done so that Roy & Dale could host their HAPPY TRAILS THEATER on tv and talk to guest stars, in this case Gene Autry & Pat Buttram. I have nothing against yackin' about old times and kindda like seeing it as a bonus feature...but when it means cutting the songs out of a singing cowboy movie, it grates me somewhat!
After all, according to the promo blurb for Roy & Dale's 4-disc cd collection of their movie songs ""...It was always the music.""!!!
Then, if so, why cut the music?
This film,and others, THE BELLS OF ROSARITA, UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS, etc are available uncut with all songs intact on cheap public domain lables, many of which offer better looking prints.
Shop wisely and avoid any release that is tied into the ROY ROGERS HAPPY TRAILS tv product. They're all cut versions! They're all missing the songs!
I love the songs and I love my movies uncut and I'm sorry to see such wonderful packaging wasted on such an inferior product.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",1279756800,80,2330,4.395833333333333

8538120,4,B0099PW0XC,"I actually enjoy this DVD set, the movies are there, picture quality is good (was good enough for broadcast TV in the 1980's), and the special extras and stories Roy and Dale tell before and after the films are terrific!  I love hearing the Rogers talk about their showbiz years.  Yes, a few minutes here or there might have been cut for TV, and maybe a particular song, but honestly, as a fan of ""action westerns,"" none of this bothers me that much to have prevented me from purchasing this collection.  I also have a feeling that these slightly edited for TV movies. . .  that were edited back in the 1950's. . .  are probably the only copies the Rogers Estate has in its vaults.  Folks, this is probably as good as it will ever get with these old films.  You could wait forever for all of Roy's movies to be digitally re-mastered, uncut, unedited . . . it probably will never happen.  I'm happy with these movies.  If you buy this set, and a few other large 20-movie DVD sets on Amazon, you can essentially have most of the ""best"" Roy Rogers movies that were made.",1436400000,2,1067,4.348484848484849
8538121,5,B0099PW0XC,"This 6 DVD set really brought back some memories. Roy and Dale Rogers were wonderful people as well as movie actors. They donated lots of their time as well as money to many charities and adopted several children. I'm sure that if your under 50-55 years old, you may not enjoy these 50's western movies. They don't have lots of violence and exploding buildings or foul language, just good ole westerns with a story and a lesson to remember. Crime does not pay and the bad guy always gets caught.",1429920000,,495,4.511111111111111
