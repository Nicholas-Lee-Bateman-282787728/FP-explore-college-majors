8453494,4,B005232Z5I,"I am reviewing not a physical DVD (how I wish that I were) but a decent print downloaded from YouTube with a regrettably harsh soundtrack. And I will refrain from any inevitable comparison to Minnelli's much-admired 1904 Exposition masterpiece (I believe it was called MEET  MARY ASTOR IN MISSOURI?).

CENTENNIAL SUMMER begs for restoration and studio-sanctioned DVD release if only for its important Kern and Preminger pedigree (and too for the Gish and Darnell connections). This is Kern's final score--he composed seven entirely new songs--introducing the standards ""In love in vain,"" ""All through the day"" and the minstrel production number ""Cinderella Sue."" Preminger followers value this film as a full-dress Fox preamble to CARMEN JONES and Goldwyn's PORGY AND BESS and will note the fluid camera movements which moderate seamlessly the transitions into song sequences and production numbers which are predictably lavish. The sweeping camera movements with bulky Technicolor equipment must have driven DP Ernest Palmer batty, but his work here is exquisite even in an online print. So too the elaborate 1876 period costumes (especially fetching on Linda Darnell) executed by Ren Hubert; these probably could not be duplicated today, at any price. Finally, the estimable Conrad Salinger in a prelude to his Freed Unit work at Metro contributed to the idiomatic orchestral arrangements.

Preminger predictably stresses the sisterly bitchery (cf. Bremer and Garland making nice in the Missouri movie) between Darnell and Crain, Dorothy Gish (cruelly seventh-billed, after nonentity William Eythe), even lovelier and less tetchy than her sibling, has her share of closeups and some delicious mimed comic moments, and Constance Bennett quite steals the show with her soign worldliness even as she seems to be eerily channeling Miriam Hopkins. Walter Brennan, bless his heart, had sung Foster and Handy on camera a decade earlier (John Cromwell's riparian drama BANJO ON MY KNEE) but is miscast in musical comedy and not wholly comfortable with Preminger's Vienna-in-Hollywood sophistication (Brennan is not the acidulous Clifton Webb, so we ought be grateful). The ravishing Linda Darnell, the ultimate Preminger Leading Lady, is most clearly attuned to the director's idiom, and this is one of her key films (was she not made for Technicolor, and it for her?). Preminger completists will value this film, in any condition, and Darnellists continue to hope for revival of Preminger's screwy THIRTEENTH LETTER, that rarity a Qubcois noir (I confess that not even Anne Baxter and Chateau Frontenac can make I CONFESS convincing; see Jack Cardiff's 1958 INTENT TO KILL as a Montreal alternative).

Kern completists are directed as well to his penultimate film songs radiantly introduced by Deanna Durbin in her only Technicolor musical, CAN'T HELP SINGING, which adumbrates SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS and would make a fine period double bill with a fully restored CENTENNIAL SUMMER. Both films are viable alternatives to the endearing but overfamiliar Minnelli film, where increasingly I wish Mary Astor or June Lockhart (both great Film Mommies) would dare to correct Margaret O'Brien's self-indulgent misbehaviors. (La Durbin does her own trilling in the earlier film, whilst here Crain is dubbed by Louanne Hogan, Darnell by Kay St. Germain Wells and Avon Long is undubbed in the memorable ""Cinderella Sue."")",1389484800,4,3415,5.425612052730696
8453495,1,B005232Z5I,I saw this movie when I was a little girl and loved it.  So it is not the movie but the seller. The DVD was very poor quality. It skipped and halfway through it stopped completely. Seller never responded to my emails. Don't waste your time or money with this seller!,1384905600,5,266,4.215686274509804
8453496,2,B005232Z5I,"the quality of the film is very poor, blurring, color is very poor. This is the 2nd film I have received in this condition, I will not be ordering from this seller  again.",1376265600,4,171,4.181818181818182
8453497,4,B005232Z5I,"The two other reviews summarize pretty well the ups and downs of this movie release.  The film is a good musical/romance that has Linda Darnell and Jeanne Crain as sisters battling for Cornell Wilde while both were at the peak of their careers as stars.  The story also centers on the competition of their mother with her own sister in from France for the Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876.  Walter Brennan is very good as the patriarch of a family gone slightly mad with love triangles.  The music is not Kern's best but the movie is more of a romance/comedy and the music is secondary.  The book is very entertaining if you get the chance and you can get a copy on Amazon for a penny usually.  The dvd copies available tend to be second rate knock-offs at this point, so buyer beware if you expect great quality.  Hopefully a good quality release will come from the studio at some point.",1359504000,10,901,4.5246913580246915
8453498,1,B005232Z5I,"VERY dissappointed in this dvd.  VERY poor quality , not what I am used to getting from Amazon. I will not buy from this dealer again. Dvd is blurry, distorted, color is very bad, and impossible to watch. I have requested a refund from this dealer but as yet have not heard from them. This is NOT good customer service!",1314835200,11,319,4.316666666666666
8453499,4,B005232Z5I,"1946's ""Centennial Summer"" based on a novel by Albert E. Idell and directed by Otto Preminger who later gloriously brought ""Porgy and Bess"" to the screen is a Disney-type story of Americana of two sisters played by Jeanne Crain and Linda Darnell. Darnell the next year starred in Otto's film version of ""Forever Amber"" with Cornell Wilde, who also is in ""Centennial Summer"" and plays a Frenchman who comes to town for the Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876 and who they vie for with their affections.  The rivalry between the sisters amidst the family consisting among others of Walter Brennan, Dorothy Gish and worldly ""Aunt Zenia"" played by Constance Bennett is enjoyable.  William Eythe plays Darnell's beau she strings along while making a play for what rightly belongs to Crain.  The score is by Jerome Kern with Jeanne Crain's songs dubbed by Louanne Hogan.  The expertly directed result is humorous and quite appealing, one's expectations for the story end up completely satisfied.  Even Otto's taste for controversy is employed when Eythe, who plans to be the first practicing obstetrician in the city has cause to raise eyebrows when Darnell goes to his office as a ""Miss.""  Preminger's filming of all black minstrels in a segment for a song titled ""Cinderella Sue"" anticipates his connection to ""Carmen Jones"" and ""Porgy and Bess.""  I could watch this film again and again.  Hollywood (even Disney) has lost its touch to do this kind of thing right.  I wish this DVD-R edition was released by the studio, but that is not the case.",1311897600,18,1551,4.934615384615385
