5967194,4,B00F40UBM8,"I was quite pleased to find this REGION-FREE Blu Ray Collection of the POLICE ACADEMY movies since a Region 1 USA Box Set has not yet been released.  Since this is a REGION FREE collection, these discs will play in ALL Blu Ray players no matter what country you're in!

So how do these movies look in High Definition?  Here's a breakdown, by movie!

-Police Academy- The picture quality here is about a 3.8 out of 5.  The film retains it's natural grain structure and looks pretty solid overall.  The image is sharp and I didn't notice much softness at all. A really good transfer!

-Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment- The picture quality here is just about as good as the first POLICE ACADEMY.  Again, deserving of a rating in the 3.8 range. Natural film grain is present, giving the flick the feel of its natural movie theater performance.

-Police Academy 3: Back In Training-  This was the one movie in the collection that seemed a bit different from the rest in terms of picture quality.  This one looks like they used some DNR to clean up the movie, and the trade off was that you'll notcie that ""waxy look"" effect quite often.  The close ups are generally fine, but a lot of times the waxiness appears in the background and occassionally right up front, depending on the scene.  This one rates about a 2.8 out of 5 due to this issue.  It's not all bad.  Again, the close ups are usually pretty good, but there are definitely issues with DNR being used too much.

-Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol- Now we are back to the general image quality found in this set but with a bonus.  This is the first time PART 4 has been available in a non FULL-FRAME aspect ratio.  Here, we finally see the film in it's full 1:85:1 widescreen aspect. (*just as a sidenote, YES, all the movies in this collection are in their original widescreen aspect ratio.) Picture quality here deserves about a 4.

-Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach- The picture quality here seems the best so far.  The movie looks sharp and consistent.  This one scores a 4.3 out of 5. Nice!!!

-Police Academy 6: City Under Siege- The transfer here isn't quite as good as PART 5, as part 6 seems to have a little bit dirtier print.  Still, not a bad print of the movie, it just isn't quite as nice as 5. Part 6 deserves about a 3.5 in terms of picture quality.

-Police Academy 7: Mission To Moscow- Surprisingly, the worst of the Police Academy movies seems to get the best transfer of them all.  Go Figure.  Atleast this movie wasn't as bad as I remembered it being back in 1994.  It was worth watching again, especially since this one gets a 4.6 out of 5 in terms of picture quality. Sharp and detailed, this mission is a winner in High Def.

Now that we have assessed the picture quality, how does the audio hold up?  The audio on them all seemed pretty much the same to me.  A few differences here and there but nothing worth docking points over.  These are the original audio tracks with modern proccessing.  A solid 3.7 out of 5 sums up the audio.  It's perfectly fine.

And what about the bonus features??  Well, unfortunately, the only bonus features on these discs are the same exact ones found on the DVD BOX SET COLLECTION.  They are all interviews from 2004, but fortunately most of the cast appear on these little featurettes found on each disc.  Many of the directors, as well as series producer Paul Maslansky appear as well.  The featurettes are fairly short ranging from about 5 minutes to 15 minutes or so.  Still, these are fun to have.  I'm glad they kept these.  It's just too bad there wasn't a nice NEW 60 minute retrospective about the whole series on the first disc.

And there we have it!  If you are a fan of the series, this set is a no-brainer!!  For under $50 for all 7 movies in High Definition, you can't go wrong.  I wish the packaging was better.  The boring yellow background with a police car was an odd choice.  Atleast they could have made the POLICE ACADEMY logo look like it did on all the movies.  I'm not sure why the packaging was done this way...but rest assured that the movies housed inside are in nice solid cases and are ready to light up your living room with laughter once again.",1396569600,17,4210,4.434725848563969

However, a number of the jokes that didn't make sense that I thought were due to just poor writing were actually due to the editing.  So, unfortunately, until I can edit out some parts, the movie isn't appropriate for my children, which I was hoping to show them - I've only shown them clips on youtube previously.",1489622400,,474,4.292134831460674

5967247,5,B00F40UBM8,"As a child growing up in the 80's, it was impossible to not have seen at least one of the Police Academy films. The first released in 1984 was a surprise comedy hit and along with other films such as ""Porky's"", ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Bachelor Party"" helped symbolize R rated comedy in the early to mid 80's. ""Police Academy"" was a huge success so sequels were released each subsequent year with the first sequel instead being rated PG-13 and the rest PG  as they were made with less raunchy humor which was featured in the first film and instead were targeting families. The quality and box office also dropped off with each sequel
before bottoming out with part 6 in 1989. A cartoon series also ran from 1988 to 1989 for 65 episodes. The film series would lie dormant for a few years before returning with the beyond awful seventh entry in 1994 which is rightfully regarded as one of the worst movies ever made. (There was also an equally bad live action television series which ran for a single 26 episode season in 1997-1998 but only the films are included with this blu-ray set.)

Warner Brothers saw fit back in 2013 to compile all 7 Police Academy films in a region free blu-ray box set which delivers exceptional value for fans. Each film gets its own disc and all extras from the previous DVD releases were carried over as well.

Each film is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen even though the packaging states 1.85:1 so you gain just a tiny bit of picture information on the top and bottom of the frame. The discs utilize the AVC codec and are a significant improvement over the previous DVD releases. Detail is much improved and it appears that no digital scrubbing was done so each film retains a nice natural grain structure. The bit rates for the first two films hover around the upper teens and low to mid 20's for the most part but the 3rd through 7th entries feature more robust bit rates getting into the mid to upper 30's during busy sections which leads me to believe that parts 3 through 7 feature more recent scans. Audio for the first 6 films is presented in lossless 1 channel mono for the default English track and 2 channel lossless stereo for part 7. There are also lossy audio options for French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese dubbed tracks for importers. Subtitles are also included for each audio option too and then some.

While the Police Academy film series is by no means high art, the first film is definitely an 80's comedy classic while the 2nd and 3rd entries have their moments. After that watch at your own discretion. But considering you can get this box set for only 20 dollars from most sellers, it is nice that all 7 films were included. While the inclusion of the animated and live action television series would have made this set truly definitive, it still contains tremendous value for fans of 80's comedy and the series in general.",1488758400,12,2890,4.573359073359073

5967282,4,B00F40UBM8,"The Police Academy franchise was truly a 1980s hoot and at its best during the retro decade. The range of personalities provided so many memorable scenes, but the departure of Steve Guttenberg after Part 4 did take some of the fun out. Appearances from actors at the early stages of their career like Sharon Stone and Kim Cattrall confirms that these comedy films also helped unearth some big names. The 1990s were not so kind and Part 7 can only be endured out of loyalty to the other six films, but all these years later the movies are well worth watching.

5967302,5,B00F40UBM8,"The eighties had great movies but one great comedy movie that stands out  the police academy films. These films introduced us to steve guttenburg as carey mahoney and the late bubba smith as hightower and michael winslow as jones and marion ramesy as hooks , leslie easterbrook as caliahan and david graf as tackleberry and cw bailey as Lt. harris and george gayner as cmont lassard and so many others . This movie is filled with great lines and scences and moments like the ledgardy blue oyster club with biker gang totaly historical and how Lt. harris and carey mahoney are always fighting but most important how mahoney pulls pranks on harris is great. nobody better to  play jones like michael winslow he's funny and has a great talent with his voice to do sounds  like anything that comes to mind and it was legendary. the late bubba smith as hightower with his strengeth and high avantage  was awesome and sometime funny in situations. david graf as takleberry the rough tough gun  loving violent who's fearless to withhold the law was something to watch . marion ramesy as hooks she is  sweet and quite but when messed with has a voice that can shatter your ears. lesie easterbrook as caliahan the toughest women to hold a badage is to trian newbies into cops. steve guttenburg as carey mahoney who loves to be funny and be  a ladies man who makes lt. harris's life miserable as being the leader of the group of newbies. cw bailey as lt harris who wants the  newbies to all fail especially  carey mahoney as well as trian the newbies hard and swift. this film spawn seven movies but the sad note steve guttenburg only appeared in one through four but the rest were in all seven  but five through seven  were good but not better than four films with guttenburg. the blu ray transfer is great and it's region a  this is a great film that hollywood never made a remake like the others. so if you love the eighties and comedies this is for you so order it move it move it press order and get all seven on blu ray i am glad i did",1450915200,,2031,4.43010752688172

Please note only the first one is rated R (for nudity, occasional language, and implied sexual situations), the second is rated PG-13, and the rest are rated PG.",1437177600,26,576,4.162162162162162

5967322,3,B00F40UBM8,"Warner bros finally have released all 7 Police academy films on blu-ray with all new High definition transfers
but not all the qualities of this blu-ray set rate a 10/10
let me explain
when all 7 films were first released on DVD back in 2001-2004 not all 7 films had Widescreen transfers
only Police academy 1 & 2 had 1:85:1 widescreen ratios, 3,4,5,6 & 7 only had 1:33:1 fullscreen ratios
plus the picture quality was average for all 7 films and the sound quality was no better only Dolby digital stereo mixes for all the films
very lazy pathetic effort by Warner bros especially when WB couldn't make the effort to give the rest of the sequels widescreen ratios
which i thought was an insult

fast forward to 2013 when this blu-ray set was released, released ALL REGIONS despite it's U.K. release only all Discs are region free
on amazon's product details says region B, this blu-ray set is ALL REGIONS/REGION FREE
well this time around WB have made some more effort with the picture quality than they did with the old dvd versions
Police academy 1 & 2 are still the same 1:85:1 widescreen ratios
and for the first time ever now, sequels, 3,4,5,6,7 are now 1:85:1 widescreen ratios which is a celebration finally
being a big Police academy fan i've seen all the films many times
so i only watched some scenes of all 6 films just to check out the picture quality
and the picture quality is definitely a big improvement from the old dvd versions
which is what i would expect from a High definition transfer
the quality for the first Police academy looks excellent. nice shape & clear better than the old dvd version anyway
the sequel looks just as Good again nice sharp & clear transfer
and so has the 3rd, 4th, 5th & 6th sequels aswell been given the same High definition transfer
so about 8/10 for the picture quality
tragically i cannot say the same for the sound quality, very poor sound quality for all films
for a blu-ray release i expected a new 5.1 Master audio mixes for all the films, tragically not to be
just average 1.0 mono mixes for all 7 films, WB didn't even bother to add a new 5.1 master audio mix as an option
infact there are no Audio options on the menu, all the films have been fixed with Mono sound quality only
what WB should have done is add an 5.1 mix as an option in the Audio options on the menu for all the films
not have the sound quality already fixed to a mono sound
if i want mono sound quality i'll watch the VHS version
Disgusting effort 3/10 for the sound quality

as for the special features, there are no new extras at all, i thought a new Police academy legacy featurette would be Good
as an exclusive extra
but tragically as usual, WB did not bother
all they did was recycle all the old special features from the old dvd releases from years & years ago
PA1- BEHIND CLOSE DOORS retrospect featurette 30-40mins
plus the usual DVD commentary
PA2- ACCIDENTAL HEROES- retrospect featurette 8mins
PA3- ALL WASHED UP FLOATING MEMORIES- retrospect featurette 8mins
PA4- REMEMBERING LOFTY INVESTIGATION 7mins featurette
WINKS BEHIND THE SCENES home movies, stunt man Wink roberts recollects working on the police academy films
plus 14mins of Deleted scenes, some of these Deleted scenes were inserted in the film for the TV broadcast version
PA5 MISTAKE IDENTITY-CASE RE-OPENED featurette
PA 6 UNHOLY ALLIANCE featurette
about 5/10 for the extras

the packaging is just 3 standard clamshell cases, 3 Discs in 1st case, 2 discs in 2nd case, the last 2 in 3rd case
the cover art is average.
so the only thing worthwhile about this new blu-ray set is the new High Definition transfers in 1:85:1 widescreen for all 7 films
the old dvd versions of sequels 3-7 were in 1:33:1 fullscreen ratios only
the sound quality is terrible a 5.1 Master audio mix option should have been added, instead of a fixed Mono sound
the extras are recycled of course,
i would've been surprised of a new PA Legacy 30mins featurette was added for this blu-ray set
the Police academy films deserve more respect in my opinion
5 stars for the films, 2-3stars for this blu-ray set only worth $20-$30, if you pay over $30 for it you've been ripped off",1430784000,3,4150,4.575268817204301
