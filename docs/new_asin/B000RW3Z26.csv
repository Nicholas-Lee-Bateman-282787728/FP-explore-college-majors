They were better than their sequels! This collection is no different. Part 1 is better because it was elaborate, it combined story and fighting, and had a great ending! Now part 2...well this movie had many flaws: 1) it was sub-titled(but the first one wasn't), 2) in the fight scenes you could easily see the wires on the actors!, 3) the story could've been much, much better, 4) and the ending sucked! Don't get me wrong part 2 was good...but it couldn't be better than part 1. You could tell in part 2 that more money was added to the budget, having American or British actors sound Japanese but if you read their lips you could see they spoke their lines in English, and adding more special effects didn't make things look better, plus the ending could've been played out instead of in stills(they froze a scene and narrated the rest of the story!) Rent it before you buy it or buy for a good low price!",1243209600,,1068,4.538860103626943

I ordered the one that says ""Digitally Remastered"" at the top of the box but has the same basic cover as this.  No biggie cuz this one is remastered too and dubbed in English.  It also includes a ""Watch and Learn"" segment that features techniques for the Double Broadsword.  Pretty neat but nothing worth buying the disc for.  The movie, on the other hand, totally is.

On his way to a meeting of the random Manchu rebels, Chiu Jan Kwo plays a dude who helps out some other dudes from an opera troupe who are being bullied into performing for some big jerk.  He then is wounded by some Manchus posing as monks.  The opera dudes find him and take him in.  After suffering many casualties, they make their way to south Shaolin where our hero trains in additional techniques.

Not much on story, but if you like old-school, you really won't care.  This movie looks and feels quite a bit different than most from the time period.  Early 80's with mostly outdoor photography of the beautiful Chinese mainland.  The remastering job is not the best I've seen, but well beyond adequate.  Highly Recommended.

1984.  aka:  ""Red Dragons of Shaolin""",1197676800,4,1253,4.613636363636363
