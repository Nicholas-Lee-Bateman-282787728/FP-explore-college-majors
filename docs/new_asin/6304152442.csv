791098,5,6304152442,"This movie is far superior to many others in the same genre, striving for the same effect but missing by a country mile. Night Must Fall delivers all and more. Robert Montgomery is fantastic and gives one of the best performances I have ever seen on film OR stage. I have watched this film over and over, many times and each time I see some new nuance, some other subtle moment he gives to the character, and he is so on the money you wonder...how can someone be so gifted and play against type so convincingly? Rosalind Russell is marvellous, as always, and it is interesting to see her in one of her early movies. Dame May Whitty is the star of stars here, and it is astonishing that someone of her age could turn in such an agile and convincing performance, especially toward the end, when you are afraid the suspense alone will finish her off, on screen and off. The supporting cast are perfect; the maid, the cook, etc., and the suspicious policeman who turns up now and then. It is truly one of the most hair-raising climaxes ever put on film and is quite capable of holding its own agaisnt the efforts of today. I am amazed that this is a relatively unknown movie today, and it really should be publicized and put on DVD and find its niche with today's movie audience, who would, if they only were aware, appreciate the mastery so evident on every frame. Truly a masterpiece.",1057708800,80,1382,4.44488188976378
791099,4,6304152442,"If your local theatre group isn't doing NIGHT MUST FALL this efficient little movie will more than do. Emlyn Williams' original script is so canny that even reading it can give you goosebumps. John van Druten's screen treatment leaves it alone as much as possible. Dame May Whitty plays a hypochandriacal old lady; the kind who after a good night's sleep spends the next day telling everyone how she tossed & turned all night. Living with her in her house by a wood is her neice/companion Olivia (Rosalind Russell) and various servants. Enter a young page from a local hotel who may or may not be a psychopath (a chillingly effective Robert Montgomery). Williams' psychology really works on you. As unpleasant as the old lady is you don't want to see her 'get it' because Montgomery is so charming & persuasive you know in her place you'd be seduced too. It's like haveing a blind date with Ted Bundy. Whitty repeats her stage performace & she's honed it razor sharp. Rosalind Russell is awfully likeable & gives what is perhaps her most attractive performance. Montgomery, playing against type, keeps the shudders coming. For a sort of WHAT IF? version see THE NIGHT DIGGER (aka THE ROADBUILDER) with Patricia Neil & Nicholas Clay.",1028851200,17,1232,4.816037735849057
791100,4,6304152442,"A cranky old lady invalid allows herself to be charmed by a psychopath. As the North Sea gales were ""stirring aboot"", my cousins and I watched this little flick a few nights back. I must say that Montgomery played his role sincerely and his Irish accent wasn't bad---- yet the film is a just a mite stodgy and a tad too theatrical. As Danny the psychopath, Samantha Stephen's (BEWITCHED) dad was cast very against type (he practically begged Mayer for the part) but amazingly, he pulls it off magnificently (In the thirties, Robert Montgomery was primarily cast as a leading man in light, sophisticated romantic comedies opposite the likes of Crawford and Shearer). Rosalind Russell does okay as Dame May's neice but in her role of the drab repressed spinster, she was hardly in her element! Dame May obviously earned her title. As the invalid (who, in one hilarious scene, gets up out of her wheelchair a la Lucy Ricardo to fetch her box of chocolates!) her playing is quite amazing. Charmed and captivated by Danny, she is glorious when she senses impending doom when she's left all alone - one is emotionally drained just watching! In later years, the actor Richard Ney (Greer Garson married him) acted with Whitty in a picture. At one point Ney said ""alright, Dame May, but I still feel that MY way was the best way"". Whitty replied ""Young man, you haven't GOT a way!!"" This little MGM offering is a neat little thriller which I would think would definitely work better on the stage - it's too housebound, the dialogue being better suited for the stage - but it will give viewers the shivers nevertheless.",998352000,10,1609,4.709219858156028
791101,4,6304152442,"Robert Montgomery stars as the superficially charming page boy who insinuates his way into the life and home of wealthy invalid May Whitty.  Whitty isn't particularly sick, but she seems to enjoy making everyone around her miserable, especially her niece played by Rosalind Russell.  She takes a liking to Montgomery, unaware what the viewer and Russell have figured out - he's the murderer of a local woman.  I'm not giving away the ending, since it's made clear as the story progresses.  It's not the point of the film.  What this movie does want to do is take you into the mind of a murderer, and given the fact that this was made in the 1930's, it's a pretty surprising approach.  And oddly enough, it's quite suspenseful, since we wait to see what he will do next.  Montgomery is very effective as the psychopath, charm and humour masking something quite dark inside himself.  May Whitty also delivers a terrific performance as the cantankerous woman longing for the attention of a son she doesn't really have.  Russell is OK in her characterization.  Unfortunately, her character is poorly defined and her motives are often unclear, so there's something about her that doesn't add up.  The film has a number of suspenseful moments, and although it's not a completely successful portrait of a killer, I did enjoy it and think it is certainly worth watching.",997488000,9,1362,4.852813852813853

791287,2,6304152442,"""Night Must Fall"" is a re-make of the 1937 Robert Montgomery film of the Emlyn Williams play that Albert Fiinney and director Karel Reisz (""Morgan,"" ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Who'll Stop the Rain?"") produced in 1964 when Finney had wowed audiences with ""Tom Jones"" and ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" (also directed by Reisz).  Although the film is highlighted by his performance, a bit overdone, the film fails as a horror film and the suspense seems drawn merely on the aspect of delay primarily and there are no premeditated instances by scriptwriter Clive Exton (""Entertaining Mr. Sloane,"" ""Isadora"" and ""10 Rillington Place"") or director Reisz to work the audience's mind except Williams' original concept to present a psychological portrait of a killer.  Susan Hampshire (""Fighting Prince of Donegal,"" ""Three Lives of Thomasina""), Sheila Hancock (""The Moon-Spinners,"" ""Take a Girl Like You"") and Mona Washbourne (""The Collector"") all co-star and turn in great performances and help make the film watchable, but one wishes that it were spent more wisely.

791383,5,6304152442,"This was truly the break-out film in Robert Montgomery's film career.  For the most part, he had been cast as a light romantic lead throughout the early 30s. Here he plays a servant that's come looking for a job with murder on his mind. Dame May Whitty plays an elderly woman with several servants in her employment (including her niece, played by Rosalind Russell.) She lives in a charming country home where it seems nothing of any consequence could ever happen, let alone murder.  I love watching Montgomery's mannerisms throughout the film as he weedles his way into the old woman's confidence.  I don't want to give the ending away, but it is rather chilling and I don't like to watch the movie alone at night (even though you really never see anything happen).

 May Witty usually played more benign characters and it is a revelation of a much greater range. Montgomery is a touch old to be alled a boy, but in thosedays if Norma Sheaer could play 14, why not Robert Montgomery playing seventeen.

Darling Roz shows another aspect of her ability, a long way from ""His Girl Friday"".

791520,5,6304152442,"I came across the play from many different angles. It was mentioned in other programs and film criticisms. Then when I found the script ""Night Must Fall : a Play in Three Acts [Kindle Edition]"" and saw that there was a 1937 film version with Dame May Whitty, Rosalind Russell, and Robert Montgomery. I was mesmerized into buying a copy.

I knew the play but had to see how it played out in this remastered film. I was not disappointed. Now people that are more interested discovering for their selves who-dun-it will be disappointed as the play is more of a psychological thriller and more interested in people's reactions to each other. You may find the movie to be more rounded than the play but very close.

It was well acted and well paced; as you get sucked into the story you forget that it is just a play and you find yourself kibitzing.

The basic story is that a woman went missing from a nearby hotel. Naturally people suspect foul play. A suspicious worker from the hotel now comes to worm his way into the good graces of a rich widow. We know who everyone suspects (probably a red herring.) My money is on the lawyer as you know how they are. But watch and decide for yourself.

After you are finished watching it for the first time watch again and see what you missed while speculation on who-dun-it. Usually in these old movies it is the butler.

791528,4,6304152442,"After seeing ""Silence of the Lambs"" I was struck by the similarities between the gutsy Jodie Foster character and the repressed but sharp-eyed niece in ""Night Must Fall"", played by Rosalind Russell. While the 1930's film can't compare in terms of realism, the two films feature spunky heroines who try to confront and outwit the suave, sexy villain who attempts to read their minds. While Robert Montgomery is no Anthony Hopkins, he possesses a snake-like charm that convinces you that yes, a house full of lonely women (except for the hard-headed cook) would fall instantly under his spell. The scenes in which he insinuates that Russell has a secret lust for him and tries to get her to openly admit it are the most tense in the film.

This is Montgomery's tour de force, and he won an Best Actor nomination for the role. Unfortunately, the film itself has not dated well. It suffers from a Hays Code-imposed ending (in the Emlyn Williams play, Olivia never repents of her passion for Danny and it is Danny who admits his guilt, refusing to be indebted to a woman) and the fact that the film embraces a kind of dime-store psychology that was popular in the 1930s but feels very fake and false now.

In addition, the film lacks the fluid camera movement one would expect in a thriller and plays more like a drawing room comedy with the intimations of murder sprinkled here and there. Until the end, all of Danny's crimes are hinted at and there are hardly any visuals at all, which would try a modern audience's patience. Director Richard Thorpe clearly had no experience directing thrillers, and one can only dream what kind of film Alfred Hitchcock would have made with it!

Despite these limitations, ""Night Must Fall"" is an entertaining film to watch, if only for the way it broke new ground in allowing a handsome leading man (Montgomery) take on such an unappetizing role that 1930s Hollywood usually gave to somebody like Boris Karloff.",1358985600,2,1944,4.745562130177515

791600,5,6304152442,"This is an often forgotten film that pops up occasionally on TCM in the morning. It is one of my favorite thrillers from MGM from back in the day when MGM ruled Hollywood with 'more stars than they have in the heavens' or something to that effect.
It falls into a category of extreme thrillers of the era which also includes The Red House, The Two Mrs. Carrolls, The Night of the Hunter, and Cape Fear where psychotic leads rule the roost.
Based on a stage play but well translated for film, it is a cat and mouse game about an amoral psychotic killer named Danny. Played with a lot of amiable charm by pretty boy/ faux leading man Robert Montgomery, in a lot of ways it really showcased Montgomery's wide range of emotions and was the perfect vehicle for him to show off. As Danny, he is charming, endearing,affable, cuddly, insidious, threatening, and all out psycho terrifying. He paces his performance to a point of odd perfection as he can shift his character's emotions in a micro second with perfect physical expression.
While it is really Montgomery's show, Rosalind Russell comes across in that unique way she is known for. She is intelligent, skeptical, questioning, increasingly suspicicious, and panicky as she starts processing just how dangerous Danny is.
Dame May Whitty supports all this as a potential victim as she is cajoled by Danny in his court jester persona being led like a lamb to the slaughter.

791604,5,6304152442,"Robert Montgomery, best known for his work in romantic comedies, manages to be both creepy and sexy in Emlyn Williams' classic work (adapted for the screen by  John Van Druten) about a charming serial killer who keeps something not-very-nice in a hat box. When he charms his way into obtaining a servant position in the secluded house of an elderly invalid, the old lady's niece, beautifully played by Rosalind Russell, refuses to succumb to his charms but not without a great deal of effort. The problem is that she suspects he's a killer and is still irresistibly drawn to him. In short, Mr. Montgomery becomes the ultimate ""bad boy"" and with a Welsh accent, no less.

791605,5,6304152442,"This became one of my top 10 favorite movies when I first saw it about 5 years ago on TCM. I've always been a Bob Montgomery fan, but it's an unusual role for him- and he runs away with the movie. All through the film are unpleasant, very human emotional undercurrents- the treatment of Olivia by Mrs. Bramson, worsened by the speed and depth of Danny's beguiling of the old lady; Danny's brush-off of poor Dora, the simple-minded little maid he's gotten 'into trouble'; the excitement of the tour members who come to gawk at the scene of the 'grisly' discovery; Olivia's attraction to Danny despite her revulsion. Danny is such a perfect con-man, Olivia sees it yet is barely able to keep herself from falling under his spell as well. The characters are endlessly entertaining. The smart-alecky cook (""put that in your needles and knit it""), confused, repressed Olivia who is humiliated and persecuted by her aunt, and Danny, an undeniably attractive, smooth sociopath.( I completely agree with another reviewer: Olivia's attraction to Danny, in a remake, would be more than hinted at- the producers would feel they needed to explain it through graphic dream sequences, fantasies, etc.) And it all takes place in picturesque, charming surroundings that are wonderfully recreated--or was this filmed in the English countryside? Hard to tell!-- I wish I could have seen May Whitty do this role onstage. Truly atmospheric and creepy, more so because of what isn't seen. Have it on the DVR, but please Turner, or MGM, PLEASE release on DVD!!",1294099200,,1538,4.942084942084942
791606,5,6304152442,"I recorded this movie on my DVR from Turner Classic Movies channel. It's one of those movies that gets better with each viewing. I like lots of dialogue since I usually view (or listen to) TV/movies while I do needlework, so it's nice to listen to what's going on and glance at the TV occasionally.

I love Dame May Whitty because her character was such a horrible old biddy. What a great actress! I'll bet that was a fun role for her to play. I think she was the best part of the movie. Robert Montgomery gave me goosebumps because he was always so calm and charming, yet a monster. He was a good actor as well. Rosalind Russell's acting was sort of flat in this movie, and her character was a moron anyway. She was attracted to Danny (Robert Montgomery) knowing full well he had murdered and decapitated a lady and had the victim's head in a hatbox in their house!

791669,5,6304152442,"Watched this on a cable station, and I was very impressed. If I had more hands, I would give this film 10 thumbs up. I kept checking to see who the director was, because this seemed like a Hitchcock movie, in it's suspenseful elements, disturbed and disturbing characters and interactions. Another Hitchcock element is the use of working class characters to produce humorous, insightful commentary on the goings-on in the film. Here the humour comes from two maids who comment on the goings on in the house. The Rosalind Russell character seems to step out of the film noir era. She is not the normal heroine of the murder mysteries of that time. She finds herself drawn to a psychopath who has wormed his way into the employ of her mean spirited aunt. There is some sexual attraction on her part, which is touched on, but in a very subtle manner. I am sure if they remade this film today, it would emphasize the sexual nature of her attraction to this killer, which would reduce this important element of the film to pandering to pruient interests. Instead, the film just hints at it, and it isn't till the middle half of the film that you realize what is happening. This is the advantage that earlier films have over modern ones. Bizarre desires, thoughts, and actions are merely hinted at. In modern films, through imagery, actions, and music, they tend to promote the most disturbing images they can come up with to show a character's or a civilization's moral rot; and this is considered avant garde and edgy. I say it's laziness. It's a lot harder to show a disturbed character by using innuendo and subtlety than it it is to splash it all over the screen so that the filmaker is sure you get the point. A great example of using subtlety to show disturbed characters is in the film ""The Innocents."" Nothing is ever shown or even explained very clearly, yet you know that something dreadful has happened to the children in the film.",1235952000,5,1937,4.6173913043478265
791670,5,6304152442,"I was not a big Robert Montgomery fan in spite of my love for old movies - UNTIL I saw this film on Turner Classic Movies about 3 years ago.  After seeing him in tux and tails being an idle rich socialite in a dozen movies, Mr. Montgomery really showed his range of talent here.  He was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for this role.  With his charisma and bad-boy good looks, he makes Ted Bundy look like Winnie The Pooh!  His hip-hop swagger and confidence made it irresistible for Rosalind Russell to want a bit of ""thug love"" in her previously uneventful existence. Montgomery's ""Danny"" showed up that you can never let your guard down because even the nicest next door neighbor can be a homicidal maniac.  Dame May Whitty got caught up because she was a despicable old lady who thought she was pimping everyone with her invalid act.  But, in this case, game recognized game and she got taken in worse than Russell and the two housekeepers.  With no blood and gore (although it is hinted at it with the hat case that Danny carried around as a ""trophy"" like most such killers), this was one of the most psychologically scary flicks that  I've ever seen.  And I have never missed one showing on TCM since 2005.  It's always on the bill when the show honors Montgomery, Russell, or Whitty.  I put this film at the top of my all-time favorites but I refuse to buy it on VHS.  It deserves a DVD digitally restored ""Special Edition"" and I would buy it at any price to add to my DVD collection of old classics.  I could just get it on VHS and convert it to DVD but you lose so much definition like that.  I just hope, when it does make it to DVD, the film company doesn't screw it up by ""colorizing"" it.

791675,5,6304152442,"""Night Must Fall"" is the type of movie that's great to own because you'll watch it a hundred times--it is a ""chicken soup"" type movie which has that intangible something which holds up under repeated viewings without getting tiresome. Perhaps because--as in other ""cult"" movies like ""The Bad Seed"", ""Streetcar Named Desire"", ""Suddenly Last Summer"" and ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane""--it is a wee bit perverse. Ostensibly a rather conventional ""whodunnit"", ""Night"" surprises the viewer by introducing what must have been in 1937 a radical element--the fascination and attraction that Olivia (Rosalind Russel) feels for a cold blooded murderer (Robert Montgomery). Why is she fascinated and attacted to him? Because she's bored with her repressed existence in an isolated house with her bossy aunt, that's why!  Danny's very dangerousness, although lethal, is apparently just the jolt Olivia needs to feel alive again, and she's not ready to give it up right away! So she elects to shield him so that he won't be found out. Because this plot twist was unprecedented then (and scarce in films even today), you'll have a great time watching to see how it all works out. As some reviewers have noted, ""Night Must Fall"" is a bit stagey but as with ""The Bad Seed"", I don't think this hurts it one bit. Like ""Seed"", it WAS a stageplay  (in 1935) and featured many of the same players before being filmed by MGM (interestingly, the play's author Emlyn Williams himself played the role of Danny). It could be said that Russell seems rather wooden in her role as the repressed niece, but this appears to be the way the character is written, as a woman who is emotionally stunted. It's hard to believe, watching her, that this is only two years before ""The Women"" and three years before ""His Girl Friday"". As good as she is however, she finishes third to Dame May Whitty as crochety old Mrs Bramson and Robert Montgomery as Danny, the charming murderer! Dame Whitty devours the scenery with such finesse, and Montgomery is so subtley full of lurking menace (one thinks of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector watching him), that poor Rosalind doesn't stand a chance against them! She got her chance in only a few years however. ""Night Must Fall"" has it all--humor and suspense in equal parts.",1139097600,15,2280,4.873711340206185
791676,5,6304152442,"I just saw this little gem for the first time a few nights ago on

TCM. It had been recommended to me by a fellow ""old movies"" maven.

Initially,I thought perhaps Mr. Montgomery wasn't exactly ""up"" to the task of playing the creepy,fawning lead,but I was wrong. His creepiness built up slowly until the sound of his smarminess made me cringe. So he did his part. Rosiland Russell played against type in this role. We are used to seeing her as a strong,witty,take-no-prisoners  woman. Here,however,she does an excellent turn as a plain-Jane,timid and unsure of herself around Montgomery's character. Or anyone else's,for that matter. I think she handled her role very well. Perhaps we,who are huge fans  of hers,will forever see her as ""Auntie Mame,"" a role she was born to play. Forget Auntie Mame for a moment, and enjoy one of Russell's early works. The servants are played very well by British actresses whom we have seen in many,many movies. They are wonderful. Now,after all of this praise,I have to tell you that I think Dame May Whitty is the one who not only stole the movie,but she is the one who certainly must have knocked everyone's socks off when this first came out. She plays a really unlikeable old bat,but as another reviewer said here,we really don't want to see her knocked off. My favorite part of the movie is when she gets panicky,screaming and ranting and carrying on. She let herself go off the deep-end,in a very enjoyable,albeit somewhat cringe-inducing manner that was delicious!

It must have been fun for her to let her hair down for this role.

So..check it out if  you are partial to this type of old movie. No blood. No guts. At least not on screen! Just a solid,somewhat creepy movie,inhabited by some very fine actors.",1136332800,4,1752,4.743421052631579
791677,3,6304152442,"""Night Must Fall"" an offbeat murder thriller set in the English countryside had potential to be intriguing but was plagued by uneven acting performances.

Robert Montgomery does fairly well tackling a role that was different from those he had previously played to this point in his career.  Playing the psychopathic hotel page Danny, he shows up at the house of the wealthy old and cantankerous Mrs. Bramson simultaneous to a police investigation of a local woman's disappearance.  Under the guise of courting the old woman's maid, he immediately ingratiates himself to the aged gal played marvelously by septagenarian Dame May Witty.  She hires him to work in the house and be her companion much to the consternation of her niece and caretaker Olivia.  Olivia played is an amazingly wooden performance by Rosalind Russell is strangely attracted by Montgomery but is fearful of his diabolical nature.

Montgomery while getting on Witty's good side is suspicious.  We are fed clues by director Richard Thorpe to give us insight into the devious nature of Montgomery's personality.  The audience along with Russell are led to believe that he was responsible for the missing woman whose headless corpse is found just feet away from Dame Witty's property.  The two faced Montgomery has something else up his sleeve but we have to wait until the climax to learn what that will be.",1133913600,4,1375,5.048672566371682

The attraction (and for me it was a great one) of this film is in the superb acting by Robert Montgomery and Rosalind Russell.  Dame May Whitty was of course good too--but she was acting very much in type here, so no surprise.  But as for Montgomery and Russell . . .

The actress Betsy Palmer, reflecting on Joan Crawford, said something like ""Actors should never be parents.  They live in a very strange world.""

Perhaps.  For if you've ever seen Robert Montgomery in any other movie, you'll not believe it's really him in this one.  He's incredible.  His facial expressions, his outcries, his soft Irish brogue--I felt like I was in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the original), crying to anyone who'd listen, ""Yes, he looks exactly like Robert Montgomery--but IT'S NOT HIM!!!""  That's what a really great actor can achieve, and Montgomery (yes, it IS him, but you won't notice, or care that it's him) achieves it superbly.

As for Rosalind Russell playing a demure, almost mousy young woman--skip ahead a mere two years from this film to 1939 and watch her as the fast-talking uber-catty gal in ""The Women.""  Skip ahead a couple of more years to an even faster-talking gal in ""His Girl Friday.""  Finally skip ahead to 1958 and watch her as ""Auntie Mame.""  And then, watch her in ""Night Must Fall,""  Maybe you'll cry out, as I did again, ""Yes, she looks exactly like Rosalind Russell--but IT'S NOT HER!!!""  But here too, yes it IS her, and you won't notice, or care that it's her.

As for these two living in a strange world in real life, I doubt that applies.  Montgomery was, after all, the dad of the wonderful Elizabeth Montgomery.  And Russell's only child seemed to have turned out pretty well too.  Plus, Russell gave endlessly of herself to good causes.  Let's just say Joan Crawford lived in a strange world.

7862734,1,6304152442,"This is a review for the original 1937 film. I bought this film because it seemed a lot like The Spiral Staircase with Dorothy McGuire, which I loved.  I thought I would like this but that was not the case. I hate movies where the main character does really dumb things and we have that in abundance here with Olivia, Rosalind Russell's character. She has a bad feeling about Danny from the moment he arrives just after the disappearance of the woman. The police come to investigate to see if anyone at the house knows anything. Shortly after, Olivia even catches Danny in a few lies but does she go back to the police and say, ""Hey I don't have a good feeling about this guy, can you check him out?"" No... Instead, she and the other two servants go into his room to snoop around his things. However, no one has the sense to watch out for him coming back to the house. Duh!

Then, after the headless corpse is found right near their house Olivia runs out of the house in fear to go see her boyfriend Justin, a good looking lawyer who loves her and wants to marry her. (But our heroine chooses instead, to live with her nasty old aunt who berates her constantly. (Duh #2) Now you might think this would be the perfect time to tell someone she trusts about her gut feeling regarding Danny, but you'd be wrong. Instead, in response to Justin's questions about Danny, she replies inexplicably and against her instincts: ""Oh yes, he's alright! Of course! ...Yes, I'd better get back now darling, everything will be alright!""  (Duh #3...)

Next, the police inspector comes to question Danny and begins searching his room. Then, just as the Inspector is about to ask what's in the mysterious hat box and why it's locked, our brainy protagonist inexplicably rescues this dolt who she hates by saying, ""Oh, that's mine. Danny's room used to be the box room."" Duh #4...(Huh?? I actually screamed at the screen. She seemed to have this strange, annoying desire to confront him on her own.)

Finally, Olivia does leave the house (but at night, of course). Duh #5.

That's just too many Duhs for one movie. If you're looking for a good old thriller, in my opinion, The Spiral Staircase is much better than this one.  Plus, the sound wasn't that great and there were no subtitles.",1495065600,,2266,4.53921568627451

7862740,5,6304152442,"Are there really two killers at work in this play? The one might be the charming psychopath whom we all likely suspect from the beginning  the other is a more subtle killer who works by allowance and default. In some ways the latter is the more dangerous because this sort of killer cannot be charged  cannot even be blamed. In most cases, this sort of killer isn't even realized. Yet this second individual achieves the goal of eliminating a troublesome person while still keeping clean hands.

Im not sure if this tacit conspiracy is what Emlyn Williams intended when he wrote the play on which this is based. But the way a certain line is delivered towards its end does tend to give the drama that depth and level of complexity.

Williams was quite interested in the psychology of killers. He attended every day of the trial of child killer Myra Hindley. Although the crimes Hindley committed in conjunction with her partner Ian Brady took place decades after Night Must Fall was written  there is a certain subtle parallel of predatory psychology at work in the two crimes  the one fictional, the other real. Williams was prescient in dramatizing how two people might have congruent goals and recognize each other, and themselves, in the course of their interaction. Whether this extra layer of homicidal intent actually exists, or whether Im imputing too much to a certain turn towards the plays end  either way, the play has a dangerous undertow.

I keep calling this movie a play because thats how it looks. It looks as if it could have been a filmed version of an actual stage performance. In most cases, applying the adjective stagey to a movie carries a negative connotation. But in this case, the sense of proscenium and wings works.  A psychological thriller is enhanced by conveying a live-action sense, a sense in which you, the viewer, is boxed in a dark room with the menace.

Theres also the unsettling aspect of the casting for Night. Both Robert Montgomery and Rosalind Russell do a good job of playing against type here. Since were used to seeing them in lighter comedic contexts, we are put a bit off-balance from the start by their appearance in this darker frame. Not that there aren't some exchanges of sly, humorous insinuation in the dialogue.
