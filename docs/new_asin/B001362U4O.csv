8249261,5,B001362U4O,"A classic of WWII. A very accurate retelling of history. Sometimes disturbing and sometimes glorious, it became an instant classic in our family, especially to my Dad, who had been there. The casting is excellent, especially Patrick Duffy as Paul Tibbets. He is very believable as a commander with the weight of the world on his shoulders and the inability to talk to anyone about it, especially his wife, played well by Kim Darby. Now, if only someone would make a DVD of it.",1348617600,,476,4.678571428571429
8249262,5,B001362U4O,"This is a first rate, well acted well produced movie. It tells the story of the Crew of the 509th who flew the Enola Gay; the one that dropped the first Atomic Bomb. Patrick Duffy does a splendid job portraying COL Paul Tippets, the pilot and crew leader. You will also see Billy Crystal as the Communications Officer and several other familiar faces. If you are a WWII buff or just like really good war movies, this is the one to watch. It is not about morality, although the subject comes up as it did in real life, in the White House. Actual footage is shown of the blast and the aftermath (along with some well thought narrative).  My ONLY regret is that this has not made it to DVD.",1254009600,2,687,4.2846153846153845
