8056650,1,B000929VKY,"I am sorry to say this documentary epic is not worth viewing. It's amazing how boring a program such fascinating subject can make. The lady writer who hosts the program, walks around endlessly and pointlessly (often in slow motion), gazes into the heavens, lays out tarot cards wherever she has the possibility - and she has many. After 30 minutes or so her close-ups and limited acting ability reaches a critical level and the viewer is compelled to push the button. This is one woman's journey, and if she enojoyed it half as much as we enjoy watching it, then she enjoyed it twice as much.",1131235200,10,592,4.59433962264151
