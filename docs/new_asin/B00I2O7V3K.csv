8638370,2,B00I2O7V3K,"The only good episode on here was ""Avatar"" where Teal'c gets stuck in a sort of ""Matrix""-like computer simulation where if he dies there, he dies in real life. But even that episode was a rip-off of ""The Matrix"". The other episodes had lousy plots and way too much drama. This was the worst volume in Season 8. The other volumes were pretty good, but this one sucked.
