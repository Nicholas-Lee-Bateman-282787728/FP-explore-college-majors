8450721,5,B00505E4Q6,"As mentioned earlier, this story includes historical background, most of which I already know but it's accurate and informative to those who do not know how the P-51 came into existence and its evolution. Still,  this DVD featured a lot of in-flight video , escort and gun camera clips.

Appreciated seeing some new photo segments in spite of my collection on the Mustang and warbirds in general. The Brits were instrumental in getting their Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 into the production P-51, and made the airplane famous; this was covered well.

DVD draws comparisons to the Mustang's opponents, the German ME-109s and FW-190s, and with our own P47 Thunderbolt and P38 Lightning. It all adds to understanding where the Mustang stood in relation to other WW2 fighters... on top.

Covers European and Pacific combat theaters nicely, and even some little known service in Italy and Philippines.",1470960000,,890,5.117241379310345
