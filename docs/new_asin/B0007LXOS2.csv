8048637,1,B0007LXOS2,"Its a rip-off.  It contains the same episodes as ""The Adventure Begins"" 1 - 6.  I thought it was another episode in addition to 1 - 6. Kind of like buying two different albums, both of which contain the same songs.  Rip-off",1198713600,,223,4.261904761904762
8048638,4,B0007LXOS2,"The first of the two animated installments of the Redwall series has the same trait as the book: it takes a while to establish the style of the setting. Anyone who has read the entire series knows that Redwall has many inconsistancies with the rest of them. The show is no different; in fact the second storyline, based on Mattimeo, is much more faithful to the book.

  The many omitted details from Redwall are obvious, but they're mostly the darker ones. And yes, some of the slayings are present, but I didn't see graphic blood flying across the screen, just shadows. And did anyone see bits of Cluny go flying as the bell crushed him? Didn't think so. As for the two added characters, why not? They give a bit extra to the plot, and don't clash with the setting or story at all.

  The only thing I objected to was the one use of the word 'damn' in toward the beginning of the show. This may be part of the reason PBS pulled it. Another thing could have been the complexities of the story. It's a young adult novel at heart, not PBS's usual daytime audience.

  This series is quite enjoyable, and like all first efforts, has some rough spots. Nonetheless, I recommend it.

  By the by, it's not good form to criticise a person's voice, doncha know? Impertinent thing to do, wot wot?",1136851200,11,1288,4.43404255319149
8048639,1,B0007LXOS2,"Black and White. Where's the color shown on the jacket? Poor quality reproduction, even to the point of seeing the white area above the reel. How do I get a refund?",1130976000,3,164,4.32258064516129
8048640,4,B0007LXOS2,"This is the first volume of 2 it contains first four episode from the redwall cartoon show that was briefly on PBS was discontinued for reason unknow to me. Unfortunaetly this version has been dicontinue there are few volumes left for about 6 to 30 dollars used. Your best bet is to get the special edition version this contain both disk that make up the whole first season. It is a good retelling of the original novel. How ever several changes and alterations were made just warning you for those who were dispointed by Eragon movie from 2005. Some of the events have been modified and there order changed. Some new ones have been add probably to stall since about 2/3 of the books original dialogue was either altered or cut coupletly out. There are also three new characters weren't in the original book a knife thrower and a spice trader and mathisis Sister who very briefly appears in a flash back at the begining.
I loved the cartoon show there are some jeers with it. The reasons why it's only gave it a 4 because some of the good parts from the book like the murder of Scrag were not shown.  The other reason why it's only a four because several parts of the part were heavely censored or rewritten. Due to PBS be so strict on cencorship. Some parts censored  were the crashing of cluny cart the murder of Sella, the attack on Chicken hound by Asmodous and the aftermath of the struggle between Mathisas and king Bull Sparrow cluny falling from the tree were censored.
In the original book  some of Cluny soliders died in the wagon wreck.
Also in the original storey when king bull sparrows attacks Mathisis the fight is so violent that his beak snapped of his flesh and half of it gets stuck in mathisis soulder the have to pull it out with a probe.

 Surprisingly three of the most violently parts in the book the slaying of Asmodous, Cluny and Cheesetheif were not censored because there were no gory effect with them.
Asmodous you see behead. Cluny you she crushed by the Joeseph Bell. Cheestief is assinated by Constance but it is done deliberately because cheesthief is not loyal to Cluny like in the original novel Cluny spy alterd him to the assination attempt in advance.
Another part that was censored I considerone of the most intense scene in the book when Mathisis meets captain snow. The bones of his previous meals are not shown. There was another scene was censored when mathisas falls from the rafters into Siquire Julian mouth.  In the original book he panks and screams like a sissy girl. This is a good first season.  But if you want to hear the storey in it's original uncesored form buy the redwall unabridge ten disc collection or the paper back book.  You can get the audio book one Amazom for about 25 or  30 dollars.  I don't recommend this unless you are super patient for it take a long time about 12 to 13 hours listen to one redwall storey unabriged on cd or casete once. If you want to get the other 9 episode buy Redwall Friend and foes dvd used.",1130198400,8,2987,4.484346224677717
8048641,2,B0007LXOS2,"I have read the book of Redwall many times and when i saw the movie my first thought was 'oh god they've gone and slaughtered the book' but i decided to give it a try anyway, and boy was i right.  things are swiched around, people who die in the book don't, they miss whole chunks and they skip out on all the big battles but the one thing i thought they got right was Basil Stag Hair.  but though Basil is the commic relief they completly down played him.  they do have many of the lines from the book but besides the battles one part i really missed from the book was when Basil had the rats chasing him and he was frolicking around them pelting them with dasies.  i was so dissapointed with the way they made this.  it makes Matthias seem alot stupider and less like the hero he is in the book. it also has cornflower dissing matthias.  whats up with that?  AND WHEN DOES CORNFLOWER HELP WITH THE SEARCH FOR THE TOMB AND THE SWORD!?  to any who have read and liked the book i would not recomend this at all.  it distorts the plot and adds background not mentioned in the book which makes no sence because who ever said anything about matthias wanting revenge in the book?  Oh and its in episodes.  the first disk has only the first four episodes which gets you to just after King Bull sparra trys to kill Matthias, he wakes up and it pretty much ends after that.  To those who have read the book we all know that the Father Abbot agreed to defend the abby but not attack, but in the movie thing he is completly against any combat.  its like he dosent care if people die. and no one really even cares about matthias, they all ignore him untill he does something dangerous or stupid.  all in all it was a big dissapointment and to any redwall fans don't watch this, it will depress you.",1126483200,15,1787,4.202346041055718
8048642,3,B0007LXOS2,"Good video quality, but note that this dvd contains only the first 4 episodes of Matthias's story arc, stopping at his fight with the Sparrow King. Would have been great to have all of the story arc released at the same time.",1122681600,,225,4.380952380952381
8048643,3,B0007LXOS2,"I was a bit dissapointed in the animation when I rented this- but it's alright! It give's a back-story on Matthias's past before he came to Redwall Abbey. They jumble around the plot a bit, but overall it's alright.",1120694400,4,215,4.538461538461538
8048644,2,B0007LXOS2,"I've read redwall 5 times went over every detail and well this sucks it add things that should be left left out important details and worst of all got a twrrible basil stag hare voice! He in my opinion was the best book charactor,but they ruined him here in this. I am refering to the tv version i pray for the dvd release that they atleast recast basil stg hare. P.S. In case anyone wants to know all my classmates and friends who saw it (about 20-25 people) thought I, Ian William Anderson, did a much better job at basil's voice "" Eh! Wot!""",1117497600,8,543,4.230769230769231
