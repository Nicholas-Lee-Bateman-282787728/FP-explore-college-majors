I just got this a couple of days ago and it was better than i thought it would be. I learned alot about the series and some of the stuff i just couldn't help but laugh. If your a fan of the series this is a must see.",1153612800,4,411,3.7790697674418605
2560284,5,B000FC2GA0,A majority of the contents and interviews for this commemorative DVD were filmed at the 25th anniversary get-together in 2003 of all of the actors from the various Halloween movies since 1978 -- meaning the bulk was recorded in 2003 - 25 years after the release of Halloween.,1153440000,9,275,4.75
2560285,4,B000FC2GA0,"Perhaps anchor bay rereleased it's horrific masterpiece two years too early for an anniversary spectacular edition, but Halloween still remains the holy grail of all slasher films. When the immortal killer Michael first donned his rubber mask in 1978, fear sparked across the globe at this nail biting, edge of your seat thriller, catapulting audience members into a state of pure, exiliharating suspense. The film, with it's perfect cult status, was later followed with a grueling number of deficient sequels, each copying and belittling it's predeccesor until audience members shifted their attentions to other characters in the same macabre genre. The original Halloween continues to be the grandest horror movie of the past millinium, backed excellently in this special edition dvd by a slew of delicious bonus features. So gather your loved ones in October, cozy around the television, and scare yourself silly with this piece of hair raising entertainment.",1153353600,2,962,5.42

If you don't mind spending 70 bucks you can get all 8 films in a Japanese box set on Ebay ""all films are in English"" Anchor Bay only gave the rights to Japan and Europe.

2560287,4,B000FC2GA0,"What I do know is this:

1. It's not another special edition of the movie, ""Halloween"".

2. The dvd will contain a documentary revolving around the entire series.

3. The reason why this is going to be released is due to the fact that a new Halloween movie is in the process of being made. The film is supposed to be directed by Rob Zombie. The director says he wants to get a fresh start and revolve around the character of Michael Myers, instead of portraying him as the faceless killer.

NOTE****

I've yet to see the actual documentary. This review is for the sole purpose of helping you understand the content and reasoning of this DVD.

2560294,4,B000FC2GA0,"25 Years of Terror is one of the better horror documentaries. It's not as good as Never Sleep Again or Crystal Lake Memories but most Halloween fans will like it. It does critically examine the first eight Halloween films. The Rob Zombie remakes hadn't been made when this documentary was released. There is a lot of footage from fan conventions but not as much coverage on the films themselves. This doc could use a good edit now but it does have many interesting moments and even apologies. Many of the sequels take a lot of heat. That is mostly fair but Halloween III deserves better treatment. This 2006 documentary is somewhat dated now but Halloween gets much better treatment then many other horror franchises. There could always be more and it would be great to hear from John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis again.

Special Features: ""Horror's Hallowed Ground"" featurette, ""Fans of Halloween"" featurette, Halloween II and Halloween III extended interviews, Extended celebrity interviews, Halloween 5 On-Set Footage, Halloween Convention Montage, Halloween panel discussion, Halloween II panel discussion, Halloween 6 panel discussion, Ellie Cornell panel discussion, Dean Cundey panel discussion, Halloween producers panel discussion, Halloween location still gallery, Halloween Convention Behind-The-Scenes gallery, Original artwork gallery, Exclusive comic book inspired by the series

The plastic around the item was very wrinkled and torn so I used an older dvd case I had lying around so not a big deal, but wish they would keep this in mind for the next customer who buys this product.

2560297,5,B000FC2GA0,"This is a pretty good documentary I was able to purchase long before I was old enough to watch any of the movies. It's good but it's far from perfect (as it says in the title). Most of the Special Editions to some of these movies go more in depth than they go in this documentary. For example HALLOWEEN III. They only talk like 5, 6 or 7 minutes about it. The most they go in depth on (other than the first one), the 6th and 7th ones are the ones. The 6th one talks mainly about the dis-interest that director Joe Chappelle had over the making of the film. The 7th movie they focus more on the controversy over the constantly changing masks. I'll just say this: buy this documentary but also buy the Anchor Bay 2 Disc Special Edition of the 1978 original, the Scream! Factory DVD or Blu-Ray to HALLOWEEN II and HALLOWEEN III, the Anchor Bay Divi Max Special Editions to HALLOWEEN 4 and HALLOWEEN 5 and the original DVD releases to HALLOWEEN: H2O and HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION. P.S. These don't go in depth on the Rob Zombie remakes, even though he gets interviewed. Also, check out Disc 2 for some very cool Q & A Panels (the best one with the Michael Myers performers. It's hilarious). Here's the list of interviewed participants:

2560299,4,B000FC2GA0,"The Dvd included a lot of interesting stuff but since it is 10 years old obviously some things have changed (especially when they talk about a Halloween 9), but overall it was entertaining and informative.  I'm a huge fan so I really hope they do something for the 35th or 40th aniverseries.",1366848000,,291,4.596153846153846
2560300,4,B000FC2GA0,"This is a two disc set which contains a documentary chronicling the movies through Halloween 8 and then shows panel discussions with the cast and crew of the various films.  What I like is that they touch on the good points and the low points of the series (see Halloween 3, 6 and 8).  It talks about some of the fighting that went on between directors and producers, John Carpenter bowing out of having anything to do with the series for a while, and most interesting the story behind what exactly happened to make Halloween 6 such a mess.

If you cannot stand to hear anything negative about the series, then this is not for you.  Likewise if you have no interest in the movies beyond the first one this will probably not appeal to you either.  But if you are a fan of the series and of the characters as a whole, this will be an entertaining look at its origin and development.  Well worth adding to your collection.",1362787200,,919,4.376470588235295

The original Halloween started the modern craze of the slasher flick and was obviously a heavy influence on the makers of the Friday the 13th film series. It was great to take a look back at the film's history via stories from the cast members, writers, producers and directors of the various Halloween films. This was a great little gem for fans of the Halloween franchise.",1361318400,,438,4.4875

2560305,1,B000FC2GA0,"HALLOWEEN: 25 YEARS OF TERROR bills itself as a documentary made by the fans, for the fans. This much seems true, until it becomes apparent that several of the people being interviewed having mostly negative things to say about any one film from the Halloween franchise. This would be bad enough, but these same people are no-name, sexist fools who criticize the movies and praise nudity. Their opinions are less than worthless, if that is even possible. While it's nice to see some of the cast members from various films talking about their experiences during and after their time with the franchise, the main documentary has a simple and insulting message: ""The first film is a perfect classic, and the rest suck."" The director(s) even repeatedly show footage of Moustapha Akkad apologizing for the various sequels. I find this to be unfair and outright wrong.

In short, if you live the Halloween films, this documentary will only insult you to the point that you want a refund.

PS - The bonus comic is also little more than a cheap rag better suited for a certain use following a bowel movement.",1314576000,4,1100,4.78421052631579
2560306,5,B000FC2GA0,"This two-DVD set was released in 2006 and contains documentaries about the entire Halloween series of movies, from the first Halloween (1978) through Halloween Resurrection (2002).  On this set you'll get to see and hear the cast and crew from all the movies discuss their experiences making the Halloween movies they were involved in.  They tell interesting and sometimes funny stories.  There are a total of 80 interviews.  Some of the people interviewed are John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Moustapha Akkad, Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis, Tom Atkins, Danielle Harris, Joseph Wolf, Nick Castle, Dean Cundey, Tommy Lee Wallace, Rick Rosenthal, Ellie Cornell, Alan Howarth, Garn Stephens, Brad Schacter, Gloria Gifford, Marianne Hagan, Pamela Susan Shoop, and many more.  Fans of the franchise, such as Rob Zombie, also are interviewed.

One of the features is a tour of the Halloween series filming locations, such as the Meyers house, the Wallace house, etc.  PJ Soles, who plays Linda in the original Halloween, narrates a feature on the history of the franchise.  Her narration is smooth in delivery and honest in content.  She also appears on screen many times, including during the feature about revisiting the filming locations 25 years later.

Also included are extended interviews with cast and crew from Halloween II and Halloween III, as well as Halloween V on-set footage, footage from Halloween conventions, and collections of props and memorabilia.  You'll also get to see a panel discussion with many of the guys who played Michael Myers in the various movies, not to mention lots of other panel discussions involving cast and crew members.  Also included are stills galleries and an original artwork gallery.

Some segments have occasional swearing in them, such as the comments made by a movie critic and Rob Zombie.  I just thought I'd warn you about that in case you're looking for a totally ""clean"" swear word-free set of documentaries.

I found the segments on the history of the franchise and the extended interviews to be the most interesting.

This set contains over four hours of features.  This is a Halloween franchise lover's dream.  I highly recommend it.",1285372800,,2180,5.144886363636363
2560307,5,B000FC2GA0,"This collection is a relatively definitive retrospective / documentary on the Halloween franchise. It goes through all the movies, with tons of behind the scenes trivia and information, special effects, interviews with writers, directors, actors, etc. It even includes info on part 3, which arguably has NOTHING to do with the rest of the series. Nonetheless, they talk about it, what the idea was, how they remedied it with part 4 returning to focus on Myers, etc.

Plenty of extra features, etc. A great set for Halloween, slasher film or horror movie fans.

It's ALL there!
Loaded with rare clips, photos and always amusing ""Interviews""...this Documentary
covers the whole series up to ""Halloween Resurrection""...but Rob Zombie (strangely enough) is there to talk about his love for the film, at least 3 years before a remake was even considered!
The only thing that isn't mentioned as an inspiration for the series is the 1973 sci-fi film, ""Westworld"" which was actually the first to show a relentless, almost indestructible antagonist that could not be stopped no matter what the hero did!

2560311,5,B000FC2GA0,"In 1978, filmmakers John Carpenter and Debra Hill unleashed one of the most original and unique horror movies of all time ""Halloween"". Made on a low budget with Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut and Donald Pleasance of ""The Great Escape"" fame in the starring role, this little independent slasher movie introduced a new cinematic villain known as Michael Myers, the film opened in October of 1978 to huge box-office openings for the past six weeks becoming the highest grossing independent movie of all time even with great critical response. A legend was born to this day spawning sequels, knock-offs (""Friday The 13th"" being the most famous of knock-offs), merchandise, a fanbase and more. Here is a documentary that takes a look inside the history of the classic to it's sequels with fans like Rob Zombie, Edgar Wright and Clive Barker interviewing their love for the original Halloween movie and is narrated by PJ Soles from the movie. This Documentary even has interviews with stars and producers like Moustappha Akkad (Before his death), Jamie Lee Curtis, John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Tom Atkins, Greg Nicotero, Nick Castle, Tommy Lee Wallace, Rick Rosenthal, Allan Howarth, and many more as they give a retrospective on each movie of the unforgettable epic horror saga including their triumphs, controversies, troubles and fame including why Michael Myers is sooo popular.

No, it's two DVDs worth of material from the 58 Halloween documentaries made since the film, including a totally new documentary, as well as new material, convention scenes from the Halloween convention (or one of them), more interviews, footage, interviews with the traffic cops who closed down the streets one day to shoot part of Halloween, more info, interviews, stuff, etc, etc, etc.

Too much material for most sane folk, but a treat for Halloween or Carpenter addicts (who obviously must have made this).  The new documentary is narrated by PJ Soles, of Halloween and Carrie and fandom fame, and a whole bunch of folks appear to talk about this seminal horror film.  We get some insight into the many sequels and some debate on the various masks used (is it that hard to recreate the low-budget mask of the first two?)

Again, recommended for addicts, of course.  Others may want to pick up one of the 127 or so versions of the film itself released on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, Blu Ray, and wax cylinder over the years.",1190937600,2,1094,4.854838709677419

When it finally hit store shelves I had mine reserved and it was a good thing because they were all sold out once I got there.  I guess that just goes to show how popular this series is.

This is a two DVD set, which I find suitable considering Anchor Bay had  years to put this together.  It contains interviews, fan footage, a lot of scenes filmed from the ""Halloween Returns To Haddonfield"" convention from 2003, and my personal favorite...filming locations presented by Sean Clark.

For those who are unaware this in NOT a new Halloween sequel nor is it a newly released version of the classic.  It is a documentary on the Halloween film series.  So if you are interested in the Halloween franchise or a fan of the genre this is a film that is sure to interest you.

Of special note is the interview of NANCY LOOMIS (Annie, H1).  Ms. Loomis stepped away from the spotlight a number of years ago, so what a treat to hear her thoughts on her character and the classic film.

An added bonus is the inclusion of clips from the 2003 Halloween Returns to Haddonfield Convention.  These clips are panel discussions with cast members and behind the scenes artists.

This DVD is a most complete look at one of the scariest movie horror franchise that refuses to die!  Enjoy..",1162771200,7,738,4.623076923076923
2560340,4,B000FC2GA0,"Similar to the discouraged fans below, I found that Halloween: 25 Years of Terror was more of a keepsake rather than a documentary of true historic value. This is a film filled with trivia seen on any of the documentaries from the countless Halloween DVDs, yet spliced with Ritalin hyped fans that seem a bit youthful rather than insightful--were any demographics taken into account of this?

However, this is a wet dream for any Halloween fan--which would include myself.

Having P.J. Soles narrating the film was a nice touch. She doesn't falter or seem disoriented from the source material either. She adds to the flow of the film which is good since usually documentaries seem to run amok in mud and grow tiresome after awhile.

Though what is bothersome is the abundance of interviews, yet only the mere minute (and even less) that are shown on the actual documentary. I found more insightful material in the bonus features, which flood the DVD making the release all the better. You just need to look around for what answers you want to find.

Then again, making a documentary on the films themselves is a bit tedious, and the director does an exceptional job, only that it seems more of a documentary on the convention rather than the series.

Nevertheless, this is a set that anyone interested or already in love with the series has to have. With the rocky roads and handy patch work the Halloween series has received, it's nice to know someone has bandaged it up and managed to package together something that seems to correlate with one another.

That just doesn't happen in the storyline of Michael Myers. And everyone knows that.",1161820800,,1641,4.780918727915195
2560351,4,B000FC2GA0,"Basically everything you ever want to know about the films. Even though I dismiss everything after the third. The third was new and original but pissed people off with no Michael, what were they thinking by calling it Halloween 3, marketing at its lowest. Not that bad of a film on its own, if you believe pigs can fly, lol. My opinion, Halloween 2, the Doc and Michael blew up and burned to death, end of story. But it is intriguing to hear from cast members, fans, and the trip back to Haddonfield is awesome. I will be visiting Passadena, California soon, pretty much evrything is the same except for the Wallace house. It is obvious the owners want nothing to do with it, what a shame. If you love the films pick it up, you will not be dissapointed, by the way, Happy Halloween!",1160352000,,782,4.4
2560352,3,B000FC2GA0,"Sad that they only seemed to interview the fans who are under the age of 26 or 27 and appear to have no intelligence or true insight about filmaking or storytelling, and only care about the violence or nudity.  There really ARE older fans who care about the series for its style and suspense too.

  I still don't quite understand the bashing that Halloween 5 is given on this disc, as, with the exception of perhaps H2O the film has an amazing amount of mood and suspense close to that of the original, despite the 80's clothing and hair and the goofy policemen.

It would have been nice to see more interviews, and longer interviews with some of the actors.  Jamie Lee Curtis' involvement is simply a replay of interviews from the set of ""H2O"" that have been available before on other discs.  If they're going to re-use the footage, give us more of it, or an unedited interview.

Tony Moran, who played Michael in some small parts in the original is making the convention rounds nowand yet is curiously absent here.  To hear about how his involvement came about would have been interesting, as well as his take on the popularity, as he seems amazed when one meets him at conventions, as though he had no clue that Halloween was a watershed film.

The convention interviews are nice, but more up close personal interviews would have been better.  PJ SOles, who narrated the documentaryt, is a fount of knowledge and stories, having spoken with her once. It would have been great to hear her speak more about the film and the experience as well as with her costar Loomis. For an big retrospective, its decidedly lacking considering so many of the original actors and the director are still more than alive and kickig.

This DVD is more of a fanboys convention dream come to life than a true documentary. And as an adult fan of the series, I'm embarrassed to show people the fan interviews, as I don't want them to think that I'm like that.

It's better than nothing, but still a bit of a disapointment.

Hopefully someone will step up to the plate and really do a good documentary about the making of the films, their popularity/lack of during different periods within our society, the acotrs background stories of working on the films, what has happened to them since then. and how about something new with Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter?",1157846400,13,2344,4.6168674698795185

It's chock full of goodies, just like your trusty Halloween candy bag from days of trick or treating.",1156896000,,251,4.478260869565218
2560354,4,B000FC2GA0,"I really enjoyed the retrospective disc one,which went over the highlights of the films as well as the future of the franchise.  The convention footage was a bit excessive, though.  I guess they had to find more ways to fill up 2 discs.

But, it is a must-have for die-hard Halloween fans, if only for the really cool DVD box.",1156464000,,326,4.4
2560355,5,B000FC2GA0,"I met Danielle Harris about two weeks ago at a horror convention, and she had a poster with her promoting this DVD set. I bought it just last week, and watched it two nights ago. I was blown away! If you are a fan of the Halloween films....you have to buy this and own this! Keep in mind, this is NOT a reissue of Halloween- it is a documentary film along with much, much more! I do not think you will be in any way disappointed with this purchase.",1155254400,5,448,4.044943820224719

It is a documentary with loads of special features including interviews with all sorts of cast and crew from ALL of the Halloween movies... even # 3!  Over 4 hours worth of material... none of the feature length films are reissued on this dvd in any way, shape, or form.  Why don't you morons who are lowering the average rating of this dvd by giving 1 or 2 stars read the godd**n features of the disc before reviewing..  .  stupid!...",1154217600,7,550,4.396039603960396

2560359,5,B000FC2GA0,"Certainly John Carpenter had no idea what sort of an impact he would be making when he created his masterpiece, ""Halloween"" in 1978. Not only did the movie go on to be the most successful independent feature of it's time, but it spawned seven sequels, which in turn gave birth to a large and loyal fanbase. ""Halloween: 25 Years Of Terror,"" a two-disc DVD set, centered around an in-depth documentary, celebrates that. Captured at a 2003 convention to mark the 25th anniversary (hence the title), this set beautifully covers nearly every angle of all eight ""Halloween"" films, their effect on the industry, their successes, their failures, and so on and so forth.

The documentary itself, clocking it at the length of the average ""Halloween"" film, traces the history of the franchise, from the baby stages of the original film, to the ridiculous nature of the most recent installment, ""Halloween: Resurrection."" Nothing is really held back here. The producers, directors and castmembers are not shy about revealing certain problems encountered during production (especially on parts 2 and 6) but also don't treat the films as complete failures, or as cinematic scum, as some critics might label it. If you own access to the internet and have done enough research on the films, this information may not be any news to you, but it's nice to have all the wrinkles ironed out and to hear it straight from the source. We get interviews from the legends, such as Jamie Lee Curtis, John Carpenter and Danielle Harris, to the lesser-knowns like Sasha Jenson, Marianne Hagan and Pamela Susan Shoop, and are even treated to input from everyone from internet critic John Fallon (Arrow In The Head) to future ""Halloween"" director/reinventor himself, Rob Zombie. I was intrigued by the documentary, and was only disappointed when it ended.

Now, for Special Features, we have more than enough to overlap the feature presentation. Most of the footage you will see is from the previously mentioned convention. We are treated to loads of panel discussions, centering around the first film, part 2 and part 6, and also featuring a wealth of cast and crew. Probably one of the best and most nostalgic features would be the on-set footage of ""Halloween 5,"" while ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds"" is a well done tour of Haddonfield (Pasadena, CA) as it appears today. I was very satisfied with this release, but it also left me a little depressed. Afterall, with the announcement of the upcoming remake/reinvention/reimagining/ -- whatever you wanna call it -- of the original film, it is officially clear that all these storylines are dead. I guess we all knew it. It was essentially over when ""H20"" came on the scene and tried to end the series definitively, and then ""Halloween: Resurrection"" came out and dragged the series through the mud and put the nail in the coffin. It's sad to see such great characters and, for better of for worse, great stories reach a dead-end. As a hardcore ""Halloween"" fan who also loved parts 4-6, it was a vindicating feeling to see that virtually no one from ""H20"" or ""Resurrection"" bothered to show up and discuss the films. It was all people from the older films. After witnessing the older, mid-section films being treated as dirt over the years, it was nice to see it gets it's respect here. If you are a ""Halloween"" fan, regardless of what your opinion of the rest of the franchise is/was, this set is worth every penny. With so many ""Halloween"" DVD's and so little features, it's nice to have a place that holds just about everything you could ever want.",1154044800,32,3569,4.868421052631579
2560360,5,B000FC2GA0,"Three years overdue, but worth every minute of the wait. Folks, if you are die hard Halloween fans, then this is your holy grail. The 2 disc release is jam packed with nothing but great Halloween goodness. I don't know where to even begin!. First, there's the documentary. Clocking in at 84 minutes(with credits), this is the definitive Halloween docu that every one has been waiting for. It traces the series' history and it's legacy. The usuals like John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, PJ Soles, and so on are there, but you will see other people who were involved that you(or at least I)hardly ever see. I'm talking about Nancy Loomis, Sasha Jenson, Kathleen Kinmont, and all the Michaels. It really is a treat. It's narrated by Soles as well. The documentary is great and well made. It touches on everything, and maybe some things you didn't know about. It wasn't afraid to hit upon the series' failures either. The dysmal box office of Part 5, and the incredible mess that was Part 6. It's all here. The rest of the disc is filled to the breaking point with great features. A lot of material was filmed at the 25th anniversary convention in Pasadena. There is a still gallery of the event, plus a live montage of the festivities. You get to see the panel discussions for Halloween 1, Halloween 2, Halloween 6, and a panel discussion with Ellie Cornell(Rachel), Irwin Yablans and Moustapha Akkad, DP Dean Cundey, and one with all the Michaels!. There is a great 18 minute feature where we get a tour on some of the filming locations used in Halloween 1. There is also a still gallery of shooting locations as well. PJ Soles even comes along on the tour. Halloween 5 gets singled out a bit, as there is never before seen footage from the set!. One of the best features here is the work done by the fans. There is a segment where we get to see the fans' homemade movies, and some of them are doozies!. Check out the stop animation one. Fans' artwork is also on display. There is a short section on a Halloween 9 coontest where a lucky attendee wins a walk on role in the next film. Now that the next film has changed drastically, I wonder if she will still get to be a part of it?. I'm sure she will. What else?. An interesting comin book also comes with the package. Interviews abound on the disc. There are extended interviews with some Halloween 2 cast members, and an interview segment on Halloween 3(Tom Atkins, Tommy Lee Wallace, and others). I don't know what's going to happen with the future of Halloween, or how Rob Zombie is going to treat it. Hopefully, he will see this release and know what the people like and want. I don't want a 'Devil's Rejects' kind of Halloween movie. As a life long fan who has gotten his hands on the big Halloween re-issues and stuff, this one takes the cake. You need to get this and enjoy the night he came home over and over again.",1153958400,6,2874,4.465779467680608

8120554,3,B000FC2GA0,"This documentation of all 8 Halloween films was very boring at times. I did learn a few things that I didn't know. But it was 3 hours of interviews with the cast from Halloween 1, 2, 4, 5, & 6. It was nice to see P. J. Soles again. But No sign of Jamie Lee Curtis. Why bother to do a Halloween documentation if you can't get it's main star ""Jamie Lee Curtis"" to be a part of it. Donald Pleasance is dead so I understand about him. But No Jamie? Go figure. That's like having a Friday the 13th reunion with out Kevin Bacon. Which they've done that before as well. I did enjoy parts of the documentary. But other parts were boring. The only reason I bought this movie was to add to my Halloween collection. If your not a fan of the Halloween movies, Don't waste your money on this DVD.",1478044800,,783,4.090909090909091
